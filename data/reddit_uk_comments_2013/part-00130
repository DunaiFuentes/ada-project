Also i think you're wrong in thinking that Allen is a defensive midfielder. He has a good pass and is not a bad tackler but i feel the reason Rodgers brought him in was to play where Herdo played this season, as thats where he operated with Swansea along win Britton in a weird form of 4-1-4-1 and between them had more passes than any other midfield pairing in europe at one stage. Only because of the lack of depth in the squad he had to play Henderson, and it bared fruit in the last 2 months of the season, especially working with Sturridge.  If your going to say that Allen and Henderson don't have the quality to operate a 2 man attacking midfield like Barca then you're dead right. But Iniesta and Xavi have 17 years more football experience between them playing for a club like barca, in the champions league every year and playing with players like Ronaldinho, Alves, Villa, Messi, Ibra... etc etc

Basically think you are right that to get into that top 4 then top 2 etc, then 'more quality is needed'-BR. If you look at the the top 4 players like Mata, Hazard, Corzola, Silva, Toure, Kagawa, and Carrick are all massive parts of why their teams are so strong.

true,ActionPriest,null,null,"Surely its worth accepting as generally true that at lower levels of income the spend on certain necessities such as groceries and transport will be significantly higher as a proportion of their income than on other areas such as household goods?

To give an example the top decile spends about 3 times as much on food and non alcoholic drinks as the bottom decile. However when it comes to clothing and footwear they spend around NINE times as the bottom decile, and nearly 6 times as much on household goods [Cite](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/family-spending/family-spending/family-spending-2012-edition/index.html)

Of particular note in relevance to this argument, is that for the all the lower 5 deciles (ie half the country) spending on household goods is LESS than half the grocery spend. In ten years a household in the 5th decile group will spend just around £13000 on household goods. Someone in the second bottom decile will spend £5400 on household goods, versus over £17000 on groceries.

This isn't really about personal circumstance, so much as that the aggregate spending habits of society overall don't really translate to the actual inflation that's experienced by people on lower incomes.

He's not just dealing with his individual spending habits, but the general circumstances faced by at the average salary and below.

FYI if you really spent that much on household goods, then it puts you in the top 20% of UK households by that measure. Given most UK households do not even have dishwashers, let alone the ability to replace them regularly, along with their other white goods and furnishings that does not seem unlikely.

- After going to the National Museum, go to The Royal Oak. Really wee pub, but usually has live music there, and it's traditional folk and all that. It's really worth your time.

- If you go to the Royal Botanic Gardens (which I really encourage you to) and want to go to Stockbridge, you can have a pint at The Monkey Tap, The Bailie and a cocktail at the Last Word. Really nice places to get a pint.

- After walking all that much in Princes Street and the Princes Street gardens, perhaps you could go to grab some food at The Standing Order. Huge place, used to be a bank, now it's  huge pub. Decent priced and the food is not bad at all (IMHO). After that, you can go to The Dome. Really beautiful place, and the pints are not expensive either. And from there you can go to the Royal Cafe, another fantastic place to grab a drink.

If you want to drink some whisky, there are tons of places, but for me, The Bow Bar in Victoria Street is the best option. Never too empty / too crowded, huge selection of whiskies and decent priced. Also it's really near Grassmarket so you have a great selection of pubs to go.

Hope you enjoy your stay! I live really close to the royal botanic gardens, so if you plan to go for a pint arond there, just tell it here. Maybe we could have a pint (or not).

And about your travel, if I were you, I'd go to the hottest woman (or man, or whatever is your thing, this is reddit, we never judge people in public) I know, tell her if she wanna come to Edinburgh with me, and when she says no, say, ""Okay"" and when you come back, show her all the amazing photos you are gonna get, and some decent stories, and walk away towards the sunset like a fucking pro.

Probably one of the more divisive ""stay or go"" choices. And I think I'm done with him. I was never that happy about it to begin with, and he infuriated me for large portions of the season, especially early on. I think he's a good player, but he is not spurs quality. For one thing, his favoured position...well, I'm still not sure what it is. I'm not sure what he brings to the team aside from poaching. Now, I know some of you will talk to me about those utterly vital goals he scored- I'm thinking both of his against united, his one against city at our place. There were more, I'm not trying to belittle that contribution. My point is that a proper striker would have no problem putting away the same chances. 

Aside from those important goals, he didn't bring a lot else imo. He's not especially creative, quick, or good on the ball. Siggy put him in the shade playing the same position, and the Icelander was picking it up as he went along.

But he still gets to sell the house. It still belongs to him until he chooses to sell. He still has that right. 

This argument is nothing to do with owning the house in perpetuity.

Any more then you have no right to income because the government wants a percentage when you get it. 

But I could also place thw house in a trust. Call it the family cat home. Leave the home to my son in trust with the requirement that he house all my pussys. This is then a charity and tax free.

In mich the same way the crown estate is open to the public and allows you to go look at english history.

If my son then decided his son was not really a pussy man. He could then disolve the trust on his death. Passing the tax liability off for a generatiion. Sorta like charles the 3rd did. 

EDIT: it is worth noting charity is not the only way of doing this. Farms are almost always LTD companies. Allowing the assets and land to be passed down through the family for generation after generation.

That not enougth land for farming. But I could set it up as a nersery. Or any other type of company. Even if I rent it out. I can register as a LTD and pass the profit through that company. Pass the directorship of the company to my son.

true,The_Sponge_Of_Wrath,null,null,"&gt; I suspect the real reason is businesses in the US wanted to cut costs and pass the cost on to the consumer, and somehow managed to brainwash the Americans into eating that shit up. 

I actually believe this also. Consumerism and commercialism dictate that he with the lowest prices *generally* draws the majority of customers. The moment one restauranteur has the bright idea of dropping staff wages to a negligible amount and expecting customers to make the rest up with tips is the moment more customers flock to them because their prices are suddenly much lower than those of their competitors. Then every restaurant around has to do it or face closure.

Spending time with American friends in the USA has made it very clear to me that most Americans do *not include the tip* when telling themselves how much a meal cost. ""That was only ten bucks!"" No! It wasn't! You got taxed, then you gave your server twice (or more) the tax as a tip! Your meal just *cost* you ~$15!

Chatting to American wait staff has also made it very clear that they earn far, far more in tips than I ever did as a relatively well-paid office manager. One boasted to me that he *averaged* $100 a day in tips, and that a lady he worked with pulled double that because legs, boobs, and blonde. It's also very clear that in larger cities a lot of wait staff expect tips regardless of the service they've offered, and will kick up a shitstorm if you don't give them what they believe they are ""owed"" (bear in mind I am talking tips, not service charge). I've had wait staff in NYC tell me baldly exactly how much I should tip when they set the bill down. This makes me not tip them at all, which then perpetuates the idea that the British are lousy tippers. I've heard tell of Americans being taken aside by wait staff to be told ""Your [British] friends know they have to tip, right?""

No. We don't *have* to tip just to make up for the fact that there is a culture whereby shitty wages are acceptable and the customer is expected to make up for it and still think their food was a bargain.

I think a lot of it is when Catherine is acting dimwitted and loud mouthed in other roles, that's the joke. She's making fun of those characteristics. However, when she plays Donna, it just comes off as her character being dimwitted and loud mouthed. Even near the end of her run, it frustrates me when she just shouts at things/people when she doesn't understand what's going on.

I think the perfect example is during Silence in the Library. In the episode River is trying to explain how she knows The Doctor, but she's from his future so he doesn't know her. However, the entire time Donna is just yelling as though River were presenting her some calculus equation to solve, and even The Doctor tells her to be quiet. Of course, despite this, Forest of the Dead is probably the one episode I can actually tolerate her in, and feel bad for her by the end. Seriously, as emotional as people claim her end to be in Journey's End, I think the better conclusion is during Forest of the Dead. I feel nothing for her character at the end of Journey's End, but as much as I'm not fond of her character, Forest of the Dead gets me every time.",0,1372407342,null,0,false,0,carvae7,t3_1h8g3g,t1_carvae7,t3_1h8g3g,null,1430655064,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0

On Facebook, one might get the opposite impression, with a minority posting a daily barrage of tediously partisan links, soundbites and captioned photos followed with such insightful and decimating commentary such as ""This."" or merely stating their political opponents are ""wankers"" with scant evidence to back up this claim.

Anyway, your question is slightly misleading - there is not much that you would actually recognise as a ""taboo"" here; nobody will *ever* call you out when you violate one of them, they will simply laugh nervously and change the subject, or simply make a slight face. You might be pressed to notice it.

But if you're here to sample the culture it should be quite easy to illicit this reaction if you wish to see it though, particularly in London. Try any of the following: mention recent NHS scandals or generally imply universal healthcare is sub-standard, imply the BBC is partisan, anything positive whatsoever about Tony Blair, mention that having a Royal family makes the country look laughable to outsiders, state you believe even extremist political groups have a right to voice their opinion, etc. etc. Good luck!",0,1372408861,null,0,false,0,carvi71,t3_1h8hte,t1_carvi71,t3_1h8hte,null,1430654962,4,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,4

My point generally is that the geometric mean of the items selected by CPI does NOT reflect the circumstances faced at the average income, which is its claimed purpose as a measure, and is the justification for the uses to which it is applied.

Outlier consumer behaviour which skews those results is, frankly, irrelevant to it as a measure, and CPI gives them substantial amounts of undue weight, to an extent not found in other measures such as RPI. 

If the goal is simply to track the level of money in a society there are a RAFT of other, far better measures, such as M3. We can track velocity and volume if we want too. They do not use that, instead they use a measure specifically tailored to the identifying the cost of the average ""shopping basket"". As constituted currently it fails, both in concept, and in practice, as the statistics indicate.

There's really no value in a vague measure that produces a mean of an essentially randomly selected group of spending activities. As it stands it means nothing: it is information produced that tells you ONLY what an arbitrary manufactured statistic is. It COULD have meaning, were it constructed in a manner that said something coherent about a uniform area of consumer spending. As constructed it does not.

Is it really relevant when setting levels of subsistence benefits to know that a small number of rich people are getting great deal on high end white goods?

true,[deleted],null,null,"I'm not saying that £500 tenancy fees are reasonable, but normally when I go to view a flat I meet the estate agent at their office (normally near a tube station), then they drive me to the flat, show me round, drive me back to their office or drop me off somewhere convenient en-route and then make some calls on my behalf of I've got questions about furnishings or similar. So that's not exactly highly skilled work but it's at least 25 minutes of someone's time. Most people I know will go to 5-10 viewings before finding a place.

So we're talking 2-4 hours of someone else's time and I'd say that's an conservative estimate. For a two bed flat that I recently moved in to, the total fees were around £225.

My point is that letting fees are probably high and the agents do also take a cut (10-12% I think) from the landlord, but you're not just paying for someone to hand you over the keys *once* you have found somewhere.

Even direct lettings on the internet won't kill this off completely as someone needs to show tenants around properties at short notice. Most landlords presumably have jobs and/or don't live close to the property and so it makes sense for them to delegate rather than spending several weeks per year time arranging viewings and running around town.

true,syntax,cnty-scotland,Stravaigin,"Technically, the initial description of homeopathy is a little bit more subtle than that.  I've not love for the thing (it's junk), but you can't deal with proponents if you have an inaccurate description (else they write you off as 'not knowing what you are talking about').

The core idea is 'like cures like' - so find something that _causes_ the same symptoms as one is experiencing.  [0]

Then add that to water, and perform succussion.  This is sealing the tube with the active ingredient and water, and banging it on a leather surface. [1]

The liquid is the goes through a series of 'potentisation' steps, where a small amount of the water from one batch is added to the next, and succussion is performed.  Apparently, this 'activates' the 'vital energy' of the diluted substance, and makes it stronger.

Thus, the more dilutions, the 'stronger' the 'remedy' gets.  Somehow, the succussion process is what makes it different from just a mass dilution.  I have had great millage in attacking the succussion step, to persuade people that homeopathy is bunk.  (e.g. Why is it 10 strikes?; what if it's an elastic container and a hard surface, does that work?; details of what the surface needs to be)


[0] There's a whole set of things called 'provings', which is the accepted way to know what is what.  This is where healthy volunteers take a 'remedy', and document the symptoms it produces, so as to know what the things it will cure are.  During the process of proving, various things are banned, such as playing chess (!), and a journal is kept.

[1] Good questions to ask a proponent: What sort of leather is more effective?  Goat, sheep or cow?  How did they determine this?  Or, if using a machine, how did they determine that it's just as effective?",0,1372412115,null,0,false,0,carvxi9,t3_1h7g2b,t1_carvxi9,t1_carvb6x,null,1430654761,26,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,26

true,[deleted],null,null,"I had to let my flat 3 years ago, as I moved for work. Tried to sell it first, but I could not with the market being so shit. I  could not afford to leave it empty, so I rented.

I approached a few agents and soon learned that they also fleece the landlords, just as much as they do tenants. 

I decided to go it alone and found a company who would put an advert on rightmove and then credit check anyone who applied. If they passed credit checks, I qualified for rent protection insurance. 

I got my first tenants within one week. I met them personally so they could see just who they would be dealing with and knew just where they stood. The only fee they had to pay was an admin fee of 80 pounds which was to help towards gas safety check and the mentioned credit check / advert fees (I paid the other half and a bit more). The only other cost was a month in advance and a deposit which went direct to deposit protection scheme.

I was lucky that I got some good tenants and I went out of my way to make sure they were happy and everything worked well for them. I had a boiler heating and electric breakdown cover which meant if anything went wrong someone would be with them in 24 hours and the tenant could also call them out direct.

Overall it was a pleasant experience for both parties. Hopefully other landlords learn to go direct too as agents are really not needed unless perhaps you're out of the country or just don't want anything to do with it. 

Same for tenants, if you can try to go direct, or at least try to find private landlords as a first option to narrow out. ",0,1372412227,null,0,1372413755,0,carvy0e,t3_1h6h2v,t1_carvy0e,t1_carcaxh,null,1430654755,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

You put up your own advert (text, photos etc) onto the visum site and they then propagate the advert onto a lot of different sites (rightmove being the main one).

Tenants then call visum and they act as an answering service who direct them to you. That way if your at work during the day, someone collects the calls for you.

Really good service. With companies like this, you don't need a letting agent charging you crap loads for doing the same thing + taking 10% of the rent each month.

Just get good boiler cover. Rent insurance protection and you\'re good to go. That just leaves you to do any little repairs yourself (normally stuff like a cupboard door everynow and then). Quite often the tenants will offer to do the repairs themselves. You then deduct the amount it cost them from the rent.

The problem is that a lot of the stuff you list, people would pay for because they don't know their rights. 

""Tenant must steam-clean carpets"" would be unenforceable in a tenancy agreement here, unless the carpets were steam-cleaned prior to commencement of the lease. The tenant only has a responsibility to return the property to the same condition as at the start of the tenancy, allowing for ""fair wear and tear"" (cleaning is never fair wear and tear). If the landlord says ""you need to clean the carpets"", and they hadn't before you moved in, that's a case of betterment - i.e., they're using your deposit to return the property to a better standard than when you moved in. 

Betterment is not allowed and any term in a contract which could be used to facilitate it is likely to be considered an ""Unfair term""... and thus unenforceable in all contexts.

There are some interesting consequences of the betterment rules as well. Say you fuck up a sofa and it needs replacing. It could cost £400. But say the sofa was already 10 years old - you cannot be liable for the cost of an ""as new"" replacement - just the cost of a 10-year-old used replacement (give-or-take).

The law here is that all deposits must be kept by one of three (in England) central agencies. If the landlord fails to give your deposit to a deposit protection service, you can sue him/her for three times the value of the deposit. 

Disputes should go through the agency... but they are decided by arbitration with no opportunity for the tenant and landlord to debate by responding to eachothers' arguments. Just two written submissions...

Unfortunately, in my experience, the deposit agency seemed to ignore the precise law and instead apply a 50/50 split to the deposit. Small claims court is the only alternative instead of (or even after) arbitration.

Jonjo was the hottest player in the Championship while on loan with Blackpool and sadly due to Lucas getting injured we had to pull him back. We've been unable to send him back on loan due to new players coming in getting injure or playing poorly. His playing time has been inconsistent and as a result his performances have been as well. Combine that with being played well out of position and his natural depth and you've got a recipe for A FEW bad moments across an entire season for a guy who's still years younger than Henderson.

But homeopathy didn't keep up with the development of modern pharmaceuticals and gradually descended into the cess-pit of woo in which it is enmired to this day. 

The main argument against ditching it completely is that there's some suggestion of an enhanced placebo effect -- if people believe in it, it works on them to some extent.

Cider is likely to be far stronger than you realise if it is of good quality. 6,7,8% is normal, and you are likely not to be able to tell it is that strong by taste. It will normally be subdivided into dry, medium and sweet, which are going to be fairly obvious descriptions. If it calls itself scrumpy, that is a good sign, although not universal. If the bar is serving from a large box on the back bar, get some, it is from a smaller producer. /u/The_Technogoat gives good advice, these are all larger producers, available nationally. Personal opinion is that it will always be worth trying the output of the smaller producers. Sometimes, you will get a bad pint, but hey, variety is the spice of life. 

On that theme, try perry too. It is cider made with pears, and tends to be sweeter, but very nice.

It seemed fairly implicit to me that the reference to rent was examplary, and not intended to be exclusive: there is a great deal more to domicile costs, ignored by CPI, than just private rents, as you well know. Nor is it the only element ignored, or given innappropriate weighting by CPI.

The entire basis for the justification to switch to CPI given by the treasury was that it provides  “a more appropriate measure of benefit and pension recipients’ experiences of inflation.""[*](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:f7GwstE44NYJ:www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN05649.pdf+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk)

 It is explicitly there to exist as a measure of public experience. Per the ONS own statistics, it does not do this. The ONS may not identify it as such, but the treasury does, and it is they who made the choice to use this measure, and who decide what policies it is used to support.

Once you sort the transport out, people with jobs will move there because it's cheaper than neighbouring areas (gentrification), they in turn will bring more commercial activity along with them which provides a permanent basis for employment of the original residents. 

There are downsides to gentrification too of course, but as it is Tottenham is pretty much isolated from the rest of the city, and that needs to change in order for it to substantially improve.

The rest of your post is rather generic, and the sort of thing that doesn't really lend itself to useful discussion because it removes the real science and brings in hypothetical ethics, like your 'designer baby' debate.

The government would raise their income and we wouldn't have gone down a road that's incredibly difficult to reverse all for the sake of a one off cash injection. Stupid, STUPID Danny Alexander.

With private companies sinking their claws in to university students - the people who will eventually be paying your pension and hopefully furthering this country, I fear we'll soon be seeing the likes of Wonga student loans.

&gt;“Intellectual property crime has long been a problem in the world of physical goods, but with the growing use of the internet, online intellectual property crime is now an increasing threat to our creative industries. These industries are worth more than £36 billion a year and employ more than 1.5 million people,” Lord Younger said.

Well, it's nice that our 'creative industries' (I'm assuming films, videogame companies, ect.) hire a lot of people, but have you actually got any evidence that torrent sites have a major effect on profits? I can sort of see how it effects the videogame industry (I think the Witcher 2 had something like 4 million copies pirated), but these schemes are all being lobbied by film and music companies, who are making a tonne of money. As CD Project Red have said, you need to give people an incentive to buy.

- Rounds. If you meet a group of people at a bar, chances are they will be on rounds. Each person will take a turn to buy a ""round"" of drinks for the group. Even if you are late to the group, it is expected you will ""stand your round"". Accepting drinks and not reciprocating is the height of poor etiquette. (Some groups will form a ""whip"" where each member puts in to a pool to pay for drinks. Later joiners may be given a discretionary discount).

- Tipping. This is not a regular feature of pubs and is not expected, even if they put your change on a little silver plate (I'm looking at you, All Bar One). Bar staff, by and large, are reasonably well paid and tips are not used to supplement pay. If you wish to tip, a quick ""keep the change"" will suffice when paying, or ""one for yourself"" if you would like to offer them a drink.

- Talking to people. As someone else has stated, those at the bar are usually happy to talk to strangers, those sat elsewhere less so. Bear in mind the usual British reticence - don't force yourself on a group or other people; sometimes people just want a pint in peace (but will be too polite to say so....)

- Drinking. A ""what's good?"" to the barman is a good start - but please don't do it when the pub is busy.

true,Thetonn,eng-sussex,Sussex,"So, Northern Ireland's politics are exceptionally interesting, particularly for people who get annoyed by the typical lazy cliches about politics.

They have an exceptionally limited parliament which can barely get anything done. This is because they need all the parties, under power sharing, to support it.

This means democracy isn't really working. The only areas where both sides agree are either obvious, like education, or pointless, like FLAGS!

This is what happens when we get consensus, when we guarantee all parties a say, when all the parties 'stand on principles'. The result isn't a magical, happy utopia, it's is gridlock, low turnout, and threats of riots.

You assume the reason hey do nothing is because they don't want to. They can't do anything because each party is purely dedicated to their own areas. The see each and every pound of investment as another battle, and they all need to agree.

In my opinion, either the people of Northern Ireland have to accept that they have a shit political system which is better than a return to the troubles, or they can get a proper system designed to actually matter which increases the chance of more death, destruction and terrorism.

However, as an Englishman, I will just be here, twiddling my thumbs till you make up your mind.

I think the best results would come from herbal medicines that actually are helpful but may not be so powerful - so for example  St. John's wort actually has empirical evidence in depression, there are many others with clinical effectiveness in colds, anxiety, aches and pains etc. all of which constitute a lot of the GP work load. I would probably go down the line of creating a Senior Nurse Therapist who would explain in great detail why the herbs were effective and emphasise the necessity of regular ritual in the use of the herbs. The herbs would come in striking packages. There might be words and a short visualisation / meditation - the herbs may come in tea form that has to be steeped for a few minutes. The nurse could explain that the effectiveness was directly related to the active participation of the patient and that this was a clinically robust effect.

This would have a massive effect for low cost a lot of the resistance is that it challenges the old fashioned 1950's technology / progress / professionals mindset within the heath industry. Cheap and utilitarian is not in either doctors or pharmaceutical industries perceived best interests.

But if you do strike up a conversation, its probably best to know about current UK politics as most of the people I know care little about US politics or are oblivious to what's going on across the pond.

If you look at the byline of the article, you'll notice that there is actually a name attached to it. That means that there is some truth to it - otherwise it would have a bland name like 'Sun Reporter'. Moreover, the buzz from generally reliable Twitter users, such as Andrew Haigh and Leon Wobschall (the YEP Sports Writer who appears to be covering for Phil Hay) seems to indicate that they believe it is happening as well.

Personally, I don't give a monkey's about Morison. His attitude on the pitch has never once indicated that he wants to give his all and win games for Leeds. I appreciate that he doesn't appear to have been fully fit last season, but he played plenty of games and I never saw even a glimpse of his performance and attitude improving (Palace game aside) - in fact, in my opinion it was getting worse by the game. Having a player in your team who does nothing when you've seen him tear teams apart before is an unbelievably frustrating feeling. I was genuinely surprised when the YEP reported that ""sources close to Morison"" have said that he is ""very happy"" at Leeds because he never once seemed to be.

On a more spiteful note, I'm also happy to shut down Warnock's prophecy that he would be a Leeds legend ""and they'll say, ""that bloody Warnock was the one who signed him."""" Yes, *that bloody Warnock* was the one who sold our best striker in years and brought in this flop to replace him.

That is like me saying because I have my PhD I can then comment with some authority on the Hadron Collider. Errr... nooo. 
Saying the word 'phenotype' is hardly showing off with terminology, it is using the correct terminology for what is being discussed. If people want to know, they can look it up or ask.  In fact, I cannot thin of an alternative word to phenotype, but that is possible just because it is ingrained. 

&gt; completely understand the difference between nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA - no need to explain that to me. 

Given your previous comment this really wasn't clear, hence I waffled on. 

&gt; I'm not sure what you mean by ""people like me"". It's not ""hypothetical ethics"" at all - we need to establish principles before our technical capabilities catch up.

People like you, as in people who have made those links and comments when really there is no need to. We already have the principals established, the ethics board are already pretty clear on what is and isn't acceptable. No one in their right and sound mind would think designer babies are a good idea, 'cept a few nutty scientists and assorted weirdo parents. 

&gt;edit: I'd also point out that this is a major problem with science communication IMO. Lots of scientists are too far up their own arses. They think that they are the only ones with the right answers and act high and mighty when anybody SEEMS to be disagreeing with them or raising a different point. 

I work with people like that, I could not agree more. 

&gt;because we've chatted on here before and you're obviously very smart and nice

I am bloody well not!!! Take that back!!! :-)

It is just that every single time something like this is raised, two topics are consistently spewed out, eugenics and designer babies. And the very vast majority of time, it is by people who have no real understanding of either topic. 

And on that note...

&gt;All I'm saying is that we shouldn't just approve any and all treatments, no matter how exciting they are, without properly discussing the implications.

The problem with that is that so far, discussion is based around what might possibly happen, without actually concentrating on what is happening. What I mean by that is people get caught up in the hypothetical, and therefore hold back the actual research that may or may not lead to the hypothetical. It's like not ever driving in case your car turns into [Christine](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085333/).

true,Sgt_General,,Do it for Redders 4: Never Stop Doing it!,"My story is a long and painful one. Mostly because in terms of team selection and loyalty, I was a complete cunt as a kid. I love football - I've always known that it is a great game - but for a long time I had nothing that gave me a real attachment to it. I was seldom more than a 'neutral' (well, the worst kind of neutral: the glory fan) so I would go through phases where I was fanatical about it and phases where I couldn't care less about it.

It all started when I was young and Kevin Keegan's Newcastle were admired by many, with Alan Shearer leading the line. I thought that they were amazing and couldn't help taking to them - my parents even bought me shares in the club (because apparently that's an appropriate gift for a six-year-old football fan) - although maybe I just liked the familiar barcode style. However, as much as I liked them, I had no real connection to them. St. James' Park seemed like a million miles away. It wasn't love; it was just being an admirer.

However, I grew older and soon realised that popularity in the playground is a wonderful thing. And you're not popular if you're the one being teased because you support a team of losers. So, behaving like a true cunt, I decided to support Manchester United. *[Dramatic thunderclap]* But seriously, just about every boy in my class supported them. It was ridiculous. However, it didn't take me long to realise that they were a team of jammy twats who bullied the referees and media, using mind games and cynical strategies to get ahead. There literally came a time where I thought that I just couldn't support a team like that and around that time I fell out of love with football, only paying attention when England were playing (funnily enough, now it's the exact opposite).

This continued until early 2008, when I started to really fall back in love with football. The trend had started a couple of years earlier, when I got into playing the *Football Manager* games (back when the colour palette was green as a football pitch - I just can't get used to it being white - and I can still remember solving Leeds's debt problem by simply selling Seth Johnson and Eirik Bakke) and my dad, who has always been a Leeds United supporter, started talking to me about news regarding Leeds United and what was happening, perhaps because he was desperate for someone to talk to about it or maybe as part of a cunning plan to foster and interest in Leeds. I'd always known that he was a Leeds fan - if they were on television then he wouldn't let anyone watch anything else on the living room TV, nor would he pay attention to anything else - but he wasn't pushy about making his children Leeds fans as well.

I remember being really emotionally invested in England's failed Euro '08 qualifier (what a cock-up that was) and feeling that I wanted to be this passionate about club football - although hopefully with less heartbreak (spoiler alert: the less heartbreak part was not successful). The turning point really game on a certain Saturday in the 07/08 season, when Leeds were away to Carlisle. Dad knew how important the game was, so he was watching *Soccer Saturday* for the updates while I played *Prince of Persia* on my PC in the adjacent room. Leeds had taken an early lead, but Carlisle were doing all the pressing. Then, suddenly I heard that it was 1-1. I felt deflated for some reason. I kept on waiting, only half concentrating on the game, hoping that Leeds would score. Then I heard it: 2-1 to Carlisle. Why was I feeling despondent when I heard that? Why was I suddenly hoping that Leeds would grab an equaliser? An update at Brunton Park: 3-1 to Carlisle. Fuck.

After that, when I had the time, I found myself wanting to learn more about Leeds and its history, the pride of the Revie years and the resurgence under Wilkinson. I loved the story behind the club: a former giant, it slumbers in the lower leagues waiting to once again stand on football's highest peak. Before long, I was trying to listen to games online, although we didn't have a radio then so I would tune into Yorkshire Radio and only get the end of each half, unless something went wrong with LUTV - which happened often - and they had to broadcast it over Yorkshire Radio after all. Around this point Wise left and results took a nosedive - my dad joked that it had only happened since I started following Leeds! As my interest grew, I realised that I was in touching distance of a personal dream of mine: going to a proper football stadium to watch a game. My dad readily agreed - he had only seen Leeds play once at Elland Road, when they beat Arsenal in the 70's; work and family matters had always got in the way before, but since he had the time to watch *Soccer Saturday* every week, he reasoned that he had time to go to Elland Road instead.

And that was how it started. Gary MacAllister was in charge by this point and the feel-good factor was returning to Leeds. My first game was Leeds 0 Brighton 0, when the prolific duo of Beckford and Freedman inexplicably stopped scoring. But it was a great day. When I first saw the team march onto the pitch, I got a lump in my throat and nearly cried, because I knew I was head over heels in love with this club and I kept thinking about how amazing it would be to have three generations of Leeds fans going to a game in the future (a long way off, mind, for better or for worse). My favourite memory of that match is still seeing Brighton get the ball in the back of the net, only to have it ruled offside, their previously jubilant fans taunted mercilessly by the Leeds faithful.

So **TL;DR:** I had always wanted a football club to follow and love, but never found the right one, prompting me to lose interest in the game (international games aside). Years later, I realised that the right football club had always been under my nose: the very team my dad has always supported. After many years, he finally managed to kindle an interest that has led to a passion I will have for the rest of my life.

true,SlindsayUK,cnty-wales,Wales - Swansea,"A recent post reminded me of the time that the Daily Mail reported on a research project I was peripherally involved in at an old lab. The article was posted in the middle of the night and included some epic inaccuracies that were edited out over the course of the next 8 or so hours but not before some thinly veiled death threats were made in the comments (""these people are your target"" in reference to the pictured researchers) because of it. By noon they had edited the article about 4 times IIRC to remove the borderline slanderous stuff while keeping the article entirely inaccurate.

I just looked back at the article and they seem to have put some of the fundamentally untrue stuff back in there! Some thing in the article that are flat out untrue.

&gt; Families will be rated on how efficiently they recycle by a town hall monitoring office

No they won't. 

&gt; 'They put microchips in the bins ready for pay-as-you-throw bin taxes, and that died a death. I hope councils realise that this sinister idea is taking things too far.'

Council in no way involved in the project 

&gt; Academics at Newcastle University who have pioneered bin-TV say it could be used to 'change the behaviour' of people who refuse to recycle or throw away too much food and packaging.

We didn't say that.

&gt; 'It beggars belief to think that people could be photographed and placed on US-style 'most wanted' lists for putting rubbish in the wrong bin.  Encouraging recycling is fine but publically humiliating those who choose not to is outrageous.

Data not publicly available

&gt; 'Have Newcastle dons really got nothing better to do than waste their time and our tax money on preposterous ideas like this?'

Project not funded by UK money.

Plus almost all of the quotes from the research team are horrifically out of context.

There are some other very clever linguistic tricks employed by the article like:
&gt;But critics of the methods councils have used both to spy on their residents and to enforce their compulsory recycling schemes warned that bin cameras have menacing implications.

This may be true but as the bincam has nothing to do with councils spying on residents why are you getting these peoples quotes?

Perhaps most impressie is the way they have rent-a-quotes provided over night from 2 ""experts"" on the issue but to my knowledge never got in touch with anyone on the research team or responded to us when we tried to point out inaccuracies in the article.

You make an astonishing amount for someone so young (at 23 I had just finished my MA and was making £17.5k) - but you clearly have your head screwed on so kudos for that. 

Be wary of repaying too fast - some (indeed most) mortgages will have a clause about early repayment. Be sure to ask questions about that. 

I also think you need to be wary of the fact you plan on renting out rooms. BTL mortgages are different from personal ones - I would go and sit down with a banker and take advice from them.

I would also be wary of interest rate rises (which may happen soon) - so if you get a variable rate you could end up paying more. I would fix for as long as you can at the current moment. I remortgaged recently at 2.99% for 5 years.

Some other stuff:

Be prepared when you buy a place to see your frugal ways vanish. You'll need to re-do bathrooms and kitchens at some point - furniture will break, you'll need to repaint, most likely you'll need to buy an oven, dishwasher, fridge etc. 

Get a FULL survey done (£1k but worth every penny - we got almost £10k knocked off our place after the survey found problems)

You can live frugally by buying decent things (for example a Miele hoover may cost £££ but will last 15 years) - you can do this as you have such a large income.

If so, it's true, they have been reporting the story with an air of journalistic integrity that should be applauded, even though they are getting to the point where actual ""news"" has slowed to a trickle and they're starting to try to milk blood from a stone. 

In general the other major news outlets have been pretty objective in their treatment of the story so far, too. That will change. HLN and Nancy Grace will sink their teeth into this thing just like they do with every other big murder case with a dramatic plot or an interesting cast of characters. The flagship networks like CNN and MSNBC and even Fox (to an extent) will keep their editorializing in check, but they all own ""light news"" stations that run these sorts of stories to death. I already mentioned HLN, which is under CNN and used to be kind've a hard news ticker channel that ran briefs on major stories all day, it was frequently the default station in airports and restaurants, etc. In the past couple years, it has become a scummy outlet for tabloid non-news targeted at idiots. Each of the major broadcasters owns at least one station like this, and they will have free reign to do whatever they want with the Hernandez story. 

The main difference between the US and Britain is that, for whatever reason, most of the major news outlets are actually just glorified tabloids from the top down. I don't live there, so I don't know when this happened. Some of my UK friends would just say that the lowest-common-denominator represents a larger segment of the population over there than it does in the US (I do not agree or disagree, but I have several friends who live there and they have all said they believe this to be the case), so the media just sank down to that level to turn a better profit. There are some outlets with decent standards (Sky, BBC, et al.), but most of the other major representatives (Mirror, Sun, Daily Mail, etc.) have sold out entirely to sensationalist, editorializing, divisive pitchfork journalism. They railroad Luis for the same reason they make front page news out of some Reality TV celeb's extramarital affair: it gets the attention of idiots.

Suarez's offences have been on the field, and are comparatively trivial: a bite that didn't break the skin; an argument in which both players used language that could be considered racist. The bite, the World Cup handball and the alleged diving all took place on TV. They're not criminal cases, they're just opportunities for journos to exercise their moralistic pomposity.

And it's not just the media that lose their shit over Suarez.

For perspective, the Doctor was between 200 and 240 or so when he stole the TARDIS, had his first regeneration at about 450, and his second at 750.

The issue arises later when the 8th Doctor places his age over 1000, and then the 9th says he's got 900 years of travel in the 'blue box'...but 10 and 11 seem consistent in their description of their ages, which start with 10 claiming to be just over 900.

Steven Moffat has explained this away by suggesting that The Doctor simply doesn't know how old he is. How could he, unless he was 'marking it on the walls'.

Another fan suggestion has often been that he (at different times) was using Earth and Gallifreyan years...which would almost certainly not be equal (and given the nature of Gallifreyan Time Lords, their 'time' could be purely subjective, or completely removed from the 'normal' linear time we experience).

All that matters is cost-analysis benefits. If it can be shown that using herbs in this way gets significant medical and economic benefits then it is exactly what a publicly funded system should be.

&gt;If a lossily compressed result is perceptually indistinguishable from the uncompressed input, then the compression can be declared to be transparent. **In other words, transparency is the situation where artifacts are nonexistant or imperceptible.**

&gt;**MP3-encoded files are generally considered artifact-free at bitrates at/above 192kbps.**

Even if you have sensitive enough ears and have had a lot of experience with ato detect 192kbps CBR 320kbps is far above the the threshold of transparency for MP3, so it too is transparent.

As for your personal anecdotes, I would redirect you to this part of the article:

&gt;Judging transparency can be difficult due to observation bias, in which subjective like/dislike of a certain compression methodology emotionally influences his/her judgment. This bias is commonly referred to as placebo, although this use is slightly different from the medical use of the term. 

If that isn't enough for you, how about this, [from wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_%28data_compression%29):

&gt;the transparency threshold for MP3 to Linear PCM audio is said to be around 192 kbit/s 44.1 kHz MP3.^[citation ^needed] This means that **when MP3 is playing back at 192 kbit/s 44.1 kHz, it is indistinguishable from the original PCM**, and transparent to compression.",0,1372432139,null,0,1372432661,0,carzz5m,t3_1h649q,t1_carzz5m,t1_carx04c,null,1430652854,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

If something is proven to work, we should be using it.  But in a safe manner.  
Less potent medicines can be prescribed by a nurse, or a pharmacist, reducing the use of doctors, this applies equally to medicines originating from herbs.

Even if we are treating people with herbal extracts (which we do already), they are delivered in measurable doses, rather then number of bags in the teapot.

So we are ironically at a place where your need for it to look a certain way is overriding what is most clinically beneficial.

However it is important to note that the herbs in question may have rather small medical benefits on their own. We are interested in a good candidate for cheap placebos that can be augmented by setting, intention and ritual.

Also, and this will answer the final point, people can't just turn up and claim benefits. In fact they can't just turn up at all. Non-EU residents are subject the standard immigration rules which heavily favours those with useful skills, only allows people in who have a decent grasp of English and as far as I can tell [you must be resident in the UK to receive any benefits.](http://www.nhs.uk/CarersDirect/moneyandlegal/otherbenefits/Pages/benefits-immigration-residence.aspx) 

While the rules are more relaxed for EU citizens (just like they are relaxed for UK citizens wanting to travel to other European countries) there are many benefits which you cannot get in Europe. Income support which is often the largest benefit available is not available for example. I broadly agree with you on this however and in you are leaving the EU you should not expect to continue benefits except pensions and anything else you are already entitled to. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect a small jobseekers allowance while you spend 24/7 looking for work in the EU.

If you don’t want to use it to buy a house/flat then it depends on your time scales. If you’re looking at this as a investment for your long-term future, then you might as well chuck it into shares.

That strikes me as weak mental strength, meaning however good he can be he's going to find it harder to reach his full potential.

Technique, decision making, movement can all be worked on and improved through training. However, is it really possible to change someone's natural mentality? Take for example Suarez's biting - it's an innate reaction, a reflex if you will. I'm not saying Shelvey is a borderline psychopath like Balotelli or furiously passionate like Suarez but he definitely doesn't handle pressure well on the highest stage. He might habituate the the prem, but say we got into the CL next season - would he be able to step up to the the new challenge? Is he a player you could rely on in a cup final? I don't think so.

There's no ""correct"" order, though. They've never had a chronological timeline to follow. 

*Genesis of the Daleks* is a real fan-favorite, but almost everyone agrees that it would have been better if it was a bit shorter--there are certainly some draggy parts to it.  You should watch it, though.

true,WheresMyDragons,swans2002,Swansea Born &amp; Bred,"Okay, here's my take on it all.

1.  The home shirt does nothing for me right now, but that could be because of the high expectations following last years kit.  Given time, I'm sure once we start playing in it I'll grow to like it and will probably even buy it at some point.

2. I love the away shirt, but I dislike the yellow shorts.  In my opinion, I think the whole kit would have looked better with purple shorts with yellow stripes, but that's just my take on it.  Again, I'm sure it will grow on my once I see us in it more.

3. I'm a little surprised/underwhelmed at the new sponsor. First reason being it's not the kind of household name that maybe I was a little eager in anticipating, and the second reason being 2M sounds a little low as a sponsorship price.  However if it's only a one year deal, I am willing to trust the board and see how well this deal fairs us before making too harsh a judgement.
4. To mention to sponsorship just a little more, I understand that 30% of Premier League revenue is to be found in the Asian market, I just wonder how much of that slice this company can bring us?  But like I said, I will hold judgement until I see for myself.
5.  Okay, last time I mention the sponsorship.  From what I've read so far, Koreans don't seem to pleased with having a Chinese sponsor on the shirts.  Will we find our sales and fan base decreasing there?  Or will we see sales continue to grow due to our success?",0,1372439808,null,0,false,0,cas2upd,t3_1h8lgy,t1_cas2upd,t3_1h8lgy,null,1430651427,2,false,swanseacity,t5_2tip4,2

Obviously Hugo between the pipes, with Friedel filling in for cup/non-EPL fixtures.
Back 4 of Walker, Kaboul, Vertonghen, and maybe BAE unless we shop him. Naughton and Caulker as cover, not gonna speculate on our youth or possible transfer purchases.
Now, the tricky bit, what to do with our loads of talent in the midfield. In my mind, I see a 3 man ""triangle"" of Sandro, Dembele, Paulinho. Sandro and Dembele can play as purely DM's (Sandro even more so) and allow cover for Paulinho to move the ball forward, as well as let our CB/Wings have a run upfield. Dembele and Paulinho can even trade roles, dropping back and going forward as necessary. 
The front 3 would be Bale/Lennon on the wings, with a striker, Adebayor (or Villa) up front.

Siggy, Holtby, and Dempsey can come in and play several roles, either as wings (giving Lennon a break), or occupying that front CM role filled by Paulinho/Dembele. We can also alter our formations as necessary to accommodate all the talent we have.

The offices of all the researchers, lecturers etc. are located on the Silver Street (next to Queens') and the only thing they have is a small computer room in the basement. I think they still use the Mill Lane library (although I know that the Development guys got moved to Marshall [Economics library]), which is just round the corner. The lecture rooms are in the same building as the library and I guess they are a bit more decent compared to those used by the Economics faculty.

Economics Faculty, on the other hand, is on the Sidgwick site (on the other side of the river) and it has a library (Marshall Library of Economics), all the offices of academics and administrative staff, a few computer rooms and a small buttery all in one place.

To be honest, I feel as if there's little point looking round the facilities - they are rather shabby (which applies to quite a few departments in Cambridge, especially in social sciences and humanities). I'd rather try attending some events run by the respective faculties in order to get a better feeling of what potentially you would be taught and what sort of people work there.

The City of London does not own nations it owns corporations. It has made each nation into a corporation to be controlled under Admiralty Law and the later Uniform Commercial Code started in 1933.

**EDIT:** Better translation of the article -

1) LFC has reached an agreement on HM's transfer from Shakhtar. The official announcement will be made in the coming days.

2) at the moment he is in his home city Yerevan, but will fly to Liverpool to join his new team in a few days.

3) the news have been broken during the Friday football show on Armenian TV, though the name of the club wasn't mentioned..

4) the amount of transfer fee will make about €30m. clubls like Juve, City, Chelsea, Atletico, Zenit &amp; Anzhi were interested too

Jenny is played by Georgia Moffett, the daughter of Peter Davidson, who played the fifth doctor. She played Jenny opposite David Tennant, whom she then ended up marrying and having a female child with. Further, she actually went to school with Tom Baker's daughter. 

So: the Doctor's daughter (who went to school with the Doctor's daughter) who played the Doctor's daughter in ""The Doctor's Daughter"" married the Doctor and gave birth to the Doctor's Daughter (who is technically also the Doctor's Granddaughter.)

There's a video somewhere of Georgia asking her who her favourite doctor is, and she says like ""Tom Baker"" and then when asked for her second favorite she says ""David Tennant"" and Georgia says ""Better not tell grandpa about this one"" or something.

Opening shot of London is Sherlock. (from what I can tell)

Most likely, for the hallway shot, they filmed their own. David Tennant Body Double.

For the two shot, they took a mix of their own footage (David Tennant's/Matt Smith's shoulders) and previous episode footage (Matt Smith saying ""Hello again.""/David Tennant looking around) and layered the two on top of a still image background. Footage for David Tennant comes from *The End of Time Pt. 1* as pointed out by [ProtoKun7](http://www.reddit.com/u/ProtoKun7) in [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1h67f8/found_this_man_it_looks_real_cant_wait/car83z5).

Shot combined from behind the scenes of the 50th [which can be seen here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILmoQMUFdUs), [HERE (around 0:29)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dClJGTSxsI), and [HERE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldULqpPV45Y), a CGI Helicopter, and some superimposed images of landmarks in Trafalgar square.

Can't identify the Knight and the tent.

John Hurt from a previous movie, most likely.

David Tennant stares out at the destruction. Rotoscoped from another episode on top of a plate animation with smoke/destruction that was made in studio. (or, at least that's my guess)

Matt Smith's face CG'ed onto a body double in front of a keyed plate. You can tell from the outfit. No cashmere jacket. Bowtie is black, no texture. No pocketwatch.

TARDIS 3D model interior with After Effects applied for explosions.

Cut to faraway shot of Clara body double.

Cut to footage that I can't identify. (Hand reaching through frame. Looks cool, unsure of whether it was premade, or made from scratch.)

Rose body double behind crack in fence.

Fire Plate with TARDIS front super imposed and more fire effects on top of it.

Matt Smith CG'ed(?) onto body double face again, scene relighting to make the eyelights show and the face light change.

All in all, it's amazingly well made, especially for being fanmade.

If other top top clubs are willing to meet the valuation as well, then there must be some merit to it. He is not an unknown player, he is probably the best player in the best ukranian team in many years. Man city just bought Fernandinho for £30m from Shaktar. Shaktar made it out of a champions league group with Juve and Chelsea this past season as well. Just because YOU don't know who he is, does not mean he is an unknown player. I'd much rather spend 20m on a great player than purchase more squad players like Borini and Allen for 10-15m. We have enough depth now (besides defense) with our most recent signings. We need a couple top quality players right NOW, not players who have potential yet are not good enough at the moment. If the players we signed dont meet their potential, we will always be in the ""in a couple years we will have a really great team."" mentality. It's a lose-lose for the club.

true,Cael87,null,null,"It's all about under-steer vs. over-steer for cornering. In a Front wheel drive or 4WD/AWD the front wheels lose traction under the added power load and the front end slides out away from the corner. (this is called under-steer as the car seems to suddenly not be able to turn at the same rate, it can cause you to run off the road easily if you are pushing the car near its limits).  In a RWD the back end can do the same and push out (known as over-steer as the front end is turned into the corner more and you end up going toward the inside of the track instead of sliding toward the outside).

The main reason why over-steer is preferred to under-steer is that you can whip the wheel back a little bit off a turn to correct over-steer, with under-steer you have lost traction with your front wheels, you can only mash on the brakes and hope for the best.... and even if you got back traction, you can't turn the wheel further to the side you're already cranking it to max on.

But additionally, the rear is less likely to lose traction since it is only pushing and not pushing/turning at the same time.  Motorbikes are different because of their weight distribution and ability to lean into a turn, it's a whole different set of physics.

As for on take-off I'm not to sure why RWD fares better at actually getting off the line. I know that the burn-out of taking off from a dead stop can cause the front wheels to be turned abruptly on their own by one tire getting more traction than the other, in the back it's not a noticable and is unable to physically turn the wheel so they just spin like always... I just know that RWDs have a much easier time getting off the line than 4WD/AWD.

Usually a MR car is considered best (Mid-engined, Rear wheel drive) and the Jag has the engine in the right spot, mid-mounted (Personally, I've always been a fan of RR cars - Rear engined, Rear wheel drive - because of the uncanny ability the have with their balance to maintain a turn at a faster pace... but I'm in the minority).

4WD/AWD is used a lot more in expensive supercars nowadays because it is about as easy to control as a Front wheel drive, and yet can provide more similar performance to the rear wheel drive cars.  Companies don't want their rich customers who can't drive to die the first time they try to go a bit too fast for themselves, and if you start to lose traction in a RWD car around a bend and mash the brakes, you'll be spinning and unable to control the car at all.  In a 4WD car you won't spin, making it much safer to give to someone who might not react in the exact right way.

&gt; How many drivers go past you in a week? Now... Using your numbers, 1 in that many drivers are cunts.

I can't quite understand this sentence but I have a rough idea. It's an interesting question that I want an answer to. In the name of science I purchased a helmet cam. If I ever get the time I want to go through the footage and evaluate the passes. The first short test video I did of about ten instances found only 20% overtaking as the highway code demands, two were dangerously close and one of those was on a mobile phone.

There are certain roads and situations that drivers in general seem to be able to handle which shows an empathy deficit if not willful disregard for a vulnerable minority, which is not unlike racism. Oncoming traffic, narrow roads, two cyclists passing each other in opposite directions, needing to overtake parked cars.

I just looked through my latest commute. 5 miles of travel along A roads and these were the over takes:

* Good 4
* Bad  1
* Ugly 3
    * 1 tailgate deliberate close pass (1m from back wheel, 20 cm from arm)
    * 1 tailgate deliberate punishment close pass with wanker gesture (same tolerances)
    * 1 tailgate close pass while I'm travelling 27mph, breaks double white line before a blind bend.

* Bonus: 1/2 ASL blocked (that's the green strip at lights supposedly just for bikes), 0m of cycle lane, 1 red light jumping car driver, 300 metres of pavement parking turning a two lane road into a one lane.

Townsend should absolutely be brought back into the first-team fold, that or given a loan to a good team. I don't think a Championship team would be right, given the quality he produced for a failing QPR side last season. I've said this about Carroll and I'll say it about more of our promising youngsters, but a side like Swansea that plays good possession and attacking football would be prime. It is, however, unlikely.
edit: Forgot to discuss Livermore. I'll be brief...sell him.

If we cannot offer our youth quality first-team football in Lilywhite, then they absolutely must be sent somewhere where they will. Development within the club will save us money down the line in terms of transfer fees and hell, if we produce a starlet who does not want to continue on the fringes of our first team then maybe we can turn a profit on selling them.

Because the PL is a bigger league than the Dutch league.  It's a bigger league than the Turkish league as well.  Players leave CL teams from smaller leagues all the time to move to bigger leagues, and they don't always go to CL teams.  For players all over the globe the Premier League is the dream league, the stage on which they want to be playing even more than the Champions League - after all, if you're from one of the smaller leagues, fame derived from the Champions League is ephemeral.  If you play in one of the biggest leagues you're a household name all over the globe.

My view is that you can completely justify what Bletchley Park did in World War Two. By all means restore the site/buildings and celebrate what was achieved. They were attempting to use any means at their disposal to defend the nation from Nazi Germany. The same can be said of any nation that took part in World War Two. Britain just happened to be particularly good at spying, code breaking and subterfuge (the Germans were pretty amazing themselves). 

The question today is can you justify their modern counterparts at GCHQ? Is it even in the same ballpark of spying and subterfuge? 

My own opinion is that when you enter the realm of the civilian you're entering murky ethical territory. Much like how the accidental bombing of civilian areas began the bombing campaign on British cities instead of military airfields (which was a tactical military mistake). Bomb military outposts all you like. Start bombing civilians and suddenly you've moved the goalposts. This lead to the bombing of Berlin and Dresden by the British in retaliation. 

In 2013, instead of bombs from planes we have 24/7 monitoring of digital activity. We're edging into the 'thought crime' and predictive crime of Orwell's 1984 and the Minority Report short story/film. Is this for the better?

I freely admitted he dug his own hole.  I said it directly, that he caused his own problems through his actions.  I also point out that the public and media witch hunt against him is over the top and a bit of nonsense at this point.  The way they blow his every breath and movement out of proportion is just outrageous.

He clearly wants to leave England, it isn't so much as leaving the club as leaving a bad situation in the public and media spectrum.  He has to leave the club to get away from that.  I don't know if you can understand/read Spanish, but if you can and you watch his interviews where he was talking about Real, it's clear that he loves and respects the club.  He knows he made mistakes and he also knows he needs to get away from the horrible circumstance he's made.  If you were in his shoes, I bet you'd want to get your family away from the people who harass you and them constantly (regardless of why they're doing it).  I know I'd put my family first, and if I had to swallow my pride to do so, I would.

I also agree with the original post about him looking like a fool now.

So basically, I agree with everything you said, then point out that he's a human being and he makes mistakes.  Wanting away from the toxic situation he's in is understandable.

Oh, and at no point did anyone ever say anything was or was not the club's fault, so I have no idea why that's there.

Maybe next time instead of making some sarcastic remark sounding like a twat for no reason, make a constructive post to stimulate and contribute to the discussion.

Also note that I have not downvoted you.  I probably should have, but I didn't.

Our formation would most essentially shift to a 4-2-3-1 in attack as Dembele or Paulinho make runs forward.

true,szlafarski,lfc99,,"Honestly, I know this is probably risqué, but hear me out.

Eriksen is a good player. He controls games, goes box to box, is a solid passer, good dribbler and has solid vision. He's also good around the box.

Every criticism of him seems to be this: he's not the strongest physically. He could also use more skill and confidence in his tackling and could benefit from putting in a little more steam into the match. He also doesn't show the same level of leadership from other midfielders in the league like Strootman, De Jong, Fer and Maher.

When people talk about the player he could become, I see a more confident, polished Jordan Henderson. 

Eriksen has been playing the same role for years now, whereas Henderson went from playing as  right midfielder in a long-ball Steve Bruce squad, to playing right midfield, left wing, right back and in a 10 role under Dalglish, only to be completely remolded into an incredibly reliable player under Rodgers. 

Eriksen is a big fish in a very small pond. Hendo is a warrior on a battlefield. You can see it in his eyes - the frustration, the focus, and the determination. When it comes to one of them becoming more like the other, I believe Henderson will come out on top as the man we need.

Henrikh is a lethal attacking threat who also plays as a deep lying playmaker and works almost as hard as Kuyt and Borini. An attacker with defensive prowess and a strong, quick brain. Almost like Frank Lampard back in the day.

When I look to the future, the idea of  having a midfield selection of Henrikh, Hendo, Allen, Lucas and Coutinho to me looks brilliant and has more depth than one with Eriksen instead of the Armenian man.

The BBC are the governing body of the show.  In the absence of a Gene Roddenberry like creator the rule of thumb for Doctor Who has, for a long time, been that it's up to the individual fan to decided whatever they want to be canon.

I agree with what you are stating as what one should consider Doctor Who canon completely.

But there are many fans who include the novels, Big Finish audio books, etc part of Doctor Who canon and you cannot rightly call them wrong because, unlike the Star Wars expanded universe, no producing authority on the show has ever said they are not.

Also, I think you're putting a little too much stock into the concept of this ""common practice"".  How many genre television shows are there in which the concept of ""what is canon?"" is even an issue?

And no, I wouldn't count Buffy or any show with a singular creator either because those DO have a Roddenberry-esque character to deem what is and what is not.

My bad. Not from Sherlock. Still doesn't mean it's not pre-shot stock footage/footage from another show.

true,Murray92,null,null,"I'm not disabled so maybe there are things I've missed but I believe that generally the UK is pretty top-notch in catering for disabled people. 

Almost everywhere built in the last 30 years has a disabled toilet with grab rails. Train staff are always helping people with wheelchair ramps on and off and I'm sure will help you if you need it, just give the staff nearby some warning. All train stations have lifts or ramps, I think most but not all London Underground stations do. Most buses and hackney cabs are easy access (they lower themselves when people get in so the step up isn't as big).

If you're visiting cities then almost everywhere should be accessible, not so much in the countryside where the buildings are older and haven't been built in a time with the disabled in mind. If in doubt try to go with a big hotel company.

Really old tourist attractions (York Cathedral, for example) won't have lifts to the difficult parts but will have ramps outside to let you into some of the attraction at least.

Travelling alone should be fine, if you do ever need any help most people are friendly enough to do so. Make sure to ask for help if you need it, us Brits are sometimes shy to offer but even more shy to refuse.

true,magrimesy,,That American Leeds fan,"I have a pretty good story.

Unlike a lot of American kids, I grew up playing football. This was also in an area that was mainly dominated by American football and basketball, so the leagues were rather small.

During my second summer camp, my family acted as hosts for two coaches who came over from England. One of them was from Leeds and talked to me about the different atmosphere football had in Europe compared to America. Of course, I was only 7 at the time so I didn't really understand, but he first introduced me to Leeds.

I had no way to follow Leeds though, as the internet was definitely not up to the level it is today and US television NEVER covered any form of soccer in the 90's besides WC. Eventually, I was able to start finding reports of scores and rosters. Streaming evolved sometime later and networks like ESPN finally began to realize that footy brings in viewers.

I went to my first live Leeds matches this past winter (Blackpool and Blackburn in Feb.) thanks to my friend, the one who introduced me to Leeds over 15 years ago. He is like my brother and I can't thank him enough for exposing me to British football and to Leeds United.

**TL;DR** American who got introduced to LUFC as a kid, finally got to a live match 15 years later. ",0,1372481072,null,0,false,0,casgw17,t3_1h8n56,t1_casgw17,t3_1h8n56,null,1430644742,4,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,4

The Massacre and The Romans make it pretty clear that he's not a Christian. He's quite friendly with Buddhists in The Abominable Snowman and Planet of the Spiders, but clearly isn't a follower.  When he met vampires in State of Decay he didn't splash it with Holy Water, he dropped a space-ship on it. He had a nice conversation with Charles Darwin in Bloodtide.

The Doctor repeats the name of his companions, that's what he believes in: people. 

Also, while most people believe that ""cross my heart"" comes from Christianity, there's no real proof that it is and a few good arguments that it isn't: it's the wrong cross (diagonal rather than Greek), ""crossing yourself"" exists as a separate gesture, and ""cross my heart and hope to die"" has no links to Christian myth - it's more like the kind of curse-marks you'd see in Roman Mystery cults.

I feel as if the agents are leaking information here and there to drive up the price on Mkhitaryan. I'm sure this happens a lot. And I think a similar thing is happening with Suarez as well. While the comments from Suarez have not been ideal (to put it mildly), perhaps Real Madrid are using that to create a false interest in Suarez to drive down the prices of other players they are pursuing.

I try my best not to get too caught up with a transfer rumor one way or another.

What we do know about Mkhitaryan is that he very likely being pursued by us and by other clubs. And we'll just have to see how it all shakes out.

I might just be sheltered - I live in an area in the South of England where there's (thankfully :) ) very little racism, but I barely feel like my friends and I would notice a Doctor's skin colour. I certainly don't think it would be something that would stop people watching the show, I feel like it would be a talking point at most.

I agree with Rm860 that a new Doctor would have to be a good actor to be accepted, but I don't feel like that's so intrinsically linked with the race of the Doctor - aside from how big or small an issue race would be, people get so attached to their doctors anyway that a sub-par Doctor is almost never accepted. They always have to be phenomenal actors to live up to the standards of our fond memories of the last one - I think that the idea of a new hero is always a massive risk the show takes, even if they're very adept at pulling it off, and I think that outweighs the risk of changing his race by a long way.",0,1372487884,null,0,false,0,casiizv,t3_1h98yh,t1_casiizv,t1_casc1by,null,1430643899,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Doing my best to answer your question, for starters, the incarnation of The Doctor doesn't really matter. Whether he's in his first or final body, it's all still the same Doctor, and all still the same timeline. The 3rd Doctor running into the 5th Doctor is just as much a paradox as 11 running into 11. That's because 'The 5th Doctor' and 'The 3rd Doctor' are just arbitrary titles fans have given them to differentiate between actors, but as I said, it's still the same guy.

As for every moment of every place in history would be a tad impossible, even for The Doctor. Even within one square foot of space, there's billions upon billions of moments within that small space, and now multiply that by the billions upon billions of locations in the universe. While The Doctor has ran into himself in the past, the chances of doing so would regardless would be astronomical more than a statistical certainty.

Finally, as for The Doctor crossing his own timeline, as I've said it has happened. It largely turns into the Doctor amusingly bickering with himself.",0,1372488216,null,0,false,0,casilcw,t3_1haqf6,t1_casilcw,t3_1haqf6,null,1430643869,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

&gt;* How about temporarily stopping further immigration whilst we do sort out the housing issues.

&gt;* If you import too many people you run out of places to put them. Actually you don't. You simply displace the indigenous population

&gt;* It is another case of EU policy trumping our own. 

&gt;* Every body thinks houses are over priced, any one stop to think that maybe thats not the problem perhaps, were underpaid?

&gt;* I choose to have two homes because I can afford it and I wish to spend my money that way.  I could spend my cash down the pub or on the horses or on extra TVs and TV subscriptions and junk food.  Instead I have decided to own two homes, for my convenience.
Also I do not see a shortage.  There seems to be a lot of houses on the market to me.  Just have a look at the estate agents windows.  Whether you can afford one is up to you.

&gt;* The problem is all the imported labour voters.

&gt;* It is possible to get a mortgage for this amount for around 275 quid right now per month. 
Contrast this with an iPhone 5 contract and a iPad Mini. You can get these on a contract for around 80 quid a month. Then chuck in a few apps and data use and, hey presto - you are paying 100 quid a month. Now, lets add some SKY sports and the extra's - and keep it low- say 50 quid.

&gt;* funny old world, when i drive round London I see lots of Muslims not working having loads of children, whilst living in houses paid for by people, who although working are living in worse accommodation than the non-working muslims.

I've solved the problems with housing - it's the EU, immigrants (specifically muslims), and lazy people who won't save. ~",0,1372489218,null,0,1372489651,0,casisgc,t3_1hapz7,t1_casisgc,t1_cashqop,null,1430643776,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

Taking them away creates the possibility of them dying elsewhere, or just never returning, which would be a paradox. There's also a ton of temporal energy revolving around them because they created such a huge paradox in the first place by having Amy and Rory die to save Rory. Their timeline has already become a strain on time as it is.

I guess a good analogy is the glass analogy The Doctor used in Doomsday. Think of time as the glass, and Amy and Rory caused some serious cracking by creating a paradox in which Rory dies before he can die of old age in the hotel. Messing with their lives even more, and introducing more opportunities for paradoxes to form, will only push the glass to its breaking point.

And I don't think we've ever seen The Doctor save someone after an Angel took them. We didn't see that in Blink whatsoever, Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone didn't have the Angels transport people through time/space, and in Angels Take Manhattan we see the only reason why The Doctor is even able to follow Rory is through the help of River Song being in the same time period, and even then the TARDIS barely makes it.",0,1372489255,null,0,false,0,casispu,t3_1hargq,t1_casispu,t3_1hargq,null,1430643772,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

There are accessible toilets with grab-rails everywhere, though most require a special ""RADAR"" key - you can buy one online, but a lot of places will lend you one to use for their toilet if you ask.

Most places will have handrails on the stairs, apart from castle ruins and things like that! A lot of places will have lifts (elevators) anyway though.

I'm not sure about going solo - it depends on your individual disability I guess. For getting around, you should avoid places like the London Underground as it can be a nightmare accessibility-wise - very crowded and many stations are old and don't have lifts. Most stations have escalators though. In most regular train stations you can phone through and book free assistance if you need it for getting on and off the train, but pretty much all have lifts. Buses should be fine - many have low steps to get on, and they can usually fold a ramp out if you need one.

Within weeks, the plan was in tatters, thwarted by the West and its leader, Abdul Haq, assassinated by the Taliban. Lucy Morgan Edwards's investigation into Haq's tragic mission led her to Taliban Ministers, warlords, spies, and two American Republican brothers who financed Haq's venture.

&gt;the U.S. chose to force regime change from without while marginalizing Haq, who still valiantly tried to activate his plan on October 26, 2001 but was assassinated by the Taliban (although local sources claim his executioners were tipped off by certain foreign intelligence agencies). A decade later, it has become quite clear why Haq's solution was -- and still is -- the only solution.

Quite simply:

* cost of living - income from job = profit

If you think it is worth living in London because of the big income you get then you can justify the rent.

If you think London is a fucking rip off then move somewhere else where you can save a few pounds in your pocket.

Really quite simple. All this bitching is because lazy renters can't get off their ass and better themselves and their situation. Since when should landlords *not* try and make as much as they can? They have to deal with the losses if nobody wants to rent. Councils are not forgiving and charge council tax on occupied properties now: so landlords all over the country are frightened if they can't get somebody in within 4 weeks. Sometimes you have it good, sometimes you have it bad, that's called taking a risk and part of entrepreneurial life. As a renter you don't take that risk.
