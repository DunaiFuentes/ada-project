Imagine if you give 8 employees a 10-minute ""it's okay if you're late"" lee-way every working day.

I've only really played S.A, but from what I remember:

* The only places you can possibly eat are fast food diners.
* The radio adverts are nearly all over sexualised and full of hyperbole.
* The cops are all assholes, and are always corrupt enough to release you if you pay up.
* It's perfectly fine to open carry any firearm anywhere.
* The gun shop adverts perfectly satirise the perceived American gun fetish.
* The only women who have any gameplay significance at all are prostitutes.
* Everything, and everyone, is larger than life. The characters are brash, the stunts are crazy, you can get squads of tanks chasing down a single individual.

That kind of thing wouldn't really work in London, because London isn't in everyone's face in the same way that American culture is, all the time, in movies, music, games, TV (I guess you could call it ‘Californication’).

He's been compared to Lampard but I think he probably has a better awareness defensively than Lampard did at that age.

I think Salmond's response would be that independence for Scotland would be beneficial to the rest of the UK.

By far the biggest problem with UK politics is inertia - things are done a particular way because that's how they've always been done. It would be nice if the UK elected a leader that would address some of the issues you raise but the evidence is that the last 50 years worth of Prime Ministers seem quite happy with the status quo.

How likely do you think it is that the problem of the UK's London-centric political system would ever be addressed by any politicians operating within that system? Thatcher and Blair are both textbook examples of how a politician can become entranced by being in the centre of power - particularly on the international stage.

So three songs are picked before kick off and played back to back before YNWA and then another two during half time. Suarez was on the pitch at half time warming up and one of the songs playing was Depeche Mode's can't get enough, it just basically stuck from there. What helped matters was that when Suarez was subbed on, he scored within 12 minutes IIRC and the song just caught on in the Kop, though at the time it was just the tune (do-do-do do- do - do LUIS SUAREZ... repeat ad infinitum).",0,1379453701,null,0,false,0,ccad5f3,t3_1ml1ob,t1_ccad5f3,t1_ccac8u2,null,1429429138,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

The EU have offered no official viewpoint. The EC have offered to provide this viewpoint to the current member state (the UK), however the UK have explicitly [refused to request it](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/12/18/scottish-independence-mic_n_2324048.html). Despite representing Scotland's interests in Europe, the UK government feels that to take up this advice would be to ""pre-negotiate"".

Several EC commissioners have offered their personal opinion, but ultimately their personal opinions (pro or not) are simply their personal opinions.


&gt; and they might not offer membership because the don't want to send the message to the rest of Europe that breaking off from your country is acceptable, especially given that Scotland, Catalonia and probably a couple of other smaller places are trying to separate from their parent governments right now.

The root of Spain's objections to Catalonia lie in the Spanish constitution - this explicitly refers to the ""indivisible unity"" of Spain, the context being their civil war. As such the Spanish government think what Catalonia is proposing is quite literally unconstitutional.

The [Edinburgh Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Agreement_\(2012\)) commits both Scottish and UK governments to honouring the result of the referendum. Even Spain have stated that they would have [no objections](http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/spain-will-not-object-to-an-independent-scotland-1117842) to a negotiated settlement.

The reality is that Scotland will not leave the UK before it joins the EU; both events would be arranged for the same day, and both would take place some time after the referendum - the referendum is simply to decide if Scotland should become independent, not when.

There are these problems across the UK and many people have been trying to change them for years, only to have their votes outweighed by the votes of those from affluent areas. It's less that the Scots are fucking off to do their own thing rather than trying to fix the UK, and more that they're tired of not having any effect - Scotland has voted ""more left"" (Labour instead of Tories usually, but consistently further left) than England for the past 40 years, but are still outweighed by the South East.

If the politicians had actually worked towards fixing the issues that Scotland (and most other less wealthy areas) have faced, since the last referendum, then this referendum probably wouldn't be happy.

Also, people voting for independence aren't voting for Alex Salmond. There is no party allegiance and voting for independence doesn't even mean that they agree with the Yes Scotland party, let alone the SNP, it literally just means they are voting for independence. Alex Salmond could easily not become the national leader after independence, as it would depend on another vote.

I think this is misunderstanding the debate to be honest - independence for Scotland is about choosing a different direction than rUK, not some sub-Braveheart flag waving. Take two of the issues you mentioned - Syria and the EU.

Syria is, like Libya, an issue where the UK appears to be getting involved to win favour with the US. If the US becomes engaged in a conflict with Iran in the next decade, I have absolutely no doubt that the UK would be involved - and no doubt that an independent Scotland would not.

Similarly with the EU. Cameron has proposed an in-or-out referendum on EU membership; the Conservative party have a long and difficult history with the EU, whereas an independent Scotland would probably pursue a much more ""normal"" relationship.

It's worth remembering that the referendum is simply to decide if Scotland should become independent - independence itself would happen some time later. The day after the vote Scotland would still be within the EU, and so it is quite right to say that we would be ""negotiating from within"".

The main delay in EU accession is adjusting local legal systems to be compliant with EU law. Scotland has already done that process, as part of the UK (EU legislation is transposed twice in the UK; once into English Law and once into Scots Law).

I don't see any practical way that Scotland could be moved temporarily outside the EU (our populations and businesses are simply too intermixed nowadays), nor any advantage to having us outside permanently (large areas of the EU fishing zones fall within Scottish waters).

Although it's true that there is no precedent, there was also no precedent for German unification. Thatcher and Mitterrand were both deeply opposed to that project but once the vote was taken the process was [pretty straightforward](http://www.euractiv.com/future-eu/eu-negotiator-main-difficulty-ge-interview-498395).

This [BBC source](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-20042070) says so far 40bn barrels have been extracted, earning the government around £300bn, 90% of which was from what might become Scottish waters, and that somewhere between 15bn and 24bn barrels are left. Using these numbers a very rough calculation gives somewhere between £112bn and £180bn.  Assuming Scotland get 90% then it should be worth somewhere between £101bn and 162bn.

[Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sea_oil) suggests at least 76% has been extracted but agrees on the remaining amount. This would imply the remaining value is &lt;= £76bn, of which &lt;=£64.8bn would go to Scotland.

This [source](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/0041/00416072.pdf) suggests that by 2018 the value to the government should be between £35bn and £57bn, but doesn't suggest how much would be left after this. My best guess is the paper assumes around 4.5bn barrels used in this time, and so around £116bn to £304bn. Again giving 90% of this to Scotland would give something between £105bn and £273bn.

**TLDR;**
A value of around £140bn for the north sea oil seams reasonable, though there is a large variation surrounding this figure. To put this in perspective UK debt is around £1.4tn, so if Scotland got a per capita share (about 8%)  this would come to £112bn.",0,1379460188,null,0,false,0,ccafb0l,t3_1mktag,t1_ccafb0l,t1_ccabwlg,null,1429428133,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

The logos are only a recent thing as far as I know, prior to the 90s they were hand designed and now the clubs all want the images simplified and vectorised to make use of in digital media.

I think there's much less appetite for withdrawing from the EU in Scotland. If anything, the No campaign have been repeatedly stating that voting Yes might lead to Scotland finding itself out of the EU and having to re-apply from scratch.

I've no problem whatsoever with the UK having a referendum over it, although I think outside of the Conservatives/UKIP the desire is pretty minimal (for example, neither Labour nor the Lib Dems have said they're in favour of it).

Oil production is not just about how much of it there physically is - it's also about the cost to extract it. Should oil double in price (for example) all sorts of previously ignored fields - as well as ones currently deemed economically unprofitable - would begin production again, although admittedly within the constraints of how much oil there actually is. The bottom line is that the profitability of oil reserves in the North Sea is a dynamic thing and dependant on the world oil markets - not just on how much oil there is down there.

Once oil prices rise - which they inevitably will due to the nature of a worldwide dwindling finite resource - maybe not next year, or in 5 years, but steadily over the next decade or 2 - then it will become economically more viable to extract what oil there is left. 

Having said that, to me the oil seems to be a talking point without massive economic gain in terms of independence, once you factor in a sharing of the UK debt. It will be a positive, but hardly enough to increase the GDP of Scotland massively.

&gt;They were pragmatic with Nato, but even then, they said that continued membership of Nato was contingent on the removal of Trident. We're in a situation now where the Scottish public is (oddly) supportive of Nato, but much less so of Trident -- they've nothing to gain by compromising on the latter except alienating their support base. The SNP and the Scottish CND have a closely intertwined history, and it is not in the SNP's favour to spit on that.

&gt;If the SNP took a pro-leasing stance during the negotiations for independence, I guarantee there would be more MSP resignations than the two over Nato.

Also Iago is there for a sub up front, but isnt much at the moment.  
Joe Allen coming back when he does will also have more cover for the middle 3.

The Eleventh Doctor started brand spanking new, in every aspect, so I can see how that might be jarring to new viewers. But that's what separates people who can consider themselves fans of *Doctor Who* in general, to those who complain and moan that Tennant will always be the Doctor (not *their* Doctor, *THE* Doctor) and there's no reason to watch *Doctor Who* beyond Series 4.

&gt; UKIP will introduce franchising to education across Britain so that charitable associations, parent co-operatives, not-for-profit and profit-making companies can bid to run schools better than the public sector.  This will inject the ethos of successful private and state-run schools, whilst fixed assets, accountability and decision-making remain firmly in public hands.

---
&gt; UKIP will repeal the 1998 Human Rights Act and withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights.  We will pass legislation that establishes beyond doubt that schools and teachers have the right to discipline pupils without fearing legal action. UKIP will also give Schools the choice of whether or not to use corporal punishment, but does not advocate this as a party.

---

&gt; Education in Britain should prepare children for life as British citizens.  It is therefore important that children know something of the history and culture of the nation in which they live, including an awareness of our great literature and heritage. As language is an essential component in a nation’s culture, we will also insist that all lessons be taught in English with only the following exceptions:- 

The last one annoys me the most. A lot of more right wing parties feel the need to push 'Britishness' through schools, most often through History and English. Now, as a historian, I don't want History to become a propaganda lesson telling us how great British heritage is. It should be about learning about the world in general, not just our triumphs (because, let's be honest, they would inevitably avoid all the disasters and other things showing Britain in a bad light, not necessarily for propaganda reasons, rather because they don't want to show kids nasty things).

international law is one of the most misunderstood topics on reddit. It is not like domestic law applied to nation states... It's a set of treaties.

I haven't seen it firsthand, but I'm sure there is some level of 'Gas the Yids!'-esque mentality with opposing teams. And, of course, that should be the focus of the debate. Perhaps the Yids label enables them, but most likely they would be rude and idiotic anyways, yet the Yid gives them a highly offensive avenue to be anti-semitic. 

I am Jewish, and I love the Yid title. I like how Daniel Levy is the big, shrewd, clever Jew. I like how Jews are being associated with athletic excellence and talent, instead of just being lawyers and accountants. If it were up to me, the focus would be more on hooliganism than the nickname itself.

European football matches are a different animal, but the issue seems to be centered around the lack of civility, not the term itself.

Aspas just needs more experience to adjust. Like the article says, his touch and movement are great. Seems to me like he does get pushed off the ball a bit too easily, which gets him frustrated, and starts to effect his passing. He has a lot of loose passes. Keep bringing him on as a late sub, imo.

Sterling is gun. His lightweight problem is simply because he is young. He's still growing, he'll get bigger naturally. He's as good as he can be at 18, it's not like he's not training hard enough and could improve any more. Just needs more experience and age. Keep him as an impact sub. He is lightweight, but he knows how to get fouls, something Aspas needs to work on.

Not sure about this Skrtel thing though. He did play well and make some crucial, goal saving, tackles. But I can't forget the mistakes he made last season (ManCity 2-2). BR has bought CBs for a reason.

As for the writing, companions, recurring characters, and the quality of the series, don't worry, its still very watchable (Save for the lack Dalek episodes through out series 5 and 6). To me, the only thing I found lacking was Smith, and even then he wasn't awful, just not up to my own standard a least.

true,free2bejc,1986,Gianfranco Zola,"Well nice way to undermine your own argument right at the start there bud. Ramires has played less under Scolari (rightly so). When he has played he's been used out wider by Scolari, more like a defensive winger. He hasn't allowed all the responsibility to fall on Rami because he knows he can't handle it. Gustavo is used to sit behind him and Paulinho alongside him. Basically every game Rami is used, it's in conjunction with 2 other center midfielders. When Scolari only uses 2, Rami doesn't play. Also Brazil have only had 3 managers during the time Ramires has been in the national squad (although he wasn't in the confed cup squad). Under Dunga, he made 16 appearances. Under the two managers (so basically since 2010) he's made only another 16 appearances.

So anyway, Paulinho and Gustavo are preferred. I'd expect Fernandinho to get in games ahead of Rami but I'm not really sure why he doesn't play for Brazil. It might have something to do with him not coming up through the international youth set up. Anyway, we bid for him last summer. So there goes the idea that he's not good enough.

I don't disagree that the squad places aren't necessarily there but saying that we couldn't improve what is probably our weakest area is plainly not true.

Also, being an Anchor doesn't make one a true DM. There are other ways to be a DM. And I guess the best are an amalgamation. Martinez, Schweinsteiger and Vidal are all amazing DM's. As is Khedira but he's not as complete. But I guess who you must idolise then is Busquets. Pirlo is an example of the qualities we lack from that position. As for people that could reach Martinez and Schweinsteiger's ability to be essentially complete CM's we should have been looking at the French league. There's been many we should have got last summer. Including M'Vila, Witsel (who arguably could have been in that list I just made of exemplary DM's) l. Fellaini was sort of available last summer. As was De Rossi again. As was Fernandinho and Paulinho. Sandro was always going to Tottenham despite my love of the player although we probably made a bid. 

As for this summer. Illaramendi, Witsel probably, De Rossi sort of, Bender, Matic, Gundogan if we'd moved quickly. Gustavo (although I wouldn't like signing him), Paulinho and Fernandinho again. Kondogbia is slightly below them but he's much more rounded than both Ramires and Mikel. He's basically just experience away from being a combination of Ramires and Mikel plus an ability to play a long pass. Which is basically what all complete defensive midfielders are. And then a choice about equal to MVG, Capoue.

So to say there wasn't much available is stupid. To say that we haven't gone in for much is true (to the knowledge I'm aware of). To say that we shouldn't have gone in for improvements easily available is stupid.

As for your bold assertion (please stop saying random shit that lies there, unsubstantiatable without apparent basis, it's like me saying; this one time Ramires was like the best brazilian player ever in that game.)
&gt;the ones that left tried to sign him.

Ancelotti must be the only other manager you're talking about. AVB had loads of midfield targets, he wasn't awful at the squad overhaul, just the way he went about it. Dor us he brought in Miereles in the short term, who was a wonderful signing that got pissed off about AVB's sacking. He finally got his targets for us at Tottenham with Sandro and then Paulinho.

So back to Ancelotti. That season he joined PSG, he bought Thiago Motta. Basically that was the position Ramires would have had, gone to a better Italian. Oh and the squad already had Matuidi. A similarly good player to Rami. Now for the other managers who must have wanted Rami. Di Matteo hasn't been at another club. Benitez went to Napoli and there you could see he'd want to bolster the midfield but he has enough players. He'd need to get rid of some but most of them only just arrived the season before. Those that didn't are erm Inler, and you're not getting rid of Inler. (Or Hamsik)


And finally, don't make me laugh about Mou trying to sign him. IIRC that was a talksport rumour, and we all know they make those up for fun, you're also aware they've never worked with each other before right ahahahahaha.

Rather than also covering Bony, Lucas should have dropped back into the space.

Gerrard should have tracked Shelvey's run.

Even if neither midfielder does their job its still 2v3. Skrtel should see the danger earlier, and either get closer to shelvey or simply win the second ball as the flick to Michu is the only option.

Wisdom should tuck in earlier to track Michu.

This was to a principled opposition to fascism. It was a recognition that they would need allies if war was inevitable which drew the UK into a conflict it didn't want to fight, and even then there were massive propaganda campaigns to try to convince people to fight.

Sakho was constantly out of position because he's new and unfamilliar with team strategy and teammates. Which is fair enough, I'm sure he'll catch up.

The Scottish parliament uses a proportional representative voting system that was designed to prevent majorities: this is the SNP's second term, and they were returned with a majority. Part of that is due to SNP policies being popular, part of that is due to Scottish Labour and the Scottish Conservatives being so woeful.

There are certainly people in Scotland who dislike him intently, however the SNP have pretty much stepped into the ""left-leaning socially-aware"" ground that Labour used to occupy.

The people that mobbed Farage were mainly from a group called ""[Radical Independence](http://radicalindependence.org/index.php/2013/05/18/ric-statement-farages-hatred-not-welcome-in-scotland/)"". They're similar to Socialist Worker in terms of popularity - they're certainly noisy, but I think it's safe to say they don't enjoy mass support.

The UK media rarely give you a good picture. For example, last night Channel 4 News did a special on the referendum - discussing the ""Braveheart effect"". They are entirely missing what's happening in Scotland.

&gt; The Sunday Herald asked Downing Street for a contribution to the referendum debate at the beginning of last week. We were told the Prime Minister would be releasing some words… but, despite repeated attempts, we were unable to find out how many words he would be releasing. In the interests of balance, we allocated exactly the same space to David Cameron and to First Minister Alex Salmond. When the Prime Minister's statement reached us yesterday we told his office it fell far short of the First Minister's contribution, which it would be placed next to. At the time of going to press, nothing else had been received from Downing Street.

Salmond's piece is [here](http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/i-challenge-david-cameron-to-a-live-televised-head-to-head-debate-on-st-andrews-day.22154677), while Cameron's is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/1mfqkx/herald_gives_a_full_page_each_to_alex_salmond_and/cc8xvn7).

We managed to survive on just my wage and dipping into savings to pay the rent.  But that little bit of benefits my husband claimed helped to pay his bus fair to get into town and pay lunch sometimes.  It was really pittance, but it's all we had.  All I can say is, thank goodness it only took 3 months for him to find another job (this was before the crash), otherwise I don't know how I could have kept going.  It was soul-destroying for awhile as he knew we were dependent on my low wage and there were still anti-depressants involved due to a previous work place.

I know that there are some people who work there way around the system, but I have deep sympathies for those caught in it and can't find their way out.  For instance, on the BBC documentary Nick and Margaret: We All Pay Your Benefits was eye-opening.  One family did have the nice things, because they bought them before they lost their jobs.  It got to the point for them that they could only look for jobs that paid *above* their benefits otherwise their children could suffer more from the loss of income.

The odds of automatic inclusion in the EU is slim, and the odds of getting in with all of the UK's unique agreements like not joining the Euro  is remote at best.

There has been no real talk about how the borders will be redrawn, or who will have an actual part to play in that discussion (The EU may be brought in as an arbiter) and all in all Salmond's claims seem more like rhetoric than anything.

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; It's worth noting that they certainly wouldn't be getting all that oil as part of a state run enterprise.

There's a historical contribution from the rest of the UK to the development of the fields (just as there is a contribution from Scotland), but the North Sea is [already delimited](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/1126/contents/made) into areas covered by Scots Law vs English Law. Most of the oil fields lie in the Scottish area, most of the gas fields lie in the English area.

&gt; The odds of automatic inclusion in the EU is slim, and the odds of getting in with all of the UK's unique agreements like not joining the Euro is remote at best.

Scotland would not leave the UK until the process of entering the EU was complete: that process is undefined, but that is really because there is no precedent. As with German unification, it seems likely that a way can be found.

The main delay during EU applications is the time to harmonise nationalise legislation with EU legislation; that work has already been done for Scotland as part of the UK.

The UK, like Denmark, has an opt-out from the Euro. New member states are obligated to join the Euro, however they can essentially do so at a time of their choosing. As well as meeting certain economic criteria, they must also spend two years in the ERM II mechanism - membership of which is voluntary. Like Sweden, Scotland could simply decline to join ERM II (there are currently 9 EU members who are not using the Euro, 11 if you count UK/Denmark).

The UK also has an opt-out from the Schengen agreement - but then, so does Ireland. It seems quite plausible that the EU will consider the British Isles something of a special case and extend the same arrangement to Scotland too (Scotland would remain part of the [CTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Travel_Area) which is essentially a within-Britain version of Schengen).

&gt; There's no actual consensus on what to do with our nukes, and it seems the situation is highly inflexible as there aren't many suitable places across the rest of the UK to store or disarm the weapons. A future Scotland will likely wind up holding onto at least some of our WMDs anyway.

The Scottish Government position is pretty clear - Trident would be removed. The UK government has refused to discus it prior to the referendum, so the practicalities of any move are still to be decided. However there are [several options](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmscotaf/676/67607.htm) available.

&gt; There has been no real talk about how the borders will be redrawn

Why would any borders be redrawn? The UK already has existing land and maritime borders between its constituent countries.

&gt; Long story short, it would probably be a much safer bet to push for devolution or maybe even devo max for the Scottish parliament than a full blown split.

While I agree with the general sentiment. It takes years to build up an arsenal like we already have. In the event the world took a turn for the worse, we may not have time to put the system back in place.

Also, I think the points you've raised are valid; there'd likely be public outcry if we ever used them.

War has changed in that regard. I don't think you can justify Nagasaki and Hiroshima, but you can see some reasoning behind it; it was a show of force, and probably easier to pull off than sending a fleet of bombers to target specific parts of Japan.

The English ships, on the other hand, were built to be tough and capable of remaining at sea for extended periods (greater stores room). French captures were almost invariably bought into service. But not based upon the reports of the capturing officers, but on the viability of the vessel. Don't forget that at the time, the English government was experiencing something of a cash flow issue and was not eager to spend thousands based on hearsay. 

Speed and maneuverability were much prized at the time when being able to tack and run better than the other fellow often was the difference in who made the next cruise and who spent the rest of the war in a prison hulk.

And further, you must consider the corruption of the time when substituting sub-standard materials was not uncommon. Angus Konstam, 2001 *British Napoleonic Ship-of-the-Line*, Oxford, UK, Osprey Publishing, Ltd, mentions this practice as being the reason for the failure of the *Surveyor* class (1806), which was partially built with green timber rather than seasoned oak.

However, the question here is, can you starve on benefits, the simple answer is, only if you are a person who cannot manage your finances or boil water without burning it.  Nothing annoys me more than seeing folk on the tellybox who claim to be unable to give their kids breakfast in the morning while you can buy enough value porrige oats to feed a 2 kids breakfast for 2 weeks for less than a quid.  Make it with water and use a teaspoon of sugar and you are giving your kids breakfast for less than 5 pence, and that is only one meal.  Being a bit Yorkshire and having been out of work a few times I have in the last year fed 4 people for 15 pound a week, without missing any meals or getting scurrvy.  ( maybe it's about time the telly put somebody real on doing food instead of Jamie oliver telling you a real economy tip is to reuse the olive oil from your sun dried tomatoes ffs)

The solution here is education and financial management, I do think a proportion of benefits should be given in vouchers to ensure families have sufficient food, along with direct payments of rent to landords and vouchers for utilities. 

Of course nothing reinforces the idea of benefit recipients being scroungers more than the image of someone wearing a pair of brand new trainers and using an iphone to put on a bet while enjoying a pint down the local, especially if you are working your nuts off and cant afford any of these things. But think of it this way, this is the image we see but is only the tip of a much bigger iceberg, the bit you cannot see is the single mother who can't work because she is unskilled and childcare would cost more than a minimum wage job would afford her or what about the man in a wheelchair who dispite having a degree cannot get a interview.

No one is expecting turn key employees without having a high price.

However, it is worth noting that it is very hard for a small business to provide proper training.  Take software for instance.  If I take a computer science or maths graddy that can show aptitude, and train them for 1 year.  I'm already out of pocket probably about £50k just on the fixed costs (insurances, desk space, their salary, NI, equipment).  But the problem is I've now created someone who is worth probably 1.5 times the wage they were on before.  But I didn't really get much benefit until later on in that first year.  Effectively its cost me maybe £100k, to save £30k per year.  The only way its viable is if you are able to create an environment where that trainee would see a future and want to stay.

So when you say not willing to put the effort in, please understand it is very hard to do so.  I'm still debating with my business partner if we can afford two graddies next year.  His biggest concern is the cost of my time and productivity, my revenue generating output might drop too much because I am training them.

I think you could say that about most countries within the EU though? Most western european democracies enjoy a good standard of living, and they all have a very similar political and economic structure. That's not going to change.

What will change is what issues are considered to be important - a smaller population allows Scotland to focus on things like [improved childcare](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-18706446) or higher education, and not get sucked into things like Iraq or Libya.

&gt; Or maybe there are, if so I'd wish Salmond would get off the ""William Wallace"" and ""oil"" soap box and show us these figures.

The [GERS 2011-12](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/0041/00415871.pdf) report is a good starting point if you want to look at the raw numbers of Scotland's economy.

The Yes Scotland site also has a good set of [common questions and answers](http://www.yesscotland.net/answers), but keep in mind that the referendum is about *if* Scotland should become independent - not necessarily *how* it does so.

Some of the issues that would need to be resolved would need to be done so with other countries - Trident could only be removed with the UK's cooperation, accession to the EU would involve talks with the EC, etc. There will be elections in 2016, and it is perfectly possible that &lt;insert your party of choice&gt; could come up with proposals as to how we become independent which win them that election.

IMO the referendum is not about Salmond (he's 58 so, either way, he has another 10 years or so left in politics), any more than devolution was about Donald Dewer.

&gt;For small time landlords that own a few properties, all you have to do is move in to the property for a bit before you sell it (or move one of your relatives in and don't charge them rent: keep it all in the family)

Actually you always get CGT relief on the last 3 years, moving yourself or someone else in for a short period will achieve nothing. If you let a family member live in it you do not qualify for any private residency relief either.

&gt;If you have a larger portfolio and want to sell out then you can move to Belgium for a year or two &amp; sell the lot with no CGT due.
You really think people would skip the country for years to dodge some CGT? HMRC would still attempt to claim the tax for the increases while you were resident as well. How successful they would be is debatable.

Finally companies do not pay CGT they pay corporation tax.

Ah ok. Have they tightened this up in recent years? I'm sure the standard used to be a lot laxer.

&gt; Finally companies do not pay CGT they pay corporation tax.

Indeed. The net effect is the same however: no tax is due if an offshore holding company is sold that happens to own property in the UK (as I understand things; feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.)

&gt; You really think people would skip the country for years to dodge some CGT?

Yes, absolutely. I know a landlord that has done this. Bear in mind that you only need to be non-resident for tax purposes &amp; Belgium is a fast train ride away from London. You can ""live"" for tax purposes in Belgium and spend half the year in the UK before the Inland Revenue will regard you as being domiciled in the UK for tax purposes.

No, because that's not what these ""Utopians"" (for want of a better word) are asking for. They would insist that you MUST live in the house you purchase, therefore negating the possibility of owning a second property.

&gt; A much better analogy would be something like: If a supermarket buys massive stocks of wheat, then it should sell that wheat, instead of simply storing it for profit at a later date.

No, a much better analogy would be gold, which people buy and keep for many years as an investment. Land is also an investment.

Look it's simple. The government / banks have to offer a *better* form of investment, i.e. a decent rate of interest on savings. Who the hell is going to tie up their money for 20 years at a shitty 0.25% or 0.5% interest? They also have to mandate that the borrowing rate i.e. when people get mortgages / bank loans shall be no more than X times the savings interest rate, so there is a balance between those who wish to invest and those that wish to borrow.

Right now, the banks are STILL charging the same 11% - 20% interest on loans, but offering almost nothing back to savers - which was kind of the purpose of banks in the first place before they became solely motivated by profit.

But blaming / ostracizing people for wanting to invest for their futures is NOT the way to bring equality.

Unless an event specifically asks for a dress code you're okay turning up in anything clean and decent. Jeans and t-shirt as fine, bondage gear or pyjamas is pushing it, but more liberal universities won't mind too much. You can chose to dress formally if you wish but you may be the only one and you'll stand out. 

There will be a lot of alcohol and drinking and socialising is likely to revolve around it so my advice is 
* If you are teetotal be very clear about that with your peers, it's okay to drink orange juice or lemonade on a night out, if you make it clear it's not an issue for you people should accept that. 
*Don't feel that getting drunk is the only way to socialise at university. Join a sports team or a debating club or a subject-interest group. It's a great way to meet people and it will look good on your resume/cv once you've graduated. You should be introduced to lots of options of stuff to join in Fresher's week. Another option would be to volunteer for the student union, being involved with the organising side of social events. 

If you intend to start drinking do so at a steady pace, don't binge drink, you will be surrounded by kids that have been drinking for years and have built up a tolerance, have the odd pint with a meal to start with and be honest with people that you're not used to alcohol if you start to feel unwell. If you're going out to pubs/clubs go with someone you know and make sure people know when to expect you home. 

Don't be the American-student puking over everyone in fresher's week stereotype. It is not glamorous. Don't be embarassed about saying 'I'm feeling a bit peaky, I'll stick to lemonade thanks' if people take the piss just take it for banter and ignore it. 

Just bring anything you can't live without, we have food and drink and all the things necessary for life, but if there's a particular snack you would crave check before to see if you can get it here and take some with you if not

Both are criminal offences yet the police will often (in the many areas I've worked) shift the first onto the ambulance service and A&amp;Es because they haven't the resources and they don't like to deal with someone lying on the floor who can't stop vomiting. 

In my current area there was a man who got like this nearly every day, the police refused to deal with him, after a while the ambulance crews refused to take him and later the A&amp;E unit would stop admitting him whenever the police brought him in.

There are no minutes that they are willing to share more like. It seems unlikely that these highly paid business, innovation and science civil servants can go to a workshop like that and have absolutely nothing to show for it.

You've cited a study that says for FULL TIME workers it's 25k. As before, not everyone is in full time work. If you want to ignore that fact then yes, £25k is probably the median figure.

Data from a joint study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) and the J Rowntree foundation actually put the 50th percentile (aka median) household (so this includes data for two working adults in some cases) income at £418/week (or £21k year - in which case we were both £5k~ off);

Wait, so getting JSA is wrong but getting council housing is not? Plus you'd never get a council house unless you had kids. The waiting list is HUGE and single people don't have very many ""points"" (it is a points system) unless they're disabled or similar.    

&gt; It's there to tide you over in times of hardship   

So to live off of? Two posts ago you claimed it should be scrapped and replaced with food stamps, one post ago you called me an idiot for suggesting people live off of £50~ a week in JSA.    

&gt; if I was working in a 40 hour a week minimum wage job where is the actual incentive to work when I can just live off benefits and get near or close to the same amount of money annually?    

Because you take home more money working a 40 hr a week minimum wage job than you do benefits and JSA. It isn't even that close either unless you have a disabled person in your household.    

&gt; No it's not, maybe where you live and the trade that you're in it is, but that's bullshit if you're speaking for everyone.   

It is and you know full well it is. Everyone knows if you have a job interview you turn up looking your best, and if you're a guy you wear a suit, even if it is a cheap ASDA suit, you wear it.   

I'm not even going to argue with you on that because you know full well that is the custom.   

&gt; Because it made more sense financially to do that rather than continue to struggle on my own   

Fair enough. But you haven't reconciled your seemingly contradictory opinions: That it is fine for you to get bailed out but not fine for other people to get it.    

If people don't have a safety net as many people don't (particularly as they get older) then effectively you're saying that those people should be left out in the cold both literally and figuratively.    

But you on the other hand, you have no savings (but criticise others for having no savings), and should be entitled to JSA and or a council house (even while criticizing others for living off of JSA and a other benefits).   

The inside of your head is a confusing and contradictory place.   

&gt; Not everyone has that opportunity obviously, which leads onto the much loved and debated bedroom tax.    

Not really. The bedroom tax firstly isn't a tax, and secondly it has nothing at all to do with this topic. The so called ""bedroom tax"" is the council not giving people as much housing benefit if they are under-occupying a house, like two people living in a three bedroom house.

Now you try finding £800pcm for your bedsit when you've found a job paying £12k.  Now true perhaps there are other benefits you can claim, perhaps the house benefit claim itself can be restarted under the new circumstances... however anyone on benefits has seen the benefits system screw up.

So yeah.  I have a friend in that exact situation, it is exceptionally difficult to convince her to look for work in any meaningful way because the safest option, the one that keeps a roof over her head, is too do nothing.  And honestly I can't fault her logic; who here would risk sleeping rough?  As for most people that's a 'GAME OVER' scenario, you don't come back from it. 

Fixing and simplifying the benefits system so we don't have that cliff you fall off and it's easier to navigate is a good thing, but we also need to take to task these 'slumlords' as they are as much part of the problem (if not more so) than the actual benefits claimants themselves.

The problem with that is that generally you have to be a ""member"" (i.e. pay £25 a season for an official membership, which gets you ticket access as well as other benefits such as 10% off in the club shop etc), and you have to have had previous purchase history (sometimes as many as 8 games the previous season).

Cup games (especially the early rounds) are generally readily available on general sale. For the Europa League last season, all the home games, including the QF against Zenit, went to general sale.

true,Henghast,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"When I look at immigration it's often dependant on where the individual has come from. It's hard to argue that the large immigration of Polish workers was a bad thing. They came over, they speak English they share a good amount of culture with the majority of the nation and they're a net benefit. 

I think a lot of the issue is not with the primary earner but rather the families that follow. This looks particularly bad with immigrants from the sub-continent or Caribean as they tend to follow a different approach to the family which sees them have large close knit groups with no requirement to integrate. This along with their cultural and financial traditions means they tend to often buy parts of a street or an entire street creating an area in which English is not the common language. 

Onlookers then see these growing areas as more people move into them and expand the area impacted and feel ostricised in their own home towns. This is regardless of the benefit the primary carers for the family brings to the region or nation. 

I don't believe immigration is bad and I understand well the above is an anecdotal example of the perception of bad immigration. I do however believe that immigration is an issue in so much as people do not immerse themselves in the country, it's history and it's traditions but rather create a subsect of their own homes here. It seems counter-intuitive to me that if someone wishes to live here then they should wish to do so in a way that segregates themselves from what it means to be British, English, Welsh, Scottish or Irish.

As an engineering student you're totally right about two-stroke engines having far worse emissions. (In fact, two-stroke outboard motors for boats were banned outright from sale a few years ago - now the only way to get a small 2hp engine is to go fully four-stroke, which is of course more expensive, larger, and heavier on the back of your inflatable dinghy).

What's the logic of motorcycle tax being coupled to engine size, not emissions? Presumably, trying to make it harder for novice young riders to get a very powerful bike.  
But is the tax rate literally tied just to engine CC capacity, and not power output? Surely that would mean that a naturally-aspirated engine could be slower and less powerful than a slightly smaller forced induction one, yet still end up paying more.

Personally, I think that if we have lots of Band A cars like the Fiat 500 paying £0 VED, motorcycles should be exempt from such taxes as well. It's not as if they contribute to congestion problems, or road surface wear.  
In the absence of a cycling revolution, we could solve a lot of traffic and fuel consumption issues if more people were prepared to do short journeys by motorbike. It's a shame it's a niche thing, it's way more efficient than a large car carrying a single person.  
The German gov't has recently gone for an interesting compromise - they are building bike paths between towns, and trying to encourage the widespread rollout of e-bikes to ordinary people: so that those not fit enough to regularly cycle unaided (like the elderly) can still run errands without a car.

Against poor teams:

Ruddy
Whittaker Bassong Turner Olsson
Fer Johnson
Snodgrass Hoolahan Redmond
RvW

Against good teams:

Ruddy
Whittaker Turner Bassong Garrido
Fer Tettey
Snodgrass Hoolahan Redmond
RvW

the only differences between those two are tettey and garrido in vs. good teams for Johnson and olsson. I think a left side of olsson and redmond would leave itself pretty open to a counter-attack as they both are so fond of rushing up the pitch, and a bit less keen (redmond especially) on defending. Garrido dosn't go forward as much, and so can normally cover for redmond when he goes forward, but when it becomes too much tettey (Who i think is better defensively than johnson in terms of staying back and just tackling the shit out of everyone who comes past) can come over to help him out.

Tettey knows he is not a playmaker, and so just tackles the opposition and plays the simple pass. Last season this simple pass often went to either Johnson or Turner/bassong, but i tink that with fer in the middle with him who can create stuff, it would help us keep posession far better against top teams like tottenham which we did not do last week than if Johnson was playing, who seems to just hoof the ball forward as soon as he can.

I feel like Matt Smith never truly played The Doctor according to Smith, I felt like most of the time he played The Doctor according to what he thought people thought The Doctor should be played like. Some scenes, to me, you could tell he was trying to hard or acting to much and it just broke the illusion for me, as well the fact that his quirkiness to me seemed almost forced most of the time. With Tennant,  I felt imerresed in the fantasy at all times and he never really seemed out of place, he felt natural and native to me as The Doctor. When 10 felt something, you knew the most extreme of a weary old lonely travelers sorrow, anger, joy, or humor, and with Smith I never got that same feeling of extreme emotional attachment that comes with truly being able to see what makes a character click.

As for being outshined by companions, I agree that Amy was pretty flat, but I thought Rory was excellent. I felt more sadness for the ""death"" and death of Rory in ""The Angels Take Manhattan"" than The Doctors loss and anger of Amy commiting timeicide to pursue Rory into the past. Rory felt like the every man who had almost everything stacked against him, including the fact that not only did he face danger and death often, but was almost forced to fight a battle to keep his wife to be in love with him. Yes, I know in the end that Amy and Rory stick together, but almost always, it took a near death experience on Rory's part to pull Amy's full concentration and admiration away from The Doctor, which to me adds a huge amount of depth of character.

If a country declared war on Britain, (first of all, in the current world this would be a very poor decision for any country, not just to declare war on Britain but any country in NATO, as an act of war or attack on any one country would be an attack on all.) But lets assume for this insance for whatever reason nato isn't an issue and Britain did something stupid and got into a war or were attacked. If it was just small scale war such as the Falklands was no country would use weapons of that magnitude over some small islands, there would obviously be no need to use nuclear weapons. WMD's aren't just used at the first sign of war for obvious reasons. The only time they were ever used was against Japan and only to finish a war (Quite a large war) quickly instead of launching the largest military invasion in history, killing literally millions of soldiers in the process. World leaders are very aware of the powers of nuclear weapons and would not use them lightly. The only instance Britain would use it's nuclear arsenal would be if it was the only viable way to stop another country attacking/destroying Britain or an ally incapable of defending itself. A very literal ""us or them scenario in which public opinion would be very much for im sure.

&gt;We aren't in a World War or Cold War situation at the moment, surely having a nuclear deterrent is old fashioned in the modern days of not invading armies but single terrorist bombers?

Very true and the US and Russia have both severely dropped the number of warheads they have compared to the amount during the cold war. But a nuclear arsenal takes time to develop and build up, and the human race is far from having world peace and sadly we live in a time where having a nuclear deterrent is debatabley needed for larger world leading countries. There is no immediate threat, but there's no way of knowing what it going to happen in the next 30-80 years. Things can change fast.

&gt;Even if we did preform a complete nuclear disarmament, if we needed some missiles if/when WW3 hits we could borrow some from the US or France.

Other countries in NATO think the same of us, I personally think as the 3 members of the security council in nato we have a partial responsibility to sustain these weapons as well as france and the US, it isn't something that should solely rely on a single country. It's mutual defence alliances like these that prevent the need for every single country to have it's own nuclear arsenal and still feel safe.

There's also a ton of stuff on their boards.

My tips would be:

1) Budget

2) Food/eating plan

3) Cooking is easy, use the internet to learn to cook properly. 


Some additional thoughts:

- Go vegetarian (meat is expensive)
- Pasta, beans, rice and frozen veg make top class staples
- Get your spices from asian supermarkets or online - don't ever buy glass jars
- Grow your own chillies from seed on a windowsill from february/march. This will pay BIG dividends over the summer. This can apply to Fresh basil in the summer too.  Growing from seed is dead easy.
- Avoid branded items where possible
- Sliced bread can live in the freezer very happily and be toasted on cue.
- Consider investing in a delivery plan for you grocer of choice - buying food online saves money on impulse buys and helps with budgeting. this is also great as a student if you don't have a car and don't need to rely on what you can carry.
- Making large portions of cheaper foods (bakes etc) means leftovers for the next day. Learn to love leftovers.
- NEVER BUY READY MEALS
- Learn to use garlic properly - I hate to say it but those £1 glass jars/tubes of pre-chopped stuff last in the fridge for ages and works out cheaper/easier than peeling/smashing your own.
- Olive oil is a key ingredient. 


I know people love LIDL/ALDI but I've never found them particularly cheaper - and what you get is a bit of a 'pot luck' - so budgeting / planning ahead is difficult. 

Eating properly is important - and doing it on a budget IS possible. I'm going to push the boat out and say you are a bloke- if so, learn to cook WELL. Girls will absolutely love you for it  - identifying cheap plonk that isn't horrific is a good skill too (hint: www.cellartracker.com/) &amp; knowing how to mix the odd drink isn't a bad idea either.

Uni is amazing - I loved my time and I wish you the best of luck.

We have no idea what the world is going to look like in twenty years. We don't know if Russia is going to be more aggressive. We don't know if NATO is going to be disbanded by an increasingly eastern orientated America. We don't know if any Islamic theocracies are going to pop up in North Africa.

We do not know for certain what is going to happen.

Consequently, the existence of a nuclear program not dependent on the Americans or Europe which we can control is a massive safeguard which ensures that we are not left in a position of profound weakness.

Another frustrating factor is the commercialisation of the field (especially in this climate of seeing everything for its cash value) - a lot of museums are either hiring zero-hour staff who will be cheap and replaceable (so she's overqualified) or hiring staff with knowledge of museums as businesses, rather than  knowledge of the artefacts themselves (so she's wrongly qualified).

Basically, she's caught in a market where there is increasing competition for low-mid level jobs, and what jobs *are* genuinely entry-level are now looking for business, rather than academic, skills.

It's also a very connected world, and having to choose unsuitable jobs can stymie you later on (for example, she's been interning in a museum for one type of history, but her qualifications are in another.

I happen to live in France where most medical services are provided privately, paid for by a combination of state , mutual insurance schemes and customers' cash. French medical care is reckoned to be amongst the best in the world and is generally 'free' to the insured patient. From my experience the choice, quality and promptness of service here is of a much higher order than in the UK. 

I would therefore dispute your claim that a private system necessarily winds up as scandalously inefficient as the US case.

Now, which is more likely? A fairly slight player jumps to avoid contact and gets a sharp kick to the testes from a very big defender. Because he's in the air already, the point of contact becomes the rotation point and he hits the deck because he was already in the air and because he just had all the wind kicked out of him.  He lands poorly because his body is already twisting to try to protect his testes. Bam.

Or, a slight player who has been taken down many times decides that the boot to the balls wasn't enough and is just playing theatrics.

Great. But it's not an unheard of position.  Many people are simply jealous of their lost youth or other people's enjoyment whilst they themselves are unhappy.

&gt;I admit I was generally the person at bars who sat there though wondering why the hell everyone else was happy to be in such a horrible place, loud, can't have a proper conversation partly due to everyone, self included, being stupified by drink, partly due to the terrible, terrible music that for some reason was popular, perpetually worried someone would try and guilt me into having sex with them for daring to lead them on by looking at them or trying to have a conversation.

I hear you, I was very similar about night clubs for a long time, whilst being tight with a group of people who were obsessed with clubbing.  Being sober in a pub or club generally shows up the bad ones, to which others more inebriated are oblivious, and generally is less conducive to a good night.  On the other hand, if you didn't like the music, there are plenty of niche venues in most UK towns and cities (god, I wish we had them in Asia, but currently they're thin on the ground).  The guilting into sex thing is a very basic human relations issue - and I've faced it as a sober man with drunken women, and as a drunken man with sober women, so I know it goes every which way.

Yes British alcohol culture is not always pretty, but so long as it's not destructive of people or (personal) property I'm okay with it.  When it crosses the line, we have laws (in fact we have laws well before it crosses any lines).  Personally, I've been drunk on, ahem, numerous occasions, and to borrow from Bill Hicks, I've never mugged anyone, raped anyone, killed anyone, lost a house, a job, a car, a relationhip etc.  I might have said some things I shouldn't/wouldn't have, but at least half of those have led me down good paths...",0,1379518055,null,0,1379519550,0,ccasgyp,t3_1mm0oh,t1_ccasgyp,t1_ccarv5x,null,1429421811,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

If we want to progress as a club that is what we must aim for. Just look at the midfield optoons of all our rivals.

Henderson has not got the vision and range of passing to be a successful number 10, at this point in time anway.

Gerrard's days of playing that role have come to an end under BR. Though this may actually be our best option.

How much game time has Alberto actually got in the PL. BR has said that he is one that needs to develop into the first team. Counting on him in a pivotal role in the team at this stage is risky business. 

Coutinho may not have been playing to the highest of levels but he was playing the role correctly in between the lines, trying to link midfield and attack etc. 

His attributes suit that role which, as I have said previously, is pivotal to the system we play 99% of the time. 

Otherwise it's inexperience or square pegs in round holes.

Well this is the issue.  Look at the title of this thread, you can starve on benefits.  One side is worried that we have a very large state, the other, that it is too small.  You then get emotive things such as this title.  Believe you me it is very possible to starve on a large amount of money a month if you aren't frugal with your money.  I once had my mortgage come out twice due to a paperwork error.  This was also whilst I was between jobs.  Lucky for me it was only for 3 days, and I had food in the cupboard.  But if I hadn't had savings that could be readily accessed, I'd have been making a few trips to cash converters.

The arts and museums and the like are obvious things to cut.  The sad thing is, if people don't value the work she does, she has no job.  She might value what she does, but she is reliant on the general public doing so.  Frankly I think free school lunches will get more votes than museum funding.  So actually bemoaning the fact they are wanting more business skills isn't really a bad thing.  In the way that animal charities raise more money than many people think they should compared to say homeless charities, marketing and making people value what you do is important.

People are often very fickle, they will say that something is very important to them, when really they don't give a damn.  The finances of the real world sadly only care about people making good on their claims.  My point is someone has to make the people want to pay for these things.

The problem is this. There's a mindset in the UK that property prices always go up, people think they go up faster than wages, faster than savings. This in the long term cannot happen.

For over a decade prices have only gone up due to extra credit in the economy. Wages and Rents have not increased as quickly, in fact they've been fairly flat. Now with all this extra debt in the system politicians are trying to inflate the UK economy out of debt. That is why inflation has been over 2% for ages whist interest rates at have been practically 0% However the debt is so large and the mindset so intrenched that people actually think that it's bad when house prices don't go up.

The simple solution is money... they currently do not make much money from motorcycles, (better fuel economy in general, home maintenance etc) , add to that the powers that be don't really give a shit about emissions or the environment, all they care about is the ""perception"" that they care. I will concede that some larger cc motorcycles give out more emissions in terms of nitrate (I think that is the word) but the methods are inconsistent. For example motorcycle MOT's do not include emissions test (black smoke will still fail). Only new bikes have to follow the new regs.

The silly thing is this is counter productive. Take my [GSX650F](http://www.globalsuzuki.com/motorcycle/moto/street/gsx650f/feature.html), 650cc engine, with catalytic converter and EURO3 compliant and with a tad over 80hp, yet I have to pay £76 a year VED. 

Yet an 8 year old Kawasaki ninja, 500 cc no catalytic converter, 50hp, and poorer fuel economy and greater emissions pays £55.

&gt;  Presumably, trying to make it harder for novice young riders to get a very powerful bike.

A tenner is bugger all with regards to the overall cost of a bike.
Also using the above examples, the GSX650F is much much more learner friendly than the ninja 500, so it cannot be a safety aspect.

The only thing I can think of is due to after-market customisation, most people change an exhaust on a motorcycle but not on a car.

Overall I think it is just because they do not like motorcycles.

Did I say hitler was a left winger?  Stop putting words in my mouth.  What I said was the BNP manifesto is left wing.  I shouldn't have said ""hard left"" -- that was incorrect, and just rhetoric.

And again: racism has nothing to do with left or right.  Whatever the BNP are, it does not carry a stigma for that political side.  Just as their are left and right wing dictators -- it doesn't ""smear"" either political viewpoint.

The left is terribly fond of picking everybody's favourite racist, Hitler, and using the fact that he was racists and right wing to imply that all right wingers are racists.  Which is simply not true.

Disagree that Henderson doesn't have the vision or range of passing- he has both to at least the degree of Coutinho, with his vision maybe being slightly less and his range of passing being better I'd say.  What he doesn't have is the ability to ghost past defenders with the ball that Coutinho has, but in his defense I'd also say he's much less likely to lose the ball.  Think you're perhaps underrating Henderson and overrating Coutinho, but it's an opinion game so I can appreciate the disagreement there.

Agreed Alberto isn't ideal (I'd personally give Hendo a shot, as I mentioned) but he's not half-bad at all and some game time wouldn't hurt his development a bit.

Then he berates our DMs for not tracking the run (see the picture). But the thing is, they don't track the run because they've been told not to, for reasons stated. If Sakho stays in place for the second goal, Shelvey no longer has a free header, but is challenged by a correctly placed Sakho. Should Shelvey by some miracle win that challenge, Skrtel is now not covering for Sakho, but is now in a position to block Michu. Ergo, Sakho misjudged the situation and created a free header and an open shot. Huge error from the Frenchman (though all is forgiven 'cause he's new).

I found when I was having a bit (i.e. a spliff, or two) most nights it was turning me into a boring, irritable twat. The problem was, I thought it was just me being me - when things like that happen, it's hard to attiribute them directly to something. So I stopped smoking and all of a sudden became more interested in the world again.

People scoff at the labels on the side of beers saying that drinking more than 1.5 cans of lager is irresponsible. But I have no doubt that if you did that every night of the week it would change you.

Unlike an army, which is seldom a career, a Navy possesses an institutional memory that is only as good as the oldest experienced officer who is able to pass along lessons learned.

As for a general practice to aim at the rigging, those orders came from micro-managing landlubbers who's only concern was to capture hulls suitable to transport and protect an invasion army bound for England. While on the other hand, the English Navy fired for effect. If they were outgunned in single action, they would fire to take out gun crews (remember, the French crews were not as sharp, so casualties hurt them more), or for disablement by taking down rigging/sails/masts. For a ship to lose mobility meant that their opponent could rake them from stem to stern, making it a surrender or die situation.

Learning to fight a ship is not something that one can really learn with models on a sand table, as was done with infantry or cavalry. A sea officer had to *be* a true sea officer to effectively fight a ship, unlike an army officer who ""sort of"" controlled a group of men by ordering which direction to go and when to fire, a sea officer needed to understand how to actually maneuver a ship in close quarters to best take advantage of current sea conditions and be able to control the fire of gun crews who had to be able to lay their cannon by being thoroughly trained to do so. That's not something that can be learned by pushing ship markers around. The theory is easy enough to pick up, but the there's a vast difference between markers and the sea. 

The sailors were trained in their duties by more experienced sailors and by the midshipman and lieutenants, who were themselves trained by more senior lieutenants and by the Commander/Captain. The Navy was a profession. Even for common sailors it was not uncommon for men to have served for many years on various ships. The Navy was the first service where cross-training was practical and actually practiced due to the length of service.

French losses were in proportion to their skill level, which was downright dismal after the revolution and began to rise slowly until the passing of Adm. Latouche-Tréville. Now, that man was a sailor.

There's three big universities in one city; Glasgow Uni which is the historic, prestigious one, Strathclyde (or Strathy) which is where most of the working class kids in the west of Scotland go, and Caledonian (or Caly) which is full of international students, along with the Scots.

People in South East England who have never been north of Birmingham like to mock Glasgow as violent, but it's actually got a great mix of cultures. It's got a very creative and arty culture but is also working class, so it isn't too annoyingly wanky (see: Edinburgh) but not to gritty either. You could be in the West End surrounded by ipads and hipsters and a 10 minute train journey will take you to solidly working class areas like Springburn.

As others have said, Glasgow is particularly good for music, with a lot of fantastic venues, and it's produced a lot of great bands (see, most recently, ChVrches).

Also famous for its art, with Glasgow University's Art School being one of the most prestigious in the UK.

I worked briefly at Glasgow Caly. Largish campus, and a 10 minute walk from the city centre. I think I'm right in saying it's got a good reputation but you'll probably know better than me about that.

Glasgow is also great for transport links because its a big hub to England and the rest of Scotland. There are regular trains to Edinburgh, which is a half hour or so away, and to London, which takes about 5-6 hours on the train if I remember correctly. Also lots of buses and planes, which are usually cheaper than the trains (a train is about £120 return to London).

true,paleogirl,mccoy,McCoy,"Hmm, perhaps unsurprisingly, I disagree strongly with that assessment. 

For Moff, we've got Amy, River, and Clara to look at.

Amy has the choice between her idealized vision of an unattainable man, and the very real love of a very good (and attainable) man. She starts off as most NuWho companions seem to, choosing to chase after the Doctor. The Doctor, once he's clued into to what's going on, puts the brakes on that whole situation post haste by bringing Rory on board and literally (as the Dream Lord) forcing her to choose.

Fortunately for my sanity, she chooses the smart option, and gradually reinforces and strengthens that choice over the course of the following seasons. Ironically, this has the side effect of *deepening* Amy's relationship with the Doctor, since she is now relating to him in a way he is capable of reciprocating with a human for whom he considers himself responsible-- i.e., friendship.

As far as agency, Amy does lose her agency rather badly during the pregnancy arc. She regains it with a bang in TWoRS, by murdering Madame Kovarian in revenge for the actions taken against her and her child-- a decision which would have shocked and dismayed the Doctor, had he known of it.

Finally, Amy again asserts her agency by giving herself over to the Angel in TATM, returning to Rory even as the Doctor begs her not to. Contrast this to the Tenth Doctor's actions with Donna in Journey's End. Amy and Rory go on to live a long life together, dying in their eighties after decades of devoted marriage.

The interesting (to me, at least) flip side of this is that *Rory* actually does spend quite a bit of time chasing after someone who is treating him rather badly. If his 2000 year vigil had occurred before Amy firmly chose him over the Doctor as her love interest, instead of after, I would have found that very sad indeed. As it was, it still cemented the character in my mind as something of an unrealistic ""fantasy man."" The fact that I still adore Rory probably makes me a bit of a hypocrite.

On to River. River is interesting to me for two reasons-- first, for her, the Doctor is not unattainable. She chased him, she caught him, she married him, and she's bedded him. (Apparently, she's quite the screamer.) Second, she manages to subvert the concept of agency more than any other character I can think of.

The Doctor both is, and is not, responsible for her. His existence led to her being kidnapped and turned into a weapon during childhood... but she defied her handlers and refused to kill him. She went to prison to protect his secret... but she can escape any time she wants to and have adventures. She has a successful career, separate from the Doctor (eventually); she can travel in time and space under her own power. The Doctor is, in some ways, at her beck and call-- as long as she can find something big and important enough to graffiti.

If they're not equals, they're pretty darned close, and it's the lack of a power imbalance that makes the relationship possible.

Post-Library... now that's interesting. River exercises agency in her own death, physically overpowering and restraining the husband-who-doesn't-know-her-yet in order to protect her own past, and his future. She does not, however, have any agency when the Tenth Doctor decides to save her data ghost to the Library hard drive. 

At the time, she seems happy enough about his unilateral decision. However, the Eleventh Doctor treated her rather cruelly (in a misguided attempt to protect his own feelings) by pretending not to be able to see her projection, when she appeared to him. She eventually got the closure she apparently wanted in TNotD, but that ending didn't sit well with me, and I hope it's not left there.

Then, there's Clara. I'll admit, Clara really isn't doing it for me yet, I think because it's very difficult to write a character who is a complete mystery, but also fully developed.

On the plus side, she has no romantic interest in the Doctor beyond teasing him. On the minus side, it turns out that, whoops!, her whole existence (multi-faceted as it may be) revolves around saving him, at the cost of her own life. On the plus side, she made the decision to devote herself to that goal with her eyes open, and with a reasonable understanding of the consequences, thanks to River.

Also on the plus side, instead of accepting the sacrifice and moving on, Eleven has, at this point, risked nebulous but presumably dire consequences to rescue her, in return, and give her back her ""normal"" life, moving forward. So as far as I'm concerned, the jury's still out on Clara.

So, them's my thoughts. I love the Grand Moff, and I'm all over the mutual fucked-upedness that is Doctor/River, and the actually-not-very-fucked-upedness that is Amy/Rory. But I'd be very interested to hear what it is about Moffat's stuff that bothers you, because one of the things that is endlessly fascinating about Doctor Who is that two people can watch it and take diametrically opposite things away from it.",0,1379521678,null,0,false,0,ccatrkx,t3_1mgwep,t1_ccatrkx,t1_ccamfyc,null,1429421207,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,Mynameisaw,yorkshire,West Yorkshire,"This is where research comes in. It's not a quick process, this is why decriminalisation is required first. Allow people to consume at their will, but persecute anyone selling as it's an ""unregulated"" substance, then spend a year or two researching the matter in great detail, find out what the recommendation is and then allow distribution under guidelines. 

Personally my life is in such a state at the moment it's next to impossible for me to isolate what's causing it, weed ultimately hasn't helped so I cut back, but things aren't that much better even with that. 

I'll be trying a few weeks starting this Friday without it at all, no improvement and I'll buy another Ounce to last me the following month.

I think the ultimate issue is that people have very little understanding of what goes on inside their own heads, so when you mindlessly take any substance, weed, alcohol, tobacco or whatever your choice, it can have adverse effects just based on how you are as a person. 

I'll use myself as an example, I've suffered from Depression and Anxiety since I was 16 (21 now.) so I know I'm the root cause of these two emotions, as I didn't start smoking weed until about a year and a half ago. 

So with that in mind, and the fact my quality of life has improved dramatically since I was 16, hell, even since I was 20 (around the time I started.) then I can safely say weed isn't the *cause.*

However, what I can't say is that weed isn't exacerbating the chaos in my head, it makes it harder to focus, it makes it harder for me to care, which ultimately when in a sober state makes me annoyed that I didn't do anything.

My solution? No smoking pre 9pm. I spend my day dealing with things properly, working and generally trying to fill a void which I can't remember not having, and then when it gets to 9pm, if I still feel shit I'll have a smoke to calm myself down. 

On the contrary, I know people in my situation who used Weed as a crutch, spent every day smoking it and ultimately has ended up having to go to the Doctors and quitting smoking entirely on the basis they can't handle it. It's all or nothing for some people. 

Basically, what I'm saying is, weed, just like alcohol is extremely hard to say ""Amount X is fine."" Because ultimately it's entirely dependant on a persons circumstance and how much dependence they develop on the substance.

He yelled at River because she was forced into the horrible situation of breaking her own wrist. WTF? That's not the Doctor we all know and care about. At the very least, we don't want to go back to the days of Six with even worse writing and nastier behavior. 

Moffat in general has a hard time not sexualizing his female characters all the while letting them have their own agency. He essentially gave the OK for the doctor to blame Amy for wearing a skirt rather than question his own brilliant judgment of making a glass floor. Before he was promoted, he always pushed Rose to the back and made shallow love stories out of likes of Ten and Reinette, most notably. She has nothing to live for except the Doctor and waited forty something years for him. And they met when she was a child which is a creepy plot device that Moffat loves abusing btw, even the seemingly harmless remark right at the end of that two parter he wrote about The Empty Child. He essentially wrote in the line about Nine giving Rose a red bicycle for her twelfth Christmas. Ew. And Amy and Clara being kids too. Anyway, compare this to the Titanic Christmas special where Astrid and Ten kiss, and when Joan kisses John Smith, they their relationships had much better depth and chemistry. And uh, just better writing in general. 

Moffat is creepy, he's sexist and the thought of a female doctor literally never even entered his head. Very surprising how you wrote an actually pretty compelling and hard hitting argument against Meta and Rose's relationship finds him a favorable writer. He just squicks *me* out.

Alberto, Gerrard and Henderson are options for that position but far from ideal at this point in time for various reasons.

I thought we needed to provide more quality in this area of the pitch over the entire transfer window while other people argued against. 

I feel there are a couple of positions we need more quality in and thought there were opportunities to do business in the summer to improve the team.

I feel, unfortunately,  at this early stage of the season I am being proven correct.

Edit: I realise British crews had far more experience of being actually at sea and also had the then new flintlock ignition system, however their firing practice was usually limited due to the desire of the captains to harbour their gunpowder against the possibility of real action.

As she states in her blog, last year it was literally just a costume contest, Just because most of the cons you have been to require skits doesn't mean every one does. They did not find out about the skit requirement until the day OF! Those involved with HoC knew in advance and had time to prepare so much so that they had a light show and prerecorded dialogue. Anyone would be frustrated and upset by that.

The audience saw what had happened (anyone who was not associated with HoC had been screwed over) and reacted accordingly. Forget the show, people can be made to believe anything with good editing, the HoC lashed out first with, ""How dare you! I spent $2000 of my own money flying this here!"" wen the Dr. Who girls decided to go home.

Now I do agree, they should have kept their cool and just let it go but at the same time, if I were them I would have probably reacted very similarly.

However, if you do what Luiz does (and in the video there are 2 other clips showing Luiz doing just that), (if it works) not only you ruined the opposite attack, but you already mounted the counter attack and you have superiority: the def mid that doesn't have to turn around and the cb that has the ball, 2 more people in the middle. However, in order to properly pull this up, you need both full cooperation from your defending mates, so they know when to close the line behind you and the brains to chose the right moment. And let's face it, in the Everton's goal case, Luiz just made a very bad decision.

Sorry, i'm not following the analogy. But I think you read my post and immediately assumed I'm defending HoC and think that they and everyone involved is squeaky clean. And then also assumed the blog post is factual and unbiased. What I'm trying to say is that elitism goes both ways. You can't stand on a soap box and say, ""I spent $50 on this and cosplay and I only do it for fun. And you're ruining it with your professional career and cameras! Get out elitist."" 

That's just another form of elitism. You still got to dress up, you still had people freak out when they saw you. Hell, you got to be on TV at no additional cost. If it's just for fun, then none of what HoC did to competition should matter. 

Reality is that it does matter, it's not simply for fun. People don't like be upstaged. Especially when it's unfairly. So now what? We stone each other?

Then there are the political games where managers will keep changing their minds about what they want under the impression that going over the delivery date will mean they get a rebate, or hold the contract company to ransom over a badly-worded proposal, apparently oblivious that the contract company will now cut their own staff to keep within budget.

Then you have autonymous departments that will decide that actually, they want to get Office 2010 but keep Windows XP so that they can pretend they're saving £30,000 on having an app re-written when it actually then costs the Council/ Hospital/ etc. much more than that in developing and releasing an XP image just for them.

The other problem is that the permanent wages at a hospital are almost as bad as it gets for IT work - I doubled my salary the day I left - and their hands are tied in terms of offering more anyway (everyone else on that pay grade will then demand a rise too) - so they have no choice but to bring in contractors.",0,1379527217,null,0,false,0,ccavtl2,t3_1mmu42,t1_ccavtl2,t1_ccapab0,null,1429420248,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Now, myself I'd take being raped in the shower over watching my family shot whilst I have to hunt rats to stave off starvation.

The prison system in the US may be a complete disgrace.  But to suggest that only privatised prisons are exploitable is frankly ignoring the world.  You also get on reddit this, I'm not sure what the term is, childish is rude, ignorant is rude, but someone who hasn't ever done anything, they've got that viewpoint.  It leads to such things as State of XX guarantees prison service at least 10,000 inmates.  Now that might sound like judges have to send people to jail to fulfill the contract, but it's not about that.  Building a prison takes years, and you need a guarantee of demand, the government underwrites that.

If you picked your most free-marketeer, they wouldn't begin to say that privatised prisons would be better for the inmates, only that they are more efficient for the person paying the bills.

If we Assume Sakho is not supposed to push up and Bony turns towards goal, Lucas is going to be behind him Sakho preventing him from going further but more importantly Shelvey is running into space with noone tracking him, Bony can lay it off to Shelvey who has space for a shot from a decent area, or he could try and play in Michu who is between the fullback and the centre back. 

TL:DR - If Sakho doesn't push out we have a problem pretty much no matter what you do.

Now lets just consider for a second Lucas was supposed to track the runner, Sakho comes out to meet Bony who has found space, Shelvey runs but Lucas covers. Bony passes, Sakho retreats to get back into position and the ball in is harder to hit as Lucas is there. Swansea hold possession by passing it back to Bony - Sakho has time to get back into defence and Lucas comes out to cover Bony.

Of course this only covers one scenario but in my head I thought the whole point of a defensive midfielder is to stop the opposing midfield from making these sort of runs etc. However I should point out this is only my opinion and it could just as easily be considered that Wisdom was supposed to be much tighter to Michu (see Skrtel in first image) and that he was supposed to prevent Michu getting a free shot at goal",0,1379528160,null,0,false,0,ccaw65g,t3_1mm9ho,t1_ccaw65g,t1_ccav6bs,null,1429420085,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

Wow - and you're not? You're going from personal experience and they're *all* saints in your mind *in spite of being presented with first hand accounts of the opposite*. But whatever - you'll put me down for my own observations while believing only yours are true. Makes you a hypocrite, though, doesn't it. Or idiot.

&gt; A lot of British Muslims are British born, and grow up in working class areas.

And went to British schools? I guess they missed everything to do with cultural values in the UK - especially the part about how disrespectful it is to cover your face. I'm, of course, being sarcastic - the kids know full well what they are doing and like many of the less respectful they will push boundaries - the problem is people like you are *encouraging* them! You're less of a hypocrite more of an anti-British society fuckwit.

&gt; There's a perfectly reasonable and well known and perfectly harmless reason for the face covering.

Bullshit. Especially in London. Why do you think there's CCTV everywhere? So people can take the piss and hide their identity? How fucking stupid do you have to be to miss the obvious?

&gt; I propose instead of the police state you suggest, we go for a presumption of innocence.

Well good for you Mr Liberal. I'm certainly more open minded than you in that I actually accept what I see - while you close your eyes and think ""no, no, it's not possible, crime is not possible!"" And there's just no place for face coverings in the UK. None. Even if you *did* assume (stupidly) that everyone in a ninja outfit was *super* nice then you'd be naive enough to believe that every beggar sitting in front of an ATM in London was actually broke. Good for you but it's no good for society to let cons run around getting away with abusing nice people.

Don't get me wrong - I've got no problems with people practicing whatever local customs they want to practice in countries with those customs. If I visit Japan I won't wear shorts - even in the summer - because Japanese men don't wear shorts. Call me old fashioned but I genuinely believe in ""when in Rome do as the Romans do"". It's how I show respect.

Caveats: I teach at St Andrews so you might well assume that I am biased; I can't speak about Maths; this is a sample size of 1.

As Admissions Officer I would strongly advise you to visit St Andrews if possible. It is quite different to other institutions; most people love it but some do not.

Pouring it on the ground: then being informed that they have to come up with a skit and that they only have hours at most while the HoC have had enough time to put together all kinds of additional aspects.

Fact: reality TV shows will twist, cut, and rearrange tape to produce the most drama, because that is what most viewers want. Do you disagree?  I can almost guarantee that the video was edited to put the Dr. Who girls in the worst light and HoC in the best. 

As far as the blogs truthfulness, yes I am assuming that, because I have known that woman most of my life and know her to be a very honest and truthful person. Nothing written from only one persons point of view can be completely unbiased and I know that, but I also know this woman is not prone to embellishments and can trust the bare bones of the story to be very close to the truth.

I am struggling to see how you see her expressing herself as elitism. You can't honestly say that if you were her you would appreciate the way they portrayed her on the show. In a honest straightforward competition she would have no problems loosing, this was anything but. 

Say you were getting ready to compete in a high school swim meet, you had practiced your butt off; freezing cold water, burning sun, whatever, you practiced every day. On the day of the meet you find out that Michael Phelps is coming to compete just to get some footage for a new commercial, never mind that this is just a high school meet. No way in hell are you going to win, not a chance. How would you feel? Instead of saying hey guys Phelps wants you to be in a commercial with him, then we will have our meet, you are forced to compete against an all star. it's not that you knew you were going to win, there were several other swimmers out there just as good or better than you, it's that they took away the dream, half the fun of something is the dream, the goal, and when they do something takes away from that dream or goal it's a little crushing.

That is one of the biggest problems we have in this world today when things are wrong or unfair no one stands up, because to do so would expose them to ridicule of the hive mind. 

It has nothing to do with being upstaged, it's about being outclassed, lets put a bicycle in a race with a Ferrari on a strait line track, maybe the bike will win!

true,Kesuke,null,null,"&gt; I know you think this 'oh the queen owns the oil' shtick is a cute way from the Westminster government to control Scotlands oil after independence

Far from it. What I am saying is that the ownership of the oil rests with teh crown estate. My supsicion is that they will actually encourage a fairly comparable split to what is currently the case - and you might be suprised but I suspect it will end up being in Scotlands interest... becasue the last thing the new Scottish nation needs is its biggest trading partner the UK plunged into a recession, simply because of a sudden shock like the removal of the oil wealth.

&gt; believe me its quickly fixed with a natural resources law

Yeah, natural resources law is a thing you just made up. Literally. It does.not.exist. As I've already said, international law is so misunderstood on reddit. It isn't really law in the domestic sense. Its a set of treaties. Enforcement of those treaties largely depends on being able to pressure countries into sticking with their treaty obligations, but there are hundreds of examples where nations don't maintain their treaty obligations (and are by extension technically in breach of 'international law'.) Yet no action is taken for all manner of reasons. I'm just saying, if you think the Scottish state can simply rock up at the UN with a lawyer and have it decided like that - it really isn't that simple. Considering possession is 9/10ths of the law, the fact most of the companies extracting the oil are registered in London is going to count for something.",0,1379531259,null,0,false,0,ccaxc3r,t3_1mktag,t1_ccaxc3r,t1_ccant9n,null,1429419542,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Suarez's return will be massive for mitigating the damage caused by losing Coutinho because he's able to do many of the most important things that Coutinho was doing (oh and he's also the best attacking player in the league, let's not forget that!).

For me, Suarez is the only other player we have who can really link play up during transitions.  He's perfectly capable of and completely willing to drop deeper to receive the ball when we move on the break, and his work ethic makes him able to preform the limited defensive responsibilities that Coutinho had just fine.  He's arguably better dribbling as well.  We lose some of Coutinho's vision but we gain an absolutely lethal, direct, and creative attacking threat in behind Sturridge.

I think every one definitely empathises with Northern Irish people, but they don't empathise with NIers much more than they do with Republican of Irelanders. NI is seen as being more similar to the Republican that it is to England, Scotland or Wales. That doesn't mean you're different.

Which is incorrect. They own the seabed. Not necessarily the mineral resources beneath it.

&gt;Yeah, natural resources law is a thing you just made up.

*cough, cough*

""Mineral estates are often severed from the surface estate. Such severance is accomplished with a conveyance or reservation of these rights. This conveyance or reservation includes minerals or substances considered to be minerals. Mineral rights do include hydrocarbon resources such as oil and natural gas, which are technically not minerals, because a mineral is formally a naturally occurring crystalline ""solid"". But nonetheless, legal regimes typically lump them together under this one term. Such a conveyance or reservation includes royalties, bonuses and rentals.""

and it just gets worse for you:

""When it comes to property rights, the United States is special. As an individual, Americans are guaranteed the right to own the minerals beneath the land. No other country allows its citizens to own the minerals beneath the land.""

From the freakin' wiki page on mineral rights.

&gt;As I've already said, international law is so misunderstood on reddit

Its so incredibly misunderstood that *you think I'm actually talking about international law*. I'm not. I'm talking about individual internal laws of countries. Some countries say you own the mineral resources if you own the land, some countries don't.

I'm guessing you know very little about natural resource exploitation?

Did some more searching AND: 

""Ownership of oil and gas within the land area of Great Britain was vested in the Crown by the Petroleum (Production) Act 1934. The Continental Shelf Act 1964 applied the provisions of the 1934 Act to the UKCS outside territorial waters.""

Basically the crown estate only has any say because of an act of parliament. Oh whats that? The Scottish parliament just passed another act giving the Scottish state control? Oh dear. How terrible.

The continental shelf is an asset of the crown estate - even an independent Scotland intends to maintain the monarchy. My guess, as I said above, is that this situation will probably used to maintain a roughly comparable split of oil profits as to what each nation currently recieves. That will be the mutually least damaging option.

Noting your comments and a complete lack of any sources to back up your claims I would say you understand very little about how national resource extraction works.

Governments earn revenue of natural resource in two ways: royalties and taxes. The first one is straightforward. If companies are trying to avoid paying tax on their profits of Scottish oil and the government wishes to stop them it can very easily pass a law to prevent them from domiciling those profits in London.

&gt;The continental shelf is an asset of the crown estate

Again you just repeat yourself and again you completely miss the point. Owning a piece of real estate does *not* give the owner the rights to the natural resources below that real estate. The crown estate has those rights through an act of parliament which can very easily be rewritten by an independent Scottish government.

&gt;My guess, as I said above, is that this situation will probably used to maintain a roughly comparable split of oil profits as to what each nation currently recieves

Then I would love to have whatever you are smoking. There is 0 chance of an independent Scotland giving a portion of oil its oil revenues to England. Your misunderstanding of natural resource extraction is embarrassing.

&gt;I'm not going to get sucked into a deep thought exercise with you where we explore every avenue of the oils future... 

Because you are completely unable to. You've been shown very clearly that even if the crown estate has some control over Scotland's oil that control can be taken away very quickly.

&gt;that ownership of the oil is not straightforward.

It is very straightforward. If the crown estate causes too much of an issue governments have this wonderful little tool called *eminent domain*.

&gt;Just like everything else about independence, the SNP present fiction as if it were fact.

No. We were intimidated, mad, jealous - all of it.

Guardian - left wing
Telegraph - right wing

Both of these show their bias in their editorials and their choice of what to cover. However both decent papers as long as you understand their political allegiance. 

One of the best ones is, imo, The Economist. The Economist is clear in what they believe, which is a sort of right wing libertarianism but mostly they're pragmatic. They supported intervention against Syria but not in Iraq. They supported the bank bailout but think more penalties should have been imposed on those bankers. Facts trump ideology in their world. They're also quite willing to concede when their editorial line is for a less than perfect solution. They backed Obama but with heavy reservations and were complimentary towards Romney in a media landscape (in the UK at least) that was otherwise hostile to him. 

However regardless of their own position they don't let it impact on the stories they write about or how they write about them. They make it clear what their position is 'this paper supports...' but they present the argument from both sides in a clear, emotionless but nonetheless interesting way. It's immune from sensationalism and it's weekly format makes them more considered than reactive to the events they cover. 

You come away from their reporting feeling much more informed whether you agree with their position or not. They can convince you of the argument from the other side to that you believe and even they believe. Yet best of all it's hardly ever is hostile to the otherside. It encourages understanding and mature debate instead of the hysterical polarization that other outlets promote.

I've lived in a high rise (6th floor on a 30 floor) 10-year old apartment. I've lived in a 10-year old block of flats (1st floor of a 4 floor building). I've lived in a 100-year old London maisonnette (3rd floor of a 4 floor terrace). And more.

In *every block* I've *always* suffered from at least one uncomfortably noisy neighbour. Or foreign strong cooking smells that overpowered my apartment for hours on a regular basis. Collective rubbish bins that the council would refuse to empty because some people were putting the wrong things in. Parking issues.

Apartment living should be ideal. It should be convenient - being closer to amenities, better security. I love the idea of apartments.

But the *reality* of living in apartments has not lived up to the promises. And the problem is essentially *other people*. I think Western cultures place too much importance on self-centredness and not enough on assimilation/consideration. Any time you dare suggest a neighbour change their behaviour because it is bothering you and you'll get laughed at or threatened. And that's sad.

true,paleogirl,mccoy,McCoy,"&gt; I'm in class right now, thanks to college, but I'll tell you a few things immediately and then search for some blogs later that illustrate it in better detail than I can.

I look forward to it. I'm stuck at my 9-5 drone receptionist job and it's absolutely dead here today. Even though the argument is mildly contentious, I'm deeply appreciative of having something interesting to keep my brain from melting of boredom. :-)

&gt; He yelled at River because she was forced into the horrible situation of breaking her own wrist. WTF? That's not the Doctor we all know and care about. At the very least, we don't want to go back to the days of Six with even worse writing and nastier behavior.

He yelled at River because he had just learned that he was destined to lose Amy at the end of the current adventure, and he was freaking out. Worth remembering that not fifteen minutes later, she slapped him for fixing her wrist with regeneration energy, which is certainly worse behavior than shouting. Speaking as a married person (15 years and counting), married people fight sometimes.

Is Eleven shouting ""Get your wrist out. You get your wrist out without breaking it!"" really somehow worse than the following exchange from Father's Day?

ROSE: Can't do anything right, can I? 

DOCTOR: Since you ask, no. So, don't touch the baby. 

ROSE: I'm not stupid. 

DOCTOR: You could have fooled me. 

Or Ten trying to humiliate Mickey in front of Rose and Sarah Jane in School Reunion?

MICKEY: Sorry! Sorry, it was only me. You told me to investigate, so I started looking through some of these cupboards and all of these fell on me.
 
ROSE: Oh, my God, they're rats. Dozens of rats. Vacuum packed rats.
 
DOCTOR: And you decided to scream. 

MICKEY: It took me by surprise! 

DOCTOR: Like a little girl? 

MICKEY: It was dark! I was covered in rats! 

DOCTOR: Nine, maybe ten years old. I'm seeing pigtails, frilly skirt.

There are many other examples of the Doctor being unthinkingly cruel to someone. The TATM example, in particular, didn't bother me in the least, because a) it implied that the Doctor thought River was smart and resourceful enough that she might legitimately come up with a solution that he couldn't see, and b) his guilt and chagrin upon realizing that she hadn't was obvious and beautifully acted.

Finally, I agree that some (but not all) of the writing from Six's era was appalling. Some of it was actually pretty good. But I love Colin Baker, and I love the Sixth Doctor. If you ever have the urge, check out some of his work for [Big Finish](http://www.bigfinish.com/ranges/all_reverse/monthly-series?filter%5B1%5D=6+-+Sixth&amp;filter%5B2%5D=&amp;filter%5B3%5D=Evelyn+Smythe&amp;filter%5B12%5D=&amp;free_search=&amp;release_number=&amp;release_start_month=&amp;release_start_year=&amp;release_end_month=&amp;release_end_year=).

&gt; Moffat in general has a hard time not sexualizing his female characters all the while letting them have their own agency. 

Why is that bad? The vast majority of women I know are sexual, and have their own agency in most areas of their lives. He's even pretty inclusive, with a committed lesbian married couple, and the implication that Clara is bisexual.

&gt; He essentially gave the OK for the doctor to blame Amy for wearing a skirt rather than question his own brilliant judgment of making a glass floor. 

I can't get too up in arms about a comedy sketch. If you honestly came away from the minisodes thinking that The Eleventh Doctor seriously expected Amy to go to her room, change into trousers, and never wear a short skirt again, then I can see why it would be problematic. Fortunately for feminists everywhere, succeeding episodes show pretty clearly that that never happened.

Also, in Eleven's defense, he *did* yell at Rory for looking first. :-)

&gt; Before he was promoted, he always pushed Rose to the back and made shallow love stories out of likes of Ten and Reinette, most notably. 

Moffat wrote three episodes with Rose, and Rose is front and center in two of them. In fact, I'd have the The Doctor Dances in particular would be a Nine/Rose shipper's dream! (Jack certainly seemed to be shipping them liek whoa...)

&gt; She has nothing to live for except the Doctor and waited forty something years for him.

Series Two was slim pickings for me, and while I'd put GitF in the top two or three eps, it's probably my least favorite Moffat ep. Everyone knows that Mme du Pompadour was way too busy chillaxing with the King and Queen of France, designing schools and factories, and taking time now and then for little things like helping out with the Treaty of Versailles to have actually spent very much time pining after the Doctor. So the letter at the end is certainly some fairly transparent ""fridging"", which is icky. I personally struggle with fridging because I *like* it when stuff happens that makes the main character show emotion. It's just a pity that 90% of the time, the main character is male and the fridged character is female.

&gt; And they met when she was a child which is a creepy plot device that Moffat loves abusing btw, even the seemingly harmless remark right at the end of that two parter he wrote about The Empty Child. He essentially wrote in the line about Nine giving Rose a red bicycle for her twelfth Christmas. Ew. And Amy and Clara being kids too.

I have never understood this complaint, and I don't think I ever will. Adult men are actually allowed to interact with children. Even female children. In what way could Nine sneaking in to give 12-year-old Rose a bicycle for Christmas when her family was poor *conceivably* be viewed as anything other than charming and sweet?

The Eleventh Hour without little Amelia would have been a bleak thing indeed-- hell, I'd sign up for a channel that showed nothing but Matt Smith in-character, interacting with kids all day long. And when Ten met Young Reinette, I actually didn't feel the urge to kick him in the teeth for a few minutes, which was an oddity during Series Two.

So is the argument supposed to be that the Doctor must be sexually molesting any female children he interacts with as soon as the camera cuts away? Because I just. Don't. Get it. For me, these are some of the highlights of the show. I get shivers whenever I rewatch Eleven's speech to little Amelia in The Big Bang. ""Live well. Love Rory. Bye bye, Pond."" The first time I saw that, I cried like a baby.

&gt; Anyway, compare this to the Titanic Christmas special where Astrid and Ten kiss, and when Joan kisses John Smith, they their relationships had much better depth and chemistry. And uh, just better writing in general.

To each their own! Voyage of the Damned did nothing for me except make me roll my eyes at David Tennant walking in slo-mo in front of an explosion and being borne aloft by robot angels. Astrid was sweet and plucky, just like the vast majority of Doctor Who heroines, but she was ultimately yet another fridged woman whose *raison d'etre* was to die and make the Doctor emo.

HN/FoB was a Paul Cornell story, and I do like Cornell. Joan/John Smith was very affecting, but didn't change the fact that Martha was scrubbing floors and fielding racist abuse from white teenagers down the hall. Loved the original novel; had mixed feelings about the TV adaptation.

&gt; Moffat is creepy, 

In what way? I've seen him in many interviews over the years, and he seems like a nice enough guy; well-spoken and intelligent.

&gt; he's sexist and the thought of a female doctor literally never even entered his head.

This seems unlikely, since he wrote the only televised female Doctor to date. Lumley for Thirteen!

&gt; Very surprising how you wrote an actually pretty compelling and hard hitting argument against Meta and Rose's relationship finds him a favorable writer. 

Why? As outlined in my last two posts, Moffat doesn't do the things that bother me about Doctor/Rose and Handy/Rose.

&gt; He just squicks me out.

No arguing with that! For what it's worth, the smart money says he's leaving after Series Eight. We'll probably get either Gatiss or Toby Whithouse at that point; both are workmanlike if not brilliant writers and showrunners.

&gt; Now I should get back to learning two point perspective lest I fall back in college work as I'm already doing and risk having to draw a naked Michael Jackson as my own punishment.

The situation currently is....

*ID SCAN EXPLAINED BY A USER I work at a venue using IDscan, and frankly it is a worry. Fortunately we are a decent bunch (by and large) however after playing with the system for a few minutes I managed to pull up a staggering amount of information on a customer that had been, very willingly, scanned into the system. Perhaps on the old presumption.. 'If I have nothing to hide, I have nothing to fear'. A very ignorant attitude adopted by big brother sympathisers. With a few touches I had the woman's Name, Age, DOB, Address with a googlemaps link, Place of birth, Star sign, email address and more. THAT, methinks, is something to hide.*

*How much of the data is shared? Well obviously some is for other machines to recognize the status of a barred id. And it is up to the user to determine the length and breath of the ban. For example I took an image of my genitalia and barred them within a hundred mile radius. Now any system that also sets its radius within my catchment area will be alerted to my meat and two veg being barred in Brixton for lewd conduct...*

*Shame as they are usually so well behaved unless they drink vodka.*

*Aside from that the guy who installed the system assured me that all the data is stored on site and should the police require a list of witnesses they can download the data manually by visiting the premises.*

*So the crime-fighting capabilities of these machines are potentially worthwhile. And since the system was installed we have seen and almost 100% drop in petty theft from the venue. Which is exactly what the system was installed to do. However we have had the odd bar fight, theft and bad behavior as can be expected from any establishment providing late night 'refreshment'. Although we have a list of everyone who was in the venue at the time of the incidents including the perps themselves. Not once have the police popped over to gather the intel. I'm not sure they even know how to.*

*The main use of these machines is a deterrent. And in that it succeeds. But that begs the question; If these things are a glorified scarecrow. Does this scarecrow need brains?*

I appreciate your story as well, but the big difference I can see is that you knew ahead of time (unless I am reading it wrong) they found out immediately before the competition, and had no time to compose themselves and come to the mind set you and your team did, which is wonderful by the way and a great stance to take, very mature for a group of highschoolers.

I am not raging against the HoC ""actors"" (whatever you wish to call them) themselves for the most par,t though to me, what I have seen and heard leads me to believe that one of them actually started the drama. The Dr. who girls were just trying to pack up and go home. 

I do agree that others need to leave the Hoc people out of it, but the people who decided to change it to a skit, either at the last minute or ahead of time and just not tell the other contestants, need to be told that that kind of behavior is not acceptable, it SHOULD be about level playing fields, even if that means creating another category. I don't believe that the show HoC is a good representation of what cosplay is all about and I most sincerely hope there is not another season. That was awesome of Chloe to be so supportive of other groups, that is more in keeping with the cosplay I know. I have no problems with them participating, everyone should be welcome, but I think if you continuously put amateurs up against professionals you are going to crush some dreams and perhaps stop someone who could someday be extraordinary. I was very pleased and surprised to find that they had won a category anyways, though I do dearly want to know what that producer said to the judges.

That is sometimes the problem with being the face of something, you get the hatred instead of those who deserve it. With them being the faces of HoC they are getting more flack than they deserve.

He is excellent defensively, but half of his defensive work is dropping into midfield and helping Gerrard to apply pressure.

The biggest overseas scholarship, the Clarendon Fund Scholarships used to be overseas only, but is now open to domestic students as well, so the competition is pretty stiff now.

I wasn't able to get any scholarships either from a British or Australian organisation, though in my case this consisted of applying to all of three scholarships to which I am eligible. I imagine as a Canadian you would have more domestic options (or not).

Right now I am paying my own way, and I am very fortunate to be in a position where I can do this comfortably (family support). My supervisor is trying to get me a research assistant position, either casual or full-time, so I can have some income.

There are also various scholarships from the colleges, they generally cover accommodation, i.e. they let you stay for free, and a few thousands pounds in spending money. You generally have to join that college if you get such a scholarship. This might be worth looking into.

My supervisor did mention there are lots of little scholarships from various organisations, and if you manage to get a few they can be substantial, but I haven't personally looked into this yet. From what I seen so far, it would be difficult for me to personally get anything being offered by a British organisation due to my overseas status. (So much for being in the Commonwealth!)

true,Rick_Heinegeber,null,null,"On television the BBC is my favourite. There is also ITV News and Channel 4 News that are both reputable. Channel 4 News is more alternative than those 2 and often presents a different view and highlights other stories.

In terms of print journalism: The Times, The Financial Times, The Independent, The Guardian, The Observer, The Telegraph are all reputable papers with proper journalism. As everyone has pointed out, there is an inbuilt bias - but only to a degree. It isn't flagrant, nor is it masked. I believe the journalism in all these papers to be fair and equal - to a satisfactory degree.

The Daily Mail is garbage - scaremongering, speculating, hate filled, backwards looking crap. It is sensationalist poison and should be treated as such. This is not a serious newspaper, although worryingly, it masquerades as one, and millions of people think that it is.

The Guardian is left leaning and I rather enjoy reading it most of the time. It is well presented and it provides an excellent level of coverage for different stories. It is a great newspaper. I dislike, however, some of their readership. There are some people, stereotypically, who just read the Guardian, and see it as part of a lifestyle which is alternative, against the mainstream, 'hipster' really. These kind of people can really get under my skin. I'm someone who consults several sources for news and views of current affairs before making up my own mind - to read one source and take it as fact is not only alien to me but jolly ignorant.

In the heat of the moment a lot of things were forgotten, including common courtesy on both sides, and I can guarantee you those producers were wringing their hands in glee at the material they were given.  I have actually read on several blogs that the words of the crowd heckler were dubbed over to make them worse than they were just to create more drama.

Isn't that a factor in pro VS amateur (boy am I glad you already had that spelled out in your post, spell check was NO help!), craftsmanship? And dreams are being squashed, I know you hold no sympathy, but the Dr Who crew will probably never wear their costumes again for fear of recognition and ridicule, and I very much doubt they enter another competition again. I have read on some posts about younger generations who have watched that episode and now have no desire to dress up or even go to a convention, something was squashed there as well.

Things will have to change way more drastically before it becomes a quality TV show (of which there are TOO FEW these days) They need to make it all about the build not all about the drama. Her blog post was designed to defend herself, the producers certainly weren't going to give her a chance. Also, is you find the origional post, in teh comments she further elaborates and does share remorse for the way she acted, one of the HoC girls even comments. 

I think lots of things would be better if we took the media out of it, this is one place where I feel media has little right to be, especially in the capacity that this show has presented it. Cons are designed to encourage people to get out and enjoy teh company of others, not to enjoy on the couch as to girls rip into each other about whether or not they belong. In fact, I think that a complete revamp or destruction of all current reality shows is in order, very little of what is portrayed on them is really what happens.
