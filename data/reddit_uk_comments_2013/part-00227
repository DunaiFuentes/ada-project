Reina had been poor by his standards for a while and even though I love the bloke, I was never truly devastated to see him go because I've seen how good Migs has been for the last 3 years at Sunderland every week when I watch them, and I always wanted Mig to replace Reina one day. There was no one else in my mind, I only wanted Migs.

With Agger I still think he has a lot to contribute to this team/squad. Also, it's been Reina's dream to play for Barca. Just like if I played professionally for Barca or Milan and then Liverpool came knocking...I'd be on the next plane to England.

The good news is, we don't concede many goals (that West Ham debacle notwithstanding). That's only half the battle, though. We do need to score more, and we need to LOOK to score more, from the manager right down to the strikers and mids. 

Don't get me wrong, I completely understand and appreciate how hard it is to integrate all this new blood and all these different languages, levels of experience, style, etc. I think AVB is doing an absolutely super job, but if he would get us focused a bit more, just a wee bit more, on the offensive side of the pitch, I would be so, so happy.

He is not going to learn his trade on the bench at Chelsea, and why move there to be on loan when you can play at your boyhood club. But then again, money talks.

Clearly neither has a case for actual self defence. 

If your life is at threat you can defend yourself and the public love a good story of a home owner defending themselves.

There are only a few states which view it as an addiction instead of a crime and send people to rehab or ""drug court""; instead it's ""They broke the law, lock them up"" and thus it continues the cycle of drug use, arrest, incarceration, release as they aren't given treatment and no one really cares.

There is a distinct lack of care for passengers.

Firstly, the data relating to train times is private and a licence must be commercially arranged to get access to it - that's information for the public - but not available to the public except through commercial companies that have paid for a licence.

Secondly, when things go wrong rail companies wash their hands of it - they are not interested in the suffering caused to thousands if not hundreds of thousands of passengers. They blame weather, National Rail, strikes, etc. They don't provide up-to-date information. They don't provide alternative travel arrangements.

Thirdly, passengers are not compensated. Oh, sure, *some* season tickets are reduced by a pathetic 5% if severe problems were experienced the month before - but no refunds for season ticket holders that are not purchasing another next month. And certainly no compensation to match the loss suffered by their passengers.

Obviously forcing passengers to stand on 30+ minute journeys is intolerable but somehow we've come to accept we spend 1st world money for 3rd world service.

The thing basically is already. We have Network Rail which are a public company for all intents and purposes doing most of the ""heavy lifting,"" the public also essentially owns the trains we rent out to the rail operators, and many of the stations too.    

So really the train operators are just needless middle-men. What is it they add in terms of ""value?"" They're told when to run trains. They're given the trains. They're given the tracks and stations. They're given most of the ticketing infrastructure. Are they really nothing more than an employment agency?      

I legitimately don't understand why it was privatised. The whole reason why private businesses work as a concept is **competition** but there is zero competition on the railways, the train operators don't even get to set ticket prices or when they run their trains, the government decides those things.

I've never seen any public service before and since that was hated so much by everyone who used it. 

In my experience I've only had one problem on the west coast mainline in the last few years and that was due to a tree on the line which caused a decent delay. Sometimes the trains have started to become crowded (only for first transpennine trains mind) but they announced they will be doubling the number of carriages on each train by 2014 so it seems acceptable. 

The only benefit of British Rail over current services was price. I'm not so sure the price would decrease much over privstised rail nowadays as I think they wouldn't be allowed to cut corners like they used to, with ancient carriages that always seemed like they wouldn't last the journey.

Actions like the apparently[ non existent threat to disrupt the Olympic opening ceremony](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23195283) that might have happened if it existed, that GCHQ took the credit for stopping, are not quantifiable.  They do not justify the expense spent on them.  There was no clear threat. If there is, publish the information about how many ""terrorist actions"" have been stopped and how many arrests this ultimately has lead to.  This might lead to less critisum and an understanding of why your actions and bugets might be justified.   

Whole scale snooping on its own citizens and helping other nations (looking at you America) do the same is not justifiable.  If there is just cause and this has been legally sanctioned, Yes, but not as we suspect its being done at the moment.  This type of action SHOULD be criticised. 

The UK's security services involvement in  in so-called ""extraordinary rendition"" How in any way is this justifiable in a civilised society? This type of action SHOULD be criticised.

It just goes on and on. The list of dubious actions the UK security services over the last 15 to 20 years is mammoth (I'm not going to list them here as I cant be arsed spending that long Goggling them). I do not have “lah-di-dah, airy-fairy” views on this. Many of these actions are immoral, illegal and just down right wrong. The responsibility for these actions ultimately stop with the government of the day. If the security services act in this manner the government of the day is complicit in their actions. I criticise you David Camaeron.  I criticise you and your cabinet for allowing these illegal and immoral actions to happen.

I'm biased against the lone striker, though.  I think a second striker, or at least another forward, pulls at defenses.  We need that now, especially since the reason we're not getting goals is because teams are defending with 10.  Start to force defenders to double up on 2 players, and suddenly there's more space for Eriksen, Holtby, Gylfi, Paulinho, Townsend, Lamela, Lennon to move and shoot.

Personally, I think a player like Ade is better suited to a center forward position in the squad we have.",0,1382972559,null,0,false,0,cd1cmvw,t3_1pdimx,t1_cd1cmvw,t3_1pdimx,null,1428954544,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

true,BrokenClockwerk,lfc50,,"Doubt it. Madrid are in the market for a striker. Benzema has been pretty unimpressive for Madrid (as far as Madrid standards go) and Arsenal and Chelsea are allegedly interested in him. If he goes, that leaves them without a striker.

The way I see it, Madrid would like a cheaper option after splurging on Bale, but they will accept a higher price for quality. They are looking for their tenth CL, and Suarez could be a major part in winning it. Furthermore, he's on the market. Sure, for silly money, technically everyone is on the market, but let's look at the top strikers around the world. Let's break it down into three criteria. First, the player must be young enough to hold down a spot for a few years. No sense buying a 30-31 year old star who could fail at any moment. Let's say 28 or younger. Second, the player must be able to handle pressure. A flash in the pan striker for a decent team, like Michu is for Swansea, is great, but the pressure for playing for RM is insane. Thirdly, availability. Transfer negotiations suck and I doubt anyone at RM wants another Levy situation. Overpaying is alright, but dragging out negotiations for months is unacceptable. A week for a want-away player is preferable to trying to pry away a club icon or local legend.

In the Premier League last season, we have Van Persie (too old), Bale (got him), Benteke and Michu (unproven at big clubs). This leaves Suarez.

In Serie A, we have Cavani (just moved), Di Natale (too old), Osvaldo (just moved) and El Shaarawy (will not want to leave).

In Bundesliga, we have Kiessling (too old), Lewandowski, Meier (too old), Ibisevic (too old) and Mandzukic (Bayern won't let him go, wouldn't want to leave).

In Ligue 1 we have Zlatan (too old), Aubemayang (just moved), Cvitanich (too old), and Gomis (not good enough)

In La Liga we have Messi (nope), Ronaldo (got him), Falcao (just moved), Negredo (just moved), and Soldado (just moved).

Of the top 25 or so strikers in Europe's top leagues last season, we can rule out almost all of them for moves to Madrid. Ruling Gomis out for inconsistency and being not great, we are left with Suarez and Lewandowski. Maybe Rooney, since he can score as well and is want-away. Lewandowski is allegedly set on Bayern, but let's say his head could be turned by RM.

Two, maybe three players (with Rooney) that fit the profile of established stars at big teams that are young enough to play for a few years, and didn't move this summer. If Rooney is happy with SAF gone, and Lewandowski IS really set on Bayern, that leaves Suarez. And, unfortunately, if RM wants a player, they will get him. We held off a summer, like SAF held onto Ronaldo for a season, but Suarez will be gone next season.",0,1382973694,null,0,false,0,cd1d13n,t3_1pdi62,t1_cd1d13n,t3_1pdi62,null,1428954360,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8

http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?c=uk&amp;v=26

Says 9.33 deaths per thousand per year.  ~~So in 63.23 million people, that's 18 deaths per day.~~

---

Edit: See below, my maths was very badly wrong.  It's 580605.90/365.25 = 1589 deaths per day.  Which only makes my point stronger.  2 deaths is not a significant number of deaths in an event that affected a nation.",0,1382974092,null,0,1382988670,0,cd1d67y,t3_1pdr7u,t1_cd1d67y,t1_cd1bo77,null,1428954294,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

It's not just the suicides that are of concern. How many died simply as a result of the extreme stress?

I think in order to make it work, you'd have to play Townsend and Lennon on the wings, preferably their dominant foot side, and then your center mids would would have to either make it a flat midfield or a diamond.  I think Sandro/Eriksen could be a good pairing, provided that Lennon and Townsend track back, but it would still be not as solid defensively as we are now.  

If you went with a flat center mid pairing, probably Sandro and Paulinho.  That leaves most of the creative burden wide, and on Adebayor in the center.  Not a huge fan of that idea.

One other option would be more of a 4-3-1-2, instead of some variation of a 4-4-2.  

Paulinho - Sandro - Mousa

Eriksen 

Soldado - Adebayor

If you put them ahead of the back four, and task Walker and Rose with getting forward to provide width, it could work.

You seem to have fallen for it, as did so many others.

As for lateness this is due to different strategies. Current rail companies are fined if their trains are late, so if one train becomes delayed then all those behind it will also, meaning a cascade of late fines. This results in the first train being cancelled outright (no fine) to prevent the later trains from all becoming late, saving the companies money. This strategy results in fewer people being late overall, but can massively inconvenience the people on the train which gets cancelled, especially if it leaves service at a middle of nowhere station. BR's strategy was the opposite, they would have rathered all trains be 5 mins late than one of them being cancelled. More people mildly inconvenienced but everyone got where they had to go.

The guy has been responsible for the government selling off some of its stake, at a profit.  Despite the massive unloading of shares values haven't dropped.

It is cutting back, cutting jobs now in many was as a direct result of the merger and now spinning out of TSB.

I would be extremely surprised, but will accept I am wrong, if the combined costs of tickets + subsidy makes our system significantly less financed than the French one per passenger.

If a private company is receiving a subsidy, and still vastly more expensive than other nationalised companies in Europe, it is showing that private rail simply can not compete in this area and perhaps should be renationalised for the good of the customers, not businessmen - perhaps if that profit margin was cut out, and the ludicrous overhead costs of franchising in terms integrated IT systems, shared stations etc, costs of the tender process (all those dinners get billed to someone), we might actually have a reasonable system that costs a reasonable amount.",0,1382977184,null,0,false,0,cd1ecsr,t3_1pdq2m,t1_cd1ecsr,t1_cd1e553,null,1428953742,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

They're basically two people who share an office building.

If every barrister in [Temple, Lincoln's Inn and Gray's Inn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inns_of_Court#History_and_composition) shared a single building, they wouldn't fill a mid-sized modern tower block.

This is a historic area of London, where lawyers have been practising for hundreds of years. It's close to the high courts and the barristers there apprentice other barristers, perpetuating the cliquishness. 

As I understand it, a ""chambers"" is a single [house / office building](http://i.imgur.com/TmUfahG.jpg) in which the barristers share a clerk (i.e. a secretary / administrator) and photocopying costs. As I understand it, each barrister is self-employed, and I would guess there's co-operative ownership of some sort, so that everyone chips in for rent and expenses.

So it's quite possible that David Cameron had met Brooks' defence lawyer - it seems likely to imagine they might both have attended a dinner party or whatever at Dave's brother's house.

However, there's no reason to suspect a conspiracy based on this. After all, it's already well established that David Cameron knows the accused, and even rode her police-horse (retired).

This is a *knows someone who knows someone* level of coincidence - considering the size of the London community of barristers, someone is defended at the Old Bailey every day by someone who knows someone who works in David Cameron's brother.

The effectiveness of a transport system is also not a zero sum game, there are also arguments that a more effective transport system could aid the economy and thus increase tax receipts.

It may be seen as unfair by those who don't use the trains, but there are plenty of things taxation is spent on which is not actually used by everybody.

I'm not advocating it, just at least saying it's worth a thought because the current system seems incredibly unfair to the passengers; they pay the subsidy via their taxes and then the exorbitant ticket prices on top of it.

I think in the preseason build up fans got a bit too excited about his present prospects because we had ourselves a young Brazilian #10: something that tends to mean you're going to be pushing on as a club.

He still isn't there yet. Sturridge is more explosive and more important right now.

I think what we've seen from Hendo through the middle since we went to the 5-3-2 (there's a more accurate number but it went on for too long), is that with runners up top and from wingback he can do a very good job picking passes. He's not fucking Coutinho and doesn't do that job when he's in, but him, Gerrard, and Lucas proved fairly capable of finding people at the right time and in good positions.

When we bring Coutinho back in I think we can move to a 4-2-3-1 (again, lots of fluid movement make it harder to quantify that but its roughly correct), and drop a CD. Does it make sense when we've used the formation so well? I think it does. Sure, there are selection headaches at a time when we don't have enough games to get every proper time, but that's a good thing for the club.

Its a burden on Rodgers to satisfy all our talented and frankly in demand CBs, but hopefully they see the bigger picture. 

I also think we can adjust game to game with our formation. If a game is won we can go into the 5-3-2 and I expect we will.

Lennon starting on the left yesterday is one of the manager's more baffling decisions since coming to the club IMO. He has 3 players who more naturally and effectively play on that side.

I really like Azza and wouldn't mind starting him on the right in certain games but he has NEVER been good on the left. Even if he doesn't want to play Lamela yet, Chadli and Sigurdsson are both better left-sided players than Lennon. 

The nice thing is we're still picking up sloppy / lucky / scrappy points even as we're fucking around with different combinations of players. Our defense is very settled and better than I've ever seen it. Later in this season and indeed into the future we should have a very good side. We've played a tougher schedule than LFC and Arsenal, we've been in worse form, and we've still about matched their points. 

So in spite of all the doom in gloom (after a win against a side who have played well in big matches this season, hilariously enough) we're in a pretty good position IMO. 

I'm actually looking forward to the Everton game. I think Lukaku will abuse us if Chiriches and Dawson play together again, but Everton like to play with the ball and that suits us.

For other NFL fans, I always think back to when Ryan Leaf and Peyton Manning were drafted. Manning and leaf were outrageously gifted rookies who both could have been All World talent. 

The difference between the two came with how their respective clubs handled them after the draft. Peyton had tons of support from the club in getting situated as well as clear guidelines on what it took to be successful (planned out his entire week should he choose to work)

Ryan was given nothing. The Chargers basically just drafted him and left him on his own. He received close to 0 support or direction from the team. The end result being Ryan fizzled out. 

This was actually a deciding factor for Eli, Peyton's little brother, when he was drafted into the league. Peyton and Ryan kept close contact as rookie and Peyton was fully aware of what Eli would be walking into which caused Eli to hold out for a better situation. 


The point of this is, I really hope that the team is giving Lamela the support structure and direction that a young kid like that needs. It does not take much to do long term damage to a young athlete's career. It could be the difference between another Gareth Bale or another Jenas.

Does LFC have a good shot at being in CL next year? Yes. Do they have a shot at winning the PL this year? Maybe. Are the reds going to enter CL and be able to compete against the likes of Real, Barca, Bayern, etc.? No, and probably not for awhile.

You can't expect Luis (given how good he is) to use up his best years playing for a team that doesn't have a realistic shot at a European Cup.

Best hope is that we can get some of that Bale money and reinvest it for the future.

Overall, good article; glad to hear that the club are working to fix things, but ultimately, their hands are tied by money. I look at my favorite hockey team (the Toronto Maple Leafs) and they're in a similar situation; there's so much demand for tickets, that the entire lower bowl of their arena is filled with old people in suits who are there ""to say they're there"", rather than because they love hockey or Toronto, and the atmosphere suffers as a result.

I think the #1 thing that Spurs can do is legitimize, officially recognize in some fashion, a supporters club like the 1882 movement, and start giving those organizations, who pledge to keep the noise level up, good seats at fair prices; You could make it so those tickets could not be resold, and hold the leaders of those fan groups accountable for making sure those tickets stay within that group. If we do that with maybe 4 sections in the lower bowl, that will improve the atmosphere enormously, I think. But Tottenham has to buy into (much the way Bayern did) not being able to charge super high prices to supporters groups; trade a little money at the gate to make sure that supporters will always be there to make the Lane a great place to play.

Sometimes it's impossible to be sure someone's committed a crime, even if you're inclined to believe the person claiming to be their victim. 

Sometimes you simply can't be sure the accusation is malicious.

You're basically advocating for jailing the victim any time anyone gets away with rape. 

We already have laws against perjury and against wasting police time, and we already enforce those against false accusers when it's proven to be blatant or malicious.

Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if we had a better conviction rate against false accusations than we do against actual rape, seeing as how a false accusation has to involve the police, how contradictions in the story will be recorded on tape during multiple interviews and how the accuser will be cross-examined by a barrister on the witness stand.

Your knee-jerk reaction against accusers is nearly as bad as the knee-jerk against this Iranian guy. 

Since you're scrapping the principle of reasonable doubt, do you want innocent people put in prison, or do you want rape victims to be unable to come forward, because they fear being put in jail merely for reporting a crime to the police?",0,1382986133,null,0,false,0,cd1i0k5,t3_1pdxmf,t1_cd1i0k5,t1_cd1faky,null,1428951913,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

&gt;Although on that note, it is now around 12 hours since the storm passed and in London train services are still majorly impacted. Network Rail can't control the weather but they can control the speed and efficiency of their cleanup response. Today - as per usual - shows how little speed and efficiency they possess.

I think this displays a thorough ignorance of the way the railways work. Its a system that has to deal with 24,000 trains per day. Not only does it have to run passengers on time, but assets like rolling stock and staff have to arrive at the right place at the right time. As a result when it works, it works very very well. If something happens (OH GEE I WONDER WHAT THAT COULD BE) to knock this system out of synch then delays propagate through the system and they are very difficult to pick up.

There was a fantastic AMA (I think - might have just been a comment) by a train driver in the last couple of months that outlined how this works. Simply put, if like today things are sufficiently delayed then the rolling stock that should be at point A is somewhere near point D and the driver is somewhere on a delayed train around point B.",0,1382987751,null,0,false,0,cd1ipqu,t3_1pdq2m,t1_cd1ipqu,t1_cd1i2d9,null,1428951586,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Until Dunblane, pistol target shooting was a perfectly legitimate hobby. Just like it had been a perfectly legitimate hobby to shoot military rifles before Hungerford. 

Take it from someone who was alive back then - many people, if not most, upon learning that someone was a target shooter would react no more strongly than to say ""cool, that's an unusual hobby"". Just as they do if you tell them you're an airgun or bolt-action target shooter today.

We have lots of stupid knee-jerk laws, and you're wearing tinted glasses if you believe otherwise.

I'm not saying that our gun laws are wrong, but these school shootings gave a political mandate to pass bans.

The resulting fall in gun crime is mostly attributable to the reduced supply of arms to criminals and gangs, a totally different group from the nutters who perpetrated the spree shootings. 

I was shocked to see a semi-auto pistol tucked into a guy's waistband when he was stood at the bar, reaching for his wallet to pay his tab, when I was sat in a pub in Sofia, Bulgaria some years ago.

true,buried_treasure,null,null,"In the decades following the end of the Second World War, the United Kingdom had to essentially rebuild much of its national infrastructure from scratch. On top of that, there was a huge Government investment in welfare services, in particular the creation of the NHS.

All of this required large amounts of labour, and post-War Britain just didn't have enough people to fill all the vacancies. So a major campaign was launched to encourage Commonwealth citizens to immigrate to the UK -- this was encapsulated in the [British Nationality Act 1948](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Nationality_Act_1948) which pretty much gave British citizenship to any Commonwealth citizen who wanted to move here. Although by far the largest group to take advantage of this law were people from the Caribbean, it applied equally to other Commonwealth countries including Canada.

In part due to increasing public concern about immigration the Government introduced a slight change to the law in the early 1970s which meant that Commonwealth citizens needed to show some kind of family link to the UK before they could come here ([Immigration Act 1971](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_1971)). Again, this theoretically applied equally to all Commonwealth citizens but the reality was that it was far more likely that a white person in Canada or Australia would be able to demonstrate British ancestry than a black person in Jamaica.

The really big change occurred in the early 1980s when  a new [British Nationality Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Nationality_Act_1981) was brought in. Again, this was largely down to concerns over large-scale immigration, this time partly triggered by an influx of Asians who had come to the UK after being expelled from Idi Amin's Uganda in the early 1970s. The new law swept away the concept of Commonwealth Citizen, removed the clause that allowed any person born on UK soil to automatically be a British citizen, and meant that non-British persons had to show a very strong family link to the UK (basically have a British parent or grandparent) before they could apply for UK citizenship.

It frustrates me when these types are pushed through too early, it can ruin a career so easily, most fans don't realise -- something I'm very worried about Sterling right now. The good thing is our current set up couldn't be much better for the progression of our youth players. I look at the likes of Rodolfo Borrell, Alex Inglethorpe and the newly acquainted Neil Critchley along with Brendan Rodgers, with his large history in youth football, and have confidence a lot of our talented lads will make it.

One last point, a brilliant - and arguably most important - side of the way we're developing our youth products is how we're developing them mentally. Borrell and McParland always talk about how we're not teaching them as players, but also as people. This, more than anything else, makes me happiest.

We don't have any tall players that are going to convert a high number of chances but when teams play so deep that means we can at least get numbers in the box. One is bound to go in sooner or later. Especially if we can cross from deep where the forwards can simply run onto the ball instead of outjumping the defender. That's what Townsend's goal against AV was. He didn't get to the byline, he just played it in behind the defense.

I like the possession game we play. But it's not very dynamic at the moment. It seems like we play like we're scared of losing the ball and that's why we don't cross, because we might lose the ball. But if we cross, what will happen? The defense either heads it clear and Sandro wins possession back or the keeper claims it and kicks it long and the CDs win it back and 2 minutes later the other team is defending again. 

Once we get the first goal the other team has to come out and face us and that's where we can really be devastating. That's why our matches are so tense.

This is assuming the wealthy person spends all of their money on domestic consumer spending. They will not. A high proportion of the revenues of the wealthy is exported, or spent in some other form which is hard to tax. Relative to their incomes, wealthy people consume VASTLY less than poor people. They may spend more overall, but poorer people spend vastly larger proportion of their incomes on domestic consumption.

Obviously you can argue that the untaxed 4 million that was put into consumption would later be taxed in some form. This is dubious.

Some train operating companies own their stock. The rest is leased from private companies.

Yes they do. From 2014 they can increase prices by up to 6.1%

In the case of pedestrianisation for the Triangle, a solid case will need to be assembled to show that (at least and not limited to):

1 - Pedestrianisation will not add to congestion in other areas of the city and will not require unreasonable investment in areas leading to (and located near) the proposed pedestrianisation.

2 - Pedestrianisation will not negatively effect footfall/passing business figures for local businesses.

3 - The cost of investment in proposed changes will result in either a positive economic benefit to local businesses and/or a substantial, positive benefit to local living standards (including environmental factors) within a reasonable period.

4 - Pedestrianisation can be implemented with minimal effect on logistical factors relating to local businesses and dwellings, including access for emergency services

No doubt, there will be winners and losers regardless of how solid a plan for pedestrianisation within the Triangle is. Aside from the points mentioned above (and within the points themselves) there will be many questions that will need to be answered, some without full knowledge of what pedestrianisation may bring.

true,Dubzoid,null,null,"1. As far as I can tell it seems like no one knows the full story. For a while he seemed dedicated to the team, and making it better. However, as the summer went on it seemed to be leaning more towards Bale wanting to leave. By the way, it wasn't a typical trade as we're used to from American sports, it was a transfer. Real Madrid gave us a shit ton of money, and we gave them Bale, but we didn't get players in return. As for opinions on him, I think mine and a lot of others' opinions can be summed up like this: we're thankful for what he did and hope he does well, but fuck Real hard.  
  
2. This is tough to answer because we have a lot of very good young players. The top contenders are Townsend, Lamela, Eriksen, and Holtby IMO. Out of these, Townsend and Lamela probably fit the Bale role much better, since the other two are more creative players than they are finishers. While we brought Lamela in for a lot of money, we haven't seen much of him so it's hard to compare the two. Both have been considered possible replacements for Bale in the future.  
  
3. It depends on what you're looking for. If you want someone that's been with the team for a while, pick Dawson, Lennon, or Defoe. If you want a team of the season caliber player, pick Vertonghen. If you want arguably the best keeper in the league, pick Lloris. If you want a player that will be on the pitch nearly every game, pick Paulinho. If you want a creator, pick Holtby or Eriksen. If you want a young, fast, explosive winger, pick Townsend or Lamela. If you want our main striker, pick Soldado. It really depends on what means the most to you when picking a jersey. I didn't even mention nationality or just what player you like the most, and there are still a ton of reasons to pick. I would definitely recommend picking a player since you're in the states, though. Most people are used to that and could be confused if there isn't a player. I personally picked Vertonghen because he's a beast defender with the ability to go forward, loves the club, and plays non-stop. Like I said though, that's completely up to you.  
  
4. It's just not like the ""New York Yankees"" or other teams here. It's not the typical format that we're used to.

true,jakuba95,flair8,,"1. Nobody really knows, but the general consensus is that we initially wanted to keep Bale and build a team around him (as he was our best player) and it did seem that he did want to stay. But Real Madrid turned his head in a quite unsavory manner (like having their players and staff like Zidane saying Bale should leave us for them) all this before a bid was made. And even at the point a bid was made there was still hope he would stay. But when he made it clear he wanted to leave, we made the decision to let him go despite us being able to keep him if we really wanted to. All in all it was not the most gracious but i'd say we have a soft spot for Bale but hate Real Madrid for turning him.

2. It could anyone from a list that is really too long to type up but right now Andros Townsend and Erik Lamela are the two that have been earmarked to specifically inherit Bale's mantle. In terms of players that are going to be very good the first player you should know about is Tommy Carroll. He is a centre mid from the academy on loan at QPR in the league below ours, he has extremely high potential and holds a bit of cult status to Spurs fans. Players in the first team picture right now though include the aforementioned Townsend and Lamela (both wingers), Lewis Holtby (midfield) and Christian Eriksen (attacking midfield).

3. It comes down to preference i'd say, probably watch a couple of games hopefully see as many players as you can, and decide which players you like (playing style, appearance, name, mentality etc). A blank one is always a good shout as its timeless so if the player transfers its still valid. But not to discourage you if you really like a player just go for it.

4. This is one i'm not too sure about. I have always thought that we have never really been called Hotspurs and it just has connotations of being a bit of a bandwagoner who barely follows the team and just likes being associated with the name of the team like ""my favourite football team? oh yeah I love the Tottenham Hotspurs"".",0,1382994384,null,0,false,0,cd1lldk,t3_1peuza,t1_cd1lldk,t3_1peuza,null,1428950231,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

1. It's not exactly a secret that Gareth requested the transfer. In the end I suppose it was more or less ""mutual"", as we got an insane amount of money for him. The fanbase is split, I miss him personally, and definitely still like him ( [This video brings tears to my eyes when I watch it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHsIzHLctgI) )

2. It's impossible to say who the next one will be, you can't really look at it from that perspective. We have and have had amazing players amongst our ranks, and every now and then there are stand-outs. In recent times it's been Gareth Bale and Luka Modric. As for the future, it's difficult to predict. In our current roster, Hugo Lloris (goalkeeper) is without a doubt one of the best players in his position worldwide, while Jan Vertonghen (centreback) made the Premier League 2012-2013 Team of the Season. The general consensus among the fans is that Sandro (central/defensive midfielder) who just returned from injury is an absolute monster, who certainly has the potential to be amongst the most effective deep-lying midfielders in the world. 

3. Whoever you like. Watch a few games and get a feel for it. Some people prefer offensive players, some people prefer defensive players. Michael Dawson is the captain, so you can't really go wrong with him. I'd also suggest Sandro, because aside from being a great midfielder, his antics and passion has made him a fan favourite. But at the end of the day, the choice is yours.

4. In short, the name ""Hotspur"" comes from a Shakespeare character named Harry Hotspur who is based on an English aristocrat from the Tottenham area. Since it's a name, it doesn't really make sense calling us ""the Hotspurs"". It's either Tottenham Hotspur or just Spurs.

The other routes possible (going via St Michaels Hill or onto the A4) for example, for my journey from Clifton Down to Cabot Circus, are already heavily congested, particularly in peak times, and would simply not be able to handle the extra load of traffic. Whiteladies road effectively becomes a dead end, rather than being a trunk road through the centre of Redland/Clifton and a link from Westbury and beyond. 

People travelling from that area, or the like would now be forced to use the already problematic A38 or A4, rather than having a more direct and central option. 

I could go on and on, but the triangle area is far, far to critical to ever be pedestrianised as it simply links many many areas.

true,WheelsOnTheBike,null,null,"It's interesting you see it as an attack on cars, I see it more of a defence!

As you say, there's too many cars. This causes problems for anyone who wants an alternative, as the council treats vehicle flow as the priority, so as a result alternatives are made too inconvenient, unpleasant, or even dangerous. 

This exacerbates the problem. Cars are now the easiest safest way to get around, leading to more cars. It's a positive feedback loop that we're already deep in.

It's a difficult problem that is far beyond what this scheme that I drew up in my bedroom. I see two outcomes. Either we keep on maintaining the number of vehicles, inherently worsening the problem, or we tackle the problem directly and balance the roads so they're not entirely for cars.

true,BigRedS,cnty-uk,London,"&gt; That's kind of what's so fascinating to me. It's like there's a cultural 'blind spot' in the UK that guns can be profoundly effective for self-defense. Most of the rest of the world understands that, but to your worldview it just isn't 'real' inside of your ('bermuda triangle'?) borders.

I think we just don't consider the sort of threat against which a firearm is an effective implement of self-defence to be a credible one, generally. As far as I am aware I don't know anybody who, while in the mainland UK, has felt that a firearm would add significantly to their protection at any point. There's all sorts of things that we might protect ourselves against since it's possible to, but we don't feel it's worth the hassle given the relatively low chance of our need for that protection, and firearms fit into that category.

Here it often looks weird to see that in the US there's a lot of people who have firearms for self-defence but have never had to use them to defend themselves. To you (or them) that's probably simply reassuring - even if you never intend to need to use it, one day you might and that's reason enough to have it, but it's a position that not many people here hold - we'd generally like to try to defuse the hypothetical situation.

It probably helps that we've traditionally had two sorts of gun owners - soldiers and the aristocracy. Firearms are, therefore, generally to be used for sport or for warfare. Sport shooting seems generally better received than the idea of routinely-armed police, for instance.",0,1382997577,null,0,false,0,cd1mx9j,t3_1pbt8v,t1_cd1mx9j,t1_cd1mhl4,null,1428949610,48,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,48

- Tipping terrorists off that they are no longer being monitored

...

or would it? I think last week against Aston Villa, AVB played a masterstroke by playing a bit less attack-minded and a considerably less flashy side in replacing Dembele with Sandro and Eriksen with Holtby.  In my mind, part of the reasoning of this was to give the other team a false sense that they don't need to park the bus against us.  And if Eriksen isn't on the field, they can't double team him.  Holtby and Sandro are certainly capable, but against an inferior side it did seem a bit of a surprise at the time that they got the start. It didn't work this past weekend, because nothing was going to keep Hull from parking the bus.

true,Ardal,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"You make a number of bollox statements here and provide absolutely no evidence to support them.

 
The public don't own the trains at all, rolling stock is owned by ROSCO's such as porterbrook (owned by consortium including DB rail &amp; BNP Paribas) Angel (private equity investors) and Eversholt (consortium including Morgan Stanley) There are also others operating on a smaller scale such as Soverign, QW and Lloyds TSB. 


TOC's are not told when to run trains, they are not given their trains, nor are they given tracks and stations, the same goes for ticketing infrastructure. TOC's bid to operate a franchise, part of that franchise does include lease of rolling stock &amp; ticketing infrastructure but they pay for that and also contribute to the cost of new stock even though they won't ultimately own it.  

They pay track access charges for every single train they run, they are never given any track, track and signalling is solely the jurisdiction of Network Rail. 

 There is a lot more competition on the railways now than there ever was and some really significant legal battles by huge corporations to gain the advantage (look at Virgin Trains battle over the west Coast Franchise for instance). There are also brand new private train operators that have nothing at all to do with previous BR operations (Hull Trains who got into massive legal battles with Sea Containers who owned GNER at the time, over track access to the East Coast Main line, which ultimately required the intervention of the Office of the Rail Regulator to sort it. There are also other new companies like Grand Central and Grand Union, neither are anything to do with past BR stuff and both bring real competition to the rail industry (Competition that cannot exist when it is all government run) 

Train operators do get to set ticket prices but annual price rises are usually announced to the media by ATOC (Association of Train Operating Companies) therefore leaving the individual companies out of the spotlight, the rail regulator does play a part in setting parameters but they are wide enough to drive a bus through. Additionally there are tickets for 'Virgin Trains Only' or Hull Trains Only' which are heavily discounted, something that never existed before.


The UK rail network has undergone a massive turnaround since the 90's and still has some way to go, but staff training &amp; qualification, trains, stations, track and signalling has all improved beyond recognition with the investment of Billions of £'s, billions that certainly wouldn't have come along without privatisation. They are significantly more punctual and reliable than ever they were under BR, they pay incredible wages compared to BR (even allowing for inflation) 

The UK rail network is something we should all be rightly proud of, I know bashing the rail industry is easy karma but its just bullshit......I would love to take all you rail bashers back to the BR years and force you to ride the train for a month....you'd soon be clamouring for the public/private rail network we have today.

There's so much to see and do in the UK, it's a massively varied country geographically, socially and culturally (although often not realised by Britons). If you want a day out in a city then look no further than London, you could spend up to about 3 days there if you wanted, there's so much to do, although I imagine you'd get bored after a couple of days. If you want the country side and great scenery then the Yorkshire dales are beautiful, as are the Scottish highlands, and (my personal favourite) Snowdonia national park in north Wales. These places are a little backwater but undeniably beautiful. There's so much history dating back thousands of years all over the British isles. The average Brit probably visits less than a tenth of it in their lifetime. Unless you're doing a lengthy tour, I'd probably get a guide book to the UK and pick your favourites. 

I've never been to Ireland (would love to), but parents went to Dublin the other week and said it is beautiful (as do most who visit) with plenty to do and an interesting history, and the Irish are generally very fun drunks. 

As far as not making mistakes and what not, don't worry. British people love to laugh at everything, so don't take it as offense or anything (unless they're clearly hurling abuse at you). The only time we really get annoyed by tourists (most often American) is when they're being loud and obnoxious. The British quiet and reserve is no myth, especially in certain situations. If you're shouting to family across a museum, we're going to want to punch you. If you're kind, friendly and inquisitive, 9/10 brits will be happy to help, don't worry about acting proper or whatever, you won't see the queen. Oh and by the way, we love the whole royal guard thing and how Americans love that, we get to stand and laugh at tourists act stupid doing it. Also, most brits in places like Buckingham palace are also tourists who have never seen the guards, so if you're doing the same then who cares. 
One of my favorite books on this subject is notes from a small island by Bill Bryson. brilliant book that encompasses the British psyche perfectly (although outdated in places). He tours the UK in that, so I imagine it would be a good general guide geographically, as well as in understanding the British.

I'm from Hertford in Hertfordshire which is just north of London, so I know a fair amount about London if you want to ask. parents are from Manchester too so I know a fair bit about northerners too :) hope I helped, its currently half 2 in the morning here, and I'm writing on my phone. Also, I imagine you'll get better a quality and quantity of replies if you specify a bit more in your questions, they are pretty much the 2 broadest questions you could ask.

There are actually some older lines that could be upgraded for freight use and some other options that are possible that should be looked at - but on the other hand if we don't do things like this because it is too expensive, it will never be done and our infrastructure will crumble over time. Very few countries (even the US to an extent) can afford to outright upgrade infrastructure like this, those times are long gone, you just have to jump in and get it done or fall behind.

I thought that was an awesome episode - I know it's an unpopular opinion, but I thought season 4 was the show's best, and this one looks to be on par to continue the tradition. We have a lot of open ends now - the sweater, some old characters like the GTA guy, Alex's philandering, the probation worker's love for Finn, etc.

Speaking of the probation worker, as much as I loved Sean, I must say this one is one of the best characters the show has ever had. He isn't just used as a joke or a plot point for a few episodes, but is consistently funny and has a lot of story-potential, some of which has been used already quite well. The scene where he was doing karaoke last season was amazing, as was the one this episode where he walked in on Alex and Finn.

Like everyone else, I miss the old characters, but I really feel that this cast is equally captivating and that some of the best episodes are ahead.
I also can't wait to meet Rudy's parents - I've always thought the lack of parental figures was striking (obviously except for Nathan).

As a side note, I wonder if this season they'll use any Arctic Monkey's songs - I've always thought their music, especially the first and to some extent second albums, are pretty much counterparts to this show. They've used the Fratellis and Bloc Party a few times, but I think Arctic Monkeys would fit the mood really well.",0,1383019814,null,0,false,0,cd1wgcq,t3_1p1chu,t1_cd1wgcq,t3_1p1chu,null,1428944670,3,false,misfitstv,t5_2s8pg,3

As it stands today a victim of rape has all the resources society can muster thrown at them to help heal and rebuild their lives, their identity is protected, **all of this is as it should be**. 

The victim of a false accusation on the other hand will have that accusation pop up as the first hits on a Google search for their name *forever*, worse, there will be as many if not more people questioning whether or not it happened (no smoke without fire etc). Sure, this is an extreme case by any measure but an accusation this severe will forever bar you from many professions - not a conviction, just the accusation. 

We have a situation now where there is no effective consequence for making such an accusation, whereas in the past arrests for wasting police time and perjury might have offered some means of redress, they have all but fallen by the wayside. All the while, the moral panic merchants have been pushing for ever greater punishment and even a reduction of the burden of proof in some cases. Hands up who remembers the Pedo Finder General?

I'm not saying that anyone who makes a claim, takes it to court and loses should be locked up as a false accuser.

Then do a few player profiles each week, maybe 1 defender, midfielder, and forward.

By the time you go through the squad, it will be time to update the recent form part of the profile (as the rest should remain constant).
