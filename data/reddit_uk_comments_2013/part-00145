The logic of your double negative grammar make this sentence meaningless and it seems like your playing weasel words to me.  

But I can gather that you have a very narrow view of the industry.  Selling is the tip of the iceberg.   Its years of contracts for servicing, training for operators, getting very cosy with the 'security' services in these places, and these things are very long term.  Would you care to give your reasoning to the East Timorese?  The Karen in Burma?  Nigerians in the Delta?   All recent cases where British weapons were used to suppress and persecute people genocidally.  

Our 'arms industry' is horribly corrupt, and its effects are actually damaging to our economy because this pervasive corruption (Massive overspend by MOD? Oh its only public money).  Not only for bribery, of which there are so many examples, but also stock market effects (Short selling and insider trading are rampant with defence tech companies see UDI, Carlyle Group, Vanguard, Qinetic etc) 'We' are also a massive conduit for the selling of arms by other countries, not just tear gas, so actually your straw man argument that they'll buy from elsewhere really falls down. First they want specific tech, second we sell Russian and Chinese tech as a broker (if the UK wasn't acting as a middle man a lot less introductions to some real nasty Geneva convention shredding shit would never happen)  

You're certainly a useful idiot.  I hope you never find yourself having to deal with the aftermath of a kidnapping of British Engineers targeted specifically because of our laissex-faire approach to developing and selling weapons in order for access to cheap resources.

I have worked places where there were skills gaps. Gaps between what they wanted to pay and what people would work for. Bounties were offered to people who recommended a friend. No-one sold out their friends I'm glad to say. One place had an agency guy in to explain their advert, which was a complete and utter lie from beginning to end.

We're going round in circles here.  Bottom line for me, I think the broad brush picture painted in the press release is correct, whether the actual data meet the actual years stated or not.  Workers' wages have stagnated and prices have ramped since the financial collapse.  Whether or not it's exactly 40 months or the 1870s notwithstanding.  I'm sure a union bod could enter this thread and provide the data you need to make you feel 100% sure of the precise amount of months and the precise date, but it wouldn't change the fact that non silver-collar workers are getting shafted currently and have been for too long.

So from 1 June, he had to examine a team with bloated contracts, deal with players carrying the burden of having a high transfer fee attached to their head, he had to face supporters skeptical of his CV, he had to convince the public that he was the right man for the job.

Then you try and get your coaching staff in place, the scouting team in place, your medical team in place.

Then you have to adjust to the new office, the new secretaries, the staff, the groundskeepers, the tea lady, everyone.

Then you overhaul the playing style, training philosophy, mentality.

Then while all that is happening, you're facing a little hesitation/resistance from the gun-shy FSG who are worried that the same expensive mistakes will be made the new manager.

Then while you're dealing with all that, move your family to Liverpool. Anyone who has moved to a new city will know how stressful that is (no matter how much help you get from the club or not).

Just that if the headline is to believed, it is worse than the 80s, 70s, 60s, 50s, a state of total war, etc.

I don't agree with that at all.  The stagflation we had in the 70s is surely worse?  The numbers from ONS indicate that at a cursory glance.

You have to be careful picking and choosing numbers, if they have used mean wage, then I will be more inclined to believe it, the gap between the upper quartile and lower quartile has closed recently, thus the mean is lower.  For instance whilst inflation has been rather low considering (QE and such) the price of a loaf of bread is incredibly high compared to 10 years ago, whilst the price of a can of coke is about the same.  Now considering we are going to be having an adjustment as the rest of the world gets richer we're definitely going to see our quality of life drop a little bit for certain goods.  I'm not going to try to dispute that.  The Coke / Bread example highlights the issue with a single inflation number.

However I think it's a bit of a bollocks to claim we're worse off now, than we were in the 70s.  The numbers from my interpretation show this, the ONS data set I linked to above should show it simply, I'm genuinely interested by interpretations of these things, so if someone thinks different, please post!

&gt;think the broad brush picture painted in the press release is correct, whether the actual data meet the actual years stated or not

Which is my point, you've got select-o-vision.  There are some interesting experiments around confirmation bias and the like which show people often don't question things they want to hear.

Now I try to always be able to back up anything I assert that is remotely serious.  I also don't get snide with someone who asks me too show the workings.

true,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"&gt;Liverpool have held talks with West Ham United over a possible move for Stewart Downing, as Rodgers continues to remove expensive signings from the club's wage bill. West Ham have followed up their £15m signing of Andy Carroll with an inquiry for his England international colleague, who has entered the final two years of his Anfield contract. That position would impact on Liverpool's negotiating stance and, though no bid has been received for Downing, West Ham would have to pay in excess of £8m to land the 28-year-old winger.

That bit was at the end of [this Guardian article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/jul/08/luis-suarez-liverpool-arsenal).

An official bid wasn't made (according to the Guardian) but there is some interest out there.

I'm just amazed that you want to downplay how bad things are.  Are we super-privileged compared to people in other parts of the world, of course, talk to me about it, I can give you chapter and verse, but that has no relation to the fact that the Western middle and working class is on an inexorable and irreversible decline.

&gt; if they have used mean wage

No one would use the mean wage, it would make no sense to do so, it's statistical nonsense.

&gt;the gap between the upper quartile and lower quartile has closed recently

Irrelevant, we're talking about the gap between the wealthy and the rest.  Look at the top 1% or better yet the top .1% or .01%.

&gt;For instance whilst inflation has been rather low considering (QE and such) the price of a loaf of bread is incredibly high compared to 10 years ago, whilst the price of a can of coke is about the same. Now considering we are going to be having an adjustment as the rest of the world gets richer we're definitely going to see our quality of life drop a little bit for certain goods. I'm not going to try to dispute that. The Coke / Bread example highlights the issue with a single inflation number.

Let's be real about this, the price of processed crappy food and processed crappy plastic goods is coming down as there's an overproduction glut on the market and they're being manufactured in the developing world at ruinous prices for working people there.  Real food and other necessaries of life continue to spiral upwards in price - talk about real food, real accommodation, etc. please, not over-processed corn-based crap and HFCS water which is an early death sentence.

&gt;However I think it's a bit of a bollocks to claim we're worse off now, than we were in the 70s. 

Every worthwhile measure suggests that it isn't. We even had much better growth back then.

&gt; I would suggest that phrases like 'true colours' or 'American interloper' discredit you as a person.

Do they?  Do you deny them then?  Are you American?

true,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"I've been doing my best to try and break down this whole Suarez saga as logically as possible. I wish someone could design a hip flowchart or something but I'll do my best here.

To simplify, it's widely acknowledged that Luis Suarez is a brilliant footballer, incredibly passionate, but he is quite often the center of controversy no matter what club he's at, no matter who the manager is, no matter the vast history of a club.

So... 

* Does Liverpool want to sell Suarez? No, especially when Suarez hasn't formally handed in a transfer request.
* If they do, for how much? Probably 40-50m to a non-Premier League club, probably 50-60m for a Premier League club (or some sort of cash+player deal).
* First off, who can actually *afford* to pay that fee? There aren't very many clubs: Real Madrid? Arsenal? PSG? Monaco (a club that doesn't have Champions League which is a requirement for Suarez)? Chelsea?
* Second, who is willing to pay that fee *and* deal with the Suarez brilliance/headache? Sure, Arsenal is allegedly ready and willing to spend money this window but judging from their recent transfer history (or lack thereof), are they really willing to spend a huge chunk of their transfer budget (whatever that may be, but I have to imagine that 50-60m pounds is a huge chunk of any club's transfer budget in any given window) on a wild card like Suarez?

With all these challenges (and I'm sure I've missed other variables), it makes it very difficult to sell Suarez.

Next week I may feel differently but this week, I think by the time all is said and done, Luis Suarez will remain a Liverpool player by the time the window closes. He will serve his suspension, he will return and play brilliantly. He will likely be the center of another controversy. And if we're not clearly challenging for a top 4 spot by January, we'll see him angling for another transfer once again.",0,1374074633,null,0,false,0,cb4iu2h,t3_1ihafr,t1_cb4iu2h,t3_1ihafr,null,1430435702,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

I didn't like Lukaku at all. Sure, alone his body makes him to a bigger weapon than most other strikers in the league but his first touch was pretty poor. Of course, the 9 defending thais didn't let him a lot of space but I think we'll see the same in the PL against most clubs. Anyway, if he can improve on that he's exactly the striker we need but let's give him time. I think a striker with the technical abilities of a Suarez/Rooney/Lewandowski would could be crucial for us if we want to win the PL this year.

We finished the second half of the season very strong and hopefully we can keep that going.

First you're still trying to reframe.

Second, did you even look at your link?  A wiki of small regional firearms manufacturer's for domestic market does not an arm's industry make.   

Now go and LOOK AT YOUR LINK, LOOK AT EACH COUNTRY, LOOK! THERE IS NOT ONE TEAR GAS COMPANY LISTED.  That's because A) you're looking in the wrong place and B) It is either purchased from a few specialist sources or probably from other state's or institutions stockpiles bc economy of scale means though the recipe is no secret, there is no point in having small domestic runs of a product you can buy cheaply everywhere and that has a use-by-date. [HERE IS THE LIST YOU WANT!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tear_gas_manufacturers) YAy!  Your welcome!   Lo and behold I'm right. But forget the teargas because ITS BESIDE THE POINT.  

Right, so that's you told.  You're now wrong on the terms of your own re-framing and you've broken reddiquette.  Right, I'm gonna go sit in the sunshine and drink something refreshing.  Have a nice afternoon.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt;How do you get that from the title? I mean, there clearly is class war going on, and it isn't the poor who are most aggressive in pursuing it, 

In the 40s, the UK was in what some would call a state of total war.  This means our economy shifts massively to a warfare priority.  My point is that the headline, suggests that no, it is worse than that today.  You've got to go to Victorian times to find it worse.  I don't believe that.  There is a lack of data from them to convince me.

&gt;We're being made to eat an austerity for the sins of the most well-off, none of which has anything to do with the actions of ordinary working people

No we're not.  I'd suggest that the most well off don't care at all.  We're having it because we are spending more than we tax.  The rich often don't care about the spending part, and I would suggest that trying to tax someone at more than 50% is not going to work.  My total tax (including VAT and such) is quite high, I don't mind paying it for the most part, if I didn't like it here, I'd be in HK or whatever.  But take over half.... Yeah, that's not going to do it for me, I'll be gone.  A bunch of people I'd briefly worked with all jumped to Geneva over the 50p rate.

&gt;I'm just amazed that you want to downplay how bad things are. Are we super-privileged compared to people in other parts of the world, of course, talk to me about it, I can give you chapter and verse, but that has no relation to the fact that the Western middle and working class is on an inexorable and irreversible decline.

Because frankly it's not that bad.  For instance if we decided to give every adult £10k, we could do it once, and it would make a massive difference to many peoples lives.  But it isn't sustainable.  Inflation in certain thinks would saw.

I say people are moaning about things in the same way the occupy lot annoyed me.  They set up camp on Old Street, do you know how much that cost me in new tires?  Every day, the bus lane was full of broken glass, so I guess they immediately got off to a bad start with me.  But anyway, I decided to talk to them on multiple occasions, my favourite was when they were turning away all the homeless people apparently they weren't protestors so didn't deserve the organic brown rice they were serving to people.  So they trashed a public space, shunned those in need, but what was it they wanted again?  What did they stand for?  What did they achieve?  Oh nothing.

If someone says well this isn't fair, this isn't right, but doesn't even define what 'this' is, they aren't helping.  If they don't suggest solutions, they aren't helping.

We've been running debt as a nation.  Why?  Who benefited?  We built schools and hospitals at great long term expense to scratch an itch of now.  That isn't sustainable (well schools arguably could be as its investing in future generations).

We've got the ageing population who consume vast resources whilst not generating any themselves, and certainly who didn't save enough for their retirement (personal or state).

However, these things aren't that bad.  We've just got some minor adjustments to make in our lifestyles, for instance the recent rise in inflation is mostly due to fuels.  Well as the rest of the world wants to share in the luxury of burning diesel, we've either got to produce more (hard) or transition to something else (costly).  There isn't solution that brings painless immediate restoration of things we had before.

I started learning Vietnamese mostly because as a dyslexic I'm a masochist.  But either way its really interesting to read the other side of the coin.  A place having massive inflation, where the gap between the rich and the poor is growing at a tremendous rate.  We are going to be bidding against those 92 million people....  This is only going to mean certain things that are common use now, will become more luxury.  Free market theory says somethings will adapt, to a point they have, most new cars get 70+mpg etc.  But the transition is painful.

This is coinciding with the unravelling of certain aspects of our economy.

&gt;No one would use the mean wage, it would make no sense to do so, it's statistical nonsense.
Indeed, but it's better than no workings at all, which is what this piece is.....

&gt;Irrelevant, we're talking about the gap between the wealthy and the rest. Look at the top 1% or better yet the top .1% or .01%.
Are we?  Did you just set the goal posts!  Frankly I don't care too much about what 0.001% of the population are doing, I don't mind that they have better life than I can dream of, so long as my human rights aren't infringed.  Someone like Bill Gates for instance I think has done more for the world than most statesmen.

&gt;talk about real food, real accommodation, etc. please, not over-processed corn-based crap and HFCS water which is an early death sentence.
Erm, I think you miss my point.  A single inflation number isn't always honest.  A 'basket' of goods is tricky.  Tampons are luxury goods but MiniChedders are not (VAT).

&gt;Every worthwhile measure suggests that it isn't. We even had much better growth back then.

Except for the ONS ones I used before.... Keep up.

&gt;Do they? Do you deny them then? Are you American? I've nothing against American people coming here and posting, but, assuming you are from the US, your politics are very different from ours - thank evolution!

Going to disappoint you!  Longest I've ever been in the US was a month studying (I even had a VISA and everything).  It's very interesting that it matters to you.  You discredit someone based on their views not aligning with yours or is it just on ethnic background.

Admittedly, Northern Ireland on an economical level does not provide overly that much, but to forget their past contributions and possible potential is opening up a whole new level of discussion.  Quite frankly, Tom's viewpoint is ignorant.

It comes down to whether we will accept a viewpoint that disregards past and potential future contributions a country offers the UK when a problem arises, or we actually knuckle down, work together, and fix the issues that face our union.

I'd suggest watching You Probably Shouldn't Cook This. It's a semi cooking show she does with her wife (another Internet reviewer)  where they come up with weird recipes and field test them.

2012/2013 12 goals in 27 BPL ggames with 11 assist while playing mostly ACM or second  fiddle.

I dont know where you guys got the stats that Rooney performance have decline in the last couple of years is pretty low blow to discredit him just because you doesn't like him.

&gt;Most importantly we have lukaku, he's proven that even as a 19 year old he's ready to play at a high leve in the premier league.

Lukaku have proven himself with Westbrom not Chelsea, they way in which teams prepare to play Chelsea is different from the way they do WestBrom. I'm not doubting Lukaku ability but we need a World class striker if we want to win the BPl and challenge for every other major titles. 

&gt;Buying rooney and signing him for 5 years would jeapordise romelu's chances.

When have that been a problem for Chelsea, we've never been know to rely on the youth system. Lukaku is only 19 I dont think he's ready to handle the pressure of leading a side like Chelsea or being the focal point of the entire squad.

Basically the family of these companies take on lettings, a little while later claim to be bankrupt and disappear with everyone's deposit. (It happened to us before the safety deposit scheme law was set in).

They get away with it as every time they set up a new company they just change a couple things about the title like what I've displayed above and they change the name of the President of the company to different people in their family so it's damn near impossible to track down or figure out who to take to court. Our landlady ended up having to pay out for all the deposits once they disappeared.

true,traumatology,null,null,"The easiest place to get jobs are fast food places and if you have a local large supermarket that does deliveries, they hire people to start at 5am collecting all the stuff for deliveries. Not surprisingly, those jobs have quite a high turnover. Don't knock fast food work - yes, it's hard, yes the pay sucks, it gets hot and your manager will probably be an asshole - but it gives you a good work ethic, gets you till trained, and future employers will respect it.

I don't think you can sign on if you're a student, and honestly don't bother with their job search facilities. 

I don't know how you're applying for jobs, but looking on company websites, indeed, gumtree, etc, is generally a good shout. If you're handing out CVs, make sure you're well dressed, ask personally for the manager, PUT YOUR CV IN AN ENVELOPE, be memorable! Don't just pop in while you're already in town. And make sure your CV is good. Look for tips online to make it readable and memorable.

Also, ask around. Nepotism is a pretty useful tool in job hunting, unfortunately. If any of your friends have jobs, ask if they can put in a good word for you. Tutors, also. Don't bother asking graduates, they'll be too busy looking for work themselves.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;My point is that the headline, suggests that no, it is worse than that today.

In the sense that the poor now are proportionately poorer than the poor then in relation to their wealthy, then yes, it is, that's exactly what it's saying and it's undoubtedly correct.  We've had a situation worse than the teens/20s jazz-age for a considerable time, so that takes us well beyond the austerity of the 2nd world war years.

&gt; We're having it because we are spending more than we tax.

We can look at waste, but the biggest problem is we've almost entirely ceased trying to tax wealth and instead decided to tax working people.  We no longer tax wealth nor corporations, but instead working incomes and individuals.  Not so long ago, it was considered normal to tax people's and companies' entire wealth, that was considered appropriate and just.  These days, if you threaten to tax a corporation or a wealthy person they suggest they'll take back their ball and stop the capitalist game until they can find a more biased umpire.

&gt;I would suggest that trying to tax someone at more than 50% is not going to work.

Yet, historically it worked very well.  In the New Deal taxes approached 100%, indeed the President wanted a maximum income, and it worked exceptionally well, growth was higher, people were happier and better off...  Will some high profile rich cunts jump ship,of course.  They need to be made to pay a price, but it doesn't need to be messy and violent.  Just ban them and any commercial interest they touch from ever doing business within the country again - but be sure to make their share ownership poison by whichever proxies they seek to use so they can never make a profit from the working people they disparaged again.  Fine, they don't want to be social, society no longer wants them.  Goodbye forever. 

&gt;Because frankly it's not that bad. For instance if we decided to give every adult £10k, we could do it once, and it would make a massive difference to many peoples lives. But it isn't sustainable. Inflation in certain thinks would saw.

Inflation in certain things would soar?  Have you been drinking? :-)  Well, yes, to a degree, you do need to be careful about how money spreads through a community, but handing all the inflationary cash to the banks is just as fucked up and has never been shown to help.  It's pure economic nepotism to just give endless bailout to banks.  Giving cash to the people might be more swiftly inflationary, but at least the inflation would hit all people fairly, unlike quantitative easing when the rich get the extra money first...

&gt;But anyway, I decided to talk to them on multiple occasions, my favourite was when they were turning away all the homeless people apparently they weren't protestors so didn't deserve the organic brown rice they were serving to people. So they trashed a public space, shunned those in need, but what was it they wanted again?

This is mostly bollocks.  It is only even marginally true because of the legal requirements (backed by force) the police and authorities put on the protests.

&gt;We've been running debt as a nation. 

Do you even understand what debt is?  [Read a good book](http://libcom.org/library/debt-first-5000-years-david-graeber) which makes the Austrian and neo-classical economists look like the clueless wankers they are.

&gt;I started learning Vietnamese mostly because as a dyslexic I'm a masochist. But either way its really interesting to read the other side of the coin. A place having massive inflation, where the gap between the rich and the poor is growing at a tremendous rate. We are going to be bidding against those 92 million people.... This is only going to mean certain things that are common use now, will become more luxury. Free market theory says somethings will adapt, to a point they have, most new cars get 70+mpg etc. But the transition is painful.

Arthur Darvill (Rory), [The Night Of The Humans](http://www.amazon.com/Doctor-Who-Night-Humans/dp/B003VXGADE) plus a few others.

I really like the Tennent ones because he narrates in his native Scottish accent, but then fluidly flips to his Doctor accent for the dialog. 

Catherine Tate (Donna), [The Forever Trap](http://www.amazon.com/Doctor-Who-Forever-Exclusive-Adventure/dp/1602838216/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374000206&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=doctor+who+forever+trap). Those are only a few of the great audio adventures. 

My favorite one at the moment is [Prisoner of the Daleks](http://www.amazon.ca/Doctor-Who-Prisoner-Daleks-Unabridged/dp/1602838224/ref=sr_1_59?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373999860&amp;sr=8-59&amp;keywords=doctor+who+audiobook) read by Nicholas Briggs, who does the voices of the Daleks in the new series, and he does a FANTASTIC Tennent impression. 

You can get the audio CD's from places like Amazon/Chapters or they have tons of them on the iTunes store. 

What I enjoy about the audiobooks is the cast members narrating, the small but significant soundtracks, and the emotions you can get through voice but not in print. And hearing **""EXTERMINATE!""** is much more terrifying than reading it. ;)

In Bernard's case specifically, I knew of him but didn't know much about him.  Once his name started appearing related to Liverpool though, I went and had a damn good look at him before deciding how much I like him.

Once a player becomes linked to Liverpool, of course we're all going to have a look at him.  Perhaps we all take a varying degree of depth to our look at these players, but it's pretty obvious being associated with a potential move to the club will instantly generate interest from us.  I personally go and download full matches, usually at least 5, for the players that seem interesting or impressive at first and try to take an in depth look at them.  I love learning about the players and the game in general and this tends to be a pretty great exercise into doing both of those things.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with getting excited about the potential signings of our club.  There's also nothing wrong with having a look at them and picking favorites out of those potential signings.

I know I made a lot of noise about Micky and recently have been excited for Bernard, so let me clear this up on the spot: Mikhitaryan is still the one I wanted most.  We missed out on him and I don't particularly have a new favorite at this point (Shaqiri would be if we had a chance in hell at getting him and I would have always wanted him more than Micky... but it'll never happen).  From the reasearch I've done on Bernard (6 Minerio matches, Confed Cup, and the normal youtube stuff) I like him a lot and I think he'd be a really good player for us.

Just because you are comfortable with something that's hot or intense, doesn't mean that you don't *feel* the heat or intensity.

Two different things.

So if my wanker friend ate a very spicy dish and, because he's so fucking tough, he says that it's not ""hot"", would he then offer that food to a small child? I don't think so.

It's hot.

An odd way to look at continuity, but it is one of the longest-running dramas on television, so they must be doing something right. 

Then Moffat just bald-facedly states that he basically doesn't give a damn about what's been established, because they'll just ""make something up"" if it becomes an issue. He was so good as a writer, and he's a careless, lazy dramatically-cheating, melodrama-over-drama hack as a showrunner. Makes me miss Davies, which I never thought I would say. I have loved just about everything else he's done (*Second Coming* is one of the best things ever done for television by anyone), but his Who tenure started off brilliant and went downhill after the first season.

City/Chelsea/United are very wealthy teams (truth be told so are Arsenal and Liverpool they are just run in a manner closer to Spurs) that have owners/ownership groups that can and will back the team with money that isn't generated from the club.

B. Nasri should not be played in a wider position, Mancini did it for two straight years and he was no where near the player he was at Arsenal before he made the switch.  Nasri is best in a central role.  Silva can play out wide but he is best when he is able to float around the top and create from a multitude of positions. You are right about Navas and Jovetic can play from a wide position when needed.  He did so at Fiorentina as well as playing a CF role behind a main striker.  

C. Aguero is the best striker we have, period.  He should get first right to the striker spot everytime, we shouldn't move him so that we can play one of the other strikers in front of him.

It would be an ad hominem if I had merely made a personal attack.  I hadn't.  What you wrote made no sense at all.  It was gibberish.  It is as if you simply streamed some random words onto the screen and hoped for the best.

&gt;Again, I didn't make a formal logical statement. 

Again, an illogical statement is an illogical statement.  You can't just say it wasn't meant to be criticised or logical.  That is a pathetic cop-out.  

**If you say something illogical, it doesn't matter whether it's said formally or informally, it is still illogical.**  

Something stupid doesn't stop being stupid, just because it was said ""informally"".

&gt;My argument wasn't based on it, it was just a comment.

This is one of the most pathetic attempts at playing semantics that I have ever seen on the internet.  You were arguing with someone and it was an illogical argument.  Saying it's just a ""comment"" doesn't somehow magically stop it from being illogical.  Most of reddit is made up of comments.

Kelly---Skrtel---agger--jose

-------lucas--gerrard-----

Aspas/Downing---coutihno---sterling/ibe

----------Suarez----------




GK -Even with Mignolet being younger I would still go with Reina, despite his sometime inconsistencies I think he is a top flight keeper and there's a reason he's been constantly rumoured with barca the past few years.

RB -for me, Kelly all day over Johnson. I think Johnson is good going forward but still not solid going back as where I think Kelly is a beast defensively in almost every way and has the physical talents and crossing ability to maraud forward. 

RCB - Unless we sign Papadopalous (love that guy but looking increasingly unlikely) I still think that Skrtel is our 2nd best no matter who we sign, he had a rough year learning the system and then niggling injuries for the rest of the campaign. top physical presence, aggressive and a lot better positional play than I think people realize. 

LCB - Agger all day. top ball playing defender, such a consistent ball winner and perfect for our style of play.

LB - I like enrique, he's a hard worker and usually makes up for any mistakes with pure effort. similar to me with johnson except a grade up defensively and knows when to pass the ball instead of lose it on a dribble and get caught way up field. (generally)

 RCM - Lucas is one of the worlds best imo. in time i think he will be seen as one of the great midfield maestros we've seen. it amazes me how much he actually does for the team. wins so many balls back with little positional interceptions and incredibly well timed tackles. he makes up for a large lack of speed with speed of thought, i feel as though he is what joe allen aspires to be some day. 

LCM - still the best CM in england, played so well in the second half of last season and even though he's coming off injury he actually got to rest and not put on the england jersey at all this summer which could actually help him a lot.

RW - depending on the day really. if BR wants to have his wingers pinching in as more inside forward types cutting in to their strong foot and looking to combine with our forward and score then aspas. if he wants a really hardworking fairly good technician then downing. I am a lot higher on downing than most people admittedly. I just love his character in addition to his skill. i'm sure someone could show me a highlight tape of this but i rarely see him making a terrible pass or losing the ball or not tracking back on defense. one complaint about him is his lack of top end pace and ability to really beat a man and get the shot off, he flashes those abilities but not on the regular as with players in the robben type mold.

CAM - game after game Coutinho seems to impress for us every time he puts on the shirt. is still a very young player yet he has the mental maturity of a mid in his prime. So excited to see him get even better. (scary thought for other teams)

LW - I love love love both Ibe and Sterling and while Ibe did score that goal against preston I don't think it would have gone in against most prem sides. That said however while they are definitely different players they occupy the same potential position and the competition between them would be great to see with such high value youths trying to one up the other and vie for that starting spot.

ST - if he is here no question in my mind, one of the worlds best and seems to thrive under BR and his system. If he's not, Sturridge also shows a lot of ability and more potential yet to grow. 

Bench - our bench this year seems the deepest its been in a while for me at every single position except lb and a bit thin before we buy anyone at cb, although johnson can cover and hopefully hes on the bench a bit ; ) . GK Mignolet should bring great competition and hopefully a future stud (he's already a prem level goalie at 24). rb we have a ton of players who i would feel comfortable with, kelly johnson wisdom flanagan toure can all play there and have in their careers. cb we have toure and coates (who i would be very happy seeing loaned out) and wisdom, maybe kelly. CM we have henderson who finished really strongly last year and Allen who is still young enough to bounce back from a subpar season. Attackers we have almost en-masse. aspas, downing, alberto, borini, sturridge, ibe, sterling, maybe yesil, and hopefully suarez.

Think of it this way—you're a world-class striker playing at a rich club, but time and time again the hierarchy won't shell out the cash for world-class teammates. You get pissed off, give them an ultimatum: either they give you a better supporting cast, or you're gone. They reneg, pay you handsomely to stay, and then a few years later (after losing the title to their closest rival by goal-difference due to lack of quality players and backups at certain positions) they go ahead and buy two world-class players—but *both* at **your position**! You're annoyed but you grin and bear it, and you go on to win the league, in large part due to the bungling of last season's champs and the management crisis at a club that is far more awesome than yours.

Even leaving out the possibility that Fergie threw Rooney under the bus to spite him when he told the press that he'd handed in a transfer request, wouldn't the above situation rub you the wrong way?

30c in the grand scheme of things is hot, but nothing unusually hot and in certain areas totally normal.

Like today where I am its about 30c out and nobody has mentioned a single thing about it being hot or bad out.  Its just ""normal"".  

By comparison most of us would be flipping out saying our balls were freezing together at around 18c and we'd be layered for it too.

AC's nice, as are designs for specific temperature ranges, but more than anything is about acclimation and being used to a certain climate range.

British people as a whole just love to complain, you never hear people here complain that its too hot, its a great excuse to sit outside having a BBQ after work with a few beers, not a reason to get all annoyed, angry and upset which is how the UK seems to always react.

Also, most offices here will allow people to wear whatever they want when it gets this hot. I think that makes the biggest difference of all.

&gt; 'Born in Lambeth, the son of a road-mender, John Day was sent out to work when scarcely more than ten years old. His father was decidedly addicted to drink, and was in the habit of taking his son on Sunday to public-houses, where drink was sold in defiance of the Licensing Act. So long as the child had a few halfpence for beer, he was in the parental eyes a good boy; but when his meagre earnings had been thus uselessly spent, his father came to the conclusion that he could not afford to keep him, and that it was high time the boy should fight his own way in the world. He was therefore turned out of his home, and had to resort to the friendly, if cheerless shelter of railway arches; or at times he would sleep on a barge, and profited by the opportunity to wash his solitary shirt in the canal, and hang it up on the rigging of his temporary home, while he disported himself amidst the tarpaulin till it dried. At time when there was nothing to be done at the flour-mill, he obtained a little work as assistant to a neighbouring chimney-sweep; but in either employ he rarely made more than 3s.per week.'

&gt; And ends:

&gt; 'He is now the happy father of a large family, he lives in a house near Lambeth Walk, where he once humbly worked in the capacity of a mere assistant. As a master sweep he has an extensive connexion. The money he earns enables him to subscribe to several benefit societies, and he is entitled to receive from them 10s. a week in sickness, while his wife will have £46 given her at his death, or he will receive £18 should she die first. Altogether he is both prosperous and respected throughout the neighbourhood, where he ardently advocates the cause of total abstinence, and is well known as the temperance sweep.'

It definitely is, to a large degree, what you're used to. When I have to be outside in this heat, I get worn down and exhausted far faster than people who grew up with this climate. I also feel the cold a LOT more in the winter, because this area has much more variation in both directions. I don't think I'd last five minutes somewhere like Arizona.

It's fine as long as I can stay in my air conditioned comfort zone. The other day I went out to mow the lawn as soon as I considered it a socially acceptable time to do so so that I could take advantage of the relatively cool 28 degree temperature in the morning. Pushing the mower around one of those big American yards in the blazing heat... It did NOT feel good. But oh man the AC felt BEYOND wonderful afterwards.

It does make me wonder if the UK will be forced to make changes in order to deal with an altered climate. There's been increasing amounts of snow in the winter regularly for the last few years, and if that turns out to be more than just a temporary fluke then the country may have to invest in things like snowplows that make huge snowstorms no more than a brief inconvenience here.

1. There's no real economy. It used to be a major centre for pottery (John wedgewood etc) but like the rest of the manufacturing industry in the UK, it's gone and there's nothing there to replace it. This is the key problem.

2.  Big lack of investment. It's slap bang in the middle of Manchester and Birmingham, all the money goes to these big cities and there's nothing left for stoke, which suffers from poor infrastructure and lots of empty offices.

3. There's no real sense of ambition. The schools are poor and that combined with the first two points means that all those who are capable leave, getting better jobs in Manchester or Birmingham. The people left (to my outsider's perspective) just don't seem like they have any plans for their life. It's also full of chavs and is a stronghold for EDL/BNP types.

true,robdabank,JE,jersey,"I think everyone appreciates skepticism about the possibility of purchasing Rooney from United. He [Rooney] would be another big money signing that for many echoes of the Torres signing which led to 3 seasons with Chelsea in which he scored less than 10 league goals. ROI aside, there might be people [I won't speak for anyone here, I'm just guessing] who don't think Rooney would be good to have at the Bridge for the reason that he's a Manchester United player. Regardless, I think debate and discussion about the possibility is healthy and natural.

With regards to your table, I think it ignores a few dimensions of Rooney as a person and player that make him worth more holistically speaking.

In terms of wages I would argue that at Manchester United, Rooney is paid accordingly. Only because for the past eight seasons or so Rooney has evolved into the franchise player of Manchester United. Feel free to disagree, and United fans might feel differently as well - but until Van Persie's season this past year Rooney has been the face of United. While I don't think it's likely, I think Rooney's wages could be up for debate if he arrived at the bargaining table with Chelsea. He wouldn't be the face of the club like he would have been at United, and he'd be arriving older than when he arrived at Old Trafford nine years ago. There's always a chance his wages could come down if he moved to Chelsea.

Speaking on appearances and goals, you note that Mata played in more competitions all season. Rooney rode the pine a lot last season because of the arrival of Robin Van Persie, perhaps unfairly. It's worth looking at two seasons ago when Manchester City won the league. They only won on goal difference, Rooney scored 27 goals in 34 league appearances, and was the second highest scorer in the league. Even if you go back to the season Chelsea last won the league, Rooney still scored 26 goals. I can only speculate but I think Ferguson chose Van Persie to lead striking this season because of his 30 goals the year prior, if he [RVP} ended up being a flop I wouldn't have bet against Rooney to score 20+ goals in the league provided he wasn't being used as the option striker rather than the main.

Under current value to the club you value Rooney as the 'second fiddle striker'. Perhaps, but in recent days we've seen headlines from papers like The Guardian that suggest Moyes still values him. Whether it's as an option striker or as a potential first string player I won't say, but in either case the club still values him a great deal. Considering there was such vehement offense to a bid [that ended up not being true] for £10M + Chelsea's star midfielder from the club, I don't buy the idea that they don't value Rooney at the club.

I don't think it's fair to compare the attitudes of Juan Mata and Wayne Rooney either. Mata has been given start after start, the club needed him to start last season, and he's emerged as a leader and unifying figure among fans and players. Of course he's going to have a good disposition towards things because he's being given what he wants, appearances. Rooney on the other hand was given the bench to a freshman striker at the club last year after seasons of service under Ferguson. Not everyone can be Paulo Ferreria and be a saint when your appearances are reduced, some players get upset. Rooney obviously did, but if I recall correctly Lukaku was upset a few seasons ago when he saw himself not on loan and spending more time on the bench than on the field. To go from a franchise player under one manager to a fringe player under another in one season, I don't exactly blame Rooney for being upset. He wants to play, it's what he's shown that he is incredibly capable of doing since 2004.

With regards to win percentage without Rooney. I don't know how long the time period is you've been calculating this. If it's with England, Opta says that their W% is 69% without Rooney. If it's the club this past season, it's worth noting that Rooney played 68% of the games that Robin Van Persie did, and started less often. If it's the MUFC's W/L% since Rooney signed, that's a whole other story.

As for age, United signed a 29 year old Robin Van Persie last season and he scored 26 league goals. 

I guess the point I'm trying to make is that I don't think you're evaluating Rooney fairly. 

I don't think he was given a fair shot at United last season, and has since had the rug pulled out from him by Moyes. A move to a club that is in need of a world class striker for the upcoming season (this was said on Chelsea TV in the post-match today) might give him the fuel he needs to perform. At the same time there's the risk that he might be a total flop and only score 3 goals in his first season if he did move here - risk needs to be calculated but his previous record shouldn't be ignored because of one season where he played significantly less games than the one prior.

Let me be clear, **this is not me trying to say sign him up**, but in reading threads on this sub I think the cases for purchasing Rooney and against purchasing him have been flimsy.

What? Firstly every manager has made shitty transfers, every single one. The longer you're in the game the more shitty transfers you make, it's probability. Secondly how about backing that statement up with some examples? Thirdly it's ""your"" not ""you're"" in this sentence.

&gt; And considering how much rooney makes and his performances the last couple years it's fair to call him overpaid, he's on 200k a week iirc.

Ok Rooney was on fire the season before last, on fucking fire 44 appearances and 34 goals in all comps, then Man Utd bought RVP and he lost his head a bit, got injured and sulked, not the worst but also kind of understandable. As for his wages how much Revenue does having England's best player on your books bring in to your club?

&gt; Most importantly we have lukaku, he's proven that even as a 19 year old he's ready to play at a high leve in the premier league.

FFS He's not ready to lead the line in a team chasing across 4 fronts next season, nowhere near, people on here need to understand he is not the new saviour of Chelsea, he's very good but needs more experience and learning before he will be world class. unlike Rooney who is World class.

First off 5 years? where did you pull that from? fucking magical made up land in your head, right?

true,jcmosch,logo,,"/u/thepowerofscott is absolutely correct. 

1) Zaba is first choise. 
2) Micah is an important squad player (two deep at every position is obvious), but is also EXTREMELY integral off-the-field and for camaraderie. 

Other points for me:

-Micah is English and homegrown. With FA requirements, he is very useful to have, especially when he is clearly talented enough to play at the highest level. 

-Versatility. If Kolarov leaves, Zab is 2nd choice LB, and Micah would be RB.  Also Micah is somewhat proficient at CB, and could be useful in a 3-5-2 with his offensive capability. MP likes versatility (targeting Jovetic as such, using Garcia at CB in first friendly), and I would expect him to toy with certain positioning to keep somebody as talented as Micah in the squad. 

-Finally, commitment. I fully believe Micah doesn't want to leave City. He knows he will get time, and I think that's good enough for him. The only way I could see a change is if he feels he is being pushed out of any chance at an England squad and needs week-in week-out playing time, but if MCFC are deep in UCL, Cups, and the EPL, we'll undoubtedly see squad rotation.

&gt;Hugo Lloris is pleased with Tottenham’s capture of Paulinho but is unsure whether the Brazilian will get too much time to play alongside Gareth Bale.

&gt;The Welshman scored on his 23rd birthday as Spurs kicked off their pre-season campaign with a 1-1 draw with Swindon Town yesterday.
&gt;
&gt;While the winger has participated in the club’s official kit launch, suggesting he will stay at White Hart Lane for another season, goalkeeper Lloris knows anything can happen when a players is linked with a move to Real Madrid.
&gt;
&gt;“It’s nice to see him in good form,” Lloris said.
&gt;
&gt;“But pre-season is long so we need to concentrate on our work. It’s good to see him but it’s just the beginning.”
&gt;
&gt;On the arrival of Paulinho, the Frenchman told Sky Sports: “It’s a good thing for us to have a Brazil international in our team.

true,ibpants,1972crest,,"For what it's worth, here are my thoughts.

Micah can be a bit suspect defensively. Pairing him up with Milner further up the right often means that there isn't much of a problem, but all my research on Pellegrini tells me that he was the attack to be all about attack and the defense needs to take care it's own problems.  For that reason I don't expect to see much of Milner or Barry, both players that can mop up after fullbacks, so I think Zaba will be first choice because he can power forward (not as intimidatingly as Micah) but he's maybe a touch more adept at cleaning his own messes.

That said, I do think there will be rotation and that Micah will prove to be an important player against more stubborn defences.

As for youngsters, Wabara had a very good loan spell with Oldham (particularly in the FA Cup) and will hope for another with Blackpool this coming season.  At 21 he is playing at a respectable level but will need to grow over the coming 2 or 3 years to make the first team.  Behind him is 18 year-old Shay Facey who gave a reasonable account of himself in the recent friendly, but has a lot of hard work ahead of him to reach Premier League football.

Micah will score an overhead kick (most likely in his testimonial match).

Historically look at Tony Book.  He was City's right back and captain during our most successful years (you'll still see him at the Etihad watching along with Mike Summerbee).

true,[deleted],null,null,"The law is (or was) simultaneously sexist against men and women.

I can't marry my boyfriend (David), but a woman could marry David. That's a sexist restriction on who can marry a man.

At the same time, I could marry a woman (Elizabeth), but another woman couldn't marry Elizabeth. That's a sexist restriction on who can marry a woman. Therefore, the law contained two separate forms of sexism.

The legal right to get married doesn't have anything to do with whether you're gay or not. The law can't police that. The problem with the law is that it is (was) sexist, and there's a consensus in our society is that we should not give men and women different rights - such as the right to marry a man. 

On incest, I can't think of anyone I've ever heard of who wants to marry a close relative, and we have laws against incest for some pretty good reasons, namely child abuse. Now, I'm well aware this is a straw man issue you're bringing up because you don't like gay people and don't want us to have equal rights.

true,Omblae,UnionFlag,Surreh - Honda Hornet CB600F,"Hello mate, I recently passed my test am roughly the same age as you and have a good breakdown of all the costs incurred for my bike and the gear, plus a bit of advice to boot. Warning: counter-essay ahead!

Basically, my rider training cost me 600 quid plus a 50 quid theory - this included all the tests + CBT. I then picked up a Honda Hornet for 1000, got it insured for 480 a year (about a little over 40 quid a month) TPFT, picked up full leathers and boots off Ebay for 100 quid (brandnamed stuff too! Had the helmet already from my previous bike though) and stuck a restrictor on myself for £50 off Ebay again. Total cost = around £2200 over a couple of months (if you include paying for insurance in one block, if not it's significantly cheaper if you have income per month to cover it). Basically bang on what your budget is! 

If you're not having to pay for a bike then you'll save a bit on that but be warned, I've not seen a restrictor for an A2 licence for the raptor although it uses the SV engine so you may be able to use those instead. I hear those 650 raptors are known for little gremlins though - so might be better off buying yourself something else which hasn't sat around unused for ages - like I say you can pick up loads of bikes for a grand that are well and truly brilliant little runners.

I live in Leeds just down the road from Sheff and I'll tell you you most likely don't want to be relying on the bike during the worst of winter - the roads in Yorkshire get bitterly cold/wet/icy and I've been advised to stay well clear of them on the bike from a couple of mates who've had their 125s up there. I had my car up there over the last couple of winters and it was a complete ballache sometimes - a bike would only be more hassle. Generally if you're sticking to main roads you're okay but it's more a case of worrying about those little B-roads as they can often be less upkept. 

What i'd say though is get your licence ASAP - that way they can't change the laws before you are of age as they have a dirty habit of doing! If you get your A2 at 19, you can go for your full licence aged 21 - rather than waiting for DAS at 24 which IMO is an absolutely atrociously high age to have to be for a full licence. Yes you have to test again, but at least you can be on your way to riding whatever you like by a more reasonable age and get all the fun of a lower powered starter bike. 

In terms of whether you should do it - I was in the same boat as you, although I'd had the joy of a 125 previously to tempt me further. Basically, if you don't do it now you will most likely get yourself into a tizzie about it - I know I did. It's best to just get the test done and get a bike to keep yourself happy (you will be VERY happy all the time), but perhaps look for something that isn't as powerful as that Raptor if you've never had one before. Granted you'll need a restrictor, 47HP is still more than enough to get you into serious trouble if you're inexperienced enough. 

As for your mum mine was keen on me getting a bike but my dad wasn't at all - I sat down and had a chat with him about it and basically used my 3+ years experience on the road with no accidents to sway him. Then I showed him the gear I'd bought and showed him what I'd learnt at the testing facility to keep myself alive and well. I showed him the Mod1 and Mod2 test sheets and how I incurred no minors on either test, proving that I was serious about learning how to safely handle a bike. In the end, he wasn't thrilled but he understood and accepted my choice as an adult - I imagine your mum could do so too but she may very well be different. Economy is a big factor compared to a car - I get 50+ mpg out of my hornet and my insurance is well under a third of what it was on my old beat up Golf with my tax costing only 60 odd quid a year. 

Riding has been a true life-saver in many ways for me - I've found myself  not wanting to get off the bike at all and have loved every minute. Getting smoother and sharper and learning all about riding defensively and safely whilst still being able to lean nicely into corners and gas it out is just great fun no matter what you're riding. In my opinion, if you truly love motorbikes then no amount of words either way will sway you - you will take your tests, you will get a bike and you will love it and want to be with it at all times. Having a bike is much like a girlfriend, except requires less maintenance and involves bigger thrills.

We would have a bit of a small front three but there is enough heart in all three of them that it wouldnt matter AS much. Toure would be a great, hulking, experienced #8, while coutinho would be perfect for scrummy.

Bingo! same here.

My kids eat the same stuff we do. 

Just last weekend I was at a friend's place for lunch. We put together a table full of different foods. It was nothing special or crazy, just coleslaw, roast chicken pieces, bread, olives, cherry tomatoes, etc. Really good food. 

My daughters were eating a bit of everything. My friend's daughter walked up to the table and said, ""Mummy, there's nothing here that I like."". I was gobsmacked ...

Then the conversation turned to fussy eaters and my friend said that she was a fussy eater as a child and she had to endure being made to eat her meals, so she wanted to protect her daughter from the same thing. 

From what I've seen, fussy parents create fussy children. I know a bunch of adults who are fussy eaters, and I've seen the way they treat their children.  They basically give in at the slightest hint of resistance and give the child whatever they want. Eventually the child becomes a nightmare to feed ...

I have these table rules:

(1) You try a bit of everything. No picking and choosing.

(2) You don't say ""yuck"". Taste is a personal thing. Don't trash a particular food because the person who likes that food doesn't want to hear someone telling them how awful it is.

.14. Sturridge - Pace and lethal finishing.

.13. Henderson. Good support player. Decent runner and passer.

.12. Suarez. Playmaker. Will attract the defence and leave space for others. Can break on his own or use his passing and skills to make space for others.

.11. Sterling. Lightning quick with all the skills needed to beat a man. 

.10. Gerrard.  Great raking boot and excellent decision maker.

.9. Coutinio. Great passer and can snipe from the base.

.8. Toure. Great all rounder. Can pass, run, tackle and good support player. 

.7. Reina. Excellent at scavenging for the ball on the floor. Lineout option too.

.6. Lucas. Best tackler in the team.

.5. Skirtel. Made of rock and tall enough to take lineout ball.

.4. Kelly. Same as Skirtel

.3. Enrique. Energy to get around and solid defensively.

**Whats that?! Why Cardiff?!**

^Because ^it's ^ace ^obviously, ^numpty.

1. Nightlife is immense (probably priority #1 for most here)
2. It's like a mini holiday for people who have never been to Wales. You can soak up a lot of culture and get a feel for the country in a very short span.
3. Cardiff Bay. I estimate most here are lower 20s to mid 30s (at least the majority) and Cardiff bay has been built up aiming directly at that age range. Museums (Dr Who musuem for the fans), bars, quality restaurants, plenty of places to walk or chill in the sun, right beside the sea (Cardiff Bay is technically a barrage so the water is pretty damn calm). We even have an artificial beach getting built in the middle of the restaurants and bay front, London style. Tons of events going on during the summer. 
4. City centre - Fantastic shopping scene, again events going on either sports related or generally Welshy stuff on Queens Street, great restaurants again, more pubs/clubs, Cardiff Castle!, Cardiff Museum (which is fantastic), loads of parks and lakes within walking distance. You can walk to the bay or get the train which is regular till late (every 10mins I've been told).
5. Fairly reasonably priced for being south of the British Isles. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of places to go if you're feeling flush but there are definitely budget options too. We have a huge huge student population so there is a lot aimed towards that financial bracket for needs and entertainment. 
6. If some people bring cars, feeling generous or take the bus/train, Swansea is close by for another taste of nightlife with some epic beaches again. BBQ?!
7. Sure is a beautiful place, boss. 
8. Brecon
9. If people change their mind about meeting internet strangers after arriving there is plenty to do alone to pass them time and make it worthwhile. It's a city you can happily get lost in alone and still get something from it. It's also quite small in respect to other cities so you can experience all of it in a short time. 
10. I'm here. SO basically that should be worth at least 9 of the 10 points. 
Real 10. Although Mr Fidelcabro had a bad time previously on the rail (realistically who's had a good time on a train?) and it takes 3 hrs 15mins from Manc to get here (near enough same time driving, least it did on my route), I did a quick price check and you can get away with fares of £15 - £36 in the beginning of August late week/end of week. That's one way. I've stayed in guest houses here for £30 a night with parking/breakfast and The big sleep hotel which is super budget but I think I was paying £18 a night. 

Anyways as usual I've wrote too much but I'm originally from England so you can at least get an idea of how much I like the place. Even if we don't go I do recommend it for another time!

Like miscegenation and gay marriage? There was always a point when it transitions from an aberration to the norm, anything can become the norm.

The scottish government carried out a consultation and most people do not support  gay marriage.

Why would you need ot legislate brother and sister not to have kids? Do we regulate the disabled from having kids when we know with 100% certainty their kids will be disabled? The rate of birth defects is not that much higher in brother/sister. Certainly not as high as high as those with hereditary diseases,

true,Omblae,UnionFlag,Surreh - Honda Hornet CB600F,"0 on the bike - I've got 2 years NCB on my car but they didn't ask me about it at all when I put it to the insurer so obviously car NCB makes no difference. Most quotes I was getting were around 1000 - but a couple of insurers provided much lower quotes if the value of the bike was lower and it was garaged. I also cut my usage down to around 6000 miles a year and had my excess up to about 450 - check comparethemarket as they were giving me the best prices. 

In my opinion steer away from a 125 if you're going for the full licence - it'll only disappoint you. Something like a 500 makes more sense - you can get loads of them in under 47HP in stock trim which saves you having to put a restrictor in and they're a barrel of laughs to boot. A Hornet only comes in 600cc, 919 or a rare 250 import from Japan - there isn't a 500 hornet. The 250's are a pain in the arse to insure and under the A2 licence you can't ride a 919 as it produces too much power. 

Check the SV 650 out too - it's a decent starter bike and handles restriction really bloody well plus it gets great MPG.

Basically I was thinking that this Angel wanted the Doctor to hurt.  It wanted revenge.  The Angels were reproducing this episode and Winter Quey was their ""nest"".  The Angel in chains was the ""mother"" and the ""Father"" was that angel in the hotel that seemed smarter than the rest.  The ""dumb"" angels that rushed the heroes were juveniles/teenagers not yet taught by experience the importance of covering their eyes.

The Angel that got Rory is was the ""Father"" who survived the paradox.  He saw all his children wiped out by it.  His mate, likely starved from being chained so long, probably also died.  It wanted revenge.  Angels must have some sort of temporal sense considering how they knew to go after the Tardis in ""Blink"" and the energy source the crack could be in ""Time of the Angels"".  Looking at the Doctor and River Song would be anomalies.  Even Rory and Amy to a degree.  Angels aren't dumb beasts and this is an adult, he likely guessed time travelers and could see the scarring around the time period.

So it got revenge the best way it could.  Waiting.  Expecting their return eventually.  Then getting the one responsible for killing his family.  His mate throwing herself as a meal was a bonus.  ""Father"" would spare the two that seemed to be time travelers to lament how they can't save the murderer this time.

EIM32140 - Travel expenses: travel for necessary attendance: more than one permanent workplace at the same time

Section 339(2) ITEPA 2003

Someone who has two or more employments, or is in an employment that requires regular attendance at more than one workplace, may have more than one permanent workplace at the same time. 

Each case must be decided on its own facts and most employees will only have one permanent workplace at any one time. Factors that point to a workplace being a second permanent workplace include:

* the employee regularly performs a significant part of his or her duties there

* people would expect to be able to contact the employee at the second workplace

* the employee has an office, or desk, and support services at the second workplace that he or she regularly uses.

No single factor is decisive in establishing whether a second workplace is a permanent workplace. It depends on the employee's work pattern. But if, for example, an employee regularly spends 40% of his or her time at a second workplace, it is unlikely, given the frequency of the visits, that each visit would be to perform a task of limited duration or for some other temporary purpose. In this example the presumption would be that the second workplace is a permanent workplace.",0,1374105003,null,0,1374105308,0,cb4v0f5,t3_1ih84t,t1_cb4v0f5,t1_cb4m1yq,null,1430429820,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,ChocoMcShreddy,cnty-wales,Wales,"You should watch PMQ's. Most people from abroad find it quite amusing that the goings on of the House of Commons are a bit like a bunch of schoolboys shouting at each other and that is largely what it is.

As has been said, committee goings on often deal with the actual runnings of government and these are a lot more formal and proper. But the House of Commons has always had this platform of members being able to throw sarcastic insults at each other. It runs in stark contrast to the House of Lords which is far more formal and less like schoolboy banter.

However the members elected to the commons are (in a rather broad and loose sense) ordinary folk elected to represent their constituencies whereas Lords are appointed by a higher authority, thus lending the difference in characteristics of the two houses to be self-explanatory.

That doesn't mean that the goings on of the government are largely disrespectful in that manner, whilst MPs may not have to like each other, they still have to refer to each other as ""The Right Honourable Gentleman"" or ""My Right Honourable Friend"" and such. It's very archaic speech but that's what you get when dealing with a very old political institution.

I would prefer it as it is now, rather loose-lipped in the lower house, which is something of a contrast to other countries where representatives are either violently at each other's throats all the time or under too many rules of politeness to be able to openly criticise each other. It's something rather unique to the UK and Commonwealth politics.

I've tried to get my daughter to eat some of the things I don't, so she likes rice fortunately and has eaten a bit of yoghurt (doesn't seem to like it much though).

Another thing I do is give her those packets of pureed fruit and vegetables, particularly the ones with vegetables in (eg apple/spinach/parnsip, or pear/pea/broccoli) as a snack.  I figure it's kind of like a smoothie, keeps the nutrients going in, and keeps her familiar with the taste of vegetables.  They're just easier to have on hand than chopped vegetables, and slip down much more easily. Then if she is having a fussy or low appetite day - it's amazing how little toddlers eat sometimes - at least she's had some nutrition inside her.

I've also found that she's 100x more likely to want food in my bowl than in hers, even if it's the same.  So sometimes I just share a plate/bowl with her.

true,himit,null,null,"Here's some advice from a UK expat to Australia, where we had to survive 43C with only a ceiling fan.


Get a standalone fan and point it at your face.

If you can't afford one...

Open up your windows.

Stick a bottle of water in the freezer.  When it's frozen, wrap it in a teatowel and lug it about with you.  It's an instant ice-pack and the teatowel stops it from melting too quickly, giving you icy-cold refreshment throughout the day (you can obviously freeze squash and stuff too).

Move your computers/heat producing equipment to somewhere a bit more open, if you can (move it away from the wall and face the fan towards an open area to disperse the heat)

Walk more slowly.

Chill out!  It's hot, but it's not humid.  And soon enough you'll be complaining that it's freezing and raining and there's no sun, so find a way to enjoy it.  Once you start thinking 'it's too hot' you've set yourself off on a cycle of being too hot and you'll be miserable.  Enjoy the tropical weather without the tropical bugs for the week or so while you can.

Stick to the shade where you can.  I know this seems like anti-Englishness (since everyone lounges in the sun) but there's a reason most Aussies are less tanned.  We get out of the sun when we can because it's much, much cooler in the shade.

Go for loose clothing rather than less clothing.  A super-loose cotton long-sleeve will keep you cooler than a tight tank-top.

When you're really just far too hot, ice the back of your neck and the top of your head.  Those are the bits that cool you down the fastest.  If you haven't got ice, water on a paper towel works just as well.

If you're one of the unlucky sods who's taps are running hot, fill up a few bottles in the fridge - two for drinking (replenish as they run down to keep a constant supply) and one or two for incidentals (like pouring cool water on your head).

Flip flops and a breathable, light-coloured hat are your friends.  ",0,1374106871,null,0,false,0,cb4vnt4,t3_1ihsv6,t1_cb4vnt4,t3_1ihsv6,null,1430429514,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

Why shouldn't they?

You've talked about ""sexism"" in your comments here about marriage equality, but it seems to me like gay people are too hung up on the fact that you're born that way or ""it's not a choice"". 

IDGAF what way you're born, or what you choose - IMO LGBT equality has progressed in recent decades because society initially recognised that *it's nobody else's business what you get up to in the privacy of your own bedroom* (as long as it involves only consenting adults, obviously). This has recently broadened to an understanding that *it's nobody else's business who you love and wish to share your life with.*

It's just as bigoted of you to wish to deprive triages (for example) of legal recognition of their status as it is for Sir Gerald to wish to deprive you of yours.

If people live together as a family unit then they should be entitled to the protection of the law - end of story. They should be entitled to hospital visiting rights in the case their partner is ill, they should be entitled to legal recognition that they coparent together, and they should be entitled to a fair divorce, should things unfortunately go badly - all this, irrespective of the number in the partnership or their other relationships.

There is *no* burden on the individual(s) concerned to prove anything - to your satisfaction or anyone else's. Fuck you! Should you have to justify your relationship to me, and depend upon my approval? No, of course not!

The purpose of marital law is to allow partners to be legally recognised and to arbitrate disputes between them. The state does not have the right to dictate who or how many people you enter into a partnership with, as long as they're all consenting adults and you're not hurting anyone.

Each plane has a bunch of reactive (explosive) targets attached to the underside, and your goal is to knock out  as many as you can (and/or bring the plane down).

Totally different to shooting clays, and far closer to real game shooting (clays are always slowing down and are relatively slow moving). With the planes you can opt to shoot at targets going as high and as fast as you like.

It's around £1000 a day so you'll need around 20 people to make it cost effective. You shoot in teams of four, taking turns and getting multiple passes until either the plane runs out of explosive targets or you bring it down. With only 5 teams you'll get lots of goes throughout the day with gaps in between to watch everyone else, have a beer, do a BBQ, shoot some trap clays, or whatever.

His work ethic last season was great, he's brilliant at tracking back on defense which allows Johnson to creep forward in attack a bit more. But he's not a 70k a week player. Yes, players like Suarez are on higher wages, but players like Suarez can bag 30 goals a season. 

I'm not riding Hendo because he has years to fulfill the potential which we bought him for. But I will ride Downing who is 29 and quickly running out of any resale value and costing us almost £4M a year to keep on the books.

In my case, years of sucking my thumb left me with a palate the size and shape of my thumb, a massive overbite, and some crazy crowding. It took 6 years of very painful and very expensive dental work to fix. I had braces for 5 years, along with 2 other contraptions designed to reshape your jaw bone, which hurt like a bitch. It was imperative to do this in my childhood, before my bone solidifies, otherwise I would have been left permanently deformed and only very invasive surgery could have made it tolerable (not fixed it). All of this because of a bad habit. Years later, you never would have known I had 4 teeth pulled and my bone remolded. I have near perfect teeth. But that was only the result of nearly 7 years of excruciating work.

It's non sequitur, [2] does not follow [1]. It also requires the premise of ""[0] today we only believe and do things that are correct"" which is plainly false. People are still anti-abortion for example perhaps that's because it goes against the invisible hand of the market. You still get proxy religious groups funding sterilisation for drunks and ne'erdowells whilst preaching about abortion being wrong.

[1] is probably formed from a naive understanding. Motivation was about ensuring and legitimising incumbent power via ideological frameworks, social engineering and market distortions. Eugenicists were also happy breeding the working class because someone has to do the drudgery.

Gove almost certainly subscribes to this ""maxim""—he's still designing children for ""the market"" and building in a mechanism for *deselection*. Elsewhere, Popenoe on ""child labour"":

&gt;  On the parental generation. The children who labor mostly come from poor families, where every child up to the age of economic productivity is an economic burden. If the children go to work at an early age, the parents can afford to have more children and probably will, **since the children soon become to some extent an asset rather than a liability**. Child labor thus leads to a higher birth-rate of this class, abolition of child labor would lead to a lower birth-rate, since the parents could no longer afford to have so many children.

Did a bit of research and found it was possibly an old route for taking stuff from Goa in Mali to Tamanrasset in Algeria.

&gt; It's non sequitur, [2] does not follow [1]. It also requires the premise of ""[0] today we only believe and do things that are correct"" which is plainly false. 

No, it does not require that premise [0]; premise [1] is sufficient to destroy any causal link between the two observations.  Even if we are currently wrong about things, having (at least appeared to) invalidate premises for another argument renders that void - any similarity in outcome is co-incidence - even if a later argument is also wrong!

It's a classic example of 'correlation is not causation'.  Just because there appears to be some points in common, does _not_ mean anything - you need to show a causal link in order for it to be a meaningful observation.  It's a starting point for examination, perhaps - but it's obviously no more than co-incidnce in this case.

If you're trying to argue that premise [1] is incorrect ... you haven't.  You've just asserted that it is incorrect, but not directly addressed the content of it.  

&gt; &gt; enable the teacher to determine just how far it is profitable to educate each child so that he may lead a life of the greatest possible usefulness to the state

&gt; Gove almost certainly subscribes to this ""maxim""

I'm pretty sure he does not.  The current system does _not_ give the teacher the power to make such decision; nor is he proposing anything that might.  The current system of university tuition fees is certainly not designed to maximise value to the state - it's more expensive that previous options; and _discourages_ careers where the average value to the state is higher than others.

If he's trying to do that, he's doing a really bad job of it.

Not sure if it's been posted about before, but here goes:

- New manager, new playing ground to play mind games with
- Jose can offer a ridiculously insulting price for Rooney at maybe 5 to 10 million
- What happens is that papers will pick it up as interest in Rooney
- Rooney thinks he's on his way out again
- Man Utd rejects low bid
- Rooney is pissed, ManUtd fans are pissed, Management are pissed
- Jose, in the end, says that they could have worked something out but transfer window has closed

He was bought 50 million on an 5.5 year contract. Amortised value of the player every year is ~9.1 millions pounds, he has been here for 2.5 years so his value has dropped by ~22.75, making him worth roughly 27.75 on our books, but we only have to register him each year as worth ~9.1  

If he is bought out, it is seen as a transfer, so we would be taking ~27.75 off our books as opposed to say 17.75 if someone bought him for ten million.

Plus his 27.3 million in wages, we'd be staring down the barrell at 40 million pounds worth of player debt already, before we bought any other additional players, the limit this year is 45 million pounds average of debt over the last three years, before sanctions come into place IIRC

Minimum alcohol pricing was either a desperate attempt to look like a solution was being offered to a problem that actually requires vastly more attention than a simple price cap, or they actually through it would help; which means the government really has no idea how a mind gripped by addiction or dependence (typically resulting from substance abuse or mental health issues) actually works.

Crime is mostly a young man's game; crime rates peaked in the mid nineties where we had a generation of young people who had grown up in an unusually bleak economic climate and, with no stake in society, they took their frustrations out upon it. From then up until 2008 things improved steadily and more and more people were too busy with jobs or education to have time to cause trouble. As a result, crime rates fell. And now we have this dreadful situation of a dearth of jobs coupled with cutbacks in higher education.

Having a common enemy provides cohesion and unity to a group, but of course that also requires they they be 'better' than the enemy- which infers the enemy are somehow degenerate or base, in some way 'worse people'.

The good news is that only the most dyed in the wool bigots can keep their hatred going past an encounter with the real 'enemy'. When exposed to homosexuals in reality these people tend to realise they're just ordinary people. They're worried about their jobs, they shop at Tesco, they put their (immaculately fitted) trousers on one leg at a time.

The bigotry will always be around but the institutions that use it are realizing that they need to find another, more distant enemy to target. Someone their adherents are less likely to encounter, but could still be made out to be a huge threat...

Most students take 4 AS levels aged 16, then take 3 of them forward in their second year (aged 17). A good result would be B's, maybe the odd A. Generally your grade in the AS you dropped doesn't really matter, they are more concerned about the 3 A Levels that were taken for the full two years. You must take an A-level in the subject you wish to study. 

For OxBridge, there are higher basic needs to be met. The two friends I have took all 4 of their AS levels to A level. They both achieved straight A's, and have extremely good GCSE's. One of them is already studying 'ahead' for his university subject, which must have gone down well in the interview, the other is a charismatic motherfucker, but not as academic. His personal statement on his application attempted to take a different route, instead of just listing his hobbies or extra curricular achievements, he made it into an epic. Littered with frivolous adjectives - and honestly, it was fun to read.

This is a sweeping statement, but I would say they care less about sports and volunteering - unless its something special, different, or applicable to the course. Saying you have played football for 6 years - is not interesting. They like grades and personality, and especially people showing initiative in the sector they wish to apply too. Be different, be special, be friendly.

Again, I cant compare your grades because they confuse the shit out of me. But if you're hovering around an 'A', are pushing any grades or training hard, and are passionate then you are in good stead.

I haven't said anything about this and legally it shouldn't matter.

\&gt; It's just as bigoted of you to wish to deprive triages (for example) of legal recognition of their status as it is for Sir Gerald to wish to deprive you of yours.

Ah, but it isn't. Keeping the definition of marriage to between 2 people does not discriminate against any *individual* in a way we deem to be unfair. All individuals have the same rights under the law. If you are an unmarried person, you have the same right to marry an unmarried person as any other unmarried person. Sure, we're treating unmarried and married people differently under the law, but that's the whole point of having marriage in the first place! 

Under the old, sexist definition of marriage, different genders did not have the same legal rights, because only a woman could marry a man. The situations are not the same. The conclusion is that banning same sex marriage discriminated in an unfair way, but banning polygamy does not.

\&gt; If people live together as a family unit then they should be entitled to the protection of the law

There is nothing that currently says ""the existing definition of marriage discriminates in an unfair way"". Everyone right now is being treated fairly, so we have no pressing reason to further redefine marriage. The question is why we should do this, and if there are any obvious social problems that would be caused by the redefinition. 

As well as the hugely increased complexity of dealing legally with polygamy, I'd say there *are* obvious social problems that would be caused by introducing it, namely that certain groups of people (Africans, Arabs, Mormons) have cultural norms that use polygamy to let powerful men gather harems, oppress women and treat them like property. I'm very keen that we should not enable these people's shitty cultural norms to perpetuate themselves, so the reasonable position seems that there's no compelling reason to introduce polygamy and quite a few potential downsides.

Let me ask you how you would introduce polygamy without enabling men from shitty, sexist cultures to amass harems.",0,1374143474,null,0,false,0,cb550db,t3_1ii9vf,t1_cb550db,t1_cb4wib6,null,1430425037,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

 My point was adding more people to cope with the strain of an aging population will end you up with more old people, and  more strained public services. It's called logic. The most sensible solution would be to draw immigration back to a sustainable level and to public opinion, and look at ways to provide incentives for young people in this country to get back into work.

&gt; Brendan Rodgers has insisted that Luis Suarez will start next season as a Liverpool player 'unless anything drastic happens'.

&gt; Speaking at a press conference here in Jakarta, Liverpool's manager reinforced his determination to keep the unsettled Uruguay international at Anfield, in light of interest from Arsenal and Real Madrid.

&gt; Earlier this week, Liverpool Managing Director Ian Ayre confirmed that Arsenal are the only club to have made an offer for Suarez but their £30million bid plus add-ons is way short of Liverpool's value of him.

&gt; Rodgers has had almost daily communication with Suarez, who is scheduled to link up with Liverpool on the second leg of their tour in Melbourne next week, throughout the saga and he is resolute in his belief that the 26-year-old will not be sold.

&gt; 'He is a wonderful player,' said Rodgers, whose side face an Indonesian All-Star XI on Saturday. 'And he is still very much a Liverpool player. No matter who the player is, nobody is bigger than Liverpool Football Club.

&gt; 'Luis is a very important member of this squad and I am looking forward to working with him again this season. There has been lots of speculation about Luis moving to another club but, as I said, he is very much a Liverpool player.

&gt; 'We had an offer that was nowhere near what we value him at. Of course he wants to work and play at the top level. But unless something drastic happens, he will be staying here. He has got three years left on his contract.'

&gt; Suarez still has six games to serve of the 10-match ban he received for biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic in April and Rodgers insisted the time had come to move on from the incident

&gt; 'What Luis did was wrong,' said Rodgers. 'He has apologised to me, his team-mates and the supporters. He will serve his punishment and now we have to put it behind us. We will move on and move on together. He was told he was wrong by the football club.'

&gt; Such was the level of interest in the press conference at Liverpool's team hotel, security guards were required to keep the crowds out of the auditorium. More than 300 people were in the room when Rodgers walked in. He was greeted by a round of applause.

&gt; Unsurprisingly, Suarez proved to be the dominant topic but Liverpool's manager was also asked about his side's prospects of reaching the top four next season, the signing she has made so far and the players, like Xabi Alonso, with whom Liverpool have been linked.

&gt; 'The four new players have settled really well and they have looked good in the first two weeks of training. I an really happy with them,' said Rodgers. 'Will I sign an Asian player? At LFC, we just want good players and it does not matter which country they are from.

&gt; 'Asia,South America, Europe... Liverpool is a club that is a world institution. But we only want good players. We must have been linked with 100 players this summer. Xabi Alonso was an  incredible player for this club, a wonderful role model, but he is in a different moment in his career with Real Madrid.'

&gt; On ending Liverpool's four-year absence from the top four, Rodgers added: 'We are fighting to get into the Champions League. The great name and history of Liverpool means we have got to get into that competition. 

&gt; 'It is difficult these days but we have to continue to fight. I believe that we will put up a great fight next season, I really do. Let's hope we can get back to where we belong.'",0,1374144788,null,0,false,0,cb556tr,t3_1ijtrr,t1_cb556tr,t3_1ijtrr,null,1430424951,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Nitpicking on and around the definition of ""teacher"". You are over confident in your powers of argument and you are definitely lacking in historical context. Premise [-1]: ""people don't make the same mistakes twice"".

&gt; The current system of university tuition fees is certainly not designed to maximise value to the state - it's more expensive that previous options; and discourages careers where the average value to the state is higher than others

You still don't get it: it's about mechanisms of **deseletion** and social engineering in favour of the already wealthy. It is undeniable that the system we have and will have resembles closely that lusted after by eugenicists: ""a series of sieves"". The book also has a section on academies. We have obedience training whilst grammar schools are exposed to Duke of Edinburgh and Combined Cadet Forces—I don't think if I went to the local state school I would have shot rifles and flown a light weight aircraft.

&gt; Here's a question for you: Can there ever be a case where an education system can test pupils, whilst you do not see a correlation with the eugenicists?

This is just a rhetorical question. National standardised testing is not required for intellectual advancement it's a factory process of quality control designed for people.

Ultimately though most people are unaware that this history exists, likewise the automobile (a favourite of Hitler remember):

&gt; The growing use of the automobile, which permits a family to live under pleasant surroundings in the suburbs and yet reach the city daily, alleviates the housing problem slightly. Increased facilities for rapid transit are of the utmost importance in placing the city population (a selected class, it will be remembered) under more favorable conditions for bringing up their children. Zone rates should be designed to effect this dispersal of population.

This still holds today: 20-25% of households today don't have a car thus there still exists poor people that have a restricted access to the good jobs and desirable amenities. Poor kids play in the local bus shelter, in the road or near the corner shop.

Eugenicists wanted to make life hard for the poor and easy for the rich, now doesn't that still sound relevant today? There will undoubtedly be legacy issues with a system that was designed in such bad faith.

My actual argument is as follows:

0. Gove wants free schools,
* people are agitating for free schools to have a method of deselection,
* free schools will need standardised testing at an earlier age for that to happen.

Well-off parents can afford private teachers to juice the grades of their kids over others. Hello institutionalised inequality! What else is the Conservative mindset agitating for?

Crime is mostly a young man's game; crime rates peaked in the mid nineties where we had a generation of young people who had grown up in an unusually bleak economic climate and, with no stake in society, they took their frustrations out upon it. From then up until 2008 things improved steadily and more and more people were too busy with jobs or education to have time to cause trouble. As a result, crime rates fell. And now we have this dreadful situation of a dearth of jobs coupled with cutbacks in higher education. This will create a huge number of unemployed men in their twenties, which will not be good for the crime statistics.

What the UK needs is a large tax paying work force to pay for the ageing population. The OBR has calculated that the current number of working age adults will not be able to support the number of retirees without leaving a huge black hole in the public finances. Immigrants would **supplement** the British work force and take very little back in terms of services. It could be easy enough to attract those people of working age with incentives but deincentivise staying in the UK until death.

The massive restructuring of pension plans will also make the next generation of retirees much more self sustainable - no more final salary pensions, sensible pension investments and people working to a later age will all reduce the issue in the long term. This current generation are an example of ill thought out long term planning with retirement.

As for listening to public opinion about immigration, I direct you here:

125 calories = 1 unit    
151 calories = 2 units    
266 calories = 3 units    

etc. 

Recommendation would be for men to have 22 units, women 20 units. 

The theory being that no one can be bothered to work out 244 + 200 + 124 + 255 + 533 = 1356. 

Much easier to work out and remember 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 5 = 13..

Then a second stage would be putting the teaching of this method into the school system. Maybe 30 minutes in PSHE class at schools. Once when they're in primary school, then again in secondary school. 

Along with the showing of the new 'units' prominently on the front of packaging (with no option for 'per portion' nonsense) there would be a QR code with all the nutritional content printed in it.

-------------Lloris

Holtby has Walker, Bale and Adebayor to aim for, Dembele and Verts push Rose up for Sig to cut inside.

This overloads the left hand side. And on the 60th minute for defensive substitutions:

--------------Lloris

true,Kainotomiu,eng-devon,Devon,"I thought this was relevant. It's the description of British POWs in Kurt Vonnegut's *Slaughterhouse Five*.

&gt;A guard knocked on a door.

&gt;The door was flung open from inside. Light leaped out through the door, escaped from prison at 186,000 miles per second. Out marched fifty middle-aged Englishmen. They were singing ""Hail, Hail, the Gang's All Here"" from the *Pirates of Penzance*.

&gt;****

&gt;These lusty, ruddy vocalists were among the first English-speaking prisoners to be taken in the Second World War. Now they were singing to nearly the last. They had not seen a woman or child for four years or more. They hadn't seen any birds, either. Not even sparrows would come into the camp.

&gt;The Englishmen were officers. Each of them had attempted to escape from another prison at least once. Now they were here, dead-center in a sea of dying Russians.

&gt; They could tunnel all the pleased. They would inevitably surface within a rectangle of barbed wire, would find themselves greeted listlessly by dying Russians who spoke no English, who had no food or useful information or escape plans of their own. They could scheme all they pleased to hide aboard a vehicle or steal one, but no vehicle ever came into their compound. They could feign illness, if they likes, but that wouldn't earn them a trip anywhere, either. The only hospital in the camp was the six-bed affair in the British compound itself.

&gt;The Englishmen were clean and enthusiastic and decent and strong. They sang boomingly well. They had been singing together every night for years. 

&gt;The Englishmen had also been lifting weights and chinning themselves for years. Their bellies were like washboards. The muscles of their calves and upper arms were like cannonballs. They were all masters of checkers and chess and bridge and cribbage and dominoes and anagrams and charades and Ping-Pong and billiards, as well.

&gt;They were among the wealthiest people in Europe, in terms of food. A clerical error early in the war, when food was still getting through to prisoners, had caused the Red Cross to ship them five hundred parcels every month instead of fifty. The Englishmen had hoarded these so cunningly that now, as the war was ending, they had three tons of sugar, one ton of coffee, eleven hundred pounds of chocolate, seven hundred pounds of tobacco, seventeen hundred pounds of tea, two tons of flour, one ton of canned beef, twelve hundred pounds of canned butter, sixteen hundred pounds of canned cheese, eight hundred pounds of powdered milk, and two tons of orange marmalade.

&gt; They had kept all this in a room without windows. They had ratproofed it by lining it with flattened tin cans.

&gt;****

&gt;They were adored by the Germans, who thought they were exactly what Englishmen ought to be. They made war look stylish and reasonable, and fun. So the Germans let them have four sheds, though one shed would have held them all. And, in exchange for coffee or chocolate or tobacco, the Germans gave them paint and lumber and nails and cloth for fixing things up.

&gt;The Englishmen had known for twelve hours that American guests were on their way. They had never had guests before, and they went to work like darling elves, sweeping, mopping, cooking, baking--making mattresses of straw and burlap bags, setting tables, putting party favors at each place.

&gt;Now they were singing their welcome to their guests in the winter night. Their clothes were aromatic with the feast they had been preparing. They were dressed half for battle, half for tennis or croquet. They were so elated by their own hospitality, and by all the goodies waiting inside, that they did not take a good look at their guests while they sang. And they imagined that they were singing to fellow officers fresh from the fray.

&gt;They wrestled the Americans toward the shed door affectionately, filling the night with manly blather and brotherly rodomontades. They called them ""Yank,"" told them ""Good show,"" promised them that ""Jerry was on the run,"" and so on.

&gt;Billy Pilgrim wondered dimly who Jerry was.

Compare him to a player like, say, Berbatov. You often get the impression in a game that Berbatov is basically standing in between the centre circle and the penalty area smoking a Gitaine. 

Rooney works hard. He drops deep to pick up the ball. He peels wide to create space for others. These are all admirable things, and don't mean he doesn't have skill - he has plenty - but they characterise his game. As his body changes, as age takes a grip, his ability to do these things will shrink. 

I strongly suspect that Rooney will struggle to adapt. Just my opinion, mind. A move may be the thing he needs to get him back to the blazing force of nature he once was. But I also don't think he's suited to be a lone striker, which is effectively how Mourinho teams play. He has the strength but not, I think, the presence. I could see him sitting behind or alongside a player like Lukaku, but - let's be honest - we have 6 players capable of doing that.

So do you think it's ok for the raped kid to suffer and remember it for the rest of his life, while the cunt in prison will forget what he's in for after a year, and then 3 years later gets released.

In regards to terrorists, do you think it's ok that the person who orchestrated a terrorist attack that killed hundreds has to be treated same way as someone who stole a car?

They've waived their human rights by committing their terrible crimes. That's my opinion. 

This rapist kid will end up being a legend in the correctional facility, because other inmates will praise him for being so cruel and saying the things he said. He will not be punished at all. All that happens is that he will be temporarily removed from the society, and when he gets out the only people he will know are other criminals.

What happened to human rights of people that are victims? Oh yeah, we can't undo the past so it doesn't matter.

The only analogy I can think of here is ""fire and forget"". Here's the application, we've notified all relevant media of it's existence -- it's up to the PC to reject in order to give us the story we've prepared. 

I'm assuming, but the goal here is to make the PC look anti-OO. I doubt the headcases will read and understand the PC reply, and will only come away with the line being parroted out by people who really should know better.

Have you tried claim subsidy to switch your OFCH to something more eco friendly recently? It's the biggest headache I've ever encountered with more paperwork than anyone could imagine, for something that should be a foregone conclusion. I don't agree with filling in 6x forms (and counting), numerous phonecalls (and counting) -- but it has to be done, or it will never happen. The OO know the requirements, and have simply decided to ignore it. Whether it be that they don't believe it's within the PC's power to make this decision, or feel that the PC is biased against them, or any other reason. They lodged the application and refused supporting evidence. That can only result in one outcome.

true,Colinfucius,lfc99,,"Great point. As always, news is part of the entertainment industry, and even the most respected publications will throw their principles out the door when it comes to the transfer window so that they can drive traffic to their sites and generate ad revenue. 

It's shocking, I know, but ""Arsenal to Take a Bite Out of Liverpool's Top Four Hopes with Shock Bid for Controversial Star Striker"" is somehow generating more website visits than ""Liverpool Have No Good Reason to Sell Best Player to Rival With No Realistic Way to Attract Replacement.""

Here's why we won't sell Suarez this summer, and you can tag me:

To attract the best players, you need CL football. To earn CL football in England, you need the best players. Because of this catch-22, you have three options to break through: have an incredible academy (#TeamOfCarraghers), spot talent that somehow everyone else has missed or undervalued (#TeamOfCoutinhos), or have superstars left over from previous success or attracted to Liverpool for its size and legacy.

Once you have these players you **must hold on to them until you make CL football**. Period. If you give them away before you're playing in Europe, **you will not be able to attract quality replacements** without an Arab sugar-daddy.

Suarez' creativity simply cannot be replaced, even if we got 60 million for him, especially with so much striker talent already locked up this window. The stats speak for themselves: 30 goals, 85 chances created, etc, but let's really talk here. We've all seen him play: Luis Suarez is phenomenal. He's the best player on the pitch. He's a nightmare for defenses. He's a sniper on free kicks. He's passionate, intelligent, and works his ass off. He's *exactly* what we need to make top four this year, and everyone in our organization knows it.

It's up to us, not him, and we're not going to sell our only real chance at the CL this season, *especially* to a top four rival. Everything I've seen about Rodgers, Ayre, and FSG thus far tells me they understand this, and this article is further proof of that. Luis is going to have to bite the bullet for one more year, because he will be leading the charge for Liverpool and our return to glory this upcoming season.",0,1374161183,null,0,false,0,cb59cwk,t3_1ik2kv,t1_cb59cwk,t1_cb5779w,null,1430422987,63,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,63

* Vikings (as the only people to ever successfully invade, so it's considered important)

* Ottoman Empire

* British Empire including the formation and losses of colonies in America and Australia

* Various British wars, including: War of the Roses, Civil War, Boer War, Hundred Years' War, and both World Wars

* Endless tedium about the Industrial Revolution

* Elizabethan England

* Victorian England

* The Tudors

* William the Conqueror / Battle of Hastings

* The Titanic

Some praise...

&gt;The beauty of Austin is you don’t have to build the team around him. Whereas a year ago we were still uncertain as to how to get the best out of Rodriguez – now a £7 million Premier League player – Austin could fit into any side and bang them in on a regular basis

&gt;Just get the ball in dangerous areas and he’ll do the rest.

And some prophecies that came true...
&gt; Most Clarets expect Austin to be our top scorer next season, comfortably so. And you wouldn’t get many who’d bet against him being among the league’s top strikers come May.

&gt;He is unfairly talented and I’d be shocked if he never plays Premier League football. Only injury can stop him from going all the way.
