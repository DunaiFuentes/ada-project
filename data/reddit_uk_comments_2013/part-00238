This would be LEGAL in the UK and would have happened any time between their birth and when they were 7 or 8 years old.

At one point, one of the young men becomes very upset indeed, and has to sit down outside. He starts mumbling about how terrible it is and how no one should do such things to a ""child"". Then at 26:45 he mumbles about ""men"" (note that it's women doing the mutilating). Is he recalling his own suffering?

Why was no mentioned made of the fact that all those young men have suffered themselves? The author and presenter of the documentary had her external glans clitoris amputated by her mother when she was a young girl. She would have lost around 8,000 nerve endings.

Libya was, ultimately, a western effort to force out Ghadaffi even though it was explicitly not in the UN mandate. 

Then you spring in defence of Syria, but seem to forget the fact we haven't actually done anything about it. 

On top of that, you seem to lack an understanding of the UK's military history. We were involved in more wars in the 20th century than any other nation, to the point where even the US got so pissed at us in the Suez crisis they threatened to torpedo our economy. 

World War I was a battle of empires, and World War II was a merging of several conflicts, spurred largely by territorial disputes regarding (in a more complex way) our colonies overseas and the after effects of our repressive and punitive actions which left Germany unstable after World War I. We also invented concentration camps and the techniques of displacing indigenous populations to reinforce colonial rule. 

We are not the good guys historically. 

Finally, your comments about 'self defence' of us or an ally are totally bogus. We've not been under direct threat of invasion for half a century. That ended with the establishment of NATO and nuclear deterrent. When we've 'gone to the aid of allies' I can only assume you mean Korea? Unless you think Gulf I, II and Afghan were the result of treaty violations? The Falklands, which you may reach for here, is a great example of why this stance is bogus, because we went straight to war as almost our first resort. Time and again we see force as a valid recourse for the 'defence of allies', a stretched definition, which totally undermines the key role of diplomacy and peaceful resolution - to the point where these days, all we do is threaten force and consider it justified to use it if people dare be resistant to that. 

I'm sorry, but the key message of remembrance day always should be that war is a bad thing. It's all about the individual human suffering of conflicts, and how brave and unfortunate so many hundreds of thousands of British citizens (and how many hundreds of millions across the world) are to have suffered through that. The meaningless jingoistic political aspects of 'they died for our freedom!' and such are a disgusting sideshow that should not be allowed to shape the event and its meaning. 

People suffered and died horribly. We should do everything we can to prevent that happening, at all times. ",0,1383955776,null,0,1383956768,0,cda18ny,t3_1q65sd,t1_cda18ny,t1_cd9sbte,null,1428734125,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

I think that a lot of us have known or suspected that this stuff has been going on for years and, whilst it certainly *doesn't* make it right, it seems to me that GCHQ are in something of an untenable position where the public is concerned.

They're certainly not supposed to be dicks who spy on everything that you and I do (and fuck knows why they'd want to,) but I don't think it's realistic to think that any country's intelligence service should be the completely transparent ""good guys"". They operate in shades of grey by their very definition. We appear to need far better oversight, that better serves the people of the UK but I think that has more to do with the government, no matter who is in power, than the intelligence services themselves.

I have read accounts from the Falklands conflicts where Paras gunned down/bayonetted argentine troops who were trying to surrender, but in those situations, they were not in the position (according to the book I was reading) to be able to accept those prisoners, as it was in the middle of a firefight. It left me with a sour taste, but I understood it. You can't leave an enemy soldier alone and unguarded while you fight his mates, and not worry about him stabbing you in the back, and similarly, dropping a man or 2, to put them on guard duty could cost you a battle. It's a tough choice, one that I certainly wouldn't want to have to make.

I think though, that if there is a possibility to save a life, it should be taken. That is something that would set us apart from these terrorists or insurgents, or enemy combatants or whatever we are calling them.

To my eye, it looks like they could have made an effort to save this fellow, without much danger to themselves. They chose a bullet to the chest instead. Legally, it was wrong, and in my opinion, morally too.

But other things ARE a matter of national security and strategic advantage, and should be kept secret.

However, questions like, ""would it be okay for them to spy on Afghan citizens to determine if they are terrorists?"" should show where problems come up. If its okay to do it to Afghan citizens (which I don't think would be too unpopular an idea in the West, unfortunately), then why not on our closer allies' citizens as well?

Yeah of course it's crap.

I don't know how these (nominally) friendly organisations are supposed to operate in the modern world, given the sheer amount of data that's available to all and sundry but this clearly isn't right. It feels to me that somebody's seriously dropped the ball where quality control is concerned and that's something that needs to be immediately addressed. I admit that I'm inclined to give those people who are actually acting in the interests of the nation's security the benefit of the doubt, as if I don't it feels like paranoia will take over, but those things which are deemed ""unsavoury"" when looking at the proposed internet opt-out scheme (""esoteric materials""- really?) smack of a civil servant with too much time on their hands to me, and seem to be part and parcel of the same scared system that thinks terror is everywhere. How it's possible to feel that way and not accept that the ""terrorists"", whomever they may be, have already won, is beyond me.

I deny them all and after denying it, the proper connection comes up. Such as Immunicity wants to connect to App store on port 80 for example which quite concerns me. I was wary of this and switched the auto proxy off as I was paying a bill by card on Chrome and thought that they could capture my details. I don't know but the fact that you follow the set up instructions on a Mac and to save the proxy on Chrome it makes you load it as an Automatic Proxy Configuration, system wide and not just in Chrome's settings but my whole wifi that we should be more suspicious of their actions.

true,newbill123,null,null,"* Time: 8 seconds (plus a 5 second ad at the end that's not from the story)

* Speaking characters: 1 off-screen, 1 on-screen

* Total words spoken: 7

* Intent of scene: to drum up curiosity and confusion about what's going on.

* Probable Placement in the story: It seems like a fairly early scene during the typical setup of a Doctor Who story where the audience is still trying to understand what's going on, rather than a pivotal or twist scene in a more critical part of the story.

When the story airs, what might we find that could be considered ""spoilers"" in retrospect:

* The biggest one: an unexpected item is revealed, possibly its creator, its current location, or the item itself may be what's unexpected in the story. Fans will undoubtedly speculate about the item, but the clip itself is not long enough to even fully understand what's significant about what is being revealed other than being unexpected.

* The second biggest one: one background character we have not seen before is easily identifiable as something other than a throwaway character. The indicator itself is superficial and probably not a significant other than perhaps just its presence. To be honest, I didn't even notice the indicator when I first watched the clip, but when you notice it, you'll know the indicator clearly wasn't just *coincidentally* used in a Doctor Who story.

* Minor throw-away possibility: The location may be out of place for the characters. Nothing special about the location is revealed, and nothing special about the background characters is revealed, but there's a minor bit of incongruity about the two together. This happens all the time in a Doctor Who story and may not have even entered into the creators thoughts that this was unusual though.

* A minor possibility - The off-screen spoken line may create speculation about who is speaking it (actor and character), but the line itself is very short and says nothing about the speaker.

My recommendation: Watch it once to see what everyone is talking about. Fans will undoubtedly over-analyze it, so see it yourself so you aren't tempted to read the fan speculation. It's not that critical or puzzling a scene, but if it raises excessively high speculation or fan expectations that's where it could hurt.

Susan, a fellow Gallifreyan (Time Lord?). It's absolutely certain she's aware of regeneration.

Polly and Ben, both witnessed the regeneration of the First Doctor into the Second.

The Brigadier is explained the concept of regeneration (and then later witnesses another regeneration and meets several incarnations). He's *well* aware of regeneration.

Jo Grant witnesses the Eleventh Doctor and is explained the concept of regeneration, but does not actually witness the event.

Sarah Jane Smith witnesses a regeneration.

Romana, a fellow Time Lord, is well aware of regeneration and actually does so herself.

K-9 meets several Doctors but is not explained the nature of regeneration (likely because he already knows).

Adric, Nyssa, and Tegan all help the Fourth Doctor out after his regeneration into the Fifth. They're well aware of regeneration.

Peri is present for the Fifth Doctor's regeneration into the Sixth. 

Mel is passed out for the event of regeneration, but is explained the Doctor's capability to do so later.

Grace does not witness, but is explained the process of regeneration, as is Chang (if you wanna count him too).

Rose witnesses a regeneration, Jack also understands regeneration when he meets both Nine and Ten as do Jackie and Mickey.

Martha is explained the process of regeneration in *42*, but does not seemingly understand the true meaning of what the Doctor is saying. However, by *The Sound of Drums* she is well-aware that Time Lords can regenerate, as she's been ""searching"" for a ""Time Lord killing gun"".

River knows about regeneration and has done so herself.

Amy and Rory witness a false Doctor enter into regeneration and then be killed. They also witness the regeneration of Mels into River, implying that they are aware Time Lords can regenerate.

Clara may know the Doctor can regenerate, depending on whether or not she has full awareness of her many forms after hopping into the Time Scar.

This leaves Ian, Barbara, Vicki, Sarah Kingdom, Katarina, Dodo, Victoria, Zoe, Jamie, Liz, Leela, Harry, Turlough, Kamelion, Ace, and Donna all totally unaware that the Doctor can regenerate, if we count mind wipes.

yeah, that's not true.  Behaviors may change, but personality?  No.  Just because I am on a drug doesn't mean I stop liking baseball, or that classic rock is my favorite type of music, or that I prefer Audi to Chevrolet.  A person's behavior can be altered through chemicals, but it takes massive trauma or experiences that are life changing to truly change someone - but even then could you say their personality is completely changed?  No, because that is subjective and relies on individual cases rather than a gross generalization.  Same with drugs and chemical changes to the brain.

I've also got to point out that I've been a fan for about 30 years now and no-one used to give a shit about calling the character Doctor Who; it seems to be a habit of people who didn't grow up with the show, or maybe people just want to pick a fight these days.

I've spent considerable time there, on East and West coasts and in the middle, and it's a remarkably uniform country, socially and politically. Of course the weather in Seattle, WA is different from the weather in Charlotte, NC and of course the social attitudes in Manhattan are somewhat different from those in Minneapolis, but America is a real thing. Compared to the differences between, say, Warsaw and Lisbon, or Aberdeen and Palermo America is very uniform.

The thing about Normandy being 3 hours away is silly. *Barfleur* takes more than two hours to get between Poole and Cherbourg, and you have to be in Poole to start with, but you're in, as I recall, Cambridge and you aren't getting from Cambridge to Poole in an hour in anything other than a chartered helicopter. To go all the way from Cambridge to Cherbourg on a train would take about 8 hours and it would be about the same to drive *if* there were no traffic hold-ups at all.

The reason that Europeans think that 100 miles is a long way is that it takes us a *long time* to get around.

Pirlo is the extra man as far as wages and dependence is concerned in the Juventus midfielder. It's why Juve are willing to listen to offers, it's why those older player sniffers are coming in (Turkish Clubs). This Pirlo rumour has been bounded around consistently for over a month. With more clubs adding to the list slowly.

Pirlo is on rather large wages, more than Pogba's. I wouldn't mind betting he took a pay cut when signing from his free. Even so, he's still being overpaid for his role at Juve. So Juve just want to sell. The only clubs that want him are those that can afford his wages. That's almost nobody in the Italian League, Inter could just about afford him and would fit in with Cambiasso but wouldn't get in the way developmentally with Kovacic.

It basically raises questions which The Guardian has absolutely not addressed in its coverage - such as, how do we know this information is safe in their hands, and who are they to decide what gets revealed and what doesn't? In the programme, Rusbridger makes it clear he thinks he is up to the job of being gatekeeper. I'm not entirely sure what qualifies him to decide if something is too secret to be published, or not. I think it's important to challenge him, and not just accept this pre-conceived view that his paper is being heroic and doing a public service.

I think to ask whether things are less safe, whether terrorists have been given an advantage, as a result of these leaks is absolutely valid. To reject this and say 'there's no evidence to suggest this is the case', which seems to be the Greenwald line, is bollocks - he doesn't have any evidence to back his claim, either.

There are companies which buy and sell IP addresses for specific home addresses - all you need to do is tick the 'accept' box on the terms and conditions, and you've given them that right. It's data protection which needs reviewing, and it would make this so called 'surveillance' much, much harder. 

You have the likes of Google putting on this show of being 'open', by revealing how many requests they had from intelligence agencies for data - reflecting any claim of 'bad guy' - but Google are the motherfuckers who are saving all this information!

&gt;I noticed this is from the Scottish government. Looking on the internet it seems to be a case of the Scottish government making a one sided argument to stirr shit up as usual.

&gt;http://www.thescottishfarmer.co.uk/news/deal-made-on-cap-reform.22645517

&gt;On Scottish farmers website their article says:

&gt;&gt;The closest thing to an objective analysis of the deal on the table came from the National Farmers Union Scotland, which noted that, despite hopes that more might have been forthcoming, Scottish farming's share of the UK's CAP budget was to remain unchanged

&gt;&gt;...that will allow Scotland the ability couple up to 10 percent of its budget rather than 8 percent limit currently set.""That is a welcome flexibility and we must decide how best Scottish farming could target that uplift to benefit our industry. ""The slight uplift in the Pillar 2 funding comes as a relief, given that we were facing a budgetary cut. That should now take off some of the pressure for a transfer of funds from direct support into the rural development pot.""

&gt;http://www.farmersguardian.com/home/hot-topics/cap-reform/uk-government-rejects-scottish-calls-for-cap-budget-increase/60054.article

&gt;&gt;The Government has announced that the four UK regions will receive the same proportion of the €27.6 billion CAP budget over the next seven years as they currently receive.

&gt; &gt;Mr Lochhead has called for Scotland to be awarded all of what he said was a €220m increase to the UK budget granted on the back Scotland’s current low payments. However, following what it said was extensive consultation with the devolved administrations, the Government has concluded that the overall reduction in CAP (equating to 12.6 per cent in real terms over the 2014-2020 period) will be shared equally between the four UK administrations.

&gt;&gt;In what is being seen an as attempt to soften the blow for Scotland, the UK Government is remaining open to allowing Scotland to use some of the UK’s unused quota of coupled subsidy, subject to approval by the European Commission. If permitted, this could enable Scotland to go beyond its current limit upper limit of 8 per cent coupled subsidies under the reformed CAP.


&gt;So essentially the UK government kept to the current structure to make sure that the taxpayers pie is split evenly between all regions of the UK, with Scotland having the chance of getting some extra slices. The Scottish government wanted all of the pie and now they're throwing a hissy fit. The Scottish farmers are taking it on the chin.

&gt;Worst part of this? The SNP is clearly going against the grain of UKs policy towards CAP. The UK wants to cut CAP because it's taxpayers money used to subsidise 2% of the EU's workforce, while the SNP wants an increase

However you see its not as straight forward as it seems. I don't know anything about it myself but I'm passing on the top comment in another thread. ",0,1383988194,null,0,false,0,cda9xtz,t3_1q6ua8,t1_cda9xtz,t3_1q6ua8,null,1428729997,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

I've done most of my motorway driving on the M1 between Nottingham and Leicester so it's mostly 70mph+ traffic.

I drive in lots of small villages where the roads can barely accommodate a single lane. I'm impressed by the courtesy and common sense shown by other drivers to let people past. When I arrived, I actively looked for damage to cars. i.e. scrapes on the sides of cars. I was amazed that I didn't see any evidence of that.

The sheer number of roundabouts is a nightmare but people tend to be very cautious on them here. In Australia, it's first-come-first-served on a roundabout. Here, I've noticed, that people tend to treat the smaller roundabouts like a normal turn. i.e. give way to your right.

I've had several occasions where I've had an oncoming car wishing to turn right in front of me. The other car was going to be first at the roundabout. The other car stops and *waits* for me even though they were first at the roundabout. I see that they're waiting, I get confused, so I just keep going and let them make up their mind when they wish to turn ...

The other car then flashes their lights, beeps their horn and the driver makes an angry face at me ...

It took me a while to work out that people didn't assume they had right of way, even though they were first at the roundabout. A friend of mine who came to visit said the exact same thing and he's a brilliant driver (semi-professional rally driver).

true,YourLizardOverlord,eng-sussex,Scotland --&gt; West Sussex,"&gt;To be honest I think that it's up to the medical professionals.

That makes sense. Specifically, it should be up to the GP practice that the person being assessed is registered with. This was the case before the Work Capability Assessment was introduced. The GP practice  will have a detailed knowledge of the disabled person's history and condition that no one-off assessment could hope to match.

The current Work Capability Assessment is particularly bad because it creates perverse incentives to certify people as fit for work who clearly aren't. [Government statistics reveal that between January 2010 and January 2011, 10,600 sick and disabled people people died within six weeks of their benefits having been ended.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Capability_Assessment#Dangerous_Conclusions_And_Deaths) 

&gt;And I don't think it is honourable of people like Toynbee to make political points based on us feeling sorry for terminal cancer patients. It's so incredibly cheap. While terminal cancer sounds terrible and scary, many people with terminal cancer lead normal lives for years. It doesn't automatically qualify you as unfit to work, and neither does being disabled, paralysed, deaf, missing limbs or any of the other tragic cases that the press seems to enjoy trotting out.

Toynbee clearly has  a massive axe to grind, but in this case she is entirely justified. 

Of course disability doesn't automatically qualify you as unfit to work, though some people need a bit of support. There's nothing to stop a disabled person who believes that they are fit for work declining an assessment and taking a job.

This could and should be made part of the system. A disabled person should be allowed to apply for a job, and if it doesn't work out, they should resume being paid benefits with no questions asked. This single reform would take the risk out of a disabled person trying for a job, and would do more to get disabled people into work than anything that's being tied at the moment. But recent governments seem to prefer sticks to carrots.

&gt;As far as I understand the current system, people who are disabled get notes from a doctor about whether they are fit to work, and what sort of work they are able/not able to do.

They get a report from what ATOS loosely terms a ""health professional"" who has a narrow prescriptive range of criteria and a perverse incentive to find people fit for work when they clearly aren't.

true,duncanlock,null,null,"The more I drive in other places, the more I think that road safety is systemic and requires effort at all levels, from nose to tail, people to tarmac.

I grew up in the UK and moved to Canada (BC) at the age of ~30, a few years ago.

The roads in the UK are, by comparison *extremely* well maintained. The signage is *out-of-this-world* better. The lighting - on almost all roads - is almost night and day, literally.

I have driven in and around France, Belgium, Greece, The USA and parts of Germany. I have been driven around in Turkey, Spain, Costa Rica, Italy - and several other places.

Germany has good roads - very good; probably as good as the roads in the UK. No one else, in my experience, seems to spend as much time, effort and money - on making their road infrastructure itself as safe. The UK spends a lot of cash maintaning the road network and its extensive safety furniture and surrounding ecosystems - Excellent lighting, signage, reflective road markings, [cats eyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat's_eye_(road)), rumble strips, drainage, CCTV Police &amp; Rescue Coverage, tough driving tests, peridoic mandatory vehice exams, harsh penalties and public education against drink driving, etc...

People living in the UK love to moan about... everything - but drive in other countries and you'll see what I mean.

Partly this is in response to the huge volume and density of traffic in the UK - and in response to a historically poor record, back in the 70's.

Some places have part of the package - French roads are fantastic, for example - except for an amazing lack of signage. You can be driving down a fairly large 3 or 4 lane road in rural France and pass a large tee junction, with smaller roads leaving the main road - with no signage whatsoever. Hmmm. If that road *actually* didn't go anywhere, it wouldn't *be* there. In Canada, you can be diving along a freeway knowing you need to take an exit soon and the only sign you see it *at the exit* - literally *right there*. No sign a five miles before, then a mile before, then 500m before, then at the exit. No. Just one, when it's too late. The road signs in BC are like confirmations for people who already know where they're going; yep, that was the right turning.

This seems like a pretty simple thing - and it is - but it makes people drive in a much more hesitant, more erratic and more dangerous way around junctions. People are surprised, baffled or trying to make snap judgements with too little information.

This simple thing - signage - compounded with similar problems in other areas - lighting, road surface, markings, etc... make a big difference to overall  safety.

It's not until you try driving elsewhere for a while that you realise how good the roads in the UK actually are.",0,1383994272,null,0,false,0,cdaaoba,t3_1q7ewn,t1_cdaaoba,t3_1q7ewn,null,1428729653,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

[The Telegraph has a better written article which includes the following:](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/champions-league/10437687/BT-Sport-claims-victory-over-Sky-after-paying-900m-for-rights-to-show-Champions-League-and-Europa-League.html)

&gt; As revealed by Telegraph Sport, BT Sport committed to making certain matches available free-to-air across both the Champions League and Europa League – including both finals – a tactic it has already employed with its Premier League coverage... 

&gt;  ...with BT Sport committing only to showing each British club free-to-air once per season. 

It's also interesting to see how far Sky were prepared to go to prevent BT from winning the bid:
&gt;  So determined were Sky to prevent BT Sport adding the world’s biggest annual sports tournament to its roster, it is thought there was even the prospect of it breaking the bank and sub-letting some matches to ITV to satisfy Uefa’s desire for some level of free-to-air coverage.

It's a mixture of courtesy but then anger when the other person (me) doesn't abide by the unwritten rules. e.g. the oncoming car appears to wait (courteous) for me to slow down and let them go through the mini-roundabout even though they arrived first. When I don't stop to let them through, they get angry because I ""cheated"" at the courtesy rules. I can understand this, but it's not *instinctive* for me yet.

Colin Baker is most fans' least favorite, but not because of Colin Baker...
The Costume, the horrendous plot, so much wrong with the 6th Doctor, but not the actor.  He was joking in this video.  

I think that the decision to not include classic doctors, has more to do with budget.  (which is also why I think Eccleston isn't involved.  He possibly wanted more money than the BBC would pay for one past Doctor.)
Each of these actors have had a starring role as The Doctor and would want to be compensated as such.

I do recognize that perhaps the BBC has spent way too much to acquire John Hurt, and on all of the promotion and other celebratory media.

But 'The Classic Doctor' actors should have some role.  From what I've seen, I don't believe they were even asked if they would be willing to work for cheap. Even being able to be involved in 'The Doctors Revisited' would be something.  I agree with the other posts that advise cameos for them.  But NOT starring roles as their former Doctor selves.

I do think they could get around the age/weight/appearance issue with makeup, wigs, and special effects, (and maybe some minor plot device) with the exception of perhaps Tom Baker.  But if you're using that much budget, it's easier just to CGI. Which is why I'd rather see off-role Cameos.  I felt 'Time Crash' was pushing it when it comes to trying to pass off an aged actor as their younger Doctor.  It's okay for a 5 minute 'bonus'....but not for a feature story, and especially not for the biggest story of the modern era.

Most Doctors were brought back for the Big Finish Audio dramas, which is something at least...but we're a visual bunch as well, and with all of the hype, it would be nice to see them.

If I was an exec at BBC I'd say that I'd like to see new actors cast as the classic doctors, and involve the original actors in the casting process, AND give them cameos as Time Lords.  And as much as I love John Hurt and Billie Piper, I'd take their paycheck and ask Eccleston to name his price.  Most of us in the US would much rather see him as The Doctor than as Malekith or Destro...even though he played those roles pretty well.",0,1383998104,null,0,false,0,cdab3ln,t3_1q6ndu,t1_cdab3ln,t3_1q6ndu,null,1428729455,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Similarly, the House could stop any raw deals pushed through the Senate by a confederation of Scottish senators from affecting the entire area either.

I struggle to see how having Hebridean policy decided by greater London is very democratic either. As it stands we're four separate countries trying to co-exist as a single nation, with three countries having to go with whatever the fourth dictates. To my mind, this can only lead to dissatisfaction, given the differences in population, politics, culture and economies between us.

Furthermore, I do picture the UK government in this system only really having a say on foreign policy, defence and a few related taxes. Issues such as the ones I imagine you are talking about would preferably be handled by the Scottish parliament.

The law exists to take this sort of nonsense out of the equation.  Furthermore, the man that was executed had not just executed the soldiers family.  Furthermore, the death sentence is not used by the British justice system today.  Furthermore, soldiers taking the law in to their own hands displays a complete disregard for discipline-they are not doing their job properly.

What's your take on the issue of commuter parking outside the centre? I ask because the council is trying to put residents' parking into place in Clifton, charging more than 4x as much as it does in Cotham or Kingsdown, and citing the issue of people parking in Clifton then getting buses to the centre or even the airport. What this means is that people who don't even live in the city are clogging it up; is residents' parking the answer? As a resident I'm fine with the concept (except that as the second person in a flat with one parking space, I'd have to pay a fortune for my permit because two separate individual professionals can't POSSIBLY need two cars?!) but as a manager in a reasonably tourist-driven pub I'm very aware that Clifton would suffer terribly from genuine tourists being unable to park in the village. 

I have a car but unless I'm going outside the city I walk 99% of the time, because it's easy, safe, free and I don't have to park.

Christ! I would recommend for you a car ;)

A Harley or similar cruiser is probably a good shout for long hauls, something with wind protection, a comfy seat, and heated grips etc. A Goldwing would be another good option, but they are a touch expensive. You could look at the Honda Deauville, I've heard it's basically a baby Goldwing, it's not quite sport tourer but is a ""sporty tourer"", which might be good if you still want to go fast once in a while.

It might also be worth looking at Adventure style bikes. a BMW1200GS or one of the smaller runners up. People go round the world on them so they should be good for Wales to Scotland. Probably not as comfortable as a cruiser or similar though.

true,Arkyl,null,null,"&gt;Scottish farmers will be deprived of hundreds of millions of euros in European subsidies that is rightfully theirs following today’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) budget announcement by the UK Government.


Well no, it's not, it's up to the UK to decide how to determine who get's the money. Scotland has no birthright to this money. 


&gt;The UK Government’s decision not to award up to €230 million between 2014 -2020 of CAP funding known as the ‘convergence uplift’ to Scotland goes against the wishes of both the Scottish Parliament and the European Union.


The EU hasn't expressed an opinion actually, the money was just determined based on a formula, and the money was distributed to the UK to determine how to use it. Scotland had a say in this.

&gt;The only reason that the UK qualifies for the uplift is because of Scotland’s low payments under the current system. However, the UK Government has confirmed that it will not pass on the uplift to Scotland and will instead impose deeper cuts to Scotland’s CAP budget – leaving farmers here with the lowest per hectare payments in Europe.



The UK has actually taken this into account and will give the uplift to all the UK farmers, Scotland wanted every penny that was given to the UK which is just ridiciulous. The UK despite the pettiness of Scotland however, has been magnanimous enough to allocate Scotland extra money to avoid the cuts that the whole of the UK faces.


&gt;Rural Affairs Secretary Richard Lochhead said: ""This is a disgraceful budget settlement for Scotland’s farmers and crofters and confirms our worst fears. It condemns Scottish farmers and crofters to the lowest CAP payments in Europe and completely disregards both the cross party demands in the Scottish Parliament and the wishes of the European Union.


This is nothing to do with Farmers, it's wealthy land owners that benefit from this. Again about this implied ""Wishes of the EU"" it's not true.


&gt;“The whole reason the EU brought in the convergence uplift was to benefit those farmers with the lowest per hectare rates, and the only reason the UK qualifies is because of Scotland’s low payments.



The UK qualified, not Scotland, so why should Scotland get all the money. May I remind you that Scotland would get nothing without the UK.



&gt;“The standard method for calculating payment allocations in Europe is the average per hectare amount and any other method invented by UK ministers to deny our farmers a fairer share is nothing more than a red herring.



So, this rewards land owners, not farmers. I wonder how much Donald Trump will get for his land?



&gt;“Contrary to the UK Government’s claims, passing the convergence uplift to Scotland in full cannot be linked to deductions for farming colleagues in England, Wales or Northern Ireland. This is money that rightfully belongs to Scotland and divvying it up across the UK means that farmers in other regions are benefiting at Scotland’s expense. Ironically, the DEFRA Secretary of State argued in Brussels for deeper cuts to the CAP budget but is now saying he needs Scotland’s cash to mitigate cuts elsewhere in the UK – cuts that were much shallower that he demanded.


So the cuts should be shared but the benefits shouldn't? Rubbish.


&gt;“I do not know how UK ministers will be able to look Scottish farmers in the eye after this outrageous decision that amounts to pocketing Scotland’s farm payments. I am aghast that the new Secretary of State for Scotland can welcome the UK Government’s decision to give Scotland the lowest farm payments in the whole of Europe and the UK – he could not have got off to a worst start as far as Scottish agriculture is concerned.



So not only is this supported by the UK, the EU, it's also supported by the Secretary of State for Scotland. So everyone is in favour of it. Oh....  except the Scottish National Party.


&gt;“If Scotland had been a member state in our own right during those negotiations we would have benefited from a €1 billon uplift. We have been denied that uplift and now we are even being denied up to €230 million uplift that the UK gets because of Scotland.

No, they wouldn't, if Scotland had been part of the EU they would have had to pay the fees associated which currently come form the UK.

&gt;“And let’s not forget that in the EU negotiations, 16 out of the 28 countries also negotiated an uplift in their rural development budgets. But the UK Government didn’t lift a finger for Scotland – the country with the lowest share of that fund in Europe as well.

That's because the UK knows the CAP is a trust fund for wealthy land owners and trying to grab money fro your own farmers undercuts your message that it needs reform. The UK is taking the long term logical approach rather than the Scottish view of ""Let's put lots of money into the EU and the funnel it back to our wealthy land owners"".



&gt;“It is clearer than ever before that independence offers the best solution for Scotland and our rural economy - decisions about Scotland’s farming industry should be taken by the people who live and work here rather than have others decide for us.


And here we are, the real reason we're even discussing this.


&gt;“The UK Government’s offer to explore how Scotland could beyond the eight per cent to perhaps 10 per cent coupled support will be small comfort for Scottish farmers after this poor CAP budget settlement.”


Actually according to everyone other than the SNP this is a big win.

Cons: Clubs aren't great (not that I care personally), lack of big cinemas, bowling alleys etc., shops tend to be quite upmarket so it's hard to find cheap clothes, weather isn't as mild as most places, generally fairly expensive (not a problem if you're careful with your money).

I call this medical therapy: ""AMT®"" - which stands for *Advanced Mutilation Technology®.*

It's something I have spent years developing in my laboratory and in the field with randomised control trials. And I fully expect my genius to be recognised by the whole world one day, and for me to receive the Nobel Prize.

It's totally amazing and cost effective, and can cure cancer, HIV/AIDS,STDs, many infections and a host of other diseases and ailments.

Here's how it works (but keep it a secret eh?): I take a very sharp scalpel, and then slash at random parts of the human body, amputating living and healthy flesh and organs.

And then guess what? The remaining parts of the body have less chance of getting cancer, HIV/AIDS, infections etc., because I've just cut a load of flesh away.

I've proved this by slicing away: breasts, ears, noses, clitorises, toes, foreskins, tongues; and many other bits and pieces as the fancy takes me.

And in every single case, the rate of disease has been shown to reduce 100% in all the bit's I've chucked in the hospital bin; thus reducing the overall rates in the remaining flesh.

ROTFL

Surprise surprise! After 3.6 billion years of evolution, the human foreskin is there for a purpose - just like your nose, ears, lips, fingers, anus, eyelids and vagina:

Medical research for you:

http://www.norm-uk.org/circumcision_lost.html

Many people think circumcision removes nothing more than a little extra skin. However, circumcision removes several critical components of male sexual anatomy. This list enumerates everything currently known to be physically lost after circumcision.

Alongside these physical losses, it is important to remember that whenever a child is circumcised, by far the greatest loss is his choice to make decisions about his own body and his own sex life when he becomes an adult. 

Further information on the anatomy of intact male genitals, and a diagram, can be found on the anatomy page.

Circumcision the Hidden Trauma: How an American Cultural Practice Affects Infants and Ultimately Us All

The Foreskin which comprises up to 50% (sometimes more) of the mobile skin system of the penis. If unfolded and spread out flat the average adult foreskin would measure about 15 square inches( the size of a 3x5 inch index card). This highly specialised tissue normally covers the glans and protects it from abrasion, drying, callusing(keratinisation), and contaminants of all kinds.The effect of glans keratinisation has never been studied.

The Foreskin's 'Gliding Action'  - the hallmark mechanical feature of the normal natural, intact penis. This non-abrasive gliding of the penis in and out of itself within the vagina facilitates smooth , comfortable, pleasurable intercourse for both partners. Without this gliding action, the corona of the circumcised penis can function as a oneway valve, scraping vaginal lubricants out into the drying air and making artificial lubricants essential for pleasurable intercourse.

Nerve Endingstransmit Sensation to the Brain
- Fewer Nerve Endings means 
Fewer Sensations Circumcision removes the most important sensory component of the foreskin - thousands of coiled fine-touch receptors called Meissner's corpuscles. Also lost are branches of the dorsal nerve, and between 10,000 and 20,000 specialized erotogenic nerve endings of several types. Together these detect subtle changes in motion and temperature, as well as fine gradations in texture.

Muscle Sheath Circumcision removes approximately half of the temperature-sensitive smooth muscle sheath which lies between the outer layer of skin and the corpus cavernosa. This is called the dartos fascia.

Colouration The natural coloration of the glans and inner foreskin (usually hidden and only visible to others when sexually aroused) is considerably more intense than the permanently exposed and keratinized coloration of a circumcised penis. The socio-biological function of this visual stimulus has never been studied. 
The glans ranges from pink to red to dark purple among intact men of Northern European ancestry, and from pinkish to mahagony to dark brown among intact men of African and Asian descent. If circumcision is performed on an infant or young boy, the connective tissue which protectively fuses the foreskin and glans together is ripped apart. This leaves the glans raw and subject to infection, scarring, pitting, shrinkage, and eventual discoloration. Over a period of years the glans becomes keratinized, adding additional layers of tissue in order to adequately protect itself, which further contributes to discoloration. 
[P. M. Fleiss, MD, MPH, ""The Case Against Circumcision,"" Mothering: The Magazine of Natural Family Living (Winter 1997): 36-45.]

Penis Size Circumcision means 
Less Penis
- Doesn't that matter? Some of the penis length and circumference because its double-layered wrapping of loose and usually overhanging foreskin is now missing, making the circumcised penis truncated and thinner than it would have been if left intact. 
An Australian survey in 1995 showed circumcised men to have erect penises an average of 8mm shorter than intact men. 
[1. R. D. Talarico and J. E. Jasaitis, ""Concealed Penis: A Complication of Neonatal Circumcision,"" Journal of Urology 110 (1973): 732-733. 2. Richters J, Gerofi J, Donovan B. Why do condoms break or slip off in use? An exploratory study. Int J STD AIDS. 1995; 6(1):11-8. ]

Blood Vessels Several feet of blood vessels, including the frenular artery and branches of the dorsal artery are removed in circumcision. This loss of the rich vascularity interrupts normal flow to the shaft and glans of the penis, damaging the the natural function of the penis and altering its development. [1. H. C. Bazett et al., ""Depth, Distribution and Probable Identification in the Prepuce of Sensory End-Organs Concerned in Sensations of Temperature and Touch; Thermometric Conductivity,"" Archives of Neurology and Psychiatry 27 (1932): 489-517.� 2. Netter, F.H., ""Atlas of Human Anatomy,"" Second Edition (Novartis, 1997): plates 238, 239.]

Dorsal Nerves The terminal branch of the pudendal nerve connects to the skin of the penis, the prepuce, the corpora cavernosa, and the glans. Destruction of these nerves is a rare but devastating complication of circumcision. If cut during circumcision, the top two-thirds of the penis will be almost completely without sensation. [1.

Complications Every year boys lose their entire penises from circumcision accidents and infection. They are then ""sexually reassigned"" by castration and ""transgender surgery"" and expected to live their lives as ""females"". [1. J. P. Gearhart and J. A.

Sigmundson, ""Sex Reassignment at Birth: Long-Term Review and Clinical Implications,"" Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine 151 (1997): 298-304.]

Death Every year many boys lose their lives from the complications of circumcision, a fact the billion-dollar-a-year circumcision industry in the U.S. routinely obscures and ignores.

Emotional Bonding Circumcision performed during infancy disrupts the bonding process between child and mother. There are indications that the innate sense of trust in intimate human contact is inhibited or lost. It can also have significant adverse effects on neurological development. Additionally, an infant's self-confidence and hardiness is diminished by forcing the newborn victim into a defensive psychological state of ""learned helplessness"" or ""acquired passivity"" to cope with the excruciating pain which he can neither fight nor flee. The trauma of this early pain lowers a circumcised boy's pain threshold below that of intact boys and girls. [1. R. Goldman, Circumcision: The Hidden Trauma (Boston: Vanguard Publications, 1997), 139-175. 2. A. Taddio et al., ""Effect of Neonatal Circumcision on Pain Responses during Vaccination in Boys,"" Lancet 345 (1995): 291-292.]

Neurological Sexual Communication Although never studied scientifically, contemporary evidence suggests that a penis without its foreskin lacks the capacity for the subtle neurological ""cross-communication"" that occurs only during contact between mucous membranes and which contributes to the experience of sexual pleasure. Amputating an infant boy's multi-functional foreskin is a ""low-grade neurological castration"" [Immerman], which diminishes the intensity of the entire sexual experience for both the circumcised male and his partner.)",0,1384006078,null,0,false,0,cdaca9v,t3_1q7njy,t1_cdaca9v,t1_cdaca7a,null,1428728902,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

""One life I tried to forget"" and this is clearly a Time War special seals Hurt being pre-Nine and post-Eight unless Moffat wants to risk diminishing the effect of Nine's roll as the Shell Shocked Doctor.  


If Nine was around (or Eight, but I'll use ""Nine"" for brevity however either of these two are interchangeable) we could argue Hurt is a future Doctor still.  Nine could be shell shocked as he would be seeing the end of the Time War for the first time done by a future self.  It'd be shocking, it'd shake him to his core that he would one day be capable of it.  He's a time traveler so despite not being the one who directly ended the war he knows the problem with changing your own time stream.  He didn't, but will.  It's still him.  He's the one who will kill the Time Lords and even if he didn't push the button he helped make it possible by being there.


But Nine isn't there.  Unless Moffat sneaks in Eight or Nine as a witness through rotoscoping or filler actors similar to George McFly in Back to the Future 2 and 3 that is.  It can't be simply Nine was fighting and heard he did the deed.  ""


This makes Ten the ""youngest"" confirmed viewer of the event, but he's the Survivor Guilt Doctor.  Then you have Denial (acting childish to try to deny his darker side)/Middle Aged Doctor.  Unlike Nine, how Tennant and Smith portrayed their Doctor doesn't work time wise if they were the first to see the Time War ending.  Nine could just see it before he met Rose.  Ten and Eleven were definitely already there first hand.


The only unaccounted for Doctor entirely is the Hurt Doctor.  This trailer kills the hypothesis that Hurt could be a future regeneration the Doctor is aware of and fearing his regeneration into this.  Hurt has to be pre-Nine.


Hypothetically, Hurt could still be an Eight that aged heavily.  This is why I said ""almost certainly"".  Though I personally find this unlikely since Clara stated she didn't recognize ""that Doctor"" in Name of the Doctor instead of saying something like ""You look so old"".  At that point she is the second most familiar person in the universe with the differences between the Doctor's regenerations.  Add to it Moffat teasing we miscounted the regenerations and in ~~""Smith and Jones""~~ ""School Reunion"" the Doctor (either accidentally or on purpose) implies he's on his 11th body[1] (small details like this Moffat eats up) pushes the weight towards 8.5 regeneration.

SJS: ""You've regenerated""


Ten: ""A half-dozen times since we last met"" using specific instead of ""around"".

Watch this great video. Totally professional and insightful. Amazing. So much great knowledge:

http://youtu.be/DD2yW7AaZFw

Ken McGrath, Senior Lecturer in Pathology at the Faculty of Health, Auckland University of Technology and Member of the New Zealand Institute of Medical Laboratory Scientists discusses his research into the neural anatomy of the human penis and the physical damages caused by circumcision.

McGrath is author of The Frenular Delta: A New Preputial Structure published in Understanding Circumcision: A Multi-Disciplinary Approach to a Multi-Dimensional Problem, Proceedings of the Sixth International Symposium on Genital Integrity: Safeguarding Fundamental Human Rights in the 21st Century, held December 7-9, 2000, in Sydney Australia.

Abstract: Textbooks and papers referring to penile function state that the source of penile sensation is solely the glans and often justify the existence of the prepuce by stating it protects the 'sensitive' glans. These statements are contrary to the neuro-anatomical and physiological facts accumulated over more than a century. This study reviews the findings of Taylor, et al., that the prepuce is the primary sensory platform of the penis, and describes a new preputial structure.

This interview was taped in Berkeley, California 2010.

...and from the Global Survey of Circumcision Harm

http://www.circumcisionharm.org/

Removal of the male foreskin and the female clitoral hood (female foreskin) are anatomically equivalent. 

However, neurologically speaking, removal of the male foreskin is as destructive to male sexual sensory experience as removal of the clitoris is for females. This video discussion of penile and foreskin neurology explains why. 

Contrary to popular Western myth, many circumcised women do report the ability to feel sexual pleasure and to have orgasm, albeit in a compensatory manner that differs from intact women [suggested reading: Prisoners of Ritual by Hanny Lightfoot-Klein]. Similar compensatory behaviours for achieving orgasm are at work among circumcised men, who must rely on the remaining 50% or less of their penile nerve endings. 

Just as clitoridectomized girls grow up not knowing the levels of pleasure they could have experienced had they been left intact, so too are men circumcised in infancy unaware of the pleasure they could have experienced had they not had 50% of their penile skin removed. The above video also explains what's really behind the erroneous comment made by some circumcised men that they 'couldn't stand being any more sensitive'..

Here's how the penis and the clitoris both develop separately from the genital tuber:

http://www.baby2see.com/gender/external_genitals.html

The male foreskin and female clitoral hood are anatomically equivalent, but ""equivalent"" is an everyday way of explaining it. The proper term is ""homology"".

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)

*""In the context of sexual differentiation—the process of development of the differences between males and females from an undifferentiated fertilized egg—the male and female organs are homologous if they develop from the same embryonic tissue. A typical example is the ovaries of female humans and the testicles of male humans""*

So the clitoris and penis may be said to be ""homologous""; and the same can be said of the foreskin and clitoral hood. But that does not mean they have the same function or scale. For instance, the male foreskin in a adult is around 13 to 15 square inches in size; whilst the female clitoral hood is much, much smaller.

Also, please do remember that the clitoris is a very large organ, most of which is *internal* to the female.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clitoris

The visible part - the glans clitoris - is only a small part of the whole clitoris. So when a woman suffers partial or total amputation of the external clitoris when undergoing the crime of FGM, only a small part of her clitoris is removed.

You can read a comprehensive analysis of the sensitivity of the foreskin here. This relies on research in the British Journal of Urology:

http://www.moralogous.com/page/2/

Foreskin Sexual Function/Circumcision Sexual Dysfunction

http://www.cirp.org/library/sex_function/

British Journal of Urology:

Fine-touch pressure thresholds in the adult penis

http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2006.06685.x/full

Male circumcision decreases penile sensitivity as measured in a large cohort

http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2013.11794.x/abstract

**Conclusion:** What is the most sensitive part of the external genitalia of the male?: The foreskin with it's 22,000 nerve endings. What is the most sensitive part of the external genitalia of the female? The glans clitoris, with it's 8,000 nerve endings. 

Hence Ken McGrath's conclusion: *""neurologically speaking, removal of the male foreskin is as destructive to male sexual sensory experience as removal of the clitoris is for females.""*

In order to understand this subject fully, you need a complete and comprehensive dissemination of the structure, function and  anatomy of the male and female genitalia and the associated medical and scientific research in these matters.

The new personality also alters the way they think about things. Looking back at 1 he was a brilliant engineer who could fix anything in a hurry without any type of problem this was because his personality was calm and logical allowing for almost no emotions, then came 2 who was a worry wort and practically ruled by emotion. 2 was in an instance where he simply needed to activate the thrusters on one side of a space craft to get them back to the Tardis, however oxygen was low and he was worried for his companions, this distracted him so much that he ignited the wrong thrusters and sent them too far off course to get back to the Tardis and would have resulted in their deaths if someone hadn't come by on a chance. This wouldn't have been a problem for 1.

 Also jump ahead to 6 who was unlike any of the other doctors by being rude and self absorbed. This was simply part of his personality.

Pros - IBMS accredited course and the inner-city campus is quite literally a few meters from a pub. Whilst working on my dissertation I could set an experiment running in the morning and go over the way for a nice cooked breakfast whilst typing up the previous day's data. The Library is expansive at both campuses and the wifi is pretty solid. It's also in Sheffield, which in my honest opinion is one of the best cities in England. The University of Sheffield is nearby, and there is always some good natured banter between the students and varsity is always a fantastic competition with a great deal of skill on both sides. Public transport links are good, with Sheffield train station being approximately 200m from city campus and most of the student halls of residence.

Cons - If you're looking to do an anatomy based Biosciences course, don't bother with SHU. The BMS course at Hallam is better for analytical sciences (which is exactly why I went there to begin with). Whilst everything is very well linked in Sheffield, the busses can be very erratic at times. The student union also seems to only play one kind of music. Support for societies that aren't sport-based is minimal at best.

They would want a source of revenue equal to or greater than that figure.  They aren't going to get it from pedestrians, trams and such. 

You'd also have to look at where and why there is congestion.  Not all of it may be people trying to get in to the city for work, a fair chunk is going to be people leaving the area for the exact same reason; nailing either to a wall is probably not going to be useful or productive. 

It's actually a far more complex and interwoven problem than people consider, as Bristol on its own is not sufficient.  It'd be wholly unsuitable for commuters coming any real distance because whilst the bus/trams/trains all working near the city... they don't outside the city and it's all cars.

I said that going on what I know now, my boss mike marsh sits in all the meetings, he then fills his team in (which includes me) and I then relay what I can to you guys (within reason)

anybody that has ever worked in any job ever will know the managements plan could change (and usually does) as the windows approaches, its usually because players interest becomes hot or cold depending on where you are in the table at the time of asking, right now were doing extremely well and we have some pulling power. 

at the moment were second/third doing very well but the January prediction is 4/5th, now the question for the management is do we:

a) spend money now while we're hot, make for a push and not get all the players we want because they don't want to move about mid season/don't want to commit yet and come summer have less money to spend

b) use our transfer budget plus additional available funds and use our final league position to target all the players we want but there is no guarantee they'll want to come depending on where we finish  

(could go into a lot more detail on them questions but in a rush) we have very good depth at the club at the moment but to be a big fish now we need to bring big players in that go straight into the first team and they one, wont come cheap and two, wont come to teams that are not in the CL. So come january if we are 4th the management may look at this may reevaluate where they think we'll finish and may decide that we need to spend in order to finish in the top 4 or they think we can do it with what we have play out the season and hopefully finish top 4 then bring them in.

The nationalist parties are moving left, but I'm not that knowledgeable on their policies so I don't know how exactly to label them, I may be way off the mark.

The two biggest parties in Northern Ireland are SF and DUP. UUP used to have a thing going back in the day but are pretty much dying on their arse. DUP is undoubtedly the most right wing party.

NI21 are the new kids on the block (created by two former UUP members because tribal politics/policies with the two main unionist parties was getting out of hand) and haven't announced their policies as of yet (their first conference is next week I think) but everyone and their mums fully expects them to be left leaning.

Just on this point, the Paras actually performed far more magnanimously  that their reputation in these situations would suggest.

The Paras in fact *did* accept Junta surrenders, but what would happen is the paras (when they were walking over to the prisoners) would be gunned down by other Junta hiding in the bushes near by.

This lead to Junta surrenders rarely being accepted.

Pros:

* **Fantastic city** (I saw a news article saying it's the best for young people in the UK a few weeks back), and the city centre is a 5 minute walk from the main campus.
* Good Union

* Cheap houses once your out of Halls. I currently pay £260 for a decent sized 4 bed house within 10 mins of the city centre.

**Cons**

* The halls of residence are varied. Best ones are Talybont Court &amp; South and Gordon Hall. Worst ones are Talybont North and  (unless you like walking) Uni Halls.

* Some areas of the city (mostly where the students live) are a bit run down and messy. But I guess this is true of most cities.

After the West Ham game, it was as if we were headed for relegation, whereas previously it felt like we were in the title hunt.

Furthermore, I think many fans have very high hopes for our new players and rightfully so.  Soldado and Lamela (who both haven't played at their best yet in my opinion) are given the benefit of the doubt over players like Defoe and Townsend.

true,DirectAddress,,Formerly Coleraine,"The main 5 parties are: Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), Alliance Party, Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and Sinn Fein. 


In the NI Assembly there is also NI21, Green Party and Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) as well as independents.
 

The current political system is the D'Hondt system. D'Hondt effectively means that for anything for pass the assembly, it has to receive a majority of BOTH the Unionists and Nationalists. D'Hondt is also used to distribute ministries fairly amongst the house. 


When it comes to the political spectrum, it's very difficult to rate the parties. In general I think it's safe to say that all of the major parties are or have conservative elements in them. The most liberal of the parties, as said above, would be Alliance and Greens, however even they have strong conservative elements. The best way to rate them on the spectrum would be to look at which parties they're associated with:

* DUP - not really linked to anyone, easily the most conservative though

* UUP - Links to the British Conservative Party, stood as joint party at the 2010 General Election. Conservatives have since started their own NI party (NI Conservatives really don't matter) 
* Alliance - Sister of the British Liberal Democrat Party 
* SDLP - Links to both the British and Irish Labour Parties
* SF - no links. They stand as SF in the Republic of Ireland also. Historical links to both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil who split from Sinn Fein in the 1920's


It's easiest to put the parties on the Unionist National scale: 

Unionist

* DUP
* UUP 
* Alliance
* SDLP
* Sinn Fein

Nationalist

Hope that helps!

Taiwan hasn't been a part of the mainland since the Qing dynasty, and even then it wasn't a very solidified part of 'China'.  It was pretty much controlled by the Dutch, Portuguese and various Aboriginal Kingdoms before Zheng Cheng-gong, who established his own short-lived 'kingdom' for a few decades before eventually giving in to the Qing.

When the KMT took over and established the ROC on Taiwan the people here didn't even speak Mandarin.  It was beaten into them (literally, you were slapped for speaking anything else) at school.  A lot of the older generation of Taiwanese are nostalgic for the Japanese because they were *better in comparison*.  That tells you something.

It's a real and emotive issue for an entire generation of CHINESE people, much like the Falklands is not changing at all and hasn't been a part of Argentina but is a real and emotive issue for an entire generation of ARGENTINIANS.  

Oddly enough, most Taiwanese people don't really care, much like most British people don't really care.  I suppose we care a bit more about our status in Taiwan because we're looking at Hong Kong and thinking ""no thanks"" but in general we don't think anything's going to change any time soon and we're more worried about what to get from the tea shop next.

This sums it up for me, why are we concerned when the guy's had 1 PL start?

Defoe has had chances to prove himself in the PL and it's pretty obvious he cannot perform at the highest level against top opponents.

It's also a case of comparing apples and oranges. Everyone's excited because Lamela is starting to find confidence, not because we think he's now our best player or one of. Defoe scoring in the EL and continually not scoring in the PL (not just this season) only reinforces the idea that he is not good enough.

Willian, Hazard and Oscar do not even know what the touchline near the corner flag looks like. As soon as they tea h the edge/corner of the box, they will cut back and try to dribble to the centre in hopes of scoring a beautiful curler from the edge/outside of the box. Unnecessary and selfish. It's is like having three Sturridges in the team. (Yeah, I'm pissed) 

That's why I like to have Mata on the pitch.

If this is such an issue for you, please feel free to move to one of the countries which isn't part of the UN. The US has not demanded that the right to bear arms be part of the any UN charter on human rights.

And of course it's relevant. Either we have the UN and abide by it for the betterment of the human race, or we go back to empires, alliances and the bullshit that led to two world wars.

&gt;Americans think guns are a fundamental human right

Which part of my previous post, where I literally quoted the second amendment to you, has confused you? Firstly, (and I'm now repeating myself) it doesn't say 'fundamental' anywhere. You are adding this word as if to add weight to make it a crucial right to live. Secondly, again, it only refers to people living or under the jurisdiction of the USA. It is not a right granted to all humans by the single biggest authority over the planet.

You clearly can't grasp the clear differences between making a decision about whether to own a gun, and how you are born. Nobody chooses to be gay, they are simply born that way. Therefore punishing someone simply for this is unfair and unjust. **Owning a gun is a choice, you do not have to do it, you do not need it. The** One of these two issues is a lifestyle choice, the other is not.

Guess what, the legal age for consent in Spain was at one point 13. Do you think that meant it would have been fine for people in the UK who wanted sex with 13 year olds to claim asylum in Spain?

&gt;What I'm saying is why does the UK have to take people in because of their countries shitty laws? 

The UK doesn't have to, they are free to choose whatever country they like. But our forefathers as you so previously brought up created a welcoming tolerant society, and signed up the UN mandates that lets people claim asylum when their human rights are being breached.

We have looked vulnerable at times, and the best thing Mou brought with him this season to the Bridge is ""Luck"", which we haven't had so much in the past and which is the reason we are merely hanging at the top.

With all the big names in the midfield, its still lacking quality. Here is what I believe Mourinho has to solve ASAP.

1). Find ways to get the ball in Lampard and Ramires's feet outside the D-box, because they can give you 20 goals a season, combined.

2). Change the formation. 4231 is no longer suitable. Find a way to get Mata on the pitch, thats where your best players belong.

3). Rotate Cesar Azpilicueta in the squad more with Cole, he looks the part: physical, tough and technically sound.

I was watching the first Harry Potter movie recently with a tween pal of mine who is also a Who fan who has not been able to see the most recent season/s (7a/7b) but who knows at least a little bit about what's going on.  When we get to the scene where Harry picks out a want, my young friend says of Olivander, ""He reminds me of one of the Doctor's!""  And I said something about him indeed looking a lot like the first Doctor.  And she asks me who the actor is who plays Olivander.  And I casually say that it's John Hurt.  It takes both of us a single, silent beat to be shocked that it really is a Doctor!

I think that's a testament to the quality of Hurt's acting ability, as well, perhaps, as the quality if the make-up and wardrobe departments, that I didn't even think that Olivander was the same actor as HurtDoctor, even though I did, in fact, know that they were both John Hurt.

It's been argued (mainly by political historians) that their policy of high spending, high borrowing, and low taxation was a direct consequence of the focus-group strategy. 

I'm not really blaming them - after 1992 they were desperate to rebuild their electoral support. But it does show how the scramble for popularity can often prove to be a weakness rather than a strength of democratic systems.

Defoe has been around forever. We've suffered through watching him be our first choice striker in more games than I care to remember. He's 31(?) years old and we know exactly what he brings to the table.

Lamella on the other hand is a complete unknown. He clearly has talent, but no one knows just how high his ceiling is. He could genuinely be anywhere on the spectrum from enormous bust to budding superstar. This, coupled with the fact that we splashed out so much money for him, is causing a lot of people angst as we wait to see what happens with him. I think many people (myself included) expected him to immediately come in and have the impact that you would typically expect from a £30 million player. I think this was an unreasonable expectation, but the fact that he hasn't has made a lot of people very nervous.

I think citizens of each country should vote for government who do what is best for themselves. But I don't want to debate about what the UN says or thinks. I want to debate about what is actually RIGHT based on my own opinions about individual freedom and rights. My original post is essentially just making a point that some countries award different rights to others. Just because a body like the UN says some rights are essential and others aren't doesn't make that automatically 100% correct. See what I mean?

As for owning a gun vs being gay. You are confusing my point and mis-stating my argument, either deliberately or accidentally. OWNING the gun is a choice. But I am specifically talking about being ABLE to own it if you choose to (i.e. the ""right"" to do so). There's a huge difference there. You keep saying this ""you can't choose to be gay"" as if I am disagreeing with that somehow - but I'm not.

In the UK, possessing a gun gets you an instant 5 years in jail. In another country, it doesn't. Maybe in another country, getting caught shagging another guy gets you 5 years in jail, but in the UK we say it's fine. And the UN have their opinions too. But as far as I can see it, owning a gun, banging guys, having sex before marriage and many other things should be considered essential individual rights as long as they don't directly restrict the rights or freedoms of other people. So either of those laws are curtailing my individual freedom in a certain way, whether they are based on public safety or religion or whatever. 

As I tried to say in my original post, I disagree with the idea that people should be able to claim asylum simply based on shitty laws in their home countries. And trust me, to a hardcore American gun nut (which I am not btw), the idea of NOT being able to bear arms and facing prison for having a gun would be just as terrifying as fear of imprisonment for homosexuality. Maybe they would want to claim asylum in another country with loose gun laws if Obama appealed the 2nd amendment! And would they really be wrong to?

The show’s not about a spin doctor. It’s about an MP. I have to admit when we first started, I slightly felt like we were behind the zeitgeist, in terms of spin doctors weren’t really that. I think we use the wrong terminology for them, really, whatever they are: advisors or something. And of course Malcolm, yes, he’s a press advisor, but he has power, or had power—almost the powers of chief of staff, without that being official. **Almost like being a Rahm Emanuel, but without anyone admitting it.**

He may not be BASED on him, but even Peter Capaldi had noted the similarity.

I really really dig that Capaldi took the spot.  After watching him in In The Loop, I think he's a fantastic choice.

true,lordweiner27,null,null,"So the situation right now is that it's mostly free parking and they want to change it to residents only is that right?

My understanding is that free parking is often a bad idea in high demand areas because people will use it to park all day like you said and take up a space that could be used more productively.  It can also increase congestion because people spend more time cruising around looking for a space (because when things are free people tend to overuse them.)  

Economically for a town high street, (and for you personally running your pub) as well as residents parking what you want is metered parking.  This way people can pull right into a space (the spaces won't be too clogged because it would be expensive to park their all day) pay for two hours, (a couple of quid is not much to most people if they're taking their family out for lunch) have their pub lunch and leave.

true,Robotochan,cnty-england,Ashby-de-la-Zouch,"&gt;There's a huge difference there. You keep saying this ""you can't choose to be gay"" as if I am disagreeing with that somehow - but I'm not

So why the fuck are you comparing these issues? Guns are a choice, homosexuality is not!

&gt;But as far as I can see it, owning a gun, banging guys, having sex before marriage and many other things should be considered essential individual rights

What about age of consent? It's an individual choice, but would you think it's best if we did away with it.

&gt;I disagree with the idea that people should be able to claim asylum based on shitty laws in their home countries

That's not what is happening. It's based on persecution. And I assume that means you don't think anyone should be able to claim asylum. When the Tutsi were being raped, being infected with AIDS, and of course massacred simply for being Tutsi, if one of them got to the UK, would you stick them back on plane and drop them back off? They couldn't help being Tutsi, just as these people can't help being gay.

&gt;And trust me, to a hardcore American gun nut (which I am not btw), the idea of NOT being able to bear arms and facing prison for having a gun would be just as terrifying as fear of imprisonment for homosexuality. 

Are you fucking serious? The threat of having to hand over your guns is just as bad as the threat of being violently attacked, imprisoned etc just for being yourself. I'm sure some people would feel oppressed, but look at it objectively and these two instances cannot even be slightly related. 

&gt;And would they really be wrong to? It's the exact same principle as homosexuals in Africa, and the only difference is the UN viewpoint on the matter.

It is not the same principle in the slightest. You ban guns and what does the gun nut have to do, give up his guns. You ban homosexuality, what is the gay person meant to do?

We need a deeper midfielder who can play QUICK, incisive passes for 90 minutes and I think Oscar can be that man. My only concern is if he can handle the defensive side of the position.

I also think our best team has Mata at the 10 spot. Oscar is good there, no doubt, but right now he doesn't create chances like Mata does. Furthermore, and I think this is key, Mata and Hazard have the best link up play in the team. It's a unique connection that is fantastic to watch, and will only get better with game time together.  

With Oscar deep, Mata as the number 10, and Hazard on the wing, that leaves Schurle and Willian to take the right wing spot, where I think we'd want them to provide some real width. 

Obviously Mourinho knows better than me, and I know he's doing what is best for the team in the long run. I just don't like watching our team play so stifled in attack for long periods of the game. Often times we don't look like scoring a goal (at least without luck) until we're losing or going for the win late in the game, and I don't think that is what most of the fans expect with all of our attacking talent. Of course, it's still early and we're still trying to gel, but there's a good chance we'll be out of the top four by the end of the weekend, so we really need to start clicking.

Infinity (FTTC broadband) has technical advantages over satellite and providing TV over FTTC doesn't require much additional infrastructure. Sky have huge margins and they have leveraged their monopoly to depress the carriage fees paid to non-Sky channels, which allows BT to offer all the non-Sky channels extremely cheaply.

It seems like a good bet, but will take a while to pay off. The pay TV sector is growing, so they just need a large chunk of new pay TV subscribers rather than Sky switchers, and it's not a hugely difficult sell to get BT broadband subscribers to pay £5/mo for 18 extra channels.

Sky's response is to invest in exclusive scripted content, both original and imported, that isn't available to BT. Sky is notoriously crap at creating original content, though, and I can see buying import exclusivity becoming increasingly expensive.

Martinez has liked him as far wide as possible but he's not attacking the penalty box even as well as Coleman from that position.  All his best work was cutting in or floating into the center.  Is he a winger or not?

Baines was bizarre today.  He did great things but none of this final decisions or set-pieces worked.  Pienaar was the star for me.  And jesus, where would be without Barry and McCarthy?

All-in-all we're still competing.  And we looked stubborn enough to *maybe* see out some of these hard fixtures coming up.  After GW 15 we'll have a real sense here.

As for Hugh Laurie doing any recent British tv, up until May of 2012, he was doing *House*.  I doubt he's interested in immediately getting back into television after the long years there.  Right now, he's probably taking a nice break, doing some theatre, etc.

Things he's done that people in the wider world may have seen or heard: for tv, he's done some interviews (*The One Show*, etc).  But most of the stuff I've heard of recently has been radio (ie, *Hugh Laurie's Blues Changes*).  I rather liked his episode of *Desert Island Discs*.

not-quite-an-edit: I was going to post this and went off to check something.  He did a couple episodes of *Perspectives* this summer; the episode description says ""After giving up the daily grind of making a hugely popular American television show (House), Hugh Laurie now devotes a big part of his life to his beloved blues.

Cech


Azpi Luiz JT Bertrand


Ramires Essien/Mikel


Willian Mata Hazard


Torres/Eto'o


Azpi at right back because he offers much more in the attack, and he can definitely get the job done defensively against mid-low level teams. Terry because he is one of our most consistently good CBs no matter who we play. Luiz for a similar reason to Azpi, but only if Jose can sort out his nonchalant attitude when he's up against lower opposition. I think if he can take care of his careless attitude and work on transitioning the ball to the midfield without just booting up field to no man's land he could have really helped us out against West Brom. Bertrand also is very good going forward, and from the few games he's had this season he's looked like he's been tracking back well. I'm not a big fan of switching up the back line too much but with Jose's discipline I think this back four could work.


The two center midfield positions were harder. Ramires is always giving other teams trouble with his pace and constant runs. Essien would be able to cover for Luiz/Azpi/Bertrand pushing forward, and he also makes those strong runs forward a few times a game when he looks like he just can't be stopped. Mikel could also be switched with Essien.


Mata is the most important player we need when we're playing teams who park the bus. He is just so much more calm and good with the ball at splitting open a defense. Willian and Hazard on the wings will constantly trouble defenses and also track back and help our back line. 


Either of Torres and Eto'o up top would work. At the moment since Torres is injured, Eto'o is obviously first choice, but both of them have been working hard lately and deserve the start. Maybe Ba if it's a more physical side.

Any other group of hackers doing the same thing if caught would face serious prison time.

We don't accept terrorist organisations spying on innocent hard working British families anymore than the yanks do, it's just that we're a bit powerless to do much about it.  Just like the yanks.

There is the other problem that the average person doesn't have a clue about it all, they can only just log into Gmail using their 4 digit password, or understand that the internet isn't actually on their laptop etc.

Paedophilia, in any society is, as I explained before non-consensual and exploitative by its nature in a way that adult sex is not. This is because children are physically and mentally ill equipped to deal with sexual behaviour.

Jose is a pragmatic manager so I'm not surprised he would opt for 2 ""natural"" central midfielders and a hardworking number 10 in Oscar.

I really do hope that Oscar in a deeper role is experimented at least. We've been lacking a central midfielder who can link up play from defense to attack and also work hard off the ball, someone like Xabi Alonso or Modric or Gundogan- a proper regista to help us control the flow of the game. Though there is the risk of being light in midfield, which is why it's very important to find the best partner for Oscar if he does shift to CM.

I too think that Mata is our best #10. His calmness in possession and ability to pick out the right pass to unlock the opposition defense is unrivaled in our squad. This is after all the man that got 20 goals and 30 assists last season. He does need some work off the ball and it looks like Jose is working on that.

Stafford as a town during the day isn't that bad, the high street is quite nice and the locals are pretty decent. At night however, it seems all the assholes come out the cracks and gather around all the only BARELY nice clubs/pubs. 

The students on the campus were a huge divide. There were the film/music people, the engineering people and the gaming/computing people. The engineering people were alright (bar one absolute asshole who I had the complete displeasure of knowing). The gaming/computing crowd mostly kept to themselves but those who didn't were pretty friendly and seemed to be the ones making the most out of the uni's social side. That was pretty cool to see. Then there were the film people... 

I've kept in touch with only a few people since graduating. It was ridiculously cliquey. I cant speak for those I didn't get to know better (and I'm certain not all of them were like this) but they were some of the most narcissistic, judgemental and bitchy people I've ever come across, and it's completely turned me off using my degree for anything other than CV padding. They were unbelievably judgemental about the more 'nerdy' students. The lecturers only gave a damn about the students who had their noses so far up their asses they could sniff their breath. 

The university felt like it tried too hard, and just flopped. I accept that there are many, many people who will have gone there and loved it- leaving with some great postgrad opportunities but... I hated it. The m/f ratio never bothered me as I had my partner back at home but if something like that would bother you- all the more reason not to go there.

To clarify, the D'Hondt system isn't used when deciding who gets elected as an MLA.  ie: It isn't used in the legislative branch.  It's used after MLAs have been elected.

The D'Hondt system is used to distribute ministerial posts within the Government (the Executive).  What this means is that multiple parties will go into government.  This results in an incredibly weak Opposition to Government in the legislative branch.  It's also the reason why Sinn Féin and the DUP, who don't agree on anything really, are in Government together (along with the SDLP, Alliance and UUP).  

It's the Good Friday Agreement which stipulates that for anything to pass, it must have a cross community mandate from Nationalists and Unionists.  The wording is (purposefully) vague, as to allow wiggle room for growth.  However, very recently, Sinn Féin and the DUP have realised between them they hold the majority in the legislature and can tick the ""cross community"" box without the interference of the SDLP, UUP and Alliance.

UUP leader Mike Nesbitt cried foul but, well, it's a shitty system and his party, the SDLP and Alliance should really be in opposition.  What happens instead of open and transparent debate is that everyone in government (read as: *everyone*) goes behind closed doors and bargains one and other to get their legislation passed.  This results in policies being selected on strength behind closed doors rather than strength of debate, or, you know, how good a policy actually is.

I rambled on there but it's a pet hate of mine that we have a ""everyone's a winner"" when it comes to executive selection.  It results in BS.

**tl;dr**: D'Hondt is a mathematical selection process that creates power sharing.  The Good Friday Agreement is what stipulates Unionist / Nationalist co-operation.

assuming the jewel is the moment, hurt has to be an old 8th. he has 8s new and old clothes on, and the new clothes count as 9s jacket. if its not the moment, it could be anything. dont forget the moment was created from a modified de-mat gun, which doesnt really resemble the jewel thing at all. but i think its also safe to assume since gallifrey, and daleks, and everything else, this is the time war, so its more than likely that hurt is the one who ended the war.

however, 10 could still be the meta, although there is conflicting information. his tardis appears, he has a screwdriver, etc. whos to say his ""grown"" tardis would be exactly the same? the main issue i have with him being the real 10 tho, is that if it was real 10, he would have already known(as 11) where all this was going since before regenerating to 11.

clara never saw hurt, which could be residual memory wipe from the moment. but, this could also be my first bit that would support hurt being the meta, but still, if hurt was the meta, he wouldnt be in the doctors time line in this universe.

the vortex manipulator doesnt give any proof of who is from what universe or anything. it could be rivers. 

but alot of this could be turned over, because there are sometimes hundreds of years between the Doctors timeline and the companions, as in the impossible astronaut. 

also, the theories that 11 is actually the ""new 4th"" are debunked because he tells Craig that he is the 11th.

What it sounds like to me, and this is an assumption, is *no* because when you lived in the states you lived with your mother and he lived elsewhere with his own lease - is this correct? If so, this is going to seriously dampen your chances. The UKBA requires proof of consistent cohabitation in a 2+ year period. Can you prove you lived together for a minimum period of two years? Without this, you are not in a good place. At all. 

Be advised, as well, you cannot convert your status while in the UK. This visa must be applied for before departure and can take up to six months to be processed. 

Now, if you have the two years what you need to do is provide evidence as to your relationship and why you were not living together. I would compile emails and phone logs (from both his account and your account) between you both, highlighted and paper-clipped together with a letter explaining why you were apart for 10 months. The Home Office is basically staffed by shits, but they're not total idiots: they will understand you could not join him while he was here due to your nationality, so proving you remained in a relationship will be clutch.

The HO also loves photos, but they don't really care too much about them because, hey, photos can be staged. What cannot be staged, and things critical to case acceptance are:
* Leases with both your names on it
* Evidence of travel together and to see each other
* Phone records (print them out from whoever you use and highlight his number, do the same on his end with your number)
* Mail sent to the both of you at an address
* Evidence of joint bank accounts

Leases and bank accounts are the two most important things. The UK is not in the business of allowing casual partners into the country. The whole unmarried partner thing is based on the idea you are in a relationship akin to marriage.

Can you tell me what documents you have?

The cost for application is £851, in advance, and your partner must be earning £18,600 to sponsor you. Can you confirm he is making that much?

What you have there looks to simply be a real coin that somehow incredibly worn.  It might have been dropped on a beach or in a river which has lead to some weathering on it and then found a few years later.  It should be noted the 1996 issue coin on the right has the old portrait of the queen on it which is why it doesn't match up with the year 2000 issue worn left coin.  The queens portrait was updated for all British coins in 1998 so the very worn 2000 issue coin would look a lot more like [this one](http://www.coins-of-the-uk.co.uk/pics/dec/20/20_01.jpg) without any weathering.

There is none of this hate towards Joe Cole/ Glen Johnson/ Tricky Trev Sinclair who also left after we went down, because they did it in a civilised way.

Lampard was hated while still at West Ham because of an image of nepotism. He's hated even more now because of how he used the media to slag us off after he left. 

Not every player who leaves is automatically hated, Rio for example, is remembered fondly. As is Carrick, Dave James, Scott Parker etc. Although admittedly this may be  partly because of their performances for the club, it shows there are reasons behind the grudges of some ex players. It's not an automatic hatred simply for leaving.

Pros: 

Wonderful, picturesque city. Campus ten minutes' walk from the city proper. Wonderful greenery on campus, and the decaying concrete buildings have a charm of their own that you start to appreciate after a few weeks here. More excellent pubs than you'll manage to get through in a lifetime. Lots of lovely places to live once you're out of halls. Relatively safe city. Has a well-deserved reputation for being a bit geeky- it's not somewhere to come if you want a constant party lifestyle, although the nightlife's still pretty decent. 

*So many societies*. Incredibly vibrant campus life, outstanding campus media (Newspapers, magazines, satirical rags, radio station). 

Excellent student support. 

Lots of ducks. 

Cons:

PPE students. Oxbridge reject syndrome, everywhere. 
One of the worst Students' Unions in the country- underfunded, corrupt, lacking facilities (no actual ""Union building"", for starters), and a comical lack of engagement with the student body. Students mostly ignore its existence unless they need to turn to someone who isn't an elected officer- mercifully, they're a bit more competent at their jobs. 
The older parts of campus are a bit run-down. 
York has a mediocre clubbing scene. 
If you're after the big city lifestyle, you might find yourself bored after a year or two. 

Lots of geese. 

Also, the Economics department is an absolute tragedy at undergrad level. *Awful* teaching, a complete void of support for students, and some genuinely atrocious lecturers. Really couldn't give a fuck about the students, at all. 

…Fortunately, they're very outside the norm for York. Most of the other departments are outstanding.

It's entirely another - and not one that any vaguely hard science can hope to answer - to speculate as to what would happen if such a drug were legalised.

There's also the point that the main reason alcohol and tobacco are legal is because there's too much backlash to cracking down on them (and that hasn't stopped significant anti-smoking legislation).

Townsend should get a go on the left and whip crosses in with Lamela on the right. That gives us two different options on either wing who both bring something different.

I suppose I'm wondering whether people should be penalised for living outside the city proper but wanting to enjoy proximity to it. If people from outlying areas can't get into the city, park up and enjoy a day there easily, then they'll be more pushed to move into the city and add to the crowding. If meter parking, limited time parking and residents' parking take over Clifton then there really is no option left for anyone wanting to spend the whole day pottering about (as I found when it took nearly a month to get a permit as a new resident in Cotham. Had I moved from Edinburgh, instead of from Clifton, I would have had absolutely no concept of where to put my car that it would be safe, and it was still necessary to park more than 30 mins walking distance away from my house).

true,Machinax,dalek,Dalek,"Just to indulge a little on nomenclature - the 2005 series isn't a reboot. A reboot, by definition, starts the series continuity anew. *Batman Begins*, for example, is a reboot because it re-tells Batman's origin story, contradicting the origin story told in the *Batman* movie of the late 80s. The same with the *Star Trek* 2009 movie, because it effectively resets the established *Star Trek* universe.

To that effect, the 2005 series of *Doctor Who* is not a reboot, since it actually continues the continuity of the original series. If, for example, ""Rose"" had established that Christopher Eccleston was playing the First Doctor, then *that* would be a reboot. 

So, as it stands, the 2005 series is a revival, not a reboot - since, well, it revived a series that was once dead.

true,pikeybastard,null,null,"ASBO's did not work, and they, along with the rest of the 1998 Crime and Disorder Act, were one of the most ineffective and regressive policies of the last few decades. Intended as a continuation of successful decarcerative policies dating since the 1980's (diversionary policies that seek to lead the criminal justice system away from prison), it actually widened the net and brought more young people within the criminal justice system, and encouraged recidivism and criminal persistence amongst young persons that might otherwise have grown up and away from criminal habits.

For one thing, doli incapax was abolished as a principle within the UK justice system, suddenly criminalising children aged 10-14 and bringing them within an adult justice framework. A further concern was that, as ASBO's themselves were granted within a civil rather than criminal framework, failure to comply could lead what was initially a non-criminal, minor act to becoming a criminal conviction. In other words, an offender could go to prison or face community service for an initial offence that would never have even gone to court. Almost half of young people given ASBO's had suffered abuse or had a mental illness, and the association between ASBO's, class and neighbourhood also entrenched divisions in opportunity between different young people. Within the context of the ASBO, where a kid from a nice area would be seen as exuberant, rude and in need of a thick ear, within the context of a poor neighbourhood the child would simply be viewed as an offender and given an ASBO. Although stigmatisation is part of the efficacy of the ASBO model, often stigmatisation itself was the prime mover, creating a self-feeding cycle. 

Indeed, in response to the above criticisms the UN Committee on the Human Rights of the Child singled out the UK as the western country where compliance with the CRC was 'worsening', raising concern about opening young children up to violence, bullying and self-harm. After the 1998 CDA child custody levels rose over 35%- not entirely down to ASBO's, more the 'tough on crime' schtick, but ti was a factor. The Council For Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, Gils-Robles, commented on ASBOs detrimental effect on human rights- ""the ease of obtaining such orders, the broad range of limited behaviour, the publicity surrounding their imposition and the serious consequences of breach all give rise to concern"". 

The number of ASBO breaches, by people of all age groups, also demonstrated that as a policy it was not entirely effective in achieving its aims. Between June 2000 an December 2009, 73% of all ASBO's were breached by those aged between 12-14. 

ASBO's were a disgusting policy that, as Muncie noted, declared people ""offenders first, children second"" and reversed the huge gains made in youth and criminal justice policies since the early 1980's in the UK. There are many reasons why many formerly no-go areas have improved, much of it down to the impressive moves towards decarcerative and restorative justice policies advanced in the mid-90's. Crime was due to go down as more people were going through desistance, diminishing criminal culture and reducing the pool of repeat offenders. ASBO's really weren't it though.

Sorry for the massive response, I just thought that it was important to throw in this two cents on the ASBO issue. For what it's worth I agree with you that this civil injunctions business is a bad and unnecessary policy, and will just widen the net of criminalisation in a terrible way.",0,1384055995,null,0,false,0,cdasptl,t3_1q8ytl,t1_cdasptl,t1_cdahzzj,null,1428721060,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

I'm against wind farms due to them being an incredibly inefficient and weather dependant means of energy production.  Not enough wind?  No power generated.  Too much wind?  Sorry we have to turn them off to prevent them from being damaged.  I'd much rather see the money invested in wave and tidal power instead as this nation has the greatest potential for energy production from the sea than any other nation in Europe as unlike wind, the tides are as regular as clockwork.

We attacked more successfully down the right because Johnson has more pace, better positioning, technical ability, and the ability to go past players.

Cissokho was given the ball, but never went past the defender, and his crosses were always blocked by the first man. Most of the time he just passed it back. I agree he was not terrible, but he pretty much fulfilled the roll of a brick wall with slow legs on it, so why pass to him if he's not going to do anything but pass it back, and can't get into a good position anyway?

I'm not suggesting that Agger is solely responsible, or even responsible at all, for the clean sheets. But as far as defensive units go, our best four results have ALL been with Agger in the side, so I really can't agree with the people who are saying he shouldn't be played.

I haven't been out late nights much in years, but I guess that local councils might have been reluctant to offer later licenses. 

If a pub is granted a later license or 24-hour opening then any trouble associated with that establishment will be taken as evidence against it, used to demonstrate that later or 24-hour licensing is a bad idea and will contribute to denying such licences or renewals in the future. 

This will be done irrespective of the overall effect - if the overall number of disturbances and alcohol-related crime falls, local counsellors won't clap the publican on the back and say ""well done on calming them down and keeping all the troublemakers contained"".

I find the idea of each doctor being a different person but connected fantastic, and I loved Tennant talking about what it feels like to regenerate in ""The End of Time"". Just added extra gravity to the idea, and it's especially beautiful when nine dies, knowing that he's dying and ""a new man swaggers off"", and he just says ""You were fantastic. And so was I."" No tears, no rejection, just acceptance. In that moment, for that reason, he was happy to die, and he was happy to let go of that version of himself. 

I like to think that ten was starting to recover from the guilt and depression, he was starting to feel better, his friends and loved ones kept leaving him, but still. He was doing so well, learning so much, really figuring out how to be the only time lord, and then he realizes he has to go. The way he speaks, like a petulant child at the end is beautiful and heart breaking. Because he knows that, under his own moral code, he has to sacrifice himself for wilfred. But he's finally doing better, he's finally moving on, and then he has to die and become a new man again, and it breaks his heart to think of facing it. But he does, he walks into his death. He doesn't like it, he rejects it, he wishes it didn't have to happen, but he still walks into it. And so the universe sang to him, because he thinks more of others than himself. And he would rather see wilfred live, than himself.

Anyway that's straying from the point a little bit. Tell me who doesn't respect soldiers? People who don't support war? Hippies and college professors?

Instead of people asking - 'do we support our defence policy?', it changes the question to 'do we support our troops?'. Obviously we support the troops - but so long as everyone is rushing to agree that they do indeed support the troops, no one is discussing the defence policy. Even more, it makes people who would say 'no - our ""defence"" policy is built upon a US lead interventionist military industrial complex' look like the bad guys because they're not rushing to show how much they love soldiers.

Just brainstorming crap atm and I’m no Who expert.

I feel like the Rose we’re seeing in the trailer isn’t 10s Rose or Rose after living in Pete’s world.

She speaks differently, she has a much more serious demeanor, and in the trailer at least we never see her with 10. We see her with/talking to the Hurt Doctor and warning him about a moment he needs to be ready for.

When she waves it’s almost a cheeky greeting, likely aimed at 10  or 11, but why not both?

She also has the Bad Wolf eyes.

I’m going to rewatch all the Bad Wolf stuff again to remind myself exactly what happened to Rose with the Time Vortex but if she could see all of time and space then it stands to reason that she could see this dark and troubled Doctor and, in theory, be there for him and to guide him through and out of a dark time.

I believe Day of the Doctor Rose is likely John Hurt Doctor’s companion though he may not know her as Rose or in any way akin to the way he would know her in his future; could know her more as a strangely omniscient mystery woman.

I was thinking more about my Rose theory from the previous post, that the Rose that will appear in the anniversary could be a Bad Wolf version of Rose that came about at the time she absorb edthe Time Vortex and is actually the John Hurt Doctor's companion, and couldn't get over how remarkably different her voice was in the trailer from Rose's normal voice. Sure age will change that but it was crazy how different it was. Figured hey, let's compare.

The bottom waveform is Rose's normal speaking pattern taken from Journey's End in order to get a more somber cadence. The middle is Rose on Satellite 5 after looking into the Heart of the TARDIS. The top is Rose from the trailer. I was only somewhat surprised at how similar Bad Wolf Rose and Trailer Rose were.

Here's Trailer Rose and Bad Wolf Rose overlain: https://soundcloud.com/redundantharpoons/iamthemomentiscoming


And all three separate sounds that I used:



Normal Rose (Journey's End) https://soundcloud.com/redundantharpoons/worstdayofmylife

Bad Wolf Rose https://soundcloud.com/redundantharpoons/badwolfrose

Trailer Rose https://soundcloud.com/redundantharpoons/rosetraileronly



So, in closing, I'm fairly sure we're either looking at a Bad Wolf Rose creation or some version of Rose that is somehow still linked to the vortex without burning up, not the Rose that traveled with 10 or the Rose that ended up in Pete's World.

British comes from the speakers of Brythonic, the former celtic language of (Great) Britain; The inhabitants of Ireland (and later, thanks to emigration Scotland) speak (spoke) Gaelic languages, so describing them as British has never made sense. British people now live in Northern Ireland, but then again they also live in The Falklands, which is not a ""British Isle"".

What's the collective word for Corsica and Sardinia? Why is there a need for a collective name for Britain and Ireland? There wasn't a need for it when you adsorbed us into The United Kingdom of Great Britain and (Northern) Ireland. The term comes from long after that - during a push to try to ""Anglicise"" Ireland in the 1800s which coincided with the outlawing of our language, religion and cultural practices.

This is the second time I've had to do this on /r/UnitedKingdom. ""You"" is the second person plural pronoun, which in British English requires an understanding of the context that the person speaking or writing doesn't literally mean you as an individual, i.e. the second person singular pronoun.

Hiberno-English has ""ye"" for second person plural pronoun, America has ""y'all"". I'd use these terms but I guess I have high expectations of the English comprehension abilities in /r/UnitedKingdom.

By the way, if it weren't for that linguistic eradication I couldn't be living the life of Reilly abroad as an English teacher, so thank *ye* for that, Irish is a clunky language anyway.

&gt; Furthermore, the Greeks (Where the whole 'Britain' thing really came from, in writing anyway) referred to Ireland as one of the Britannic isles over 2000 years ago.

*One* Greek (Egyptian) - Ptolemy, refers to it this way. He is also more famous as having institutionalised the idea of the Earth at the centre of the universe. Let's not appeal to his geography of places he'd never been, shall we?

&gt; When's the last time you heard a Scottish Highlander saying they're not living on the island of Great Britain?

... But they do live there? Gaelic 'highlanders' knew where they were going when they migrated there from the Ulster region. They pushed the Picts (Brythonic speakers) further east and south, where they would later be annihilated and adsorbed by the incoming Saxons - which, since Scots Gaelic and Irish were both the dominant languages in their area by the time they arrive - is what they still call the English and by extension England: Sassanach - the place the Saxons live. In the older languages, the Saxons are the new arrivals to 'Britain'. The Saxons knew they were coming to a British speaking place too, which is why they kept the name.
