true,strolls,null,null,"It's a response to BoJo's speech last week in which he sorta confusedly conflated IQ with wealth.

There was quite a kerfuffle about it, because he seems to have been interpreted as meaning that poor or unintelligent people are undeserving.

Here's the [video](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2013/nov/28/boris-johnson-wealth-envy-inequality-margaret-thatcher-video) and [full text](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/london-mayor-election/mayor-of-london/10480321/Boris-Johnsons-speech-at-the-Margaret-Thatcher-lecture-in-full.html), but I think these are the relevant paragraphs:

*Whatever you may think of the value of IQ tests, it is surely relevant to a conversation about equality that as many as 16 per cent of our species have an IQ below 85, while about 2 per cent have an IQ above 130. The harder you shake the pack, the easier it will be for some cornflakes to get to the top.*

*And for one reason or another – boardroom greed or, as I am assured, the natural and god-given talent of boardroom inhabitants - the income gap between the top cornflakes and the bottom cornflakes is getting wider than ever. I stress: I don’t believe that economic equality is possible; indeed, some measure of inequality is essential for the spirit of envy and keeping up with the Joneses that is, like greed, a valuable spur to economic activity.*

*But we cannot ignore this change in relative economic standing, and the resentment it sometimes brings. Last week I tried to calm people down, by pointing out that the rich paid a much greater share of income tax than they used to.*

*When Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979 they faced a top marginal tax rate of 98 per cent, and the top one per cent of earners contributed 11 per cent of the government’s total revenues from income tax. Today, when taxes have been cut substantially, the top one per cent contributes almost 30 per cent of income tax; and indeed the top 0.1 per cent – just 29,000 people – contribute fully 14 per cent of all taxation.*

*That is an awful lot of schools and roads and hospitals that are being paid for by the super-rich. So why, I asked innocently, are they so despicable in the eyes of all decent British people? Surely they should be hailed like the Stakhanovites of Stalin’s Russia, who half-killed themselves, in the name of the people, by mining record tonnages of coal?*

*I proposed that we should fete them and decorate them and inaugurate a new class of tax hero, with automatic knighthoods for the top ten per cent. Well, my friends, I am proud to say I have often been accused of being out of touch, but hardly ever have I produced so frenzied and hate-filled a response.*

*People aren’t remotely interested in how much tax these characters pay. That does nothing to palliate their primary offence, which is to be so stonkingly and in their view emetically rich.*

I think this shows a remarkable lack of introspection, myself. ",0,1386131997,null,0,false,0,cdt449k,t3_1s12ui,t1_cdt449k,t1_cdsw00h,null,1428403883,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Why did the Doctor say it? ""Rule number 1: The Doctor lies."" Why did the Master see it in a retinal scan? The TARDIS is sentient and obviously takes more of a liking to the Doctor than the Master. Maybe the TARDIS lies too. It could have altered the image to make the Master think that. Maybe the Doctor set up some sort of a ruse where if someone opened the Eye of Harmony for the purpose of stealing his fully Time Lord body, both he and the TARDIS would try and convince the person doing it that he was actually half human. Knowing he was being watched through the Eye of Harmony, he said out loud that he was half human. Perhaps this would dissuade the person trying to steal his body from doing so if they wanted/needed a fully Time Lord body. In this case it didn't work so the plan is simply dropped.

true,showmethefever,flair8,,"First of all, a five back system is fucking stupid for us. There's no way around it. Aside from the West Ham and City game, we've been great defensively. Not to mention, our strongest position with the most depth is in the midfield, so why would we want to sacrifice a spot there for a position that doesn't need any help?

Secondly, Soldado needs more service, not more shots from Defoe. It's bad enough that he has to play in front of inverted wingers who take too many shots (looking at you Townsend) and then has to take all of this criticism. He is a great finisher who is capable of getting into dangerous positions and just needs service. This is why I want Townsend on the left, because he is capable of using both feet and good at beating defenders one-on-one and crossing the ball. 

Staying on the topic of Townsend, why would we put him in the middle? We have Eriksen, Holtby, Sigurdsson, Lamela, Chadli and Dembele who are all more capable of playing there. Townsend is fast and good on the ball, or otherwise known as a winger. These players are much better of distributing the ball and have actually played in the middle. 

If we're going to have two strikers, then Adebayor would be one and Soldado or Defoe would be the other. Putting two pure finishers up top is as much waste of a spot in the lineup as using five in the back when we've been perfectly fine defensively. That said, what does Adebayor offer that the previously mentioned options for the attacking midfielder don't? Sure, he's good at holding up play and scoring, but so are those players and they are much, much better at passing. 

Basically, this formation is terrible.

From all their data, scientists are pretty sure the Higgs Boson exists.  They call it ""Sigma 5"" or five standard deviations from the norm, which means there's a [99.99999999% chance that it exists](http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/143497-cern-now-99-999999999-sure-it-has-found-the-higgs-boson).  You may have seen polls that talk about data being right 19 times out of 20, this is ""Sigma 2"" or 2 standard deviations.

Now, let's go back to the card example.  Shuffling a deck gives a lot of combinations: 52 factorial (written 52!) which is 52 * 51 * 50 * ... * 3 * 2 * 1 ways of assembling a deck.  52! is about 8 * 10^67, or 8 with 67 zeros after it.  That's an unbelievably huge number.

You have no idea how unbelievably huge 8 * 10^67 number is.  If the net worth of planet earth was about 5,000 trillion dollars, and there are 500,000,000,000 stars in the galaxy, each star with 10 planet Earths, and the universe contained 500,000,000,000 galaxies, 8 * 10^67 dollars could buy you the entire wealth of 6 * 10^30 universes, filled to the brim with rich planet Earths.  When you were a kid and thinking inifinity was a big number, this number is much bigger.  And Infinity is much bigger than that.

Let's make some assumptions about the card example.

Let's assume playing cards have been around for 1000 years.  In those 1000 years, let's assume new generations every 20 years (way too fast) and that each generation has 10 billion people (way too many), and that each person in their lifetime shuffles a deck of cards 1 billion times (way, way too many).

That's 50 generations * 10,000,000,000 * 1,000,000,000 = 5 * 10^20 shuffles of decks of all decks of cards ever.  Remember this number is far, far too large, but it's an ""upper bound"".

Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that none of these cards in the past has ever been a repeat of one before.  So the odds if you getting an existing card sequence is  ( 5 * 10^20 ) / ( 8 * 10^67 ), which is about 1 in 10^47 odds. That's equivelant to a person winning a 6 pick lottery 6 times consecutively without cheating.  It's also 1 in 10^57 times less likely to happen than the Higgs Boson not existing.  If people had been alive since the age of the universe, playing cards constantly for their entire lives, breaking only occasionally to make more children to play cards, the chances of their being a duplicate in those 14 billion years is still so remote as to be inconceivable.

Sorry, I strayed over the ELI5 line.  ELI5:  If you put enough cards into the deck (and 52 is more than enough), the age of the universe just isn't long enough for something like this to have happened.

It doesn't surprise me Madrid are looking to sell to Arsenal. They have more money to spend than us and Levy may not have been able to match their offer. Same goes for Ozil. I also trust Bandini is able to consult Levy in value of players for AVB. 

Levy had the perfect time to sell a large asset and turn some of the profits into multiple young developing players. We can expect some of the funds to building the new stadium.

Spurs are on the rise and are Levy is making the right decisions for the future of Spurs.

TL;DR Madrid is mad at Spurs for selling big and Levy knows what he's doing. ",0,1386138873,null,0,false,0,cdt6k9d,t3_1rzz6i,t1_cdt6k9d,t1_cdso52i,null,1428402742,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

I personally think Gerrard and Lucas both need to step it up and step it up quickly. 

Everytime I say it people throw stats at me trying to justify their places but I think they are a bit blinded by the reputation and their names.. truth is Gerrard *is* in decline, good player still, but he's not the same (that's not to say he's not still essential or replaceable), I think its time BR becomes the one to start rotating him. 

Lucas can be so effective for us but when he disappears in games, we get opened up and fucked up.... and its painfully apparent to anybody that watched the everton and hull game how crucial the DM role is for us.

true,Lit-Up,null,null,"Just another misuse of the term ""nationalist"" on this sub. As you're trying to find the Irish equivalent of a loyalist, you would do better to use the term republican, although there isn't really any equivalence between loyalists and republicans other than that they're working class.

I've thought long and hard about what republicans might admire in loyalists, and I just can't come up with anything. The problem is that irrespective of your political opinion - republican, socialist, conservative, libertarian, you name it - there is absolutely nothing in loyalism to admire, to respect, to acknowledge. The ONLY grouping who is going to find anything to admire in loyalism are the extreme right - fascists and racists.

You just need to look at their slogans to see what loyalism is about. 

""We are the people"" - chauvinism.

""For God and Ulster"" - religious fundamentalism mixed with extreme nationalism

""No surrender"" - unreflective intransigence

""God save the queen"" - blind idol worship

As for what loyalists admire in republicans, I don't think they have the humility to concede 'admiration' for republicans. Some loyalist people probably envy how republican paramilitaries active during the Troubles have decommissioned and do not intimidate their own neighbourhoods or peddle drugs. Then again so many supposedly ordinary loyalists have strong connections with active paramilitaries (like poor wee Tracey Coulter).... so it's hard to take these protestations seriously. Anybody with sense would move out of these areas if they wanted no association with paramilitaries.

Other loyalists may envy the more developed artistic and intellectual heritage of republicanism, (but probably not as most can't read good)... as well as the Irish language, thinking it's ridiculous that they need to pretend that Ulster Scots is actually a language (a notion which only emerged in the 1980s).

In terms of jealousy, they would probably like to have efficient political representation like Sinn Fein provides. The political organisation and success of Sinn Fein says much about the capability of republicans, and the political failure of loyalism says the contrary about loyalists. This is hardly surprising when you consider that when republicans were in jail they read up and self-educated, when loyalists were in jail they bulked up and drank steroids. Like him or loathe him, there's a reason why someone like Gerry Kelly can be found in the assembly, whilst his opposite numbers in loyalism can only be found in the local Rangers supporters club.

Lucas can cut the middle pass out, but because our wingers don't track back, the ball has gone to the opposing fullbacks.

In a BO5 they'd have to lose twice then win twice.

It is a knife in the back over here in the UK as well as in America. 

It is nothing short of a global coup by corporations seeking to undermine laws in almost every area that West has built up - from environmental to pharmeceutical 

&gt;It also gave the executive branch – which is generally much less accountable to public pressure than the Congress – a means of negating and pre-empting important legislation by our elected representatives. Laws to protect the environment, food safety, consumers (from monopoly pricing), and other public interest concerns can now be traded away in ""trade"" negotiations. And US law must be made to conform to the treaty.

And like Newspeak and Doublethink, this isn't even a free trade deal. In fact it's the exact opposite of a free trade deal. In fact the core tenets of the agreement are essentially in extending patents on (but not limited to) medicines for further years and ensuring patents apply cross-countries. With this agreement you may as well get rid of any ideas of being in a sovereign country and we may as well throw our parliament out as they'll only be middle men to corporate shills 

&gt;But the TPP and its promoters are full to the brim with ironies. It is quite amazing that a treaty like the TPP can still be promoted as a ""free trade"" agreement when its most economically important provisions are the exact opposite of ""free trade"" – the expansion of protectionism.

&gt;Exhibit A was released by WikiLeaks last week: the latest draft of the ""intellectual property"" chapter of the agreement, one of 24 (out of 29) chapters that do not have to do with trade. This chapter has provisions that will make it easier for pharmaceutical companies to get patents, including in developing countries; have these patents for more years; and extend the ability of these companies to limit access to the scientific data that is necessary for other researchers to develop new medicines. And the United States is even pushing for provisions that would allow surgical procedures to be patented – provisions that may be currently against US law.

&gt;All of these measures will help raise the price of medicines and health care, which will strain public health systems and price some people out of the market for important medicines. It is interesting to see how much worse the TPP is than the WTO's Trips (Trade-Related Aspects of International Property Rights). This, too, was a massive rip-off of consumers and patients throughout the world, but after years of struggle by health advocates and public interest groups, some of its worst features were attenuated, and further consolidation of pharmaceutical companies' interests were blocked.

He gathers years worth of wind data from things called lydars and sodars and met masts which are fecking huge. Then he works with the GIS team to map every last tree on the site then he uses a lot more pieces of software than just CAD stuff to work out the best combination of turbines and placements. It's not just about getting the most on the field though, a turbine will take like 30% of the energy out of the wind so all of that has to be factored. And then he has to work out profitable it all is and if its worth the company investing in the site. 

Though that is for onshore. Offshore costs way more to build and youve got to factor in shipping lanes etc. He mainly works on onshore projects though.

side note: I think the whole 4-3-3 is a terrible formation for our squad and believe the 3-5-2 better suites our needs, I think the recent flip flop between the 2 has really thrown some of our players off.. 

Dont get me wrong i fully understand the temptation for him to chase and break down players before they become a problem but its when he goes and gets himself in that guard dog mentality and then disappears from his marking zone when he's constantly chasing down the ball then all of a sudden he clicks that he's out of position and nobody is back their to do his work.

I could get really technical on this because there is a lot of minor issues and variables and technicalities that could be brought up but im trying not to because 1) thats like work 2) its reaaally boring, but i think the main straight to the point problem is a balance between Gerrard and Lucas, they both need to do their assigned roles and not too much of each others because thats when the trouble starts, allow hendo to do the heavy running leg work and defend or press on their behalf if need be, he may not be the most technical player but he works hard and you can never fault that.

A good rule of thumb is to avoid South and East Leeds: Burmantofts, Harehills, Chapeltown, Hunslet, Halton, Gipton, Beeston, Cross Gates, Seacroft and surrounding areas have deprivation and can be scary at night.

North of all that is the rich bit: Roundhay, Adel, Alwoodley... all mansions and golf courses. Expensive and boring.

West of that you have the student belt: Headingley, Meanwood, Kirkstall. Don't live here if you don't want to be woken up at 4am by people in disco wigs shouting in the street. Also, proximity to the shitty bit and large transient xbox-owning student population means a lot of burglaries. 

Further wast is are your middle class suburbs: Horsforth, Rawdon, Calverley, Farsley and Yeadon, Guiseley, Menston further out. If you're working and have a family these are the best areas of Leeds to live.

I doubt there's much 'community' in the city centre to be honest. I think most of those 'exclusive' riverside developments are destined to be slums.

Personally I think Horsforth is the best place to live in Leeds. Chapel Allerton is okay as well.

&gt;I cycle on pavement not very often and even if I do it's not when there are pedestrians (or very few). Dick move it's being an ""angel"" and getting killed as very often those ""pavements"" are countryside where no pedestrians walk at all. Is this still a dick move?

Ignoring the fact that this makes very little sense, how would breaking the rules make you an angel and not a dick? yes it is still a dick move because you're on a road vehicle and you have no idea if a pedestrian might come round the corner or through a gap in the hedge.

&gt;If pedestrians were also so fucking great why do they cross the road NOT on actual road crossings but between cars? 

Two things. firstly pedestrians have the right to cross most roads provided they are definately clear of moving vehicles, secondly we already covered the fact that other road users acting out does not give you the right to act out and not be called a dick.

&gt;how the fuck is this different from cycling on a pavement where officials hasn't yet decided to paint it?

because where it's marked there is usually enough space for both, and the pedestrians are aware that they need to watch out for cyclists, where it's not they shouldn't have to anticipate you on your bike.

&gt;Dick move is not thinking objectively and being 100% ""legal"". If you want for cyclist to be perfectly ""legal"" and don't cause ""mayhem"" on pavements then government should recognise cyclist as the third group of road users and make proper arrangements for them to use roads/pavements, which WON'T risk their lives.

they are recognised as a gorup of road users, hence why there are a specific set of rules and seporate lanes in a lot of places for cyclists, and also hence why they are banned from riding on the pavement. 

We're going round in circles here mate, you can use the pavement for safety, but you have a duty to keep the pavements safe by dismounting and walking on them, otherwise it's a total dick move

&gt;There is no way to cycle only on cycle routes as there are too few of them. 

So you have to dismount and walk or go on the road. Inconvenience of having to walk is no excuse to ride the pavement, that would be a dick move.

&gt;And if you want to be a HERO and not scare old granda, by slowly passing by her on the pavements, where car traffic is huge (or with high speed) and risk your life because of that, then that's completely your choice.

Yes it's my choice to follow the law and not be a dick, if you are scared of traffic at certain junctions and roads then WALK on the pavement

&gt;After all, this is not regulated thing enough. I'm not going through red lights with my car, though plenty of people still do and I should be bothered by occasional use of pavements for safety reasons?

again, drivers who do that are making a bigger dick move, but it does not change the fact that riding on the pavement is also a dick move.

You're so full of shit, please admit that it is **NOT** for safety reasons that you ride the pavement, it is dangerous and you do it for the **convenience** of not walking

&gt; *Published at 12:01AM, November 29 2013*
&gt;
&gt; **People in their twenties today face unprecedented debts
from university fees, high unemployment and historically
high rents**
&gt;
&gt; Sir, Lisa Brinkworth implies that the current generation of young adults who live in their parents’ houses are feckless, and says that she worked hard to own her own home in her twenties
&gt;
&gt; We all think we work hard, and that we earned our good fortune. In reality Brinkworth bought during the mid 1990s, when the average UK home cost less than three times the average wage. I doubt she could repeat the trick today, when that ratio is over ﬁve, and more than eight in London. This inﬂation has delivered huge benefits to the old at the expense of the young. It is propped up by a series of  government policies and failures, including historically low rates of housebuilding, low interest rates, untaxed foreign speculation on property, and the new Help to Buy scheme. 
&gt;
&gt; People in their twenties today face unprecedented debts from university fees, high unemployment and historically high rents, which they pay to landlords whose average age is reportedly 53. These landlords benefit from significant tax breaks, and cheap mortgages, due to the unearned wealth already accumulated from house-price inﬂation. 
&gt;
&gt; Current forecasts show that the younger generation may be the ﬁrst in the UK with a worse living standard than that of their parents. Yet they will be forced to pay off our national debt, and then provide an income, medical treatment and social care for a wealthy ageing population who have promised each other huge benefits without thinking to fund them. We should be grateful to the young, not rude, and pray that they do not turn.

--------------------------------------

very briefly.

-Migs-

-Sakho-Skrtel-Agger- (Sakho and Agger engage while Skrtel stays back to enforce)

-Lucas- (in CM but drops back to play DM role)

-Johnson-Hendo-Gerrard-Enrique- (Johnson and Enrique play wing back role, can drop back if need be to play 5 in defence and push forward with Stevie so there's 5 up front)

-Coutinho/Suarez- (can drop back into the middle of the pitch to support the CM and wingbacks and can also press forward to support the forward ---- Gerrard in the same way Lucas drops back will be deeper than the other CM's and act as an AM and CM)

-Sturridge/Suarez-

its not so much counter attacking mind state formation although defensively it comes across as counter attack, its more that the shape of the formation allows for the wingbacks to play as defenders, wingers and inside forwards effectively meaning that depending on where the ball is on the pitch we can have 5 players back, in the middle or up front without compromising our defense or opening us up to counter attacks.

So if I cycle and am somewhere on A type road, where there is side pavement where nobody walks (and there is a forest on the side), I need to now get of the bicycle and WALK it for couple of miles just because it officially isn't recognised and painted as a cycle route? Or just go along on main road with cars who travel up to 70mph? Human's life is too precious to ignore it, so if you want to go ""cycling"" and then risk your life and end up dead, or walk your bicycle because of stupid rules not taking into account cyclist's opinions as there are too few of them, then good luck in your life!

Around at least 95% of all road and pavement users in UK are DICKS, judging by your approach. Drivers are even bigger DICKS as when they don't use turning signals where required they risk lives. Tell me, how many people died in road collisions and with collisions of cyclists and pedestrians? 

Also, what is the law? In some other countries drivers are punished for not using turning signals (which in my opinion is fucking important). In UK someone yet hasn't recognised it as important as maybe he himself never faced a situation where by cycling a driver wanted to crush him as he didn't bother looking into mirror nor signalling his turn.

P.S. You are right that people should obey law but most of them don't, especially in things which they think aren't that much important. If all drivers always used signals and always kept enough distance from the bicycle I wouldn't mind driving along on roads with them. BUT they don't! Why should I then obey ""law"", which is stupid on that account and risk my life?

          Henderson         Coutinho
                Aspas    Suarez

That's what I think the lineup may be, as in those are the players that will be on the pitch and not necessarily the shape they will be, Henderson may be in the middle, Aspas on the right etc.

There was no creativity or anything in the front four on Sunday and starting Aspas and Coutinho tonight could help there, we all know what Coutinho can do but Aspas has shown in doses that he can mix it up and be a bit unpredictable. Henderson can do his usual shtick of running about and pressing the opposition and try get the ball to the creative players and allow them to their thing, a front three of Aspas, Coutinho and Suarez should be able to produce something. Alberto should feature at some point too.

Moses and Sterling will be dropped, they offered nothing on Sunday. Sterling should be sent on loan in January to somewhere he can play every week, he's still very young and consistent playing time will help him. Moses' head is still in London it seems.

Lucas will start I think. Gerrard or Allen, I'm not actually sure, I've a feeling we may see Gerrard rested as we have three games in the space of a week and he'll be kept fresh for the weekend game against West Ham. It's not about him being dropped because of the game on Sunday but fitness might be an issue. I'd like to see an Allen - Lucas partnership and see how they get on (how many times have we ever seen it?). It's Steven Gerrard though, so most likely he'll start.

Hopefully we'll see Sakho in the team, he has shown that he is good enough and deserves a run in the team. Skrtel, the two deflected goals were a touch of bad luck and hasn't done anything else really to warrant being dropped. Glenjo and Flanagan at full back. Mignolet between the sticks.

We need a win and I expect us to do that, if we really are competing for top 4 this season then we should be beating Norwich. A defeat and we could end up further down the table making it a disastrous start to a month in which the toughest part is still to come.

Liverpool 2-0. If Norwich win, meltdown.

**EDIT**

Looking at training photos, if the bib theory is to go by it'll be - Mignolet, Johnson, Skrtel, Agger, Flanagan, Gerrard, Henderson, Coutinho, Sterling &amp; Suarez, there was only 9 players in green bibs photographed so the last two will be a surprise. Lucas is in an orange bib so it means he could be dropped.

&gt;So if I cycle and am somewhere on A type road, where there is side pavement where nobody walks (and there is a forest on the side), I need to now get of the bicycle and WALK it for couple of miles just because it officially isn't recognised and painted as a cycle route?

yes, not just now it's been the rule since the highway code was written. it hasnt been recognised as a cycle route because it *isnt* a cycle route.

&gt;Or just go along on main road with cars who travel up to 70mph? Human's life is too precious to ignore it, so if you want to go ""cycling"" and then risk your life and end up dead, or walk your bicycle because of stupid rules not taking into account cyclist's opinions as there are too few of them, then good luck in your life!

yes walk, you have legs use them. The choice is be dangerous or walk, so walk fool. the *opinion* of a cyclist is no more important than that of the pedestrian, you're not a special case pedestrians are entitled to the pavement and cyclists are not, it's that simple. Again it's no use encouraging cycling if you just do it by making even more people afraid to be pedestrian.

&gt;Around at least 95% of all road and pavement users in UK are DICKS, judging by your approach.

well they are to be fair

&gt;Drivers are even bigger DICKS as when they don't use turning signals where required they risk lives. Tell me, how many people died in road collisions and with collisions of cyclists and pedestrians?

circular, a lot of driver are dicks and worse and it's not acceptable to behave as they do, but that doesnt give you the right to do whatever the fuck you please regardless of anyone else.

&gt;Also, what is the law? In some other countries drivers are punished for not using turning signals (which in my opinion is fucking important). In UK someone yet hasn't recognised it as important as maybe he himself never faced a situation where by cycling a driver wanted to crush him as he didn't bother looking into mirror nor signalling his turn.

we're not in other countries though are we(although I think they mostly have an off the pavement approach to cyclists too), the law here is very clear on what you can and can't do on a pavement. and that's bullshit any police would do a driver they saw doing that for dangerous driving.

&gt;You are right that people should obey law but most of them don't, especially in things which they think aren't that much important. If all drivers always used signals and always kept enough distance from the bicycle I wouldn't mind driving along on roads with them. BUT they don't! Why should I then obey ""law"", which is stupid on that account and risk my life? An idiot in his 4x4 won't even notice me when he knocks me down (look at recent idiot who twittered about it, blaming cyclist). It's you who are full of shit as you think that society is ideal.

so because cyclists are in danger that gives you the right to pass the danger on to pedestrians? 

break the law if you will but be under no illusions, it's always a dick move. 

Im full of shit because you ride on the pavement and endanger pedestrians for your own convenience. good logic there mate.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Current forecasts show that the younger generation may be the ﬁrst in the UK with a worse living standard than that of their parents

This is of course unfounded nonsense. The current generation of young already enjoy a much better standard of living than their parents - most obvious in technology and medicine. What he means is 'smaller houses and less disposable income' - but more food and drink, more technology and more free time (sorry that last one is a joke about lack of work). 

Edit - bot more info:

This generation has same (not lower) household income than the one tens years earlier. Still much higher than their parents generation. http://blogs.r.ftdata.co.uk/money-supply/files/2012/03/18-March-2012-jinxed-generation-1.jpg

EDIT: To the replies - the jist of what I am saying is that actually the living standards in the long term are certainly higher - specifically higher than their parents generation. They are just not higher in the short term (people 10 years older) - and given the fact that we have had a massive recession not a surprise - and hopefully will be corrected in the medium term. The idea that the young are suffering a mean living standards issue vs parents is ludicrous. But certainly there are some ugly problems with unemployment and finding somewhere to live for many. But historical context and not judging everything on the short term is important!

EDIT 2: Here is another example. Food prices are much cheaper than 1-2 decades a go - but have risen in the short term in the UK (36% since beginning of recession - mainly to do with the fact that the market has taken it - in Ireland they have only risen 6%) http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-VeC39yh6nc/TVC702DN77I/AAAAAAAADSw/QOFB7xKLkk4/s1600/food%2Bdeflated%2Bby%2Bwages.png

true,King_of_Avalon,eu,Croatian,"&gt; But the cost of credit was substantially greater. So the low principal was offset by the fact that the cost of the mortgage was much higher.

That is true. Looking back at variable mortgage rates, I can only find [data reaching back to 1997](http://www.housepricecrash.co.uk/graphs-base-rate-uk.php), where it was hovering around 8.5% - 9.5%, whereas now it looks like the average rate is around 2.5%. 

&gt; Real wages in 2011 had increased by 62% since the mid-80s on average, with a 70% increase in the lowest decile. This isn't America, wage increases below inflation are a relatively recent UK phenomenon. 

Is this for all wages, or for graduate/junior salaries? That's what I'm most interested in. For example, [this article is saying that](http://www.insidecareers.co.uk/career-advice/graduate-salaries-in-2013/) outside of London, the 2013 graduate's average salary was £24k-£25k, although that actually seems a bit high to me. All of the salaries I see are normally £21k-£23k, and that's in the south-east. I can't find any hard sources about graduate salaries in the '80s and '90s; the only thing I can get is [this from 2004](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/3893107.stm), which anecdotally looks to show that in 2004, graduate salaries were similar to now, and in the early '90s, they ranged between £10k and £20k per year.

Using calculations [provided by this site](http://www.measuringworth.com/ppoweruk/), a starting salary of £12,000pa in 1993 is equal to roughly exactly £20,000pa today using the retail price index, and £23,000pa using an average earnings index. Furthermore, using data from [this site](http://www.housepricecrash.co.uk/indices-nationwide-national-inflation.php), you can see that the average house price in 1992/3 was right at around £50,000, not adjusted for inflation. That's pretty steep if you're a graduate earning £12,000 per year. However, turning towards Q2 of 2013, the number is closer to £170,000, which is even worse if you're only making in the low £20ks, even if access to a mortgage is more easily available. You still have higher prices. However, you're right and I was mistaken - most wages have risen in line with inflation and the CPI up until around 2008 [according to this](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/apr/15/minimum-wage-increases-versus-inflation) and the [Daily Mail](http://www.google.hr/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CD4QFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailymail.co.uk%2Fnews%2Farticle-2476258%2FFamilies-face-fifth-year-pay-rise-pain-incomes-fall-inflation-again.html&amp;ei=hhKfUtbEDsuf7AbG4YCoCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGn8saIJALv2Z5EO1y7rBd29on1TQ&amp;sig2=3xVqQYnphOQEdkhhQR38FQ&amp;bvm=bv.57155469,d.ZGU), or since 2010 according to [The Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/jobs/9867420/Pay-rises-outstripped-by-inflation.html).",0,1386157008,null,0,false,0,cdt9wpa,t3_1s2h8o,t1_cdt9wpa,t1_cdt9lf1,null,1428401110,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

Just look at the UK. In the industrial age we had terrible sweat shops, child labour and horrible pollution. Eventually, working conditions, assisting technology and labour and environmental laws improved, meaning much better pay and conditions for the labour and a much cleaner environment.

China is going through that same industrialisation phase now, albeit at a much larger scale. They are investing a lot in renewable energies though, significantly more than western countries, especially the US. The labour situation is also changing gradually as the population becomes more educated and demands better pay and conditions.

So in time, they will have the expertise and resources to move out of their industrial age just like we did. And they will have the same problems with inequality and an unemployed unskilled workers as we do.

They claim to be communist but capitalism is driving everything in China nowadays. China is well on track to become just as wealthy, unequal, selfish and materialistic as the US.

I'm glad that the UK has enough real socialism in its culture to stop us from going to far down the path of selfishness, personal greed and capitalism. Although even we are in danger of this at the moment.

It is very unlikely Lego would end up licensing Dr. Who as they are extremely particular in their licensing.  They already have the lock down on Star Wars and Lord if the Rings as well as many architectural building sets and they do that extremely well. 

It is much more likely that Megablok would license Dr. Who along with all of their various other licensing such as video games like World of Warcraft and others. I'm not here to knock Megablok but I will say that I hope they don't license Dr. Who simply because technically speaking, they are a lower quality than Lego. The pieces of one set are often off in tiny increments from other sets which can lead to gaps or sets not fitting together properly.

true,_njd_,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"A report from the [Democracy Institute](http://democracyinstitute.org), founded by someone who [looks like a friend of Ron Burgundy](http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/authors/basham.jpg).

Here's the [report](http://democracyinstitute.org/_literature_128773/2013_Dec_4_Democracy_Institute_releases_its_alarming_new_report_on_EU_migration) (PDF).

It says the estimate is 

&gt; Based upon data produced by the
Democracy Institute’s proprietary
econometric migration model

(p14)

I haven't seen an explanation of their model in the report. I think ""proprietary"" here means ""We're not going to explain how we pulled these numbers out of our arse"".  

Where do the figures come from?

&gt;[A] survey by pollsters Afis found that
400,000 people – more than 5 per cent of
the population – indicated they would leave
the country in the next two years, with UK
the destination of choice for nearly a
quarter of the would-be migrants.

Just under 100,000 in two years, about 1.25% of the population. What else?

&gt; Previously, Spain, Greece, and Italy had
been Bulgarians’ top venues for migration
because of the language similarities. Now,
Britain and Germany are preferred.

A quarter of the 5% would be coming to Britain (Britain seems to be conflated with the UK in this report), so I suppose we assume the rest of that 5% would be choosing Germany, Spain, Greece or Italy.

What next?

&gt; If the same percentage is repeated from
January 2014, it is estimated that **80,000**
Bulgarians will arrive in Britain over the next
two years.

&gt; An earlier BBC poll of
Bulgarians and Romanians found 1 per cent
of Romanians and 4 per cent of Bulgarians
said they were looking for work in the UK.
Those percentages convert to a total of
**350,000** potential job-seekers.

Which estimate is correct? 80,000 or 350,000?

Neither.

&gt; Our model projects that, over the next five
years, at least 385,000 migrants will move.

But this model is not explained. They just announce a figure of 385,000 and leave it there.  
Until they can back up their figures I'm going to call it scare-mongering.

It gets pounded into your head from a fairly early age that anything you do academic wise is not good enough, you trudge through that gauntlet of secondary school, college, university only to end up out in the wild world of the job market.

Then once you're there you are branded as lazy or a waster for not having a job. If you decide that any job is better than no job and take up say a low skill job as a shelf stacker, you become a failure to smug assholes ""I never went to uni and look how good my job/life is!"". 

Or if you decide to hold out and look for a better job more related to what you spent 3 years studying and working towards you become a benefits scrounger, a lazy work dodger, ""Get off your high horse!"" etc.

Imagine if you decide to re-enter education at a lower level! Retrain as a plumber or spark or go the vocational route into being an engineer or something then you get looked upon as if your fucking insane.

&gt;While at Lochaber he excelled in Maths and science subjects,[5] before reading Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) at St Anne's College, Oxford.[6]

&gt;In 1993 and 1994, Alexander worked as a press officer with the Scottish Liberal Democrats, before spending eight years as the Director of Communications at the European Movement (1996–1999) and its successor organisation, the Britain in Europe campaign (1999–2004).

&gt;In 2004 and 2005, he was the Head of Communications for the recently formed Cairngorms National Park Authority.

&gt;At the start of the new parliament in 2005, Alexander was appointed by party leader Charles Kennedy as a junior spokesman for Work and Pensions, responsible for disability issues, where he contributed to debates on incapacity benefit reform, the Child Support Agency and the Turner Report on future pension provision in the UK. He was also a member of the Scottish Affairs Select Committee (2005–2008).

&gt;In 2007, he was appointed as Liberal Democrat Shadow Secretary of State for Social Exclusion for six months, before becoming Liberal Democrat Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, holding the post until June 2008. He gave this post up to focus on his role as chief of staff to the new party leader, Nick Clegg, as well as his responsibility for leading the preparation of the party's election manifesto.[8]

&gt;In June 2008 Alexander gave up his role shadowing the Work and Pensions brief to become Chief of Staff to the Leader of the Liberal Democrats, Nick Clegg.[9] As part of his role Alexander became the main author of the 2010 Liberal Democrat general election manifesto and became a confidant of the leader.[10] After the election Alexander became one to the key negotiators in the coalition discussions with the Conservatives and played a key role in the negotiating of the Coalition agreement alongside Oliver Letwin.[11]

He is never going to be a guy who is constantly sprinting around the pitch that's just not something he does.  

He is also one of those players who's football IQ is just enormous, even now when you watch him you see him pick out passes and fire off shots that few people would see, the problem with this is that on Fulham his teammates for the most part don't see the game the same way as him, so you continually see him frustrated because he put a ball somewhere he felt a teammate should have been only for the teammate to not be there. 

It always struck me as Berba's ""football language"" tends to get lost in translation to his teammates and this frustrates him to no end.  Its a bit like Roy Keane's  seeming inability to understand how people aren't as good as him and don't see the game the way he did/does.  Keane would always hustle despite this flaw, Berba strolls.

I would probably pass on Berba, he is immensely talented, but he has been off form for most of the season and who knows if he could find that form with us.  If he did....great. However, if he didn't....he wouldn't bring a ton to the team.

Hopefully Sandro/Small Paul were able to help as well.

true,TheEconomnomist,null,null,"* Tickets can be bought [here](http://www.whufcboxoffice.com/)
* Seats-wise, I've always been a fan of the Dr Marten stand, which is now called the Alpari stand. These tickets are the most expensive generally and that's where most (maybe all) of the season ticket holders sit. You'll generally find that this stand is quite friendly and full of blokes who know each other after years of sitting near to each other every week. The Alpari is the main stand and has a very good atmosphere and a great view of the entire pitch if you get seats somewhere in-line with the halfway line, though the tickets cost more. Alternatively, the Bobby Moore stand is always a sound choice, it's behind one of the goals and has a fantastic atmosphere with lots of passionate fans. If you sit in the lower tear then don't expect to be sat down for long, as people tend to stand and sing all match.

It's worth noting that this season the atmosphere at Upton Park hasn't been as good as it has been in the past, due to the poor performances/results. This might not be an issue for you, but just be aware that if things aren't going well then expect swearing and anger around you, which might be an issue if you'd be taking kids with you.

Also, if you are travelling by tube then Upton Park station can get very busy after a match with lengthy queues, so many fans will either walk to Plaistow or East Ham stations in order to get on the train before it reaches Upton Park, depending on which direction you are heading.

If you want to really soak up some West Ham atmosphere before the match then I'd advise going to The Boleyn pub on the corner of Green Street and Barking Road. It's a very busy pub and is not children friendly, but well worth a pint in there pre-match if you are so inclined.

For buying, the easiest place in the UK is (in my opinion) localbitcoins.com. Recently the prices have even dipped below the MtGox rate and are rather competitive for the UK, which is great. You are buying from another person and so you pay them direct - be in it cash, bank transfer or another method. My recommendation is bank transfer for ease and safety. When you purchase, the Bitcoins are moved into escrow so it is super safe in that regard. Sellers can't sell more Bitcoins than they have in their wallet at LocalBitcoins.  
  
Once you've bought on that site your Bitcoins will be transferred to a wallet associated with your account on LocalBitcoins. You can then transfer it to any wallet you want (for a tiny fee, something like 5 pence). I would recommend the MultiBit software wallet - http://multibit.org.  
  
Once you have that software wallet, add a secure password to it so your coins are encrypted. You should also consider backing everything up in a couple places - I store my backups on an external HDD and in the cloud (both in encrypted folders for adding security).

don't know about your specific case, but most people 18 now will live healthily much much longer. 

Public sector pensions are much more generous - they will change in the coming years and longer lives make it impossible to afford them as a country. Everyone does indeed need to save some of their money right now to pay for the older years that simply didnt exist for people a generation a go. This has an impact on living standards but does not offset other improvements.

There's several different ones (each ISP is registered with 1), the ofcom website says that Zen Internet is also registered with CISAS, so it is them through whom you should make a complaint.

Virgin Media eventually backed down shortly before a decision was due to be reached.

You can make a complaint directly to OFCOM, but it won't help you, still a good thing to do though as it may prompt an investigation at a later date.

In the first instance, you should inform them that you are refusing to pay and state why. Do this in writing and keep a copy of this and any reply from them. If they try to reply by phone, refuse to talk to them and insist upon a written reply (you can't rely on that phone call for evidence).

It is important to note that they are not allowed to commence any debt collection actions while the bill is in the process of being disputed. One of the factors that strongly helped my case was that Virgin Media improperly instructed debt collectors to persue me and later lied about it. As for the debt collectors, they sent me a letter but after I informed them that Virgin Media had acted against trading standards guidelines by instructing them to collect the debt, they were very reasonable and agreed not to act while I dealt with Virgin Media.

You need to wait 8 weeks after your first complaint before you can directly apply to CISAS.

I think Gerrard has always been an impact player and thats why I play him attacking midfield. Coutinho left with Sterling right and obviously Luis up front. 

I personally think that at his best, you lose something when you play Coutinho away from the center but he has not been at his best since May. What has nagged me since this weekend is the attitude of the players, poor performances are part of football but the poor attitude and the absolute lack of any impact to bring off the bench is for me worrying.

Obama brushed off the UK with American officials ""livid at the UK"". The below quote from the following article tells you the US did not give a shit that the UK voted no. Obama even stated he would go to war without congress approval.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/10274955/Syria-crisis-America-could-launch-military-strikes-without-Britains-support.html

&gt;But the White House made clear they would not change course in light of the Commons vote. 



&gt;“The President believes that there are core interests at stake for the United States, and that countries who violate international norms regarding chemical weapons need to be held accountable,” said Caitlin Hayden, a spokesman for Mr Obama’s National Security Council.

&gt;US officials also said they would not be constrained by the collapse of efforts at the United Nations, where an “intransigent” Russia has made clear it would veto any resolution to use force.

&gt;White House officials told CNN that “unilateral action” may now be necessary in Syria, citing sources saying that it was now a serious “possibility” that America would go it alone. 

Putin absolutely [embarrassed America on the world stage with John Kerry's gaffe on saying the only way it could be stopped is if ""Syria agreed to handover chemical weapons immediately"" which Putin seized on.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/10274955/Syria-crisis-America-could-launch-military-strikes-without-Britains-support.html) 


Sorry the UK had fuck all to do with it - Obama was willing to do it without congress approval -  the Obama admin didn't give a fuck about the American people let alone the british government.. It was all Putins doing in seizing on many of John Kerrys gaffes and to portray the UK as any sort of arbiter of peace in that debacle is disingenous.

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"Totally, no disagreement, but what they are referring to when they say ""won't benefit UK"" is that it won't benefit us economically.

The point is that the results of the discovery can't be sold for much profit at all and will only create a limited number of very specialised research jobs in the UK to further develop it.

If you invent and sell a product that *uses* the invention, then you can get a whole load of patents out of it, create masses of skilled and unskilled jobs for manufacture, sales, delivery and supply chain. And the exports improves the balance of payments for the country.

If the Americans or Chinese are the first to create and sell real products using graphene, then they will reap the economic benefits. They will make sales, increase exports and create employment in their countries. If we don't manufacture anything ourselves, then by definition we must import it, then we lose money from our economic cycle and lose employment for our people.

Regarding funding for R&amp;D, I know all the arguments for blue skies research without a specific goal or product in mind. Many huge breakthroughs have come about without any business case for investing in the research. Frequently, the uses and products come much later as an afterthought and have revolutionised the way we live forever.

But let's not be naive. Research costs money and money has to come from somewhere. We as a country are not as wealthy as we used to be. We simply cannot afford to put money into every R&amp;D project out there. Someone has to choose which ones are most likely to benefit us the most in the short and long term.

Government funding is generally more lax about providing a business case and RoI to secure funding but this pool of funds is shrinking year on year with successive governments who don't appreciate the value of R&amp;D.

Private funding is where the real money is at, and they aren't going to inject millions into your research without a bloody good reason and some numbers to convince them. If you want money from a businessman, you're going to have to talk about RoI at some point. It's unavoidable.

&gt; Britain planned to build a **Taliban training camp for 2,000 fighters** in southern Afghanistan, as part of a top-secret deal to make them swap sides...The camp would also have provided **vocational training, including farming and irrigation techniques**, to offer people a viable alternative to growing opium.

&gt; But the Afghan government took issue with **plans to provide military training**, to turn the insurgents into a defence force.
Afghan government staff also claimed the “EU peace-builders” had handed over **mobile phones, laptops and airtime credit** to insurgents. They said the memory stick revealed plans to train the Taliban to use **secure satellite phones**, so they could communicate directly with UK officials.

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/revealed-british-plan-to-build-training-camp-for-taliban-fighters-in-afghanistan-777671.html

&gt; Nato forces mistakenly **supplied food, water and arms to Taliban forces** in southern Afghanistan, officials today admitted.
Containers destined for local police forces were **dropped from a helicopter into a Taliban-controlled area** of Zabul province.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/apr/18/nato.afghanistan

&gt; MI6′s meetings with the Taliban took place **up to half a dozen times** at houses on the outskirts of Lashkah Gah and in villages in the Upper Gereshk valley, to the north-east of Helmand’s main town. The compounds were **surrounded by a force of British infantry** providing a security cordon.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1573687/Britain-in-secret-talks-with-the-Taliban.html

&gt; In August 2007, the presidents of Afghanistan and Tajikistan walked side by side with the U.S. commerce secretary across a new **$37 million concrete bridge** that the Army Corps of Engineers designed to link two of Central Asia’s poorest countries.

&gt; Today, the bridge across the muddy waters of the Panj River is carrying much more than vegetables and timber: It’s **paved the way for drug traffickers to transport larger loads of Afghan heroin and opium** to Central Asia and beyond to Russia and Western Europe.

&gt; The U.S. is investigating allegations that some **officials in the Afghan Air Force, which was established largely with American funds, have been using aircraft to ferry narcotics and illegal weapons** around the country, American officials told The Wall Street Journal.

&gt; The United States has paid more than **$150 million to companies in Afghanistan that are accused of helping to finance terrorist attacks** on American soldiers and facilities, according to the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR). **A list of 43 companies** in Afghanistan was compiled using data from both classified Pentagon investigative reports and Commerce Department lists of terror-connected companies.

If so, find out where your local CID are based (it's no good going to a local police station where no investigating officers are based) and go directly there in office hours (not at 4.55pm - like most people they'll want to be out on time and may look for a reason to put you off until the next day). Ask to speak to a detective sergeant. Show them the full documentation and explain the situation.

The main problems you have at the moment are:

1 - without the full documentation showing that you are the owner of the laptop, there's not really enough to arrest a suspect or get authority to search his home address. He could be invited in for a voluntary interview, but that obviously tips him off and the laptop disappears without a trace. If you can't prove the laptop is yours, then it's down to your word against his, and that will get the case squashed pretty damn quickly. If there's no realistic prospect of getting the suspect or getting your laptop back, they won't assign the resources to investigate it fully. Action Fraud was set up because frauds are getting so common that the police just can't keep up with them, especially online scams - they just don't have the officers, the time or the resources. For a low value (and I know it's high value to you, but sadly people are scammed out of thousands of pounds every single day) fraud, there has to be a lot of evidence to dedicate an officer to investigate - if they investigate yours then someone else's fraud won't be, so yours has to stand out. 

2) PayPal are dicks when it comes to frauds. They know they have the market cornered, so bad customer service isn't overly worrying them. They will drag their heels and cooperate only as much as they absolutely have to; they'll claim banks have to be spoken to first, that they can't proceed without the permission of both account holders and they're mostly talking out of their arses. They're not as bad as Gumtree for this, but they have very little interest in assisting in the investigation.

Alternative solution: get a friend to agree to purchase the laptop, but they'll only pay in cash and want to see it first. On the morning of the transaction, contact the police (not the investigating officer, generic number) and tell them that you're going to retrieve stolen goods and you're worried that violence may occur. That should get them to attend, and you can show all the documentation there &amp; then.

The Suso loan is a great thing. There is no way he would feature much for us this season, and his spell in La Liga should help his development immensely.

As for our loans in, I think that Moses was a good loan on paper and I doubt many managers in BR's place would pass up what seemed like a good opportunity. It is a shame that he hasn't worked out as we all hoped, but I can't say loaning him in was a foreseeable mistake. He just isn't going to have the impact most in the football world thought he was capable of providing. Cissokho is too early to judge IMO. He looks pretty bad going forward, but seems a decent defensive player. I think he is a serviceable squad player for us in a position that we are weak, but I don't see us making that move permanent.

Having huge amounts of cash lying around makes it much easier to invest in very risky businesses.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"I'd really like to see us try something different in regards to Lucas/Gerrard.  They don't work very well together and when they're the two we have sitting deeper in midfield we get shredded.  Gerrard doesn't recover as well as he needs to and Lucas isn't able to cover for him on his own.  Yet we can't really drop either of them.  I think we can build it into our setup to take advantage of their strengths without having to play them side by side and compound their weaknesses.  Allen was good next to Lucas against Everton and we didn't have our midfield passed right through until he was subbed off, give him another go in there.  I wouldn't mind seeing something like this:

-------------------Mignolet-------------------

----------Skrtel--Agger--Sakho----------

Johnson---Lucas--Allen---Flannagan

-----------Gerrard----Coutinho------------

------------------Suarez----------------------

Let Coutinho play high up the pitch, just off of Suarez's shoulder basically.  He's free to roam and move about to create things.  Gerrard sits between him and Lucas/Allen to spring our transitions and attacks as he does so well but his defensive responsibility is much less because he has 2 solid players behind him to sit in there.  Lucas can do what he does best without worrying about what's over his shoulder as Allen is fine cover there and he'll be tidy in possession.  We should be looking to dominate this match and Allen is great for that.  It feels like we're a little light up top with Suarez on his own but Coutinho should be free to really push up the pitch and with Gerrard having a limited responsibility to recover he can make those runs too.  Johnson and Flannagan would be playing quite high up the pitch in the attack as well to bring width to our attacking play.  You could switch Johnson to LWB and play Henderson at RWB as well if you don't think Flannagan is quite up to the task going forward.

Nothing wrong with this, there is a difficult distinction to be made between men of fighting age who may have been paid to fight by the Taliban on the odd occasion and the ""hardcore"" Taliban fighters and commanders who have been fighting for years.  This was intended for the former and was only an idea - it never came to fruition.

&gt; MI6′s meetings with the Taliban took place up to half a dozen times at houses on the outskirts of Lashkah Gah...

All war is political, but counter-insurgency is the most political of all.  How did we make inroads in Northern Ireland? By talking to the enemy and persuading them to develop a legitimate political opposition.  What is wrong with trying this in Afghanistan?

&gt; Today, the bridge across the muddy waters of the Panj River is carrying much more than vegetables and timber: It’s paved the way for drug traffickers to transport larger loads of Afghan heroin and opium to Central Asia and beyond to Russia and Western Europe.

This is inevitable, insurgents rely on the same infrastructure as the population in which they operate.  Anything which benefits the people, will benefit the insurgents.  Also opium poppies are considered a legitimate commodity by many and so are transported like any other commodity.  It's not like we put huge signs on the side of the bridge advertising it as an opium super-highway.

&gt; The U.S. is investigating allegations that some officials in the Afghan Air Force... have been using aircraft to ferry narcotics and illegal weapons...

It is *their* Air Force to be used by the Afghan government.  It is very difficult (arguably impossible) for us to dictate how the government uses its own forces.  Like any instrument of power, it is open to abuse, especially in a culture where it is seen as a senior official’s right to use his department’s resources for his own benefit.

&gt;  The United States has paid more than $150 million to companies in Afghanistan that are accused of helping to finance terrorist attacks on American soldiers and facilities…

This is a very problematic area.  We employ companies to conduct work (typically logistic or infrastructure) and part of the cost is danger money (for want of a better description).  Some companies have discovered that one of the best ways to protect themselves is to pay protection money to insurgents thus funding insurgent activities.  The labyrinthine nature of Afghan society and politics makes this almost impossible to identify or to prevent.  The alternative, avoiding using Afghan companies, will simply undermine the nascent Afghan economy and inflate the market for companies run by non-Afghan nationals.",0,1386175563,null,0,false,0,cdtf2n1,t3_1s2vpk,t1_cdtf2n1,t1_cdte15l,null,1428398701,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

 There are, and that's why I've said it is clear that the current population of eligible pensioners have a disproportionate number of immobile, isolated and poor, so it is cheaper to put this cost-free benefit in place, rather than means-test.

Certainly of the statistics change in the future, it would make sense to change the policy. Bear in mind its only  for people over 74 though, so you'll have to wait a while to smite the baby boomers.

And on that subject, I generally detest the whole 'lets blame a generation for something' trope. It's stupid to decide that millenials are self-entitled slackers and I believe its equally misguided to paint those born in the late 1940s and 50s as a group ""who are causing the whole inflation of property and difficulty for younger people getting on the housing ladder"". 

House price inflation is a systemic problem caused by a shortage of housing stock, the reduction in public housing and  demographic changes whereby more people are living alone.

First Doctor: If you're in for the long haul, you can start with 'An Unearthly Child', the very first episode. It's pretty strange. Other than that, my favourites from Hartnell's era are 'The Daleks' and 'Tenth Planet'. Jesus fucking Christ, those original Cybermen haunt my nightmares

Second Doctor: 'Tomb of the Cybermen'. THE classic Cyberman episode. Creepy as hell. Other than that I haven't seen much of Troughton, but the bits of 'The Moonbase' I saw were brilliant

Third Doctor: 'The Sea Devils'. Probably Pertwee's most (in)famous episode, but 'Inferno' was brilliant as well.

Fourth Doctor: Plenty of choice and a great place to start if Hartnell isn't for you. 'City of Death', 'Genesis of the Daleks', 'The Talons of Weng-Chiang' and 'Pyramids of Mars' stand out as all-time favourites.

Fifth Doctor: 'Caves of Androzani' often pops up at the top of best-episode polls and it really deserves to. Claustrophobic, and a great story. Other than that, there's 'Earthshock' and 'The Five Doctors', the latter of which is the 20th anniversary special.

Sixth Doctor: Starting with Colin Baker might be a mistake. Although he's my favourite doctor, there's a lot that plagued his era: bad scripts, bad production values and the like. However, 'Vengeance on Varos' is genuinely excellent and a pretty good starting point for Six. Then there's the 14-part 'Trial of a Timelord', which is a bit of a mixed bag, and 'The Two Doctors', where Two pops up again.

Anyway, here's the team I *think* will start tonight, although it depends on the actual fitness level of players, which I'm naturally not aware of:

-------------------Kenny

---------Peltier---Zaliukas---Pearce

---Byram--------------------------Pugh

-----------Murphy--------Mowatt

-------------------Austin

---------McCormack-------Smith

Of course, if Lees can play then Byram will probably miss out with Peltier remaining at RWB, while I'd expect Varney to replace McCormack if he can't start (I just won't understand it if Smith doesn't start either way). If it were up to me, Warnock would be playing instead of Pugh, which might still happen, but it would surprise me if McDermott changed it now.

true,ErroneousBee,eng-sussex,West Sussex,"&gt; The attitude of baby boomers is largely disgusting. 

I don't think it is explicitly their attitude, but a sort of collective greed that every generation has, magnified by their extra numbers and the long stay in power for the free market tory government.

I am in my fourties, and I am aware that as I move through life I have only just been lucky enough to grasp the bottom rung of the ladder as the baby boomer dominated electorate pulls it up after themselves.

Aged 16 I was one of the last to do O-Levels as BB parents didn't like to see their kids failing so the coursework oriented GCSE was introduced.

Aged 18 I went to University just as student loans were being phased in. The BB generation wanted all their kids to go to university but couldn't afford to subsidise free education for so many more graduates.

Aged 25 I bought a house just as house prices started to explode. It was an ex-council house as councils were forced to sell off rental stock. The electorate didn't want to subsidise the poor.

Aged 35 I saw final salary pensions going as the last of the BB generation starts entering retirement, so they are not going to fight for rights they already have.

Aged 40 the pension age starts going up, the BB generation are all retired, its not an issue they are going to vote over.

And now the BB generation is voting hard on issues dealing with inheritance, energy and medical care, which I will probably be the last to befit from as the NHS falls apart under the load of keeping a generation now heading towards its 90s on life support.

But the individuals of the BB generation are not all evil grasping capitalists, its the fact they are a large lump voting for their own interests.

Think that one through.. if owed the mortgage company 50k more than my house was worth because its value had plummeted, then it wouldn't matter a damn if the rest of the houses were cheap, because I don't have 50k stashed under my bed, and the mortgage companies will never let me move because they'll never be able to recover that 50k from the sale of my house.

I'm already on a 35 year mortgage, they don't up them any longer than that.. and i'll have to wait for the value of my house to rise, for example, 50k before I break even again.

So you suggestion is that, **as a young person myself** i'll be trapped in a house, unable to move, because I saved and scrimped and lived with at home with parents for well over a year to afford one.

I completely agree that there is something fundamental wrong with the housing market, i just don't see why i should get thrown to the wolves for getting a foot on the ladder.

I also fail to see why building houses at a rate that stops the cost of houses rising is such a bad suggestion.

true,CVI07,null,null,"I started in the same place as you and started in to classic Who just a couple months back.  First and most important thing to know is that almost all of the classic adventures are serialized--that is, what would be a one-hour, one-episode story in the modern series will be 3-5 30 minute episodes in the classic. So the pacing is much slower, more cerebral, a lot less action.

That said, if you're patient, there's a lot of excellent stuff.  I started with what was available on Netflix (US), and made my first classic viewing ""The Aztecs"", a First Doctor story.  And I really enjoyed it!  But as with the modern series, not all classic Who is equal.  Here are my impressions; take them as you will:

Hartnell's doctor is a stern old college professor type most of the time, but has a softer side with a great sense of wonder, often when he's away from his companions.  He tackles conflict with patience and confidence.  He's not quite like any of the modern era Doctors, but all other Doctors have a bit of him in them.

Troughton's Doctor (2) is almost a Lewis Carroll character, marching about with his recorder and approaching his problems with a sense of childlike whimsy.  When things do get serious, he either becomes a raging storm or a panicky, jumpy rabbit.  Matt Smith (11) used a lot of Troughton's work as a model for his Doctor, and it shows.

Pertwee (3) is the *man*.  His run is quite a bit different than others because for most of it he's exiled to Earth with a non-functioning TARDIS.  He runs about with UNIT, drives a groovy buggy, picks up leggy girls and judo-chops aliens in his sweet velvet suit.  His personality is actually quite grave and serious much of the time, with a wry, dry sense of humor slipping through occasionally.  He's the James Bond of the Doctors.

Baker (4) is... I dunno, I have a hard time with Baker.  Maybe he was just built up in my head by seeing so much fan worship, but I find him a bit dull.  He's the furthest from the Doctor mold of the first four, which is fine, but I just don't find his personality all that compelling.  It mostly consists of him being deadpan serious for a while and then there's a slow zoom in on him making a silly face.

5, 6 and 7 I don't have a lot of exposure to.  Working my way through Caves of Androzani now.  5 seems to be a posh playboy type.  He was Tennant's favorite doctor and probably inspired some of 10, which I can see in some of his mannerisms.  6, I haven't seen any of just yet.  I don't hear good things.  7 is pretty great, and harkens back to Hartnell in terms of personality, but seems to have more acid and edge beneath his words and actions.",0,1386181611,null,0,false,0,cdths02,t3_1s2nf3,t1_cdths02,t3_1s2nf3,null,1428397405,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

Then not only that, but we'd be worse off even more because of the global financial crisis further eroding our worse off position.

Having one more of those utility players on the field makes it easy to shift from 4-4-2 to 4-2-3-1 to 4-3-3. I think having more players up field keeps the ball higher up the pitch.

McGann has already proven he can set the hardcore fans ablaze, and the more casual fans will enjoy it as long as it's well-written and does the current Doctor justice.

I can understand and don't mind as much that they would let the other classic Doctors be as they are because they had great runs of their own. But McGann as a Doctor really got the short end of the stick with the TV Movie, so I think he deserves to get another chance to display what he can do with the Doctor on screen.

As for the names of the accents, each one has a unique history (some more well-sourced than others) that is interesting in and of itself.

For example, the fine folks in Liverpool are said to have a [Scouse accent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scouse). The name ""Scouse"" comes from a cheap stew eaten by sailors called lobscouse or labskaus. That word, in turn, is *probably* derived from some Scandinavian word for a similarly-constructed stew (i.e. [lapskaus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapskaus) in Norwegian cuisine - ^which, ^for ^the ^record, ^is ^delicious).

Enjoy the learning, fellow American!

    Flanagan  Agger  Skrtel  Johnson

                Mignolet

So a modern 4‒3‒3 is his choice. Some notable things:

- Henderson will be played as a winger. I don't know if he can support the attack well. I think he will stay back a bit and play as a right midfielder. He will probably provide support for Johnson.
- Coutinho is played in the center. Good.
- Lucas is dropped for Allen. This is one of the few matches where Lucas can be dropped to give him a rest. I hope Allen will do well.
- No Sakho. We have a £15 million beast of a defender, and he's not seeing the grass. I hope he will get game time today.",0,1386185832,null,0,false,0,cdtjrbz,t3_1s3gvu,t1_cdtjrbz,t3_1s3gvu,null,1428396467,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

Now, bear with me a moment...

I know that the children that your family were looking after had been through some horrible things, but surely the first, primary and foremost responsibility of your parents was to you... right?

Your parents did a good thing for a great deal many kids, but it strikes me as pretty negligent to expose you indirectly to the abuse that those foster kids suffered.

Yes you were able to go and get a hug from your parents, but that doesn't really seem the point to me.

true,NotRoryWilliams,null,null,"There is actually a difference. Deranged or demented are factually descriptive terms. They have meaning apart from the derogatory connotation, were historically used as diagnostic/symptomatic descriptions. ""Mental"" lumps together a broad category of people including psychopaths and sociopaths, people exhibiting psychotic or delusional symptoms, people with neurotic issues, people with mood disorders, and of course people who are not actually mentally ill but simply seem odd or foolish. The offensive part is the inappropriate ""lumping"" of the category. 

It's not really a personal problem. Derogatory language and stigma is culturally derived. More broadly, the fact that this sort of language seems to generally be considered okay is problematic and counterproductive. Destigmatizing mental illness is the next major untouched frontier in civil rights. I don't know what country you are in, but it is an enormous and still growing problem in the US. 

If calling people out on language that they themselves do not realize is offensive, is there a better approach that you would suggest?

Although if it came down to two children arguing it was always a case that I should have known better (and that's prob true) so I would normally be punished more harshly (often chores or pocket money withheld).   

We only really had one child who could have physically hurt me and he was clearly told that was one line he could never cross or he was out. And he never did - we had some blazing rows as brother and sister do but he never crossed the line.    
 
With regards to indirectly exposing me to the abuse it would be very hard to monitor that - and I could have left the children when they started talking or called my parents if I had wanted to.   

But I was their big sister (they were normally about 4-7yrs and I was 12-14ish at this time) and I wanted to support them. I was as much of a carer as my parents were.     


After the first time it happened they - on my request - would tell me some of the background. Not details but just ""something bad happened with someone""  - at least I would be prepared and also it gave me a heads up if they started talking then I'd know what it was about. I never knew the full details and I never heard the details back then that was truly awful enough that I would have considered putting my welfare at risk.  

When we first started and I was 7 then I didn't know any of the backgrounds only that we were looking after someone who needed a home and some love. Looking back I'm sure maybe of those girls had suffered abuse but it wasn't anything I was exposed it.

Ripper Street's writing seemed to hit a brick wall with Season 2 as it awkwardly pushed social agenda after social agenda. The more I think about it, the more likely it seems to me that the BBC tied the writers' hands in the commissioning agreement and killed the golden goose.

I'm quite willing to suspend belief as far as the local murder rate is concerned. A while ago I saw a Midsomer Murders where they made a very knowing side-comment about the local murder rate. Made me chuckle.

&gt; Anything carried for the purpose of using it as a weapon is illegal.

http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/l_to_o/offensive_weapons_knives_bladed_and_pointed_articles/#a07

Not a lawyer, but couldn't it be argued that carrying an ""offensive weapon"" to intimidate potential attackers is not the same thing as carrying it with the intention of causing injury someone?  They could also argue that carrying it for self defense is a ""reasonable excuse"".  Not sure how easy either of them would be to prove though...

He’s the same Time Lord, the same being as the Doctors either side of him, but he’s the one who says, ‘I’m not the Doctor.’ So the Eleventh Doctor is still the Eleventh Doctor, the Tenth Doctor is still the Tenth…

&gt;He adds: “Technically, if you really counted it, the David Tennant Doctor is two Doctors, on account of the Meta-Crisis Doctor [in Journey's End]… It’s not a matter of counting the regenerations, but of counting the faces of the Time Lord that calls himself the Doctor. There’s an anomaly Doctor slotted in somewhere, that’s all.

&gt; Defence

The defendant is entitled to be acquitted if he shows on the balance of probabilities that:

    he had ""good reason or lawful authority"" for having the bladed or pointed article; or
    he had the article for use at work; or
    he had the article for religious reasons; or
    he had the article as part of a national costume; (Archbold 24-125).

The defendant does not discharge the burden of showing ""good reason"" just by providing an explanation that is not contradicted by the prosecution evidence: (Archbold 24-128). Where details of a defence are given in interview or in a defence statement, the CPS should consider whether evidence is available to rebut the defence and should liaise with police if additional enquiries or evidence are necessary. Any defence should be tested by robust cross examination. 

there is no leeway as even butter knifes are considered offensive weapons without any context for having it.

true,devaug,null,null,"You're wrong about the Ulster Scots notion only appearing in the 1980's, even American families in California and New Mexico still consider themselves Ulster Scots and they've been there since the 1700's whenever people like Kit Carson and Andrew Jackson were alive, who both had Ulster Scots heritage.

They were all well aware of their ancestry and their descendants still are as well. The strong sense of belonging in the Ulster Scots community in America comes from persecution from the English and the Scottish Highlanders. The stories have been handed down throughout the years and they feel a real closeness with their ancestry, more so than anyone I have ever spoken to here.

13 American Presidents also have strong Ulster Scots heritage as did many of the frontiersmen. In total, about one third of all American Presidents have Ulster Scots ancestry.

I don't blame you for your lack of knowledge, even some people who refer to themselves as Ulster Scots in Northern Ireland have no idea of the history, they just think it's just talking in a Ballymena accent and throwing in a few Gallic sounding words, making sure they don't sound too Irish at the same time.

Source: I studied North American history in University and a huge part of the coursework was interviewing the descendent's of Ulster Scots immigrants in the States, Canada and New Mexico.

On the success ofSinn Fein, it says more about the success of the IRA Terror campaign in Northern Ireland where they bombed the shit clean out of Belfast.

As well as that, majority of Protestants refer to themselves as Unionists, not Loyalists. 

Unionists were not on a bombing campaign or a campaign of terror, there are no Unionist terrorists in Government, but there are plenty of self confessed Republican terrorists currently sitting in the assembly.

Name me one terrorist in the DUP, SDLP or the UUP and I'll name you ten Republican terrorists in Sinn Fein.

On a side note, how come Scotland can go for independence without a bomb going off or a bullet being shot or policemen being murdered and we can't?

If Sinn Fein had offered the people of Northern Ireland safety, security, tax breaks, health care and social justice, instead of an IRA terror campaign, maybe it could have been a United Ireland decades ago.

Once again, just reiterate a very important point which you and many other people seem to miss, THE VAST MAJORITY OF PROTESTANTS REFER TO THEMSELVES AS UNIONISTS, NOT LOYALISTS, and they want nothing to do with terrorism, same goes for the majority of Catholics.

So according to the source posted above Matt is now the 13th regeneration and last Doctor. So what's going to happen next?

In Day of the Doctor we saw the 4th Doctor's face on someone who didn't seem to be the 4th Doctor. But there were many hints that he was a future regeneration of the Doctor. He said the Doctor will start revisiting his favourite faces from the past.

So my thoughts are that the Doctor has no new regenerations. They're all used up. But somehow he is able to regenerate into his old faces. Maybe at random, maybe in order? Maybe the first Doctor we know of is actually the first regeneration!

Maybe Capaldi isn't a new face? Maybe Capaldi is the Doctors original face!? Before he was even called the Doctor. The face he was born with. 

Sorry if any of this conflicts with the old series and makes no sense, I haven't watched it yet. 

The theory sounds good though. It explains regenerations when none are left. Explains Tom is Day of the Doctor. And is slightly more dramatic than the Time Lords giving the Doctor more regenerations.

You could ignore it and not cave to intimidation; switch banks; or just give up for now. Doing only what they allow you to do, is one of the attractions of Bitcoin of course. To your benefit to simply hold BTC for now?.. Obviously others in the UK are being put at a disadvantage by banks troubling the normal market for buying coins.

true,HugoChavezRamboIII,eng-norfolk,Naaaarch,"I have a law degree which I completed 2 years ago. 

...having studied criminal law in my 2nd year (3 years ago), as part of 1 module of 5 which were undertaken that year. Each module included approximately 200 cases (important and mentioned), and each 1hr lecture would have included around 14 cases, though this varied between modules (see: international law). Exploration of what 'reasonable excuse' was for the purposes of S.1 PCA1953 competes in my long-term memory with a host of other cases numbering in their hundreds!

But anyway, you asked for a source and you shall have one!


The relevant case is *Evans v Hughes* [1972] 1 W.L.R. 1452

&gt; LORD WIDGERY C.J.
&gt; 
&gt; The outcome of those authorities, and my own reading of the Act, assisted as it has been by Mr. Worsley's argument, is that it may be a reasonable excuse for the carrying of an offensive weapon that the carrier is in anticipation of *imminent* attack and is carrying it for his own personal defence, but what is abundantly clear to my mind is that *this Act never intended to sanction the permanent or constant carriage of an offensive weapon* merely because of some constant or enduring supposed or actual threat or danger to the carrier. People who are under that kind of continuing threat must protect themselves by other means, notably by enlisting the protection of the police, and in order that it may be a reasonable excuse to say, “I carried this for my own defence,” the threat for which this defence is required must be an imminent particular threat affecting the particular circumstances in which the weapon was carried.

(emphasis added)

In regards to our performance, after Lennon and Lamela switched I hoped it is obvious to AVB that inverted wingers don't work, they are an interesting tactical concept but it doesn't work at spurs. 

Lloris is fantastic.

Chirches is fast becoming our best centre back, i would love to see him and Vertonghen playing together at the back, the prospect of two quick, ball playing, game reading centre backs gives me shivers. On that note when the hell is Rose coming back.

true,Furthur_slimeking,lfc99,,"Well, that was certainly an improvement. I thought Suarez was awful at the weekend, and he's clearly got his head sorted and wanted to make amends. It was an astonishing performance - one of the most dominant I've ever seen.

  The attack as a whole seemed more unified and played with a much better understanding of one another than against Hull. Coutinho was brilliant - I was rooting for him to score - and Sterling, although he didn't exactly set the game on fire, gave a much more inspiring performance than last time. I was really pleased to see him score. I'm not convinced by Henderson in that position. For me, he's a box to box centre mid and nothing else. He didn't have a bad game, though.

  I was pretty impressed with Allen. He did a good job of getting the ball to Coutinho or the wide players and was really unlucky not to score. Gerrard was good, and was also unlucky not to have scored.

 I cannot understand why Sakho hasn't been playing. Yes, Skrtel has been in good form, but Sakho is so solid. I would have rather seen Skrtel and Sakho than Skrtel and Agger. We looked suspect at the back all game. Not having Lucas clearing up in front of the CBs really highlights how many gaps they leave.

 Johnson, I thought was really good today. It was a typical performance from him, really.

 Seeing Alberto get nearly 30 minutes was good. His technique is amazing, and he did nothing wrong at all while was on. Again, he was unlucky not to score. We really need to see more of him - he's a talented lad with the composure, I think, to handle the pressure.

  Suarez was unbelievable tonight, but the team performance was encouraging rather than spectacular. Coutinho, Gerrard, Allen and Johnson all played well. The rest... meh. Let's not forget that it was Norwich we just beat (and lost a soft goal to). At Anfield. 

 I'm impressed with the mentality of the team, though. That, aside from the Luis Suarez Power Hour, was the most pleasing thing about the victory. ",0,1386194877,null,0,false,0,cdto8iy,t3_1s3xc5,t1_cdto8iy,t3_1s3xc5,null,1428394378,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

First half as a team we were pretty mediocre, especially early on. Allen for Lucas left us even more open in the middle, Johnson is still playing poorly and Flanagan isn't quite good enough on the ball.

I thought our best spell was the first 20 minutes of the second half. Coutinho dropped deeper, Henderson tucking in from the left gave us more control. Good mix of possession, forward movement and shifts in pace. We dropped off a bit once Alberto came on as he struggled to get into the game.

Skrtel's basic defending was better today, more pro-active. Some poor passing though. Mignolet's kicking was not good either.

Agger's quality on the ball helps the whole team, but again switches off on crosses. I think he was fouled on the earlier one though.

Sterling did quite well, much better than on sunday.

Coutinho needs to fix his shooting, or shoot less, often they're barely reaching the goal. Yet his throughballs are regularly over-hit.

Allen had a pretty good game but the midfield set up left too many holes when out of possession due to gerrard's wanderings. Going forward gerrard was better than he has been for a while, I wonder if we could play both lucas and allen in the middle and use gerrard in a wider position?",0,1386194961,null,0,false,0,cdto9xm,t3_1s3xc5,t1_cdto9xm,t3_1s3xc5,null,1428394360,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

By this measure I would say that this tweet could qualify; hoping a helicopter crashes into a mosque could be seen as inciting racial violence, and if this guy has a bad track record this could have been the straw to break the camels back. You can't just post whatever shit you like on the internet, I know that most peoples gut reaction is to fight against this as much as possible but wouldn't it be better if people had to take responsibility for what they posted online? Inciting racial hatred and inciting violence are crimes regardless of whether you do it on the internet or in real life. Freedom of speech allows you to say whatever the hell you want, but laws exist to protect individuals/groups of people from violence and harassment and I think that is a good thing.

Insulting people on twitter will not get you arrested, look at all the people who tweet at David Cameron calling him a cunt daily, with 0 repercussions. Because unlike North Korea it is perfectly legal to insult the leader of this country. And for the people calling this a slippery slope I would say that the best answer is reasoned compromise not flat out denial. 

Regulating the internet needs to be a process of sensible compromises.

I like Dempsey but he was never a great fit with what we wanted to do on the pitch.  I'd rather have Gylfi filling the role of player being asked  to play out of position and away from his strength, i think Glyfi puts a better shift in defensively than Dempsey normally did.

Not necessarily. And even so, gun vs gun is better than fist vs knife in my view.

Ingredients vary from batch to batch depending upon what's available at the time - like Lapskaus!  One of the recipes I found called for bacon, which I'd never put in stew before.  Another uses beef, lamb, and pork.  I'm thinking that I'll try beef, lamb, and bacon in my next concoction.  I'm leaving out the one thick slice of rutabaga, however.  Do those things even have a flavor?

I studied Human Geography when I was a college student in the late '70s and early '80s.  I studied it as an undeclared minor, although I think that what I was working on had nothing to do with what you used to teach.  I was exploring the geography of as many humans as I could convince to agree to enjoy the discovery process with me.  Ah, those were wonderful times indeed!

Anyway, back to the subject at hand.  I have to assume that you're a fan of QI or you'd never have seen my cry for help.  I found the show only a little more than a year ago and have seen every episode to be found on YouTube - which I believe to have been all of them at the time.  I'd donate a body part to Science if it would get me on the show just once.  But it would have to be a Super XL show because the panel would have to include Master Fry, Alan, me, and about 6 of the regulars if I'm to be happy with it.  But hey - I donated a body part to Science.  I'm entitled to some indulgences, right?  I'd have to have Jupitus, Locke, Perkins, O'Briain, Noble, and Toksvig.  That would put four panelists on each side of Master Fry.  They'd have to air a 90-minute show with a 2-hour XL version!

So here I am, about to become a British citizen so I can (a) live here without hassles, and (b) get work in the EU if I need to.

Now the UK wants (or is talking about) to leave the EU.

I'm currently looking for permanent work (I was contracting) and I was considering moving the whole family to Scotland because everyone had lots of good things to say about the place. It seems to be much more progressive than England and I'm a firm believer in things like free education. It appeals to me on a very personal level.

So, yes, I have considered moving to Scotland. The independence thing doesn't bother me either way.  I guess if I became a UK citizen, then I can live and work in the EU, so I would still be able to live and work in Scotland if it left the UK.

You CANNOT do this away to the smaller Premier League teams, they WILL fuck you.  Thank God for that penalty or this could have been another fuck up.  I don't mind people making mistakes but not learning from them is infuriating.

This is schoolboy stuff, it drives me insane.  If you're playing the type of football where you keep the ball and have a very patient build up then it's not a problem because you have the numbers and positioning but we're a team that overcommits in attack and leaves numerous scoring opportunities.  

That's not too big of a problem if we're willing to attack until the end of the game, we've had a manager do this before in Keegan and he did it successfully.  But you can't play that football and decide the game is over at 2-0 so take off the player who has put in the biggest shift without changing your style, or at least you can't against a team who will put the crowd behind them.

He's even said himself in his post match interview that he basically just presumed the game was won and was thinking about Saturday.  

There's nothing more in football that pisses me off greater than a team who decide a game is won and stop playing.  It's arrogant and insulting.  We've been doing this for two years now and despite it costing us numerous points in those two years we still haven't learnt our lesson.

The introduction of Holtby at halftime was inspired; not just in terms of Holtby's goal, but also his willingness to meet fulham's midfield stride for stride in workrate; he was everywhere on the pitch in the second half.

Pulling off Sandro for Chadli was a huge gamble 1-0 down, but AVB bet on his team's quality, and the workrate of Holtby and Paulinho in tracking back. This could have gone horribly wrong, but it didn't; It played out well. But I'll say this; 1-0 down to a relegation-zone team, with your CL challenge on the line, just doing the same thing was not the answer. We needed a drastic change &amp; AVB made it.
The other thing the Chadli sub did was force Lennon back to the right wing. Lamela had swapped with him, and Lennon, who'd been our best attacker, was anonymous on the left. Bringing in Chadli, AVB forced Lennon back to the right wing, and that's where the second goal came from.

true,pyxelfish,null,null,"I don't disagree with that point, I'm simply arguing that our society currently places too much emphasis on one's economic contributions, to the devaluation of other measures of worth.

The philosophy to which your above post alludes can roughly be described as Free Market Capitalism, which, like Communism and Socialism, is in principle not a bad way to run a society, all things being equal.

But of course, all things are not equal, people abuse the power given to them, and so systems such as our current one arise wherein markets and governments are twisted and corrupted to form monopolies, oligopolies, plutocracies, and other entrenched concentrations of economic and political power.

The central tenet of free-market capitalism you describe is broken when companies no longer live and die by the merit they offer to society, but are instead propped up by special dispensations and biased legislation. We see this in the way the banks were kept alive at the public's expense when their dishonest sales of bad debt brought them tumbling – these investment banks, by the way, being institutions which provide no value to society at large, avoiding all taxes they possibly can and drastically reducing the rest; they exist only to increase and concentrate their own wealth and power.

Which is why I argue for a way of life that doesn't value money above all things, that does away with it if possible, but instead focusses on providing everyone with a decent quality of life, and allowing them to do whatever it is their heart desires to the benefit of everyone, without a need to worry about what to charge or whether they can live on it.",0,1386201184,null,0,false,0,cdtr18f,t3_1rxh94,t1_cdtr18f,t1_cdsmqfk,null,1428393002,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

 Your best bet is really to be able to run, and not just fast, but far - if you can stay ahead of the pack for a couple of hundred metres the 7 man pack will be spread out behind you, leaving you fewer to deal with at once. If you can stay ahead of them for a mile, you will probably be alone at the end of your run! 

 I learned how to box when I was younger, and have some self defence training. I would still try my very best to leg it from a group of youths.

Short answer is it depends on exit negotiations. If the UK left and went to EFTA then yes we'd be able to work in the EU visa free.

Imo that's most likely to be the case, but its not something we'd know until the very very last second. Its would be the same negotiation tactic as the British Government's current refusal to press for confirmation of whether Scotland can vote 'yes' and be in the EU by the time independence is declared. Probably yes, but nobody will say anything until they absolutely have to.

true,Lit-Up,null,null,"&gt;You're wrong about the Ulster Scots notion only appearing in the 1980's

You didn't read what I wrote. The point was about language. I'm not denying that people have Ulster Scots heritage. I'm saying the dialect of English known as Ulster Scots is not a language in the same way as Gaelic is, it's a dialect of English, and there has only been a movement to pretend that it's a language since the 1980s. But I think you knew that was my point, you've just decided to go off on a tangent.

&gt; I don't blame you for your lack of knowledge, even some people who refer to themselves as Ulster Scots in Northern Ireland have no idea of the history, they just think it's just talking in a Ballymena accent and throwing in a few Gallic sounding words, making sure they don't sound too Irish at the same time.

Are you trying to tell me Ulster Scots is actually a language then?

&gt; On the success ofSinn Fein, it says more about the success of the IRA Terror campaign in Northern Ireland where they bombed the shit clean out of Belfast.

No, it doesn't. When the IRA was active, Sinn Fein's electoral success was very small compared with the nationalist SDLP. They've only soaked up votes since the guns were put down.

&gt;As well as that, majority of Protestants refer to themselves as Unionists, not Loyalists.

I was responding to the terms used by the OP in the title. He said loyalist.

&gt;Unionists were not on a bombing campaign or a campaign of terror,

[Um.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_and_Monaghan_bombings)

&gt;Name me one terrorist in the DUP, SDLP or the UUP and I'll name you ten Republican terrorists in Sinn Fein.

I don't think the word ""terrorist"" is any more useful than ""bogeyman"" in a critical discussion. 

&gt;On a side note, how come Scotland can go for independence without a bomb going off or a bullet being shot or policemen being murdered and we can't?

I don't see how any of this is relevant to the original post, nor my response. It's also nonsensical to be comparing Scotland of 2013 to Northern Ireland of the 1960s. ",0,1386201893,null,0,false,0,cdtrbyl,t3_1s16at,t1_cdtrbyl,t1_cdtn6f9,null,1428392863,4,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,4

Okay so this is just from the top of my head and obviously when I suggest these I'm assuming a situation similar to before he called his friends, a group of young men your best bet is to have a phone, call the police and run like fuck - 

Sub 3"" non-locking knife, legal to carry but can be suspicious at certain times i.e. don't go out clubbing with it etc. A nice route around the non-locking is a friction folder (google new zealand peasant knife). A small knife like this if used to defend oneself **when there is no other option** would need to be used ""aggressively"".

""Tactical"" pens - Same as above really but you're more likely to get away with carrying a nice parker ball point and they're quite inconspicuous.

Kubotan - Just don't bother, they don't cause enough damage. If so inclined get a flat ended one as I expect the more blunt force you can use the better, the pointed ones are worse.

Very bright torch - bit awkward to use but there have been people who speculate that using a bright torch (200 lumens +) is enough to disorientate someone enough for you to land a few crucial blows. The main downside to this is that you have to think to do it and when panicked it can be hard for some.

Knuckle dusters - Just downright illegal to carry and own (section 5 prohibited weapon I believe), you can't even have one in your house unless it is a collectable / historic piece. But and this is a big but, someone with 9+ months boxing under their belt and a couple or iron knuckles is a force to be reckoned with, however the penalty if caught is not good.

Another risky route is to carry something you're not allowed but have a good reason for having it. (I'm sure you can use your imagination)

Home made pepper sprays could be good, capsiconic acid is very soluble in alcohols. It is a very good concentrated condiment for taking to your friends house to make a batch of chilli vodka.

At some point he slipped off to a nice quiet universe that already had its own Doctor, allowing him to truly rest and retire, knowing someone he trusts is on the case. And he becomes a curator of a gallery containing enough lovely exotic pieces to give him plenty of nostalgia, including a certain piece that he acquired under extraordinary circumstances, as a little bit of a helpful push for his alternate self.

I'm not saying that there are no barriers to entry. There indeed are. Juniors are often brought in, as part of a renewal process, some stay and some go elsewhere. Is this always at the expense of older employees? Invariably not. You can't honestly expect an intern or someone with 1 or 2 years experience to be handling a multi-national / global account which requires years of acquired experience. No one is going to give that sort of responsibility out of the gate. FTSE 100 or not. It won't happen.

Once again, I don't think you grasp this. If someone **really** wants to do something, they will find a way. You can imagine all sorts of obstacles as to why something is not possible. And if that's how you see the world, then that's fine. It suits your temperament, risk or self-belief profile. So that may be a fairytale from your perspective. There are many who have made this and continue to make this a reality. And as more people continue to work past the age of retirement, many are engaging in new careers.

I do agree with you, that for many, they'll just plod along and accept things as they are. That doesn't mean they can't change. How old are you by the way?

5th goal-Suarez  

*Sterling was last to touch it before LS, but it was an almost accidental one-touch. Flano put it in motion toward Sterling. I'd count Flano before Sterling with an assist.  

**On a free kick that gets converted, does the person who drew the free kick get credit for the assist? Wikipedia is ambiguous about it; there doesn't seem to be an official rule. If drawing a foul counts, then Hendo gets an assist.  
The difficult thing is that an assist doesn't have an established definition. If Migs passed to Suarez, who ran 95 yards, beating every player individually and then scored, I wouldn't give Migs an assist because he didn't really create a chance- that was all on Suarez.  
At the same time. If Studge took a great shot that was miraculously blocked, and then Suarez shot the rebound in, I wouldn't give Studge an assist.   To me an assist is a pass that is intended to lead to a shot. Not a missed shot that leads to an opportunity nor a pass that leads to a great individual performance.  
For this reason, I don't know if Gerrard deserves an assist on the first goal, because that was just LS taking a bold shot, and I don't know if Sterling deserves an assist because he was in the right place at the right time. He clearly wasn't trying to set up a goal, it just happened because of LS.  
The only obvious assists in the game for me were Cou-Suarez on the corner, and LS to Sterling on the cross.

true,spiffing_,eng-GreaterLondon,Croydon't,"I dont fail to grasp things, it's reality. How can someone find a will or a way to train for a position as a doctor with the obstacles in the way of society? It's being naively optimistic. At my college we had a teacher who repetitively told us that if you don't make it before you're 30, the odds say you never will. His words echo in my mind because it is all I have seen in my career. I have worked with people over 30 who are on low grade salaries struggling to differentiate themselves from people half their age and progress. Within my career spanning two brand companies, the only people over 40 I have seen hired have been solely because of share ownership or competitor experience. I work in the financial sector so I speak for a niche but it is the same everywhere. My father became an electrician at 44 but is never contracted before apprentices half his age. Older people are generally thought of as asking for a higher wage. I have a friend working at an NHS pct, that I too once went to an interview for, and sadly the healthcare professions are hiring younger to cut band pay and hiring current staff associates all the time, everywhere.

This isn't the 'American dream' anymore. In a world where we seemingly have any opportunity gifted to us, the reality is that the support network doesn't exist as the gap on classes changes. Doctors and dentist training requires all A* exam results and £45k worth of tuition, even then applicants are fighting each other off with overseas students battling for places with priority due to their higher costs. The concept of 'if you put your mind to anything you can achieve it' is just a theory. The country's unemployment figures for older people only credit it. And I'm probably a lot younger than you think, but I have seen it all. My sister is also a hr manager.

You're not legally entitled to carry anything on you with the intent of using it in self defence. The only thing you'd probably get away with is a set of keys in between your fingers. 

The best way to avoid conflict is not to get involved in it. Use situational awareness to give you an idea of what is going on around you. Don't walk down deserted streets in bad areas at night, notice when people are following you, etc. Common sense comes into play when dealing with people and knowing when to get out of a situation. Don't give it a chance to escalate to anything serious. Of course you can't plan for everything but knowing behavioural cues and how to manage conflict goes a long way.

Self defence classes will give you a lot of information about how much force you are legally allowed to use and some limited techniques to minimise harm in serious situations.

true,rockstarsheep,eng-Oxfordshire,London,"We agree to disagree at least. You do make some fair points, and I will not deny that. 

Once again, you speak of your idea of reality and that's absolutely fine. I'm not having a go at you. I think you can at least concede that different people have different perspectives, that is to say, perspectives which are other to yours, based off of their knowledge and experience. And, I will also add, not including myself here, because I am not that arrogant, that these others may conceivably know more than you, having lived longer than you. Conversely there will be those, with longer life and experience, who'll know a heck of a lot less than you. I'm looking to be reasonable here. 

The ""American Dream"" as you make mention of, well, that idea is a little late in the day. Just how you define that, well, I don't know. Nevertheless, over time, and this is clearly evidenced, there have been individuals, who through great determination, have made their way in to another career. There have also been those who made the attempt and failed. Yet, there are those who succeed. 

You might say that everything is indeed a theory, from what you're painting as your perspective. Yet, I can't reasonably say that's your perspective with what little I know of you and your thoughts. I'm not seeking to play devil's advocate or be contrarian for the sake of doing so in order to rile, irritate or otherwise annoy and perhaps even insult you. 

Competition may be tough, but that's never been a bad thing. It weeds out those who want to commit and dedicate themselves to a vocation and those who're just on a cruise. The same sort of determination is needed to be an entrepreneur or to have a hope of success in anything. There are no guarantees. To claim that something is absolutely not possible, is to paint the world in black and white. This is simply not true. 

I do wonder, and you make take umbrage from this, however, I must question your teacher at college - did he ""make it"" or not?

They are pretty cheap and always useful to carry around, but having one of these in my jacket pocket or, for women I would assume in your handbag, gives a comforting sense of security because it is always something you can have in your hand if you are forced to confront an attacker.

While this may not be very useful for a gang of seven men, if it was a single attacker, a slash across the face or a stab to the eyes or throat may give you a few moments head start to make your escape (and if you can get a good shot in the eye it may incapacitate them to a certain extent). Plus they are small enough so that they will not cause any sort of real/lethal damage that could get you in a lot of trouble with the Police, even if it is in self defence.

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; I was one of the last to do O-Levels as BB parents didn't like to see their kids failing so the coursework oriented GCSE was introduced.

Meh, I'm not sure that that's the reason GCSE's were introduced - I'm sure GCSEs had wide-ranging support from teachers.

At the time I was in public school, only about 5% of the population got to attend university, and all of us were pretty much guaranteed a place. I'm pretty sure our teachers welcomed GCSEs because it gave students a better chance to show what they were capable of. 

To a certain extent, exams asses the student's ability to pass exams. If we can find a way to asses their other abilities, that's all to the good.

I don't really see your point in regards the generational battle of O levels vs GCSEs - no-one is disadvantaged by taking GCSEs instead of O-levels. You are not valued over your colleague who happens to be a year younger than you, who has GCSEs instead of your O-levels.

&gt; It was an ex-council house as councils were forced to sell off rental stock. The electorate didn't want to subsidise the poor.

This is a bit of a mischaracterisation.

It wasn't a matter of ""subsidising the poor"" - Thatcher was a neo-liberal and (although she admittedly didn't believe in subsidising the poor, either) the privatisation was driven by the belief that councils had no place in building homes. 

Hers was a capitalist belief that state bureaucracy (like the then still existent USSR) is inherently slow, lumbering and bureaucratic, and that ""agile"" capitalism can solve all problems on a survival-of-the-fittest basis.

Really, I think very few of the public gave the council house sell-off a deep political examination.
Residents were given a discount because they'd been paying rent on their properties for years - that was seen as ""fair"". One's council house was one's home - residents had been living in them for years; it was seen as fair that one should be able to own one's home.

That councils were forbidden from reinvesting the proceeds of the sell-off into replacement building - I doubt that was on many people's radar. 

It was all part of the booming profiteering 80's, when everything was going so well. Who gave it much thought?

Council house owners were happy to reap the proceeds of the sell-off - owning a house for cheap, selling it and moving somewhere nicer. The state effectively gave them a big wad of cash. The construction industry was happy to build nicer homes for these folks to buy with their proceeds of their housing boom. I have no doubt that the Bank Of England printed money as mortgages were loaned to new home-owners.

I think you're totally right that this is blind generational selfishness, but I disagree with these details. ",0,1386213552,null,0,false,0,cdtwecb,t3_1s2h8o,t1_cdtwecb,t1_cdtgo36,null,1428390499,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4
