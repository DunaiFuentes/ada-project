Some highlights from a few years ago from my time at a UL college:

Managing to get alcohol banned at sporting dinners as the Isoc wanted to attend (despite not being a sports team). 

Trying to get the entire uni to be segregated on gender lines (they didn't manage that - but it didn't stop them from trying). I.e. speeches, fliers, protests, petitions.

Every so often they would wander around in big groups around the student union handing out inflammatory fliers which they would leave on tables and intimidate people into taking (women are evil, booze is evil, sharia is awesome etc).

Insisting on their own prayer room, despite a 'multi faith' space being available. They managed to get their own way with that, at a huge cost to the university.

true,guernican,null,null,"Well, there are a few points here I'm going to take issue with. 

Firstly, a few hundred (or even thousand) billionaires buying homes in Kensington, Chelsea and Hampstead does not skew property prices. It's a ridiculous idea that would only make sense if they were buying vast swathes of property in Clapham, Walthamstow, Lewisham and New Cross. The super-rich - the sorts of people that that floppy-haired prick some of you voted into the mayorship is so keen to have here - have an absolutely minimal effect on you buying a house (or not). 

Secondly, low pay. Yes, pay for some jobs is appalling: this is true. Demeaning is an emotively-charged word that doesn't particularly help the debate, though. What do you find demeaning? Something that doesn't fit the skills you've worked hard to develop, or something you don't particularly like the idea of? 

Thirdly, the idea of companies ""struggling to full jobs"". My impression is quite to the contrary: there are not enough jobs for too many people. Companies continue to cut budgets, and therefore resources. Skilled people - people with good degrees and experience - can struggle to find work, let alone new graduates or young people with minimal qualifications and skills. 

So what are we left with? Something you would find ""demeaning"", no doubt. Well, that's a subjective viewpoint. Speaking personally, if I need work to feed my family and pay for my house, I'd have to go quite far to find something demeaning. On the whole, I tend to agree with the graduate student who didn't want to stack shelves at Poundland. But not because it was beneath her; because she wasn't getting paid for it. Work's not always easy to come by. But it's a necessary fact of life, and when you have a responsibility to support people, saying ""that's demeaning"" leaves me feeling minimal sympathy for you. Do what you have to to feed your family. In the meantime, by all means find something else that's commensurate with your skills, or your expertise, or your qualifications. But to sit back, say ""there's nothing I'm willing to do"" and blame someone else for it... frankly, you can whistle for my sympathy.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Firstly, a few hundred (or even thousand) billionaires buying homes in Kensington, Chelsea and Hampstead does not skew property prices.

It literally does. You can haggle over the amount skewed if you want. It's not just a few houses here or there. Was the olympic village, despite being built with public funds, given over to help Londoners or was it sold to the Qatari royal family?

&gt; Demeaning is an emotively-charged word that doesn't particularly help the debate, though.

It is perfectly acceptable. Demeaning could be 40hr work weeks, travel distance, or something boring, mundane, and depressing. You are also thinking selfishly. Jobs can be demeaning to society not just the individual. Scabs would be one example that is demeaning in such a way. New immigrants willing to work in bad conditions undercuts safety conditions for all. Demeaning could be a socio-economic system that doesn't value child rearing as labour, so we force woman (or men) into the ""real"" economy.

&gt; My impression is quite to the contrary: there are not enough jobs for too many people. Companies continue to cut budgets, and therefore resources. Skilled people - people with good degrees and experience - can struggle to find work, let alone new graduates or young people with minimal qualifications and skills.

I would objectively call this demeaning. There's also nothing stopping these phenomena happening at the same time. You seem to be forgetting the 70s where Britain collectively said enough to bad working conditions, much like America. What happened? The slave labour conditions shifted east and poor immigrants were brought in from the colonies. I haven't the stats at hand, but I know for a fact that this is still happening in Europe today. Amazon made the news recently for example.

&gt; Well, that's a subjective viewpoint. 

It isn't. Slavery can be reintroduced then because it is ""subjective"". Many slaves with ""good"" owners were content.

&gt; But to sit back, say ""there's nothing I'm willing to do"" and blame someone else for it... frankly, you can whistle for my sympathy.

I do get pretty irritated when I see motorcyclists in the bike box, particularly on a busy commute where there's not much space in there.

I also quite frequently notice motorbikes &amp; scooters overtaking/filtering on the left-side of the traffic (so between the traffic and bike lane), which I always think is quite dangerous as one cyclist might pop out of their lane to overtake another. A few times I've even noticed a mass migration of motorbikes from this side of traffic, only to spot a police van parked further down the road - so clearly these motorcyclists do know they're doing something wrong!

This really *really* bugs the crap out of me.  I'm capable of comparing £x per 150g vs £y per 125g or whatever given a few seconds to do some mental arithmetic or fire up my phone's calculator app, but when I've got a week's shopping to do for six people on a tight budget I could do without having to do it for every single offer.  What's the fucking point of 'comparison' prices if you can't fucking compare them to each other?

true,guernican,null,null,"Fair point, perhaps I am projecting frustration on you. Accept my apologies: I'm not accusing you of being unwilling to work. 

But I stand by my points. Your argument about the Olympic Village is spurious. What would ""given to Londoners"" entail? Presumably someone has to pay for the conversion of what are effectively university halls of residence into actual, self-contained homes. What percentage of these turn out to be affordable is another point, and one that hasn't yet come to light. I suspect, and I'm sure you do too, that the number of genuinely affordable homes will be far lower than Johnson originally implied. 

As it's a local council, though, there's no apparent reason why the government would spend national money on a local housing development. The council chose to sell it to an overseas company who will, no doubt, make a lot of money out of it. It may be ""wrong"", it may be that we'd rather they were given wholesale to the public, it may be that we'd rather a British property developer had bought them, or whatever. But the Olympic Village, large development though it is, is still just a few hundred homes. And Roman Abramovich knocking 4 flats through at number 1 Park Lane to make a megapad has no effect on property prices in Walthamstow. It's a silly thing to say. 

Demeaning... you miss my point entirely. I've no idea what you mean about scabs, unless you're referring to union workers breaking strikes, but the reality of the situation doesn't match your view of it. 40-hour weeks? How many hours a week do you work? I work at least that and I don't find it demeaning... I count myself fucking lucky to be able to afford a mortgage. 

Your point of view sounds like a throwback to the 70s, which I do remember perfectly well. I've voted Labour all my life, but even I remember the choked productivity of a society in thrall to trade unions. The fact that Thatcher and her bastard offspring had to virtually destroy this country's manufacturing base to break them doesn't change the fact that Britain was vastly uncompetitive. 

Your point about people willing to work in safety conditions that ""British"" workers wouldn't tolerate may be a fair one: I don't have any figures to make a decision on that. And, I guess, neither do you. The problem we have with this argument is your romanticised view of what life should be like. On the one hand, you blame immigrants for taking jobs that British people aren't willing to do, or for working in conditions that the British wouldn't tolerate. On the other, you're completely disregarding the fact that we have a government populated almost exclusively by privileged, privately-educated men that couldn't give two shits about your daydreams of unionised conditions and the 30-hour working week. Not to mention the vital importance of big business to their vision of economic recovery: the very big businesses you mention in passing, or that we frequently see in the finance pages telling HMRC to go and fuck themselves.

The people who bought their large council houses for 30% of market value would have been relatively poor but capital rich (in the form of their house) so when the housing market boomed they could retire in comfort away from London so it makes perfect sense. Also note if white people were moving away and non-white people moving in it means that they were selling their homes to non-white people indicating they were happy for non-white people to move in. 

I think the main thing people should remember is that non-white immigration is a relatively new thing in Britain, it started in around the 1960s and so regional trends which are happening now may be impacted by events which started when there were few if any non-white people in those areas.

In the UK we're told not to do that because it's racist. And will lead to race relations problems. However in say Taiwan everyone does it and it doesn't lead to race relations problems because they haven't let in tonnes of people who are visibly different. They've let in a few, but they can only stay if they can support themselves. They're don't let in refugees. They immediately deport people who break immigration rules. In the UK people caught in the country illegally can claim asylum and then just abscond if they get turned down and fail to appeal. Really the UK system is run for the benefit of lawyers who get legal aid cash for all those appeals and tribunals. It's not for the benefit of the majority of the population.

So it seems to me that in the UK we're all expected to not mention race because the people in charge have let in a load of visibly different people who can't integrate. In Taiwan the people in charge have done their jobs and there is no large group of visibly different people who have failed to integrate. So people can call a spade a spade.

Yes, treat it like a 9-5. Do properly good covering letters. Go through the person specification and job listing, copy every requirement that the listing has into a blank document. Answer every single one of those requirements. When you've got something written for every bullet point delete out the stuff from the posting then you have an application.  
  
When in doubt, just assume the person doing the hiring is stupid and cant ""read between the lines"" and use any sort of judgement whatsoever. They need hard evidence that you meet every single requirement. So they wont be able to see that you've got transferable skills unless you explicitly tell them that you have. Remember to use keywords. ""IT"" ""Windows"" etc.

Netflix has ""Classic Doctor Who"" and ""Doctor Who"" as separate entries in their library. As an American, I can tell you that Americans call the *entire run* of a show from start to finish a 'series'. Thus, through Netflix, it is possible that the author's instant queue (list of shows to watch, basically, if you're unfamiliar with Netflix), looks like this:

1. LOST
2. It's Always Sunny In Philedelphia
3. Firefly
4. Doctor Who
5. Classic Doctor Who
6. Arrested Development

Given an American naming convention, 1-3 and 6 are full series'. Doctor Who is different given that it is not American.

In such a circumstance the Commons could vote to disband Parliament permanently, and make their leader a lifetime tyrannical dictator, against the wishes of the vast majority of the public, pushing it through the Lords using the Parliament Act. Then the Crown, currently inhabited by the Monarchy, is the last defence. In practice she would likely need the support of the army.

Far from it, it is a nuance. Do you think I'm talking from baseless logic? Nay, try empiricism:

&gt; &gt; Estate agents have recently reported a dramatic rise in the number of wealthy overseas buyers looking to invest in London property. Liam Bailey, Knight Frank’s head of residential research said: **“The property boom in prime central London is being driven by overseas buyers. More than 60 per cent of all sales above £2m are currently going to overseas purchasers.”**

&gt; I work at least that and I don't find it demeaning... I count myself fucking lucky to be able to afford a mortgage.

I find the mortgage system demeaning, and it taken objectively anything feeding the finance sector is part of the problem of economic instability.

&gt; I've voted Labour all my life, but even I remember the choked productivity of a society in thrall to trade unions.

I have only ever spoiled my ballot or voted Pirate Party recently, just for the hell of it. The political system does not represent me and Labour is a misnomer—I've never fallen for brand politics. What you seem to be failing to see is that I'm approaching the issue academically, without prejudice. We've seen 100+ years where the collective has pushed back against abusive socio-economic relationships that they found demeaning. It's an uncontentious historical trend and established economic theory that from a high level ""job creators"" manipulate the labour market. Hell, treating people like discreet units of economic ""value"" should be seen as demeaning. Essentially that is what a ""job"" is, and a ""job"" is something very different that work. Many ""jobs"" involve no meaningful work but they are remunerated extravagantly, whilst very important work like equipping the next generation with the skills and knowledge to be happy and successful, being able to reach true potential, is peripheralized.

&gt; So where does that leave you, or me? Out of work on principle?

It leaves us accepting a race to the bottom, or alternatively seeking something different. Something else to think about besides selfish commercial gain: every smart imported doctor on the NHS is a skill taken away from emerging nations. First of all it is a wallpapering over of the flawed home educational model, and undermining the intellectual capacity for the foreign country who probably needs in the most. I haven't just been talking about factory scrubbers, but yes them too. A doctor from India has a higher chance of being happier with 30k, where a UK applicant might expect 40k, to give a crude but legitimate hypothetical. That is 10k possibly taken out of the local economy, lower tax revenue, etc, etc. Do you now understand how demeaning is very nuanced and can be more objective than subjective?",0,1361357755,null,0,false,0,c8ie89b,t3_18v770,t1_c8ie89b,t1_c8ie29r,null,1431349663,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Almost everyone, I'm sure, except - perhaps - the doctors concerned. Presumably we wouldn't even be arguing about it if the prospect of earning that extra money wasn't so appealing. We're not talking here about utopia, we're talking about human nature. 

But to try to have a serious conversation about living standards and financial models with Tyler Durden is starting to feel a little pointless. The first steps towards change are to try to empower the most progressive elements of the existing system, not to spoil your ballot paper and spout outrage about how the system is broken. 

""More than 60 per cent of all sales above £2m are currently going to overseas purchasers.”

Mmmm. I think you've just proved my point, as well as reminding me of another one. The super-wealthy - and it really doesn't matter whether they're Qatari, German, Martian or English - have always sunk money into London property to safeguard it, for the very simple reason that it doesn't depreciate. This is neither a new phenomenon, nor does it have any bearing on your argument. The quote you chose qualifies its premises on the word ""prime"". I don't buy ""prime"" real estate, and neither do 99.5% of this country's population. And, as I've said before, rising house prices in Chelsea don't impact on the availability of a 3-bedroom in Tottenham. 

By the way, you're welcome to your opinion of the mortgage system, but it's far preferable by any reasonable assessment of its merits to the idea of paying thousands of pounds a month, in pepetuity, to a relatively small class of large-scale property owners in rent. To dismiss it for ""feeding the finance sector"" is an argument that could apply to absolutely any of the interactions any person has in any given day, from using a debit card to writing a cheque. I assume you do, occasionally, succumb to one of those. 

I'm interested to hear what you perceive as the results of this century of collective affirmative action. We don't send children up chimneys or down coalmines any more, true, although there are plenty of countries willing to allow them to do the equivalent for Apple, Microsoft, Sony and others. We also have a wage gap higher than at any time since the 17th century. I lend no more credence to the argument that people like Romney, to take an example, are creators of wealth for others, any more than you presumably do.

If we are to get out of the mire of spending that the Labour government got us into then we must let go of impractical Keynesianism and cut down spending, ""roll back the frontiers of the state"". We are no longer in an economic situation that can support a large state, privatizing some areas of government does not just reduce our exponential spending but creates a free market ripe for competition and as such a better outcome for the consumer.

I agree that private companies can be totally reckless and inconsiderate with regard to the people whose interests they are meant to preserve but this is only true when regulation is bad or messy. Under Labour there was a constant stream of new legislation whenever there was a new issue, going back and assessing old regulation was not on the agenda, it was a lazy solution. As such the companies can work around the mazes and fuck with people. Less regulation, but better regulation can stop this happening to such an extent. Then we can have a system that encompasses the brilliant beneftis of a free market, that does not make the state spend over its means but also protects the most important thing about a country, its people.

That said, there probably is also an element of 'white flight'. However I think that it is important to separate race and culture. It just so happens that certain cultures are dominated by people of particular races, and thus the two are confused. 


Fundamentally, people of all races are the same. It is the cultures that are different, and often completely incompatible. I would imagine that the average white person would have more in common with someone of Asian origin born in this country of no religious affiliation than with a white muslim. 


So, it is the cultures that are often incompatible, and feel 'foreign'. I am inclined to think that there are aspects of other cultures that can be assimilated into our own - this is of course what we have been doing for centuries.

There are of course various interpretations on the fig tree episode (many believe it represents Israel, and Jesus disappointment with their receiving him as their messiah).

But on a practical level, the scholar F. F. Bruce goes into some details about the nature of fig trees and their fruit. Apparently before the 'time for figs' they put out these little 'seedling' things that are edible. This is why Jesus was approaching the tree for figs, even though it wasn't yet the time for figs. These seedling things (little pods or whatever) are a signal that this tree will be bearing fruit when the season comes around. 

As the tree didn't have them, it indicated it would not be bearing fruit. Because of it's unfruitful nature, Jesus condemns it.

As for the point of the whole thing, you could go for all sorts; Israel is the tree and is unfruitful, Jesus is illustrating the power of faith and words, etc. It's interesting that it's immediately followed by Jesus going straight into Jerusalem and turning over the tables etc.",0,1361360858,null,0,false,0,c8iej3n,t3_18unnk,t1_c8iej3n,t1_c8iedk5,null,1431349804,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Spending plays a huge part into why I hold this opinion as well, it's countless how many ex police officials come out after the tenure to say that they'd save fuck loads of money if it wasn't for the technology used to catch petty dealers, the time and effort they spend on raids and the cost of incarcerating those who are caught only to free them the next day. Legalize it and the cost goes. With the NHS people only really go in with weed problems when they've smoked bad stuff, with glass in and the like. Legalize it and we get good quality weed, thats grown in the UK, making us a fuck tonne of money, and we tax it, making loads of money and the buyer gets good stuff. What's not to love. If its sold legally then the money is, quite significantly, taken out of the hands of the dealer and put back into the hands of the people.

So you're saying that legalising it won't change much, if it's not working now anyway? I strongly disagree. If weed is legalised and the marketing companies join the game, then everyone will be smoking it within a few months. It's a new toy, it's supposedly not any worse than cigarettes and it makes you high.

I don't understand how this is relevant. The fact I don't speak to my white neighbours because I'm too busy watching x-factor has absolutely nothing to do with immigration. People can and do still care for each other. But white British people turned their back on their own culture in exchange for shit TV and shit diets. You can still relate to each other and care for each other, regardless of your different backgrounds. But white British people in some areas almost completely rejected this part of our culture at some point in the last few decades.

With a Nigerian or Polish person, you could probably share a passion for a sport, or music, or food. You could share a place where you live. You might live on the same road. You might enjoy the same TV programs or books. You might share a beer together. You might share a mutual hatred for TfL. Perhaps you both like poetry? You would share a culture. The culture of London. A city where people have flocked to for millenia. You could share a welcome with the latest round of entrants.

I just can't help but see some very negative attitudes in this thread. I'm not saying yours is, but I just don't see why people feel like they can't get along with other people simply because they don't have 2 parents from the same country. It's really quite depressing. I know there are deprived areas, and these deprived areas are where problems like this can come to a head and that's totally understandable. In deprived areas everything is magnified. But am I supposed to walk around Waitrose, look at all the black and asian British people in there, their kids all wearing Man Utd and Chelsea shirts, or go to the pub and and see asian and black british people in there drinking along side me and my mates, and I'm to think that these ethnic minorities are invading our white area? That this area cannot be considered British anymore, because there are too many ethnic minorities here? That just feels totally wrong to me.

And if that's not the sort of thing we're talking about, then we need to be very careful not to create rifts in our communities. Because I don't think it's fair to lump all ethnic minorities into one basket.

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"&gt; Curiously I think many historical biblical scholars conclude that if not Jesus then some other figurehead would have been used in his stead: Simon of Getta, Simon Magus for example. JC was really one bloke amongst many who were in the right place at the right time.

this seems to be quite a weak position with a backwards looking approach; ie. it seems to assume christianity was 'invented' *after* Jesus rather than initiated by him, and some kind of council or group decided things like 'who should be the figurehead of our new religion'. That seems to contradict all the historical evidence as far as I see it. 

For example, who are these other figures comparable to Jesus? Simon Magus was a sorcerer who converted to Christianity, it seems strange to assume he was really just another 'Jesus like' character. 

&gt; On the other hand Christianity would certainly have gone the same way as say Mithraism if it were not for the relentless balls-to-the-wall prothlesizing of Paul

well certainly without a group of people, including those like Paul, who were so balls-to-the-wall. But there were Christians before Paul, and quite a few of them. He played a significant part, but I don't think the whole thing hangs on him. Rather I'd apply your first principle to Paul; if it wasn't Paul then someone else would have stepped up to proselytize as he did.

It's a good principle but the danger to life is a different category to if we are harming ourselves. With guns we give others the means to harm us. Yes we can be stabbed but guns make it easier. I love that in America people can fend off bears and thieves and whatnot but there will always be Columbines and Virginia Techs if they are there. There is also that as well as being better armed to defend ourselves, the attacker will be better armed in turn, what is to be gained from entering into an arms race.

Once we give guns to the people then there is no taking them back. If we give them out, the criminals acquire them then we do as the people. If the government takes them back then we hand them over and the criminals...don't. Something we would always pay the price for. Even the most ardent Yankee gun hater must accept that.

So in principle i agree with guns for the people but as a realist I think it would be foolish.

true,RabidRaccoon,cnty-expat,Expat,"&gt; Isn't Taiwan run by the Chinese government? Famed for their human rights record?

Arguably yes, but not in the way you presumably intended.

The Republic Of China aka Taiwan government is famed for its human rights record amongst Chinese people.  Up to the 1970's it was recognized as the One True China but since the 1970's the PRC has taken over that role, cheered on by the left. The PRC however has a terrible human rights record. Most Taiwanese people would rather Taiwan be called the Republic of Taiwan and separate legally from China, but the PRC has threatened to invade if that ever happened. So the Taiwanese government still calls itself the ROC, and still claims to be the One True Chinese government. Sooner or later the PRC will liberalise and then Taiwan will become independent. Though it might well keep the ROC moniker for complex internal political reasons.

So your statement was technically correct but it actually means the opposite of what you intended. Congratulations.

&gt; See, a bigot in the UK would say that ""yellow people"" all look the same. 

Well they'd be dead wrong. But I think they should still be allowed to say it. However people like me would explain ad nauseam to them why they are wrong.

&gt; Your final implication is somehow that ""foreigners"" are more stupid and dishonest than the Taiwanese (and obviously you, the white man)? I find that abhorrent. And a bit silly.

Well yeah. And like in the case of someone in the UK saying it I'd explain that there's a lot of difference between British, German and Swedish people. So it doesn't make any sense to bin them together and make statements about 百人 or ""Europeans"". Still people have a right to say things that are silly and or abhorrent. And I have a right to object to them based on my superior experience.

1. If you go for the practical answer, Jesus just cursing something for no real obvious reason (i.e. taking out his frustrations on innocent vegetation) just seems completely out of character with anything else he ever does.  This is a guy who managed 40 days in the desert being tempted by Satan himself, and allowed himself to be led to his own death, without uttering a single word of aggression towards the perpetrators of his downfall, and yet he curses a poor tree for no fault of its own.

2. The Israel explanation seems wildly speculative at best, and has nothing really to suggest it's any more likely than any other idea.

This discussion that you're apparently having appears to be limited to exactly one sentence, which was in your post to which I replied.

Even taking that to be the entire discussion, I disagree that it's irrelevant. If the koran is to be taken as a source of belief, then what it originally said when divinely guided, before it was altered by translators and the overzealous, is far more important (and relevant) than what it says now. As whencanistop says, it's effectively a massive game of Chinese whispers.

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"&gt;  Jesus just cursing something for no real obvious reason (i.e. taking out his frustrations on innocent vegetation) just seems completely out of character with anything else he ever does

well I must admit I don't see the problem here. How can vegetation be 'innocent'? can it also be 'guilty'? A tree is a tree, it is inanimate. So I don't really see how this is 'out of character' for Jesus. In fact I can think of some much better examples of 'out of character' behaviour; drowning pigs, turning over tables and whipping animals out of the temple, calling a canaanite woman a dog, etc.

&gt;  This is a guy who managed 40 days in the desert being tempted by Satan himself, and allowed himself to be led to his own death, without uttering a single word of aggression towards the perpetrators of his downfall, and yet he curses a poor tree for no fault of its own.

well that is because you see this as some kind of teenage outburst from Jesus. I don't see it like that; it's not like he kicked the tree or did this in frustration. people project all these assumptions on to it; but there's no evidence he cursed this tree out of anger or anything. He found it lacking in fruit, and cursed it. 

&gt; The Israel explanation seems wildly speculative at best, and has nothing really to suggest it's any more likely than any other idea.

maybe not, I think there are good reasons to consider it given the context and thrust of Mark and Matthew in particular (and Jesus does say things that support such an interpretation).

If we build up a large enough, continuous base then we always have more of a chance and others will feel more inclined to join. Of course this also means taking away folks from UKIP and a few Lib Dems, helping us out and putting them down (though perhaps also helping our biggest rivals :/).

Once we've got our own voters out the door then the real issue really begins, combating caricatured conservatism and making conservative philosophy more palatable. In the cities of the north to be a tory when young is to accept unpopularity, in some cases familys will cast you out. If we stress that we are the party of the working man by emphasizeing our policies to them then maybe just maybe they'll see that their interests really are best served with the conservatives. There's also the issue of winning over the papers. A lot of folks say that what the headlines say doesn't really matter as you only buy a peper you agree with. If you're an apathetic or a skeptic though then all you ever see nowadays is the tories are fucking up. Its not a good image for us and bolsters what Labour say.

It's a difficult task to win the north, but we can fundamentally win seats. Perhaps not in Newcastle or Merseyside just yet but when the newbreed of conservatism comes along then it could be different. Camerons Liberalised policy towards gay marriage and environmentalism has already eradicated the old labels of social conservatism to some extent, winning over a lot more new young people than his predecessors. More of the same is very much on the horizon.

When demographics change, even just a bit due to new waves of immigration; lax planning and education laws and an obsession with serving the local community will lead to the creation of schools like this.  This will only further cement and hasten the pace of change in an area; leading to more folk to move out.

Once again it seems to be impossible to make any kind of statement against any change in your local community.  You might be told the islamic primary school is very good and follows the cirriculum, and that it is no different to kids attending a catholic school, if you're not catholic.

I'm sorry but it is.

Most brits in the UK are on a scale between atheism and some branch of Christianity.  As an agnostic i'm perfectly happy for my kids to go to a school that falls somewhere on that band.  The country; and certainly the major parts of it have broadly Christian morality and history.  yes of course lots have changed and we're all very multicultural now; but the default/background and certainly my culture - the culture I want to pass onto my kids sits within the Church of England/Agnostic/Christian etc. fuzzy spectrum.

Multiculturalism is great when you're in your 20s living in london and enjoying tasty foreign foods and vibrant different shops etc.  It's not so good when you're looking for a good school for your kids.

The sad thing is - multiculturalism can work, but it doesn't because what happens is it's never a 'mix' - it's usually only TWO groups living side by side; and a headcount decides who the majority is and who gets which schools and 'community centres'.

true,boocrap,null,null,"Okay, whilst you are correct that labelling the party as ""full of posh boys"" is unhelpful it cannot be denied that they are suffering a demographic problem that stretches all the way down to local conservative associations unlike when the party was governed by Thatcher (Harold Macmillan once made the creepily anti-Semitic remark that there were ""more Estonians than Etonians in the Cabinet""). The question therefore is do you see any ways to combat this rather dismissing it as unfair?

With regard to your answer I think it buys into an unhelpful fetishisation of what ""evidence based policy"" is. Its a classic case of of instrumental use of reason, one could quite simply say that the healthcare reform was based on very little evidence. It becomes the classic problem of politicians picking and choosing which piece of evidence to follow and using it to back up their ideological underpinnings, a good example of this would unemployment figures. Figures flaunting a growth in jobs mask the fact that many of them are within work programmes and therefore are unpaid, many are part time and many are low paid. instead the Government pretends that these 100,000 new jobs are fair salaried middle income positions and that everyone is happy, dissent is treated with accusation of snobbery as in the Cait Reilly case. Everyone who studies unemployment in detail knows one key thing- the only reason unemployment is singled out as a hot issue is for political reasons, the real problem is under-employment and wage squeezing- the opposition can use it as a signifier  of failed economic policy and the government can use it for the exact opposite reason. This is why it will be particularly hard for Cameron at the next election, Milliband has abandoned the old signifier and has gone after a different one- living standards. In doing so he can point to things like wages (back to 2003 levels) tax thresholds (be they for low earners or populist policies against the financial sector) as signifiers of a failed economic policy. Things which may in fact be out of the governments hands become blows against economic competence. But enough about predictions back to the point.

The problem with your post is that you claim that the Healthcare Legislation (which unfortunately for me I have read) whilst you are right does not explicitly call for the dismantling of the NHS it has a consistent ideological underpinning- that the free market is always best. It is a problem on the Left that arguments against these reforms descend into name calling and moralising but there remains a problem within the government too. Namely that this belief that free market solutions are ultimately non-political and common sense. Personally I find hierarchical institutions such as business as inherently wasteful, but the difference is I don't pretend that that view isn't by definition a political point. Minister after minister has come forward (and the previous Labour government are just as guilty) with new legislation that presumes beyond questioning that the private sector is good.

I'd rather hear a Tory say he believed that the private sector was good because it helped business and that was good because it made money for his political class like at the high point of Thatcherism, rather than any ""evidence based policy"" because at least then it would be linked to political power and not abstract ideology.",0,1361366598,null,0,false,0,c8if9s8,t3_18vpsy,t1_c8if9s8,t1_c8ietmo,null,1431350145,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It does though because nothing happens in isolation. Credit is a finite resource, or at least it should be. If the affluent, whether migrants or otherwise, push credit towards luxury (whether it be credit to expand hotel chains, the hottest new footballing prospect, or an extra swimming pool). Rising house prices in Chelsea affects everything from whether the local shop is a Waitrose or a Pound Shop, affluence affords connectivity so the political landscape becomes skewed, and the prices that the local restaurants can think they can get away with. The surplus money might buy up buy-to-rent accommodation in the locality making it even more difficult to get that  mortgage/buy that house. Maybe you decide to disappear to Manchester to except a lower wage, and that's one job given to a relative interloper.

&gt; By the way, you're welcome to your opinion of the mortgage system, but it's far preferable by any reasonable assessment of its merits to the idea of paying thousands of pounds a month, in pepetuity...

Well, technically you do that anyway (to a lesser degree) through council and other taxes. However, there is at least a third option, a money system not based on interest which penalises the poor and gives money to the rich idlers.

&gt; We don't send children up chimneys or down coalmines any more

I'd argue we do but we just don't see it. There are some very nasty working conditions under US/UK mining companies in Africa and Indonesia. There's all those sweat shops as well. Perhaps we don't own them directly but just as we set the terms under which farmers offed themselves, companies like Primark largely dictate the working conditions in wherever by the amount they are willing to pay, and it isn't very much at all.

We've also hidden or abstracted the violence, even at home with the decay of communities, and if you don't think that is happening look to the race riots, ""economic"" riots of a year or so ago and Occupy. Elsewhere there are millions of people how are dissatisfied with their job and willing, to quote a /r/manchester submission yesterday to ""work for any wage"". I've not even mentioned the 2.70£, 35hr a week, 12 month pseudo-apprenticeships. If you care for the elderly you'll know the subtle violence of social exclusion, and it is so bad for people of all ages that they have to fill the void with 24hrs of TV a week. (Other nuanced violence would be the destruction of green space, delaying childbirth for a decade, and the obesity crisis.)

To sum up the solution must revolve around a democratising of the medium of exchange and how why go about collective decision making.

A whole plate of fish and chips vs a small serving of oily fish with pesto and a mashed potato.

Now I'm not particularly pro-monarchy, but I've got to say something to that. Do you not consider the possibility that she's married to William because they also have very compatible personalities and they are genuinely in love?

I don't understand this mindset that most people seem to have that famous people can't be in love, but marry for shallow reasons. Yes, she's a very pretty girl, but there are lots of pretty girls and William chose her, as she did him.

Why are we comparing these two women? Not because of anything Kate has done, but because Hillary has set herself up to do so. I don't really see how you can look down on someone for having an article written on them by someone who has won literary awards.

The other thing of course is the amount of charity work the couple are involved in. Do we know the full extent of it? Probably not. Their 'jobs' are more than 'being royalty'.

Immigration is a good thing if you run it a bit like recruitment - i.e. let in people only if they can get a job and deport people who overstay or work illegally.

He certainly isn't the best out-and-out winger but he's really the only one we have. Coutinho, Henderson, Borini, Sterling and Sturridge generally like to cut in centrally, which is fine if the buildup play is slow and there is overlap from the left/right back. But if we're on the counter, it's important to have someone who will run towards the by-line, thereby freeing up space for one of the strikers to make a run, and fizz in a cross (personally I think this is when Downing is most effective). TL;DR We should keep Downing but try to bring in a better winger.  ",0,1361369074,null,0,1361369864,0,c8ifpwi,t3_18vvgl,t1_c8ifpwi,t3_18vvgl,null,1431350371,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9
true,suo,uk,Blighty,"I've never been a huge fan of Dubai, having lived there for 6-7 years but you guys are seriously uninformed about the place. First and foremost it's not 'unsafe'. Dubai is the Vegas of the Middle East. It's completely decadent and it's where all the Arabs from surrounding countries flock to get their prostitutes and booze.

People get in trouble now and then because they take things too far. Some police are cunts, as is everywhere but not all of them, I remember being out late once, about 4 am and a policeman on a horse strolled up next to me, questioned what I was doing and then escorted me to a nearby taxi rank. Nothing sinister or unsafe about it at all. 

I hate the place for it's lack of culture, egotistical nature (Locals think Dubai is the centre of the Universe) and hideous expatriates.T he worst thing about Dubai are the self-entitled Brits, Aussies and Saffers who live there and act like they're above everyone else. Not everyone is a complete cunt but a lot of people are. 

I don't want to come off like I'm defending Dubai. I'm just saying I've lived there and from what I've read in this thread a lot of you are clueless as to what it's really like. Yes, it's an Islamic country however I've heard of hundreds of incidents where people have gotten off fine. I suppose every now and then the police like to make an example out of someone. I'd say they're fairly tolerant otherwise. 

They just don't tolerate drugs. Neither does Indonesia, China, Singapore and plenty of other countries.

The up-side of Dubai is it's magnificent architecture, some of the buildings are amazing, great weather (In winter, Summers too hot) and amazing hospitality/service wherever you go. 

And, yes, I'm totally aware of the near slave-labour used on South Asians and Phillipino's.

You don't pay tax. Congratulations. Is this a response to your championing of a new world order, a convenient way of making welfare for the disadvantaged someone else's problem, or something else? 

Despite not earning enough to pay tax, you gave up your car to espouse a moral rather than financial position. This is legitimised by how difficult it is to ride a bicycle. Drivers are nasty to you. 

You don't buy new things. 

You disagree with mortages. I think we've dealt with this one... it's because you perceive it as propping up the financial system. 

You sow prejudice against the military. I find this one slightly more interesting than the others. If military action is used to deflect attention from socio-political fuck-ups, then the military are a political tool. A symptom, not the problem. I'd ask you why you waste your time when the government in question should be the focus, but, thinking about it, I don't care. 

You equate ""good"" work, whatever that is, with ""woman's"" work. 

I believe male prostitutes do exist (and have, for centuries) but I'm intrigued at your assertion that it's the only women's profession to have been readily monetised. I wonder if you're viewing it that way because of the prevailing sexual tastes of the planet and the biological imperatives therein. Let's not get sidelined by this one, though.

true,takesthebiscuit,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"No,  the horse meat issue is the tip of the iceberg, a symptom of the massive drive for profits that is all that interests Tesco.

If you ever visit their head office you can see it starts there.  It is a dull set of 1980's style huts and porto cabins, designed to remind suppliers ""hay look at the sacrifices we make, you should be doing the same"".

This profit drive is visible in all aspects of the stores from the big white uni design sheds, to the lack of staff on the checkouts.

Suppliers are squeezed so hard on price that there is no money to be made on supplying them. They allow just enough to cover raw material costs and little else (a small contribution for overhead recovery).  This leads suppliers down reckless routes like dodgy sourcing agreements.  This is essentially a low risk route, as Tesco don't spend enough on resourcing a proper audit team (compared to say M&amp;S, Waitrose, sainsburys)

Anyway is you want good quality food and service that you can trust go Waitrose or JS, Tesco is only interested in your money.

Here's what I would do if I were you:

Talk to firm A, accept the offer.

Talk to firm B, say you received an offer. Add 20% to the salary they offered you. Put them on the spot for a decision.

Go to your interview tomorrow, explain you have two offers (adding 20% to salaries if they ask you) and explain you really want to work for C, not B or A. Ask them for a decision by the end of the week.

Like hanging. People want hanging back. There was a public poll last year, and I think it was about 50/50; about half of the public would vote to give the government the power to kill them by hanging them from a rope around the neck. That's not a good idea, that's not right, or just, and almost anyone with a say on the matter disagrees with it. Judges don't want it back, politicians don't want it back, anyone who has thought about it for more than half an hour doesn't want it back, and yet if you put it to a referendum there is a really good chance it would be voted back in. It's not *right*, it's definitely not *right*, but it's popular. The whole reason we have elected officials is to, supposedly, put someone who is better informed to make these decisions in power on our behalf.

At lest give the speech a read. She never actually attacks Kate other than in suggesting Kate is at lest being complicit in the crafting of her image by not fighting it. Everything she says about Kate can actually be taken to be a damn complement , she seems nice, pretty, normal and she is actually all told trying to give Kate advice. To explain that she's being used by both the royals and the media as a perfect little thing rather than a person. That she's valued for her use as a blank slate.   

When she called her ""a shop-window mannequin, with no personality of her own"" she isn't saying that Kate necessarily has no personality simply that the media was interested her then for how she looked and now for the fact she's going to have a baby. The same damn thing that royal women has historically, for the most part, been used for. To look good and to have babies.   

She spends the rest of the speech talking about how she's found her self, when face with the royals, reducing them to their function and the things that surround them instead of people. Same premisses in regards to what she was saying about Kate. 

The reason this has gained traction is *not* because it's an attack on Kate but an attack on the people who have an interest in presenting The Princess and the people who consume that soulless empty presentation. It's an attack on people who slack jaw at the use of Kate as an empty thing of pageantry in the same way and for the same reasons people have always done for royal women.

If you tell them your current issues and explain to them how you plan on managing it they can hopefully give you some decent advice or at the very least  make sure they can pick up any problems early.

Paying tax is not the only source of welfare, even if it was does the state do a good job? Taxes are far too readily pushed towards war (40 b£/y), corporate welfare (I can't even guess), projects for the super rich (Olympics), and so on. Consider it a math problem, why are local economies and certain regions dependent on the state? What's the best they can do?

1. 1000£ is spent into the local economy, 200£ is lost through tax (minimum VAT). 800£ is received by the next person who loses 20% in income tax.
2. 640£ is spent into the local economy, 128£ is lost. 512£ is received by the next person who loses 20%.

Throw* in corporate ""soft"" taxation and the blind eye to offshoring and you have a system of wealth extraction and dependency, whether on the state or ""the job creators"".

&gt; Drivers are nasty to you.

I can't blame them, for the large part they are going to jobs they hate.

&gt; You disagree with mortages. I think we've dealt with this one... it's because you perceive it as propping up the financial system.

No, I don't aprove of abusive social relationships. More occluded violence: repossessions.

&gt; You sow prejudice against the military. I find this one slightly more interesting than the others. If military action is used to deflect attention from socio-political fuck-ups, then the military are a political tool. A symptom, not the problem.

People need to be prepared to say no to conscription should it come. Throw the tin-hat accusation at me all you want, but there is clear a clear push to militarise schools, literally, with the poorer places needing purposed military academies and soldiers fast tracked as teachers in general.

&gt; You equate ""good"" work, whatever that is, with ""woman's"" work.

This is incorrect, the latter is an example where for years valuable labour that receives little recognition by the formal economy, skills like child rearing, cooking, steering the domestic ship, caring for elderly, and so on. Oh course this work could be done by men, but it hasn't historically and I don't see the trend having changed much. Also, You misunderstand, I did not say prostitution was exclusively female, but that is one ""career path"" easily pursued and valued by the formal economy (ie people will swap money for sex) across history. Going back quite far:

&gt; Compensation in the Welsh laws is reckoned primarily in cattle and in the Irish ones in cattle or **bondmaids** (cumal), with con­siderable use of precious metals in both. In the Germanic codes it is mainly in precious metal [Debt: First 5000 years]

Yes, woman were so pushed out of the formal economy their very function was to actually *be* currency.

&gt; I ride a bike. I buy second-hand whenever I can. I don't use credit. And I don't feel the need to posture about any of these things, you **ludicrous person**.

I'm not so ludicrous to continue further, and actually riding a bike is literally and figurative revolutionary. It's almost radical.

It seems to be wishful thinking on the part of Alliance members to be frank. Whether they [McCrea &amp; co] found their own party or make the Tories a force to be reckoned with locally it's obvious their voice is an important one as the UUP steps ever more into line behind the DUP.

As for OP's assertion that a strong liberal unionist party is just evidence of more division, apart from the fact at any one point in time there has always been a 'group' of various unionist parties, they obviously overlook the fact that it's not any one individual part that defines the whole, but the sum. 

With that in mind, 'tribal' unionists can vote DUP, the urban 'disenfranchised' loyalist may well throw their lot in with energetic, idealistic young people like Bryson and Harvey and those interested in unionism actually reflecting something approaching the general populace can get behind the liberal entity, whatever form it may take.

true,TheVoiceOfHAL,null,null,"I know you mean well, but what you don't realize is that every time you privatize a service, you give up government power.  

Regulation is an illusion when it comes to big business.  They will push against it and eventually push for it to be scrapped.  If you don't believe it, watch *Enron: The smartest men in the room*. This will happen in the UK as well and has already happened to some extend.  The regulation bodies are little guys compare to the power of big business.  Just look at the Rail companies.  The rail regulator is ineffective and has done little to protect consumers.  And that is what consumers want, **fair prices and protection**, something the government can't guarantee with regulations.   **Essential services should not be run for profit**. And if it is, it should be fair pricing, not pricing at the expense of others.  Pricing for essential services should not allow managing directors and share-holders to fund lavish lifestyles, second homes, large bonuses etc.  That is nothing more than exploitation.  Essential services should be a right, not a gamble.  By all means, if people want that, let them do that on pricing for non-essential services and goods.  

Self-regulation is by far the worst.  Look at the banks, the press.  Look how that has worked.  I can't believe you are in favour of businesses that are responsible for tax evasion, tax loopholes, scandals (Libor, horsemeat etc.) because indirectly that is what you are saying.  We should sell our essential services to these companies and trust the regulators.  Like the energy companies that do not pass savings on to their customers, but pocket the profit for the managing directors and shareholders. 

And I hate to say this, but it was this government that scrapped the Food Standards Agency.  And look where we are today.  I'm sure if a good enough reason could be found, the government would scrap the rail regulator.  

That is why we are in this situation. **Government has less power than big business**.  **And every time you sell of a service, you hand that power to an business or industry on a plate**.  **The government now is nothing more than a plaything, a toy, a pawn for big business**.  The government can't stand up against these companies (not even against the supermarkets that have destroyed industries) because if the government tries, they companies threaten to leave, or make things worse.  

And this is what you want to encourage.  The Conservatives have sold their soul and the soul if the nation to big business.  Conservatives care about business, not the well being of regular folk.  Cameron said we should *all* give our share, but he meant the middle class and those struggling already.  *All* doesn't seem to include the wealthy, who will continue to get wealthy **at the expense of those less fortunate** and privatising is the greatest opportunity for this to happen.  The wealthy will continue to find clever ways not to pay tax, to register their companies in tax havens and to count the pounds, while the regular guy gets screwed.  

You know, I try to imagine myself in your shoes.  I would love to be in your shoes for a week, maybe a month, just to see what it is like.  Maybe I would change my mind.  Could you imagine yourself in the shoes of someone who is constantly seen as an opportunity for profit?  As someone to be exploited?

I disagree *fundamentally* with the idea that what is right and true can be found by public vote. Europe Africa or Asia, Upper Middle or Lower class, rich or poor, present day or 3000BC, I don't think a public vote can find out what is right.

And the more complex the issue, the worse the aim of those unfamiliar with it. Something like ""should your country leave the EU?"" is *such* a complex question, I believe there are *so* few people in a position to really accurately judge it as wise or unwise. I'd think you'd have to have a few years experience with studying European law, an incredible knowledge of European politics, a great understanding of History - so many things need to be considered. Asking me, you, my 93 year old neighbour Ms Jones, my postman, and a few million other people what we think should happen, and then just doing whatever answer comes up the most - how can that have a *better* chance at arriving at the conclusion best for the country, compared to some panel of European Human Rights Lawyers and political analysts, or any other group of experts who will have at least some better idea of what is going on. I just don't believe in it *as a system, as an idea* - nothing to do with rich or poor, haves or have-nots. I wouldn't believe in it in some classless, post currency utopia either.

So they need someone or something to back them up in that argument against Westminster. So they issue a referendum to gain some weight to their argument. If they thought the public would definitely vote against it, they wouldn't issue it.

The SNP want to lower the voting age to 16 in that referendum. You know why? It's not because they think that 16 year olds are wise and informed agents well prepared to make a judgement on the fall of the union - if they thought that, they would lower the voting age for everything else. The reason WHY is because they polled 16 to 18 year-olds, and found they are likely to vote YES to independence, and so want to include them as a demographic, to sway the vote.

That's how referendums work, they are a *tool* for politics, the idea that they are some enlightened method to find what is true and just is just total bunk. ",0,1361375519,null,0,false,0,c8ihare,t3_18tyxv,t1_c8ihare,t1_c8iglvc,null,1431351095,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

You also dodge and prevaricate a lot. This is a pity, as I don't know if I'm actually hearing your opinion. 

Using the paltry way in which HMRC pursues corporations as a reason for not paying tax is actually quite repellent cynicism: odd in someone who, on the surface at least, purports to be so idealistic. I have absolutely no idea where you got that taxation model from, and I'm not even going to try to understand it. 

But really? To say that you don't trust the government of the country you've chosen to live in with the taxes that it is your civic duty to pay? And yet you avail yourself freely of the benefits of the taxes of others? The roads, at a most basic level, that you cycle on? The casualty department of the hospital that you go to when someone knocks you off that bicycle? I find that disgusting. And your argument about where the taxes go is nonsense. I didn't vote for the half-arsed government we currently have. I disagree with its foreign policy, its economic policy and the dress sense of its leaders, but I don't feel that entitles me to stop paying tax. Taxes are social capital: they pay teachers; they pay nurses; they pay for care of the elderly. 

I haven't accused you of conspiracy nonsense, however tempting it might be. But I do wonder what sort of upbringing you had, to harbour such fear of the state. Militarising schools, indeed. The government - most governments, certainly in the western world and operating professional armies - depend on the disadvantaged and undereducated for the bulk of their armed forces. Decent education is virtually at odds with the military: the more skills someone has, the better educated they are, the less likely they are to be forced into a military career.

To put it another way.

I googled the death penalty thing. It lead me to [The UK Polling Report here](http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/3802) which leads to the actual survey [here](http://cdn.yougov.com/today_uk_import/YG-Archives-Pol-Prospect-SocialMoralIssues_101026.pdf).

It says basically  
**DO YOU FAVOUR THE DEATH PENALTY FOR MURDER?**  
Yes, Always..................................................................16%  
Yes, Sometimes, depending on the circumstances................58%  
No, the death penalty is wrong.........................................23%  
Don't know.....................................................................3%

So if it went to a referendum, to bring back hanging, we are talking about 3 to 1, which means even if these figures are way way off, it would probably still get passed.

The people of this country, will vote, pretty overwhelmingly, to give their government the power to kill them. 

The government currently doesn't have the power to hang me from the neck until dead. The reason why it doesn't have that power is because there are informed, educated people who have studied justice and morality and politics and law, and they won't re-introduce hanging, because they know that, while popular, it is wrong, unreliable, goes against the idea that it is better to let a guilty man go than condemn an innocent man, doesn't solve much, doesn't reduce crime rates, and so on and so on.

But if it were up to the public, the government *would* have the power to hang me from a rope around the neck until dead.

Come, very soon!  


And lift forever the sad curse  
once laid in dull, sarcastic verse  
by one whose poetry is worse  
than Mills and Boon!  


Sir John - oh, what a sense of farce!  
A poet of the teacup class  
obsessed with railways, and stained glass  
and twisted bough  

and thus impervious to the call  
of the post-war suburban sprawl  
of Harlow, Basildon and all  
and glorious Slough!

home of a thousand training schemes  
and theme pubs, patronised by streams  
Of tetchy men  


with blow-dried hair and blow-dried brain  
diplomas in inflicting pain  
and ne'er a thought for Larkin, Raine  
and Betjeman!  


A thousand jewellers' shops contend  
The kitchen unit is your friend  
Designer labels set the trend  
with a blank stare  


And now - the latest, brightest star -  
a brand new ten screen cinema!  
The folk will come from near and far  
to worship there!  


Oh self-made, independent town!  
The jewel in Margaret's southern crown!  
No more will poets put you down  
with mocking voice!  


Come tourists all, and flock to Slough  
as Milton Friedman takes a bow  
This town is fit for heroes now -  
Come, and rejoice!

At the start of each trial, when the jury is sworn in, the judge will give a short but clear blurb of what they are expected to do throughout the proceeding (deciding guilt only when it can be beyond all reasonable doubt, that if they are ever approached by witnesses they must report it immediately etc.)

This will also usually be accompanied by a document outlying these same responsibilities. Even in trials where a juror isn't sure of a legal event or meaning of a phrase, then the court clerk or usher can usually be directed to clear it up. If an unusual event happens throughout the trial (e.g. a matter must be heard without the public present) then the judge will always explain this.

The judges I've seen, even the most hardarse, jowly, Etonians treat the jury with a lot of smiles and take their time with them (it's a brand new experience for anyone called up to jury duty) - in this case, though, it seems he was fed up of their incompetencies and lost his rag.

true,SamLeeLee,null,null,"You make some good point but fundamentally I must disagree.

A running theme of your argument is that we cannot trust private business. There is a lot to suggest that we shouldn't but that is only when we have weak politicians. I do not giving away government power when we privatise. We are a country that is supposed to be ruled by the people and we are giving the power back to them. When the government is in charge of some services like rail or healthcare we, the taxpayer, have the bill to pay and the service is ran badly.  Businesses are run to make profit and as such can be brutal and unforgiving, but they do not have to be. When an institution is run just to provide a service then we see the management become inefficient, bureaucratic and overbearing. With good regulation we can combine the two. I am a realist, I believe though that with a strong government we can have essential services ran in a free market, while also being affordable and with good levels of customer service. This system relies though on the politicians being strong and enforcing good, simple and minimalistic regulation. With strong leadership there are no illusions. The actions of of some business leaders and bank bosses are disgusting, I will not defend them for they have messed with real peoples lives. For such behavior the government, the regulation should see them in jail rather than let them continue to fuck the people. Conservative philosophy dictates this but sadly the party does not do it for the sake of ease and perhaps even funding.

I wasn't at any point suggesting self regulation. I was suggesting let the free market take on more of a responsibility,t trust it more, and when it behaves punish it. What you are suggesting forgets that when the state runs things it does not assure quality service, only higher taxes more bureaucracy and a greater burden on future generations.

Government right now isn't but should be the protecter of the people for when big business becomes overbearing, but a supporter of big business at every turn. Labour retracted in sheer fear from business and investment in favour of reckless public spending and look at the situation that put us in. With regulation ans sanctions and strong government you can fundamentally control and bete ally of the wild beast that you say is untamable.

The Conservatives are not the party of selling souls, they are the party of sensible economics, wise investment and justice. This can struggle to show through as there are some weak and appaling conservatives out there. The Labour party pander to an innate but incorrect notion that the rich are rich at our extent. That we can make life better by legislating them out of prosperity. The conservatives in their tenure have made the rich pay their fair share more than Labour did in their 13 years. 45p tax rate for instance, they get it wrong with this new inheritance tax but this is not symbolic of the parties wider actions, it does not help them. They are not the party for the rich but the party for everyone including the rich. All giving our fair share means getting together in hard economic times in order to pull through it, it's symbolism not everyone can vocally get behind but its there subtly.

I can only offer my sympathies with regard to the last paragraph. If you are someone to be exploited it is because you imagine you are. The Tories do not do enough right now, but conservative philosophy has us all as victors if we embrace it. A walk in my shoes I imagine could be enlightening.

I think this kind of culture has been more detrimental to British values than any amount of immigration can or ever will be. We used to go down the grocers, to the butchers, the fish mongers, to local markets - food brought you closer to your community. The white British have totally turned their back on this in favour of supermarkets and fast food. You know who still goes to the markets, the butchers, the fish mongers, the grocers? I think modern consumer culture has encouraged us to do more damage to our culture than anything else, by a country mile. Anyway, that's a massive tangent, but I think it's interesting.


&gt;certain cultures and groups we probably shouldn't even try to integrate, we just shouldn't let in at all.

His injuries have just been brutal, and not really indicative of being an injury prone player.  He's not doing his hamstring every 3 weeks or struggling with little niggles and strains.  He broke his foot (been there, it SUCKS) and dislocated his shoulder (also been there, easily the most painful injury Iv'e had that wasn't life-threatening)... they're both serious injuries that don't happen often.  He'll get past them and come good for us.  What we need to do now as supporters is get behind him and be positive about him.

&gt; dodge and prevaricate

It may be the case that I have drifted into vagaries to not disclose personal information.

&gt; Using the paltry way in which HMRC pursues corporations as a reason for not paying tax is actually quite repellent cynicism: odd in someone who, on the surface at least, purports to be so idealistic.

I don't think I made that claim. I don't think I mentioned lax corporate collection, but that would be another reason, instead I mentioned support for the military, general poor spending, and the mathematical certainty that local economies serve external interests. The last one is the most important one. In the UK the GINI coefficient is worse after taxation relative to other similar countries—they go up the table of equality, we go down.

&gt; To say that you don't trust the government of the country you've chosen to live

Sorry, I didn't not book my mother's uterus ahead of time. 

&gt; And yet you avail yourself freely of the benefits of the taxes of others?

It is patently false that to not be a free-rider one must pay tax, which gets us back to the initial idea: not all work is judged labour, not all labour is work. I earn as little as possible and another after that my time is donated to general self improvement. I do not need the roads, I could happy cross grass or muck, which oddly I have to do anyway.

It's a second rate competition to keep everyone happy. Sponsors and TV companies want more money, so we'll have group stages (may as well call it CL light in this regard).

We have to be seen to be rewarding fair play, so we'll throw some places to the fair play winners. We also need a prize for the cup competitions, well they can go in as well.

And what about the CL teams that are too shit to get through the CL groups, but still huge clubs that will pull in the money? Well we could just chuck them in as well, fuck the teams that have been in the tournament for months at this point, playing god knows how many games (Fulham had to play 19 to get to the final. 19 games. Half a season. That's like playing each team 3 times in the league, plus domestic cups on top.) to win the thing.

But that's all ok, because the winner of this prestigious award (that has absolutely not been completely devalued by the CL) is now the champion, so gets to play in the CL! Wait, that's not right, 4th place in the PL is an achievement worthy of more reward than winning the Europa League, 'the 2nd most lucrative non-league competition' (I'd like to see your source for this by the way, would the Copa Del Rey or FA Cup not be more 'lucrative' once TV money is taken into account?).

In my opinion there are 2 things that would fix it, and I'd like both to be implemented but would be happy with.

Either make it a knockout competition from the beginning, or give the winner a CL spot.

Over the last few years I've become fed up seeing Spurs struggle at the end of a PL match after a weekend trip to Europe.

I don't see it changing under the Conservatives, Labour, Lib-Dem or any political party that affiliates themselves with big business.  

If you want a better view of what I'm feeling, [watch this video](http://www.moveon.org/share/72e232/hollywood-legend-ed-asner-has-outraged-republicans?rc=share-07858c) about the situation in the US.  **This is where we are heading, and in some cases, where we are already**. 

I must point out that I do not support the Conservatives.  I do not support, Labour, Lib-Dem or any political party in this country.  Citizens in this country have no choice, because whoever you vote for, will only give your money to big business.  Maybe if the government (whether Conservative, Labour) had the guts, the strength to actually take on business and protect its citizens, I would be inclined to trust the political system again.  But while we still have government ministers in chauffeured cars driving to work, while the rest of us spend our earnings on over-priced train fares (as an example), there is no way to believe it will get better for the regular person.

I'd like to think that when either Super Frankie or JT retires, they'll have most if not all of his coaching badges done and will be able to join Jose's managerial team for some good experience, wherever Jose may manage.

After a year or two of following Jose around, they come in as either Assistant Manager or Youth Team Manager etc and work their way up from there. Big personalities and both are top top top condidates to become managers.

They probably are more expensive but I appreciate their 1 hour delivery slots, welcoming and helpful drivers, and the ""delivery pass"" thing they have is good as it makes the delivery costs a bit cheaper too.

Also Ocado pickers pick their orders in a warehouse that is largely itemised by an inventory system, so when you do your shopping it usually knows in advance if something is most likely to go out of stock by the time your order is picked - so in my experience they seem to offer less substitutions and surprises by the time your order gets delivered to the door.

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"&gt; Ermm - that's exactly what happened. Jesus was a Jew. He didn't invent Christianity - it took over 100 years[1] for the two religions to split.

the first christians were christians who were also Jews. Christianity never 'split' from Judaism (That would imply all Jews recognised Jesus from the start, which of course the majority did not); rather Christians were those who saw Jesus as the Jewish Messiah and worshipped him as such. 

Jesus did indeed 'start' christianity, and just a few short years after his death people were beginning to be known as christians (as distinct from Jews). [acts 11:26](http://bible.cc/acts/11-26.htm).

&gt; You mean something like the Council Of Nicaea[2] ?

no, not at all like that. at no point at the council of nicaea did they decide who should be the figurehead of the 'new religion' (which is patently ridiculous, Christianity had been around for 300years by the time of that council). 

&gt; The status of Jesus at that time was unclear enough that a vote was taken as to whether he should be considered divine or not.

which is not at all like deciding who the figure head of the new religion should be.

&gt;On 20 January, the heads of eleven of the world's leading economic bodies—Christine Lagarde of the IMF, Robert Zoellick of the World Bank, Pascal Lamy of the WTO, Mark Carney of the FSB, Margaret Chan of the WHO, Angel Gurría of the OECD, Donald Kaberuka of the AfDB, Haruhiko Kuroda of the ADB, Luis Alberto Moreno of the IADB, Josette Sheeran of the WFP, and Juan Somavia of the ILO—called for economic policies that would foster growth, and warned of the dangers of austerity.

Refugees are different - they are relocated by the UN refugee agency. But nearly all asylum seekers in the UK are there for economic reasons only. How could I make such a sweeping statement? Because under the ""safe third country rule"" all asylum seekers are required to apply for asylum in the first safe country they reach. If you look at a map of the world, there are a hell of a lot of safe countries that a prospective asylee has to pass through in order to reach the UK from China, Africa, Pakistan, anywhere. In fact, it's nearly impossible to avoid them even if you are trying. Nevertheless, the UK only selectively and half-heartedly enforce this rule.

[Even France isn't good enough for them](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/1339071/44-asylum-seekers-in-Channel-Tunnel-trek.html).

I don't support a welfare state either.  But I will say again, **essential services that are part of human rights** do not belong in the hands of big business.  

I work.  I pay tax.  I pay NI.  I get furious when I hear of people sponging off the state.  People who expect the state to provide.  People need to take responsibility for their lives.  

But the government should look after its citizens.  The way the government does that is by ensuring **basic needs and rights** such as energy, education, food, etc. are protected.  Help everyday people with the basics so that they can live. Instead, what we have is a situation where we now work just to pay for the basics.  

Again, I'm not against capitalism, or the rich.  All I'm saying is that essential services should be provided through fair pricing.  Big business won't do that.  And it is rather sad and worrying (but perhaps not surprising) that you believe big business will look after the needs of the regular person.  They take care of their own.  They take care of profits and share-holders.  

By handing them that power, the government is not giving power back; it's abdicating power.  

Maybe if regulation was effective and tough I would feel different, but nothing to date has provided evidence that regulation will be the answer.  

You know, there are other non-essential services that can be sold off.  Example, why are we still paying for Radio 1?  It should be a commercial station.  I know it is a small example, but if you look at what is essential in people's lives everyday, there are things tax payers pay for that is not essential. I like listening to opera, but actually how essential is opera to the everyday person struggling to pay their energy bills?  

I hope you don't see my responses as attacks.  I found your last response somewhat defensive, and I'm sorry if my responses came across as attacking you or your view.  I just believe strongly in the notion that everyday services are rights, and not to be sold off to the highest bidder.

Thanks for taking the time to read and reply.  I won't bother you again.

But many brilliant teams contain 'average' players such as downing and cannot function without them. He and Henderson are crucial to us at the moment, not necessarily for what they offer on the ball either. 

John O'Shea and Wes Brown at Utd spring to mind. In isolation pretty 'average' defenders, internationals both of them but were hardly sought after by other clubs, but both had long spells in the first team and their versatility and dependability of a virtually guaranteed '7 out of 10' performance was a massive part of Utd's success back then. 

You'll notice that SAF has a massive knack for finding and keeping these types of players. 

So, to answer the question: Downing should be so much more than a sub. Should he start every game? In an ideal world probably not, should he warm the bench week in, week out? Certainly not.

For me, I'd roll my eyes at that PM and delete it and be done with it, but it's not about how ""hard"" someone is, words can be hurtful and a big part of that is the unexpectedness. We're here to talk about Liverpool, and these comments don't exist in a vaccum. They come from discussion about the team.

No one sends a message to someone else for no reason. They're for posting rumors or saying something in a match thread or discussion thread about a player or something like that.

You should talk about that, why you hate Downing or why Assaidi is awesome and BR is wrong, but going to private message to antagonize other people is low. It's not cool and there's no reason for it.

Yes - but that wasn't ""Christianity"", just another of the many many Jewish sects that were flourishing at the time. It certainly didn't include peace, love and Gentiles until much later.

&gt; just a few short years after his death people were beginning to be known as christians

Well, as that passage from Acts refers to events around AD50, about 20 years actually, which again supports the point that JC didn't *invent* anything.

&gt;no, not at all like that

Sorry, but your original statement was ""some kind of council or group decided things like..."" . OK - the figurehead may have been established, but there was obviously a lot of disagreement about the other stuff, including the basic fact as to whether he was the son of Jahweh or not.

&gt;what impact did they have, and why was Jesus so much more significant

Seriously? How about the [First Jewish Roman War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Jewish-Roman_War) for starters?

The basic point is that religious leaders have cropped up out of the woodwork every few years for many many centuries. Some get lucky (Joseph Smith, Mohammed, L Ron Hubbard, Jesus, Sidharttha Guatama) , some not so lucky.

* They actually do things like crash testing of child car seats.
* I've not noticed a hideous bias like many online review sites - I suspect they pay for the products rather than get supplied for review.

true,RabidRaccoon,cnty-expat,Expat,"&gt; So you don't actually want a change in policy. In fact, you want our policy to be more lenient. And you want it to be enforced better.

No, I want immigration to UK, Plc to be run like recruitment. In fact I want immigration to only let in people who can get in jobs so essentially we'll outsource almost the entire process to the people who do recruitment in companies and Universities. I.e. no refugees, no asylum seekers. If you can get a job you should get in. If you can't then sorry, but it's not our problem - we'll ship you back no matter what gruesome fate awaits you. This is not the 1930's and we're not letting in persecuted Jewish academics anymore. We're letting in loads of people with no marketable skills. 

If people are persecuted academics they'd need to get a job before they arrive. Which is not hard to do these days if their skills really were the sort of skills which enrich the economy. 

&gt; And there are people who are not at all well integrated who massively enrich our economy (see Russian Oligarchs, Saudi Royals etc).

Ok, I'd let in people who could demonstrate they have investments overseas with which they could support themselves too. So if you make more than an average wage from your investments I'd let you in. However you would not be eligible to receive more in benefits than you'd paid into the tax system. Also if you break the law you get deported.

However I'd have a process by which people who've stayed in the country for 5 years, paid taxes and not broken the law would be able to apply for permanent residence or citizenship at their option. Their children would be citizens.

A lot of this is already done by the US, or Taiwan or Australia. Even South Korea has a US based system. Though being Koreans they've hacked the US law they copied a bit so that people with ""Korean blood"" get special treatment. Taiwan has a funny attitude to things - on the one hand they prefer ethnic Chinese, on the other you can't be an ROC citizen if you are a PRC citizen.

So they want the ethnicity but they don't want PRC citizens. But apparently if you were a European born in China you'd be preferred. 

Now in UK terms I think we should give preferential treatment to people who have ancestors who were UK citizens. 

If you look at Australia they have a points system and I believe they do the equivalent. Someone asked Farage what UKIP immigration policy was and he said ""That's easy. It's the same as what Australia does"". That would be a big improvement on what we have.

Actually another thing I strongly support is the UK's ""non dom"" status. As I understand it if you're willing to pay £30K per year the Inland Revenue will ignore your offshore income.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/expat-money/7465517/Non-dom-status-do-you-qualify.html

&gt; The advantages of a non-dom status can be considerable for those with large amounts of investment income. Up until April 2008, all non-doms could avoid paying tax on earnings from overseas investments. But since then, you only enjoy this advantage for the first seven years that you live in the UK.
&gt;
&gt; After that, you can opt to avoid paying tax on your offshore income, but you have to pay HMRC £30,000 for the privilege. This effectively means that for the first seven years you are in the UK, claiming non-dom status is worth doing regardless of how much you are earning offshore. But after that period, it is only worth doing if you are going to save more than £30,000 a year.

So if you're a Saudi prince or a Russian oligarch you can cap your tax bill at £30K and be a UK resident. This is a very good deal for both sides. Most taxpayers pay a lot less than £30K per year in tax. And most countries would charge people like this a lot more. 

Now for obvious reasons this sort of deal is not going to be offered to UK taxpayers - only to foreigners. But other countries offer similar deals, and I'd recommend if you're a UK taxpayer you should shop around to find somewhere you like that will give you a good deal on residence. Asia is where all the opportunities are anyway.

Also a culture that is to continue to grow and get along (New Zealand is a nice example again) all cultural backgrounds must have the same respects for their current land - i.e. must want to fight side by side and have similar beliefs in life values.

The way the British isles are being populated further dilutes this and will only end up heading to civil war.

But then there are plenty of examples of this around the world, Shi'a–Sunni's relationships within a sole country, the basque country in Spain or even Chechnya. 

My point away from lack of work in the UK is that the UK is heading for disaster unless there is a better immigration policy and better education or respect from those coming here.

We can't punish them because of the poor choices of the mother and when you have 11 kids, you do need a pretty big house. As long as the money the mother is getting from the state is being spent properly in raising her children, I don't see any fault in the system. As long as those 11 children are being given access to a good education in order to grow up and become productive members of society, it's no problem to me. Having 11 children is economically unwise for almost *anyone*, but meh. It's done. And if the mother has cancer, then her capacity to earn money is severely compromised. Even if she was healthy and had a full time job, earning enough to raise 11 kids isn't easy. Families like this are in the vast minority anyway. To focus on them is going to incite anger for no real reason. What else would you do? Say ""sorry, you had too many children and we're going to put them through misery to punish you for your poor choices""?

All British children, no matter how or why they're brought into this world, deserve the basic needs of life - a roof over their heads, clothing, food and education. And by British I don't mean white, I mean any child residing in the UK. Why? Because we're a first world country and that should be an important priority for us no matter what. Is it shocking that a mother of 11 is given a large house by the state? Maybe a little, but what alternative would there be?

Maybe we're sometimes branded as a ""benefits state"", but I'd prefer that all members of British society were taken care of than any alternative.

1) Immigration is tightly controlled. There are few immigrants and they are less likely to be dependent on state benefits than the natives. People tend to be quite friendly to the few that they meet. E.g. the US or Taiwan.

2) Immigration is very loosely controlled. Immigrants are more likely to be dependent on state benefits than the natives. People are very anti immigrant. Cries of racism are made to keep them quiet. E.g. the UK or Sweden.

I.e. ""an upsurge in racism"" isn't the problem it is merely a symtom. The problem is that you've poured in the immigrants too quickly and they've formed clumps. If you were making a sauce you wouldn't complain the sauce had experienced an ""upsurge in clumpiness"". You'd add things more slowly.

I understand your frustration, I used to work at an Asda on Sunday afternoons as a teenager and it was difficult to actually *get* any work done when you had so many customers to get through. Any supermarket is going to get that way when it's overcrowded, especially the lower priced ones that attract the most shoppers. Even middle class/upper class shoppers may opt for cheaper supermarkets since they too will want to spend less money on groceries. 

I can't speak for self-service checkouts much but I usually opt for a real cashier. It'll be smoother even if it's worth waiting in a queue. I only use self-service checkouts if I want 1 item or something. If it's my weekly shop, I go for an actual cashier every time. I think self-service checkouts are only meant to be for smaller transactions anyway.

But it could vary from place to place. The Sainsbury in my town is okay, but I never use it because I'm riff raff. I just pop into it if I want one or two things, since it's closer to my house. It doesn't seem any different from Asda - just more expensive.

It's pretty simple, if there's something you don't like - don't watch/listen/read it, if enough people decide they don't like something, it won't be popular, and will stop being aired/printed.

The best thing you can do is try and explain your own opinions and try and get those that are in the wrong (in your own eyes) to see it your way. But at the end of the day, it's their opinion, and as far as I'm concerned, people should be allowed to say whatever they want - obviously that's quite a lot different from physically touching someone, or breaching the peace - but obviously breaching the peace isn't really always a clear cut thing. 

However, obviously, the annoying side of this, is that people have the right to complain as much as they want too. Some times you just feel like ... fuck free will. It's a blessing and a curse.

Basically, to each their own, so long as it's not physically harming people, and of course those situations where people are being verbally abused and scared of their partner / parent etc. 

Fuck me, I should just stop, by the very nature of this, I can't present a valid opinion stating this is how it should be because everyone has the right to do their own opinion and is free to disagree.

Anyone out there know if this is legal?

The police are then obliged to refer the matter to the DVLA as the matter needs to be chased up from their end.

Not only is it a criminal offence to gain entry into a film if you are underage, it is also an offence for the cinema to admit such people (hence the need for checks to cover themselves legally). But it's a far more serious offence to alter a driving licence - penalties include jail, up to 12 points on a licence or revocation of licence or an extended driving ban. Remember a driving licence can be used as sole photo ID for air travel, so illegal use can be considered a very serious matter. I'll just quote Section 25(5) of the Identity Cards Act 2006:

    It is an offence for a person to have in his possession or under his control, without
    reasonable excuse:
    
            (a) an identity document that is false;

I think you've confused Ramires with Luiz for a CDM. Putting Ramires in that position is a huge waste of what makes him a good player. His stamina and speed means he's a box to box CM (or winger), so he needs to constantly link up with Mata and our wide men on the counter.

I'd happily shift Luiz to be a permanent CDM who can play CB. So we'd have Mikel, Luiz and Romeu to play in that spot, we just need a someone to play next to either of them. For me, that could be Lampard, KVD and Oscar (with the later two being able to play in a more forward attacking role).

I'd like Josh to go out on a half-season loan and then be recalled in the winter break to bring some fresh legs who's had game time.

Defensively, we need to bring our youth back, Bruma and Wallace would be the ideal candidates. While they won't get huge game time, they need to get settled into Chelsea for the following year (JT will leave then).",0,1361407044,null,0,false,0,c8is1g0,t3_18wdic,t1_c8is1g0,t1_c8ikpee,null,1431356347,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

true,widgetas,pink,Will Grow Beard For Food,"&gt; that 'marriage' should be a solely religious institution... people have an irrational attachment to the term 'marriage.'

Given that 'marriage' has never belonged solely to anyone particular people, society or religious group, or non-religious group for that matter, and that 'marriage' has existed in various forms - including unions between people of the same sex back-in-the-day - and not forgetting that the Marriage Act 1836 gave people in this country the option of having an entirely non-religious marriage in registry offices (the union being freed from *having* to be performed by an Anglican to be recognised)... why should this particular pact belong/be given to the religious?

Some might deem it picky, or pedantic, given that on a fundamental level the situation is the same if someone was to have a ""civil union"" or a ""marriage"", but I think it's an important point and one that shouldn't be lost to - let's face it - a vocal minority of traditionalists who no doubt would have been against the 1836 Act as religious people were at the time.

My own personal view on this is that the French (and others) have the best idea. The state only recognises marriages via a ceremony performed in a state building by a state official, while any religion (if recognised?) is free to perform their own blessing as they see fit. Given that surely the religious are only interested in the blessing of their deity and in the right holy place by the right holy person, I'm not sure why any particular groups (save the CoE - quick, disestablish!) would get uppity about such an arrangement. After all (ignoring being registered for the activity) the priest, the building and the vows etc. aren't the marriage - signing the book is the important bit, afaik.",0,1361409470,null,0,false,0,c8isu8p,t3_17tup7,t1_c8isu8p,t1_c88taza,null,1431356667,1,false,bristol,t5_2r52c,1

Di Canio is another good shout, but I'm less comfortable with him.

true,str0yr,mcgann,McGann,"&gt;I'm not saying they definitely use Netflix

You're basing your point on the assumption that the author uses Netflix, and is confusing for them. I checked out the author's blog; they're a mathematician. Obviously, they're not easily confused. They also enjoy Torchwood^1 which implies they have a solid attachment to the Whoniverse and with the amount of news flying around right now about the 50th anniversary (news which has been around since nearly 2 years before the article was published),^2 any intelligent fan would realise that ""Series 1"" isn't the first. You mentioned Netflix 9 times before I pointed out that wasn't a strong platform. Me? I don't even use it. There are millions of people who don't. It's not ""likely"" that they used Netflix. Netflix have approximately 27.1 million US subscribers.^3 That's 11.6% of the ~315,000,000 people in the United States (where the author is based).^4 11.6% probability isn't likely at all. Even if I compare that against households, the number is only 20.5%. That's still not likely.^5

&gt;Author: ""...this despite the show constantly and inexplicably treating her as second-class to Rose!""

Rose is still a relevant character in the series at this point, and a bit of a fan favourite.^6

&gt;Quit letting reddit break up your Logopolis viewing.

I use RES and rarely close my browser, it sits open on my second monitor so I can reddit whilst doing anything else. I multi-task quite well. Normally I'd be open to level and factual debate but this is just getting tedious. It wasn't a comment on my inability to do something else whilst redditing, it was a hint for you to re-evaluate what I've said. With every response I've made, I've gone back and re-read what you've written so that I know I fully comprehend your point of view. I do, honestly. But your view is based on a great big ""if"" (Netflix and differences in terminology). I'll admit I've used some guesswork too, but I don't base my entire point off it.

""The Power of Three"" gave a nod to the Brigadier. ""The God Complex"" referenced *The Horns of Nimon*. The Doctor cycles through his old regenerations in ""The Rebel Flesh"". ""Closing Time"" reintroduced the Cybermats. ""The Vampires of Venice"" showed us the Doctor's first (or First) library card. ""Vincent and the Doctor"" had the TARDIS showing us the first two Doctors, and ""The Lodger"" had a brief flashback of some of the classic Doctors (to say nothing of the holographic projection in ""The Eleventh Hour"").

true,chemosabe,null,null,"Brit living in the states here (for the past 14 years) so I feel pretty qualified to comment on this issue.

Yes, petrol in the US is massively cheaper than pretty much everywhere else in the world and there are various reasons for that.

What you have to realise is that the absolute price isn't the issue. It's the relative increase. Between January 2006 and December 2012, the average price in England went from [90p/litre to 139p/litre](http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/nov/12/uk-fuel-price-over-time). An increase of 54%.

Between 2005 and 2012 in the US, the price went from a low of [$1.86/gallon to about $3.80/gallon](http://gasbuddy.com/gb_retail_price_chart.aspx). An increase of 104%.

So, yes.. it's easy to point fingers at the yanks and laugh at them about their super cheap petrol, but bear in mind that the relative increase and how it impacts ones cost of living is the bigger issue, and this is what pretty much all of them are complaining about. Also, much of America is built around driving. A lot of major cities have crappy public transport options, so people are used to commuting in their cars. As a result, an increase of over 100% to their transportation costs has a major impact on their budget.

Is it serving as a wakeup call? Absolutely. People are increasingly aware of the costs and are demanding more efficient cars. Is there a certain amount of schadenfreude about witnessing their ""downfall"" from their oblivious, wasteful tendencies? Maybe. Is their complaining unreasonable?

It doesn't. And while I realise I'm not explaining my point that well, that's the point. 

&gt; Sex is sex, as natural as eating, drinking, sleeping.

It's not the *same* as eating or drinking though. It's a deeply intimate deeply personal act. 

&gt; Saying it is special ( which is fair enough for -you- ) is only subjecting the poor young women and girls to name calling and judgements, it is sex, and sex is something THEY should choose. 

They're still just kids, and pretty immature. Making sure they understand that this is *their* decision. Not something they should do because of peer pressure and nagging. And girls do. There's a lot of pressure from society, and from friends. 

They don't have the life experience to know why this is important. They're still virgins. 

The name calling and judgements will happen and pretending it wont just because you're so trendy and non-judgemental is not just hopelessly naive, but actively harmful.

Retailers rely on passing trade and if you have less people passing you have less people coming in.  It's not just parking but allowing out of town retail parks.  Parking is a major issue.  Most town councils see their car parks as revenue generators.  I will give two examples of where council policy has directly changed my shopping habits.  In Chorley people used to pass their tickets to each other, so if you paid for 2 hours but left before one you'd offer your ticket to someone coming in.  The council still gt their per hour revenue and it fostered a community feel a it got people speaking to each other.  Then the council replaced the ticket machines with ones where you have to enter you regestration number.  I mistyped typed and got a fine even though clearly it was my car. I stopped using the car parks with those machines and parked in a different part of town and as a result changed the shops I visited. In Chelmsford they charge £1 to park after 7pm in unused car parks.  Last week cars were double parked and blocking side roads on one street that have a tesco metro, KFC, chippy and Chinese all in a 50 metre space.  But directly behind these shops is a large empty car park.  But rather than pay £1 to park I drove to another part of town to go to that chippy.  It might sound and be petty but my actions are replicated thousands of times a day.  Unless councils accept that they have a role in the demise of the high street, which I think is also down to letting major brands open out of town, then small retailers will continue to feel the negative effects.

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"&gt; Yes - but that wasn't ""Christianity"", 

yes, christianity began as a Jewish sect. It was still christianity. 

&gt; just another of the many many Jewish sects that were flourishing at the time. It certainly didn't include peace, love and Gentiles until much later.

you're starting to show some real ignorance now. Some of the earliest christian churches were Gentile churches, established just a few years after Jesus death. 

&gt; Well, as that passage from Acts refers to events around AD50, about 20 years actually, which again supports the point that JC didn't invent anything.

how so? these churches were a direct consequence of his message and his followers. 

&gt; but there was obviously a lot of disagreement about the other stuff, including the basic fact as to whether he was the son of Jahweh or not.

I don't dispute this, but it doesn't bear any relevance to what you originally took issue with; the idea that christianity was invented years later by some council and Jesus was posthumously appointed as figurehead.

&gt; Seriously? How about the First Jewish Roman War[1] for starters?

which had as significant an impact as christianity? 

&gt; and of course, although not wanting to start anything else, this is all assuming that he actually existed in the first place

which is the only historically accurate assumption

&gt;  which seems to be increasingly questioned

not by any mainstream historian or academic

&gt; as unlike many of the other names I mentioned, there are no contemporaneous accounts of his life

citation needed. seriously, just try this one. 

&gt; The ""impact"" of Christianity is much more to do with mundane factors like the size and influence of the Roman Empire than the ""specialness"" of yet another Jewish Messiah, I'm afraid.

Well I'm afraid I think this is ridiculous. There are simply no religious figures similar to Jesus who had any kind of comparable impact. the closest thing is Muhammed, who spread his religion via the sword. Jesus message spread within a few decades to the centre of the known world, and with 300years of non-violent presence and actually *suffering* violent persecution, it was the biggest religion in the known world.

it's hugely disingenuous of the Mail to pretend people are being forced out against their wishes, the amount of people on Grand Designs who were building their dream house in the country so as to 'escape the ratrace' is significantly significant in itself!  The fact is it's a trope of these property programs and country living type magazines, a successful urban couple relocating to the country - this is because living in a rural area is awesome while living in a city is stressful and smelly.  
  
If anything the immigration is simply covering a shift towards deurbanization, as more and more jobs are done from home ever larger numbers of urban professionals are decamping to more pastoral locations; while at the same time those still locked to commuting are ever more favouring the green belt areas - why would anyone choose to live in the grim hamlets of smoggy london when they could live in welyan garden city or seven oaks?

You only need to look at some of the rather flashy charity HQ's that employ more PR people than aid workers. These have sprouted in major worldwide cities over the past decade or so. It's easy to see money is being spent on the wrong things.

There exist many truly, selfless and amazing charities out there, such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Medecins Sans Frontieres. But the vast majority really tend to get bogged down with admin, corruption and other problems.

Over the years the BBC has produced some great reporting on this:

Which is why, as a whole, I'm not sure why Government feels it's a good idea to give 0.7% of gdp to aid. Especially when so little of it is accountable.

True. It's happening. Walking along the high street in Galashiels, a Scottish border town, I counted 54 premises, 16 of which were empty. Some fashion outlets, outdoor shops and other chains along with one or two independent retailers.

That's a significant loss of frontage. The charity shops and eateries are all that's left, along with mobile phone outlets whose physical business model seems likely to be the next to suffer.

I think you mean a moral position. And I understand this. George would be fine to refuse to share a platform with anyone who has Zionist views or Nazi views or Communist views or whatever. 

The point here is that George did not ask about this kid's views; **he asked him only about his nationality**. He did not storm out after hearing his opinions; but only after hearing his place of birth/place of residence. 

That is not moral, it's discrimination, based on something a person has no control over. It's also illogical, because there are thousands of Israeli's who are anti-Israel arabs.

I wish the whole country would be like that. I think it is absolutely bloody disgusting that these little communities set up because it benefits absolutely nobody at all. The same repressive shit that went on ""back home"" for want of a better phrase carries on. The whites feel intimidated, the tax payer pays through the nose providing support for the people in these communities, you end up with people who've lived here half a century unable to speak english and suffering as a result, its all madness.

I used to work for Parcelforce as a trunk driver and their main hub was in Smethwick. I'd have a few hours a night down there waiting for the return load. Most of the staff there were black or asian and exactly as you described. Had some good friends down there. One old guy would have his missus make a large curry and he'd bring it in on a Friday night and several of us would share it and it knocked the socks off anything you'd get from a take away. 

One thing I did note and discussed with a couple is how racist some of them were. It was at the time the eastern europeans (Polish etc) had just started to come to the UK for work and some were appearing at the hub. The asian lads in particular used to give them some really quite nasty abuse. I once asked an asian lad who I spoke to every night why they were like that. I said that coming from an ethnic group which has suffered some real abuse over the years that I would've thought they were the last people who would be. His response was that a lot of asians are more racist than most white people he knew which astounded me quite frankly.

Obviously local residents adjacent to the land were not very happy about that.

I'm pretty sure they got their own way on that.  They also cleverly locked the council into a 25 year long single supplier deal which guarantees they can charge them what they want for the upkeep of countywide managed fibre network, I don't think any other suppliers were even required to tender which I'm pretty sure is illegal but hey-ho, most of the council were fucking dumb and the clever ones were paid.

I hate talking to sales people and would always choose the internet for product research and/or purchases over a bricks and mortar store.

As the experience with your wife shows, key weight is very much a matter of personal taste. Nothing you can read on the internet will tell you what it feels like to play a piano.

I spent half a day choosing my last piano, playing a selection of pieces on various different pianos in the store.  The staff were very accommodating, helping me with headphones, amps, brochures, advice, demos, etc.  And they left me alone when I just wanted to play.

I bought the piano from them in the end and they delivered it the next day (the store manager rung me three times that day to arrange a time, confirm that the piano had been put on the van, and then to let me know they were 10 minutes away).  

For service like that I would have gladly paid a bit more for the piano, but I didn't have to because they were as cheap as anyone else on the net and had a price matching promise in case they weren't.

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1293730/Somali-asylum-seeker-family-given-2m-house--complaining-5-bed-London-home-poor-area.html

&gt; A family of former asylum-seekers from Somalia are living in a £2.1million luxury townhouse in one of Britain's most exclusive addresses at a cost to taxpayers of £8,000 a month.
&gt;
&gt; Abdi and Sayruq Nur and their seven children moved into their three-storey property in a fashionable area of London last month because they didn't like the 'poorer' part of the city they were living in. 
&gt;
&gt; Mr Nur, 42, an unemployed bus conductor, and his 40-year-old wife, who has never worked, are now living in Kensington despite the fact that they are totally dependent on state benefits. 
&gt;
&gt; They live close to celebrities, including artist Lucian Freud, singer Damon Albarn and designer Stella McCartney, and their home is just minutes from the fashionable Kensington Place restaurant which was a favourite haunt of the late Princess Diana. 
&gt;
&gt; The family's new home is believed to be one of the most expensive houses ever paid for by housing benefit, which is administered by local councils but funded by the Department for Work and Pensions.
&gt;
&gt; The disclosure that a single family has been paid so much will embarrass Ministers, who last month pledged to rein in Britain's £20billion-a-year housing benefit bill. 
&gt;
&gt; Mr Nur said his former five-bedroom home in the Kensal Rise area of Brent, which cost £900 a week in housing benefit, was suitable for the family's needs but he said they had felt compelled to move because they did not like living 'in a very poor area' and were unhappy with the quality of local shops and schools. 
&gt;
&gt; He said he found the new house through a friend who knew the landlord, arranged to rent it through an estate agent, then approached officials at Kensington and Chelsea council who said 'it would be no problem' to move.
&gt;
&gt; Rules allow anyone who is eligible for housing benefit to claim for a private property in any part of the country they wish.
&gt;
&gt; The £2,000 per week is paid directly to Mr Nur and his family, who then pay their landlord.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Property sources say the house was being advertised locally at a cost of £1,050 per week.
&gt;
&gt; The house is owned by Brophy Group Business Ltd, a British Virgin Islands company whose registered address is a post office box in Liechtenstein.
&gt;
&gt; No one from the firm, which bought the house for £2.1 million in 2007, was available for comment.

When we were letting in a few academics it was OK. Now we're letting in ""unemployed bus conductors"" from Somalia and paying £2000 a week - and note the house was previously advertised for £1050 so half of that is probably unnecessary - for someone who has no intention of working (why bother when the state will pay you far more in benefits than you could ever earn) it is a huge problem.

Tell you what. Let's cut off state benefits to people like this.

doesn't matter who funds; you said Nazis got power because of outside funding and terrorism. so why aren't Al Qaeeda in power? they have both these elements. there must be more to it? 

&gt; Was it you that talking about how stupid Galloway looked? 

no. 

&gt; A viewpoint not corrupted by Likudism could see it as Galloway standing up against Israeli deceitfulness. 

this is just more discrimination justification. whether Galloway was misled or not is irrelevant; he refused to debate a certain group based on nationality. How is this justifiable? 

&gt; There's more of a hint of zionism in the words of the Israeli here

yes I'm quite sure the opponent was both a) Israeli b) Jewish and c) a Zionist. But galloway did not ask whether he was b) or c), but only a). we can all agree that refusing to debate a zionist is (if not right or sensible) at least not a form of discrimination. But refusing to debate someone based on nationality is. 

&gt;  Having watched that again, it's one thing discriminating against Israelis but we don't even know that is what is happening.

we know this is exactly what is happening, because George says ""I refuse to debate Israeli's"".

true,squigs,cnty-expat,Brighton,"Yes it is their choice, and that's the entire point. They have the right not to have sex. 

We're not talking about telling them not to have sex. Just making it very clear to them that they are the ones that should choose. Not me. Not you. All we can do is provide them as much information as possible. The fact that they have the right not to have sex, that it's their choice, that they should wait until they're ready for it are important lessons. 

Teaching girls self respect is a good thing. Teaching them that they have autonomy over their bodies is part of this. People are being so eager to read a ""sex is bad"" message into this that they'll throw out these important points and end up advocating one position without even suggesting that waiting for the right person is also a positive choice.

I get the strong feeling that any promotion of advocacy is seen as ""sex is bad"". You can promote two choices as being good, and advocate *both*.

So here are my points in bullet point form. Tell me if you disagree with any of them

 * Sex is an important issue in society and should not trivialised.
 * Teenagers are under a lot of pressure from their peer group and the media to have sex.
 * They are the ones who should choose to have sex.
 * Teenagers are still quite naive.
 * Abstinence is an acceptable choice.
 * Many teenagers regret the decision to have sex.
 * Given the above, abstinence should be promoted as an acceptable *choice*.
 * This should be *part* of a comprehensive sex education programme.
 * Kids should also be taught about contraception and prevention of STDs.

If Galloway had remained through the guy's opening comments, decided that he was espousing a Zionist position and then stated that he doesn't debate Zionists, then I might be prepared to agree with you.

Either way, I still think that refusing to debate someone is pathetic and shows up Galloway for the grandstanding prick that he is.  People like him will never be the solution to the problem, as he is extreme in his own views as those that he accuses in turn.

We live in a world where I can purchse anything (ANYTHING) in about twenty seconds flat, get it delevered the same day in most cases, and usually it will be cheaper than it is in the shop. So what do shops offer me? 

An experience. HMV is the elephant in the room here. If they'd made their shops places where you had a good, curated selection of quality, unusual and important music, staffed by people who actually cared about what they were selling, backed up by in-store performances (and hey, maybe a bar/coffee place/listening lounge) from a variety of artists (signed and unsigned, local and international, all genres), then it would be THE place for music. Then they'd need to back that up with multichannel functionality. How much effort would it have been to put a few digital download points in stores, where you could purchase a digital version of a track/album/movie, and download it to your device on the spot? 

Shops also need to use digital/online to get people in to their shops. It should be about the shopping experience, it should be fun, and hell, if I go to a shop, look at something and check on my mobile to see if it's cheaper at megamart down the road, then you send me an instant mobile offer saying ""We know you're in our shop, we know you're checking prices - we'll match them for you, whether you buy here OR through our website when you get home"". 

It's a challenge, but it isn't impossible. Smaller shops without the range need to stop competing with the big boys and emphasize the expertise and genuine 'give-a-shit-ness' that they can offer, because big chains just haven't got a handle on it yet.

I have echoed your thoughts on here regarding the sensationalist and biased reporting, its not just one story like this, there have been dozens and every time you can virtually superimpose the comments from each and find little difference in them. 

I always find it telling what the papers *don't* say. For example, statistically children from impoverished or low income families are more likely to use drugs, alcohol or be involved in crime, and also to be involved with the social services. Yet the papers do not report any of that, if it existed, it would be included in the report to show what a bad mother she was. They also make no mention if she has always been on benefits, or if she has been with partners who have worked and earned money to support the children, or if she has always been in council housing. People are quick to assume she is a bad mother, she doesn't give her children enough attention and that her children will all be brought up badly. She may well be an awful person, and all the assumptions are true, but it is still telling that people make these assumptions based on one news article, and because of the influence of previous media articles showing the same type of problem.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;  But paid to be a caregiver of your own child?

Yes. I get carers allowance for looking after my autistic son. The £3k a year, less than dole money, is nothing compared to the £20k I lost by not being able to work fulltime and having to drop the amount of work I did self employed to be able to fit in things around him. It would cost a shitload more if he were to get a specialist carer for the time I look after him in addition to what a normal child would need. He needs things which you'd not think of. For example, even though he is in secondary school next year and that school is less than 1/2 mile away from home he will need walking to and from school right up until the day he leaves at 18 because even though he knows that you stop at the kerb, look left and right to see if there's a car coming before crossing the road, there's a disconnect between seeing a car coming and knowing that means you don't cross. Age 11 he will still look to see if there is a car coming and quite happily step out into the road if there is. Its not from lack of trying - we've tried twice a day Mon-Fri for 5 years.

That one single thing alone excludes me from being able to get full time work. I'm self employed which you think would be ideal however when I go to buy stock it means I'm not back for school finishing time so unless I can get someone to pick him up then I can't go buy stock. When I post things I sometimes have to use the post office which costs me twice as much as a courier, a cost I have to stand myself, if I can't find someone to wait in for the collection. Quite often during the middle of the day I have to go to school to collect him or to go to a SEN meeting. The increase in care he's needed this year has had such an impact on my business my profits for 2012-2013 are looking at like being nearly 75% lower than 2012-2013.

true,not_shakey_byrne,,Leeds - GSXR1000k7 / Duc 996,"I'm in Leeds and got my bike shipped over from ""crossan motorcycles"" in N. Ireland.

I felt it was a bit risky because it meant I was effectively buying the bike unseen other than photos. Not something I'd normally entertain. They assured me that the bike was exactly as described and if I found anything wrong with it then I could send it straight back in the first 10days or they'd pay for the problem to be fixed.

The people who actually took the delivery from Liverpool docks to Leeds were absolute dickheads. It was on a pallet and the guy was  just like ""doesn't fit on my rear lift. If you've not got a forklift at the delivery address you'll have to come and collect it from us other side of Leeds"". Basically some mates and I untied it off pallet and carry it onto the rear lift that the guy grudging operated - wouldn't lift a finger to help us get it off the pallet and was just generally a nob.

The bike itself was mint, exactly as described. However all the documents that were suppose to be ""attached to the bike"" weren't there - V5, MOT cert, service history all that sort of thing. I phoned crossan who did a bit of too-ing and fro-ing their end insisting it had been on the bike when it left them. Eventually it turned out the docs were still there, they apologised and they got shipped over about 3days later by recorded delivery.

I also realised I only had one key, so there was a Suzuki encoded key for my bike floating about - something i wasn't happy with. They said they'd get in touch with the P/O but it might take a while. About a month later I got a phone call they'd located the key and it was again posted out to me.

That actually sounds like it was a real hassle but in reality the person I spoke about the bike and when i had the problems was honest and simply admitted when they had made a mistake and genuinely seems to be making an effort to sort out the issues. I never got the impression i was being lied to or fobbed off. Mistakes do happen but I think you learn a lot more about a business when you see how they go about sorting them, and in this regard crossan were actually really good. I'd have no bones about using them again.

An ad hominem attack is where I personally abuse someone. If I paint them into a corner in a polite debate where they are forced to expose their own prejudices, then that is clever debating, not personal insults.

An example - I once debated a gay issues with a fundamentalist who supported the use of ""gay cures"" because gays needed to be drawn towards Jesus etc.

After a while of making sure the man was strongly advocating the supremacy of Christianity as the cure for anyone not following the teachings of Jesus...

I simply asked quietly and calmly if he would seek to ""cure"" Jews as well.

Not really. There's entire towns in the UK that don't have many chain shops and are all small local producers and sellers. There's one where my grandma lives that's literally got one Costa coffee, and that's closing.

It's all down to careful council planning and listening to what the residents actually want.

There is an argument for convenience, but you're either going to walk into town or drive to a supermarket anyway, and so putting the supermarket far away from the town maintains the convenience of having one, but doesn't suck the life out of the town, it's shops and the services it provides. It actually forces the supermarket to be competitive too, because people really have to want to go there since they can easily walk to a local small seller and get something cheap anyway.

In the UK the pyramid is becoming more top-heavy. The majority of people cease to be economically productive in their mid-60s and from then on only consume. Even people with good pensions are a net drain after that, So we need GDP and public funds to care for their health and so on. Without more working people, either the level of care for the elderly must go down, or the tax on the working individuals must go up. Neither of those are desirable.  

If, as you seem to be suggesting, we reduced our birth rate and immigration of workers, then this would exacerbate what is already a time-bomb.  

We are not going to run out of food in the near future. We need to secure long-term energy supplies, and there is pressure on housing in the South East. However if we can deal with these problems, then we should use the extra capacity for a bigger young population.

Guitar strings, tuners, etc are still selling, but the big-ticket items (basically anything over £100), where the bulk of the profit lies, are barely selling.

From a personal, anectodal perspective, the government is partly responsible - public sector workers (in creative-type positions) and private creative industries that rely on funding make up a key portion of our customers. Disproportionately, they are finding jobs/hours/wages cut.

(I will mention - small business rates relief, started by Labour three or four years ago but still continued by this government are VERY VERY important. Working tax credits, too, are a big help when times are tough)

The council is also *desperate* to get the big companies to move in (some councils pay shops like Waitrose to open, as well as giving them rent relief). It feels like they are offering help and incentives to those companies, whilst ignoring the smaller shops - even though independent retailers are an integral, and very popular part of our town's economy and culture. Many people who visit either do so for the small shops, or remark very positively on them.

&gt; How does River Song discharge her weapon pack? 

She apparently knows that Doctor is going to die at Lake Silencio, as just before she is kidnapped and taken to the lake, she is going over ""the last eye witness testimonials"" meaning that she knows. After that, I'd expect she'd pull some kind of Doctor-esque stunt to hack the astronaut suit.

&gt; Why does her not killing the Doctor cause all of time and space to happen at once? 

Because Doctor never actually didn't die at that point, the whole universe just thought it did.

&gt; Why were there no Reapers ripping everything to shreds? 

[Reapers live in Time Vortex and try to find paradoxes to ""sterilise""](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Reaper). It might be just pure luck that they didn't show up this time -- maybe eventually they would show up. I know this is kind of weak explanation.

&gt; If River Song’s memory is wiped after she kills the Doctor, why does she know what she’s done in the ‘Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone’ story? 

I can't remember or find any reference to memory wipe either in [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Song_(Doctor_Who\)) nor [TARDIS Data Core article](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/River_Song).

The one you can always count on is Scallywags at Yonge and St Clair East. When you get out of St Clair East station it's west of Yonge on St Clair on the south side of the street. Probably about 30 steps from the intersection. On the 3rd floor is where the Toronto Chelsea FC Supporters Club meets for every match. They typically show every game. Food is available but the service is meh. It has gotten better over the years though.

The vibe at Scallywags can get really awesome on the 3rd floor especially during big games, so I'd recommend that first.

As for the downtown core, you have a few options that I used while I lived at U of T. At Yonge and St Mary's (about 2 blocks south of Bloor on the east side of the street) you have Duke of Gloucester. That pub is mostly an Arsenal/United pub, but they typically show most big matches regardless of who is playing. It was my fall back for most Champion's League matches since it was pretty close to campus. You get a wide variety of supporters that come out but the overall vibe is friendly as most people are coming to watch the football.

On the south side of campus you have O'Grady's, Molly Blooms and Einsteins. They're all on College Street right on the border of campus. You're gonna end up getting drunk there at some point anyway. I've seen a few games there sometimes, but never went there regularly.

Near the ACC you have Real Sports which is the mecca of all sports bars. I watched the Champion's League final there (May 19, 2012, never forget). They will only show the really big matches and stuff like the Euros/World Cup. It's worth going just to experience the bar, so why not go when we're playing? You can call ahead and ask them if they'll have the match on their giant 2 storey screen so you know it's worth the trip.

I hope that helps. I'm not in the country atm as I'm studying abroad but I'm happy to answer any questions.

You could argue that people from other countries might not fully understand the north london rivalry, but people still understand the concept of a rivalry.  Red sox fans would rather see the Yankee stadium explode than see them win. 

&gt;It's the Dempsey loving (despite him being awful) bunch of yanks that have ruined this subreddit.

As a yank and long time supporter, who has been critical of demspey from the beginning (I still think Siggy, now, Holtby should be starting), I only take umbrage with the fact that the subreddit is ""ruined"".  Large numbers usually bring in a lot of shit people.  We have a fair share of rival fans who subscribe and downvote the shit out of things, or come in and troll.

I just don't understand how you can think that you would have been upvoted, even from reasonable people, coming into a spurs specific subreddit and say that you are rooting for arsenal, a team who is four points behind us in the table, and could potentially spoil our CL dreams.

its a systemic problem, its not about loads of money, but feeling good about yourself and self worth.

I wonder (now going to be very un-pc) if this will get worse, I waited till I could afford my kids, and can afford 2 (I could afford another easily) but don't want any more as we are getting older as parents and don't want that pain again.. Anyways..  In the time my kids have kids I suspect that a 'feckless' family would have 2 generations of multiple kids that would carry on the chain.

Something has to give at some point?

Note, to add, but my wife comes from a poor area outside of Glasgow and lived in council accommodation all her life, and she did break away and go to uni.. So I do KNOW it is possible, but I think the lack of respect wanting to brake out has changed now most of her and her pals all wanted to get out.

It starts with the building of retail ""parks"" which are typically one massive supermarket from one of the big 4, and then lots of larger warehouse style retail outlets around them, free parking and so on are entirely counter productive to the high street.  These get built because the retail giants offer cash strapped councils incentives; ""let us build a kilometer long Tesco store and 10,000 space car park here and we'll fund and manage the required rebuilding, signage, surfacing and a couple of years maintenance of the surrounding road system"" and the council, who otherwise couldn't afford anything of the sort say, ""Yes, that sounds entirely reasonable"".

Retail parks kill high streets.  The stores on high streets cannot compete on pricing with multi-national retail giants who buy in enormous bulk quantites at huge discounts and thereby sell for less.  Retail parks have lower business rates per square foot than high streets but only offer massive buildings so again smaller retailers are trapped on high streets paying higher rates and gaining lower revenues.  Councils set rates and also parking charges which are non-existent on most retail parks and often ridiculously high in town centres.  The knock on effect of this; high streets die.

The other knock on: councils have to make up that short fall in rates and car parking charges that they aren't getting from the town centre anymore becuase the retail giants with their free car-park spaces on the edge of town have negotiated a fixed business rate for 10-25 years which, in a time of ever increasing costs, means their real time expenditure on rates goes down over the years and the councils income on these sites becomes correspondingly lower.  So what tax do they increase to pay for the services they, by law, have to provide?

Yup, council tax.  So you and I end up subsidising Tesco and co.

No other country in the modern world is subjected to repeated attempts of annihilation, and open threats against it from most of its neighbours.

&gt; It's a nebulous pseudo-legal demand that no international law caters for, and it was dreamt up as a means of destroying the negotiating process

Nonsense. International law provides for the right of nations to exist through several mechanisms such as the right to self-determination, immutability of sovereign affairs, right to self-defense, prohibition of use of force in aggression and the duty of pacific resolution of conflicts. These are all primary, established and non-controversial principles which are reflected in normative law.

&gt; in face of international consensus that Israel has committed war crimes

Commission of war crimes is a question of fact, not opinion. All your neighbours may think you are committing a crime by parking *your* car in the public spot because they envy your bank account. That does not make it in fact a crime, even if they call it a consensus and demand the police investigates it. 

&gt; you may not grab land in times of war, you may not change the ethnic demographics by imposition.

You may not grab land *that you do not have a previous title to* in times of war, and you may not change the ethnic demographics in *specific prohibited manner*.

It's a weapon, albeit a blunt one.  I'd rather pull the road lobby apart from the top down.  And build alternative transport schemes from the bottom up.

true,hoodie92,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"Correct, there are plenty of Israeli Arabs, Christians, atheists, and almost any other religion you can think of.

However, to answer your original question:

Zionism was originally a term used for people who believed that Israel should be a refuge for Jews. It was a term for people whose final goal was to have Israel as a Jewish state. That is why the word is fairly redundant. It is why almost no Jews or Israelis use it. 95% of the time I hear it used, it is in an offense or ignorant way, for example: ""The Zionist controllers of American media..."". 

Israeli is a person with an Israeli citizenship. There are Israelis of many faiths, not just Jewish. Just as all Italians aren't Roman Catholic, not all Israelis are Jews.

A Jew is a person belonging to the Jewish faith, a religion.

&gt;and why is 'Israeli' not the same as 'Jew'?

Because I am a British Jew, with a British passport, and British parents. I have visited Israel only twice in my life, for holiday. I do not agree with the majority of its foreign policies. Just as a British Muslim is not responsible for a suicide bombing in Afghanistan, so am I not responsible for the actions of the state of Israel.

Now you know.

(Hopefully) your questions were not intended to be malicious. The problem is, many, many people do not know the difference, and this ignorance leads to many problems.

-It has only surveyed a very small, partial section of the prison estate, and it has not sampled scientifically

-A number of its categories are VERY subjectively defined, and the definitions are not made clear in the headline stats (""Decency"" and ""operational effectiveness"")

-Giving only the fact that X number of prisons have better than average reoffending rates is, quite frankly, highly disengenuous.  This is NOT saying that private prisons have, on average, lower reoffending rates. 

Lets take that 7 out of 10 on short terms sentences. Of those 7 prisons, by and large they are only a couple of % points better or fewer.  The best case is a 5.5% improvement. 

However in 2 out of the 3 that are worse, they are a full TEN OR ELEVEN points worse. One of these is Ashfield Male Juvenile prison (Stephen Fry's old stomping ground), where the reoffending rate is nearly 80%.

This is particularly acute in the case of Public Protection. Yes, 7 out of 12 are performing better. However those performing better are generally only performing a little better, while some of the weaker private sector prisons are performing much, much worse. Adding the figures together the private prisons perform an average of 0.21 points WORSE overall, which is about 10%

Presenting the figures as they have, in my opinion, intentionally obfuscates the issue. It would not have hurt them to present overall figures as well.

 In fact I think the overall figures would still have come out slightly in their favour on reofending, it just wouldn't have presented so compelling a case. Personally I think when you have vulnerable people's entire existences on the line, trying to muddle the issue on the basis of ideology is somewhat indecent.

Basically, they are taking public ally available data, reordering it selectively to meet their perspective, and then adding it to a large amount of polemic that is not justified even by the selective facts they are trying to ground it in.

I was reading some of your other comments in this thread and I see that you are an advocate of bringing in some 2 bit striker named falcao (joke).  While i agree that falcao its a phenomenal (i don't use that word lightly) talent, i just don't think its the right move for the club.

As you obviously know, we've gotten burned on expensive strikers in the post couple years, to the tune of 100+ million (plus 200k wages).  If spending 50 mill on strikers has worked 0/2 in the past, why try it a 3rd time? It doesn't make sense.  It especially doesn't make sense when you account for FFP.  Think about this: uefa/fifa/whoever is in charge of anything FFP is taking it seriously, to the point of not allowing teams to compete in Europe if they don't comply with the rules.  The rules, in my vague terms, basically say your checkbook had to balance.
So spending 70 mill on players like we did this summer is ok, because we got all of that money from winning the CL.  This year, its unlikely we will win anything, although a top 4 finish is quite likely.  I know Romans person pockets are deep, but i still can't see the justification in spending another 50+ mill.

I'm looking forward to your response.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"These are problems with the way in which you deliver aid, not the principle of aid itself. 

If you look at the sort of thing DFID funds, for instance [in Ethiopia](http://projects.dfid.gov.uk/Default.aspx?countrySelect=ET-Ethiopia), which has had a couple of recent famines, and which has the highest recent DFID budget, you'll see that even there, famine relief is a pretty minor part of what they spend their money on. And the money which is spent on famine relief, is mostly spent on trying to improve food production assets, far more than dumping grain from Western surplusses.

A majority of the total budget is spent on trying to improve basic services, and improve governance, and even beyond altruism, it's clear that this has serious benefits for us. Ethiopia is a country which shares enormous land borders with Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan and Kenya, and which has a very large Muslim population. If Ethiopia does well, it reduces the risk of extremism, reduces the demands of migration to Western countries, and provides a bulwark and strategic asset for helping to stabilize the surrounding area. Somalia in particular has been seriously disrupting world trade through piracy in the Gulf of Aden.

And Ethiopia has been an enormous recent success. Over the last ten years, its economy has been growing at [between 7 and 11%](https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_kd_zg&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:ETH&amp;ifdim=region&amp;ind=false), and over the last twenty years, its child mortality rate has massively fallen, and its fertility rate also. At the current rate of change, [child mortality](https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=sh_dyn_mort&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:ETH:GBR&amp;ifdim=region&amp;ind=false) and [fertility](https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_tfrt_in&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:ETH:GBR&amp;ifdim=region&amp;ind=false) will be down to Western rates within twenty years. It's hard to overstate what an enormous humanitarian success this is; millions of lives will be saved, and millions of lives will be improved beyond comparison. Clearly, this has been done mostly by Ethiopians, but I think we play a vital role in helping their government to find the correct model to deliver infrastructure and basic services, and to pay some of the costs.

The Ethiopian government has also played a key role in supporting, through the African Union, the democratic government of Somalia, and fighting back against Al-Shabaab, which is an extremely nasty, salafist regime, directly affiliated with Al-Qaeda, and which supports the piracy previously mentioned.

Frankly, this is a paragon of exactly how our money should be spent. For the amount we spent in Afghanistan (£17bn), we could pay for the Ethiopian aid budget (£200m) for 85 years. That budget directly pays to:

&gt; support 2 million children to go to primary school, provide 7.5 million people with access to basic health care, help half a million women give birth safely, provide an additional three quarters of a million women with access to family planning and provide an additional 1.4 million people with clean drinking water 

And provides governance benefits which outweigh this many times over, and eventually render aid unnecessary.

Although there have sadly been some abuses of employee rights, the majority of labourers are treated ok. They are underpaid, I agree, but confiscating passports is illegal and punishable with three years in prison. It is rare for it to happen, especially in 2013. 

I work with labourers in Dubai all the time and the reality is that these are simply hard-working guys from poor backgrounds, saving some money to send home to their families. I know that is less sensational than the tabloid news reports saying they are all oppressed slaves but that is the mundane truth. 

If it was as bad as you say, why would thousands of workers come to Dubai every year, sometimes on their third or fourth contract? Surely the first few over would say to their friends and family, ""Guys, it is a scam! They lied about the pay and now I am stuck here. Don't come!"" But that doesn't happen. More come all the time and then renew their contract to come back again.

I agree they should be paid more but look at it from their perspective. Earning $300 a month sucks but it is better than earning $0 a month in a shanty town. This isn't enough of course and I hope the UAE government introduce a minimum wage soon.

We are a democracy and as such must carry out the will of the people, regardless of the notion that you, and I, know it to be wrong. We are not authoritarians and thus cannot deny the people the service THEY want. The debate should be trying to spend as little as possible on it so we can spend effectively.

I never at any point suggested a healthcare based on pill popping. I believe that the NHS right under is a bloated creature, there is a lot of trust for the government in this whole AMA but they do not manage services well. Not being run effectively does not ensure good quality care, it ensures waste, levels upon levels of bureacracy and mismanagement of an obscene nature. Speak to anyone who works in or has worked with the NHS and they will confidently tell you a way of how money could so obviously saved. Streamling, waste cutting and power redistribution can go hand in hand with greater quality of care that will last for the generation. The NHS can be so much more than the dying beast it is.

With regard to being in the pocket of drug companies, I'm afraid you are simply misinformed. The Labour administration had all GP's have a constant stock of a whole host of drugs that would be thrown out due to them not being used for too long. A Tory proposal is for GP's to order more specific drugs in as and when they need. Tell me now which system benefits the drug companies.

We are not in the pocket of anyone. We are backed up by individual donations from a cross spectrum of society, rich and poor. The cash for policy allegations have affected both the Tories and Labour and both have not caved in.

Still have to wonder if Real would be ready to chase AVB yet (i hope not) his success at Porto is the big note on his CV aside from that he got fired from Chelsea (wrongly in my opinion but to our benefit not going to gripe about it) and has had a good season with a team that isn't in the CL.  

Don't get me wrong, i don't see any of this as a negative and i am quite happy to keep AVB for the foreseeable future but Real Madrid (like it or not) one of the most massive clubs on the planet and while i think AVB makes sense for them you have to wonder if Real would want someone who is (compared to Jose) relatively unproven.  I would imagine they would chase a bigger name to replace Jose.

Now, AVB may not want to move, he may want to stick out his contract or stay at WHL for his whole career or not go to a team where his mentor just left so he can make his own name. Regardless none of the fans would actually have any clue would be my guess.

The instructor kept on forgetting to teach me shit like how to change gears. Luckily I'd YouTubed ""how to ride a motorcycle"" before I went, but still.

One thing I couldn't do was U-turns, and lacked confidence massively. The instructor kept on effing and blinding saying how easy they were. After a while, he just gave up, and even now I feel apprehensive about U-turns haha.

The funniest part of my CBT was the road ride. The instructor I had was really sarky. Considering this is the FIRST DAY ON A BIKE, a bit of positivity is always good. I forgot my lifesaver once as did the other CBT learner I was with and I hear this drawling bored voice in my earpiece ""...*neither of you did a lifesaver. WHY do I even BOTHER. WHAT'S THE POINT. Ugh. Great. No lifesaver. Amazing. I might as well quit my job*""

I thought ""fuckin' hell chap, I'm sorry!"" and let it slide, but it got worse. We approached a roundabout which I was unfamiliar with and he instructed us to got 3/4. I counted the exits, but must have fucked up because I left one too soon. Entirely my mistake. Until I hear ""*...Ugh... Snackasaurus, well done, [I can't believe you've done this.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X6VoFBCE9k) This is the WORST day EVER, I can't believe what I have to put up with. Fantastic. WHAT'S THE POINT.*"" and all this moaning. 

My blood starts to boil, but I let it settle. The instructor calls for a break so we pull over. As we dismount I say to him ""ah mate, I'm really sorry for screwing up on the roundabout, I didn-"" ""Yeah well if you'd LISTENED PROPERLY you'd have not screwed up. Great isn't it. Just grea-"" at which point I *FLIPPED*. 

I shouted at him in monologue for a good few minutes, saying how if he's gonna be sarky with me after I've forked over £130 I'm gonna leave my bike there on the roadside and take my CBT elsewhere where they actually try and TEACH the students.

Made for a VERY awkward rest of the ride. The other CBT guy on a scooter was some scratty 17 year old who just kept silent.

true,SamLeeLee,null,null,"We are in a strange economic situation in the United Kingdom. Our debt is enormous like any other nations but our behavior as a country prior to the crash and immediately after entails how we can behave now. With most any problem, the Labour government would throw money at it, so by 2008 as a nation we were already spending an incredibly large amount of money, in a lot of areas needlessly and in a lot of areas not efficiently. The Keynesian philosophy of Labour during the crash was that we should encourage spending to get the economy back on its feet again, but we were already spending and confidence was at rock bottom. As such Brown's administration sent the debt skyrocketing, with interest spiraling higher day by day. The philosophy was that we should ignore it and let new generations fix it, because by then they'll have to, the deficit would be so huge by then that the only way out would be vast vast vast cuts, with the only real nation to compare to in 2013 being Greece.

Conservative Party austerity means dealing with the deficit now, bringing it down over the next few years. Streamlining, making more efficient and improving the quality of the public sector whilst encouraging growth in the private sector. What is not mentioned in the public debate is how strangled the private sector was, how little investment there was. Germany during times were good invested heavily in it's industry, in its own private sector, it's own free market while Blair relied entirely on public sector expansion and foreign imports to plug the gap. What we see now is us having to cut back on the bloated public sector while Germany has a comfortable nest egg. The Tories have to make a great number of difficult choices when cutting, it is never pleasant knowing that people lives will be adversely affected, but the private sector can recuperate to help and we can set up a more sustainable system for the future. The line of ""We wouldn't be in this mess if it weren't for Labour"" is repaeted often, and that is because their mismanagement was so disastrous that many Conservatively minded people believe they should never be trusted with the economy again, Keynesianism for Britain now means waste and debt.
