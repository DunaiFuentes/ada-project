Redknapp's illness and jockeying for England last season helped that. This season though they look really good, they've got depth and a focused manager. Their only problems are probably their malfunctioning strikers. Defoe and Adebayor are having fairly poor seasons. Their midfield in holding them up. Injuries in that area would be hard to recover from.
Then there's Newcastle, they've strengthened quite well in the last window, adding players with CL experience. So they might be in decent shape.

Our biggest advantage is that our form tends to be indifferent to our CL games due to the experience we had in the competitions but those teams are growing in experience as well so we're gonna have to make our own luck.

true,Uniform764,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"In many cases I'd agree, the slippery slope argument is an easy fallback, but in this case I think it bears some weight. 

In Britain we, rightly, have legislation that prevents ""discrimination in the provision of goods, facilities, services, education and public functions"", based on several protected characteristics, race, gender, religion, sexual orientation etc. 

Right now gay couples cannot get married in the CofE (to pick the biggest opposition religion in this country) because same sex marriage is not legal. It is specifically defined as between a man and a woman in law. If this bill passes, then they won't be able to get married in the CofE because the CofE doesn't want them to. That shifts the discrimination from being an issue of out national laws, to being an issue with a specific organisation. Suddenly the CofE has an opt out from a major piece of equality legislation. Why does the CofE get to opt out and other organisations do not?

Given that most of the argument for legalising gay marriage is that homosexuals wish to be treated equally, and that we have legislation specifically preventing discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, I honestly do not think that this ""please both parties"" approach, whereby gay marriage would be legal but churches can still refuse to marry gay people is a viable options. Either it should be legal, or it should not. There is no viable middle ground, in my opinion at least. 

The correct answer may well be to be to force the church to acknowledge gay marriage, in which case surely we should put it in the bill being voted on tomorrow?

Like I said in another post or two, I personally don't have any issue with gay marriage, but I do think it's a more contentious and complicated issue that we would like it to be .

Re the registrar refusal, like you I'd say ""it's your job get on with it"", I'd have never thought of the issue.

* Was revered by both the team and the fans. 

* Had Chelsea sitting at first until a series of unfortunate results. Yes that's what they were, unfortunate results, with a dip in form that almost every team sees, let a lone a team in transition with very little outfield experience.

* Managed to keep Chelsea scoring with goals from the midfield and defence even though we had only one match fit striker in the squad and even got Torres scoring for a while

* Was knocked out of the Champions League on the last game of the group stages in a group that had Juventus, who had an unbeaten streak for many games and Champions of a League (a good indicator of strength of the team regardless of the League) and Shaktar Donetsk, who after a massive series of truly inspired buys, played a lot of  great attacking, lightning speed Football and his us on the counter when we weren't paying attention.

* Whose only main issue was defensive coverage on the wings when either Hazard, Mata and Oscar were in too advanced of a position to be arsed to track back properly. 

* With no control over the transfer policy, as it was known he was not going to be permanent, managed to find an attacking balance with three players who normally play a number 10 (in behind the strikers). 

* Was one of the best midfielders Chelsea has ever seen and gained the respect from fans all over the premier league.

* Who was used as a stop gap and completely fucked over by our inept managerial hierarchy after he failed to secure a champions league spot... even though we were still in strong contention for many titles.

* Who won Chelsea's ever Champions League by realising the strengths and weaknesses of the squad, of which they were many, and adjusting play so that we beat Barcelona and Bayern Munich to secure it. I don't care what anyone says, he was a manager from a Chelsea background who enabled Chelsea to put their name on the famed trophy.   

I will not stop talking about RDM, because it is the worst parts of your history that should always be fully investigated in order to stop the the past repeating itself in the future.    

The only bad thing I will say about him was his inability to change a game with a great substitution and often did not take into consideration the physicality of the Premier League, which at the beginning wasn't an issue until the referees would not give us many fouls for being manhandled.

As for those already married, the existing partner would also have to give consent.

Rose would never truly have been able to be an equal, because he would always have been able to hold so much over her.

Secondly it's the fact that at least to some extent he wants companions for the attention, yes to humanise him as well, but like 11 says ""I'm up here being cleaver and no one is around to watch, what is the point of having you all."" Rose was very much the admirer, I truly think that if 10 had gone dark side Rose would have essentially become Lucy Saxon.(Feel free to disagree, but this is a woman willing to risk destroying two universes to get back to a guy who'll outlive her, after he explicitly told her not to. They started building the dimension cannon before the Daleks started stealing planets.) This also can fit into the whole power imbalance, with her putting him on a pedestal. 

And little side note that irked me,  10 was weirdly obsessed with her(Rose with him as well), one of the reasons I feel so bad for Martha was because he never shut up about Rose in front of her. Go to New Earth ""I came here with Rose,"" fight witches ""Rose would know what to do."" Hell, he completely ignored the fact that Rose would have used the Dimension Cannon whether the universe had been falling apart or not, even though he told her punching through could destroy both universes. Obsession just sort of freaks me out in general.    

Some people cite age, but honestly it's consenting adults and I don't really care; granted 19 is probably like a child in his perspective so I can see how people would think it is a bit creepy as well.

And  for Buffy/Angel being creepy? Because it was so emotionally destructive to both parties and they kept holding on to it, even though they were smart(they did pretty much keep telling each other) enough to know better. At least they knew their relationship was screwed up.

They had rugby union star Martin Johnson on chatting about how much of a 49ers fan he is, and giving analysis on a sport he's never played.

Which is the key word. Rail is a technology proven to be highly effective for mass transit of people and freight, a capacity which we running out of, if we have not already so done. £32bn is a lot for the government to be spending speculatively on potential new technologies - that's (largely) private industry's job.

Let us not also forget that this is *not* £32bn they have burning a hole in their pocket. This is £2bn a year which they have earmarked to spend on improving rail infrastructure in the UK, and if the project doesn't go ahead, that money will more or less disappear into the ether.

But I think they should be spending it on other infrastructure in general.  I personally think that money would have been better placed in building several nuclear power stations which we need as most of our coal stations come to the end of their life (regardless of if the fuel runs out). 

Now the reason they are funding the HS 2 is because England's problem at the moment is that all its power and money comes from London, by building HS 2 they are trying to connect the rest of the country, starting with Birmingham, so Birmingham can start to grow first then connect Leeds and Nottingham so they can start to grow as well.",0,1359976084,null,0,false,0,c892nw4,t3_17uzc3,t1_c892nw4,t3_17uzc3,null,1431179050,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Bottom line is that CBS will have priority access to multi-layered redundant power that would be unfeasible for the hundred or so foreign broadcasters to all have for themselves as well, so they'll just cut into the CBS TX feed until power can be restored to their facilities.

Personally, I would rather see 'marriage' or 'civil unions' completely outlawed and replaced with a sheet of paper on which you can nominate a person or persons that you allow to see you in hospital, take over your estate and so on (and all the other legal rights) that you file with the government. Or, perhaps, a solicitor as with a Will.

This sidesteps the issue of unions totally, non-traditional or otherwise which, in a perfect world, would have no government involvement whatsoever. Our present problems stem from traditional church involvement in law and our government's previous wish to encourage 'traditional families.'

My view of government is that it should adapt to society and work within those ever changing parameters, and that it has no right to enforce or otherwise promote one way of life over another, insofar as those ways of life harm no one else and do not infringe on anyone else's basic rights to live how they want.

I am a rational pragmatist, I base things on efficiency, productivity and the balance of freedoms. I do not consider 'moral' arguments because any rational moral argument can be placed within the framework of the balance of freedoms and what is most productive for society, such as the 'golden rule' which can be argued from a purely rational standpoint.

For anyone else interested here's a reasonably clear explanation from Wikipedia's [Legal Fiction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_fiction#Resignation_from_Parliament) page:

&gt;Another legal fiction involves resignation from Parliament in the United Kingdom. In 1623 a rule was declared that said that Members of Parliament were given a trust to represent their constituencies, and therefore were not at liberty to resign them. In those days, Parliament was relatively weak in comparison to the 21st century, and service was sometimes considered a resented duty rather than a position of power and honour. However, an MP who accepted an ""office of profit"" from the Crown (including appointment as a minister) was obliged to leave the House and seek re-election, it being feared that his independence was compromised if he were in the King's pay. Therefore, the device was invented that the MP who wished to quit applied to the King for the post of ""steward of the Chiltern Hundreds"" or ""Steward of the Manor of Northstead"" with no duties or income, but legally an office of profit in the King's gift nonetheless. The first MP to avail himself of the Chiltern Hundreds to leave Parliament was John Pitt in 1751. The requirement for ministerial re-election has been abolished, but the ""Chiltern Hundreds"" mechanism has been retained to enable MPs to resign.",0,1359979129,null,0,false,0,c892ypj,t3_17v00d,t1_c892ypj,t1_c892v49,null,1431179200,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,StellaLux,smith,Smith,"I like River, she's probably my second favourite female character of all time.

1) She knows the absolute worst he can be, there is a reason that she said they were both psychopaths at the end of The Angels Take Manhattan. He has had these tendencies for absolute destruction since the Time War ended, and a few before said war(Remembrance of the Daleks anyone?). Her entire life is the product of every bad decision he has ever made, which she pretty much says straight to his face at Demon's Run, and then proceeds to show him that she still loves him. 

2) The very fact she got past her programming. People call her obsessed,which at the beginning at least is very true. But when your entire life was forced to revolve around killing a guy you might have some sort of weird obsession with him. I don't believe she feel in love with him in Let's Kill Hitler*, I think she saw that there was far more to him than a ruthless monster. She made a choice about herself maybe really for the first time in her life, she chose not to be the weapon she was made to be. 

*I think she fell in love with him through her research(stories are a reoccurring theme in Moffat's writing), and we have no idea what he whispered to her in Berlin. And let's face it, a flirty cleaver guy walks into your life, and is pretty much in love with you. Like River says ""you don't know what that does to a girl."" Melody was not mature and probably wouldn't see that as weird; she was probably like 40 in Berlin assuming she was running around since 1970 before she got to Leadworth in the 90's, but emotionally she was like 15.

3)She's not really a companion. Which I think is one of the best things she has going for her. She has her own life outside of him, she outgrew the obsession that came as an after effect of the brainwashing(I said on a different post I find obsession creepy, well she got past it). She's a professor, she has her own career that she's awesome at, a career that the Doctor thinks is stupid by the way.  

4)She is character development artistry. How often do you get to watch a persons character development out of order, while watching a show in order? Plus it's always fun to watch in her order and watch Amy and the Doctors development in backwards order. She went from a weapon, to a person, to a doctor, to a professor; and got away from having her entire life chained to the Doctor. 

Personally I feel the only reason people think her life is all about him, is because unless he's there as well, there isn't much of a reason for her to be on screen having nothing to do with the plot, it is Doctor Who after all, not Doctor Song. I would love to see her off on her own adventures in spin off media though. 

5)I'm a sucker for well done tragedy. Falling in love with someone even after knowing how, where, and when they are going to die? That's brutal. River has the worse end of the stick though, kill guy, find that he's actually maybe less of a monster than she was raised to think, burn off what could be a few thousand years of life to bring him back pretty much just to find out, then having an out of order relationship that ends with you dying in front of him without him actually knowing you. Hell, River exists because she dies in the Library rather than him, not to mention that he had a detrimental effect on her entire family. 

I know people complain about her being a Mary-sue or something.The thing is Mary-sue litmus test is designed for literature, not television. Most TV characters fail(which is weird when the original test for a Mary-sue was how much of a self-insert character a character was). In fact the Doctor, Jack and Rory all fail the test with all the traits people have added to the ""What Makes a Mary-sue"" list(but they're men so it's okay or something /s).

I think plenty can be done with her, but like I said I'd like to see it more in spin off media where she's off doing her own thing, maybe with occasional Doctor cameos(not necessary though). The occasional TV story doesn't hurt either, but give me more than one book or some radio dramas damn it!

true,Pikul,lfc87,null,"Poor error of judgement from Reina for that goal, Aguero was running away from goal with Skrtel covering him and was even signalling to Reina telling him to get back. It's not the first time he's done that, he did it earlier in the season but to good effect as he knocked the ball out for a throw of corner I believe, I'm trying to remember what match it was but I simply can't. I remember him doing once or twice in previous seasons too and not getting caught out. It's a pretty wtf moment to see your keeper race from the goal line like that.

Our Goalkeeper situation is a tough one. What I'd like to see happen is we bring in a relatively young but experienced keeper and have both himself and Reina compete for the number one spot, if Reina's form doesn't improve, then we sell him. Part of Reina's slip in form, I believe, has been lack of competition for his spot for the last few seasons and maybe having a very good second keeper might spur him on a bit. Of course there's a risk involved here as Reina's price could drop further if there's no improvement. Another contributing factor to his slip is his favoured Goalkeeping coach Xavi Valero being let go when Hodgson arrived, which I believe Reina was upset by.

A Goalkeeper along with a new centre-back should be priority in the summer and I believe it will be as the midfield and forward line have been strengthened considerably compared to last season.

While I mildly dislike her, I wholeheartedly enjoy the way the other characters interact with her.  In my mind, that makes her an excellent character.  

A character's worth can't be based on how much you like a character, as the two are entirely different.  The value of a character comes in how much they contribute to the development and progression of the story.  While that's not the only thing that gives them value, it's the one that I believe is most important.

Hazard - £35m

Oscar - £28m

Moses - £10m

Marin - £7m

Azpilicueta - £7m



And the only revenue received was £8.8m from Raul Meireles. However you could also look at there was some high earning players released in Drogba and lesser so in Kalou and Bosingwa as well as the loan of Essien. However, the drop in wage budget in Drogba alone is probably close to that of what Hazard earns (admittedly I haven't checked that one) and when you look at the players brought the wage bill probably hasn't changed that much either positively or negatively. So all in all, over the summer there was a net spend of about £80m. I don't like doing stuff like this because I start to feel like I'm a Liverpool fan when calculating net spend.

If anything it would probably be more accurate to say that money was spent in the wrong places, but that's not what you were asking so I won't delve into it here. Young yes, potentially cheaper? Maybe not.

I don't think FFP is having that much of an impact, but maybe the summer was just a one off and won't be repeated again. Top clubs will have so many lawyers looking into loopholes I can't see it being that big of a deal.

First of all, to clear the air - I never used the Mary Sue litmus test on River (mostly because I hate that thing for being a sum of personal opinions which someone then tried to pass off as absolute law). My calling her a Mary Sue is strictly my own personal impression of her and can therefore just as easily be correct or dead wrong. I suppose the main MS 'vibe' I get from her is the sheer fact that Moffat loves her so much to the point where he tries to force her on the audience as much as possible. For the longest time Doctor Who wasn't Doctor Who, it was 'The Story of River Song'. This was of course brilliant if you were lucky enough to like River, but you can see how it can be hell if you don't.

I do agree it is an amazing twist that we got to see her story in reverse, it is not something I ever even thought of before. But here's the thing I dislike (or possibly don't get) - why does the show keep claiming that the Doctor is in love with River? We've seen no proof of that, the wedding was something he was forced to do. I don't have a problem with him being in love with her specifically, as much as I have a problem with him being in love in general. That's...not the Doctor's *thing*, I feel. I disliked it with the Rose arc and I dislike it here as well. This may or may not be my personal thing, but it is where I stand.

I agree with you that there should be a River Song spin-off show. I think it would do well, it would be good for her character development and most of all it would keep her from monopolizing every single Doctor Who episode she features in. I would watch a River Song spin-off happily because I want to *see* this character. The show keeps insisting that she's amazing and awesome and that I should like her, but while wasting time on showing off how she's better than the Doctor at flying the Tardis or having her fire out sassy quips in rapid succession, I feel we never really got to 'see' River Song. 

I want to *see* that process of her overcoming her programming, I want to see what she's been up to those thousands of years while trying to bring the Doctor back. Now one might wonder: ""So then why are you so opposed to her being in Doctor Who all the time?"" Well, that's just the thing - she's got this ridiculously complicated, overly-grandiose backstory which is IMPOSSIBLE to explain believably without an honestly unfair amount of screentime dedicated to her. I love Matt Smith's Doctor, but I've grown so weary with his journey being constantly interrupted in blocks of River episodes which not only stop any other plot development aside from hers but make it downright impossible for one to even exist.

You may be right that River has amazing character development. It is possible I didn't observe it the way you have because I don't like her and on a subconscious level I refused to, just waiting for her episodes to be over. To me River has always been more a sum of complications, plot-twists and timey-wimeyness than an actual character. I don't know a single aspect of her personality. I mean *actual* personality, the little things such as what she likes to eat or what's her favourite colour or does she like cats, or what's her stance on giving second chances, punishing wrongdoings, when to take justice into one's own hands - all of these things we know about the Doctor, we know about (most) companions but we don't know about her because so much time is spent explaining where she came from, how she got here and how much she loves the Doctor.

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"Up until Defoe was injured I think our middle 3 (it felt like a dynamic 4-2-3-1) were really fluid. Dempsey floated onto the left, Bale into the middle. I even saw Lennon chiming in down the left a few times. Whilst Dempsey wasn't impressive here, it helped Bale get on the ball more and he got to make more runs. 

In the second half (Dempsey at striker) he was quiet.

I don't like the idea of Dempsey starting as a lone striker. But coming on at the back end of games to help out the play and get on the end of balls, he can play that role. He would basically do what Defoe did last season. Run himself rampant in the last 20 minutes of a game in search of a goal.

&gt;The way I picture it is trying to play someone like Rafa as a lone striker; it just looks messy to me.

Well Rafa is a true number 10. He was built to play in that hole. Dempsey is used to leading the line (typically from the left in a 4-4-2) and the transition to striker for him is much easier than it would be for VDV, Holtby or Siggy.

I would like to see us start with something like:

Adebayor

Bale--Siggy--Lennon

And then sub for:

Dempsey

Bale--Holtby--Lennon

It's absolutely beautiful scenery there, and if you're interested in solitude it's a lot quieter than the Lake District (I've been walking there on some days, and in 10 hours only seen a couple of people).

Accomodation is also a fair bit cheaper than the Lake District. Llanberis has a few Victorian hotels  that are pretty cheap and there plenty of secluded B&amp;Bs scattered around the area.

Yes invest in a technology that doesn't exist and might never exist. Great plan there.    

&gt; Now before people pull out that fuel is too much, pollution and traffic etc etc.     

So you do know why what you're saying is nonsense then?    

&gt; Cars are greener everyday     

You didn't address traffic. Also making petrol powered cars ""greener"" has diminishing returns. Plus we would need massive battery breakthroughs for electric to become more viable than it already is.    

Current batteries are too expensive (they use rare earth metals) and don't last long enough (&lt;10 years).    

&gt; I'm curious to what everyone else thinks about this?

true,whistleflute,null,null,"I think this could actually turn into being one of our most important run-ins in recent history. We're still a few signings away from being a definitive top-4 side, and everything's hanging by a thread: if we miss out on Champion's League football this year then I can see Bale going.

We still haven't replaced VdV or Modric, and our current team is very Bale-centric. He's single hand-idly saved our necks with his last two goals (a moment of magic from nothing), but looking at our first choice team we don't have any other 'big-game players'. Lennon has had a great season, but how much of that is off the back of the threat of Bale on the opposite wing? When Bale's not been there in the past Lennon he has been fairly easily marked out of the game, and struggles to make an impact. Likewise Defoe. Dembele started brightly with some great runs, but he seems to be at best an engine and not one for match-winning brilliance. Modric, VdV, and to a lesser extent Berbatov, had the ability to change a game with a moment of skill that our current team lack. Currently we are a very athletic side, but we lack that flair that has been so synonymous with Tottenham sides of old (Hoddle, Ginola, Gascoigne etc).

I'm actually nervously optimistic about Defoe's injury. I think giving Adebayor a run in the team will do his confidence a lot of good, and I honestly believe he offers a lot more going forward than Defoe especially playing away to Stoke, Chelsea and West Ham. Harry struggled with Defoe/Adebayor and AVB didn't do much better (I don't think playing them together is a real option). With Adebayor up front, and Holtby in the hole, I think we have a physical, fast and skilful front line that can hold up the ball well, threaten from crosses, and draw the best out of our wingers.

Munich was awesome, the first time I was there I drank way too much at the Hofbrauhaus and Augustiner Brauhaus and then mistakenly thought the U-bahn was closed even though it was just a small part of the station shut for cleaning :/ So I walked home across a large part of Munich drunk at like 2am and I was fine. Needless to say I never drunk that much again, if you can't tell if the U-bahn is working, you've drunk too much!

But yeah in general it is a much better attitude to drinking in Germany, people seem to drink earlier in the evenings too which I prefer as it's more of a social thing rather than just getting wasted at night. Some even have a drink with lunch o_0

Who knows why they are hiding here, probably because they are on the run. But this is a list of foreign fugitives. I would expect everyone on this list to be both foreign and a fugitive. Who is it that they are most wanted by? Well, European Police agencies from the [sounds of it](http://www.crimestoppers-uk.org/media-centre/news-releases/2013/most-wanted-campaign-operation-sunfire-seeks-criminals-sheltering-in-uk). You astutely noticed that all of these criminals are from Europe, although some of them are from Southern Europe and some are from Central. Indicating that perhaps these are the most wanted European criminals hiding in Britain. 

Notice how not one of those people is anything like a ""big player"". Also notice how not one of those people are terrorists or war criminals. Who are presumable a bigger target than [a robber](http://wanted.crimestoppers-uk.org/detail.aspx?ID=46194).

true,BoredPenslinger,troughton,Troughton,"Right. Here's my suggestions for you:

*Hartnell: An Unearthly Child*. It's the first ever episode, and worth watching just on the basis of that. But it's a cracking piece of TV too. The following story about cavemen, not so much.

Alternative as I think you've seen AUC - *The War Machines*

*Troughton: Invasion*. Troughton's my favourite Doctor, but he suffered most from the BBC destroying tapes. Which is why only a few of the Invasion episodes still exist. However, the DVD includes animated reconstructions that are charming. And for my money, Invasion is still the best Cyberman story ever.

*Pertwee: The Silurians*. Moral quandry? UNIT? A hi-tech installation under siege? Why, it's the Pertwee era in microcosm! Although as a New Series fan, you might find the old-style Silurians a little difficult to take seriously.

*Baker, T: City of Death*. It was written by Douglas Adams, has a cameo from John Cleese, and is about as ""timey-wimey"" as the old series gets. Plus Scaroth the Jagaroth is the most under-rated Who villain ever. Oh, and you should also check out *Genesis of the Daleks* too. 

*Davison: Caves of Androzani.* The best regeneration story ever. Bar none. Tennant's regeneration story nicks lots of beats from this - spaceship crash, sacrifice to save a companion, brief appearances from old companions. But Androzani does it far, far better.

*Baker, C*: He had to suffer some dross stories, bless him. *The Two Doctors* is my ""favourite,"" but that's only because I like Troughton and Sontarans. If you're not averse to Big Finish Audio Dramas, The One Doctor is far better than anything Colin managed on screen.

*McCoy*: I won't have McCoy Who in the house. Someone tried to convince me that The *Curse of Fenric* is good, but I'm not prepared to sit through that tosser. And Ace can fuck off too.

*McGann: The Movie* is your only choice here for televised adventures, which is a shame as there's some fantastic Audio drama out there with Eight. *The Chimes of Midnight* is one of my favourite Who stories ever.

That's my recommendations for each of the Classic Doctors. Just remember to take it on its own merits. The pacing is far slower than New Who, and the effects range from shonky to abysmal.

true,StellaLux,smith,Smith,"I never thought of it as the show telling me he loved her without evidence, for me it was a lot of subtle and straight forward things, the hair tuck before he goes to talk to her at the end of Flesh and Stone, the fact that he was a bit annoyed at her saying she was engaged in the same episode(I'm pretty sure he met her a few times between Time of Angels and forest of the Dead. I think Moffat said somewhere that the Picnic at Asgard was with 10, somehow I feel this was awkward for him). The ""Hi honey I'm home"" in The Big Bang was a little more obvious. The look on his face when Canton said she ran off the 50th floor, not to mention the ridiculous amount of flirting before the Silence killing. In Lets Kill Hitler he keeps calling her River, he is certainly smart enough to know she isn't River yet, but he doesn't call her Melody. The Night and the Doctor minisodes has Amy saying he only dresses up for River and the implications that he went out while Amy and Rory slept to parties with River, and the look on his face when older her says she and older him are going to Dirillium in the last on. And then The Angels Take Manhattan was so blatant it was like a shippers dream come true, he does the hair check before leaving the Tardis, does his flirty hello, kisses her on the cheek, and seriously he totally checks her out when he walks behind her to get to her left side. When she says it's professor Song now, he actually looked a little sad. Also in the Asylum of the Daleks prequal he answers ""there's a woman who wants to meet you"" with ""That's nice, but I'm married.""

So I disagree with the no evidence to him loving her, to be honest it doesn't bother me too much because I think there's more to their relationship than what we would consider a romantic relationship(also I think it's probably open if there is a sexual component at all; seriously if I never forget one thing established by 10, it's that he gets around quite a bit). To me there was build up, it's not like Rose where I got to the end of Doomsday and went ""He's in love with her? Did I miss something?"" I mean I could tell she totally wanted him, but all i could see from him was friend love. Keep in mind I saw Rose before I saw River, so I wasn't clouded by established opinion.

I don't think he needs to go be in love with everyone, but every once and a while doesn't hurt, plus she's the closest thing in the universe to another Time Lord there is, so there's probably some attachment, not necessarily a romantic attachment, from that.

I think part of the reason I like her as well is because I like being able to fill things in in my head. I do it for a lot of characters across a lot of media, I've done it to news casters o_O. It's a wonder I don't write fanfic.

I don't think you need to worry about River episodes so much anymore, that was just the series 6 arch really. I think she's in the last episode for 7, but that's only two episodes this series, TATM wasn't centred on her, and I doubt the finale wile be. 

I really really would love more chance to see her on the show, but a lot of things are tied to Kingston's schedule, she lives in L.A. and she has gotten jobs there, plus I don't think she wants to make her daughter move.

But she could totally record radio dramas from there.

Anyway I can see where you're coming from i, plus I don't expect us all to see eye to eye on everything(it's the straight hate that bothers me), or even like everything that happens on the show.

I was actually under the impression that he was performing more as a sweeper keeper than he has been in the previous two years.

If Reina gets dropped by this mistake then I think that would be a mistake, even though I am not an advocate of any player having a subscription to the 1st team.

Artists creating a popular, commercial product have nothing to fear, they will be able to profit and continue to work. Everybody will be happy, and the taxpayer does not have to shell out. 

If no-one is willing to pay to see the play/exhibit, then one wonders quite how much the community would miss its loss. I am sure that some people would push for subsidies for artistic groups, but it is hard to argue that this is more important than social care, or child poverty spending.

High subsidies simply create  'zombie companies' that hemorrhage money and allow lots of people to work on projects with dubious utility.

What I'm interested is where the turnover goes.  Considering this is entirely a distribution arm for programs that the license payer pays for, why is there profit margin only in the 15% bracket?

Go and have a read about hollywood accounting and you'll see what I'm talking about.

Here's another question for you -- why do you think that over the last twenty years the BBC has moved from being a producer of programs itself to starting to rely heavily on outside production companies.  I find that highly suspicious.  Suspicious because it becomes very easy to turn program assets that the BBC should own by virtue of having purchased them into license payments for use of intellectual property now owned by these production companies.  Those production companies have then had their development costs paid, and yet still own assets.

Profit is a completely fluid number; you need only look at the fun games that Starbucks (to pick one) plays to move their profit around to avoid paying tax.  The BBC accountants will be no less adept at moving the public money to places where it makes the most privately takeable profit.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;a radical recalibration of capitalism is essential

Such a lie.  No attempt to recalibrate capitalism could conceivably _be_ radical.  At most it would be reformist, and probably an insipid form of reform far less ""dramatic"" than those implemented by Roosevelt.  The New Deal was implemented with a gun to held to his (and more importantly the capitalists') head(s) by active and organised labour movements, socialists and (shock, horror!) communists.  He was able to sell wholesale reform to the rich, by pointing to the angry masses and saying to the rich and powerful, ""major reform or the end of capitalism, your choice?""  The majority of the rich and powerful chose the reform option, and it worked, for a while.  Unemployment benefits, pensions, jobs, flowed like wine during a period they had been claiming previously was a barren wasteland of austerity, because the country was broke and had no money to pay for it.  They had the money, just as they have it now, matter (and money) cannot be created nor destroyed, wealth is just redistributed.  Of course, then the rich and powerful set about destroying organised labour, the communists, the socialists, and the reforms; the very groups which had bought their (and capitalism's) salvation. 

Even if it were open to us to make drastic reforms (and the current demolition of centuries' old protections of working people, without a whisper of protest, imply it is not), if people are suckered into the reform route again, with a new Glass-Steagall Act etc., everything they win will be reversible orders-of-magnitude more quickly, because now money and corporations totally dominate politics, like never before in history, and the plutocratic and corporate interests have the experience, the resources and the point men and women in positions of political influence to unpick everything within years rather than decades.

It also runs the UK's largest DVD distributor (not just for BBC shows, but releases across the board stuff originally on ITV, Sky, CH4 etc), runs the UK's largest record label, owns Lonely Planet and contributes funding to those BBC shows that would sell well internationally on a commercial basis and so deserve more money than the Public Service BBC can afford to increase production values (examples of this include Parade's End, Spies of Warsaw, Doctor Who, Ripper Street, The Hour, Dara o Briain's Science Club, Top Gear - almost the entire cost of Top Gear is met by BBC Worldwide &amp; Jeremy Clarkson's company Bedder 6!).

BBCW also owns various stakes (up to 50%) in independent production companies, again for commercial value rather than as a cartel system (which would be highly illegal and subject to Ofcom, UK and EU prosecution)


Now, as to the BBC's increased use of independent production companies, this is nothing new. Since 1998 the BBC commissioning process has had to consider independent productions on an equal footing with in-house development. In addition, by law, there is a quota of 25% of the totality of the BBC's output that must come from independent production companies.

There is an additional 25% quota for each of BBC1 and BBC2. This is essential because of the dominance the BBC has over our industry and is there to safeguard the stability, diversity and quality of British broadcasting as a whole.

As a case study, Merlin came from the indie Shine. The BBC paid Shine a fixed fee per episode, but Shine's budget per episode could exceed that because of the additional income from international sale. This is a regular and positive occurrence in the industry - Downton Abbey costs about £1 million per episode more than ITV pays for it because the indie can recoup its additional investment through American sales - and it increases the value to the licence fee payer.

And just where do you think BBC Worldwide's ""secret profits"" would go? The BBC is its sole shareholder, the accounts and directors' compensation are publicly available and BBC Worldwide is heavily regulated both by the BBC and Ofcom.

And here's news for you: BBC Worldwide's 2011/12 profit was £155 million, yet it put £216 million back into the BBC - there's part of the turnover right there.

- You need a degree in the subject you want to teach, however level 4/5 NVQ is equivalent and can be considered.  

- Given you have no A-Levels and 1 Level 3 NVQ, and it's in supporting teaching and learning, I'm not sure on whether you meet the requirements, even if you turn your Level 3 into a 4. (Qualified to be a TA?) You may need to do a degree (for example a BA in English Studies if you want to teach English).  
 

- You need GCSE in Maths and English to be at least Cs (Science as well if you want to teach Primary School).  

- Work experience is crucial. When you apply through GTTR for a teaching degree, (PGCE for example), you are required to fill-in a box about relevant experience. Even doing one full day a week volunteering as a classroom assistant is handy.   

- If you go for a Post-Compulsory (16+) Education Teaching degree, you are only qualified to teach High School if it's at GCSE Level. This is the one I'm starting in September, as I want to teach A-Level and equivalent English.   

- This probably is common sense, but whatever Teaching course you look at, if you want to be a qualified teacher, make sure it states that with the qualification, you are given QTS  (Qualified Teaching Status)

However I did significantly better.  Upon receiving my results I called up the contact at Lancaster to request I be put upon a BA course that combined a year abroad with a year in industry.  They weren't able to do this, but I did get a cast iron agreement that I would go abroad for sure in my second year.  I didn't slack off in my first year, but it is strange that the first year grades I got didn't count towards my degree overall.

I really enjoyed the degree because of the breadth it offered in being able to try so many different subjects.  The OWT modules I did were my favourite at Lancaster.  Brian Bloomfield was an excellent lecturer.

UF was so different compared to Lancaster in scale, the quality of facilities and weather!  It was the best year.  Academically, being able to do a first year accountancy course with 2500 students along with some fourth year courses with only 30 provided a great contrast.  The methods of grading were also very different.  Lots of multiple choice exams for the larger course combined with a lot of coursework for the smaller.

Outside of work there was the obvious culture shock of being somewhere really very different to home.  I got a bit of this despite having been to America several times.  However cheering the football team with 90,000 others in the stadium is something I won't forget.  Nor spring break, or sorority parties, or sometimes not being able to buy beer, or how hot the girls were etc!

Since graduating I worked in sales for a number of years.  However, I recently quit to go back to university in September to help me change career completely.

Edit: Going to expand on that a little but. I believe the 'Wall' represents the border between England and Scotland, 'Hadrian's Wall' is obviously the visual inspiration for 'The Wall' in GOT - but the political divide would be the border itself. The mountain clans and wildlings in northern Westeros are representative of the mosstroopers and borderers who dwelt along the anglo-scottish border i.e. hard, fierce soldiers with little/no loyalty to distant central authority.

I believe the 'Percies' of Northumberland were the Starks because of two things: 

1. Parallels with GOT's religious differences are perhaps a reflection of the reformation that ultimately led to rebellion (Northern Catholics vs Southern Protestants) of which the Percies actively supported
2. The saying in the north at the time was 'No King but a Percy'.

**We never got anything from the 'optional service charge' that was added automatically to all the bills**, the management tried to bullshit it away by claiming that we earned it back through free meals and slightly higher pay but ultimately it was just daylight robbery. I got £1 extra per hour than a friend at another restaurant and I would be losing out on at least £10 an hour's worth of tips, **ergo they would basically be paying my wages with the money I should have been getting from tips.**

I don't see how this can be legal but i'm guessing in my contract somewhere there was a disclaimer about it, it was my first waiting job and I didn't really understand how much more you could make from tips. I quit after a few months.

From speaking to people in other places it seems a fair few restaurant chains are starting to do this and it's horrendous, I really hope something can be done to stop it.

And - though this offers only a small amount of comfort considering how close we were to winning - the *way* we played was very encouraging.

I like looking through matches to the next ""benchmark"" match (Champions League contenders) which would be the Spurs match:

* v. West Brom
* v. Swansea
* @ Wigan
* v. Tottenham

Now, it's up to Rodgers to keep this team extremely focused and the players need to step up as well to continue playing as they did against big clubs like Arsenal and Man City. If that happens... wins against West Brom and Wigan should be relatively easy. Swans will surely play tough but surely we can get a hard-fought 3 points out of this match. Then we'll have to see what we can do against Spurs.

As for stats... I couldn't find it but someone posted a link that projected matches for Liverpool and calculated their odds for a fourth place spot.

It's not the first time he's done that, he did it earlier in the season but to good effect as he knocked the ball out for a throw of corner I believe, I'm trying to remember what match it was but I simply can't. I remember him doing once or twice in previous seasons too and not getting caught out. It's a pretty wtf moment to see your keeper race from the goal line like that.

Our Goalkeeper situation is a tough one. What I'd like to see happen is we bring in a relatively young but experienced keeper and have both himself and Reina compete for the number one spot, if Reina's form doesn't improve, then we sell him. Part of Reina's slip in form, I believe, has been lack of competition for his spot for the last few seasons and maybe having a very good second keeper might spur him on a bit. Of course there's a risk involved here as Reina's price could drop further if there's no improvement. Another contributing factor to his slip is his favoured Goalkeeping coach Xavi Valero being let go when Hodgson arrived, which I believe Reina was upset by.

A Goalkeeper along with a new centre-back should be priority in the summer and I believe it will be as the midfield and forward line have been strengthened considerably compared to last season.

true,SpottieOttieDopalis,lfc68,,"&gt; Sergio Agüero and Edin Dzeko contributed little in the defensive phase of play

That's one of the things that I found odd about Macini's tactics. We clearly struggle when teams press high up the pitch with high energy forwards like Welbeck or Walters, but the pair of Aguero and Dzeko offered little workrate. Tevez would have been a much better choice IMO. As great as Lucas and Gerrard are, in their respective roles, they're not Xavi and Busquets and they clearly struggle with their positioning when teams press us - to be fair the whole teams does as well. Tevez could have occupied Lucas or Gerrard, whenever they showed for the ball, and forced us to launch the ball up the pitch. 

Maybe Mancini saw that we struggled with big CFs in the past, but it was still an odd choice IMO.

&gt; On balance, considering Henderson’s performance against Arsenal in midweek in the central role (and Suarez’s goal), then Suarez’s impact from between the lines in this match, **it’s fair to conclude that Rodgers probably got his shape correct in both games**.

That's another positive to take away from both games as well. It's nice to see Rodgers choose the right formation from the start and not have to react like he did in the United and Everton games. Don't get me wrong, it was nice to see that we have a manager capable of changing and choosing the right tactics if things weren't going well, but it was much more pleasing to see us start the game with the right tactics to begin with.

The idea of a restaurant, or anyone for that matter, presuming they deserve payment for 10% (or more, in some cases) more than what I already paid for is ridiculous. If they feel they're 10% better than their competitors, they should charge 10% more on the menu and let people decide for themselves whether or not paying the extra is worth it.

Bar staff may get to keep the coppers if a drink is near as damn it to a round total.

Taxi drivers get their fee rounded up to the nearest quid or so just because when I'm staggering out of a taxi at 3am I don't want to have to deal with keys, wallet, phone and a fist full of shrapnel as well as competing with gravity and a stomach full of booze and takeaway all attempting to make me chew on the pavement.

I'll share my opinion on him from watching him. He's very good with his feet, and was the start of a build from the back style Borussia Mönchengladbach used. I say used because although Mönchengladbach were nicknamed ""Borussia Barcelona"" last season due to their style. They look like a different team this season, similar comparisons can be made with Ter Stegan. He hasn't looked like the same player as last season - apart from a wonderful performance against Bayern Munich and other - and it's effected the team.

Overall, I have to say if it was my money I wouldn't be keen. No doubt he was great last season but with his form this season and moving to a new league it would be a risk. Mönchengladbach would ask for £15mill-ish I'd imagine. He has a contract until the summer of 2015 and is still considered to be the eventual replacement for Neuer despite stagnation, even with Liverpool's historical relationship with Mönchengladbach, I'd expect £15mill plus.

Yes, I do think that ideally everyone would be able to go to see an art gallery or a play or a film regardless of income. But not everyone would want to go to see these things. 

It would be more economically efficient to simply give the subsidy money to (low income?) households, then let people choose what to spend their money on. Then everyone could afford to go see a play / exhibit if they wanted to, but those who would prefer to go swimming or buy a hat can do that instead. While, I would agree that it is preferable for people to have the choice to see art, the current system means that many low and medium households are paying tax for art they have zero interest in. That doesn't strike me as ideal either. 

If the money went directly to households, art lovers could then purchase exactly the same amount of art (if they wished), but it would also mean that households with no interest in art can spend the money on something they do want.

Pep's the real deal, the man has literally won it all at international level, and has achieved a lot at club level too. He has been the star of the show on countless occasions for LFC. IMO, what is truly cringeworthy, is that LFC fans are even considering the likes of Al Habsi as a replacement for one of our best players over the past decade.

...whilst they're still in their very high profile and very politically sensitive job , but prior to using their ex-PM status to get fat wads on the after-dinner speaking circuit. 

But it's still far less than CEOs of many corporations get, and orders of magnitude less than a CEO of a company with an equivalent sized staff. And I would think we want to attract competent people to those roles. 

What a fair salary for a council Chief Exec' is I have no idea, but I do think comparing it to the PMs salary is a little bit daft. One's a politician who'd get dragged through the mud for overseeing a rise to their own pay in any climate, and where the earning potential from that role then extends to the end of their days, and the other is an executive position in the normal job market that you have to apply for and be awarded.

In my opinion, public transport should not be subject to profitability criteria. It's there because it's more efficient and it's the only way that you can scale large cities. 

It's as simple as: http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3578/3399179623_02886c8b55_z.jpg?zz=1

It's a necessity, and I believe it should be subsidised. The economic case is that it makes cities *functional* and gets people in and out of cities. Functional cities are profitable and therefore bring in more wealth to the nation. 

Are footpaths profitable? Are parks profitable? So why should trains and buses be profitable?

Pepe hasn't been in the form we're used to recently and we should definitely be thinking about what might happen if/when he does depart, whether that's in the summer or years from now.  He's making too many silly errors, some of which lead to embarrassing goals conceded.  He's beaten on his near post too often and is incresaingly getting caught flat-footed.  His kicking hasn't been great recently either and I find myself getting nervous whenever the ball comes to him...something I've never felt about him before.

For my two cents, I would certainly be in favour of bringing in a young up-and-coming keeper; one who can develop with us and one day take over first team duties and be as good, if not better, than Reina.  Someone like ter Stegen would be ideal, imo.  Young, quick, will only get better.  The lack of quality we have in back-up keepers is a worry as well.  I like Jones, but he's not exactly young and can't really be seen as one for the future.

I love Pepe, always have.  But for the good of the team, I think we need to start looking for our next #1.

Assuming you'll forgive this foray into the issue here - people will disagree with me but this is the way I see it (having spent longer, I bet, than Coren thinking about it): 

That was one of the issues I had with the piece - she doesn't understand the position most atheists hold nor, I think, the nature of agnosticism with/versus atheism. 

There are two types of atheism: strong and weak.

* A strong atheist has the position: I believe there is no god (of any kind).

* A weak atheist has the position: I do not believe in a god (of any kind).

The first is a positive claim - a claim to the truth of the situation/reality. With some gods it is actually possible to be a strong atheist with regard to that god - Actually the Christian god (as some claim) is one of those, [though the issue is debated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnipotence_paradox.)

*Most* atheists, the vast majority, hold the weak position mainly because it is the response to a claim made by the religious. If no religious people existed, the claim: ""There is a god and it is X."" would ever be made and consequently would never have to be responded to. The same way that you are an 'atheist' with regards to the Bumplewurzle (abumplewurzlist) when I tell you ""There is a Bumplewurzle"", you're not necessarily saying ""I believe there is no bumplewurzle"" but rather responding to my claim and saying: ""I do not believe this Bumplewurzle exists[because you have/I see no proof]"".

This is entirely different from agnosticism, which concerns itself with whether or not you can know if a god (or something) exists. So you are correct in so far as you need faith for the Christian god and should be agnostic about it but it doesn't end there . Aside: though you'll notice that Christians around the world differ in their opinion with regards to the agnosticism aspect: I think you'll find a good many gnostic (they claim) Christians in various parts of America for example. In the UK they're probably a good deal rarer.

So there are four possibilities, [outlined neatly in this graph linked.](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lznwfsQXuL1qk9h5d.jpg) Of course, some people say ""I don't care"" but fuck 'em because they're cluttering up the place! :D

A lot of people seem to avoid the label ""Atheist"" due to actions and claims of various groups over the years. It's really nothing to be scared of or worried about calling yourself, and far more people than admit it, or probably know, are atheists. My step father, for example, gets annoyed when I point out he is because he refuses the label. Mind you, he doesn't understand the above argument no matter how many times I explain it:

Consider the question: Do you believe in a god, X or any god?

If the answer is *anything* but ""Yes"", then you are an atheist (with regard to that god X etc.). That's it. Nothing more, nothing less: it doesn't mean you're in love with Dawkins, it doesn't mean you campaign for this group or that, it doesn't mean you're immoral or lack empathy, it doesn't mean you wish bad things on others: It just means you do not accept the claim that a god, X, or any god, exists. Just like any other (mythical) thing you've ever heard or not heard about.

Whether or not you can *know* that, is another matter entirely.

Personally I'm an agnostic atheist. I think I know a couple of gnostic atheists, but they've not convinced me.

TL;DR - Coren doesn't understand the difference between atheism and agnosticism. One does not have to be one or the other but can be both. Most people are, particularly when you consider that even if someone believes in a god, they're still an atheist with regard to all the others.",0,1360006305,null,0,false,0,c899fts,t3_17sw6t,t1_c899fts,t1_c892jq6,null,1431182308,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,B4mf0rth,null,null," If you want a system that was structured to favour a tiny number of the very rich, look at the US in the time of Carnegie or Pullman where workers had no rights, employers had no obligations to them whatsoever, no environmental laws, no minimum wage, no hour limits, no enforced discrimination laws and very few political rights. No safety in the workshops, no real unions and absolutely no benefits. No one could tell the company leaders of that time what to do and adjusted for inflation, many of the big names from that time are still the richest people to have ever lived. 

Fast forward to modern Britain and you have Health and Safety manuals and guidelines for everything to make sure no worker is hurt, you have maternity leave, sick leave, holidays, employers are required to give you regular breaks. There is minimum wage, legal rights, unions and rights groups who are not only legal but hold legitimate clout. There are proper standards for food, hygiene, education and benefits to provide a floor on which everyone can stand equally. Employers can't randomly cut your wages and then if you complain, fire you without question (some may do, but they can be sued for it). There are obligations they hold for their customers such as the 14 day credit return period, damaged goods and the rest of it to make sure those who can't afford it don't get ripped off. The NHS and Fire Service are now free whereas once only the rich could afford such things. There are now political bodies such as Ofcom or even higher international bodies who can enforce colossal fines on these rich companies which abuse their position. More students than ever are going to our world class universities from lower socio-economic backgrounds. Discrimination laws are now very strict whereas once they were non-existant or even existed to enforce discrimination. The poorer majority benefit hugely more from all of this than the very rich benefit. 

I'm not inviting sympathy for the rich. I'm simply arguing against the insane idea that the structure of our country is solely geared towards exploiting the very poor and ensuring only the rich get any wealthier. It's sensationalist and stupid.

You can't really blame her for turning out crazy. It wasn't her fault not one bit of it was her fault. She was a baby that was brain washed into believing that the Doctor was an evil person. 
I love how Steven put her in the way she is. I agree with the one comment on here about her having her own spin off like Sarah Jane. River has become a big part of the show. She has done amazing from becoming crazy to in love to the wife of the doctor. 

She is just something else, someone who can't be messed with. Melody Pond. I wish that there was someway to tell how she would have grown up if she wasn't stolen by the silence. It always makes me wonder. I guess if you think about it her name would not be Melody Pond - River Song it would be something else and she would completely become someone else. 
I feel River is indeed a very tricky Character that should be handle wisely with care. I also believe under all that toughness she is very gentle and sweet. That is River song but everything just about she has to fake. If the doctor really were to die she really would have lost her mind I believe. There is so much more to River Song that he hasn't told us yet.

I'm not 100% sure that the style Rodgers wants to play can be made to work in the Premiership, but having committed to it we need to go all in, and that means a keeper who sometimes takes those risks. The ability to bore opponents and neutral spectators to death with passes back to the keeper is a key part of Rodgers's neo-Paisley game plan.

And I agree with ""consistent"", which to me means ""experienced"". We need a 28 year old with the ball skills of an outfield player, and we need the maturity as fans to accept that risks will be taken.

In ""Time Crash"", where the 10th Doctor meets the 5th, he notices that his past incarnation appears much older than he should, only to comment that it's because them being together ""shorted out the time differential"". This seems to imply that the reason past doctors always looked older in multi-doctor episodes is because this ""time differential"" shorts out, causing every incarnation to appear the age of the most recent. If Sean Pertwee appeared as the 3rd Doctor, he would appear far younger than he was even when he was the active Doctor, which would make no sense given the previous explanation.

And even if they somehow worked around that, it just wouldn't be the same. Sure, he may look like his father, but it still wouldn't be the same as having the real Jon Pertwee up and playing the Doctor. Jon was in the role for 3 years, and made further cameos as his incarnation practically until the day he died. There's no way another actor could match the way he played the role. The same could be said for William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton as well.

There's zero good business sense in that, and the sooner everyone accepts Liverpool fucked up instead of spouting this ""But he's Torres minus 15m!"" bullshit the better.

And even if you buy the whole transfer fee nonsense, how do you justify paying Carroll, a player who at that point had half a season of PL football under his belt, 80k/wk? There's not another club in the world that would do that, not even Man City.

And really at this point, it's the 80k/wk that is a bigger issue with keeping Carroll. If he was on something closer to his real value - 40-50k/wk - then it might be feasible to have him as a plan B in Rodgers' current squad, work on getting him used to the new style of play, etc. But you can't have someone who will be on the bench most weeks collecting 80k/wk, especially when you aren't in the CL.",0,1360017203,null,0,false,0,c89d9tb,t3_17vclu,t1_c89d9tb,t1_c8972c7,null,1431185247,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

I've not watched any full shows with Alf Garnet in, but I'm sure I've seen a  clip of him saying that, although I know for definite that I have heard Al Murray (comedian, if that's what you can call him) use the same term.

I can't see how I can be a misogynist, because I'm female. I don't feel I hate women that make these stupid choices, I feel ashamed to be female because i think they give the rest of us a bad name.

If there wasn't this absurd idea that having a kid entitles you to social housing and lots of nice cashmonies benefits, and if we did't give them out, I can guarantee that pregnancy rates among unwed women who don't have an actual relationship with the father of the baby would go down. What incentive would these people have to keep their kid?

""I take issue with your assertion that there is an appreciable number of women who just get knocked up to get a council flat- and for the ones that do: what a dismal life.""

See above, but I stick by my point - it pays far more in benefits (both ££ and ancillary benefits) than it does to go and get a job. The benefits of having a child by someone you don't know and opting to be a single parent s far outweigh those of having an abortion and getting on with working and having a career. 


While these people may not specifically choose to, when thy *do* end up pregnant, their decision to keep the child is massively influenced by the benefits they will get.

I had an abortion when I was 19. One of the reasons i gave for not wanting to keep the pregnancy was that I could not afford it and I was still living with my Mum at the time.

A ""Counsellor"" went through the list of benefits I could get, and highlighted the fact that I could move into temporary accommodation
immediately, and the COuncil would either bend over backwards to find me a social place, or give me housing benefit once ""baby"" was born.

It actually worked out that I would have been better off if I had kept it, in terms of money.

The fact is (and you can deny it all you like, it does not change it - ask any teacher at a mediocre secondary school in a crap area) that there is a generation of people for whom the easy choice and the path of least resistance is the most attractive.

Yes, there's exceptions. There always will be. But there is, to our shame as a nation, a group of people who're aware of what they're ""entitled to"" from the State, if they end up in a situation where they can get it, then it'll pay them a lot more to do that than do the sensible thing and have an abortion.

There are so many societies to join, but you should definitely join the karate club. You have the option of living in town, or campus again in the 2nd and 3rd year. I lived in town for 2nd and 3rd because I liked being close to the city centre and having a larger bedroom and living room.

Just stagger home with a kebab at 5am, it only takes 10 mins. And even if you are living on campus and find yourself stuck after a night out you could always walk (takes about 45mins) or splash out on a taxi for £12.

What's it about the karate club that should make me want to join?

I'm considering the triathlon soc, though I've never done a triathlon before and my overall skills are a bit rusty. Did you join the gym? I'm curious as to how much time people can actually allocate to hitting the gym in between lectures, studies and socializing.

I wish I could easily come to an open day, but I'm in Australia at the moment and I'll be travelling around here and Asia until the end of May/early June. Plus, I'm from Germany, so it's costly and very much a hassle to make the trip.

""The adverts are the best bit"" and are the best part of the tradition. I've never even seen it or spoken to an american about it but even *I* know the adverts are the best bit and it's worth switching it on just for that!!

I know all of these things are true about american culture because for my entire life these things have been present in the american media I've watched: Friends, Scrubs, How I met your mother, The Simpsons, Malcom in the Middle, Saved by the Bell, .... All these shows have a token Thanksgiving episode, a token Halloween episode, a token Christmas episode, a token New Year episode, and a token *Superbowl* episode. All these shows reflect and comment on modern american culture, so it stands to reason that the heavy presence of the superbowl in american media for the past X years means it's a proper tradition that's been present in the american media for the past X years right?! It totally doesn't indicate heavy advertising for the past X years does it! That is perfectly sound logic!

Seriously though: I find it unnerving that even as a British person I instinctively know that the adverts are so heavily entwined with the superbowl that they *belong* in the superbowl - it just wouldn't be the same without them, it wouldn't be worth watching.

It's quite an old model now though, so maybe they've improved that aspect of it in newer models.

For comparison, my mum has a twin channel TVonics that has a clearer interface but isn't quite as flexible. For example: if it's recording two channels you can only watch one of those channels or another recording. Whereas the Humax only has that restriction if the two recording channels and the one you want to watch are all on different multiplexes.

&gt;And further to this what kind of TARDIS does the Doctor fly, Is it a battle TARDIS?

All that is probably taken from the off-screen media, which may or may not count. 

The only time the TV show ever went into detail about the Time War was *The End of Time*, when the Doctor spoke of the Nightmare Child, the Skaro Degradations, the Army of Meanwhiles and Neverweres led by the Could've Been King, and the Horde of Travesties. However, what precisely these were - and, for that matter, what Bowships, Black Hole Carriers and N Forms were - we will likely never know. 

The Doctor's TARDIS has been repeatedly identified as a TT capsule, presumably one exclusively meant for time travel. So, in all probability, it is *not* a Battle TARDIS. Given his predilection for pacifism, I doubt he would pilot a battle ship. 

Then again, in ""Doomsday"" he said he fought on the front lines of the Time War - but then again, whether he actively engaged Daleks in combat is unknown. ",0,1360025439,null,0,false,0,c89fvv9,t3_17unho,t1_c89fvv9,t3_17unho,null,1431190739,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

This, in addition to the ACON has produced very limited appearances from Ade. The games during the Holiday season, he didn't look to me to be totally out of sync with the team. He held up play (like he usually does) the same manner he had last season.  
That being said, it will take a little time for hum to sync back up with Spurs tactics as opposed to Togo's. I don't think we'll see a different Ade. I think we'll see the usual Ade that we were accustomed to last season. It'll take a couple of matches for him to sync back, but I'm expecting good things from our big Togolese striker. I do agree that it could partially be a lack of confidence, but I'm more inclined to think it was match fitness and/or team cohesion that kept him back.

I agree that Reina has a lot of responsibility in Rodgers' system, and you can't just replace him with any shot-stopper - it'll take a keeper who is comfortable with the ball at his feet.

A year ago, we wouldn't be having this conversation - but two years of poor form from a keeper is inexcusable, really, for any Premier League side, let alone one with our top 4 aspirations. Obviously replacing Reina won't be easy, but now's the time to do it (ideally we'd have done it before and invested in a good backup a while ago and let him develop on loan, but that's another issue altogether)

It's also possible that when Suarez signed, the whole ""improved contract based on performances"" thing was discussed - hence him getting a new deal after 1.5 years. As for why it wasn't done in other cases? Well, I have no fucking clue.

The wages thing becomes even worse when you consider that we largely didn't have competitors for any of the players we signed - we were always favourites to land Adam, obviously we were the only ones going for Carroll at the time that we did (though there was interest from elsewhere, probably for the summer), we were the only ones after Henderson &amp; Downing. 

The only other explanation I can come up with is that Comolli was so hard-and-fast on his metrics system of crosses + headers = goals = win that he awarded those players contracts to reflect their importance to that metrics system, rather than what they deserved based on past experience - he rewarded them with the contracts they should have earnt through performances.",0,1360029617,null,0,false,0,c89h7em,t3_17vclu,t1_c89h7em,t1_c89fzpd,null,1435633374,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Henderson is fantastic with first time passes though I think fans have come see that more now.

Enrique, while he can be inconsistent, can play really incisive through balls from the left back position. I remember him being the only defender in the top 10 of accurate through balls last season.

Downing has great link up play, most people overlook this since it is seen as a given for a quality Premier League player, especially one who cost so much but how often do you see wingers carelessly give the ball away?

London to Birmingham is a comparable distance, on a nicer Virgin train, and doesn't cost that much if you just turn up. Yes it's still very expensive, but we like to complain far too much in this country.

I'd far rather we'd brought someone in and left the youngster to keep improving throughout the rest of what's so far been a very promising run the U21s have been having.

Steven Gerrard and his teammates did not play their best game against Debrecen at home at Anfield in 2009. Which made life miserable for matchfixere, who had played at the Debrecen goalkeeper would close some goals in CL showdown. (Photo: AP)
THE HAGUE (ekstrabladet.dk): Matchfixing has reached the highest level. The European police cooperation Europol confirmed Monday that not even the Champions League longer free from corruption of the results.
Specifically, the Europol Director Rob Wainwright two Champions League matches - one in English because, as he at midday on the progress of the fight against matchfixing.
For the sake of the investigation, conducted hold secret.
But Ekstra Bladet can unveil the affected matches, both originating from Debrecen stay in the Champions League in 2009. Sources of Europol confirms that there is a Hungarian team involved in CL cases.
It said English team is Liverpool, who met Debrecen at home 16th September 2009 - the first match of the group stage.
Goalkeeper probably bribed Later in the same group stage loser Debrecen at home to Fiorentina 3-4. Also the fight was fixed.
The documents in the matchfixing-case which in recent years has run through the court in Bochum, the battle between Hungarians and Liverpool are trying resolved.
In connection with wiretaps in a case related to trafficking of prostitutes fail suddenly messages down between the Dutchman Paul R and The Croatian Marijo C about manipulation of the match in Liverpool, according to the Dutch book 'Voetbal Maffia.'
The Hungarian goalkeeper Vukašin Poleksic is by all accounts bribed to shut goals to ensure that the match ends with at least three goals - bet over 2.5 goals is very popular when fixerne is at stake.
What fixerne could not figure out was that Liverpool this evening was unusually slack with terminations. Although keeper Poleksic is engineered to succeed only Liverpool to score once. Keeper Poleksic can unfortunately not hold a shot from Fernando Torres as Dirk Kuyt buffer over the line just before the break.
Gerrard should have completed much more sugar Marijo C in a text message after the game.
So the action as Rob Wainwright used to prove manipulation in the Champions League is actually also proves that matchfixerne not always successful.
Target fell into the Fiorentina match Success had to return to Debrecen-Fiorentina. Goals pours in from the start of the match. Already at halftime lead Fiorentina 4-2.
Vukašin Poleksics involvement led to him less than a year after the fighting was ruled out of UEFA. Since then, sports court CAS in Lausanne two years ago upheld the conviction.
In return, another Debrecen player, Norbert Meszaros, at the same time lifted its quarantine. CAS found no evidence that he had helped to manipulate the game.
And there is the big problem about matchfixing. It is tremendously difficult to prove. For how does one prove that a player makes mistakes on purpose? And Vukašin Poleksic Nor are doomed to manipulate. He was convicted because he reported matchfixernes attempt to manipulate him.
Liverpool and Fiorentina names lit up like neon in these cases, even if the big clubs really nothing more than innocent bystanders.
Also matches with two Danish team investigated the matchfixing, including FC Copenhagen showdown against Montenegrin FK Mogren in the Champions League qualification in 2009.

- Defoe out for 2 months, Holtby showing promise, Bale in hot form, Lennon being Lennon and Ade back from ACN. Defence holding up really well, midfield working out for us with Parker+Dembele for now.

- Everton, NUFC, Liverpool and Arsenal showing decent form, their fixtures with each other and Chelsea are key.

- Overall, I think if the Ade+Holtby link up bringing in Moussa, Lennon and Bale into the game works out, we could be pushing for 3rd spot.

- Chelsea travel to the Etihad on Feb 24, play us on April 13 and then Liverpool on April 20 with Man Utd at OT on May 4 and finish their campaign hosting Everton in the final game of the season.

Taking a look at that, I think the 3rd and 4th spot might will be left up till the very last day of the season. I just hope we don't rely TOO MUCH on the outcomes of other games rather than our own.

true,FluffyPineapple43,lfcflame,,"Ok, here goes.

Kevin Trapp, part of this amazing season at Frankfurt who continue to be the surprise team of the season, pushing for Champions League places after just being promoted last season. Although Frankfurt's league position is amazing I can't help but feel Trapp isn't at the level we should look, his passing isn't the greatest, not a player for our system I feel. We all know players and teams can be on great form when just entering a new league - just look at the likes of Jelavic and Papiss Cisse. Trapp wouldn't be a risk I'd take, not only has he not shown the ability we'd look for consistently but I feel this may be a ""one season wonder"" effect for Frankfurt too.

Ron-Robert Zieler, much like Trapp I don't think he's good enough with his feet. Although I do believe he's a better keeper than Trapp, despite probably worse form, I don't think he'd be great as an immediate replacement for Pepe.

Oliver Baumann, much like the two previous keepers the style their team plays only leads me to believe Baumann is not great with his feet and wouldn't fit in. That's just an assumption on how they're being used however. Having a good season in goal for the defence tight Freiburg. Probably having the best season of the of the three looked at so far. Again, don't think he's good enough.

Bernd Leno, now he is probably the next best keeper we could get out of Germany behind Ter Stegan. Having a much better season than Ter Stegan however being outshone by him last year. Leverkusen have been defensively sound this year, mostly down to a certain Sami Hyypia. As I said, probably next best option behind Ter Stegan and is rated just behind him still by many in Germany.

Fabian Giefer, he's a good keeper for the newly promoted Dusseldorf but again don't feel he's good enough. He's made significant improvements to Dusseldorf but it's worth noting that a 2 year younger Bernd Leno is ahead of him, and has been in their time together at Leverkusen.

Overall, for now I think we should stick with Pepe, unless a big offer comes in for him. If we do lose him I believe we should be looking for Ter Stegan or Leno if we are looking in Germany. One thing's for sure, Germany wont be lacking top goalkeepers for their national team for a long time.",0,1360062051,null,0,false,0,c89ohtz,t3_17vfvd,t1_c89ohtz,t1_c89mr4m,null,1431197327,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

What I actually think will happen is that folks will get all excited once it's complete, the councils will crow about the ""investment"" companies X, Y and Z are making in Beestion/Chilwell etc and then the whole thing will implode as the high streets in those places turn into another bland facsimile of every UK high street and pretty much become a wasteland.  We'll lose local gems like Hallam's (to name just one) and the soul that makes these towns what they are will wither and die.

Tesco certainly doesn't seem to have done Beeston any favours and I don't trust the councils to actually protect or encourage more local businesses.  Broxtowe?HenryBoot certainly seemed to be engaged on some skulduggery (or at least incompetence) with regards [plans for the square](https://beestonia.wordpress.com/2013/01/04/exclusive-beeston-square-development-news/).  And there you can clearly see the ""improvements"" planned - generic garbage that can be seen anywhere.  The current square may be a bit of a carbuncle - but can't it be replaced with something more unique, intriguing and pro-local economy that the planned garbage?  They're too scared to even put a working clock in!

Lack of investment... well. It depends. Leeds has had *vast* sums of money invested in it over the last 20 years. It's a totally different city to the one I knew as a teenager in the 90s. And the trains running West from Leeds have improved over that period too.

I think maybe people who've lived up North all their lives overestimate the amount of investment that the South of the country gets.

For the rest of the UK to accept this Scotland would have to agree to terms that would protect the UK interests so effectively have their monetry policy dictated to from Westminster.  
Also they will have to be accepted by the other member states.  Spain does not want Scotland to set a precedent because of its own separatist movements.  France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands all have separatist movements.  They do not want to make it easy for parts of their countries to split.  Do not under estimate this.

true,SushiSnuglet,eng-Bristol,Bristol,"I went to Warwick for both my bachelors and masters degree. It's right on the edge of Coventry, so you wouldn't really be 'in' the city as such. If you don't live on campus, most students live in Leamington Spa, which is a pretty reasonable town. Living in Coventry (the bits near the uni) is cheaper but then you're in Coventry. I think they're rebuilding a lot of the city centre now but it's still got a long way to go before it doesn't look like it was town-planned by the Luftwaffe. On-campus accommodation at the uni is expensive, especially for post-grads as you don't get such a choice of halls, although the top-end ones are really nice. However, if you're from Mexico you'll already be paying the enormous 'outside EU' fees so you might be able to afford it. 

I loved the uni itself. In fact, I'd like to do a PhD but I live in Bristol with my fiance now and I don't want to go anywhere other than Warwick. They've recently re-built the students union building to be a lot more modern, and there are a lot of sports groups and societies. Warwick also has a pretty large proportion of international students, which might make things easier for you. The administrative team are really good, so important paperwork about fees etc will be sent on time, which isn't always the case at other unis. The campus is quite pretty, especially the area around the Heronbank and Lakeside halls, where you get a lot of ducks and geese on a lake. I loved the library, although my subject was History, which is very different from yours. I wish I could say something about the science department, but knowing Warwick they will have poured money into having the best facilities, to attract top foreign students (as the fees for international students are so high). The uni has a very, very good reputation internationally so the quality of your degree will be recognised in lots of countries. 

Best of luck whichever uni you choose.   ",0,1360070478,null,0,false,0,c89pjv9,t3_17wuy1,t1_c89pjv9,t3_17wuy1,null,1431197831,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

The BoE is the national bank of the UK; despite the name, it is not exclusively an English institution. Along with a proportionate share of the national debt, an independent Scotland would also have claim to a proportionate share of the national assets - that includes entities like the BoE.

The comparison with Spain is misleading; their constitution prohibits unilateral secession, and they have no objection to a consented separation (as is being done). I think the situation would be similar with many countries with secessionist regions; the difference in the UK's case is that the UK is a state formed of four countries, not a country where a local region wishes to form a new country.

true,Godhatesfats,null,null,"Impromptu, probably shitty translation:

I have contacted supporter groups of all 20 Premier League clubs and asked them to nominate a player from their own team. The primary criteria has not been their ability, but what the player's relationship with the supporters, media, referees, teammates and opponents is like. In addition to the thoughts of the supporter groups, I have asked Nettavisen's sports journalists for their opinion, and thus I have both the supporters' and the media's viewpoint on each candidate.

The supporters' judgement: Mackie is the player who gives all for the club. Limited technical ability is compensated for with an attitude on the pitch that players with much higher wages can be envious of. A crowd favourite! He was a strong contributor to QPR's promotion from the Championship, and no self-respecting supporter will ever forget the equalising goal in the away game against Derby County, four minutes over-time; nor the winning goal against Liverpool, three minutes over time.

The journalists' judgement: not a player most people know much about, except that he scores a goal now and then. I was helped a little by TV2's talented commentator Jørgen Klem here, who told me that Mackie is a player who gives all and never complains, who loves playing football, never pronounces himself negatively about anyone and has an attitude the fans love. ""Need more of them. They are few"" (?) said Jørgen. Sounds like a good candidate for this competition, if you ask me.

Do the young have it bad now? Unarguably yes. Prospects now for young people are the lowest for generations *and getting worse*, by macro measures (avg real income, employment, mh problem rates, health disorders, disposable real incomes, etc.)

Most of those who are not supporting the bill seem to argue on a vague sense that it is changing the definition of family, or that it will redefine the concept of a marriage that traditionally is one man and one woman, but that alone doesn't really seem like a reason why, other than just being against change.  

Nadine Dorries gave the most outlandish reason so far, by saying that because a gay relationship cannot end in divorce on the grounds of adultery (sex with a member of the opposite sex) then gay marriage is pretty much encouraging promiscuity, and therefore is not a real marriage.

The only teams that have been constantly in the Champions League over a long period of time have been Chelsea, Man U and Arsenal... of course there have been teams such as Man City, Tottenham and Liverpool playing in the Champions League and it is said that one Liverpool game was alleged to be fixed, so there is a pretty strong case for them.

I am Australian (as indicated by my flair), with an Australian passport and a visa for residency in the UK.

I can travel (mostly) freely in the EU between Schengen States but, since the UK isn't a Schengen State, I get fingerprinted and questioned upon entry. Every single time. I don't have to fly between the UK and Australia, just between the EU and the UK.

&gt; Can you explain what part of that link I'm supposed to be interested in? 

I linked to the exact part in the Wikipedia article that mentions ""Other Nationalities"" crossing CTA borders. It explains that: ""In general, a United Kingdom visa will not allow a traveller entry to Ireland, nor vice-versa."".

So therefore the border between the Republic of Northern Ireland and Northern Ireland might well require border control for people like myself (people who don't hold an EU passport).

Anyway, back to the original comment which caused you to get your knickers in a knot ... I was implying that if Scotland was to leave the UK, then it would possibly join another (non CTA) treaty and therefore have to provide border control - to which I would be subject to.

I don't think anyone in the Scottish Government has ever suggested that there would be direct entry without negotiation - there are obviously things that the UK has negotiated which may not be relevant or which Scotland would not want (it's worth remembering that the UK negotiated them on behalf of Scotland as well as E/W/NI).

The ""accepts reality"" title is a bit misleading: the SNP have always maintained that the relationship with the UK and the EU would both be negotiated pre-independence.

The referendum is to determine if Scotland should become independent: it commits the Scottish and UK governments to finding a solution to that request, but Scotland would remain part of the UK (and EU) until such time as independence took place.

There is an interesting paper from a Commons Select Committee [here](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmfaff/writev/643/m05.htm) - the most relevant points being:

* Arrangements for Scotland’s EU membership would need to be in place simultaneously with independence.
* Scotland’s 5 million people, having been members of the EU for 40 years; have acquired rights as European citizens.
* For practical and political reasons they could not be asked to leave the EU and apply for readmission.
* Negotiations on the terms of membership would take place in the period between the referendum and the planned date of independence.
* The EU would adopt a simplified procedure for the negotiations, not the traditional procedure followed for the accession of non-member countries.

It would be of enormous help if the European Commission could start discussing the process, however they can only do that on the request of a member state.

Once again let me reiterate, about 1% of Muslims are theses radicals, probably less. 1% of 400,000,00 is still quite a few people. I would also say about 1% of Christians are radical and 1% of Hindus and Buddhists etc etc. Any time there is a group who have a single belief there will be the small minority who take it to radical extremes. As for the terrorism that is perputated by radicals who have been brainwashed by radicals who live in afghanistan or such who think they should be attacking us because we are in their country. Britain will never be run by Islam or christianity or hinduism or taoism or nordic pagans, we are a state that brings all these beliefs and creeds together and tries to accomidate for all.

wikipedia:

&gt;English law allows actions for libel to be brought in the High Court for any published statements alleged to defame a named or identifiable individual or individuals in a manner that causes them loss in their trade or profession, or causes a reasonable person to think worse of them. Allowable defenses are justification (the truth of the statement), fair comment (whether the statement was a view that a reasonable person could have held), and privilege (whether the statements were made in Parliament or in court, or whether they were fair reports of allegations in the public interest). An offer of amends is a barrier to litigation. A defamatory statement is presumed to be false unless the defendant can prove its truth. Furthermore, to collect compensatory damages, a public official or public figure must prove actual malice (knowing falsity or reckless disregard for the truth).[citation needed] A private individual must only prove negligence (not using due care) to collect compensatory damages.[citation needed] To collect punitive damages, all individuals must prove actual malice.

&gt; * Both socially and economically, teenagers prefer an anything-goes type situation.
&gt;
&gt; * But as these teenagers grow up a bit and enter the job market, they quickly develop progressive economic ideas: perhaps a bit of ""levelling"" seems pretty good when you're staring up the professional ladder from the bottom rung. Meanwhile, their youthful live-and-let-live social philosophy begins to fade.
&gt;
&gt; * In their late 20s, they start making real money. Economic progressivism goes out the window, preferably out the window of a building with a doorman. As the adult mind turns to more material matters, social views don't change that much.
&gt;
&gt; * Finally, after the mid-40s, retirement looms. Our former teenagers check their collective 401(k)s and think, you know what, let's all get checks from the government. Social views take a hard turn for the more restrictive. At the end of the journey, economic and social views are again in agreement—only this time on the other side of the philosophical line!

As for Jonjo... here are the full quotes pulled from the Soccernet.com article:

&gt;""I played against Stoke and obviously I didn't have too great a game,"" Shelvey said. ""I had a few personal issues that were going on in my life.

&gt;""I didn't think I was the only one that had a bad game that day but I was the one that suffered if you know what I mean. You just have to take it on the chin and work hard in training and try to get myself back in the team which I'm trying to do.""

I personally don't like that he's blaming 'personal issues' for having a poor game and that he's playing the woe-as-me card (though, I do agree that he was unfairly singled out as the scapegoat).

Yes, Shelvey is young. Yes, he has maturing to do. But he needs to learn quickly that these sorts of comments aren't going to help him.

We need to stretch the defense, find ways to make them over commit, we need a bit of incision, and intelligent movement.  A lone striker can pull defenders into tracking his run leaving a pocket of space, but without a second striker who is exploiting that space?

We had no time to negotiate. Chelsea came in and made a big offer, whatever it was it got rejected, that's when Torres submitted a transfer request and the club (for whatever reason agreed to the transfer). From what i've read of the situation Liverpool basically pointed at Carroll and told Chelsea to get him for us and send him along with the whatever cash was left.
The same restrictions were placed on Newcastle as well. They lost arguably their most effective player with no time to replace him so they came up with a massive price to put us off but when the fee was agreed upon they simply couldn't say no. It was a record sum. If the transfer occurred a week or two earlier Carroll's price would have been only somewhat miraculous, rather than outrageously ridiculous.
As for Chelsea giving more, that's all down to it being Chelsea, Abramovich wanted Torres and he was willing to pay whatever it took.

The reason the transfer took so long to happen despite a whole years' worth of interest was Torres simply wasn't interested in leaving us. The situation with the ownership really got to him.

Even on sale, seems like a lot of money to pay for something that's going to wash off; so those interested in buying kits might be better off waiting for the next round or buying the older Adidas kits somewhere else. (I think they look a bit better than the present kit anyway to be honest).

2. If you buy via the official site, be careful. I tried to buy with my VISA, but it didn't have verified by Visa, so I was told the payment didn't go through. I used Paypal to buy the stuff instead, but then I later discovered that LFC had tried to put they VISA payment through anyway (three times), and my bank saw that as fraudulent and automatically cancelled my card...big pain the ass. Long story short: just pay with a Mastercard or Paypal if you don't/can't set up Verified by VISA for your visa card.

That said, I haven't bought a kit but all the other stuff I've bought from the official site has been excellent quality, and the speed at which they ship to the US is frankly ridiculous (fast).",0,1360084363,null,0,false,0,c89t2kc,t3_17xoe7,t1_c89t2kc,t3_17xoe7,null,1431199607,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Conveniently for you, the 47 attacks you mention are not grouped by perpetrator. Portraying them all as the work of Muslims is, however, misleading because it is almost certainly not the case.

I will not deny that British Muslim culture at large has major issues with gay people, amongst others.

I'm currently in the process of setting up my own ethical housing association with a few other investors in South West London, we intend to use our combined purchasing power to purchase large derelict properties, such as factories etc (of which there are many in this area, some abandoned for over 50 years), and turn them into very affordable, clean and good conditioned flats to rent out, either privately or to the council.

There's various personal reasons we are all doing this, but the main issue we face is that councils simply aren't interested.
