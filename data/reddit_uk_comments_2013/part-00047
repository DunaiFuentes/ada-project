Most people consider atheism to be a solid belief that there is no god though. They don't see atheist and non-theist as the same. They see the ""a-"" prefix as referring to the absence of a god rather than the lack of belief, as per its most common understanding.

The atheist label is at best, rather confusing, when you could be a lot clearer identifying as a non-theist.

true,spursdude92,flair5,,"Defoe had a fantastic start to the season. I've been a long-time critic of his. Many of my friends always thought I was annoying when I went on about how useless he was. So when he started the season so brightly they pointed to that and tried to tell me how wrong I am.

He is now without a goal in so long I can't remember the last time he scored. Last season, he barely scored any goals and it looks like a return to that form from him - to no surprise on my part. 

Some people may be fair weathered fickle fans - but I have never rated Defoe, and the moment we sold Berbatov have said we've needed to buy an actual striker. Since then we have not done so, and it has shown dramatically on our goal-scoring records for our Strikers since. Defoe has only scored 46 goals since coming to us in the 2008-2009 January transfer Window. so in 4 years he's scored 46 goals. That amounts to about 11-12 per year. That is not what you want you main striker to have for you. 

To compare, we have had Ade for under 2 seasons now, and he has scored 19 goals total. That is about 9-10 goals per season. That is not too much worse than Defoe, yet people on here seem to think he's useless but Defoe is not. Ade has had (until recently) a better work-rate, and actually seemed to have an effect on games he was in. Looking at the Liverpool game yesterday - the only effect Defoe had was to make sure we lost, as he did next to nothing going forward.

I'm well aware there are some fair weathered fans, but I am not one of them. I'm just a realist

Edit: also, if you take into account their goals/appearances then Defoe looks just as mediocre as Ade:

* Ade: 19 goals in 49 games - a scoring percentage of 38.8% (3.s.f)
* Defoe: 46 goals in 116 games - a scoring percentage of 39.7% (3.s.f) - so he is not significantly better at all.",0,1363000908,null,0,1363001233,0,c8tk75u,t3_1a18gd,t1_c8tk75u,t1_c8t9woc,null,1431549086,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

There is a segregated network of cycle paths, although these are not as good as Holland's, and access into London by train is very fast (now as little as 35 minutes, I think).

- Council tax cut paid for by axeing landfill tax and cull of town hall ""non jobs"". The defence equipment budget will be doubled to £8bn, £3.5bn will be spent on nuclear power plants to provide 50% of energy, and more prisons will be built.
- Work permits to be time-limited and overstaying made a crime. No amnesty for illegal immigrants: all returned to home country.
- Double prison places and create ""boot camps"" for young offenders.
- Matrons to run hospitals, not non-clinically trained managers.
- Free eye tests and dental checks.
- Non means-tested ""basic cash benefit"" for low earners and unemployed. Jobseekers allowance ... is scrapped.
- Child benefit for the first three children only.
- Build 200mph rail lines from London to Newcastle and Exeter.

The bad;

- End active promotion of the doctrine of multiculturalism.
- Scrap the ""politically correct"" Crown Prosecution Service and return to local police prosecutions.
- Arm four new submarines with US nuclear missiles.
- Franchise out key services including hospitals and GP surgeries to companies and charities.
- Create voucher system to allow people to opt out of NHS system entirely.
- Smoking rooms in pubs.
- ... incapacity benefit is scrapped.
- No benefits for anyone who has not lived in the UK for five years.
- Support coal-fired power and oppose wind farms.
- Stop funding UN's climate change panel.
- Ban schools from showing Al Gore's film, An Inconvenient Truth.

These are all my own personal choices of good and bad policies, of course.  Others will no doubt disagree.  Whilst I think something needs to be done to control immigration, I have no problem with Britain being multicultural.  I also think it would be wrong to franchise out NHS services (seems like privatisation by the back door).  I do agree with UKIP on putting matrons in charge though.  There's too many non-clinical managers in the NHS who just don't seem to know what they're doing.  We need more prison places, that's a fact regardless of which party you support.  

My biggest disagreements with UKIP are their energy policies.  Coal?  No thanks.  It might be good for jobs, but its poor for the environment.  Wind farms are ugly but we need them.  I agree with UKIP on investing in nuclear power.  I believe the Tories promised to build nuclear power stations (I think), but that seems to have evaporated.

I also agree with UKIP on more defence spending - mainly because I think it's shitty to keep cutting army jobs when our soldiers have been serving this country so faithfully.  I'm not sure I agree with buying more nukes for subs though.  I mean, what's the point?  I believe we do need a nuclear deterrent, but given the economic climate, it seems silly to waste more money on nukes that are just going to sit on subs that float around doing nothing for decades.  

UKIP also seem to be in denial of climate change, which is a shame.  Given that we've had serious flooding almost every summer for the last several years, it seems silly that any political party would want to continue to deny that climate change is happening.

I'm sorry that you feel that we deceived you, however,  I would like to set the record straight and answer a few points from your email.

The paperwork for the machine ie the log book, owners manual, spare key and all other service history for the bike were lost by another member of staff not myself and we did notify you of this at the very first point of the sale. At the time of the purchase we serviced the bike to make up for the lack of service history and did contact the dealer it was serviced at before it came in part exchange to us, only for them to tell us that they dont keep records of servicing and couldnt help us. We would obviously never falsify service history so to that end there was no way of recovering any previous service history. 

The owners manual was ordered at the time of sale and went on back order on Honda UK's system for a long period of time, only to eventually show this week as a non orderable, obselete part with no supercession. Since this I am currently looking out on Ebay for an owners manual but have to date not sourced one as yet.

The spare key is not a problem to sort at all. I have this morning ordered a key blank from our spares department which will be sent to you, once you receive this it can be cut by a key engraver local to yourself from the spare key to which we are more than happy to re imburse the cost of.

In the pursuit of customer happiness and customer service, if there is anything at all which you think can help the situation or aid you further then please do not hesitate to get in touch.

Not sure what the next step is, guess I'll get a spare key cut and try to sell it and move on.

They ""serviced"" it. Liars. They didn't notice the rear disc warpage or that the rear calliper needed a service. Spent ~£200 on getting a proper mechanic to fix it and a few other things.

For anyone in Bristol area:

Are the best at servicing and picking up bits like lube/coolant etc. They are what I'd consider proper mechanics, they ride and they have a great service.

1 - save the component images onto your own computer (there are two... a square one with the DW logo, and the larger one with part of the DW logo on the bottom left). It may help to name them 'big' and 'small' to help in Step 4 onwards.

2 - Go to your own personal Facebook page by clicking on your name at the top of your Facebook News Feed page.

3 - hover your mouse over the smaller picture you have. Click on Edit Profile Picture.

4 - choose Upload Photo, and choose the smaller of the images you saved from Imgur in step 1. Give it time to upload and display.

5 - hover your mouse over the larger picture you have. Click on Change Cover.

6 - choose Upload Photo, and choose the larger of the images you saved from Imgur. Give it time to upload and display. Do NOT reposition the image... it's already aligned correctly.

7 - if the translation capabilities of a TARDIS are not available to you, try saying ""Pomogite! Ya ne khochu okazatʹsya v lovushke v russkoy podvodnoy lodki!"". Or show them this text: Помогите!

If there was suitable housing available we'd move like a shot, we'd save a fortune on gas bills for a start.  However for me, and a large number of other people there are no suitable properties to move to.  The policy is poorly thought out and despite Dave's 'Big Society' rhetoric is going to cause hardship to a lot of people.  All to save 0.3% of the total welfare bill.

For example you can believe in a god or gods while holding the view that you don't or can't know if they actually exist or not. You can also not believe in gods and think the same.

Most people when they say they are a agnostic actually mean they are a agnostic atheist and what people tend to think of as atheist it's really some degree of gnostic atheism. 

As such the agnostic/gnostic line is something that can be debated because it's about the limit of knowledge if such a thing can logically exist, and this is in fact what most of these debates centre around. The only way atheism/theism actually factor in to this is if you an prove that we can know if god/s exists or not (gnostic) and you are then able to prove the existence one way or another. At which point either atheism or theism are no longer valid views as they are not longer a case of belief but fact. If you don't think god/s can be proven or dis-proven then the atheist/theist debate can never be logically resolved.

So I'm bored and fancied some sums, thought I'd chip in. UKIP wants a flat tax of 31% a year for people earning more than £11,500.

Let's take two cases - a person earning £100,000 a year, and another person earning £12,000 a year.

31% tax means:
&gt;£100k a year = £31k Tax = £69k take home money (£5,700 a month)

&gt;£12k a year = £3,720 Tax = £8,280 take home money (£690 a month)

Of course, the richer person earning £100k pays a hell of a lot more tax, but they still take home a good slice of money. Our less well-off friend pays a little tax, but takes home less money.

Now consider how much food costs. Imagine we could feed each person adaquetely for £60 a week (£240 for an average month). Now the food cost is only 4.2% of the richer person's budget, but the food is 34.8% of the poor person's budget, which is a lot. Yes it might be said the richer person could buy nicer food, but to be comparable to the poorer person, they'd spend £1983.60 a month on food - which is a lot of corn flakes.

So the tax is regressive because while the richer person objectively pays more money, the proportion they spend is much less, and the poorer person pays a far higher proportion of their income than the richer person. Some people argue that this is the incentive poorer people need to earn more money, but some people argue this is unfair against poorer people.",1,1363005639,null,0,1363009528,0,c8tkszc,t3_1a2qql,t1_c8tkszc,t1_c8tkjpc,null,1435570104,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

In any other location on land or sea the enemy can always know where your nukes are. If they're well-enough organised and powerful they could, theoretically at least, take out those nuclear weapons before they could be used.

However a nuclear-powered submarine is to all intents and purposes completely undetectable once it's underwater. That means its missiles could be anywhere in the world at any time, and there's no way at all to carry out a pre-emptive strike on them. The nuclear submarine is really designed to be the ultimate deterrent because it's a weapon of last resort -- you can fire its missiles even if the entire host country has been vapourised.

http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/0313/11032013-meeting

An organisation known as the Islamic Education and Research Academy (IERA) booked a room at UCL for a debate on Saturday evening (9 March). UCL was notified during Friday by some individuals planning to attend the event that the organisers intended to segregate the audience by gender.

This was directly contrary to UCL policy. We do not allow enforced segregation on any grounds at meetings held on campus. We immediately made clear to the organisers that the event would be cancelled if there were any attempt to enforce such segregation. We also required the organisers to make it explicit to attendees that seating arrangements were optional, and guests were welcome to sit wherever they felt comfortable. We also arranged for additional security staff to be present to ensure that people were not seated against their wishes.

It now appears that, despite our clear instructions, attempts were made to enforce segregation at the meeting. We are still investigating what actually happened at the meeting but, given IERA’s original intentions for a segregated audience we have concluded that their interests are contrary to UCL’s ethos and that we should not allow any further events involving them to take place on UCL premises.

Thus the new (at the time) law couldn't apply to everyone without contraindicating an existing law which kinda shouldn't happen.

So the law about helmets had to involve a caveat to account for this.

So it's not actually Sikhism per-say just that's the best know example - I am very surprised the highway code book specifically mentions Sikh.

As a young journalist, the word which is constantly drilled into us is the big C - 'Convergence'.

As reporters, we're expected to be able to write compelling copy, edit video to broadcast quality, edit and present audio media and increasingly work with HTML/CSS etc. The industry is in the same mindset. It's no longer 'The Guardian Newspaper' it's the 'Guardian Medias'. 

The problem is we hit a solid consumer wall when it comes to quality versus demand for crap. This is because of the internet based ad-revenue system. To run an investigation into a rumored political scandal, for example, carries huge costs. An amount will be set aside within the legal budgets, to cover any libel (Britain is awful for its ease of libelous claims) or other slip-ups. The cost of the man-hours needed to carry out a detailed investigation will need to be factored in (which detracts from the ability of the involved reporters to write other stories) and the clincher is people don't read that kind of story in great enough numbers!

I mean, perhaps the relatively educated, politically aware readers of Reddit would - but the general readership (of websites in particular; which require no buy-in) don't care enough about a quality 5,000 word expose into political scandal. They want to read about [the fucking Twilight author's feelings on true love](http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2013/mar/11/stephenie-meyer-twilight-the-host). 

And the more clicks a story gets, the more ad-revenue it nets the business. It's that simple. 

So it comes down to lots of revenue for very little effort versus not much revenue for lots of time and money. That is why there is a defense for pay-walls. 

Newspapers, in all likelihood, will continue to exist only as specialist limited release 'magazines'; becoming more akin to Newsweek and Time. That is, unless they can successfully transfer to Kindles and Tablets wholesale. The next decade or will be the be-all or end-all for paper news I feel.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"&gt;In the workplace you see a colleague being bullied...

This is not an accurate analogy. It would be the same if you had a duty not to do anything about it and if you did you would be heavily criticised. Even so this analogy depends on politics anyway. It assumed the government is bullying the public which most of the Conservative party would disagree with. Your saying it's wrong for the Queen not to be left wing and therefore disagree with the government. She is welcome to agree or disagree but she is not welcome to make her preference public. It undermines the people who actually have democratic legitimacy. She doesn't have any and therefore should not comment on politics. And yes, being political is linked to public statements. She cannot undermine the government if know one knows what she thinks. 

When I said those words are not chosen lightly what I was saying was that the words are chosen specifically to show that it is the government who is speaking. Her input is therefore transparently meaningless. The words are chosen to show she has no input. 

&gt;she isn't invoking Muhammed

Unless you missed the last 500 year this country is officially a Christian country. I know it's backwards and I hope the church will be disestablished in the future but you can't act all surprised when the Supreme Governor of the church invokes Christianity and not other religions.  

&gt;the queen is inherently arrogant and masochistic?

I don't know, ask her. If she really believes what says they arguably yes. She would believe she is a sinner etc but also that the world was made with her in mind. Or she may not believe it whether through lies or having never questioned it. She is just like a large number of people in that respect and I don't see how it's relevant. The PM is also a Christian. It's a fact of life and we've made it through broadly OK so far. 

&gt;thinks her family is special enough...but he doesn't care

Depending what you mean by special, she has good reason to think her family is special. A huge majority of the public favour her being the monarch. Last time we didn't have a monarch in Cromwell's day we asked to have on again. If you mean by special that she thinks she can defy government or the will of the people, we cleared up last time that she has no such right and I doubt she thinks she does. 

&gt;grant power above a commoner

Many of those things grant power above a commoner, though the power to declare war is exercised by the PM not the Queen and with teh consent of Parliament, nor is she functionally head of the military as the PM is the only one who can order troops. However it's not your argument that she simply has more power and access than you or me, or course she does but most of it is simply ceremonial like being head of the armed forces and the power to warn and encourage etc is not exactly potent. Effectively she can advise the government and if they are stupid enough to follow her instructions then we have a poor government. 

What you said was that she 'gave her tacit approval to' government policies by not speaking out against them as she is not supposed to do. Your argument that she has too much power and in principle should be removed can be as correct as you like and i'm inclined to agree with them but you going against as large majority of UK citizens who don't agree and you also trying to strengthen you argument by attributing political views to her that you see as bad. What if she was the greatest champion of the poor ever and gave all her wealth away to help the people? If you are a republican you should agree that it makes no difference, she is a monarch and should go. Similarly it would make no difference if you were right about her supporting policies that hurt the poor, the arguments for her removal are apolitical based on the legitimacy of power. Despite all that i'm not convinced she has ever done anything to indicate her politics. She never opposed the NHS or the welfare state, she didn't opposed joining the EU, nor did she oppose cutting funds to the NHS and austerity. You can either assume that by staying silent she is tacitly agreeing to all these things thereby contradicting yourself because she would support opposing policies proposed by opposing parties or you can assume she is trying to be as non-political as possible and therefore we cant infer anything from her non-action.

Additionally, it wasn't really suitable for receiving clients (I am a business consultant). Anyway, we moved house and found a property with a load of land at the back, and thereupon I built an office - one of those large, luxury log-cabin-type things. It has two rooms - a large one which can comfortably seat 4 people for a training seminar, and my office which is about 10ft x 12ft. It is idyllic. Cost me about £30k altogether, including furnishings, but no overheads, minimal maintenance.

Many years ago I faced a daily commute of one and a half hours and I hated every second of it. It was tiring and I constantly felt like I was wasting my life. Some days I would actually hide in the office until everyone was gone and spend the night there, just because I couldn't face the journey. Would hate to go back to that.

Quite correct. Basic linguistic scholarship point here—it's an example which means we can do the following: 

&gt; ~~This is not an accurate analogy. It would be the same if you had a duty not to do anything about it and if you did you would be heavily criticised. Even so this analogy depends on politics anyway. It assumed the government is bullying the public which most of the Conservative party would disagree with.~~

People can be political by inaction, and I missed the obvious of Elizabeth Windsors inaction around abdicating. The fact that she accepts her roles as head of the church, government, lives in a billion pound house, is a political position. The battle of republicanism against monarchy is inescapably political, and there is no greater monarchist than the queen, I can tell by her silly hat.

&gt; Supreme Governor of the church invokes Christianity and not other religions

Oh, so the queen is now a supreme governor so she has power after all? We can finally end this conversation with agreement.

&gt; ...or course she does but most of it is simply ceremonial..

Ahh, so she isn't completely ceremonial. Again we agree!

&gt; declaring war

Even if it is the PM that declares war, and we just don't know if this is the case because the debate doesn't happen i public, that means the PM effectively uses or abuses the monarch to become the monarch himself. The monarchy actually shut down a bill that would have transferred powers away from itself and to parliament:

&gt; The bill became Bill 35 in the 1998/1999 Parliamentary session, and was initially scheduled for second reading on 16 April 1999. As a bill modifying the monarch's prerogative powers, the Queen's consent was required before it could be debated in Parliament. This is perhaps the only remaining situation in which the Sovereign is directly and substantively involved in the process of a Bill becoming an Act of Parliament, in contrast to the ceremonial act of granting Royal Assent to a Bill.

true,Traumend,eng-devon,Okehampton,"I'm rather disappointed by most of the comments here to be totally honest, it looks like reddit is just spewing a pile of pretentious bullcrap instead of actually looking into the points and having a civilised conversation about it.

Personally i'm still on the fence about UKIP, I agree with the majority of the values they want to achieve but realistically I have no idea what they would implement and how as well as not being as educated on the economy as I would like to be. I'll give my opinions on each section...

**Tax and Economy**: As I said before I am not 100% in the know when it comes to what works and what doesn't here, but the flatline ABOVE £11,500 seems pretty fair. It is giving leeway for those below whilst making sure everyone else is on equal footing surely?

I'm not a great fan of people loosing their jobs and 2 million seems like a large amount considering they can't even guarantee that these other new jobs would magically appear for them.

Increase in nuclear power and prisons is more than welcome, i'm just worried about the cost.

**Immigration**: I agree with all of the ideas here, I can't understand why so many people can simply ignore the fact that the country is becoming overpopulated and it is effecting our every day lives through the cost of welfare and the oversaturation of schools and hospitals (We see news of the NHS struggling almost daily.). 

These seemingly strict laws can't be enforced entirely and I would have thought UKIP would take this into account, you are never going to be able to achieve the number you want as people are being smuggled in so this freeze? It will stop the vast majority.

I also agree with ending the doctrine of multiculturalism, not because I dislike anyone before you guys start calling me horrid names but becuase I don't see why this issue should be made in the first place. We're all human beings at the end of the day and we shouldn't be monitoring the levels of what culture are where... The 50,000 can come as they please and I don't care what culture they are of, as long as there arn't too many of them.

**Crime**: Life should mean life, either they should change the name of make it fit the wording. Anyone who gets a sentence like that deserves it if they are guilty and I have heard far too many tales of people getting of lightly and just recommitting. 

The big worry if they do go ahead with this is the prison space, I can't imagine they would be able to build enough prisons to contain the massive influx of people. Deportation should be a no-brainer, and the boot camps seem like a great idea as i'm all for fixing the behavior instead of simply sending them to prison. 

Also nice to hear the term politically correct being scrapped on the justice side of things. 

**Defence**: Now, this I don't agree with fully. Spending is a massive issue at the moment and unless we plan for all out war I have no idea how this would help in any way. The increase in jobs is great but the new subs and aircraft carriers seems like a large waste of money. 

**Health**: Not knowledgeable on the franchise side of things so I can't really comment. Opting out of NHS, nice idea better than without. Giving power to matrons seems like a good idea as more often than not they would be more quilified. Free eye and dental checks would be great, just a little worried about the decrease of funding. Smoking in pubs I don't really agree with, I am not a smoker and hope the habit will be kicked by more and more people but at the end of the day a large number do smoke.

**Welfare**: Jobseekers and incapacity benifits can be taken advantage of easily so a simpler benefit system is more than welcome. I don't belive that people popping out children on a regular basis should be a way to earn more money, you should have children based on what you can support, and I totally agree with the lack of benefits for people staying in the country for the first five years as it stops people coming over simply for the benefits.

**Enviroment**: These are the points I agree with the least. We should be moving away from coal full stop, but the silver lining would be an increase of jobs I guess. I am all for wind power but I can sympathise with those that have to live with them.

Funding being sent out of the country is more often than not a bad thing regardless. 

And ""An Inconvenient Truth""... I have no idea where to stand on this, I see most of the comments have instantly jumped on this bullet point with sharp fangs but I want to see their reasoning behind this. Maybe it's just becase they don't want potentially fear mongering programming shown in schools instead of them refusing the belive that global warming exists? But again I don't know enough about the issue.

Electric cars are the way of the future, good for them.

And finally the train, it would be handy but odds are it will cost a rather large amount. As someone who lives near Exeter I can sure for sure this would help and it would also stop a large amount of traffic. I'm just not sure if it is worth the investment.

I am looking forward to seeing what you guys think of these points and if there are any misconceptions or pieces of misinformation please say.

The main pro point for this is a longer barrel for the rifle size, which can increase accuracy. Though I've seen complaints about reloading compared to AR style. 

AK uses a different calibre from M4 and SA80. 7.62x39 vs the 5.56 (SA80). This is a debate in itself. 

I find it interesting however our special forces are pictured (on the rare case they are) almost exclusively with C8's (Canadian M4).  This might be for anonymity of not using a British rifle, or it might be because its better. 

Edit: triggers on bullpups are apparently not great, SA80 can't fire left handed without hot brass in your face .",0,1363017507,null,0,1363018850,0,c8tnkjj,t3_1a348l,t1_c8tnkjj,t3_1a348l,null,1431550723,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

[In his statement to the inquiry, Professor Brian Jarman, who devised The Hospital Standardised Mortality Ratio, argued that the figure of between 400 and 1200 ""excess deaths"" at Mid Staffs was not one that he recognised] (http://fullfact.org/factchecks/francis_many_deaths_unnecessarily_at_mid_staffs-28805)


It would also do you well to learn that using personal insults and course language adds nothing to a debate and actually makes you seem quite ignorant. you may apologise in your own time.


It might be appropriate to allow Robert Francis QC the final word:
""...it is in my view misleading and a potential misuse of the figures to extrapolate from them a conclusion that any particular number, or range of numbers of deaths were caused or contributed to by inadequate care."" and ""it would be unsafe to infer from the figures that there was any particular number or range of numbers of avoidable or unnecessary deaths at the Trust.""

As for the F-35 there is two variants the F-35 and the F-35A, one being capable of vertical take off meaning we could have shorter aircraft carriers. I'm can't remember off the top of my head which type of aircraft carrier they are building now since they seem to be forever changing it. I personally think we was too soon scrapping the old ones as we didn't have anything to replace them with for another 10 years and a aircraft carrier is very important for a nation to project its power. For example if the Falklands were taken by Argentina I very much doubt we would be able to win them back currently. The harrier was still a capable aircraft but was scrapped really for the F-35.

I know that a big reason people want a female Doctor is because there aren't any Time Ladies running around... but there's one that I hope comes back soon. Romana. For those who don't know, she was a Companion for The Fourth Doctor. At first, she had to make sure that he got The Key to Time. Once that was taken care of, she kinda became a renegade like The Doctor since, well, she hung out with him for so long. She has the most badass reason for leaving The Doctor: she wanted to protect a universe.

Here's where it gets a little tricky. Our universe has an antimatter universe (not the alternate one that Rose is in). There are articles that can explain antimatter far better than I can, so I won't go into that. There's a universe between our universe and the antimatter universe called ""E-Space"" (not the alternate one that Rose is in). The Doctor and Romana went there twice. One time involved them fighting the last vampires, which was awesome. Millennia ago, there was a long-fought war between Time Lords and vampires that was so bloody and terrible, Gallifrey swore off violence (until the Time War). The last vampires managed to slip into E-Space. Anywho, the second time The Doctor and Romana went to E-Space, she decided to stay behind and protect the few inhabitants of it.

Depending on who you ask, Romana is either still in E-Space or some other thing after the Time War. The audio dramas say that she's president, but Rassilon was president in ""The End of Time"", and that took place at the end of the Time War (sorta). I'd like to think that Romana is still alive and tucked away somewhere because she was a great character and it'd be stupid to not use her again.

There comes a time when that other country doesn't want to support you, then you're shit out of luck. Aircraft carriers are necessary for operations where we don't have a nearby land base to launch interceptions from, they're necessary as part of naval battlegroups, they're necessary for observation and long range defence of battlegroups.

There is some very dangerous 'green' organisations with some very murky practises and ideas run by fascists and eugenicists. This is a quote from the Club Of Rome which is a 'green' organisation founded in 1968.

""1991, the Club published The First Global Revolution.[5] According to this book, divided nations require common enemies to unite them, ""either a real one or else one invented for the purpose.""[6] Because of the sudden absence of traditional enemies, ""new enemies must be identified.""[6] ""In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill....All these dangers are caused by human intervention, and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome. The real enemy then, is humanity itself.""[7]""

This is the kind of thing or people we should be worried about.

I know the strategic benefits and uses of aircraft carries, but our budget and requirements does not call for 5 of them and the associated aircraft.

Lastly, Argentina can try the Falklands all they want but they will never successfully invade without decimating their entire military. In 1982 there had pretty much no defenses and 80 soldiers, now there has type 45 destroyers, 1200 personal and 4 eurofighters. Along with all the accompanying anti-air and defensive capabilities. Plus there is nuclear submarines within range of the Falklands to help if need be, and will decimate a naval landing force if needed.

In comparison the Argentine army has not really advanced much since 1982 in which they managed to lose to an attacking army operating extreme distances from home. So, all in all - Falklands V2 not going to happen despite anything Argentina might say or do.

Journalism is going to have to adapt to this change. At the moment they are doing silly things like pay walls which are doomed to failure before you start because they are not exploiting the transformative power of the internet and somebody eventually will. Whatever the new distribution system looks like it won't be simply mimicking standing journals but online.

The main form of new competitive advantage we are seeing with the internet is via a Steam like content portal (which is both cheaper than the traditional model and gives creators more of their money). Such a creation has many successful examples in existence already. However I don't think selling journals on Steam is the answer. I think it'll be something more like a subscription service where journalists get paid per view.

Obviously doing this alone won't be enough. You'll need the social structure around it. You can attach discussion threads directly to articles.

Let me explain. 
I'm discounting anyone under 22 straight off the bat, they have time to improve. 
Technically he's got it all, good passer, good shot and good pace and engine. 
However, he has no drive or cutting edge. I've never seen a winger gain so little space against the defender in my life. He dithers and dithers on the ball, and can be read like a book. He's indecisive and plays boring football.
 His crosses are atrocious. He either pings them into he box, but no where near our player, or floats the ball in like a snail making for an easy clearance. 

I don't feel he adds much to the team at all, that a half decent competent winger couldn't do for half the wages. 

Compared to the rest of the squad he's in my opinion the worst. He's playing okay at the moment, but he's played poorly for way too long, and even his current form isn't what a top 4 aspiring team wants.

I study law and one of the key reasons why it was introduced was due to the police doing a poor job and manipulating the justice service in order to get convictions. Granted i can see how that could be a good thing, but the whole point of the justice service is that it is just, so having the same people who arrest you prosecuting you simply isn't right. Having the CPS allows for specialized people for convictions and ensures that practices are done correctly. And gives an objective organisation the chance to see whether or not it is worth the tax payers money taking the person to trial where they might not succeed.

That and along with the repeal of the Human Rights Act is quite worrying, not sure where they plan to go in the terms of justice, as well as what their idea of justice is. Just my thoughts. 

Oh and the term life is a grey area slightly, since murder has a mandatory life sentence when found guilty, there's generally mitigating circumstances that make the crime not as bad as say cold blooded murder so generally its there in order to ensure that justice is given but that it is also fair in circumstances where flat out life would be a bit harsh.

Yes we do. The PM must ask parliament before declaring war. There is a public debate in the Commons. For example in Libya the commons [debated the action then voted 557 to 13.](http://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2011/march/debate-on-military-action-in-libya/) It's not the Queen who uses the power. It derives from her but like any other political prerogative it is only exercised by the PM. 

The bill that was shot down was, if you read the page you linked, prevented from moving forward by 'The Queen, acting upon the advice of her government'. It was the government telling her not to. Now I can't fathom why but that was the case. As with any action the Queen takes politically she is acting as a puppet for the government.

Eight months for a lying, scheming MP who ignores the laws he helps enact is quite sufficient.

You just removed 2 million jobs - that's a cost saving.

    I can't understand why so many people can simply ignore the fact that the country is becoming overpopulated and it is effecting our every day lives through the cost of welfare and the oversaturation of schools and hospitals (We see news of the NHS struggling almost daily.).

Please advise how it is affecting our welfare, schools and hospitals? Reading a tabloid opinion piece is not relevant. Unless you have proof of your financial welfare, education or healthcare being affected due to immigration I'm calling this inflammatory.

   ...as long as there arn't too many of them.

This is probably due to your misunderstanding of the effects of immigration.

    I have heard far too many tales of people getting of lightly and just recommitting.

For Life sentences? I've not.

    Deportation should be a no-brainer...

You've made an assumption the excess will be illegal immigrants.

    ...I totally agree with the lack of benefits for people staying in the country for the first five years as it stops people coming over simply for the benefits.

This encourages long-term immigration for families if you give it more than a moments thought, also it would justify scrapping the Human Rights Act as it would allow them to just negligently die on the street (oh wait, these people survived war, genocide from countries without civil rights?

To cover 18bn increase in defence spend (40% of 46bn), 8bn in cuts to combined NI/Income tax revenue (from combined 32% to 31%), 50bn from cutting employers contribution to NI (my estimate of half), 4bn to double number of prison spend. Means they are looking at finding 76bn through Welfare cuts, VAT raises, and corp tax raises.

Even if they halved welfare, by halving unemployment payments (saving 31bn) with their basic cash benefit, and halving social exclusion benefits to the especially vulnerable (including sending the buggers back or however they word it). They'd still need to raise another 40ish bn, from VAT and Corp tax.

That would be something like 25bn by raising VAT to **25%!** and 15 bn from raising corp tax by **4%** to 24% to small businesses, or 31% to large.

This is, of course, if none of those raises and cuts, affects economic output negatively.

To cover 18bn increase in defence spend (40% of 46bn), 8bn in cuts to combined NI/Income tax revenue (from combined 32% to 31%), 50bn from cutting employers contribution to NI (my estimate of half), 4bn to double number of prison spend. Means they are looking at finding 76bn through Welfare cuts, VAT raises, and corp tax raises.

Even if they halved welfare, by halving unemployment payments (saving 31bn) with their basic cash benefit, and halving social exclusion benefits to the especially vulnerable (including sending the buggers back or however they word it). They'd still need to raise another 40ish bn, from VAT and Corp tax.

That would be something like 25bn by raising VAT to 25%! and 15 bn from raising corp tax by 4% to 24% to small businesses, or 31% to large.

This is, of course, if none of those raises and cuts, affects economic output negatively.

true,Nowimnotalurker,flair-norwichcity,"Ruddy marvellous ","Literally all you need to know about norwich is that we are a club which although having experienced tremendous highs such as the 92/93 season (I might well be one out) when we finished third in the first season of the premiership, has, certainly since the turn of the century been one that has had rare forays into the premiership (the 04/05 and our current one (promoted after the 10/11 season)), however has been primarily a championship club. After the club went into a bit of a financial crisis following our relegation after the 04/05, the club had been in a poor phase, culminating with our relegation into league 1 (the 3rd tier of English football) after the 08/09 season. Things were looking grim, and were not helped by loosing our first game in League 1 7-1 to Colchester, who were managed by one Mr. Paul Lambert.

The club soon Hired lambert, and experienced two seasons of consecutive promotion, resulting in the club coming back to the premiership for the start of the 11/12 season! With debts nearly paid off, things were looking rosy again for Norwich, and indeed we finished 12th in the table that season, with Grant Holt, who had been instrumental in our promotion from league one and the championship, scoring 15 goals in that season.

I'm not sure when you started following us, or know about the club's activities last summer, so I'll do a quick recap!

Things very quickly went from looking rather good to rather scary for the club. Paul lambert, after 3 wildly successful years, left the club to join Aston Villa, and Grant Holt, our captain and our star player, put in a transfer request. The club did well, however, in appointing manager Chris Hughton, who convinced Holt to sign a new contract, and as a result of increased revenue resulting from television rights etc. in the premier league, was able to bring in a number of quality players, with Robert Snodgrass and Sebastien Bassong being arguably the pick of the bunch - indeed Bassong (who's transfer was estimated to be ~£4bn - the most NCFC have ever spent on a player) becoming crucial to the Canaries' much improved defense this season.

1. We look at Lukaku as 2/3 years away from becoming a serious candidate to start for us and behave accordingly. First we offload Torres for whatever price we can get for him. Next we bring in a proven veteran, for me ideally one who has more than 2/3 years in him because putting all our eggs in the Lukaku basket at this point seems like a big mistake. On top of that, considering how many games we play, if Lukaku develops the way we want him to, having 2 world class strikers probably isn't such a bad idea.

2. Yes, and yes. He certainly comes back, frankly we need CM more than anything. We play with two, and since Romeu doesn't seem to be a factor I'd argue we only actually have two (Mike &amp; Lampard). Honestly it's not even Lampard's ideal position so I'll say we have 1.5. Essien could put in a really useful shift for us, I think this year he's shown he can be a reliable squad player in that role. However I still think we need a second CM which leads me to...

3. I'm not sure he will leave Madrid anyway, but if he does I don't think it sensible to be splashing out 30 mil to keep players away from other teams. However, I think there is certainly an argument to be made for us needing him. If we can finally commit to Mikel at DM, then utilizing Modric in the deeplying playmaker role (the role he played at Spurs) could be effective.

Oswin held on tight. Not to anything she could grab, but to her thoughts, her memories. The good times that made her happy and glad to be alive. Although, at the back of her mind something lingered. Something dark and sketchy. Something not quite there but more real than anything she could ever remember. She pushed it back. She did what the Doctor said, because all boys and girls know to follow the Doctors orders. After all, he said to hold on to a When, not a What, and that image, that feeling, was definitely a what.
The T.A.R.D.I.S. slipped in it's special way. Turning ninety degrees from every direction at once and at the same time pulling back into and down on itself. This happened so fast that the average mind could not see it, could not comprehend it. To compensate, the brain viewed this as a blinking into and out of sight. But to the Doctor, and to Oswin, it was easy to see what was happening. Easy to appreciate possibility colliding with curiosity on the horizon of imagination and certainty.

And if they wanted to do a memory rewind they'd do something similar as like they did in the big bang two. Remember he says that he'd rather skip the rewind. 

I think degeneration would leave more questions than answered. 

Though the whole ""Silence will fall"" reminds me of Martha's episode with William Shakespeare, the power in a name. Dolorian seems to imply just knowing the Doctors real name would allow the wielder of such a name power over him. Though whether it's over his entire lifetime or just his future (at least I don't think) is ever fully explained. Which might be a window into previous regens/past that way...though with Moffat's completely writing out previous companions/Doctors I highly doubt any of the actors will return. (that and there's an article that Sylvester and Tom weren't approached for parts to come back for the 50th) and time after time when Moffat had the ability to write in the actors back in (""is there someone I haven't ruined?"" Only promo images of previous companions appeared/my own theory that Moffat seriously wants nothing to do with previous Who good guys and just previous villains) he never writes the actors in. I think it'll just somehow be about other time lords/previous villains then his previous regens this anniversary episode. 

So Moffat is going to pull something out of his ass rather than degenerate or invite the older who's back (at least in image)",0,1363028904,null,0,false,0,c8tr4cy,t3_19uzfv,t1_c8tr4cy,t3_19uzfv,null,1431552645,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,WDC312,lfc68,,"Idk about the Jose fuckup, honestly I'm okay with him following Mousa to the corner for two reasons:

* It's an excellent place to double team a player.  Double teams are effective when you can pin somebody against the line, or, better yet, in a corner.  I'd say a good 70% of the time, the ball ends up out for a corner or a throw when there are two guys on Mousa in that position, or Mousa loses possession.  (I pulled that number out of my ass.)
* If Mousa beats Lucas (that's Lucas following him, right?) he's got shit-tons of space along the end line.  Jose rushing to cover makes it less likely that Mousa will break out, and more likely that he'll have someone on his ass if he does.

Okay, I guess Gerrard did well to drop back and get in a position where he could track Mousa if he does break out, so maybe my second point is full of shit.

But as soon as Jose drops to follow Mousa, either Gerrard has to step to Bale, or Coutinho has to drop and close down Bale's space.  Gerrard stepping is a problem because it leaves a billion light years of space at the top corner of the box, but Coutinho or Suarez (?) should be able to drop back and cover.  Coutinho's a little far away, but he should be able to get back and at least make sure Bale can't take the slow, calm touch to line up the cross that he does.

My amateur analysis.  Feel free to explain exactly why I'm an idiot...

Edit: Also, not a positional thing, but Glen needs to fucking challenge players for the ball when he's defending crosses in the middle.

&gt;The CBI says £2.2bn should be moved from current spending to ""high-growth areas"". Some of this money should be used to build 50,000 new affordable homes, which it says would create 75,000 jobs.

&gt;The group also wants more investment in roads and infrastructure and a cap on business rates.

Cap on Business rates would be welcome, indeed my town centre is turning into a ghost town, the council are crazily hiking BR driving the last of the shops out of town... Crazy...

As for investment in Infrastructure and roads, Yes we need this, but not if it means privatising it, we do not pay our taxes to allow someone to run a our roads for a hefty profit, while charging us more to use the very roads we just paid to be built... Also HS2 is a fucking white elephant, give it up and invest in the Atlantic Gateway project instead.

Our owner, Delia Smith, is a well-loved and popular, if dated, TV Chef/cook from the 80s. She, along with her husband and others, bought the club in the 90s from Robert Chase, a hideous man who used the team as his personal bank account, selling on every player that showed even the slightest bit of talent, almost always against the managers wishes. Whist her ownership is the subject of many comedians efforts (best fed team in the league, prawn sandwiches, munchies city etc.) Delia has actually been remarkably popular, and the fans even forgave her for the infamous ""Where are you??"" (allegedly) drunken half-time outburst at Man City back in 2005ish. The Stephen Fry thing is quite a recent (public) phenomenon and has really helped our profile, as has Jake Humphry - a motor-sports and general sports caster over here, and Hugh Jackman (yes, Wolverine,) is another famous Norwich fan that gets overlooked. Due these guys and our unique colours, we are a team that stands out. Now, finally, we have a chance to get noticed for our actual football.

We also have one of the most popular away venues of any premiership side as, unlike most teams with a ground miles out of town, we have a large entertainment complex minutes from Carrow Road and, statistically speaking, one of the most consistent attendances of any of the mid-level premier ship teams do we have never lacked in atmosphere at home.

Our only real trophy to date was the 86(?) Milk (League) cup which was  1-0 victory over Sunderland (who scored an own-goal), and all subsequent fixtures against Sunderland are referred to as a 'friendship trophy' and the two clubs have had a tight bond since. Our other claims to fame are whooping Bayern Munich years ago, Man United this season (PILKOOOOOO!!) and trashing Ipswich twice the year we got promoted to the Premiership (and damn did it feel good!!). It's also fun to watch Aston Villa get relegated this season because of that traitor Lambert.

Steve Bruce, Andy Townsend and Mike Phelan (Man Utd assistant manager) are amongst our most famous alumni, (so is Robert Green unfortunately) but there have been others, and ignoring the unfortunate issue of our 7-1 defeat at Colchester whilst he was in charge, the club still has a great deal of fondness for our old 'keeper, Bryan Gunn as well as Robert Fleck, two of our heroes from the 80s.

https://www.gov.uk/your-employment-contract-how-it-can-be-changed/getting-agreement

&gt;If employers want to make changes to an employee’s contract, they must get their agreement. They should:

&gt;* consult or negotiate with employees or their representatives (eg from a trade union or staff association)
&gt;* explain the reasons for any changes
listen to alternative ideas from their employees
Employers might also want to talk with workers, asking them about their future plans. With older employees this can include talking about their thoughts on retirement and their options for staying in the job, eg changes to their role, hours or working pattern.

&gt;* If employees want to make changes to their contracts, they should explain the reasons. They can’t insist on making a change unless it’s covered by a statutory right, eg not working on a Sunday.

&gt;* Once any changes are agreed, the employer needs to confirm them in writing to their employees.

&gt;Once employers have agreed on changes with their staff, they need to:

&gt;* update the terms of their employees’ ‘written statement’ of employment conditions

&gt;* write to their employees within a month to tell them exactly what has changed

&gt;If an employer changes terms and conditions that aren’t in the written statement (eg the right to sick leave), they should tell their employees where to find information about the change.

One thing that should definitely be remembered is that Norwich although based in the city of Norwich, are essentially a county club representing the whole of Norfolk. Whereas in some other parts of the country where cities and towns are so close to other so local derbies are rife and borders small, Norfolk is a large (admittedly not by American standards), agricultural county with only one city, Norwich. By extension we only have that one big club so generally the majority of the county are behind them.

Norwich is a very beautiful city and things operate at a slower place there in Norfolk. The locals tend to like their lives laid back and consider the hustle and bustle of of the big cities exciting and also terrifying. Many will poke fun at the people of Norfolk for being backwards farmers but we know that we are far more cultured than those strange outsiders. 

We're also rather proud of our little team that has reached some big heights. Any Canary upon being asked of Norwich's achievements will in a flash tell you that we are the only British team to have beaten Bayern Munich at their fortress Olympiastadion and that record was sealed with their move to a new home in 2005.

It has for over 30 years offered independent, impartial and confidential advice between employees and employers. Its advice and service is free at point of use.

The ACAS website contains a wealth of documentation and I highly recommend taking a look. http://www.acas.org.uk

The ACAS helpline is available on 08457 47 47 47 and is available Monday through Friday, 8am through 8pm and Saturday, 9am through 1pm. The website http://www.saynoto0870.com lists an alternative telephone number of 0115 900 2670.

A direct link to an ACAS document about contractual amendments, adjustments and changes:
http://www.acas.org.uk/media/pdf/8/6/Varying-a-contract-of-employment-accessible-version.pdf

My view/opinion/conjecture is as follows. 

Your employer NEEDS to consult with you. This means they need to be open, and honest about the reason for the change. 

A contract is a binding agreement between two parties. 

An amendment without your consent MAY put the employer in breach of contract. Until very recently, it used to be the case that an amendment without both parties consent (employer and employee) would have constituted an immediate breach of contract. This unfortunately is no longer the default position.

If you point blank do not agree to the change and refuse to negotiate the  amendments, your employer could provide you with notice of termination of the contract. This would be your current, non-amended, notice period.

If the contract ends in this manner, there is the potential for you to open a (free, no cost to you) employment tribunal claim for constructive dismissal HOWEVER bear in mind recent case law:

In the recent case of Batemen &amp; Ors v Asda Stores Ltd (http://www.employmentcasesupdate.co.uk/site.aspx?i=ed4642), the Employment Tribunal held that employers MAY have the right to change the terms and conditions of a contract of employment. In this case, the claimants case, and subsequent appeal failed, as the tribunal found in favour of the employer Asda Stores Ltd.

Speaking specifically about existing parties, on paper I actually quite like the Lib Dems, but then in the real world they never do anything they promised on paper. I also like the libertarian attitude to state interference, and would like to see a lot less of that, for example I don't need the government to tell me what I should and shouldn't be smoking or eating or anything else, and I don't need the government to tell me who I can and can't marry, however I don't think UKIP are the people to deliver that agenda, I think they are just pretending to be libertarian to attract younger voters, for example they want to double the size of the navy, hardly a libertarian value. They are more like 70's politicians smoking cigars who long for the olden days. On a final note I like the socialist attitude of caring for people in need and I wish the Labour party would go back to being the party of the oppressed worker.

Someone made a comment during the game that I thought was pretty accurate: when JD isn't on form he somehow manages to not get drawn to the ball while simultaneously not making any useful runs. He doesn't drop off and facilitate movement around him, he doesn't work the channels very often, he doesn't play off the shoulder and get in behind. He just sort of stands there in the worst spot imaginable. 

If you watch Adebayor when we have the ball, he's always doing something useful. He ""posts up"" a lot on defenders and shows for the ball to feet, he works the channels constantly, he makes runs across the front of defenders and drags them around, he drops deep and pulls defenders to him, creating space for others to get in behind. 

Ade probably doesn't press the back 4 as well as JD but he gives so much more when we have the ball. 

I'm also not convinced he's a significantly worse finisher than Defoe. Neither of them can fucking score. ",0,1363035217,null,0,false,0,c8tssak,t3_1a2b40,t1_c8tssak,t1_c8tl9j4,null,1431553320,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Most, if not all, of the high profile whistleblowers who have been in the press recently  have motives other than the public interest in mind when making their complaints.  

Gary Walker, for example, took £500,000 to resolve the dispute he had with his employer.  He took independent legal advice at the time and decided to take the money and go.  Now, years later, he decides to revive the allegations he made because it suits him to portray himself as a wronged whistleblower.  I note that his principles don't require him to pay the money back....

AD (aggregate demand, which is the core of GDP) is comprised of C+I+G+(X-M) C = consumer spending, G = government spending. If you increase G by increasing the money spent on the military, and in turn increase C as soldiers are paid more, and there are more soldiers being paid, then AD will increase and the economy will pick up. This of course is a very microeconomic system in such a huge country, put it will no doubt help. And once the money from solider's incomes is being spent, in turn the multiplier effect will cause the money to in effect be ""recycled"" through the economy. The interest rate currently being at 0.5%, an investment from the government of £1million, the expected return on that would be about £20million increase in GDP (not per capita).

From Chris Huhne's [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Huhne) page:


Election conduct

During the leadership election, Nick Clegg registered a formal complaint about Huhne's conduct to Lord Rennard, the party's Chief Whip and returning officer.[53] Clegg stated that his rival was indulging in ""the politics of innuendo, mounting false challenges and running a campaign that is handing political ammunition to the party's political opponents"".[54] Huhne and Clegg were debating on live television on BBC's The Politics Show on Sunday 18 November 2007 when the presenter Jon Sopel produced a briefing document that had been specially delivered to the show's production team by the Huhne campaign team on the preceding Friday.[55] The document excoriated Clegg on a number of policy and political issues and was titled ""Calamity Clegg"".[56] When challenged about the document issued by his office, Huhne claimed that he had no knowledge of it and said he did not agree with the document title but agreed with the points within it.[57] When challenged how it was possible that he had no knowledge of such a major document sent to the producer of the show he was due to appear on, Huhne replied ""It's quite impossible to check everything that goes out of the office... But I can assure you that's not had my authorization.""[58] After Clegg complained about what he called ""dirty tricks"" and other senior party members condemned the Huhne campaign attack, Huhne's Campaign Manager Anna Werrin claimed that the title of the memo was just the product of an ""over-zealous researcher"" and had not been seen or approved by Huhne or any senior campaign officials prior to release. ""The document title had not been approved before the document was sent out and neither Chris nor I were aware of it.""[59]
Speaking to the Independent on 21 November 2007 Huhne claimed ""Unfortunately it was a mixture of responsibilities. It was an over-zealous young researcher who was responsible for drawing up the document."" The researcher was not on his staff, he said, denying that, as a former journalist he might have been expected to read what was put out in his name before it was put out.[60] However, in June 2010, after Huhne's long-running affair with his full-time press agent Carina Trimingham was uncovered, The Guardian and the Daily Mail revealed that the ""Calamity Clegg"" dossier had actually been created and circulated by Trimingham[61][62] who at that time was 41 years old, ""one of Mr. Huhne's closest aides"" and his official, on-staff press manager for the leadership campaign – reporting directly to Huhne.[63][64].

UKIP are bad, but hyperbole is worse. Also in the small time I've liked politics I've noticed whoever is in power - doesn't do a lot of what they said, enjoys full entitlement of being in the main party and most importantly doesn't have a *HUGE* impact on previous legislation.

For example... The current government before they were in; people were saying the NHS would be finished, Murdoch would gain MORE power and that they'd have a hard fist with immigration and rights... The NHS thing has been happening so slowly that hopefully the conservatives don't have enough time to dismantle it. Murdoch has gradually been gaining more power no matter what party he backs (Which again adds to my point) and has had a rougher ride than usual with the current government PLUS stopping immigration on such huge levels would effect the rich the most (As they are the ones employing cheaper labour, along with lazy ass Brits, not all, not wanting to do shitty jobs)

The government spending doesn't increase without borrowing.

I'm firmly in belief that we should borrow more, but we can't throw out all considerations. Would you rather spend it on something which simply recycles some of that money with a tiny bit of interest... or something actually which generates money and attracts wealth to the country.

3 new aircraft carriers would be expected to cost £18b (based on the cost on the projected cost of the HMS Queen Elizabeth), plus costs maintaining them. Then of course, we'll need those 55 F35s to land on them, which would run up to around £8.8b. That's £26b, a large chunk of which is going to the US. HS2 is expected to cost around £32b, but will apparently provide £43b in economic benefits as well as generate £27b in profits of it's own.

Now, before you start... I'm not saying HS2 is the best way to spend it, and those figures will most likely change. But dedicating the money to economic issues would be a better use than increased military spending.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I work for a mid sized university, and one of my responsibilities is looking after the online examinations setup. I'm on the technical side rather than the procedural aspect of how it's done. We currently have capacity for three hundred people submitting exams at a time, which more than suits what we're doing for both summative and formative testing, i.e exams, coursework and self-testing. 

We accredit degrees for a local college, and also for some institutions in China, Hong Kong, Dubai and Singapore and one of the main contacts with home base for those people is through the online testing. Primarily though our target market is local students from the town the university is in, and we have ties with the local FE college (once the largest in the country, not sure if it still is) so that there is a path for kids who didn't do well at school right through to PhD level should they prove able and want it. At one time this embarrassed me slightly, because I am old and it's not my vision of what a university and university life is, but I now think it's extraordinarily smart of the powers that be. This is a powerful market in the modern climate if the catchment area is large, and the town in question has the fastest growing young population in the country - and all from local births. Nobody really wants to move here which was probably one of the factors driving the decision.

I am constantly arguing for more money to be spent on our online capabilities though. It's an expensive and resource hungry business. I do not think it will be long before institutions such as Stanford, MIT and so on will be offering something very like degrees for people who do not attend, and are from all over the world, and will have such economies of scale that an institution like mine will be struggling in some areas. Stanford certainly have eyes pointed in this direction. We excel in the lab based sciences, Pharmacy in particular, so there is mileage for us yet. But computing, maths, and other technical subjects of their type can be done anywhere. 

Do you want a computing degree from say Southampton, or De Montford, or Leeds Met? Or do you want one at a cheaper price from a university at the heart of Silicon Valley?

I think it will take longer for the lesser of the Russell Group uni's, i.e Leeds, Newcastle, etc to struggle, and longer still if at all for the Durhams and Oxbridges, but it will come to some extent.

Europeans have been mixing it up for centuries, and always will. The real difference it has made has been opening up borders to former eastern block nations. I see pros and cons in this development, but this is a slightly different conversation for a different day.

If I wanted to go and live in Asia, I would hire a lawyer to sort it out... Same deal. My wife is not an EU citizen, but her country has a treaty with the EU so she can stay for 3 months with no visa, and within that time we found a lawyer and paid them a small amount of money to do everything and now she has a 5 year residency card, she has defacto the same rights as an EU citizen for 5 years. It cost about 200 quid and about 4 hours of time.... i think that we are really scraping the bottom of the barrel if 200 squid and 4 hours of spare time is the net benefit that we can highlight for staying in.

moving on to accountability. 

the type of accountability and reform that self generates when people sense that the gravy train is about to get derailed.

Britain has long been a largely transient member of the union, but now the rise of ukip has forced the tories into muttering the r word.... and all of a sudden Germany has remembered the good work that Britain has done for free trade etc and all of a sudden Germany notices that Britain is now its largest trading partner, because suddenly there is the realisation that if Britain leaves, Germany is chained to an economically imploding ~~corpse~~ economy larger than the US.

if nobody ever is THAT prick, and by THAT prick, I mean Farage... (because he is a prick) being willing to stick his neck out and rightfully mug people off, then nobody will ever feel the need to be willingly held accountable.

Believe it or not I'm not against the EU in theory, but these guys in charge are something else: no willingness to accept that they fucked up the economics and that they undermined sovereign democracy when pushing through all the treaties....

But honestly, I'm a little disillusioned with the whole party politics thing -- I think there's a bit of a disconnect between democracy and the political-party-paradigm. Let me explain:

We vote for our MP as our regional representatives, who then sit in parliament, represent us, and make laws on our behalf; the largest body of like-minded representatives (see: party) form a government and act almost always in concert.

The problem is, it's all about the union: it's all about the party and not about the representation. Without political parties there would be no such thing as a 'career politician,' and there'd be much less voter apathy, as representatives would rapidly get much better at listening to their constituents. Why would they do that, you ask? For the simple reason that when you go to the polls, you don't vote for your MP, you vote for your party. The candidate is an empty suit as far as you're concerned: you're voting for your party and your party's policies, you're voting for the leader of the political party you like the most: you're not voting for the candidate best equipped or most willing to fight your corner on the national stage.

true,Irctoaun,eng-Cambridgeshire,Cambridge,"I never thought UKIP had any policies other than *""Seriously reduce immigration""* and *""leave the EU""*, But now after I'm geniunely scared about what might happen if they got any power. 

First things first they want to basically make 1,000,000 people out of work immediatly with their spending cuts. Then there's their defence budget. Why oh why do we need an extra £4bn for the military. Admitedly I don't think the armed forces should be weakend to the level that they might be in the very bear future but £4bn?
Then you have to look at what they want to spend that £4bn on. for example the 50 jet aircraft would cost between £3.6bn and £8bn ([according to Wikipedia)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_F-35_Lightning_II), and don't forget the main, and at the moment only (touch wood) enemies are terror groups who's most sophisticated equipment is a rocket launcher.
And I don't even want to think about why we might need more nuclear weapons.
  
What about healthcare, as far as I can work out they want to privatise the NHS in a similar way to what has already been done at Stafford which has been in the news a lot recently for having an unacceptably high number of deaths or something else bad.

Then there's the environment policies which appear to have been written by someone on acid. Admittedly, wind farms are hideously inefficient and in this day and age nuclear is probably the most balanced (which is ironic given it relies on unstable atoms) and therefore best way of making power. So why do they want support coal fired power stations, if I'm not mistaken, burning coal is terrible for the environment and very expensive.

Finally UKIP's most well known, and arguably most bigoted ideology. Their Immigration and Culture policies. Do they not realise that the UK was *built* on multiculturalism so to ""end active promotion of the doctrine of multiculturalism"" seems like complete madness. (To highlight this I did a little research on the backgrounds of some of UKIP's members in which I found out Farage is probably an Italian or Hungarian name ([Link)](http://surnames.behindthename.com/names/search.php?terms=farage&amp;nmd=n&amp;operator=or) and their deputy leader spent time living in Spain [link] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Nuttall). But I digress)

So to try and cut immigration and multiculturalism seems like madness.

I know not all of UKIP's policies are bad, in fact I think the bigger parties might do well to adopt some of them, but like I said up there somewhere, I think it's really quite scary they could get some power.

Note: I know that one or two seat in the next election wont bring in any of their policies by the way.

true,socratees,null,null,"I think a number of factors would make an ideal party.

Firstly they should be technocratic, as in people in each policy brief are experts in that particular field. Economists would run the economy, engineers would be in charge of infrastructure projects, Clarkson in charge of transport (sic). This would be beneficial to everyone and stop unspecialised ministers being moved to departments where they have no knowledge.

This new party should be socially liberal. As in they would allow people to do as they want with their life, as long as it doesn't harm others. This would mean the legalisation and taxation of all drugs, give equality to all people, unrestricted science research and large funding into such research. Religions would be removed from the political system and lose their tax exempt status. Universities would be forced to take in pupils from state school in line with the how many people go to state and private schools respectively, this would help make society more meritocratic. Prisons would focus on the rehabilitation of criminals instead of this proxy 'tough stance' on crime. Anyone who is qualified from overseas would be allowed to come and work here.

As for economic affairs, I don't think the current approach is too far wrong. There should be reviews into all areas of spending and nothing should be exempt from cuts. This party would invest in manufacturing to move our economy away from the current model which is driven by the financial services sector, this would put money into the pockets of ordinary people and stabilise the economy. This party would also support the nationalisation of certain sectors such as Trains and Buses, Energy companies. This would provide better quality services at cheaper rates. Companies that fail to pay corporate tax even if it is through legal methods would be made to pay up or their business would be blocked.

The future of our planet would be taken seriously. Significant measures would go into finding ways to make our country self reliant for energy needs. Nuclear power seems to be the best option we have at the moment, like the French we should embrace it and decrease our reliance on oil from overseas.

true,[deleted],null,null,"In the U.S, there are two main tranches of sporting enthusiasm, the educational tranche, and the professional league tranche [think NFL, NBA, NHL etc], so much so that the professional leagues go straight to Universities to get their players. The Universities often offer scholarships to good High School players because, well, I don't know why, but they do, which means if you're fucking amazing at a sport there's a good chance a University will pay for you to come and play it for their team, where you have a chance of progressing to a professional league. This means that when parents go to high school games, they have an emotional investment in that game. Their kid might get to be a superstar if he plays well. The whole process is meshed together with an Educational standpoint. 




In the UK, this isn't the case. To get scouted you join local team clubs. Then from team clubs, a football academy might sign you on, where you might eventually play for the parent team. They don't really scout from University teams because if you're at university you probably paid enough attention in school to get there, which means you didn't play football enough to be superstar good. Another reason for this is because Universities don't hand out places for being good at a sport. They want academic achievement. If you don't have some kind of academic achievement, there's not a lot of ways for you to get into a university, because it's simply not worth the financial risk they take with you dropping out. They don't get anything from you being incredibly good at football. They don't get to say ""we supplied 18 football players to the premiership this year"". AS A RESULT OF THIS, people ARE emotionally invested in town clubs, because their kid or 'local boy' might get sent off to play for Arsenal one day. 



The urbanisation of the UK means that there are so god damn many towns and villages, and probably every single one has a football club to their name. You're probably never more than 10 miles away from a football club at any given time. In the US, it's a lot less densely populated, so lots of them don't have a team they can just pop down to see on a Sunday. What they do have are high school teams, because everyone needs a school, which is where the root of their passion lies. 




Or this might all be complete bullshit, which I suspect it is. I guess it's just because of culture. They have high school teams, we have town/village teams. -shrugs-",0,1363046696,null,0,1363048323,0,c8twnct,t3_1a4376,t1_c8twnct,t3_1a4376,null,1431555344,39,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,39

I'm not sure why LFC supporter groups can't ever make up their minds. People complain about lack of transfer expenditure and investment, the lack of progress on a new stadium and how our matchday revenue is lower than United, Arsenal, etc. 

The Anfield expansion will raise some money, but the main thing keeping matchday revenue down is that the ticket prices have been locked in at such a low level when the harsh reality is that people will pay more rather than lose their season ticket. That's the major factor crippling our ability to increase matchday revenue. 

Can we please all realize that if we want to be a ""big"" club, then we have to make more money to buy more (and better) players, which means we have to pay their absurd wages. FSG is not an oil sheikh or a Russian oligarch -- they have to be responsible for their decisions and expenditures. They're invested plenty of money in the club in the form of interest free loans and they need the help of the supporters. Will people at the upper tiers of the pricing pay more? Yes. Will most people be paying more compared to this season and previous seasons? Yes.

true,naryn,null,null,"Professional leagues are the reason the UK has a much lesser need for university or secondary (high school) sports.

The massive population density of England especially, makes it so that you're never far away from a professional team. If we're comparing like for like, let's look at some U.S. States' professional teams. Illinois is fairly close in size, 150,000 square km, to England's 135,000. In comparison, Illinois has a grand total of 6 sports teams. Okay, the population is lower, but even if we make it even (Illinois has 12.5 million, England has 53, so multiplying 6 x 4.5) Illinois had it a population of England would only have 27 sports teams. And this is over a total of 5 different sports (Hockey / Am Football / Football / Baseball and Basketball). 

In comparison, England's Premier League (Soccer) has 20 teams in it, League One with another 24 in it. That's a single sport, and it has 44 fairly competent teams in it. the NFL has just 16.

The other main thing is that our athletes don't go to university to play professionally. If you want to go professional then you go play for your local or county club, not your school or university. That means that the play is usually not as good, as you're not expecting semi-pro athletes at University games as you are in America.

The second is that almost all professional athletes in the USA go through university. When a professional team drafts a young player, they're usually straight out of university. So, when you're watching university sport in the USA, you're watching tomorrow's potential superstars. Very high caliber players at the very least. In the UK, professional teams pick up players around the age of 10, play them in the reserves from around 16 and they should be starting in the first team at 18. By the time an individual is playing for their university team in the UK, they've already failed to make it professionally. They may be good athletes, but they'll never make it big.

true,ViridianPanther,null,null,"***Stand on the right.*** You'll find out why soon enough. :)

Other suggestions:

1. [Get an Oyster card.](http://visitorshop.tfl.gov.uk) You can use them to travel virtually anywhere in London by bus, tube or overground train (not beyond, though, so be careful!) and it'll save you time and money. You can order one online (although there's no guarantee it'll arrive on time) or pick one up at almost any station in London.
2. Visit the museums. There are museums and art galleries galore in London, and loads of them are free. The Science Museum, V&amp;A, British Museum, Imperial War Museum, the National Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery are all great.
3. Walk or take the bus as much as possible. The Tube loses its novelty after a while and you won't see much of London from underground! (Bus hints: check the timetable and the map at the bus stop, and the number on the flags; when you see the bus coming, raise your arm as if you were hailing a taxi so the bus driver knows you want to get on. When it's time to get off, press the 'stop' button once only.)
4. Take a ride on bus numbers 9 and 15. The 9 runs from Aldwych to Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly, Hyde Park Corner, the Royal Albert Hall and Kensington High Street (and then on to Hammersmith); the 15 runs from Regent Street to Trafalgar Square, Aldwych, St. Paul's Cathedral, London Bridge and Tower Hill (for Tower Bridge) then onwards to Blackwall. Some buses in central London on these routes are the classic 'Routemaster' buses, and the fare's exactly the same as on a regular red bus: you can even use your Oyster card! Don't bother with a tour bus—they're overpriced, unnecessarily circuitous, and it's more fun to see London without a pre-recorded tour guide blaring in your ear.
5. Visit Brick Lane and Shoreditch (Aldgate East or Shoreditch High Street stations.) It's London's hipster central, but there's also great curries, great [fish and chips](http://poppiesfishandchips.co.uk), [fantastic coffee](http://www.nudeespresso.com) and markets and shops galore, if that's your thing.
6. It's also a short journey by bus or tube from Shoreditch to Mile End, where you can walk or bike along the Regents Canal towpath north to Hackney, or south to Limehouse and Canary Wharf. This is a nice walk on any day, but it's great on a sunny day, especially near sunset or sunrise—you get some glorious views of Canary Wharf and over the river and the canal!
7. Buy a bacon sandwich from the [Polo Bar](http://www.polo24hourbar.co.uk) opposite Liverpool Street station (on Bishopsgate.) It's £2.16 to go, or £2.40 to eat in. Once you've gone British bacon, you can't go back.
8. Rules for finding a pub/restaurant: look for somewhere you can see locals tucking in. Menus that have clearly been professionally designed are a red flag; multi-lingual menus, *fucking run.*
9. Hyde Park. Any trip to London is wasted without it.
10. Be smart when it comes to transport. For instance, loads of tourists go to Covent Garden station and end up with a long wait for the lifts—it's much quicker to go to Embankment or Charing Cross, and then get the bus or even just walk to Covent Garden from there. (As an aside, don't try to use the staircase on the way out of the station at Russell Square or Covent Garden: it's fine on the way down, but on the way up it's like climbing a very tall building! Save your breath and wait for the lifts.)
11. Londoners would have you believe that the transport network is shit, but in reality it's so comprehensive that if one section goes down, it's easy to re-route using the bus or an alternative Tube line. Don't be afraid to ask: most Londoners will be happy to give you directions.",0,1363051133,null,0,false,0,c8ty38q,t3_1a20j1,t1_c8ty38q,t3_1a20j1,null,1431556064,7,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,7

true,ksturgis,null,null,"&gt;Sometimes it doesn't help when the fans are not happy

That language is pretty telling. Clearly when the fans aren't happy (regardless of what they're unhappy about) it can have a negative effect of the players. 

&gt;If the simple presence of boos would put players off then home fans booing opposition players would put off the home team as well

This is different because you know your fans are booing the opposition. Rafa is not the opposition, he is the players' manager. When Chelsea fans boo Rafa, they're booing one of their own (whether they like to admit it or not). By extension, they are in fact booing Chelsea. 

&gt; ""We need them now more than ever""

THIS is perhaps the most important statement. The team clearly can feed off of support. They cannot feed off of boo's (even if said boo's are not directed toward the players). At this juncture, I just wish fans could swallow the vitriol and support the club through out the match. Table the boo's for another time and try to maintain a more positive, supporting atmosphere.

It's actually quite good tbh. (Some parts may be a little immature for some, but it has a strong plot and plenty of twists, and it is also fairly dark - themes of euthanasia especially)

I really think there are a lot of mature/good anime that push genres that aren't that invested in atm. Sci-fi, particularly. People should at least give some of them a go.

Darker than black, ghost in the shell stand alone complex(The films are good too, but the series is more plot driven), ergo proxy and Eden of the East, to name a few quite mature sci-fi anime. Then for example Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a very well polished fantasy anime, that is also fairly dark and has a fairly interesting plot.

Any Miyazaki film will be good: Princess Mononoke, Howls Moving Castle, Nausica valley of the wind, Laputa castle in the sky, Spirited away and My neighbour Totoro, Grave of the Fireflies.

true,ravniel,num11,,"Missing one sitter doesn't mean he's ""not scoring goals"" in general - he still has two goals in four games, one of which he didn't start, which is hardly dreadful for a midfielder.  I don't see any reason not to think he'll be a good goalscorer for us on the whole.

More importantly, this is what I don't understand:

&gt; He seems like a very technically good player but if he's not scoring goals I don't see what he does better than anyone else.

That seems contradictory to me.  He's a very good technical player, which Dempsey isn't (and that's the relevant comparison here).  Dempsey is okay.  Gylfi's passing and chance creation are *much* better than Dempsey's.  His through balls are excellent, his set-piece deliveries are excellent, he crosses well, he's just a much better all-around midfielder than Dempsey is.

Dempsey works hard to win the ball and he's good at getting himself into scoring positions.  That's about it, really.  Those are his strengths.  If you want an actual no. 10, or even just an attacking mid to move the ball more fluidly and with more creativity, I'd say you should pick Gylfi every time.

I like Dempsey, but I don't know why he's started as much of the season as he has.  Gylfi should have been playing more before now.",0,1363056035,null,0,false,0,c8tzp84,t3_1a3k0g,t1_c8tzp84,t1_c8ty5v2,null,1431556847,9,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,9

true,Brodiaq,null,null,"I think Dempsey's passing and creativity is underrated. His passing can be suspect at times, but earlier in the season he came into decent form and was scoring goals and has had some assists, a few of which were pretty sharp through balls. He has good technical skills just in a limited capacity I think. He is very good at getting himself some space for a shot or a pass, and he is good at getting decent attempts towards goal out of very little. He isn't the type of player who will beat several players on a blistering run, but he makes due. 

That being said Siggy is a better and a more natural option at the number 10 role, and to be honest I don't remember Dempsey ever crossing the ball this season. Every time he has played out left, he plays more like he did at Fulham cutting into the box rather than staying out wide. Whether this is by AVB's design I have no idea. 

Like you said Dempsey works very hard, has good movement, and finds a way to be in the right place at the right time, but I think its selling him a little short to say ""That's about it"". 

Siggy is playing great right now, and deserves the spot, but I hope Dempsey can make Siggy keep working for it, and I'd think it'd be a good sign for the team as a whole if Siggy, Dempsey, and Holtby manage to wrestle the starting spot from each other over the course of their time with Tottenham.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"Let's be completely candid though, the Labour Party _never really was_ the party of the worker.  The high water mark of its history was probably the ""introduction"" of the welfare state after the war, but, firstly, this was really more properly the expansion of a rudimentary welfare state created by the Liberals prior to the First World War, and, secondly, there was a cross party consensus that it should be expanded.  We had large numbers of battle-hardened, sometimes armed, working people returning from Europe, who were unemployed, physically and mentally shattered in many ways, pissed off with the State, occupying and squatting in military bases, bombed out buildings and empty housing, itching for radical change.  Even the Tories were very keen that they get that at the time, Quinton Hogg's 1943 comment that “we must give them reform or they will give us revolution” summed up the mood of the political class.  So, the Labour Party implemented policies that they all wanted to see implemented from the cross party Beveridge Report.  Not only that, but what might have been an admirable attempt to make the bosses pay for the health and social care costs of their workers, which even the slavers and feudal lords had had to meet, or, at least, faced social expectations that they would do so and social pressure if they did not, actually shifted much of the burden for meeting these costs onto the workers themselves in the form of National Insurance.

All the above is largely stolen from SolFed's primer on The Labour Party, so I'll quote the final couple of paragraphs in full since they pretty much sum up my attitude to political parties:

 'From its very beginnings the political representation of the working class has never served the working class. It cannot. As even Lenin recognised, the state serves capitalism and cannot be made to serve the interests of the proletariat. This does not only apply to the Labour Party, but all political parties. Consider the German Green Party, who once in government sent riot police against protesters trying to stop nuclear waste being transported through their communities – precisely the kind of green activism they had once supported. In 2001 they supported the invasion of Afghanistan as part of a coalition government. In Ireland too, the Green Party went from vocal supporters of the ‘Shell to Sea’ movement against the Corrib gas project to actually implementing it. Green minister Eamon Ryan was put in charge of the project, the Greens having dropped their election promises in order to enter a coalition government. On that note, the Liberal Democrat’s rapid u-turn on tuition fees in 2010, from a promise to abolish them to trebling them once in government, provides a recent illustration of this dynamic (and one which fuelled the student protests and riots across the country). In 2011 in Lewisham, one self-described ‘socialist’, the Labour Councillor Mike Harris even defended his making “democratic socialist cuts” (which are apparently better than nasty ‘Tory cuts’).

We are reminded of the anarchist Mikhail Bakunin’s sardonic remark, that “when the people are being beaten with a stick, they are not much happier if it is called ‘the People's Stick’....” Party politics aims at capturing the state, but when you capture the state, the state also captures you.'",0,1363059953,null,0,1363060555,0,c8u0yn0,t3_1a3oqk,t1_c8u0yn0,t1_c8tsogj,null,1431557375,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

true,ultimate_boss,null,null,"I'm not sure which systems Cartwright was supposed to have studied - her Wikipedia article isn't specific.  However, the field of nonlinear dynamics (or ""chaos theory"" as the media refers to it) was founded by Poincare's 1881 publication ""On curves defined by differential equations"", following on from work he had done for his PhD thesis.  The early results in the field by the likes of Poincare, Bendixson, Liapunov and others were often applied to nonlinear (or ""chaotic"") problems in celestial mechanics.  

Mary Cartwright wasn't born until 1900.  She may have done some work in the field and given some well-received lectures, but it's a bit of a stretch for the BBC to claim that she was ""one of founders"" of a theory well established before she was born.

Funnily enough, I've been doing my nonlinear dynamics Master's homework tonight and Mary Cartwright's name does not appear anywhere in my textbook.  In fact, the major results of the subject - the Poincare-Bendixson theorem, the concept of Liapunov stability and so on - were established long before Cartwright became a professional mathematician.

**Edit**: It is possible that she contributed something important to the field that is being overlooked by the textbooks, but it is difficult to tell anything about this based on little more than an anecdote by Freeman Dyson.

It always has happened it never went away in Britain, the difference here is that UCL is or was one of the first universities to try and start tackling it, and then it happened on their grounds.

There was suppose to be 3 section 1 for males, 1 for females and 1 for couples (mixed) apparently however this was not made clear to people when they arrived, there where 2 separate entrances one for females and one for males, people where then directed to either male or female sections and unless they kicked up a fuss not informed or directed to the couples/mixed section where supposedly was a very small allocated section (I think I read one comment on the video claimed it was only 2 rows) also of note was the way segregation occurred, rather than split the auditorium 3 ways saying the platform the actual debaters where on was split horizontal, males at the front females at the back furthest away from the people actually having the debate.

From what I have gathered Krauss was simply informed that there was no segregation he confirmed this at the debate and was permited to state this to the audiance, upon which 3 males moved from the male section into the female section like 2 rows behind where they where originaly sitting they where then escorted off the premises. There is a mixed claim as to all this with all divides of this nature, some claiming the gents did nothing wrong the other claiming they moved purely to try and cause offence. Eventualy however the ladies where moved BACK a few rows in essence reapplying the segregation, whether the ladies where given a choice or not is unknown assuming they where and where not intimidated (which I believe they would have been under the circumstances of a security guard standing there having kicked the gents out and now telling you to move back) then segregation again was enforced also of note is if the gents where that close to the females to begin with then they where already sitting in the mixed area one does wander if they where there for ladies or to cause offense or there for the actual debate if there where females present that they where sitting in the female section because they where friends of I doubt that they would have ended up sitting alone in the female section as they did in the end anyway. There was 2 sets of security present it should be noted UCL security and security provided by the organizers I think the best solution would be int eh future for UCL to say they provide security at any function on their grounds that you may bring additional security if you desire but their security TRUMPS yours. That's not what happens though security it has been implied are told to accommodation the people renting the premises.

TL;DR it was segregated with you stating your gender when you booked a ticket, 3 sections, male, mixed then female. Krauss was told there was no segregation so he stated this to the audience, 3 males then moved into the female section resulting int hem being kicked out and a huge scandal occurring.",0,1363066037,null,0,false,0,c8u2olk,t3_1a3e22,t1_c8u2olk,t1_c8tsyie,null,1431558201,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Stormwatch36,cyberman,Cyberperson,"No, I don't think you need to see more. To me it looks like you're just not understanding the time travel aspect.

First is the Time War. This happens before the start of Series 1. The Cult of Skaro get sent to the void, where they drift aimlessly along with a Time Lord prison ship containing tons of Daleks. Their ship is discovered by Torchwood One in 2007, and then Army of Ghosts/Doomsday takes place. They perform an emergency Temporal Shift, which sends them back in time to the 1930's, where Evolution of the Daleks takes place and everyone but Caan gets killed.

This is where it looks like you get confused. Yes, the Cult of Skaro (minus Caan) get killed in 1930. However, the show is about time travel. They went to 2007 *before* they went to 1930. Imagine that everyone in the show has their own personal timeline that differs from the main one. For another example, Rose gets trapped in the parallel universe in 2007, but that does not mean she wasn't present in the normal universe 5,000,000,000 years later in 5.5/Apple/26 for The End of the World. Her own personal timeline puts a few events in 5.5/Apple/26 before 2007, just as some events happen in 2007 before 1930 for the Cult of Skaro.

It's true that the government subsidy favours under 19s, but as far as I'm aware, the subsidy is only open to companies that have never (or at least not recently) recruited an apprentice before. So companies with established apprenticeships schemes won't be getting the grants anyway, meaning you're the same price as everybody else. What you have in your favour is maturity. You've got life experience and a work history on your side, which would put you a head of a fresh-faced 16-year-old in my eyes.

If you're worried you can't find an apprenticeship scheme that suits you, or you don't think you'll be taken on, don't go to a company, go to a training provider such as your local college. They're the ones that do the classroom stuff when you're not on the shop floor and it's as much in their interest to find you a place as anybody's. Call a few, explain your situation and ask if they can help you find a placement.

I wish more polititians would just call a spade a spade and say what's actually going on instead of spending so much time with so much spin dressing it up. It actually decreases the ability of the general public to pick who they should vote for as no one knows who to believe. 

Also, the commons is a fucking school playground argumental farce. What should be a civilised discussion between supposedly educated individuals turns out more often than not to just fall into petty one uppmanship. When the PM (whoever it may be at the time) is asked a question about how he is handling something it shouldn't be an acceptable answer to just reply ""Well actually your lot handled it a lot worse back in 199x and we all know what happened then..blahblah"" or whatever, when a back bencher asks a question there should be no acceptance of ""[insert polietly worded insult here]"" in place of an actual answer, etc. It's all just bloody petty.

true,nixin06,null,null,"&gt;It still baffles me that a tiny fraction of the population can be so all-powerful as to not be kept in check (we elected them!)—they have no accountability what so ever.

In a certain sense, this is the status quo (it's certainly how things were 100 years ago).  However, there has been a drastic shift from the conditions of the 1950s through 1970s, when the trade unions, along with the labour and social democratic parties, defended a system of social reforms grounded in the nation-state.

Developments in technology have rendered this perspective obsolete.  Capital can now move freely from one state to the next, demanding a global ""race to the bottom"" for workers' conditions.  The Labour and Social Democratic parties responded by transforming themselves into parties of big business, while the trade unions have essentially become labour contracting firms.

The global financial crisis has brought this to the boil.  Financial markets demand that workers be made to pay for the crisis, and this is creating intolerable conditions.  Explosions of rage, small and large, are occurring all over the world.  There is no shortage of willingness to fight - but people remain chained to the old parties and trade unions.  A break from these forces, and any ""left-talking"" elements that try to boost them, is absolutely necessary.

But what then - is it going to be enough to go do ""something stupid"" in large numbers?  We know from 2011's riots that just pouring rage into the streets will result in massive police crackdowns.  Workers and youth need a perspective.

true,pieandkimche,null,null,"well, i am not sure that the ukip document has a section on students, my wife came to the uk as a postgrad student, and stayed on a post grad visa, she wasn't an immigrant in the chicken cottage/borat sense of the stereotype, which is what i think they are really getting at. there is a big difference between someone coming to the uk to study, paying astronomical fees and rents, and someone coming illegally, claiming assylum to get a passport and then using that passport to bring over family members who then claim benefits, as you know yourself from your previous work, the stats dont work out to support that stereotype anyway, so it would be a tough issue to drive through parliament without the support of the left opposition who would pounce on it immediately

on immigration, i differ with the traditional conservative view, i think it was an accidental masterstroke by labour, they wanted to destroy the tory vote but may have helped save our future pension crisis, provided the economy gets off its knees

anyway, reverting back to my point about ron paul, in an extremely centralised political system, sometimes you may need a radical in power to get moderate change. i cant ever see ukip getting majority power. there are too many left leaning voters to see that. even with a coalition with the tories it would be very difficult for them to push through such draconian laws.

second point

i think that when a country votes no to the lisbon treaty, they should have their vote respected, not repeated revotes until they vote the same way. europe is a good idea, and when a constituent nation says no, its for a good reason, and maybe these views should be listened too, not ignored.

i think that when a country signs up to the european union on a free trade basis, it should have the right to vote when the base fundamentals of that relationship are drastically changed. 

these are all issue from the past, but the fact that i, an uneffected citizen from a different generation still takes umbrage at the destruction of soverign democracy should be telling

also, folks in uk should know, europe is not very popular from within and you would be surprised at how UKIP-like the mentality is on the ground. also its a regular thing to see people climbing into bins and skips to find food and scrap metal, or 20 guys sleeping in an indoor atm, shits crumbling here, drastically.",0,1363082065,null,0,false,0,c8u58j4,t3_1a2qql,t1_c8u58j4,t1_c8u4z2q,null,1431559475,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

With their first goal I've drawn what I think they [should have done](http://imgur.com/g6w5L8R).

true,couchlol,null,null,"I think the main problem with this is that assists are really not a well defined concept in football. A lung busting run, coupled with an incisive pass counts for nothing when the person the ball ends up with lays it off for someone to tap in.

If people want to make assists a proper thing in football it needs to be more like ice hockey, with multiple players getting credited as assisting for the goal. It's also needs to be somewhat subjective. The last two passers might have been simple balls, when the real goal creators were the guy with a deep interception/tackle and/or that player that split the defence with a big pass. Someone needs to look at the goal and decide who were the players that made the goal.

As an example, when we made the CL with Crouch scoring against City, no one was credited with an assist. However Kaboul was the one who made it to the touchline and crossed it in creating the goal, but because their keeper (or maybe defender) got a touch before Crouchy put it in Kaboul wasn't given an assist.

There were also countless Modric balls out to the wings that were statistically meaningless because a goal was scored from the resulting cross. He still made the goal and should be credited accordingly.

Edit: Let me expand on this. 

It's not just the FM and dFM who go on these missions. If you look at the last China visit, they take a ream of people involved in local business, including InvestNI. The whole point is to forge new links and build import or investment opportunities. 

NI is a tiny province compared to a massive economic south American country like Brazil. We can't just ship Arlene Foster out for a few days with a bumper box of Tayto. We need strong representation. Also, the world still perceives NI as post-conflict. ie we are just out of conflict and we could go back very quickly. So sending Marty and Peter together really highlights the perceived unity of our country. This is the sort of thing we need more of. 

As much as you can dislike what happens at Stormont, Marty and Robbo are part of our success story. They are part of making the world confident that we are definitely post-conflict.

Self determination has a great deal more strength when the people living there weren't installed by one of the countries claiming the territory. Installed there with the expressed desire to control the territory.

I'm a really suspicious of at least the reporting, at worst the manner that the referendum was conducted.

Does anyone happen to have census results for the population of the Islands. How many Brits? How many Argentines? How many other nationalities? Etc...

It would make more sense to have a referendum open to citizens of the United Kingdom and Argentina, who are over the age of 18, and ask them something along the lines of:

&gt; Most of the Chagossians now live in Mauritius and the United Kingdom after being **deported from their homeland by the British government in the late 1960s and early 1970s**. This mass deportation was carried out so that Diego Garcia, the island where most Chagossians lived, could serve as the location for a military base shared between the UK and the United States. Today, there are no Chagossians that live on the island of Diego Garcia, as it is now the site of the military base Camp Justice.

So, if the people of the Falklands have the right to self determination, shouldn't this be extended to other people affected by similar instances? 

Personally, I don't think that the British should have the Falklands. Looking back at the islands history, The British took the island from the Spanish back in the day, so they were not even the first people to inhabit the island and The Falklands is just a reminder of the British colonial past. Which in itself is a horrendous past, which is for another time.

None the less, the people who live on the Island, are British and want to remain British and voted as they did. But that is a moot point in the whole debate and the powers to be will do as they will. 

But back to my original point, I don't think the British government can pull the ""Self determination"" card, until they extend that right to people who they have wronged that are in the same situation.

true,Vivalayeo,ni,Northern Ireland,"The entire population did not want William as king. Hence why jacobitism remained a major threat for a century after William ascending the throne. At this time the monarch of England was also the Monarch of Scotland and Ireland who had large swathes of people who did not accept his claim, leading to the Williamite Wars, one of the best remembered in Irish History and the basis of the Ulster Loyalist mythos. So lets recap

&gt;if the entire population wants someone to come over it isn't an invasion

Well we know that isn't true, since there was a lot of opposition and a whole war fought over the issue.

&gt;Most historians do not count it as one

Which historians are these? The whole 'Bloodless Revolution' argument has been largely discredited. British History, especially English history needs to be viewed within the context of the whole British Isles, what happens in one part affects the others dramatically. While there was little to no violence in England, the same can't be said for Ireland and Scotland.

&gt; he had a strong claim to the throne, in fact his invasion was even negotiated in Britain by many politicians.

True, but even so James was still the lawful King of England despite all that. After the restoration of the Monarchy people had given oaths of loyalty, by inviting another foreign king in, they were essentially traitors. I understand though, he became the lawful King so to speak, hence why it is seen favourably today, had he lost and James succeeded it would very much be seen today as an all out invasion. History is written by the victors after all.

&gt;Hardly an invasion force, the population wanted a protestant king,

All talk about oaths and loyalty aside, the reason a war broke out in opposition to William was due to the fact that not everyone wanted him there. Large portions of the population were Catholic, especially in Ireland and the Scottish Highlands.

It's not a right.

&gt;that saves the lives of vulnerable people

Sure, because there are no other options at all, ever.

&gt;to prevent people in completely secure positions 

You do not know this, but the fact that you make this assumption speaks volumes.

&gt;having to go through the inconvenience of evicting people

Sure, a burglar is in no way incovenient, it's having to call the police that's a real drag.

&gt;if they ever get round to exercising their absentee ownership

Right, because if you don't notice your car missing, I haven't stolen it. And again, you're still making assumptions in order to justify theft (and that's before we get to the issue of the owner having the right to do whatever they want with their property, without getting *your* leave to do so first).

&gt;is a good thing

Yes it is, especially considering the daft excuses employed in defending the practice of asserting that your opinion is more important that other people's property and allows you to ignore the law as you see fit (which is basically what you're doing). Travellers race trap-horses along roads, and when the police pull over or arrest them assume that trap-racing being older than the law is some sort of defence. I haven't seen anyone else over the age of twenty daft enough to use that logic under the assumption that it's legitimate....until today. 

&gt;indeed you compare the right that had existed with the right to torture bears it offends you so. 

Sure, I wasn't doing it to illustrate how dumb using 'it's ancient' as a defence or justification really is in any way at all.

&gt;now the homeless can freeze

Sure, there are piles of them in the street outside right now. After all, not a single one of them has anywhere to go now that they can't break into buildings based on flimsy excuses about the state of the property or status of the owner, right?

&gt;and property owners who don't even use their property

Once again, this isn't your call to make. Stop pretending that it is.

&gt;Trying to take the moral high ground in favour of this though? I find that abhorrent. 

Trying to justify theft and asserting you have any right to ignore the law because it suits your purposes based on guesstimates about the person that owns what you're stealing? I find that *laughable*. ",0,1363098302,null,0,false,0,c8u7ohy,t3_1a2ne6,t1_c8u7ohy,t1_c8u78r4,null,1431560648,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Yes, you should pay-off your debts before you look at anything else. Pay off your CDL now, and pay off your overdraft in June, just before it starts accruing interest. Maybe use some for a nice holiday or something else to treat yourself then I would put the rest into savings as an emergency fund. You should really ensure that you have 3-6 months of funds available in an easily accessible format for a rainy day. 

Generally, ISAs are the way forward, and over the next few weeks – before the end of the tax year – the banks will, hopefully, begin to compete for custom on ISAs by raising their interest rates.

In effect there have been no Hospital Matrons for about 45 years. 35 years (ish) before the introduction of market forces into the NHS. The 92 -&gt; 97 Con government). These It was these reforms that broke the power of the Consultants. 

Wards are run by Ward Sisters (or Charge Nurses to give it its more modern, and gender inclusive, title).  Nursing, in the post matron era, started its process of modernisation: Developing systematic care models and using research to develop patient care as opposed to rote learning and tradition. 

The reason, I think people call for the return of the iconic matron has less to do with hospital management and far more to do with the control of women. When matrons stalked the hospitals (and their remit was far larger than just the wards) they had near absolute power over their staff.

The mass genocide of entire peoples because it was believed by them to be their divine right to conquer South America, simply look at the Tierra Del Fuego and the Argentinian genocide of the native population there, on the basis of resources. There is no point in looking at history to point the finger because it doesn't get us anywhere, as it stands there is a population inhabiting an island whose ownership is being quarreled over. On one side you have the Argentinians who claim its theirs as a left over of the Spanish Empire but whose argument is absurd when they themselves are a product of genocide and colonialism.

One that most people didn't agree with (funnily enough) - it was law for a long time that you could shoot a Welshman in Chester after midnight, as long as it was with a crossbow; but in this case, the law had *already* been changed previously to reduce the amount of time it took to evict squatters.

&gt;Someone who has enough wealth to have property they can leave idle is not at any risk of immediate starvation or freezing on the streets.

That's reductionism for the sake of convenience. Is the owner sick? Are they visiting someone abroad? You don't *know*, you're only examining the situation far enough to suit your own needs. Doesn't work like that - and that's before we return to the issue of ownership not being flexible by your decree and the reasons for the property being empty making *no difference* to your opinion about what *should* happen to it in any way at all.

&gt;Our constitution is built upon our rights and laws.

FTFY

&gt;Sometimes there is a justification for novelty, there is none here.

It is indeed a novelty when someone fails to comprehend that the law is not designed to be treated like a chinese meal if parts of it are incovenient. Really, so far your justifications/ excuses have been of the dog-ate-my-homework level.

&gt;I've noticed a lot more homeless about lately actually. Haven't you?

Are we treating anecdotal observations as evidence, now? If we are, I haven't noticed a single frozen-to-death homeless person anywhere.

&gt;It was never my call to make

If you're a homeless person breaking into someone else's property, then you're absolutely correct.

&gt;for hundreds of years there were rights for squatters and it never had anything to do with me.

For hundreds of years there was no NHS - can I stop paying for it now, in that case? After all, in ancient law there was no VAT or income tax either...I didn't realise it was all so easy.

&gt;Not that I've ever squatted but the whole point is before the law changed there was nothing ""stealing"" about it. 

But the law was changed (twice) *because it is stealing* - you're redefining property ownership to suit your needs, which isn't how it works. I could try and steal bread from a local shop, and when caught insist that I was 'starving to death' (in the manner of the header of this page) - but when there are soup kitchens in Trafalgar Square down the road/ food banks at the Town Hall, that claim becomes a bit hollow. I could steal your car, but cries of 'but he wasn't using it! I was in a hurry!' will not stop me being arrested.

You're welcome to list the number of homeless deaths from cold and how they've risen since the law was changed, and that's a proper conversation - but insisting that your definition of theft is actually not theft, that your guesses at why a property is empty are somehow legitimised by your need, and that people are only allowed to own stuff if their use of it meets *your* criteria are all non-starters.

&gt; Forced labour camps, nice one. I can see that helping us all out. What exactly would they farm five days a week? Eventually that's just be forced watching the crops grow.

'Forced' is a very emotive word &amp; considering nobody unable to work would ever be forced to do manual labour, I really don't see the moral issue with it.

Did you know that one Prisoner will cost the taxpayer anything from £20k-£35kish per year? Surely they should be paying for their place, farming food for themselves or the state. While them harvesting/planting/maintaining crops on a farm will never pay their place properly; it'll help subsidize them a lot, cut how much we pay, help them learn a skill in itself &amp; gives them something to do. If you really think that people can't be out doing farm jobs all year round, then you're a moron.

&gt; What about non religous people preaching hate? What would you do with the atheist from a few months ago that stood infront of to Muslims and started ripping up a Quraan?

I couldn't care less, it's a book of fairy tales. An Atheist doesn't call for X religion to be exterminated, an Atheist doesn't call for women to be opressed, an Atheist doesn't call for gays to be hung, an Atheist doesn't do blah blah blah.

&gt; Ah yes, forced labour camps again, that'll help us all.

Yeah, it would, we might be able to cut the prisons budget which means we can either reallocate that money to pay off our debts, put more money into education or even put more money into the NHS! Woop woop!

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; No, it didn't - you have to have the concept of ownership before you can take something that isn't yours.

And you have had to take something before you can call it property. If a volcano erupted in the middle of the sea, whose is it? The queen (and her institutions) have automatic squatting rights.

&gt; I wasn't aware there was oil around Buckingham Palace.

I could well believe that that is not the beginning nor end to your myopia. The Crown owns all the sea bed of the region as well as fracking rights which are then sold. One has to be particularly uncaring to accept that it is a right for rich people to buy houses yet not actually step foot inside once deeds are exchanged, instead favouring absentee ownership for the sole purpose of flipping it a number of years later for a profit. 

I can give you a specific example. In recent years there are a number of rich property owners that are squatting in Manchester. Former factories stand underused and in some cases deliberately left open to the elements and wild life so they can skirt planning law for easy demolition. The main motivation is the waiting for other people to improve the area so their land/property value increases without them having to do anything.

At some point ownership became an inversion, and in too many cases it means a rich person squatting on a resource to deny its wider utility. This mechanic can be found every where:

* copyright,
* patents,
* land,

I can't stress this enough. Also, even if they keep you for more than just a week, that doesn't mean that it's a good apprenticeship.

I learnt very little in the grand scheme of things and was really just there to do all the shitty jobs that no one else wanted to do. I got absolutely no respect from any other members of staff and if anything went wrong they were quick to place the blame on me. 

However, my brother is currently an apprentice and he loves it. He's treated as part of the team and his opinion on things matters. 

My advice would be the same as in the above post.

We hit this area with a three pronged assault. India, China, Japan. All at once. I figure this will take them by surprise and will probably surrender in a couple of weeks. Sweep accross the rest of Asia, stopping breifly to reunify Korea and win the acclaim of the USA. Then we conquer the unified Korea.

This puts us in an excellent position to take Russia by the back door, and get the US arses twitching. Following the fall of Moscow, we hit the rest of Eurpope from both east and west. I assume this will be all done by around 2015.

1. A social democratic party (Labour and left-leaning Lib Dems). 

2. A classical liberal party. ('small c' conservatives and Orange Book Lib Dems)

3. A right-wing conservative party. (social and fiscal conservatives and UKIP)

However, that is irrelevant. What we really need is pragmatism. A bad government or political party is one that places ideology before pragmatic solutions i.e. how do you support business and commerce whilst satisfying the cog that is the workforce? It is why the current government is a bad government - it ignores all advice from economists,  important figures and falling living standards in order to outsource the state. It is also why early New Labour was good, and later on it was bad - Blair was pragmatist in the first half, and ideologically motivated later on, and why opinions on Thatcher's rule are mixed (Get a Guardian reader with a Daily Mail/Telegraph reader, bring up the subject of Thatcher and sit and watch with a box of popcorn). 

It is also why the Soviet economy boomed under Stalin, a pragmatist who killed millions to secure his power, as did China after the reforms of Deng Xiaoping with his 'socialist market economy', whose predecessor was mostly a fervent ideologist who killed millions in the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution and had to be restrained by such figures as Zhou Enlai. 

If the Labour Party could release a pragmatic programme for growth, rather than spouting doctrines about 'predistribution' and consequently being vague, there would be more support than now. It's also why I like Vince Cable - he's a pragmatist and therefore seems quite stable. 

All this talk of overthrowing bosses and 'grassroots democracy' on the left is ludicrous and merely a shovel to bury this country. Why? People do not have the time or the patience to be looking through government documents and making intelligent decisions, or the stamina required by government to carry out painful but necessary decisions. We are naturally impatient and emotional beings. It is also why politicians seem cold, and why public schoolboys are rather good as leaders - they are conditioned from a young age to 'play up and play the game'. After all, politics is a game.

For the past 10 years or more:

- Benefits have been way too high. People have been living off benefits with no incentive to work. An attempt to change this has been made at the worst possible time. 
- Millionaire bankers have wrecked the economy.
- Government doesn't have a fucking clue.
- At the same time young people were pushed into degrees, they were massively devalued. It's all well and good pushing for more apprenticeships but what about all the unemployed graduates?
- Jobs are incredibly hard to get.
- Obtaining your first house is impossible. Renting is the only option. 
- Population (through immigration and previous prosperity) is out of control. Immense pressure on public services such as health and police.
- The environment is being destroyed. No credible plan for mass renewable energy (unlike Germany who actually have their shit together). 

What sort of future are young people and their children staring down the barrel of? Certainly not a good one. All I ask is don't be so quick to judge young people. They / we will be the ones dealing with it when you've gone.

I'm not sure if this is a thing now in any English super markets, I haven't been back to Britain in a few years now, but anyway. When you enter the super market, you can scan your store points card onto this little machine, and it gives you a little barcode scanner. You scan in everything you pick up as you go about your shopping, and then you go to a separate set of self-checkouts, you put the barcode scanner into one of the holders on the side, pay, and go. They do random checks every now and again, I presume because this system makes it very easy to steal things. Or even to just forget - some things just don't want to scan, and some times I forget to mention it to the person monitoring these self checkouts, but it is a very fast system, and far far faster than the ordinary self checkouts because everything is already scanned when you get there.

You can, if you choose, just take this to any till though, you just hand the cashier the barcode scanner and it all pops up, so it's not like you even need to use self checkout part, but there is a specific part for people with the barcode scanners.

Yes of course it would, because it is an act of war upon an sovereign state, the Falklands in the eyes of international law are no different than mainland Britain. They are for all intents and purposes sovereign British territory. The problem you have with your Diego Garcia analogy is that it doesn't particularly compare well, while to some the forceable relocation of 1200 people to from Diego Garcia to other islands in the Archipelago as heinous they were/are being compensated for it. With the Falklands they were taken in war and were uninhabited and essentially useless lumps of rock, the British took the expense of populating them when no one else really cared about them. The Argentine claim originated as a nationalistic ""dead horse"" to whip up fervor domestically and now is only a concern because of resources.

Furthermore on your Diego Garcia point what happened to the Chagossians who were not indigenous to the island probably lays at the door of the Maldivian administration who sold the Archipelago to Britain.

The problem with your survey is that on the whole these are everyday events (people refusing representation or answering no comment for example) and the outcome varies case by case depending on the strength of other evidence not just what is said in interview . There is no ""usual"" outcome. For example a no comment interview relating to an assault could result in no further action if it is one word against another or a charge if supported by CCTV or witnesses.  I really suggest you do some further reading on the subject. If genuinely interested try visiting your local Station for advice.

Harder to get in on but due to your age and life experience you stand a chance. This is basically the same qualification but with a payed position in a school with a job at the end of it in most cases. It's also almost all classroom based which trust me you want to have.
