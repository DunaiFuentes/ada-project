If this young lad who has been associated with this story were to choose to represent England at age 23, doing so would mean he would be sacrificing the massive opportunities afforded to a gifted youngster in playing for his own nation on an international stage at a much younger age.

Rooney, for example, bypassed the England youth setup entirely and made himself an institution in the England setup before his 21st birthday. If a player such as Januzaj is willing to sacrifice the opportunity to have that experience with his birth nation, in favour of playing for England, that level of commitment earns him that shirt more than any other entitled pleb.

Okay, So GPA stands for Grade Point Average. Each grade is worth a number value on a 0-4 scale. As are worth 4 points, Bs are worth 3 points, Cs are worth 2 points, D's are worth 1 point and Fs are worth 0 points. Fraction grades (A-, B+, B-, C+ and so on.) are worth a fraction of a Grade point. For example, B+ is worth 3.3, B- is worth 2.7 and a C+ is worth 2.3. To determine GPA, one would take the average of those numbers. A 3.0 means that one received an average of a B in all their classes. My 2.9 GPA means that my average grade was just below a B, but just above a B-. 

An honours course at school is a course that is accelerated. It is a class that has a more rigorous curriculum. It is often comparable to an introductory university course. To show that one has learned enough from the course, they often take the AP exam for that subject. For most colleges in the US, a 3 out of a possible 5 is enough to be counted as a pass, and may be used in place of one college course, and credit will be awarded. In California, most of the University of California schools, like Berkeley and UCLA, only take 4s and 5s as adequate proof.
 


The SAT is a standardized test that lots of students have to take in their junior or senior year of high school. It stands for Scholastic Aptitude Test. They also have Subject Tests, that they use to show that you are sufficiently knowledgeable to take a college course in that subject. They aren't used to give college credit usually, but are usually used to make your application desirable especially for competitive programs. Most students take these, save for those in the midwest, where most students take the ACT, which is essentially the same save for the Subject Tests.

I would personally reccomend using a firm like HelpHire or the like, as they will ensure you have a loan car for the entire time yours is being fixed, whilst dealing with all the paperwork. If the person is arguing against being at fault, HelpHire or the like will still take on the case and provide you with a car should you have witnesses etc. They will take all responsibility for all the paperwork and hassle from then on, and you will just be able to drive around in your 61plate car that is equivilant to what you own.

A lot of these claims drag on for a long time, and as such, you may come to renew, and without your no claims bonus, your policy may be much higher. They will then try and claim all of this back from the third party who crashed into you. Hopefully they can do that.

Or, you can go with a third party company, Helphire, EuropaConsultants, ThorneyCroft, all of whom specialise in non fault motor claims. They will sort you out a hire car, get your car repaired, sort out any personal injury claim if you are making one, all with no fee, no loss of your no claims bonus, no hassle. I believe HelpHire and Europa charge liability insurance at the start for a low (£25ish) sum, which protects you in the event of the accident eventually being ruled your fault later down the line; get this. if you do not, you will be liable for huge hire charges if the accident is somehow judged to have been caused by you.

Other companies may only take on claims they believe are clear cut, and thus state up front that even if you are fond to be at fault, they will cover all costs, and thus you do not require liability insurance.

Basically, read the paperwork they send, and avoid your insurer at all costs unless you are making a claim for theft, vandalism, or dealing with any other accident that was your fault you admitted to.

SVT has the rights to broadcast most (if not all) shows that they produced themselves and aired before June 30 2005. After that contract terms changed, I think. 

Might be irrelevant to the BBC/Channel 4 debate, but it might give an idea of how contracts in broadcasting works.

The F-22 and B-2 were built as huge leaps of technology to avoid being detected by Soviet radars. They also use technology and materials that were not around before they were designed and have become hugely specialised aircraft useful only for limited purposes. The current crop of drones, on the other hand, are designed to fly high, gather intelligence and occasionally fire upon a perceived threat. All of which they do using mostly off the shelf parts, the majority of the work going into making it fly reliably.

Also, apart from a Navy, an Air Force is the most expensive thing a country can have. For instance, the MQ-9 Reaper has a unit cost of just over £10 million for the RAF. For that price you can get one of the below*

* Challenger II tank x2 (£4.2 million)
* Cougar H Infantry Mobility Vehicle x 33 (£298,000)
* Snatch Land Rover x 200 (£50,000)

Needless to say the Reaper is 'cheap' compared to other aircraft, however, as far as spending goes, it is still a huge expense, despite drone's having a few advantages over manned aircraft.

I was a newborn, my father a pit worker.  They had been called on strike and my dad wasn't going to scab.  For the first year of my life he worked any job he could.  He built a church roof, stone walls, any odd job going.  

He had just purchased his first house before he went on strike and so he couldn't afford the monthly re-payments.  He had to ask the bank to just pay the interest whilst he was on strike.  This meant my mother had to support all three of us.  She was a child minder.

I was 3 months old when winter came around.  We were so cold.  The gas boiler hadn't been on for months, (it was one of the old meters you had to put money in).  One day my dad came into my room and said I was ""blue in your crib"".  He went and ""fiddled"" with the gas meter and we had heat again.  (The only problem in he turned it back by a decimal place too high, so we were massive in credit!  We had to have the heating on for  weeks non stop with all the windows on just to make it look legit.)

The year went and we scraped by.  After he went back to work we knew it was only a matter of time before they made him redundant. 

When I was 5/6 I remember the school dinner ladies talking about me, then one would ask how my dad was getting on.  I never understood at the time but everyone knew what was happening.  You could feel the splits in society as whole families had been torn apart. It was never the same again.

Because it primarily funds the BBC (and C4 I belive) and not the other stations who have to rely on advertising to make ends meet. 

There is (I think) a fairly strong argument against the license for those who have no intrest in watching the BBC - say people who only wish to watch sky tv shows and already pay a subscription.

From their site...

&gt; Q: When do you need a licence? Do you need one for watching TV using an iPlayer?
&gt; 
&gt; A: You need a TV Licence to watch or record TV programmes as they are being shown on television, irrespective of what channel you're watching, what device you are using (TV, computer, laptop, mobile phone or any other), and how you receive them (terrestrial, satellite, cable, via the internet or any other way).
&gt; 
&gt; You do not need a TV Licence if you are watching TV after it has been shown on television, eg TV programmes downloaded or streamed after broadcast.

In year 1 we have roughly 50% below and 50% above average. In year 2 50% of the schools in the nation will have to have improved substantially, so that the low-end tail of the curve now starts at the mean point of year 1. 

But in doing so, the average will have shifted hugely upwards, so in Year 3 they have to improve by an even larger amount to be above the new heightened average.

A bit of sketching on the back of a napkin suggests to me that this could create an exponential curve with the lower performing schools having to improve by a larger leap each year to hit last year's average. By about year 3, the lowest performing schools will be be substantially better than the best performing schools in the schools today, with the lowliest failing comprehensive outperforming the top grammar schools.

I'm not saying drop Andros, but the better talent is Lamela and at some point you need to let a record signing get a run of games. He wasn't bought to sit on the bench; his price reflects his potential and he won't reach that or become acclimated with the league unless he plays in it. 

What I don't understand is why we can't give Andros a game or two on the left. Gylfi has been pretty decent in the Premier League, but playing two right-footed players on the left has been just generally awful while Rose has been injured. 

Townsend started his career on the left, he's very two-footed, and perhaps he'll give us width.

Maybe not completely, but I don't want any freedom taken away. What have I done to rouse the government's interest in my life that they want to store all my private conversations? I pay tax money so that these strangers can spy on me and the entire country in the off chance that they might just stop a few people from dying? Not worth it. People die every day, we can't save everyone. 

Tell me, do you think the government really cares about your life or health? If so then why is there a heroin epidemic in Scotland (and probably elsewhere) that is never discussed? Why are cigarettes being sold freely in shops across the country? Why do they allow this binge drinking culture to continue without doing anything to try and change it? Why do we have unhealthy fast food advertisements shoved down our throats every day? All of these things kill way more people than ""terrorism"" ever will.

Government spying on it's people has nothing to do with terrorism or saving lives, it is only about gaining more control through fear tactics.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I didn't mean to use the slippery slope argument to just discount what you were saying, just that to say information will be used erroneously against people and that politicians and activists will be targeted because of some NSA agents misusing the data before is a slippery slope, it's a possibility that may not ever happen and which in reality should not ever happen as long as checks are in place. 

&gt; I don't believe it is safe for the security services to have the capability it wants. They have already been caught lying and covering up their activity, so how can we trust them when they say there is sufficient oversight and regulation? Is there any follow-up when they fill out that form to make sure their snooping only covers that specific context? And who does that follow-up? An independent regulator, or court? In America they have a secret court meant to oversee the surveillance program, and even they have admitted they can only rely on what the NSA tells them. This makes them essentially useless.

There would definitely need to be more discussion into oversight and regulation, and one suggestion is to have known human rights and free speech advocates working on such regulation, in order to have people keeping the system in check who don't have an obvious bias in favour of the measures in the first place. 

These tools could be used for a police state, but while certain measures may be worrying we are nowhere near such a state, and could one really be established overnight? I agree that an open discussion does need to be had though, and that the right checks and balances need to be in place to prevent potential misuse of the system. 

&gt; Who tells us this monitoring is essential? The security services. Who has an enormous interest in having this kind of monitoring? The security services. If they had their way we wouldn't know they could conduct this monitoring at all. Surely this is the real enemy of democracy.

It's also very possible that there are many people working hard to try and hone the line between necessary surveillance and impeaching on civil liberties. There has always been secret surveillance and there always will be, it is required in order to combat violent and catastrophic threats to democracy. 

&gt; Why would they, knowing what they know now? MI5 would have us believe that simply knowing that they may be monitored will cause them to take such great care in their communications that they can no longer be stopped. Any terrorist group competent and co-ordinated enough to cause damage worth any real worry is not going to chat about their plans over Facebook.


There will still be methods internet savy criminals will employ to try and get around the surveillance measures, and it's not feasible for such criminals or terrorists to just not use the internet altogether. They aren't likely to be chatting on Facebook but there are plenty of of other methods that they may use to communicate online. 

The potential for mass surveillance and data collection at the margins of GCHQ's work is a definite cause for concern, and debate does need to be had on both sides, but I still don't think just dismissing it all and stating that if people die it's ok as long as civil liberties aren't impeached is the best way to go.",0,1381367192,null,0,1381415403,0,ccokunt,t3_1o0q9f,t1_ccokunt,t1_cco3tu7,null,1429184852,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

People die every day, we can't save everyone.

There are checks in place to prevent such data being misused; it will only be viewed if sufficient justification is provided. Obviously the validity of these checks needs to be questioned; with one suggestion being that known human rights and/or free speech advocates work to ensure these checks are correctly enforced, so that there are visible people without a bias in favour of the surveillance ensuring it is not abused. We can't save everyone, but there are measures we can take to prevent people from dying, and a fine line does need to be drawn between surveillance to save lives and surveillance that imposes too far on civil liberties. Some degree of freedom has to be leased in order for spies to operate. 


&gt; Tell me, do you think the government really cares about your life or health? If so then why is there a heroin epidemic in Scotland (and probably elsewhere) that is never discussed? Why are cigarettes being sold freely in shops across the country? Why do they allow this binge drinking culture to continue without doing anything to try and change it? Why do we have unhealthy fast food advertisements shoved down our throats every day? All of these things kill way more people than ""terrorism"" ever will.

Agreed that there are many things that do not receive enough attention by the government, and that that is a huge failing on their part. There are people though who are working to balance the line between surveillance to save lives and harmful impeaching of civil liberties. Several terrorist attempts have been foiled due to intelligence gathering in recent years, and not every foiled attempt is made public.

Doctor River Song would be a Ph.D. Doctor since her Doctorate is in archeology (much like Indiana Jones i.e. Dr. Jones has a Ph.D.). The Doctor's Doctorate is never really explained, or if he even really has one as we know Time Lords chose a ""nickname"" rather than telling people what their real name is. Assuming he has one it is probably academic (vast knowledge of obscure things even for a Time Lord) but various incarnations have shown medical knowledge too so he could be both. 

Personally I think he just chose it as an honorific and since Time Lords are smart compared to us apes we think he is both when he is neither by a Time Lord standard. 

There are theories floating around that since he was a healer/helper mostly prior to the reboot where they try to make him a dark destroyer that is why he chose the moniker ""The Doctor."" 

If you have been or are going to college most of the professors will be Ph.D.s. After you get your Ph.D. most of the researchers and a lot of the Professors do additional training called a ""Post-Doc"" which is short for Post Doctorate (which is what the D in Ph.D stands for).

However I see this turning into the vigilante style of thinking everyone who has a dodgy beard or whatever is a peadophile, which not only targets innocent people. But turns out to be utter shit in general in finding real peados.

These are two well known examples of just how well that practise worked in catching alleged murderers who were cleared but process is the same.

stephen fry is a rich man who went to a elite university and got on tv performing comedy for rich bankers and the elite. which was the same way monty python came into being by the way (cambridge footlights).

downton abbey is a celebration of a slave like existence of indentured (born into) slavery of the rich by the working class. It is a celebration of the rich upper classes and despisement of the poor all the way. it also happens to be written by a conservative lord. at the time of george osbourne and his cuts.

I expected it to be a few minutes off. Never did it cross my mind that they'd line up down to *the second*. Freaky.

Of course, the LC recons and the fact that some older episodes have little bits missing here and there (cuts due to foreign censorship that were never able to be restored, prints with damaged sections here and there) likely mean that if the original tapes still existed it may not be so precise.

I understand it of course, the government want all the rich people to stay so they can invest in the economy. Start taxing them too heavily and they'll take all their money to another country, because they can afford it.

But when a mother of two, who has lived in a house for decades, always on time with rent, who has raised two children that have gone on to become productive members of society, with jobs and who pay taxes, it feels a bit disingenuous when her rent is disproportionately increase by 20% to the point where she can no longer afford it.

I would be interested in sources anyone can provide where MPs *have* seen to be self-sacrificing, and/or any legislation that hasn't been directed solely at the poor, or a wider and more concise overview of the changes enacted by the government that have actually improved situations for others.

true,PlasticFeast,troughton,Troughton,"A list of reasons why I love Donna, because lists are easy.

1. She wasn't in love with The Doctor. I got so sick of all the other companions that fall head over heels for him. Granted, it's understandable that you'd fall in love when a mysterious and immensely attractive man who can take you anywhere in space and time, but it was overdone (especially with Tennant's Doctor) and because of this, Donna was a breath of fresh air.

2. Donna and The Doctor were great friends. Their chemistry was often hilarious (at least, to me) and I found that Tennant and Tate played brilliantly off each other's personalities.

3. She wasn't afraid to tell The Doctor he was wrong. The Doctor would sometimes feel that he by default was in the right or was more important than everyone else because he's the wise, mysterious and devilishly handsome genius from space that has lived 1000s of years. Donna would often be the one who argued that he wasn't perfect and brought him back down to Earth (or Gallifrey^or^Messaline^or^Midnight^or^some^other^planet )

4. Kinda goes with 3, but she showed more compassion than The Doctor at points. For example, a lot of the drama in *The Fires of Pompeii* came from the fact The Doctor just wants to leave everyone in Pompeii to be killed by the volcano while Donna wants to save them. Granted, The Doctor had a pretty good, albeit confusing, reason why he wouldn't save them, but the finale where [Medium-sized Spoiler](#s ""Donna convinces The Doctor to save Caecilius and his family"") shows that, not only was Donna more compassionate than The Doctor, but that The Doctor truly valued her opinion (goes with reason 2) and it's with her help The Doctor becomes a bit of a better person.

5. I honestly found her to be really, really funny. I know that's not as good a reason as the others, but it needs saying anyway.

In short, The Doctor is amazing, but he is nowhere near perfect. Donna knows this and helps make him into a better person. That's why I love Donna.

""(6) On an application under subsection (1), the court may make a sexual risk order if it is satisfied that the defendant has, whether before or after the commencement of this Part, done an act of a sexual nature as a result of which it is necessary to make such an order for the purpose of—

(a) protecting the public or any particular members of the public
from harm from the defendant, or

(b) protecting children or vulnerable adults generally, or any
particular children or vulnerable adults, from harm from the

“harm” from the defendant means physical or psychological harm caused
by the defendant doing an act of a sexual nature;

So, why don't you want help from the recruiter you applied with? In some situations, they won't be helping they will be CV skimming. What this means, is that they will be going through your CV for information that can help them. If they are doing this they will want to know info about team size / managers / reporting procedures. They may also ask for references or in fact names of your old managers so that they can remove their name from a list of hiring managers they know so that they can get your name out there without duplication. They will also want to know what other jobs you have applied for (if you feel this is what they are doing, tell them nothing).


Now, if they are really helping, it may be for a good reason. I have lost count of the times people have emailed me their CV for repeated jobs they are simply not qualified for, or at least their CV doesn't show that they are. In these cases, I will call the candidate in question, I will explain to them that repeatedly applying for a IT Management positions when you have no more than 2 years experience on a helpdesk can be in fact more damaging to your job search than you think. I remember names, I remember the people who send me 15 applications a day for a variety of jobs that they just aren't qualified to do.

So, I phone them, I give them some help with their CV, I give them realistic positions to be applying for and realistic salary expectations for the market they wish to work in.

There is also the fact that when we put an advert out, we know a lot more about the company and what they want than you will know or could research. We have been to their offices, we have met their staff we have a better insight. If we want to spend 15 minutes on the phone with you before sending your CV, it's in order to improve your application and give you a better chance of getting an interview / the position.


The problem is, there are recruiters out there who will do anything except being honest to succeed. What can I do?

It's fantastic that they've made all these advancements and offer great content but the fact remains that I shouldn't have to pay for the part of their service that has a fee attached to it if I want to access services that don't have a fee or are unrelated to the BBC at all. 

It would be like having to pay a fee to listen to ALL music services online but that fee exclusively funds iTunes and services like spotify would be locked off if you didn't pay it. That concept is archaic.

You state that Lamela is a better talent than Townsend - that may well be the case but I'm curious as to what you're basing that on. The fact that he's Argentine? The fact that we signed him from a big Serie A team? The fact that he cost so much money? None of those factors are important. We signed David Bentley for £15m and Aaron Lennon for £1m - and yet Lennon proved to be a much better signing for Spurs than Bentley.

Similarly, a lot of people seem to have decided that Chadli is an average squad player whereas Lamela is the future of Spurs, because one was signed from a smaller club and cost £7m whereas the other was signed from a bigger club and cost £25m.

First round is to people who have signed up to the Away ticket scheme - basically committing to buy every away ticket. There is an Away ticket scheme for both domestic and european fixtures.

Second round then goes to season ticket holders first, and may include a loyalty points threshold requirement depending on size of allocation/demand.

Third round is usually where memberships can purchase. Sometimes there may be a loyalty point requirement here also.

The issue is not that your public web content is readable, it is that your private content is also readable.

Some of that is due to a misunderstanding of technology (if you send mails in plaintext, there's nothing to stop a sysadmin at your ISP/email provider reading every word), but a large part of that is due to expectations.

If you make a mobile phone call in the US then [your conversation is recorded](http://www.euronews.com/2013/07/01/greenwald-nsa-can-obtain-one-billion-cell-phone-calls-a-day-store-them-and-lis/). If you use an https connection to talk to your bank then it is probably [not secure](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/09/the_nsa_is_brea.html). If you carry a mobile phone with you then your location is almost certainly being recorded.

The counter-argument, first put forward by Josef Goebbels, is that if you have nothing to hide then you have nothing to fear.

There are clearly limits as to what monitoring a state should be able to perform (Unseal your envelopes? Record your conversations with your doctor? Strip search you every time you boarded a bus/train/plane?), and for many people these limits have been breached.

This is compounded by the fact that this monitoring was implemented without any public discussion, allegedly not even at [Cabinet level](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/06/cabinet-gchq-surveillance-spying-huhne), and are easily circumventable by the people they're ostensibly aimed at.

""Trust us, we won't abuse the power we've unilaterally given ourselves"" is never a convincing argument. It becomes even less convincing when you understand that the people performing the monitoring are ordinary people too - [power corrupts](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10263880/NSA-employees-spied-on-their-lovers-using-eavesdropping-programme.html).

It's a horribly put together piece that deliberately conflates multiple issues. 

It starts off pointing out the grim reality of Libyan prisons, and a series of bombings in Iraq.  It then uses the horrible situation regarding the chemical weapons attacks in Syria  to attempt to show a media  conspiracy for military action in Syria. 

It slams the Guardian's leader for saying that 'there was not 'much doubt' who was to blame.  It conveniently ignores the fact that the  Guardian piece points out the weird timing of the attack (with inspectors in the country) and points out that the military options are all bad. MediaLens conveniently ignores those aspects because it doesn't match its preferred commentary. 


There's no mention on MediaLens of the videos all over Youtube which provided prima facie evidence that some kind of chemical attack had occurred. Instead it uses a quote from Robert Fisk on a *earlier* claim of chemical weapons uses, to try and demolish *this* claim. 

MediaLense claims: ""UK journalists appeared yet again to be succumbing to the influence of state propaganda demonising an Official Enemy, exactly as happened with Iraq and Libya""


In fact, most of the reporting came out before governments produced official reaction. I  contend that MediaLens is being just as lazy as any journalist that it is reporting on here. Journalists were picking up the evidence they could, looking at the videos, weighing the balance of probabilities (who has control of chemical weapons in the country, who has control of  the rockets needed to deliver them) and coming to conclusions.

MediaLens appears to start an editorial position: ""There is a media conspiracy to push for a war in Syria"" and then cherry-picks quotes and passages from the media to try and support that position.

It's really not very impressive.

Because the Royal Mail's main business is sending letters.

Well, with the advent of text-messaging and the Internet, letters are a dying marketplace, and have been for at *least* the last decade, hence why they've been losing money endlessly (with the exception of this most recent year, and only because they were relieved of the burden of their pension deficit).

Ironically, the advent of the Internet (and the arrival of Amazon, Ebay etc) means that sending parcels is a growing market place. Unfortunately, sending parcels is a small area of Royal Mail's business. Most of their focus is on sending letters.

So to survive, they need to massively reorganise their business to focus mainly on sending parcels, and scale back their letter business in order to return to consistent profit.

Such a massive reorganisation requires money. Lots of money. When any other large organisation faces this issue, they sometimes do what the Royal Mail is doing: Floating on the stock exchange in order to raise the funds to reorganise.",0,1381396877,null,0,false,0,ccos5ob,t3_1o3yfs,t1_ccos5ob,t1_ccor61f,null,1429181431,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt; Back at Easter 

Unfortunately 6 months isn't that long in terms of motor claims. A lot of the big insurers have claims departments that are massively over-stretched. I no longer work for an insurer but when I did I had a caseload of over 600 live claims and a post backlog of over 2 weeks. That was a small insurer, I shudder to think how some of the bigger insurers are coping. 

&gt; Boots van 

Us claims handlers HATE dealing with commercial insurance. Commerical insurers, especially those that deal with large fleets are HORRIFICALLY slow. Unless you or your passengers were injured, you can guarantee that your case is wallowing in the middle of an ""unimportant"" pile somewhere.   

The best way to counter this is to push your insurers to push the third party insurers. And keep harassing them. 

&gt; side swiped my car.....Boot's insurance company still hasn't admitted fault

As a claims handler I'd be concerned about the term ""side swiped."" What exactly do you mean by that? This could be the reason for the delay. What were the circumstances?

&gt; What can I do? Small Claims Court?

The best thing to do would be to contact your insurers and find out EXACTLY how they are getting on. It's unlikely they will recover your excess for you as it's an uninsured loss. If you've got legal expense cover on your policy, then they will appoint an uninsured loss recovery firm / solicitor to recover your excess from the third party insurer.  

Solicitors are notoriously slow too....so your best option may be to get Boot's insurers details of your insurer and contact them directly. Kick up a bit of a fuss and see what happens.

All I'm saying is that that simply isn't true. It may be true in certain circumstances. It may be particularly true in working for a very large company, which doesn’t particularly help OP in his current job for a lower-league football club.

Let's assume there are currently 1,000 active terrorists in the UK, out of 60,000,000 people.  And let's assume that we have a nice internet monitoring system that correctly identifies a terrorist 99.9% of the time (this is much, much higher than is in any way possible, since terrorists will by trying not to broadcast their intentions).  Let's also assume that 0.1% (way lower than likely I'd expect) of the time it incorrectly identifies a nice normal person as a terrorist.

Given the above numbers we will correctly identify 5994 terrorists, and will miss 6 of them.

It will also incorrectly identify 60,000 normal people as terrorists.  Giving a 10:1 ratio, and 66,000 possible suspects.  This isn't massively helpful.  A number of innocent people may also end up getting caught in the system, like john charles de menzes.

Not to mention that a system like this is inherently insecure (snowden proves this), and is potentially open to significant abuse.  We don't even know what they're doing to the data or how they're using it.

Look at their use of emotive language.  Scrounger is the one at the moment.  10 years ago it was immigration.  If you said that you didn't believe we should have unchecked migration then you were instantly a racist.  They label hate in a more insidious manner, they make it emotive for anyone to have views different to their own.  I remember a few years back they were lambasting a local councillor for his views on immigration.  His complaints were relating to the effect on the school system and the fact they can't magic up 200 places.  It isn't racist to say a shift of 2M people is going to create problems.  Yet the Guardian really tried to make anyone who said something like that, appear to be a signed up BNP member.

Look at that comment piece.  There is no way for saying that some benefits are too generous, the language forces a divide apparently, anyone who criticises benefit claimants, calls them scroungers.  Do you not see that is a terrible way of doing journalism?

If you are doing problem solving the first thing to do is define the problem space, often the best way to solve the problem is to shift the space.  This is exactly what almost every Guardian political piece does.  We can't say that pensions offered to certain state staff are far too expensive, they have to say attack on scroungers.  You never see the non-emotive term used.

If you don't think that doublespeak is horrifically poor.  Think of their use of the 'Bedroom Tax'.  Now if you are going to equate a reduction in benefits with a tax, then you've truly gone far beyond and deep in to propaganda.

The immigration thing was, as I said 10 years ago.  They are doing the exact same thing with anyone who criticises benefits. 

&gt;So you're saying that they didn't, then. But because they pointed out others are being horrible about it, that makes them just as bad?

You misunderstand me, they did write some nasty pieces, but they covered stories of other actions as a good excuse to write it.  It's akin to the whole [I'm just asking questions](http://www.southparkstudios.com/clips/255334/ask-y).

&gt;Are you seriously comparing hurting the feelings of bankers (who are still alive and richer than ever) with the persecution of a trans primary school teacher (who is now dead by suicide)? 

So for a start off, the lady committed suicide, she was not stable and didn't take well to the pressure, it was inappropriate but it was one or two articles.  You can't take the person's reaction into the equation without then analysing their mental state.  Adding the whole **bold text to really** is only striking an emotive point.

It's really interesting that you say they are still alive and richer than ever.  I mean, what does their worth have anything to do with it?  Is it ok to hound people if they are rich?  Are you defending their coverage of that?  I would suggest having a bit of a think about your values there.  Oh wait, you don't like these people, so its OK to hound them.  Got it.

As for the BBC not having to worry about ratings, I wish someone would tell the BBC that. Then maybe they could get rid of the terrible bollocks they screen at the weekends. Particularly given that formats like The Voice, Wipeout, Here Comes the Wall (I can't remember what it's called) are all bought in. Do we really not have any creative enough people in this country to come up with novel formats for gameshows or talent contests? Maybe not if I Love My Country is any evidence.

Also, using the nature documentaries as evidence of the value of the license fee is a bad idea. They aren't just *shown* around the world, they are *sold* around the world. They are made with the express intention to sell them around the world, they're a big moeny spinner. It might take years to make them but many private production companies would be more than willing to fund that team to do it independently.

&gt; ... they attack ordinary people in the street...

""They"" being those two men, that one time, one of whom had apparently been hounded and harassed by British Intelligence for years.

[David Anderson QC](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/10186015/Terror-threat-must-not-be-exaggerated-warns-watchdog.html) explained well *why* the threat is exaggerated:

&gt; “Terrorism swells the budgets of military, security, intelligence and police forces, universities, publishers and film studios.

&gt;“It provides the ideal reason – or excuse – for the introduction of repressive laws. It makes the careers of politicians, police officers, civil servants, academics, analysts, lawyers and demagogues.

&gt;“It sells security fences, armoured cars and CCTV cameras; and it attracts readers and viewers to the media, to the mutual benefit of the terrorist seeking publicity, the expert called upon to opine and the media seeking an audience.

&gt; “When so many people have a vested interest (whether they acknowledge it or not) in the seriousness of the threat, one must remain constantly open to the possibility that the threat is being exaggerated.

&gt; “The number of deaths caused by terrorism, in the United Kingdom and generally in the West, is small – indeed statistically almost insignificant.

&gt; “If perception becomes detached from reality, the consequence will be unnecessary fears, unnecessary powers and the allocation of excessive resources to the counter-terrorism machine.”

The only thing I think he didn't touch on is the way that a constant external threat can be used to manipulate societies into subservience and destroy the willpower and togetherness of the people. Luckily, I think people are wising up to it. Slowly but surely.

Because of that it's difficult to justify removing it, but restricting it to those who need it most is a step in the right direction; the problem with this however is that it is percieved as encouraging the poor to reproduce (and indeed there are a few people who have kids for the child benefit, though probably not as many as certain tabloids imply) when they can't really afford it - the better off are forced to consider if they can afford to have children and what they're willing to sacrifice to pay for children, whereas those who qualify for child benefit perhaps are not made to consider this, because the government pay for it.

To be honest I'm not sure what the best course of action with this is. A voucher system for child benefit, where the vouchers can be used only for childrens' clothes and shoes, school supplies including uniforms and stationery, food, child medicine, and so on might be the answer, but that creates a problem of ""othering"" the worst off and singling them out at the tills.

I used to tour summer school kids around power stations as part of an activity, I find electricity electric, get a childlike awe from turning the sun into power.  I like renewables.  But I am a realist.

People don't get what a big deal it is to switch on and off a generator,  it isn't like starting a car.  It becomes a kind of chronic ignorance, people often through ignorance will do unkind things to people they wouldn't normally.

Energy is a great example.  A couple of years back I was running some numbers and realised my parents were going to be struggling more to meet the bills.  I had a bunch of cash that I could spend on getting really good quality solar panels installed.  Everyones electricity bill has gone up to pay that £2k a year to my parents.  The very poorest in society are paying so that the parents of someone who had a few grand to invest, can pretend they care about the environment.

That isn't right.  That isn't just.  Why the hell does someone who's on income support fund my subsidy?  The poorest helping the rich get richer.  Nice one former Energy Secretary Ed Miliband!

However, the mortgage could actually be cheaper than our current rent (although this ignores the management fees). Overall it'll be more expensive but we'll get more in return. If we don't buy I think we'll move into a larger apartment anyway, I'd like an office (I work from home and work in the lounge at the moment).

&gt; Have you decided on an area you really love and are looking at it as a long term move?

Mostly. We like the city, and think it'd be good to be around for a while depending on how my wifes job hunt goes. We'd plan to upsize again in 10 years or so most likely.

&gt; I'll put you in the acknowledgements when I finally finish this essay!

You can have a non-state (funded by yourself and/or your employer) and a state pension. 

Everyone gets a state pension, paid for by the government, if they've made NI contributions for 30 years or more (there are probably some benefits related rules that affect this too, but if you work for at least 30 years you'll get one). 

A non-state pension is up to you to start, though you might get one just by working for a company. There are different types of non-state pension and rather than go into them it's easier if you read about them [here](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/pensionschemes/types-of-scheme.htm). 

You can have multiple non-state pensions. I have a stakeholder pension that my company contributes 2% of my salary to and I top that up and a SIPP which is basically a pension where you have complete control over how it's invested (the shares and funds etc). I realised quite quickly that I suck at stocks and shares so piled what cash I had in the SIPP into a fairly safe looking fund, now I only contribute to the stakeholder pension.",0,1381408576,null,0,false,0,ccots2i,t3_1o50cg,t1_ccots2i,t3_1o50cg,null,1429180675,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

There are myriad - MYRIAD - tricks energy comanies can pull to keep the cost of energy high. I'll give you one example... apologies for length. 

In the privatisation carve-up, Powergen inherited two small coal-fired power stations: Hams Hall, outside Birmingham, and Ferrybridge B, near Pontefract. They were used only in emergencies or during maintenance on the local electricity network, when it couldn’t handle the voltage from the National Grid. Soon after Powergen took over, it announced that, as a commercial decision, it was going to close both stations. This forced the Grid to upgrade its transformers in the area, to make sure local people and businesses never risked a blackout. But while the upgrade was being carried out, the Grid couldn’t be accessed, and Ferrybridge B and Hams Hall became indispensable to Yorkshire and Warwickshire. The stations’ electricity had to be bought by suppliers, no matter how much it cost. While similar stations elsewhere in the country were charging between £20 and £30 per megawatt-hour, Powergen hiked Ferrybridge and Hams Hall prices to £120. According to the calculations of government regulators, this abuse of market dominance brought Powergen an extra £88 million in profits – an extra £88 million, that is, carved out of customers’ electricity bills.

This, by the way, is not even slightly illegal.

defense representation comes at trial. these are court ordered/sanctioned bail conditions. this is nothing new. the reason why they have to be sanctioned by the court is because the judicial system recognises that these restrictive measures are extraordinary and need to be considered. the CPS wont bother applying for extraordinary measures if there isnt enough evidence of the crime in the first place.

these proposed restrictions to be placed on people accused of sex offences arent a means to an end. they are not resolutions or de facto punishments. they are incentives to stop the accused of offending/re-offending and they are measure to protect the public from potential harm whilst the police conduct their investigation into allegations.

If we want to encourage people to put PVs up.  Make them VAT exempt.  Make them a deduction against their personal liabilities.

I, for one, am proud to support a club that is not powered by big evil money, and this is the reality of that situation. There is something to be said for having players on their way up to their peak instead of through their peak and on their way down (Artetta comes to mind).

Don't forget that a lot of players (Baines, Lescottt) come to Everton as a step up, so the club, in a way, ends up on both sides of this deal. Buying the best from the small clubs, and selling the best to the big clubs. Sheriff John Stones comes to mind as a new addition purchased from a smaller club who will probably some day move on. Barnsley fans were surely sad to see him go.

* arrest

* court order

* release

?

because this is the real of it:

* arrest

* investigate

* charge - release on bail, release on bail pending charge, release free of charge. (option taken depends on sufficient evidence to press charge, this is the stage where the court ordered restrictions will be put in place as bail conditions).

* (assuming charged) enter plea at magistrates (who may refer to crown), if plea not guilty trial date is set.

* trial. 

the restrictive conditions (not punishment) are placed on the accused during the charge phase. naturally there wont be any restrictions if the accused is released without charge. bail conditions, in some respects are punishing, but they are not proper criminal sentence punishments.",0,1381411359,null,0,false,0,ccouerh,t3_1o2tj3,t1_ccouerh,t1_ccou719,null,1429180381,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

First step getting to Blaenavon to Newport, a £7.30 day explore on stagecoach bus looks like the cheapest (and only option). So lets take the 07:10 am bus that gets us to Newport at 08:08. This gives us lots of time till the next Megabus to London (which you will need as it is not is the same place and your have to walk to the River front).

Newport to London, Mega bus is £12.00, leaves at 09:45am and gets into London at 13:20. 

So Victoria Coach Station to your interview (lets assume that it is in Zones one or two) a day off peak travel card is £7.30. 

Lets say your finished by 17:00 you can get the Mega bus back to Newport at 18:00 (at a further £12.00) and arrive back at 23:00. 

Unfortunately that is half an hour after your last bus home. 

So that is £38.60 just to travel to an interview.

So no food or drink from 7am and a night waiting in Newport for the first morning bus home and you have spent 54% of your weekly income in one day for the chance you may get a job. 

Given the cost of basic bills (Food, gas, electricity, phone [as your not going to get a job without a phone number] I doubt anyone in the country on job seekers could afford to do this.

Here is the statement from one of the Zombie Walk organisers on the day you are referring to:

From [facebook.](https://www.facebook.com/events/278157772205995/)

""Hello Zombies.

This statement is for the pricks who set of fireworks in the crowd (I know who you are, by the way), the prick who climbed on the Police van, and all of the pricks that joined in after. Thanks.

Because of you, that's it. It is over. We will not be able to do this next year. We had large scale plans for next year, but we will never get permission for it now.

On multiple occasions it has been stated that this walk was not a political movement, we are not trying to change people's minds, we are zombies. We wanted fun, only fun. It was only ever about fun.

We had arrests for the first time in five years.

Thanks to all the genuine awesome zombies that made the event mostly awesome. Fuck you to the few idiots that fucked it up for the rest of us. 

Goodbye.""

The police later confirmed that one of the people (or the person?) who set off the firework was not part of the Zombie Walk proper, so you could see why the organisers would be concerned about having another group, over which they had no control, coming along.

sentence option:

You'll likely have to go to earls court and switch, but it depends where you're staying as to the  answer to that.  Go to [TFL](http://www.tfl.gov.uk/) and they have a journey planner on the top right of the homepage. Use that, it's simple. In terms of apps I use citymapper as it's fucking awesome but I never get lost as I live here, but it's good for disruptions on the day etc so you can plan ahead if you're sad like me when going somewhere. The trains here are simple for locals but I ALWAYS see tourists lost on the way to bridge or anywhere. Don't be that guy and miss the game or the start.

The platform at earls court can be a bit confusing as trains to seven destinations pass there. if you're not sure - take the train to Wimbledon.

Food.. I'm not a massive stadium eater but take £20 in case you want food and more than two drinks. I'd personally got a pre match nandos, plus you get to also experience nandos whilst you're here. You can save that for another day however.

Mother advice: It'll be fucking cold. You'll be standing around (unless in west stand then you'll be sitting) for around two and a Half hours depending on when you get in. I do this a lot, always underestimate how cold standing on the spot gets you and end up freezing my nads off.

You can only base your judgements of these players from what you've seen them play, and by that judgement I don't think either Townsend or Chadli will make the grade, particularly not compared to Lamela.
Townsend's obviously trying to replicate Bale's (current) style but the thing I worry about is that Bale always had a wicked shot since his youth at southampton he was blasting in 30 yard freekicks, yet Townsend hasn't shown that level of long shot ability, which makes me question whether or not he should be copying Bale's style to such an extent and shouldn't be trying to cut inside as often as he does.

Wisdom doesn't look anywhere near good enough, and Flanagan clearly does not impress BR. Sterling looks pretty terrible as a WB in my opinion, and Henderson is wasted anywhere but the center of midfield.

I mean, there is little actual reason to. The aim is to ensure people think that they are safe so that they go about their lives and don't do stupid shit, which is problematic. In addition, your views are largely irrelevant. You are a single voter, and this is not an election issue in swing areas.

The only downside of the current way of doing things is that the security services have ended up being so successful that people don't think they do anything, which harms their programs which now work and their efforts which are nearly uniformally successful.

The effect of the war on terror and gchq is that prospective terrorists are scared enough of the state not to bother. They realise we are monitoring them, that they can't have weapons sent, and that they cannot communicate via electronic devices which makes their jobs a lot, lot harder and makes spreading information and knowledge about terrorism a lot harder.

read the UK Government Workplace Pensions guide - https://www.gov.uk/workplace-pensions/about-workplace-pensions

basically, the way most pensions work is for example i put in 3% of my pre-tax wage. My company matches that. The tax that I would pay on it also put in by the government. So lets say that 3% is 90 quid - i actually end up with £210 going into my pension.

one thing thats worth mentioning is most people put in too little - MSE recommend half your age as a %age should go into your pension - ie at 22 11% of your income. At 32 i'm only puting in 6% :(

true,JackXDark,null,null,"&gt;Of course, it's worth noting that back when there was lots of work in south Wales, people moved there from the rest of the British Isles, knowing that it would be easier to find a job there than wherever they came from. And they did it without government help.

Yes, but there was also affordable housing there then. Or land they could camp on or set up temporary communities. Which is an option in some areas, grated, but not so much in London, and not something that can be done as safely as in Wales at any rate.

Also - there *was* guaranteed work there back then. Something which is not necessarily the case in any area of the UK at present.

&gt;Now that there is no work in this gentleman's home town, I don't think it's that unreasonable to expect him to do as people did in the past, and to, well, ""get on his bike"".

Saying 'perhaps you could consider relocation' is fair comment so long as it is actually affordable and viable to do so. The purpose of the original question is to ascertain whether it is affordable or viable. 

Some people have made the comparison with Polish people that have come over here and found work. The difference is that they seem to have done so in small groups, who are sharing accommodation, have trades that are in demand and are undercutting local rates and providing a better service, and crucially - also have places to go back to in Poland and aren't having to set up whole new lives in the same way.

You could say that it's the fault of unemployed people here that they never attained skills that are in demand, but well, what's the alternative - to make them homeless and let them either starve or see their lives spiral further downwards as they take out Wonga loans to travel to interviews they've only a small chance of getting that they're banking on being able to pay back once they've got the job?

'Get on your bike' only works when there are actually more jobs than job seekers and/or seasonal manual labourers are in demand. Which is currently not the case.

If your employer offers matching then contribute AT LEAST the required amount to get the full match amount. The match is literally free money, so don't pass on it. The government contribution is based on the tax you pay, for example if you pay 40% tax and pay £60 into your pension, the government matches it with an extra £40. There is also salary sacrifice which can reduce your tax and increase the amount you contribute, along with some national insurance things that your employer can do.

The rule of thumb is to contribute **at least** half of your age as a percentage. At 22 (same age as me) you should be contributing 11%. I'm contributing 10% (and have been for just over a year) but will be moving up as soon as possible. The basic idea is that a pension has huge value because of employer contributions, tax breaks and compound interest. The earlier you start a pension the better, the figures are absolutely crazy for starting a pension at 22 vs. 30, so make it your priority to be signed up and contributing as soon as possible.

Do not opt out of a pension if there is employer contributions available, it would be crazy.",0,1381420179,null,0,false,0,ccox9g8,t3_1o50cg,t1_ccox9g8,t3_1o50cg,null,1429179012,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

People don't exercise as much any more - more people can afford cars and so, more people use them. Perceived stranger danger means that fewer children play outside or walk to school (and because of this there are more road accidents. Children less road sense). More wealth means more electronic entertainment and so a more sedentary lifestyle. For some people, the most exercise they get is walking around the supermarket once a week. Our diets have changed too. We have more food, more money, more choice and are constantly told that we have less time. I don't remember the statistics but a large percentage of people consider heating food up as cooking. Food production techniques mean more oils, more sugar, more crap in processed food. 

I'm sure that some people have an actual addiction to food. But I think for the majority of people who are obese or close to it, it's lifestyle - making them aware of this means undoing a generations worth of advertising and miss duration.

If it's recently converted it should be pretty safe in comparison to 99% of the buildings in the country. The building regs are gradually ratcheted up over the years.

To me ""pace of the prem"" is possibly the laziest of all the lazy horrible cliches that come out of the woodwork whenever a new player signs.

That same logic and reason is being applied by many to find ways to save the planet and get rich while they're at it. We have electric cars, wind, tidal and solar power which are becoming more and more efficient as time wears on.

In Germany, solar power is now such a big thing that the traditional power companies have openly admitted in a memo that they run the risk of being made obsolete as cheaper solar panels cut into their bottom line. The dinosaurs running the biggest producers of carbon monoxide and other greenhouse gases such as coal plants have admitted that the renewable energy industry is getting more competitive than they are.

Tesla cars are currently the highest selling car in Norway at the moment. If this trend continues to pick up in Europe and elsewhere then the viable, completely clean alternative to the petrol engine will have arrived. Practical electric car technology is here, it's now just a matter of making it more available to the public. And yes, these cars produce zero emissions.

Plastics, the big waste product everyone's scared of because of it's non biodegradability and dependence on crude oil to produce is now available organically. We don't expressly need the crude for this anymore.

Its not fair to compare his foul rate with hendo because you rarely need to break up play when you're a RW. He played DM for us for a bit, so its natural to concede fouls. 

In general, he takes more responsibility when he plays. He'll try and start a move himself. Henderson is more like a stepping stone. I've never seen Henderson start a move from the midfield. There are times when he has the chance to play a 1-2 and advance up the field, but he just plays the pass and then drops back. Joe Allen makes those moves. I think he's more aggressive than Henderson when he should be. 

Watch his footage. when he played with swansea, he'd get far up the pitch very often. He's got a good shot in his right foot, is not afraid to run with the ball, and makes good defensive plays as well. Rodgers brought him in for a reason. 

""Way better"" is a stretch. Henderson has seriously improved this season, and has always been consistent, but Allen is a very good player. I think he'll prove that once he comes back.

true,CrashingAnalyst,eng-gloucestershire,Cheltenham,"I think I can fill in as I studied this subject quite a bit at Uni!: almost every IPO ever except ones that fail to sell their full allocation are deliberately undervalued.

The reason is because the immediate price rise of the shares after the IPO is issued leaves a 'good taste' in investors mouths, meaning they are more likely to hold onto the shares for longer which means the C-types can get on with running the business rather than worrying about the share price tanking and having to do ridiculous things. 

There is also in private issues the issue of brokers: brokers who underprice more, are more successful at selling a full allocation, so actually are more likely to get future business from new IPOs and also make good contacts with rich people who know that their mate at Barclays or whatever always hooks them up with good IPOs, so for all future IPOs he's happy to throw his money at Mr. Broker.

Consider the opposite: after the IPO Royal Mail shares tank by 25%. The C-types would be forced to take swift and decisive action which might not be in the best long term interests of the company.

To therefore guarantee that investors are getting a good deal, IPOs are deliberately priced a little below normally what they are valued at. Essentially they are trying to create a win win situation where they get the private equity capital and can be left to run the business, and investors get to gloat about what a killing their new stocks are making.",0,1381427596,null,0,false,0,ccp085e,t3_1o54cd,t1_ccp085e,t1_ccozcbm,null,1429177558,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

I've known two people who had sudden deaths without a will and I just don't have the words to explain how an extremely traumatic sad time gets even worse when both family and non-family members lodge claims against an estate without a will.

It’s a few pounds well spent and you can easily put clauses in to the will to save changing it.

e.g 100% goes to siblings unless they have children, then 50% goes to siblings and 50% goes to the siblings children which they can access at 21.

No big deal though, use that one or a laundrette until you can afford a new washing machine. £300ish for a decent one and most places will remove the old one (or at least they do with fridgefreezers!)

Bins - no, that's not reasonable. Every flat block I've been in either has a bin room or a bin area outside.

Fire concerns - Never had a 2nd exit in my block of flats. Can't say I noticed a sprinkler system either. You might get things like that in larger modern complexes, but this one sounds like a small old building.

Post access - not all flat blocks have key coded doors. Again, none of the blocks of flats I've been in have. You still have a front door to keep you safe. They probably aren't going to key code the door if the flats have letter boxes on the doors.

Extractor fan - probably a misunderstanding in the estate agent's part. Raise it with them so they know they made a mistake. Will you use the extractor fan? They're still useful without an outside vent because of the air passing through the filter.

Meters - yeah that's not practical at all. This place is starting to sound annoying.

So, a lot of the things you pointed out are quite normal, BUT if you're having these concerns, if/when you try to sell people will also have these concerns. Always think about how resellable a place is. Some of the things would put me off buying completely, like lack of facility for bins and no easy access to meters.

Removing the link between energy *costs* and prices would be a ridiculous policy, but it's certainly not unreasonable to suggest that the large chunk of money taken from bills to fund government-mandated schemes would be better coming out of taxation.

The energy companies themselves would prefer for these charges to come from general taxation. Most people would. The only people who really *don't* want these subsidies to come from taxation are the people in government. The Conservatives don't want to raise taxes and Labour would prefer to have a scapegoat than sorting out the mess (much of which they created); but the system as it stands is indeed horribly regressive.

true,KultureShoque,eng-rutland,"May Be Foreign, Beware","&gt; The use of coal and oil to power turbines at power plants is easily replaceable with hydro, tidal, wind, nuclear and solar power.

This is not a given. I personally think nuclear is too dangerous. The other technologies are neither proven nor has the work begun to totally overhaul our infrastructure to work on electricity. 

Also our food is grown with fertilisers made of oil. The soil is not capable of feeding everyone using modern agricultural techniques without using oil derived products. 

I didn't say all invention and technology is bad but the negative consequences of what humans have done with it far override any benefits since it looks likely that the changes in climate already set into motion will be beyond our ability to react and may very likely wipe out a huge proportion of humans living on Earth.

true,KultureShoque,eng-rutland,"May Be Foreign, Beware","Erm coal versus nuke dangers is a false dichotomy. 

Nuclear is very dangerous indeed. Japan's nuclear disaster teeters on the brink of getting worse with the magic fuel rods floating in a wobbly pool in the sky waiting for another earthquake and the company that is supposed to be responsible is lying about the severity of the danger. At least as I understand it. 

Nothing can be guaranteed properly managed. This is the point. People are culturally unable to take responsibility for massive problems without lies and corruption. 

Coal has been a disaster and nuclear is another one waiting to happen as hundreds of old plants are kept alive and no one wants to take responsibility for the insane costs of decommissioning. 

Meanwhile, as humanity is gong to have to deal with catastrophic changes to the environment there may not be the facility to deal with whatever tasks are required to keep nuclear plants from poisoning their surroundings. Look at the US, a country so dysfunctional that its own political class is fucking the state just to make a point. Are these the people you trust to manage radioactive resources properly? 

And what about the workers who dig the radioactive fuel out of the ground, are they safe? Would you do that job to provide everyone with fuel?

Anyway, a great deal of the infrastructure and manufacturing processes that nuclear and also solar wind and the as yet nonexistant tidal power need is totally reliant on fossil fuels and the industrial machine it powers. 

Oil is getting harder to extract hence digging up Canada and putting it in a washing machine. It is getting more expensive over time and you can't take for granted that existing supplies of fossil fuels can be phased out and non fossil fuels phased in smoothly. 

Now think about all the cars, lorries, trains, planes and anything else that uses liquid fossil fuels. How is all of that going to be replaced by electrically powered vehicles? When is the work going to start? An electric Lotus Elise is not really impressing me at the moment.

Now that subsidy is extended to everyone, regardless of where they choose to study within the UK.

The RBCT (Krebs trial) was set up to be a bells-and-whistles modern scientific trial. However there were serious issues with its methodology (see link). It has nothing to say about gassing because they didn't do it, and its inefficient culling managed in some areas to *increase* bTB transmission because of the perturbation. 

There is ample evidence that efficient culling of badgers where bTB is endemic, along with quick removal of any reactor cattle can vastly reduce the prevelance of bTB in both cattle and badger populations - because we've already managed to do it once, between the 1930s and 1980s (see also Thornbury (link)). bTB is a horrible disease in badgers - it kills very slowly, so that it doesn't 'run through' a sett but simply remains, each new generation being infected by the last.

Some missiles can look for engine-like IR signatures.  Some flare systems can make IR signatures like engines.  So some missiles look for both IR and UV signatures.  Some missiles are both IR and active (have a radar built in.)  So on and so forth.

The ""porn filter"" the government are suggesting is implemented is opt-out. I.e. your internet is automatically filtered (by your ISP not the government, a major difference) unless you tell them not too. That is what most people (on this sub at least) have a problem with. I have no problem with an opt-in filter but an opt-out filter is at worst a pain to most people and at most an unavoidable censor to those who don't understand what's going on (the very technolology challenged and those who don't care (and their families which is bad)). 

Forcing ISPs to implement some kind of opt-in filter with a simple set-up is fine imho as long as warnings are given stating that filters are not perfect and will possibly block the wrong content and not block content that is meant to be blocked.

From the discovery of the tuberculin test in the 1930s, culling of reactor cattle along with culling (by gassing) of infected badgers around the farm massively reduced the extent of the disease. Unfortunately, welfare concerns, complacency and simple cheapness dismantled this methodology in the 1980s, with pockets of disease left in the West Country.
