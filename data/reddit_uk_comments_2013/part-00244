I didn't say unskilled workers are uneducated. I said uneducated, untrained, unqualified people have unskilled work available to them but can still branch from manual trench-digging (as you put it) to shelf stacking, security, ramp agent. That's the point and that's a big difference...

When I mentioned new 'unskilled' jobs being created in factories you said security, cleaners etc are white collar jobs, hinting that they were unavailable to the recently unemployed workers. Hence why I made the above point.

I'm really not sure if you intentionally twisted it or just misinterpreted it.

&gt;The problem isn't one of retraining everyone, it's that what new field this technology creates won't require as many people as the technology itself replaced...........

&gt;.........you've still got 30 people kicking their heels. They aren't needed to either work or fix the machine.

This was the post I responded to, where you failed to recognise that  some jobs would be created for them in said factory that was 'taking' their jobs in the first place. Add that to the few workers that would be retrained anyway. Add that to jobs in other industries that will become available to them as a result of profits being re-invested (dependent on government getting policy right) and you do not have 35/40 ex trench diggers twiddling their thumbs. Maybe it's 10, maybe it's 20, it's unlikely that it's 35. Hence 'exaggerate'. And exaggerate isn't an advanced word? 

Roomba hasn't replaced cleaners in any office I have temp'd in yet. But it's coming. But guess what, the work force is changing too...educated to a GCSE level and a lot to an A level (possible extra help depending on the government) and a ridiculous number of university graduates in the last 20 years. If we don't 'automate', with R&amp;D staff, mechanics, engineers, repair men, sales men and admin staff in your JCB example then that's the alternative I was talking about - unemployment, just in another area. But less competitive globaly...yep that's going to help us all.

You glazed over this point about the opportunity cost of potential unemployment if we do not move towards the white collar area.


*Edit*

*Also, importing goods rather then making them.*

*Also, influx of migrant unskilled workers (for the apparent unskilled deficit we had)  that displaced workers.*

*Also competition and tax laws and incentives to make sure profits don't go overseas and are either re-invested or given to workers - addressing some wage inequality. Money they are likely to spend here that will in turn create more jobs -money multiplier affect*

*But noo...it's 'technology' that's the big scary bogey man*

we are in a constant transition. we can't just freeze jobs. we would still be using horse and cart because automobiles would put horse owners and cart carpenters out of business.

In [The Night of the Doctor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-U3jrS-uhuo&amp;sns=fb) prequel to the 50th, we get a few more insights.  8 knew what had to be done. He knew he'd have to break the promise of The Doctor. So he took a temporary hiatus from that name and that promise, but took a new name and made a very different promise. I think it explains a lot about 9 as well. He had to grieve the deaths of entire species, but also the true death of himself not once, but twice as 8 truly died to give rise to John Hurt (presumably The Warrior) and then he died truly again to become 9. And furthermore it says a lot about the 11-River Song plot line since that was called A Good Man Goes to War when we are now seeing that The Doctor-A Good Man was unable to go to war if it meant breaking the promise of being The Doctor.

Britain does not and never has had the same deep-rooted belief in personal freedoms. Even in the great economic liberal experiment of Victorian laissez-faire, which idolised small Government, that was only really applied on the economic side; there were still hundreds of laws restricting what you could do, especially if you were poor.

So this historical culture means that when the Government passes a law making something illegal, then as long as it seems reasonable the majority of Britons won't get too upset about it.

Line something up that's more money... then they'll either negotiate, or you get a higher paid role. 

Second job I had, I was under market rate by a bit, as I didn't get any pay rises there. The MD was going to try and negotiate with me, but when he found out there was 5k in it (though he'd have to do 6 or better to get me to stay at that point) he wished me luck :P. 

Kinda felt sorry for the people in my 2nd job. Most of the people were nice, the management stupid, and the MD tight-fisted. I did inform some of them how grossly underpaid they all were, but I don't think any of them escaped.

true,SillyNonsense,troughton,Troughton,"&gt;Capaldi is the 13th regeneration.

You're right. 13th regeneration, 14th body. (*Classically, do TimeLords have 13 regenerations, or 13 bodies? I forget. Depending on the answer, Capaldi might have no regenerative capabilities if Moffat is to honor that rule.*) 

I thought that was interesting to note. Moffat considers Tennant to be both the 11th and 12th bodies of this character thanks to his hand-regeneration trick, even though he is only the 10th ""Doctor.""

*Though I am not sure if I personally would count Tennant as two. I thought the whole point was that he used just enough regeneration energy to heal his existing body, not to regenerate an identical one. Under that school of thought, it would make Capaldi the 13th body. But hey, Moffat's the boss right now and I think it's a neat idea, so why not? Tennant regenerated an identical, new body to use.*

Anyway, on to counting the bodies...

One-Hartnell,

Two-Troughton, 

Three-Pertwee, 

Four-TBaker, 

Five-Davison, 

Six-CBaker, 

Seven-McCoy, 

Eight-McGann, 

Nine-Hurt, 

Ten-Eccleston, 

Eleven-Tennant 1, 

Twelve-Tennant 2, 

Thirteen-Smith,

3) Student loans are available to all who get into university.

4) A 2:2 degree at a university like Essex or Brunel is very achievable with hard work or average intelligence. I went to Lancaster and people did the same there in some degrees without being particularly bright.

5) A 2:2 degree at a top 50 university is enough to get you a decent job that will make ~£30k in a few years

The other is called ""Last Day,"" per the BBFC.  In my write-up I speculate that it will be a ""bookend"" to TNotD.

Cyclists have a lot of great points, they *should* be given room, they should be allowed to take central position on the road, they should have more space given to them than just a 1ft wide cycle lane

*but* sharing space with metal boxes is never, ever going to end well. There are far too many places around it that a man on a bike just can't be noticed in. Motorcycles at the very least have crash helmets, full leathers, power and noise to help them out. 

If you watch the motobloggers; like [Baron von Grumble](http://www.youtube.com/user/BaronVonGrumble) ; what you see is when they get squeezed they go into neutral and rev the arse off the bike. The cyclists though can generally just shout. What I think is that if you hear a revving engine you know it's traffic related, you know it's something you need to pay attention to and an immediate connection is made. I'm not sure you get that with a shout, I think it takes a split second longer and that split second is all it takes when what you are squeezing is just a guy in shorts with no alternatives available to them.

**EDIT** For some reason people seem to think I'm blaming cyclists. I'm not. I also don't think cycling should be banned or any of that ridiculous shit. I simply don't think that bicycles and 30t lorries sharing the same bit of tarmac can be made safe by a bit of paint or an improved highway code. It can't be beyond the wit of man to figure out a way to physically separate the two for the good of everyone involved *even* in congested cities. A light railing would do, hell it would double up as a barrier to stop people just crossing anywhere instead of at junctions. 

I simply don't think you can rely on people to be nice, attentive and responsible. You need a very definite distinction between right and wrong that has visible consequences. If there was a railing you'd have to go through it to hit a cyclist, not just misjudge how close you can get to them whilst passing.",0,1384546759,null,0,1384563904,0,cdf6mdy,t3_1qpid8,t1_cdf6mdy,t3_1qpid8,null,1428645490,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

While it doesn't fully answer your questions, I do think it explains some of the problems with the Bow roundabout. For example, when standing at the crossing where two women were killed, it is hard to see traffic that is turning left. Your view is obscured by the Tesco advertising boards. I don't think this alone caused their deaths, I believe it's a number of factors, which I kinda tried to cover in my post. 

One thing I missed is the huge blind spot that those tipper trucks have. The driver is up quite high, which I guess makes it really difficult to see cyclists on their near side. The golden rule for cycling is never, ever, go up the inside of a truck. A policemen commented once (don't remember where) that this is many times more risky than riding without a helmet.

&gt;I'm starting to wonder if those arrogant lycra-clad self-labelling ""cyclists"" are realising that in spite of all their claims of ""rights"" that they are, in fact, pretty vulnerable alongside traffic.

Well duh...ofcourse they know this. The problem is if they don't fight there corner nothing we change.

And in my experience there ""rights"" as you say are just that...rights that have to be fought 

Isn't it a shame that they often have to fight for these rights because most drivers don't understand the actions that cyclists have to take.

Note. I don't mean that in a bad way. My point is the education is lacking. It's an historical problem.

&gt;less frustration for motorists

My opinion....tough.

Here's the thing, most drivers who get frustrated shouldn't be on the roads. If a cyclists slows you down tough. The roads there for sharing. I'm genuinely fed up with this attitude.

&gt;The idea that someone is a ""cyclist"" and thus in a war with ""motorists"" is ludicrous. 

Yes...and no doubt that war with cyclists is not helped when you use language like ""arrogant Lycra clad self-labelling cyclists"".

&gt;Cyclists should be motorists also 

What would be more useful is if drivers where cyclists. Here's why....86% or 90% (depending on article) of cyclists have a driving license. Do you think 86% of drivers have any clue of what it's like to be a cyclist?

As for ...

&gt;appreciation for the road rules.

Never see cars speed, park In cycle lanes, park on pavements , tailgate, use their phones. Ever wonder why the government has to spend money of speed calming measures...and idea how many die each year because of this?


&gt;Thus this idea that the ""motorist"" is their enemy is stupid.

99% of cyclists have no problem with motorists (most cyclists are motorists). What cyclists have problems with are people who might put their lives in danger. Be that bad drivers, other cyclists, or bad road design. 

It's never about ""motorists"" as a group.

&gt;Not least because they'll probably die if they really think they can play chicken with a car and win.

Many who cycle would say that since it's not them introducing the danger, and they have been on the roads longer, and every version of the Highway Code makes notes to be aware, make space, and treat cyclists with care...and statistically it's not them causing their deaths then maybe, just maybe it should be reckless drivers who shouldn't be on the road.

I'm sure that will get down voted for being self righteous...but since becoming a keen cyclist I'm very aware of the shit attitude some (cyclists inc) have. Not only is it a danger to cyclists, it's a danger to everyone.

Usually when I raise points such as this there is an inconsistency with the poster's line of thinking which betrays that what they are saying about the elite is more emotion based than logic based. So although I disagree with you, I can follow the logic. 

I don't think that working-middle class people like myself vote, for instance, Conservative because I am being misled. Or because I believe I will one day be wealthier, and i'll get some sort of benefit down the line instead of today. I vote Conservative ideologically. It might well benefit me if a billionaire got their entire estate taken from them, but I think that is wrong. I also think there is a bigger picture to look at, although i'm sure you will say that this is because i'm brainwashed or i've been misled. But we are in a globalised economy. I think a lean state is necessary for this country to survive. I fully realise that so-called Austerity is causing pain and difficulty to real people. But I also realise that without readjustment there will be more pain down the line for the whole of society... it's just utilitarian for me. I'm not so stupid as to not see that both of the main parties are slipping in policies and deals that benefit their mates along the way, and I don't like it. But I believe that this is the real world, and as far as politicians go - using the world's other politicians as a measuring stick, ours are genuinely in the top 10.

Most cyclists are motorists too.  We are ""at war"" which shit drivers, not the people that give plenty of space and get angry if they can't get past instantly.

Just like people that ride motorbikes, there is a shared comradery because we all face similar things (the bad drivers, the wind and rain, the effort and fun to get places).  That's why people identify as a cyclist so easily.

Most people fighting for rights are just normal people trying to get to work.  

&gt; Cyclists should be motorists also - or at least have an appreciation for the road rules.

* The Master survived by travelling to the year 100 trillion, and having used a Chameleon Arch to become the human Professor Yana to escape the war. His use of the arch prevented the Doctor from sensing his existence. (TV: Utopia)  
* Whilst not a Time Lord, Leela was a resident of the Capitol on Gallifrey. She survived for at least a short time after the destruction of Gallifrey. (AUDIO: The Catalyst)  
* K9 Mark I survived the destruction of Gallifrey before travelling through time to the year 2050. (TV: Regeneration)  

**Daleks**  

* A single Dalek survived and crashed on the Ascension Islands on Earth in 1962. (TV: Dalek)
The Dalek Emperor also survived. He had fallen through time to approximately the 2,000th century. (TV: The Parting of the Ways)  
* The Daleks sent a time capsule to 70 AD Earth in order to spread the Dalek Factor amongst the humans. (PROSE: I am a Dalek)  
* The Cult of Skaro and the Daleks imprisoned in the Genesis Ark escaped the attentions of the Bad Wolf, having left the universe for the Void before the end of the war. (TV: Doomsday)
A group of Daleks that appeared to be Time War era appeared in the 22nd century. (COMIC: The Living Ghosts, Extermination of the Daleks)  
* Several Daleks who had survived several pre-Time War encounters with the Doctor on the planets Kembel, Spiridon, Exxilon, Aridius and Vulcan resided in the Dalek Asylum. (TV: Asylum of the Daleks)  

**Others**  

* Though Davros was believed by the Doctor to have been killed in the war (consumed by the Nightmare Child), Dalek Caan temporal shifted into the war and rescued him. (TV: The Stolen Earth, Journey's End)  
* The Advocate escaped the Time War when Davros was rescued by Dalek Caan. (COMIC: Fugitive, Don't Step on the Grass)  
* Eve was sent to Earth as a child to survive extermination in the Time War. (TV: SJAF 2)  
* The Gelth survived but lost their physical bodies, reduced to a gaseous state. (TV: The Unquiet Dead)

There is no blanket rule against ""all limited edition 50th anniversary posts"" so the fact you are consistent with it is irrelevant.  Moreover, there was hardly any such merchandise prior to my post.

&gt; The kinds of merchandise posts that we DO allow are links to merch that will only be available for a limited time, and homemade materials like on Etsy. We're clear and consistent about what's allowed and what isn't, and I see absolutely no reason to apologize for your case.

This is false, since the guidelines clearly state:

&gt; Merchandise is allowed in extenuating circumstances, depending on the interest of the item

Moreover, [plenty of mass merchandise posts continue to be allowed](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/search?q=bought&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) that had far, far less interest than my post.

2. The Name of the Doctor (2013) - The last episode of the latest season.  The 9th doctor appears who will be central to the anniversary special and probably a lot of clues littered in this episode that we don't even know about. 

3. The Night of the Doctor (2013) - Mini episode prequel to the anniversary special with the 8th &amp; 9th doctor. You can see it here:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-U3jrS-uhuo

4. The Sound of Drums (2007) The Master and the Doctor have a major conversation on what they both did in the last days of the time war and the end results.

5. The End of Time Part 1 &amp; 2 (2009) Rassilon and his Time Lord entourage are trying to escape the ravages of the Time War as it bleeds across the time and space. Big Clues to the fate of the doctor, the nature of the time war and the doctor's involvement in the last days of the war. 

6. Terror of the Zygons (1975) - The rebooted baddies that will appear in the 50th anniversary special. Source background information on their history and abilities in this Tom Baker era serial. 

7. Brain of Morbius (1976) The original appearance of the Sisterhood of Karn from the Night of the Doctor prequel. Background information on their relation/ambivalence towards the Time Lords. Also, near the end of this serial reveals an unknown past of the Doctor and possible explanation of unlimited regenerations. 

7. (extra credit) The Wikipedia entry on the time war refers to its background details, origin and historical progression.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_War_(Doctor_Who)

We don't specifically lay out every single possible category of merch that is and isn't allowed in our guidelines.  That would make the rules far too verbose.  Also, it doesn't matter how many other similar posts there are to yours.  What is allowed is allowed, and what isn't isn't.  There are going to be some borderline posts that can be judgement calls, but none of the posts we remove should be a complete shock to the submitter if they've read the guidelines.

You posted a picture of widely available 50th anniversary stamps.  That does not qualify.

&gt;Moreover, plenty of mass merchandise posts continue to be allowed[1] that had far, far less interest than my post. And it's not just little posts the mods may have missed, but very popular posts as well[2] .

Again, there are the posts that do break the rules that make it through.  Sometimes we let these go because of a particularly good comments section that developed, or some run through their lifecycle without the mods even noticing.  Again, we do our best with our time, but we are only human and the best way to keep this sub full of quality posts is to report things that break the rules.

But there's no way I could know about such a blanket ban, as it's not in the rules, so your argument benefits not at all from saying, ""We ban all 50th anniversary merch posts.""  Do you understand that?

&gt; You posted a picture of widely available 50th anniversary stamps. That does not qualify.

It certainly does qualify, since other widely available items are allowed, and the interest regarding the items was high.

&gt; The vast majority of these posts do not break our rules. They are largely self posts, stuff from Etsy, or the purchase mentioned in the title doesn't relate to the image.

There are numerous posts that certainly do break the rules.

&gt; Again, there are the posts that do break the rules that make it through. Sometimes we let these go because of a particularly good comments section that developed

My post had a particularly good comments section that developed.

&gt; some run through their lifecycle without the mods even noticing.

Because the mods play favorites.  Thank you for confirming what you earlier denied.

&gt; Again, we do our best with our time, but we are only human and the best way to keep this sub full of quality posts is to report things that break the rules.

Actually, the best way to keep this sub full of quality posts is for the mods to admit when they are wrong.  You were wrong with my post, so admit it and reverse your decision.

&gt; Your post was not exceptional or interesting.

My post was not only exceptional (no one else had posted pictures of the item in hand), but also quite interesting given that it received many comments and upvotes.

&gt; It clearly breaks our rules. I'm sorry you think this is unfair, but these are the rules that were chosen by our community and we're sticking to them until the community demands otherwise.

It clearly is allowed under the rule I already cited.  Also, the rules against merchandise posts that you're suggesting was NOT chosen by the community.  The community (me) is demanding otherwise, so please stop sticking to them.

true,cactuscat,cnty-wales,Wales,"Most successful people have to work hard for it. The privilege issue means that some people have advantages that make it far more likely their hard work will pay off, it makes it easier for them, they get a better start, guidance, support, encouragement etc to see through difficult times and make sensible decisions.

I don't doubt that more privileged people work damn hard because any level of success requires it, but they start one step ahead and at every point where they might give up or fail, there is more support and guidance for them. Those who are disadvantaged have that amount of work to do, plus working around a whole bunch of extra obstacles.

I wasn't too hard done by, but I lacked some of the privileges my peers had through school and university. If you are determined you can work around a lot but you are stunted by it. Energy you could have spent bettering yourself is used just to keep up. I can see why many people don't make it. I look back and I think how different my personality and life would be had I had better educated parents who supported me, knew the university system, gave guidance and all that fun stuff.

I don't resent anyone or complain, I'm doing alright with what I have. It's just a fact of life. Of course, I think my parents could have done a little more for me but realistically, they too are working with what they have and how they were brought up. 

&gt;Better that than sitting at home making up excuses and feeling sorry for yourself, talking about how you were never privileged.

I took no pleasure from City's plans being scuppered and now Rovers have to deal with a similar form of disappointment.

The various councils have always been apprehensive and rarely have any 'officials' (outside of the clubs) been supportive or pro-active into finding a solution.

Personally, I think that a shared stadium is a bad idea. It dilutes the importance of having individual clubs and would make me feel like both BRFC and BCFC had been quarantined in the city, rather than supported or celebrated.

They will put in the contract a specific clause that says ""You have to be available for reshoots, audio pick-ups, etc.  with this-much notice during these months leading up to the release.""    Any studio lawyers who didn't include these types of clauses should be fired on the spot.

And the TV show isn't going to want to risk a major cast member not being available when shooting on a very tight schedule in which they would have to have other cast members be available also.  

Think about it.  Thor decides to do re-shoots and calls Eccleston to be on set for 2-3 weeks, and this just happens to be when the beebs scheduled to shoot the show.  So now Ecclestone has to reschedule and the bbc has to reschedule with Tennant/Smith/Hurt/etc. etc. because Ecclestone got called back.  The BBC would be smart enough not to take this risk.

I feel like people are denigrating the good characters of these companions because the writers wrote them in sexist ways. Was Peri asked to sex it up by JNT for the dads? Yes. But that doesn't change how good or bad of a character she was. And when did Ace do ""histrionic damselling""?

The tendency to paint all the classic Who female companions with the same ""victim"" brush is a bit frustrating. Then we forget the moments of feminism that did manifest themselves, even in the earliest of Who. Like Zoe's intelligence being greater than the Doctor's, her defeat of the Karkus. The fact that Jo was an escapist and agent able to resist the Master's hypnotism. (And yes, every story with her in it written by Terrance Dicks is totally sexist.) How about what a strong non-sexualised character Barbara was? She's the one who really gave the first Doctor the slap back to reality that he needed. Tegan, whose constant complaining, was unbelievably human and relatable (not whiny at all). Liz Shaw the scientist who stayed on too shortly. Was she ousted out for the less intelligent Jo? Yes. Doesn't negate the positives of her being there in the first place though. And Leela, despite her revealing garb, was a wonderful character, strong and intelligent. Mel, a computer programmer with an eidetic memory. Sarah Jane a total feminist and journalist.

* I can see merits to the idea of a lean state, but 'austerity' doesn't seem to be helping anything and I don't see welfare/services as the first 'fat' to be cut. 

* Globalisation is something of a dilemma for my principles - sets workers here against workers elsewhere, with the wealthy executive layer winning either way. 

* I wouldn't advocate for ""taking the entire estate"", but where there are corporations and individuals with enormous profits/incomes and at the same time so many people struggling to even get by... let's say I'm not opposed to a little redistribution, especially if it comes through improved funding to public services that benefit everyone.

To insert a sidenote: Cameron and his ilk seem very fond of rhetoric about 'scroungers' in any conversation about benefits. I'll accept that a robust/generous welfare state *can* be abused but I think it's a vastly overstated problem at present.

Honestly, I think the measure of a successful society should be how well it supports those with the least, which (looking around at other countries at least) appears to be best served by lower levels of income inequality. Some inequality is inevitable, but even while economic productivity has risen, a smaller share of those gains have been going to those working compared to those providing the capital. Seems the only way to really make any money is to already have money so that you can lend it and invest it.

That element of unshared gains is the thing that seems most wrong to me - feels like unjustifiable greed for 'them' to be squeezing the economic life out of the very people who do the work that fuel their success. Well, that and the sheer scale of income/wealth inequality - I'd be lying if I said there wasn't some emotion based/visceral-level reaction to the size of the numbers.",0,1384560754,null,0,false,0,cdfc760,t3_1qoije,t1_cdfc760,t1_cdf8w4s,null,1428642817,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

And frankly you have to be a serious retard if you'd think the studio wouldn't lock him into a clause to be available at short notice while the film was in post-production.

    &gt;  
    Couldn't we just assume that the Doctor is observing some point 
    of temporal protocol. In other words the various Doctors can 
    remember the adventure from their previous experiences but must 
    behave exactly as they remember themselves behaving.  To clarify:
    Davison remembers his lines because he's heard them before 
    several times over and now musn't contradict his own history by 
    conflicting with his own memories.  He doesn't share his 
    fore-knowledge with his companions because, as he has stated 
    several times, such fore-knowledge is dangerous. So the poor sod 
    is forced to plod through the same cycle of events at several
    points in his history knowing the outcome but forced to behave as 
    if it's all a big surprise.  The Time Lord equivalent of reruns.
    
    Which means in ""The Five Doctors"" they're all only acting and
    it's just a pantomime.  Doesn't that have the ring of truth?

    &gt; indeed, past regenerations what strictly forbidden except in 
    the gravest 
    &gt; emergencies, that the Time Lords would erase the events from 
    The Doctor's 
    &gt; memory
    
    Not so.  Drs 1 and 2 remember the events of ""The Three Doctors"" 
    in ""The FIve Doctors"" (2 talks about Omega with the Brig and 1 
    enquires ""Where's the little fellow?"" on encountering 3.)  5 also 
    remembers Omega in ""Arc Of Whatever"".  I still think the simplest 
    and least fussy explanation is that he does remember but has to 
    go through the motions exactly as he remembers from the last time 
    round so as no to contradict his own history. This fits with what 
    he's always said about changing history and the dangers of 
    fore-knowledge.

It was atheism that informed the communists to introduce anti-religious laws. That is a matter of historical record, denying it is ignorance, it's okay to not know that atheism was a cornerstone of communism but in the words of Lenin -

*""Religion is the opium of the people: this saying of Marx is the cornerstone of the entire ideology of Marxism about religion. All modern religions and churches, all and of every kind of religious organizations are always considered by Marxism as the organs of bourgeois reaction, used for the protection of the exploitation and the stupefaction of the working class.""*

When the people behind campaigns of mass murder explicitly state that the reason behind those campaigns is because of their atheist beliefs it would be wise to try to understand that so it doesnt ever happen again. Do atheists need to develop a moral code that limits how far their bigotry takes them for example?

Any belief system can lead to mass murder and atheism certainly isnt alone it simply joins all those other brilliant human ideas down the ages that have led to the same ends.",0,1384563485,null,0,false,0,cdfd6fo,t3_1qowg7,t1_cdfd6fo,t1_cdfcp8q,null,1428642361,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

*Palmer vs R 1971*

""It is both good law and good sense that a man who is attacked may defend himself. It is both good law and good sense that he may do, but only do, what is **reasonably necessary**.""

*Section 3 of the Criminal Law Act 1967*

""A person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the prevention of crime, or in effecting or assisting **in the lawful arrest of offenders or suspected offenders or of persons unlawfully at large.**""

So, we have the paradigm - force can be used to defend yourself, or to prevent criminal conduct - that prevents self-defence laws being applied in matters where no crime warranting force has been committed.

Other British case law (check the CPS website for it) states that force must be assessed along two lines: Was it necessary to use force? Was the force used proportional, useful and not aimed at vengeance?

If someone breaks into my house and, after being confronted, they start to attack me, I am perfectly justified to use *proportionate* force to stop them doing that. No more than that. ",0,1384563565,null,0,false,0,cdfd7hf,t3_1qp8wr,t1_cdfd7hf,t1_cdf4pqt,null,1428642346,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3

Seriously, I'm pretty certain that the original reasons for having the ratio of female companions we have had over the years, is to fill out the obligatory ""scare"" factor by having a woman screaming somewhere.

I grew up on a council estate. I was the first person in my family to go to University. I have a degree in English and Linguistics. Whilst doing said degree I realised that what I really wanted to do with my life was help other people. So I became a carer/supprt worker. I've worked with homeless people, offenders, young mums, blind people, people wth physical and learning disabilities and people with mental health problems. I work nights, evenings, weekends, sleep-ins. I can be at work for 24 hours straight. I have to give out medication, I have to be aware of first aid, food safety, hygiene, safeguarding legislation, mental capacity legislation...trained in rescue medication (mostly this is for epilepsy) I have to do specific training for the cllient groups I work with. I have to deal with bodily fluids, I have to deal with being spat at, kicked, bitten, punched, verbally abused...I have to support clients through mental health crises (inclusing psychotic episodes) and autistic meltdowns. I've wiped away a client's tears on more than one occassion...for some people I've worked with, I've been part of the only family they've known. I've cared for them when they're sick, I've shared their good times and their bad...

I get minimum wage. 

I recently had to move clean across the country to move back in with family because I was at risk of homelessness due to falling behind with rent and bills because my paycheck just didn't cover everything. At the age of almost thirty I've been forced to give up the life I've lived for the last ten years and move into my parents' boxroom because I couldn't survive on my full-time wage.

So to those on the right of the spectrum who think I could somehow magically not be poor if I just ""tried hard enough"" - what is it you think I'm doing wrong exactly? My industry is poorly paid. I'm not sure what exactly I could do about that? Or would those people advise me to leave a job that I ADORE and try to go into eg a management position?

It's not that I dislike the idea of Rassilon being resurrected to lead the fight for the Timelord's ultimate survival, just that the way RTD did it was... extremely flippant.

He took one club to court over a Mickey Mouse contract. And it wouldn't happen with LFC. If a club doesn't want to sell you, you can't just sue them and make it happen. It would make contracts redundant.

Unfortunately, without access to my post no one can verify this claim of yours.

&gt; You seem to have some sort of delusion that we are ganging up against you somehow.

Again with the ad hominem.  Consider the question plainly: are you ganging up on me?  Your past actions suggest yes.  Could it just be unintentional on your part?  Sure.  The only way to demonstrate this, however, would be to reverse your earlier wrong decision.

&gt; The fact is that we're humans. We're all in college or working full time jobs. Lots of submissions are judgement calls.

A nice line, but it doesn't absolve you of guilt when your judgement call is wrong and clearly contrary to the rules (or when the rules themselves are clearly left vague to give yourself an out).

&gt; I don't keep a running tally of who the submitters here are, because it's such a popular subreddit. The only things taken into consideration when deciding whether or not to remove a post are the title and the content, and that's it. The username is never taken into consideration.

You can claim that all you like, but you can't prove it.  You may be pure of heart; that doesn't mean your fellow moderators are as well.  If you have nothing to hide, then open your deliberations for everyone to see.

&gt; I'll leave it at that. I'm not saying you have to like the rules, and I'm not saying you have to think we're doing a perfect job at them, but we make our best attempt at sticking to the guidelines that we have.

Again, your actions in may case demonstrate this is 100% inaccurate as far as I'm concerned.  Or, rather, if that's your best attempt, then you should not have the job.  All I can do is tell others of this and let them decide for themselves.

&gt; I'm sorry if you feel you've been wronged. You're always welcome to make submissions and participate in the comments.

A true apology admits guilt and attempts restitution; yours does neither.   My submissions and comments are clearly NOT welcome, since they are removed by the whims of moderators who decide to subjectively enforce rules as they will.

You seem passionate about this.  Of course, it could be just an act in order to give the moderators good PR.  But if not, you should know that your words alone cannot change anything.  You must act to right the injustices that have been wrought under the lofty banner you are now trying to uphold.

Trains are very expensive, they can easily cost £1000+ per year if you travel just 2 zones away. If you earn 20k per year then that is a serious amount of money, it can probably pay off a couples electric and gas bill for a whole year. I had a job where i was getting like £45 each day(not quite full ones) i done, taking a train or a couple buses would've been like £5 or maybe more and that would've been more than 10% of the money i earned, it's not worth it considering i could bike the journey in the same time. So that's why i biked there half the time, i stayed around back residencial roads because it's a busy area with narrow roads(1 lane each way pretty much) and lotsss of buses and traffic, it added to the time but it was worth it.

The other reason is obviously exercise. It gets rid of the need to go out or to the gym to run/bike after work which saves a lot of time, not that i used to do those things :p Healthier people also means less NHS bills, i have no idea how big the effect would be though, it might be a big effect if suddenly a couple million(uk wide) people rode to work/uni or it might be small.

Also you say that London wasn't designed for bikes but it wasn't exactly designed for all these cars either. Actually central London roads might have actually been built for bikes as much as they were for cars. Just think of how cars weren't really hugely mass market until like the 50s/60s i think and then think of how old most of central Londons roads are, they we're probably mostly designed for bikes as much as other vehicles. 

Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuBdf9jYj7o&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player), i saw it posted not long ago and i thought it was pretty cool. It's about how biking became so popular to get about in the Netherlands and the cycle lanes they have. 

Either way even if london wasn't designed for bikes at all, why should that stop us from changing it? Sure they can't replace lorries and busses but no one is suggesting that, we wan't safe roads for both. They can replace a lottt of cars though since apparently ""49% of the population in England and Wales travel less than 5 km to work""(Office of National Statistics).

But sure, I'll voice my opinion now.  People in the UK do not, and have not considered considered it important or desirable to maintain firearms for a long time, and I see no reason to change that.  Guns are not readily available and most police do not carry guns, so I don't think it is imperative in any way for regular citizens to own guns.  The genie has largely been kept in the bottle, and there is no specific reason to let it out now.  It is just not ingrained in your culture, as it is not is most of the world.

Here in the US, there are more guns than people, and no law is going to change that.  Gun control here is largely ineffective, so you may as well let people protect themselves.  And while incidents of mass killings (I grew up 15 min away from Newtown FWIW) are going up, gun crime and overall crime has gone down massively since the 90s, even though gun laws in most of the country are less restrictive than back then.

**Intro:** Fans overall positive. 33.7% very happy, 58.4% reasonably satisfied.

**Q1: Migs** - Overall, very positive. 

*Strengths* - shot stopping and anticipation.

*Weaknesses* - distribution

**Q2: Defence** - We missed Agger. Glen &amp; Sakho praised.

**Q3: Defensive acquisitions in January?** - Area we least needed to focus on. Possible LB strengthening mentioned.

Names mentioned: *Micah Richards* (?!?!)

**Q4: Midfield** - Area of most criticism. Comments incl. need for cover for Lucas/Gerrard. Hendo praised for work rate.

**Q5: Midfield acquisitions in January?** - Xabi mentioned by many, as well as Cabaye, Diame and Will Hughes.

**Q6: Attack** - 88.9% fans think Rodgers should base team formation around SAS. However, some felt they ""could work in tandem more effectively"". Lack of depth a worry.

**Q7: Attacking acquisitions in January?** - Attack not seen as main area of concern, but Diego Costa and El Shaarawy mentioned. Some fans hope/expect Aspas to improve.

**Q8: Likelihood of Top 4** - More fans (56.2%) confident of Top 4 finish than in August (50.4%)

**Q9: Other comments** - Quiet Anfield. Stevie 'sacrificed' too much and should be higher up pitch. Tactics need to be tailored to suit opposition. Youth policy ""ground to a stop""

Rovers returned to Bristol in 1996, to share the Memorial Stadium with Bristol Rugby, as Bristol Rugby's tenants. 

Upon 'our' return, there were people who voiced concern but you only ever hear from those people now, if any new plans emerge for stadium redevelopment or the current Sainsburys plans. I am aware of no campaigns, or local support groups whose aim was the removal of Rovers from Horfield after 1996.

As for a ""city the size of Bristol"", there are multiple cities around England alone that have two teams, with two stadiums and very little problem. Apart from the ten years Rovers played in Bath, there have always been two clubs in Bristol.

As for putting a Sainsbury's in place of the Memorial Stadium, I would agree that there are more acute problems to handle.

The impact on local business, traffic congestion and parking availability being the main three I can think of in relation to the area.

Parking and congestion would be dealt with direct research and planning in the application itself, leaving local businesses.

The solution for that is more clear than any of the other objections - if the local businesses are relying on local people for trade but a new Sainsbury's would take that trade away - who is to blame?

Some online retailers may do ""black Friday"" (Amazon started that one, and they'll prolly do it again this year), and there's the post-Christmas sales. Though you'll have to be careful they're not foisting off crap (is it me or are Christmas sales always more rife with offloading shit stock?), which is why it's probably best to shop around in non-sale time, to ensure you don't accidentally end up with a lemon. Is a bit debatable to wait for sales as sometimes there's a whole bunch of non-offers, but if you're in no rush, might as well wait and see what comes up. 

Did a google for console prices. Seems like the trend is a small drop at the end of the 1st year, then a more significant drop the year after. If you're mainly using it to watch TV shows, is it better just to get an online services box or a Blu-Ray player? I have a Western Digital box for Netflix, and that works fine for far less than a console - they're about £70-80. Blu-Ray player would be about £50.

 It isn't a new story, as much as a continuation of the old one. The only difference, being the 'time war/ last of the Time Lords plot', and that you don't get to see the continuation like you do between 7&amp;8. But even those things seem like they might change.

We speak very different versions of the same language, (*your* language, I concede) so there's a certain appeal to that.

Even some British dialects that are unintelligible still sound quite charming and endearing.

Ah yes, *that's* the word.  Personally, I find many of your ways in the UK to be very *endearing.*  Besides, I think Americans deep down aspire to be more like you in some ways.  I have heard multiple times that the racial tolerance in the UK is excellent, especially in comparison to the US.

Anyway, I tip my hat to you guys.  We do find you pretty cool for whatever reason, and I'm not changing my damn mind!  Just accept that we love you!

true,mushroomgodmat,null,null,"&gt;You've stirred my warm fuzzy centre but the pragmatist in me is laughing at your ignorance. Drivers have off days. Cyclists have off days
you are misunderstanding my point.

My point to put is in a more simple way is roads are there to be shared. Don't like it, don't use it. Don't like having to slow down for others? don't use it. ...take the bus.

I am more than happy with these parameters (as a driver and a cyclist), why does it seem many are not (that inc cyclists too if you're interested).


Why should cyclist or anyone for that matter suffer or die because someones having an off day?

&gt;Humans are prone to error

and they are prone to lazyness, and complacency too. Lets not confuse legitimate mistakes with speeding or aggressive behavior or simply not being considerate.

&gt;I think it's kind of mad that people want to share tarmac with an articulated lorry and flatly unfair to then abuse the cult of the underdog to play the victim when something doesn't go their way

Abuse the cult of the underdog?  Jesus....You know 3 pedestrians where killed in London yesterday right?


&gt;No one ever mentions cyclist undertaking in these conversations. Or running red lights. Or cycling across a pedestrian crossing instead of getting off their bike and pushing it across

Really????  have you been hiding under a rock? 

But anyway....Undertaking is mentioned a lot. But its largely irrelevant. And red light jumping is almost totally irrelevant (2 cycling deaths in 5 years in London vs around 50 deaths at the hands of cars).

You know when there's a car accident (about 7 car related deaths every day btw). Why do we not all assume that it was as a result of phone use, or drink driving, or even speeding?

The fact is we don't, because that would be a cunty thing todo, and we have no proof it happened and we wouldn't want the same things said about us if we happen to die in a similar way. But a cyclist gets killed it was probably there fault.....Cyclists seem to be collectively guilty in such things. And its not on, its not fair or right.


But lets talk about undertaking....Cyclists have a dedicated lane, they are moving in their lane. Three of the cyclists where in the cycle lane when another vehicle entered it and crushed them. 

The interesting thing is, if this happened to a car (car in left lane/truck to the right lane). The truck would be totally at fault. But because this has happened a cyclist (who, probably is evil, jumping red lights, cycling though crossing, undertaking etc) they have to shoulder a collective guilt.


&gt;Or cycling across a pedestrian crossing instead of getting off their bike and pushing it across

Irreverent remark - you have no proof those who dies do any such things, and none of them died at a crossing. 

&gt;Their always whiter than white

They are victims of bad design, and the shitty generalization don't help either.

true,executivemonkey,null,null,"British furniture, clothing, manufactured goods, and luxuries were very popular in the US during the 19th century, especially in the South.  They were so popular that a tariff on imported British goods, which was intended to help fledgling US industries in the north, was one of the causes of the Civil War (the south took it as the federal government acting on behalf of northern states and to the detriment of southern states, which didn't have industry and wanted to buy cheaper and higher-quality British goods).

Then the World Wars happened, and of course we were allies with Britain.  The US was flooded with pro-British propaganda.  For example, [this](http://i.imgur.com/0NrH89H.jpg) recruitment poster from WWI is a reference to the sinking of the Lusitania, a British ocean liner, by the Germans.  Churchill was admired in the US and we are still told that Britain was extremely brave and tough during WWII.  Military prowess &amp; courage are admired in America.

After the World Wars came the Cold War; again, the US and UK were on the same side.

The 60s happened immediately thereafter, and the Beatles and other UK bands were a hit in America.  Since we speak the same language and have cultural similarities, pop culture continued to flow between our countries and further cemented the infatuation (e.g., James Bond, Harry Potter, Dr. Who).  Even older British culture has a significant impact on the US: ""Pride and Prejudice"" is very popular in America, and there's a large annual [Charles Dickens festival](http://www.galvestonhistory.org/Dickens_Overview.asp) in my part of Texas 

Then came Thatcher; though I'm not fond of her, she was very popular in America because she and Reagan were so close.

At some point, the US began to like the Royal family.  Diana and Prince William expanded that interest into an obsession in the 90s and 00s.

The UK is also popular because it is different enough to be exotic, aristocratic and ancient enough to be classy, yet similar enough to be accessible.  Americans get to pick and choose the parts of Britain that they interact with; they typically choose the posher aspects, the better music, the tastiest biscuits, and the more inspiring parts of history.  Americans who have encountered British lad's holidays in the Netherlands and Spain, for example, have been shocked to see a side of Britain that they didn't know existed, and while I've heard Americans rave about Jaffa Cakes, I've not heard any of them talk about jellied eel.",0,1384595003,null,0,1384625598,0,cdflim1,t3_1qp5ta,t1_cdflim1,t3_1qp5ta,null,1428638399,4,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,4

Taking numbers into account (i wont even pretend otherwise) cycling is the smallest form of transport in London..

I dare say if those 25% where scared away, I knock on effect on everyone else would be awful. 

I was in London yesterday trying to get to Liverpool St and the underground was busy beyond words.

&gt;Does Boris want to be the mayor who bought London's transport network to its knees - delaying commuters, deliveries and business alike - because too much priority was placed on accommodating cyclists?

I think its a mistake to use this sort of language (although im more than guilty of doing so myself). When we describe people as cyclists we forget that they are legitimate members of society. Not some invading force looking to ruin everyones day.

Its possible that if infrastructure was improved that not only would it be safer for cyclists (there I go again!) but it would encourage others todo the same.

The long term benefit would be massive. The problem is ofcourse these are generational changes, and boris is only in power for a short time...

Also set a boot password and bios password which are different.

true,chrisjd,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"&gt; 1) It is not particularly difficult to get Bs and Cs at GCSE and A Level in the UK. Doing so can certainly be done with average intelligence and hard work.

I think that largely depends on which school you went to, which depends in which area you live, which depends on how wealthy you're parents are. And that's before we even get into private schools.

&gt;2) Bs and Cs at A Level would meet the entry requirements for reasonably good universities. Places like Essex, Brunel, etc

It's more like As and Bs than Bs and Cs for a top 50 university.

&gt;3) Student loans are available to all who get into university.

&gt;4) A 2:2 degree at a university like Essex or Brunel is very achievable with hard work or average intelligence. I went to Lancaster and people did the same there in some degrees without being particularly bright.

Student loans aren't enough to cover anything, if you don't have your parents to help you you will need to get a part time job. Still I agree, once you get to university your success is largely up to you, the problem is getting there in the first place.

&gt;5) A 2:2 degree at a top 50 university is enough to get you a decent job that will make ~£30k in a few years

No not really. I got a first at university and I don't earn £30K even with years of experience. The company I work for probably wouldn't even consider hiring someone with a 2:2. It will depend a lot on the degree you do, some will earn more, but many people find their degree is no help at all finding a job and still end up on minimum wage or unemployed.",0,1384600464,null,0,1384601285,0,cdfm6wk,t3_1qoije,t1_cdfm6wk,t1_cdf65np,null,1428638085,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,NotBaldwin,somerset,West Country,"A very good point well made. The occasions when I cycle into work in Bristol are usually absolutely fine, up until the city centre. The cycle lanes are pretty much just red narrow patches that join up the bus lanes, so when you're not nearly being merged into by a lorry, you're being hassled by a bus driver that understandably doesn't want to slow down to cyclist speeds.

Outside of the centre the city is actually fairly well set up for cyclists; most lanes are off road or go through parks meaning you're usually nowhere near traffic. I understand that Bristol isn't of a size comparable to London, but it suffers the same issues of cramped streets and poor planning that wasn't fixed after the WWII rebuild. 

That I think is the problem mostly. English cities have mostly grown fairly organically and without the major planning of most European or American cities, so implementing separate cycle lanes that don't cripple the flow of automotive traffic is actually an incredibly prickly problem. 

While I imagine it would indeed be possible to overhaul the infrastructure in most cities in a way that would not just implement cordoned off cycle lanes without crippling motor traffic, I imagine that the cost would be initially prohibitive to most councils. I don't doubt that the long term benefits would greatly outweigh the initial cost, It would be a logistical nightmare to implement as the city would still need to function while the overhaul takes place.

The Master then goes body-stealing for a while, he's offered a new cycle of regenerations in The Five Doctors, but doesn't get them. The Big Finish audios have the Tremas parts of him burnt away and he reverts to his Deadly Assassin self. The NAs have him get a new body from the Tzun. He somehow gets yet another body (I assume he stole it) and gets killed by the Daleks and then takes over Bruce's body and then gets sucked into the Eye of Harmony. 


Later we hear that he's been brought back to fight in the Time War; I think it's safe to assume that he got his new cycle of regenerations, and we see him regenerate once; the Yana-master to the Saxon-Master, but we don't know whether this was the first regeneration he'd used from his new cycle. He then dies and comes back and dies again, doesn't regenerate. 


So, the Master has regenerated 13 times that we're aware of, but would have had (maybe) 11 regenerations left if he hadn't decided to die. 



Here's a quick list of the bodies he's had:

* Delgado Master (I think this is referred to as his first regeneration somewhere, maybe The Dark Path)

* Beevers Master, from Deadly Assassin

* Pratt Master, from Keeper of Traken


* Ainley Master - Tremas's stolen body

* Ainley Master plus kittyness - from Survival

* Tzun Master, from Final Frontier

* Beevers Master again, from the Big Finish Audios

* Gordon Tipple Master - From the start of the TVM; probably was going to look a lot like the Ainley Master based on what Tipple looks like

* Slimey Lizard Worm Master - From the TVM

* Slimey Lizard Worm + Eric Roberts Master - He takes over Bruce in the TVM

* That one from the comic in DWM that I can't remember anything about

* Yana Master

The lane is for **all** road users, unless specifically signposted otherwise. Theoretically, cyclists should be safe using a regular car lane, but there is a culture in the UK which makes it dangerous. A good proportion of motorists believe they own the road, and that cyclists need to get out of their way. They don't leave enough room while passing, they don't check their mirrors when turning left, they have no patience (As if getting stuck behind a cyclist going 25 in a 30 zone is justification for revving their engine at lights, beeping their horn etc.).

___

I recall an episode of QI where they mentioned a means of making motorists safer; it was to have a spike coming out of the steering wheel against their chest. The risk of personal injury determines how safe a driver is likely to be. Cyclists have this all of the time, motorists meanwhile are relatively safe inside well engineered safety cells.

true,SocraticDiscourse,null,null,"&gt; I think that largely depends on which school you went to, which depends in which area you live, which depends on how wealthy you're parents are. And that's before we even get into private schools.

I agree that it's easier to do it if you go to good schools or private schools. But Bs and Cs are simply not a very high level of capability. Particularly if you don't do the hard subjects, you can get a B in something like biology by just memorisation and a very basic understanding. You really don't need to rely on good teaching to do this if you just knuckle down.

&gt; It's more like As and Bs than Bs and Cs for a top 50 university.

BBC at A Level and a C at AS Level is 320 UCAS points. That's a fair bit above the minimum for places like Essex and Brunel. Brunel's [website](http://www.brunel.ac.uk/courses/ug/entry-requirements) says three A Level passes. 

&gt; Student loans aren't enough to cover anything, if you don't have your parents to help you you will need to get a part time job. Still I agree, once you get to university your success is largely up to you, the problem is getting there in the first place.

They are since they reformed the new tuition fees system. If you're from a low-income family loans will cover the tuition costs and you [can also get a maintenance grant for living costs](http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/content.php?r=604-How-much-financial-support-can-I-get). Will you be able to party the whole time? No. Will it be harder than for other students? Yes. But will you be able to pay for everything if you are prudent and focus on studying? Yes.

&gt; No not really. I got a first at university and I don't earn £30K even with years of experience. The company I work for probably wouldn't even consider hiring someone with a 2:2. It will depend a lot on the degree you do, some will earn more, but many people find their degree is no help at all finding a job and still end up on minimum wage or unemployed.

Fair point. I should have made clear it depends on doing your research and selecting a good degree. But there are certainly lots of jobs out there that can earn you thirty thousand in a few years if you move to the right places. A teacher in London can get this. I think it's harder right now because we're still getting back to a normal unemployment level after the financial crisis, but I'm talking over a decade or so here. Plus, you don't need to earn anywhere near thirty k to be out of poverty.

In one of those videos, the rider deliberately moves over from the centre of their lane, to the right when the motorist attempts to pass (In other words, blocking). In another, they don't utilise the centre of the empty bus lane that they are entitled to use, instead they position themselves to the left of the right hand lane, meaning it's impossible for a car to pass them without undertaking in a bus lane. That's just inconsiderate. I wish other cyclists were considerate to road users, because then I wouldn't get so much stick from aggressive motorists who think i'm some sort of militant cyclist.

The tailgating in the last video wasn't bad at all. People rarely leave a full 2 second gap until they're on the motorway travelling at the national speed limit. People can talk up the highway code all they want, but calling a 1 to 1.5 second gap at low speed 'tailgating' is a bit far, especially when the van was clearly decelerating.

But what I don't get is how those women forced into wearing the veil are supposed to benefit from a ban. These are women who's lives are sufficiently controlled by their husbands/brothers/fathers/imams etc that they have their choice of clothing imposed on them. So what would those in the community say if a ban was imposed, 'Oh we can't make you wear a burqa anymore so you might as well go outside wearing want you want'? Doesn't seem likely.

true,theandycc,null,null,"Good cycle infrastructure is the most efficient form of transport in a dense urban area. A 2.0m wide one-way track can accomodate three people cycling side by side through junctions when they get the green light, and bikes pack themselves closer end-to-end than cars. Cars are 1.5 to 2.0 metres in width, but road lanes at junctions are ~2.8 to 3.2m wide or wider to accomodate buses/lorries. You can see this in videos of the Netherlands (Holland).

Even with **all** the space given over to road lanes for cars, you can't accomodate as many trips if everyone tries to drive.

About congestion, if London is transformed into a proper cycling city, the number of people trying to drive will reduce as people switch to bikes, especially if cycling is more direct (the Dutch get rid of most sideroads, as a safety measure and to reduce ratruns; this also means residents have to drive around a bit to get to the main road network while people cycling can come through in any direction).

I could also mention that mass car travel in dense towns/cities has negative effects on people and communities: noise, danger, air quality, bad conditions for pedestrians and bikes, unpleasant residential streets (ratruns), poorer social networks ([Research](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/19/ethicalliving.automotive) finds that people on streets with less motor traffic have many more friends compared to people that live on busy streets). Children are not allowed to play outside for fear of motor traffic, and their travel options are very restricted without easy cycling: slow walking, expensive public transport or being ferried around by their parents. Without safe and inviting cycle infrastructure, and safe residential streets, children lose freedom of movement.

Right now we have a free-for-all situation, and in many places cars are prioritised higher than bikes with all space given to lots of fast car lanes (Park Lane, Westway, A13, A406 and A3220 for example).

Even in a free-for-all situation (something like a two lane single carriageway, 30 or 20 mph), even moderate traffic levels push most people off bikes. People who want to try cycling, do not do so because riding with the cars, buses and lorries feel unsafe to them. So, they drive or take public transit instead.

TL;DR Bikes should get a fair share of space on the road rather than fighting for space with cars, because you can fit many more journeys onto cycle tracks (or roads with no through-motor-traffic) in a limited space, and excessive numbers of cars have negative effects on streets and communities.",0,1384607986,null,0,false,0,cdfn5qi,t3_1qpid8,t1_cdfn5qi,t1_cdfe2wt,null,1428637633,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

I think Superhighway 2 should be scrapped because it's a joke, but at the same time we need to accept that the transport icon of London isn't the bicycle or the rickshaw or rollerblades it's the black cab and the red double decker bus. We have evolved with automobiles. Where the hell are you going to even put cycling infrastructure? Close the Old Kent Road or London Wall and make them cycling only? There is no space for cycling infrastructure. There is just no space. If cyclists want to cycle along side two tonnes of metal thundering along at 30mph then fine, but it's purely absurd to suggest that cars and buses should slow down as a matter of course because a few people want to slow down everything with their precious green credentials. You can't drive slowly on the motorway, but you can demand that roads slow down for the precious cyclists? It is a public road. It's needs and characteristics are prioritised by largest demand, not weakest. What next? Am I allowed to train for my marathon by running in the gutter?

&gt;Undertaking is mentioned a lot. But its largely irrelevant.

&gt;And red light jumping is almost totally irrelevant

It is shocking that you accuse me of using ""shitty generalisations"" of abusing the cult of the underdog when that's exactly what you're doing. Cyclists are not absolved of their responsibility to adhere to the Green Cross Code because they're cyclists. If a car jumped a red light there'd be hell to pay and probably a nasty accident. And guess what? There would be little sympathy for the driver too. But cyclists jumping red lights is ""irrelevant"" because not many of them die that way? Yeah that makes total sense, mate. Meanwhile, let's blame the drivers because they didn't give cyclists the exact amount TO THE INCH as stipulated in the same Code you absolve cyclists of adhering to? lolok

&gt;But because this has happened a cyclist (who, probably is evil, jumping red lights, cycling though crossing, undertaking etc) they have to shoulder a collective guilt.

Who said anything about shouldering collective guilt? Lack of sympathy for someone who exposed their frail human frame to hazardous situations involving fast moving heavy machinery =\= blame.

Immigration is a product of globalist capitalism. You want the free movement of goods and capital, well, that means people too. This system has made some people extremely rich. They don't like to pay taxes on this though.

If we want to ""police"" immigration that means paying for it, and that means taking a slice out of our GDP, away from hospitals, education, transport, the military, and putting it into border control. But our government could never make this a state body, they would have to employ private contractors like G4S and serco to build prisons and employ security officers, then they would create a huge lobby that would never allow itself to shrink in size, never allow taxes to be moved elsewhere.

So we'd lower our standard of life and create a huge military industrial complex for what? So that the same rich people could have the free movement of capital. So that gulags in China can be used to build the next generation of throw away smart phone, so that farms across Europe can provide us with cheap food.

Yes, what's your point? I know what a blind spot is.

I'm not saying cyclists should take that risk, i'm saying that if an accident does occur, it isn't their fault, and never should be considered so. The burden is always on the driver making the pass, the manoevre, or simply turning left into a street, to make sure it is clear and safe. If there is a blindspot, then the mirrors that came with the vehicle as standard are not sufficient to allow the driver to check if it is clear.

You can get side blind spot mirrors which allow you to see if a bicycle is alongside the cabin. Or an even better solution is a side mounted camera (I mean, some HGVs have rear view camera, so why not cover the side blindspot too).

I have to feel for some of these HGV drivers though. Most will be given the equipment they use. They might hit and kill a cyclist whilst at work, simply because they couldn't see them.

Yep - and we all looooove gridlock don't we.



&gt;Where the hell are you going to even put cycling infrastructure? Close the Old Kent Road or London Wall and make them cycling only? There is no space for cycling infrastructure. 

No doubt helped by the many single occupancy cars filling up all the available space...

&gt;There is just no space. If cyclists want to cycle along side two tonnes of metal thundering along at 30mph then fine, but it's purely absurd to suggest that cars and buses should slow down as a matter of course because a few people want to slow down everything with their precious green credentials.

Not absurd at all. Youve read the HC, you know that cyclists will use the road, you know and should accept this, you knew this the 1st day you started to drive. Cyclists are not anything new.

&gt;green credentials.

Please stop with the generalizations

&gt;You can't drive slowly on the motorway, but you can demand that roads slow down for the precious cyclists? It is a public road.

well...Motorways have a minimum speed limit, roads do not. And yes, its a public road. That gives no priority to cars. 




&gt;It's needs and characteristics are prioritized by largest demand, not weakest. 

You're missing the point and the bigger picture. Its not about who is the largest demand. Cities realize that cars are too sustainable and may would cycle if it was safe todo so. Which would make life better for everyone. 

Its not about one vs the other, its about finding a balance.

Also....25% of commuting traffic in London is now cyclists. While they are still a minority, its still a sizable user base.

&gt;What next? Am I allowed to train for my marathon by running in the gutter?

When and if you get classified as a vehicle maybe you will.


&gt; t is shocking that you accuse me of using ""shitty generalisations"" of abusing the cult of the underdog when that's exactly what you're doing. Cyclists are not absolved of their responsibility to adhere to the Green Cross Code because they're cyclists. If a car jumped a red light there'd be hell to pay and probably a nasty accident. And guess what? There would be little sympathy for the driver too. But cyclists jumping red lights is ""irrelevant"" because not many of them die that way? Yeah that makes total sense, mate. Meanwhile, let's blame the drivers because they didn't give cyclists the exact amount TO THE INCH as stipulated in the same Code you absolve cyclists of adhering to? lolok


I think you misunderstand my point.

Im in no way condoning anti social behavior by any group - cyclist or otherwise.

My point is in the cases of deaths in London the generalization regarding undertaking/red light jumping is irrelevant because we don't know how they died.

Just because some cyclists jump lights does not mean these ones did.

And to assume they did, or to assume they must have because that's what cyclists do is collectively taring all with the same brush and ultimately doing those who have died and others that might follow a massive disservice.

Put it another way - Iv never not once in the last 10 years on bike or on car jumped a red light, Iv not cycled on the pavement either....But.... If I get knocked down and killed tomorrow people will say shit like ""all cyclists are they same, they all jump red lights"". Is that right?

When I bring up the many things drivers do, im merely pointing out the hypocrisy of such thinking.


&gt;let's blame the drivers because they didn't give cyclists the exact amount TO THE INCH as stipulated in the same Code you absolve cyclists of adhering to? lolok


I don't blame drivers - I blame the driver. Very important distinction. I'm a driver, I happen to think im a good driver. And i wait to pass cyclists in the correct manner.

What possible excuse can a driver of a larger, more deadly vehicle have for not doing so?

&gt;Who said anything about shouldering collective guilt? Lack of sympathy for someone who exposed their frail human frame to hazardous situations involving fast moving heavy machinery =\= blame

So now you are victim blaming...Ok..

I have an anecdote I would rather not go into detail on, but my experiences with the NHS has not been good, with one particular doctor being completely neglectful, leading to the death of my sister. This wasn't helped by the fact that nursing staff typically came from agencies, who employed foreign workers with a bad attitude, poor English, and a severe lacking of work ethics.

Even afterwards, it took several years of evidence gathering, arguing with the hospital, threatening calls and messages, falsified documents, attempts by the hospital to destroy evidence, and continued denial by hospital staff who were either guilty or feared being fired for speaking out, for it to never reach court because we couldn't afford it.

It's a bit of a vague claim - that ""capitalism"" is or isn't a ""good thing"" - since we don't have a very clear agreed definition of capitalism, indeed the original definitions were from critics of capitalism whereas these days revisionists are trying to relabel this corporate or crony capitalism, and people will strongly disagree whether a given society is really capitalist.  Is Britain capitalist?  Is it a ""mixed"" economy?  Are the NHS and/or our State education system socialist?  But there's an interesting art exhibit touring the US at present which asks the question ""Does capitalism work for me?"" (Yes/No), and they're finding that even the US is turning against capitalism as more ordinary people are pushing the no rather than the yes button.  Not only that but we need to ask ""a good thing for who?""  Clearly capitalism works for some people but not so well for others.  Some will try to claim the entirety of progress and technology for capitalism, but this is clearly a nonsense!. We cannot know exactly how far and in what directions the world would have progressed had we gone down different routes, but it's ridiculous to claim that capitalism brought us all the gains of industrialisation, cheap energy, technology, abundant food, medical progress, globalisation and the like, when it's clear that so many of these are due to external forces and in many cases State and community action antithetical to capitalism.

true,Seismica,cnty-uk,Teesside,"&gt; That kind of sums up my issue with the opinions of some cyclists. No matter what - it cannot be their fault.

&gt; That is wrong. 

Let's consider this scenario:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9-OxpnQF7c

and:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCfiYT_Aa_g

You can see in the second video that the cyclist took great care to pass the vehicle completely (so he wasn't in the blindspot). He then hung back a bit to avoid going into the bus driver's blindspot. The HGV pulled alongside him, he had nowhere to go. Had this happened 10 metres further down the road he wouldn't been on the inside of a corner and likely hit.

There are plenty examples of cyclists clearly lacking awareness too, just to balance the argument:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leW8Mx1GciE

Clearly the lorry driver was not at fault. He used his mirrors, turned slowly and left the kerb a wide berth incase the cyclists were also turning left.

You are assuming that all cyclists choose to go into the blindspot. There is a clear educational campaign, it's the number one piece of advice given to cyclists who use the roads. Yet the accidents still happen. You are implying that it is always the cyclist's fault if they are in the blind spot.

As for the recent deaths, I can't comment without knowing the specific circumstances of each. But I find it highly unlikely that they were all incidents where cyclists moved into the blind spot.

I'm not saying it's never the cyclists fault. I'm saying motorists always try and pin it on them even when they were in the wrong (For insurance reasons I guess, but if you just knocked somebody off their bike and injured them, you should at least offer an apology).",0,1384612873,null,0,false,0,cdfo26b,t3_1qpid8,t1_cdfo26b,t1_cdfnlm5,null,1428637213,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,JamesB5446,cnty-scotland,Cleethorpes,"&gt; Your average bike cannot transport a disabled person or mother + child (or children)... It's pointless to go there. 

You didn't say average bike. Stop moving the goal posts to make a point. A lot of busses are not accessible to disabled users. Many mini-cabs aren't either.

&gt; Also bearing in mind the climate in the UK - it's possible to cycle but not always the sunny pleasant experience we like and in the dark / ice / wet it can be absolutely dangerous. There are compelling reasons to have other methods of transport.

Of course, unlike the Netherlands where it is always [perfect weather.](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZMv3OB6XHvQ/0.jpg)

&gt; I know I'm focussing on the negatives but they are reasons that motor vehicles or some other similar form of transport must remain in London - without significant and costly restructuring throughout, it won't work any other way.

I don't know why you think I want all non-bike vehicles out of London. I never said that. I just want far less people driving short journeys that they could do on foot or bike if it was made safe and pleasant for them.

Do I think we should ban trucks? No, not really.

Do I think we should stop them using city streets at rush hour, fit them with technology to help the driver spot vulnerable road users and put in infrastructure that keeps them away from bikes and peds? Yes.

&gt; ...Which I guess comes to my final point in this (I know we agreed on it elsewhere) that drivers see cyclists as a pest because they can't always be sure of their movements, they travel far slower than cars (depending on the road) and that can cause congestion (again depending on the road) - to say nothing of the 'battles' between angry cyclists and motorists. 

I can't always be sure of other drivers movements. The average speed of a car in London is 20mph. Cars cause way more congestion than bikes. The battles are mostly cyclists getting pissed off at drivers endangering their lives.

&gt; The matter of education - I think - is a hugely important one. It goes back to the point I made elsewhere that like it or not, cyclists are not invulnerable - they are very vulnerable and as such even if it's disruptive to their cycling style they must cycle with appropriate caution - even if it means taking unnecessary action that legally they shouldn't have to take. Undertaking vehicles that can't see them? That's stupid. Yes there's a cycle lane that might allow for it - but if that vehicle turns and doesn't see you - you might die. For me - the choice is obvious - don't chance it out of bull headed principle.

Totally agree with all of this.

Until we have good infrastructure I will ride very defensively.

* Previous advances reduced demand for unskilled labour in one area but increased it in another. These current advances are reducing demand for unskilled labour and increasing demand for people with skills. To an extent this is an argument for education and retraining, but many people won't have the aptitude to learn the required skills however hard they try.

* The changes in shipping, communications and politics that led to globalisation mean that an unskilled worker in Birmingham is competing with one in Pluak Daeng. Until recently an unskilled worker in the West got paid a reasonable amount. Nowadays unskilled workers don't get paid much anywhere. This is rebalancing the economy because unskilled workers are either unemployed or don't have much disposable income. Allegedly Henry Ford paid his workforce well so they could buy his cars. Who is going to buy  consumer products nowadays? 

&gt;Why would you want to? 

I don't. But you can see why it's not working out in everyone's best interest. If no-one is buying consumer products then less people will be selling goods and services, further depressing demand: a classic economic death spiral. 

I think we should keep pursuing advances in technology - not that we have much choice anyway - but we need to make sure that everyone sees some of the benefits. I'm increasingly seeing some sort of [Citizens' Income](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income) as the only reasonable way forward.

Eto'o so far has looked worth it now that he's adjusted and I think he brings an opportunistic mindset that we need in our attack. I don't think Lukaku would have gotten the minutes to justify keeping him here without wasting huge amounts of money on 100k/week strikers that would be sitting on the bench. 

Frankly, I don't think the striker situation is the problem right now. I think the biggest problem is Ivanovic playing as our advanced fullback. He's just terrible at it and there's no nice way of putting it. He's great defensively and he's done some famous things for us in the air, but he cannot play a ball into the box to save his life. He's had plenty of chances now and shows literally no improvement. Schurrle needs to start playing again ASAP so we can get some width and not have to rely on Ivanovic to generate out offense.

I am of the opinion that cyclists should give room when there is adequate space to give room. In other words, if you hug the right of your lane (To stay far from the gutter) when there is nothing oncoming, not obstacles to your left, and you're travelling well under the speed limit... move to the centre of your lane.

true,scatters,null,null,"&gt; Your average bike cannot transport a disabled person or mother + child (or children)... 

Sure, you'll need a child seat. For babies or multiple children you can get a child trailer. Older children who aren't ready for their own bike can ride a detachable tandem. Depending on the disability a hand bike may work for some disabled people. 

&gt; Also bearing in mind the climate in the UK - it's possible to cycle but not always the sunny pleasant experience we like and in the dark / ice / wet it can be absolutely dangerous.

So... roads need to be lit? Icy and wet roads are dangerous to drivers and pedestrians as well, but people still go outside in winter. 

&gt; There are compelling reasons to have other methods of transport.

Absolutely, and they should be planned around the needs of livable towns and cities rather than treated as an end in themselves. 

&gt; Every single restaurant or shopping chain... every single business... from shoes to crates of wine to computers to stacks and stacks of magazines or business papers. 

I'm not seeing a problem here. 

&gt; These things might be shipped from half way across the country. They might shipped from *other* countries. 

No one is proposing getting rid of motorways, railways, docks or airports. 

&gt; Then there's the question of security: would your business or shop entrust its expensive wine shipment to someone who could easily be mugged on a bike? 

You say that like you've never heard of locks. If the cargo is secure, what difference does it make whether the courier is inside a metal box? 

&gt; Motor vehicles or some other similar form of transport *must* remain in London. 

London 110 years ago had a population as large as it is today, with no motor vehicles required. That London worked well enough to be the capital of the largest empire in history. Why can't we learn from history? 

&gt; If *that* is a given then we must have roads of sufficient size and speed to cope with demand. 

The lesson of 60 years of automobile culture is that roads can never be large or fast enough to cope with demand, because roads create traffic. The end result of that process is the concrete desert of LA, with ten lanes of freeway in permanent gridlock. 

&gt; If *that* is a given we have to look at how cycling fits around it. 

Or we can admit that cycling needs to be part of the fabric of our cities, and that motorised traffic has to fit around *that*.

&gt; Undertaking vehicles that can't see them? That's stupid.

Are you implying that this was what happened in the latest death? There's an automatic assumption that the cyclist must be somehow to blame in any situation where a cyclist gets killed or injured, and it's highly corrosive to any prospect of preventing future occurrences. Perhaps the victim was to blame - but I'd prefer to wait until the facts are available.

true,beard-maketh-the-man,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; I am of the opinion that cyclists should give room when there is adequate space to give room

Same here and I often do.

But just like the guy in the video how was in the centre of the lane coming up to a pinch point and then the parked cars, the van driver thought he was just being a twat (hence taking his hands of the wheel and gesticulating).  Simply because that van driver doesn't know why the cyclist isn't sitting in the gutter.

I get it all the time going home from work (Let me explain one small section of my ride home, sorry for the wall of text):

https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=leeds&amp;ll=53.752644,-1.599884&amp;spn=0.011444,0.033002&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=fflb&amp;hnear=Leeds,+West+Yorkshire,+United+Kingdom&amp;t=m&amp;z=16&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=53.752703,-1.59978&amp;panoid=LFTmQ_XYQqNgB-5ro-zolQ&amp;cbp=12,18.2,,0,0.99

Starting from there, I have to take the centre of that lane.  What most drivers don't know is the huge pot holes and bumps on the left and the only flat bit of tarmac is in the centre. . . plus there's the pinch point (the crossing) and there's always cars parked along the road where that van is.

I get tailgated and beeped even when I'm going fast.  I have no choice for my own safety.

Now as the road continues, again, what drivers aren't aware of is the poor state of the road caused by old road works.  Where it's been patched up it runs then entire length of the road, it's dangerous to cycle in there, so again, I have no choice to be not be there.  Plus there are junctions where drivers will not see me when pulling out.

I tuck back in here:

https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=leeds&amp;ll=53.75579,-1.596451&amp;spn=0.011443,0.033002&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=fflb&amp;hnear=Leeds,+West+Yorkshire,+United+Kingdom&amp;t=m&amp;z=16&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=53.756095,-1.596081&amp;panoid=IWTWvW7OF_tcMWiSlEuY8A&amp;cbp=12,19.55,,0,1.38

Just to let anyone past since the road is not too bad here.

But then I get to the real downhill bit:

https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?client=firefox-a&amp;hs=z5i&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;channel=fflb&amp;q=leeds&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.56643336,d.ZGU,pv.xjs.s.en_US.QSuMw9GwAyY.O&amp;biw=1919&amp;bih=963&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zIqHUsDfCIjT7AazxIDoAg&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAg

All the way down this hill, it's littered with damaged road and potholes ([have a trip down it in streetview, you can see it much better later on](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=leeds&amp;ll=53.76193,-1.58761&amp;spn=0.005175,0.033002&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=fflb&amp;hnear=Leeds,+West+Yorkshire,+United+Kingdom&amp;t=m&amp;z=16&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=53.761932,-1.587602&amp;panoid=o3oH8S8ZdHilYxfS1U_hKA&amp;cbp=11,35.79,,0,13.99)).  Combined with the speed I go (which if I don't brake, is over the posted limit) I simply must be in the centre of that lane.

Still get people speeding up, just to antagonise me.  Even when I'm keeping up or having to slow down for traffic in front of me.  

-----

This is the attitude most people are fighting against, this is what makes ""militant cyclists"" and it's not these people that are causing drivers to harass you when you cycle.  If a fast, fit and road savvy cyclists like me is getting shit just for trying to get home. . .  what hope is there for the children, or the elderly . . . or just normal people?

It's going to be a nightmare going home in the dark when I get back to work.  Not looking forward to it at all.

I just want to get around without at least one driver giving me shit, every single ride.

My first episode was Carnival Of Monsters which starred John Pertwee so part of my would recommend his first episode 'Spearhead from Space'. 

However most of his era was set on earth (minor spoiler) due to the bbc budget so it may not be quite a fair representation of the series. Another part of me wants to recommend 'Robot' which was Tom Bakers first episode (I've seen it mentioned in the comments) Tom Baker is my favourite Doctor and had a long running series (I believe he's the longest running Doctor) as well as having some of the best stories. 

It's a very hard question for me to answer, as soon as the Doctor regenerates things carry straight on so the very first episode of a new era can be a little confusing with references to older episodes and past enemies. 

I know my comment hasn't really been much help and I know I'll most likely be downvoted into oblivion for this but I say start with either 'Robot' or 'Spearhead from Space' and if you find yourself enjoying the series go further back and forward.

Or to get a sense of what it was like for me watch random episodes (most are split into 4/6 parts) then after that watch a completely episode with a different doctor.

It's important to remember that you're watching a reflection of the time it was made, that's part of the joy of watching old shows. You're right that the 1st Doctor adventures are more in the style of 1950s teleplays than the groovy-funky 1960s TV (even though they started in 1963). Some of the first Doctor stories are very much of an older era - I think The Web Planet has more in common with silent films of the 1920s than with modern TV. 

Two first Doctor stories that might be worth a look are The Keys of Marinus and The Chase - these both change location and supporting characters each episode, so you basically get a 25 minute semi-self contained story with an overarching plot that links them.


Because of the whole ""click factor"" I'd make these suggestions based on what will had retroactive significance:


* The Time Warrior (first appearence of Sarah and the Sontarans)

* Brain of Morbius (First appearance of the Sisterhood of Karn)

* Genesis of the Daleks (it features the genesis of the Daleks... you probably worked that out... And the start of the Time War according to RTD)

* Terror of the Zygons (will become important later...)

* Invasion (A great Cybermen story)

* Spearhead from Space features the Autons and it's also the first 3rd Doctor story, so that would probably also be good, but also spends a long time discovering things that will seem obvious. 

* Survival - features the Master. And the animatronic cat from Sabrina the Teenage Witch guest-stars.

* Maybe Web of Fear (direct links to the Snowmen), this is pretty slow-paced, but it's deliberately slow paced - almost more a psychological character study of people under pressure than the usual sci-fi/horror.


In terms of pace, I'd suggest Resurrection of the Daleks and Caves of Androzani; they're both pretty fast paced. City of Death is also worth a look, it has a lot of good characters and humour which ameliorate the slow pace. The Sontaran Experiment is only two episodes, which makes it the length of one of the more recent stories, so that might be worth a look.

While we gave huge amounts of money to 'Africa' via things such as Live Aid, that money wasn't always spent wisely and often ignores the context. 

E.g: Live Aid raises money to buy food for starving people in say, Senegal. Ship loads of food arrive in Senegal and put local agriculture out of business by just swamping the market with free food. Land prices drop, meaning companies in the North can start buying it up for Biofuel production, dividing communities and further decreasing local food production and increasing scarcity of good agricultural land.

""New Beginnings"" consists of The Keeper of Traken (introduction of Nyssa and the Antony Ainley Master), Logopolis (the last Tom Baker story) and Castrovalva (the first Peter Davison story). All 3 stories follow on from each other.

""Trial.."" is a bit hard to get in to at times if I'm honest but it's well worth a watch. Despite the problems it faced, it's still one of my favourite seasons/story arcs and really shows what Colin Baker's Doctor could have been had he been given a chance. It also introduces ""The Valeyard"" [spoilered in case you don't know](#s ""who is a distillation of The Doctor's dark side, existing between his 12th and 13th life"").



Other classic stories that follow an arc pattern would be:

- The Black Guardian trilogy (Mawdryn Undead, Terminus, and Enlightenment) which features the eponymous Black Guardian attempting to have The Doctor killed for denying him The Key To Time.



- The ""Ark"" Arc (Robot, The Ark in Space The Sontaran Experiment, Genesis of the Daleks, Revenge of the Cybermen and Terror Of The Zygons).

true,JamesB5446,cnty-scotland,Cleethorpes,"&gt; I shouldn't need to specify - I have not seen any bike capable of transporting a disabled person on the road in the UK. Ever. Same goes for mothers with prams.

Of course you haven't. Our roads would be horrible for disabled people and families to ride on. That's my point.

&gt; Curiously there was a news incident a little while about a disabled person who had trouble with a mother on a bus because she wouldn't let him have space - he successfully sued the bus company. Here in Birmingham all buses I've been on can lower themselves to allow access.

Those new busses are so much better, but still not perfect. If all the seats could fold then the bus could adapt to fit the type of users that were on it.

&gt; I'm an able bodied male with many years cycling experience and I have fallen off on a black ice patch before. Had traffic been on the road - I could've been seriously injured. The Netherlands is irrelevant.

Me too. The Netherlands is not irrelevant. They are very relevant in a topic on bike infrastructure. Why would you talk about bike infrastructure and urban planning and ignore the country who does it best?

&gt; Fair enough you don't want to completely ban motor vehicles - I appreciate that - but stopping HGV's using city streets during rush hour? Good luck! London is a business city as much as anything else - banning HGV's at any time will have an impact.

Most truck drivers and haulage firms would much rather make deliveries at night than during the day. The amount they would save in fuel and labour costs from not having trucks sat in traffic would be millions.

&gt; I do agree that technology to aid detection is something that should be further developed - I also agree that if possible an infrastructure should be put in place to keep bikes away from motor vehicles - but I do not know how straightforward that will be on a universal basis.

I do know. It's very possible and pretty straight forward. It would make using your car for shorter trips harder, but that's a good thing.",0,1384620893,null,0,false,0,cdfqbns,t3_1qpid8,t1_cdfqbns,t1_cdfope6,null,1428635984,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

[**Here**](http://www.ed.ac.uk/staff-students/students/new-students/events/university-welcome/arrival-weekend/overview) is some information about arrival in Edinburgh - there'll be a team waiting at the airport to direct and help you.


**Rooms:**
Student halls are the cheapest accommodation you'll find in Edinburgh.  If you've not arranged a room already it might be too late to get in, but you can always [**contact accommodation Services**](http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/accommodation-services/about/news/stilllookingforaccommodation) and see if they have rooms left. 
 
If you're renting a flat or room privately, avoid Grant Management lettings at all costs!  They're terrible.
 
There are usually adverts for 'rooms to rent' posted up around the university.  In the past year there have been some scams on Gumtree, where people try to get you to pay a deposit/money before viewing the flat, so be careful about that.
 
Student areas close to the George Square Campus include Newington, Marchmont, Old Town / South Side, Tollcross and Lauriston. 
 
**Costs:**
 
Expect to pay £400 rent per month in a private flat - electricity and heating is extra (If you are prepared to share, it can be cheaper).  
 
Student Halls will be about £200 per month rent and includes electricity and heating.
 
 
**Other advice:**
Edinburgh's quite safe even at night.  Pubs/bars are usually open til 1 am and clubs til 3 am. It's also legal to drink in the street, but you must stop if asked by a police officer.  There's lots going on in the city every night but if you're looking for student only events then some can be found [**here**](http://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/whatson/)   
 
**Tips:**
If you want to see around the country but can't hire a car, then there are various weekend tours organised by companies on the Royal Mile - they have advertising boards out and you can just go up and pay your money.  They'll put you a bus with tourists and drive you to Stirling/Skye/Loch Ness etc. depending on the tour you choose. [**Here**](http://www.highlandexperience.com/) is an example of one such company. (I've never travelled with them so I don't know if they're any good!).

true,RedOilSaints,lfc99,,"Personally, I think he's the ideal person for the job. I'm quite fond of him as our manager. One part of him I really really like is how he protects the badge. He follows the idea that Liverpool FC is bigger than any one player. In his first few interviews, he said ""I want players who will fight for the club, I want players who will die for the club"". Then during the Suarez saga, he re-emphasized saying something like ""He disrespected the club. He put himself before the club"" and followed that up by banning Suarez from training with the 1st team, and only allowing him back if he apologized (which apparently happened in private). Football is becoming more and more about money, I really appreciate Rodgers instilling a sense of ""something bigger than yourself"" here. Putting the club before personal pursuits. In a game of mercenaries, I sort of like the idea of having players who want the best for Liverpool ahead of everything else (no matter how delusional that may be). 

Secondly, I love his ability to adapt tactically. We've been a tiki taka team when needed. We've been a counter attacking team when needed. We've tried a 3-5-2, a 4-3-3 and a 4-4-2 when needed. He's really astute tactically. 

Thirdly his man management skills are top notch. He's motivated most guys, and I don't think we've seen many players come in here and not succeed. 

Lastly, I like his transfer targets. I don't think it's sustainable for a club like ours to constantly put 25-30M transfers in for players. We won't be able to compete with City's or the Chelsea's of the world. Instead we're using moneyball and implementing both 'steal-esque' transfers while also investing in our future (Chiverella(sp?), Canos, Yesil etc.). 
He's the man for the job in my honest opinion. I haven't had faith in a manager this much in a while. ",0,1384624361,null,0,false,0,cdfribh,t3_1qrouk,t1_cdfribh,t1_cdfraao,null,1428635431,32,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,32

Phone lines (and phone-based internet) is distributed from Telephone Exchanges to a number of roadside cabinets - these are green, approx. 1m x 1m x 0.5m, and located every few hundred metres in most residential areas. Your individual phone line is then run from that cabinet to your property.

BT Infinity uses Fibre-Optic cabling, but there are two main methods: Fibre to the Cabinet (FTTC) and Fibre to the Property (FTTP). Both have fibre-optic cabling from your telephone exchange to your roadside cabinet, but FTTC uses the original copper telephone line for the final connection to your property where FTTP has fibre all the way.

From your quoted speed, you would currently be under FTTC. It's important to note at this point that UK broadband speeds are almost universally advertised as ""Up To xxMbps"". The speed quoted is the theoretical maximum for your connection, but your actual speed may not reach that for a number of reasons - a big one is the total internet traffic at the time.

If I'm at a crossing with a 3 minute red light cycle that's on a bike route, I can be pretty sure that the chances of a bike ignoring the red light is a lot more likely than 1/480 (the odds of a motor vehicle ignoring it). Those are odds assuming the exact same number of bikes as motor vehicles too, if you adjusted for the fact that there will likely be fewer bikes waiting than cars, the odds would be even lower.

It may be based on anecdotal evidence rather than formally collated stats but sometimes you've enough samples gathered over your lifetime to be pretty sure that a low ball estimate can be met. Just like I don't keep track of how far I can throw a ball but I know it's more than 5 metres.

If you're interested in hearing McAteer, Berger, Smicer, Fowler and McManaman discussing the charity match pre-game, check out the last couple of episodes of the 5 Times podcast.  I'd also recommend adding this pod to your lineup if that's your thing.

Additional Info: The match raised money for the Hillsborough Foundation as well as other local South African charities and apparently became quite heated in terms of Kaiser Chiefs really wanting a result, with a lot of in-fighting as to who was going to get a chance to lineup against the Reds.

There is also a groups feature which allows for content and discussion based on different topics.

We are experimenting with different plugins so ultimately the features that are popular will remain while the others will be removed.

The social element works more like Twitter's follow system rather than FB's friends, so if people submit content you like, you can follow them and have their future updates / blog posts in your feed.

I'd rather allow anybody to submit the news / blog posts and let others choose who / what they like over trying to produce my own content, hoping others like it and not giving a choice. Let the most popular content rise to the top. 

I'm not sure what you mean by a social network seeming slightly redundant? Maybe it depends on your definition of a social network? Perhaps we need to rebrand that part, maybe that explains the downvotes?

We've had a fair bit of traffic and some good feedback, but not many people signing up or submitting content. We are going to update the homepage, which should make the options available more obvious and engaging. Also, the API will be available soon, hopefully that will increase the content a lot.

true,watcher1027,clara,Clara,"As a modern whovian who didn't grow up with the classics, it takes a few stories to get used to the pacing of the show (especially with the first doctor episodes).  Keep in mind, an entire serial wasn't really meant to be watched in one sitting.  As such, things just don't happen as quickly.  Episodes can feel a bit needlessly drawn out.  And our brains are really used to anything but modern day story pacing.  

That being said, power through because classic Doctor Who has some fantastic moments.  

I didn't do this, but I hear its the best place to start: Start with the third doctor.  ""A Spearhead from Space"" features the same enemies as ""Rose,"" and was the first episode shot in color.  Pertrwee is the first real action oriented doctor, so his stories feel a bit more lively.  Continue on from there and then revisit the first two doctors.  

If you don't really care about linear watching, do what I did and watch 1 or 2 of the ""best"" episodes from each Doctor (lists are already all over this thread, so I won't repeat).  You'll get a sense of each Doctor and grow attached to the characters which makes watching other episodes a bit more bearable.

1. Contact the actual foxybingo.com team and inform them of what their advertising teams are up too.

Im sure a tabloid would love to run with something like that.

2. Blog about it and share with the world. Make people aware of what is going.

As for FB, I'm sure we'd get money for that position anyway without having to sell someone else to pay for it. As ElevenRedsIII said below, I'd really be interested in Shaw.

No, it's not legal for recruitment agencies to advertise jobs that don't really exist. An IT recruitment company recently got slapped with a huge fine for advertising non-existant jobs.

There are many reasons why agencies do this, though. Primarily, they do this to build a candidate pool. One of the most popular mantras in recruitment is ""you're only as strong as your database"". Posting a fake ad allows the agency to populate their database with active candidates who can not only get them a quick fee, but also provide them with hot leads to chase. If you're working at the senior end, too, it allows you to build relationships to ensure that your candidates will become your clients going forward. 

Secondly, it allows the agency to get their name out in the marketplace and get itself some PR. 

In this case, though, it appears that this job has only been posted in several areas so he can attract candidates from all over the country.
