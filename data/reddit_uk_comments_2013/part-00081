I do think we need a new striker though. All really good teams have an elite goalscorer, and we don't. Ba is a good player, but should be a squad player on a top side. Ditto Torres. And Lukaku? I know everyone is really high on him, but I would like to point out again that while he has had a good season, he has a LOT more to do before we can start calling him world class.

What some of the more ""We hate Scotland"" brigade have done is what the UK government does a lot of the time, they discount oil revenue completely. If you discount oil revenue then the percentage Scotland pays of the overall revenue is lower than the percentage it receives in spending. Of course since it's Scotland's oil (well, about 9X% of it) by law it's absurd not to count the oil revenues as a Scottish contribution to the UK economy.

If you count the oil, we've been contributing quite a bit to the overall economy for many years now. If we went independent on the current budget we run on we'd probably have a few billion extra to play with each year, not a huge amount, but a few billion.

Where is the party for people who don't care about banker bonuses provided they aren't being paid by the public?  Where is the party for people who don't care what drugs people put in themselves, but at the same time don't want to be forced to purchase them for stoners?

I mention this because it's handy for building a mental map of where everything is, since so much of the stuff worth looking at revolves around the coast, the Victorian industrial heritage sites, and of course our rich history from the days of Empire.

Fountains Abbey was Anne Boleyn's favourite place to be before Henry the 8th decided to make life difficult for Catholics.  It's impossibly beautiful.  Just remember to take plenty of spare memory cards for your camera.

EDIT: I should also say that there are lots of great places to visit if you feel like a drive even further South.  The important thing to remember about the UK is it's nothing like they make it seem on TV.  Lots of green, lots of friendly people, and all accessible by road.  You could drive from the Southern most point of England to the Northern Islands of Scotland in less time than it takes to drive through just one US State.  The only thing you have to remember is London is essentially a separate country to the rest of Britain.  It's a great city, and worth checking out if you really want to stand in line with loads of other American tourists to look at things to do with the Royal family, but there's far more interesting things to look at culturally and historically outside of [the home counties](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_counties).",0,1366908392,null,0,1366908893,0,c9mgkan,t3_1d2308,t1_c9mgkan,t1_c9mf3bl,null,1431431887,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3
true,WArch,null,null,"The difference is partly due to the fact that Amercian politics is far more *polarised*, as well as to the right. Someone like Dennis Kucinich (for those who don't know, someone on the left wing of the Democrat party) would still be on the left wing of the Labour party, but most of the Conservative party would also fit somewhere in the Conservative party. To all extent and purposes, the whole of the British political spectrum would fit somewhere in the Democrat party except for a few nationalists, like the BNP, and very left wing socialists, like the SWP.

The other important thing is that some of those things aren't issues. Abortion for example. By this, I don't mean that they are simply an issue on the fringe right wing of the Conservative party, I mean that they simply aren't an issue that changes people's vote.

Take abortion for example, here is a YouGov poll regarding people's views on abortion.

http://cdn.yougov.com/today_uk_import/yg-archives-yougov-abortions-060911.pdf

When asked whether it should be illegal in all cases, 2% of Conservative voters agreed, 2% of Labour voters agreed and 2% of Lib Dem voters agreed. 

Does this mean that British parties are more liberalthan US parties? Well, if abortion was an issue, then yes, but it isn't an issue and if you are pro-life then you are just as likely to vote for the Labour party as you are to vote for the Conservative party.

true,chromofoam,uk,Hertfordshire,"Absolutely correct on Tesco land policies - used to work in Commercial Property and Tesco used to earmark a piece of land for a superstore and they would just buy up parcels of land and sit on it until somebody took a wrong step and then they'd swoop in and purchase the next bit, rinse and repeat until they had enough space, then they'd bang in a planning application, which they would have done Due Dil beforehand on so they knew it would more than likely be accepted because they can whap in a pharmacy, an optician, a café, etc.

EDIT: Not to mention their surveying team probably know the local planners very well already, which lubricates things i should imagine (there's a saying in the industry - A planners answer to everything you ask him is ""No"" - meaning even if you think you'll get planning permission or change of use, they'll say no the first time anyway)

Their small store acquisition programme is highly aggressive - in 2006/7 when I was in the game their target was 1 Tesco store every square mile in the UK. I'm not even joking.

It really is scary. I believe they were a driving force behind putting Somerfield out of business too who were absorbed by the Co Operative Food.

I also agree with what you say about the shift in needs - I remember as a kid it was actually preferable to go to the supermarket in terms of cost, convenience, service etc....now though, I think perhaps the quality has dropped with super-mass production, and also we have to remember that prices and availability is directly linked to trade imports/exports and UK Farming, as well as factors such as BSE, Bird Flu, etc etc.

Also on top of that compounding things, there are just too many bloody people on this Island and our natural farming resources are massively overstretched and we've switched from combined farming (farmers who do a bit of livestock, a bit of arable, a bit of everything) to single purpose farms churning out massive amounts of one product, and supermarkets are keeping the prices low because of their super strong purchasing power...

In my household we're aiming to start using our local butcher and greengrocer for things, and everything else we're going to try and get from the pound shop or Iceland or something.  Our nearest supermarket is Morissons.

The Scots/Welsh tend to differentiate a lot more). 

Essentially:

 'Britain' is: 
* England 
* Scotland
* Wales

Scotland is currently undergoing discussions regarding becoming an independent state, but this is unlikely to happen anytime within the next five years so for now, it's safe to continue including it within the banner of 'Britain'.

and 'the United Kingdom' is Britain, with the addition of Northern Ireland.

'The British Isles' refer to the entire geographic region including all the outlying Islands.  

As I said, when you're speaking with people you're most likely to hear 'Britain', though it's also not unusual to hear people become more specific and refer to their individual country of residence.

That's because the surveyors who acquire the shops on behalf of the retailers work to some tried and tested formulae (not actual formulae mind) - they know which neighbouring brands will bring them the most footfall into their store, so that's why you'll find Dorothy Perkins in roughly the same place and with similar neighbours in every town - sometimes they break this rule for places like market towns or very rich towns like St. Albans, Central London, Surrey, Didsbury, Bicester Village etc.

Also, shops are valued according to Zone values - the front 30 foot of the shop is the most valuable because that's where the most people tend to walk - they come in, look around, go back out - not many make it to the back wall, so all the newest, best selling and most expensive stuff is going to be at the front of the shop (if the marketing team and merchandisers have any sense that is).

Add in to the mix that most of these guys on a high street when I was working in this industry were paying £40k a year rent for a 2000sq ft shop (not very big, but expensive enough) add in the salaries and the insurances, and then their profit - makes you feel like a bit of a dick paying high street prices for anything once you work all that out.

Charity shops, Ebay and supporting your small local retailers is the way forward - this is also why I moved to Letchworth where major chains are banished from the high street on purpose. Look it up :-)

United fans singing ‘always the victim’ to an empty ground does not stop the manager thinking that a one armed Joe Allen can stop Ricky Lambert on his own. It’s not about any of that.

We are not building into Clara  like we did with Rose and Amy and this is a bad thing.

Ignoring the mystery, there's little reason for Clara to NOT travel with the Doctor, so you just take for granted she's around.  With Amy you felt like at any moment she'd run back to Rory or call it quits, and sometimes Rose got homesick, and we empathized with them. 

Fortunately, Clara is a phenomenal actress, strikingly gorgeous, and her wit when she's allowed to show it keeps her on par with the Doctor.  If she was one beat off this season would be a total throw away season. 

Journey and Name of the Doctor need to come through HUGE with an original plot (because I can't deal with another remade 80s movie) and Crimson and Silver episodes better build on Clara BIG TIME.  Unfortunately Crimson seems to be about the Doctor and Clara going missing - so likely another missed opportunity to get some new companion screen time.

&gt;David Hamilton (London, 15 April 1933) is a British-born French photographer and film director best known for his images of young women.

[...]

&gt;As much of Hamilton's work depicts early-teen girls, often nude, he has been the subject of some controversy and even child pornography allegations, similar to that which the work of Sally Mann and Jock Sturges have attracted. In the late 1990s, conservative Christian groups in America protested unsuccessfully against bookstores that stocked Hamilton's photography books.

&gt;As The Guardian wrote, ""Hamilton's photographs have long been at the forefront of the ""is it art or pornography?"" debate.

&gt;In 2005 a man was convicted for being in possession of 19,000 images of children, including photos by Hamilton. The images were found to be in the lowest indecency rating. In response, Glenn Holland, Hamilton's spokesman, stated: ""We are deeply saddened and disappointed by this, as David is one of the most successful art photographers the world has ever known. His books have sold millions"". Following the conviction a member of the Surrey Police in Britain stated that possessing Hamilton books was now illegal in the UK. Surrey Police later made a formal apology for this statement and admitted that no legally binding decision had been made on the work of David Hamilton.

true,digitalscale,essex,"Colchester, Essex             ","&gt;Holocaust denial is the act of denying the genocide of Jews in the Holocaust during World War II.[1] The key claims of Holocaust denial are: the German Nazi government had no official policy or intention of exterminating Jews, Nazi authorities did not use extermination camps and gas chambers to mass murder Jews, and the actual number of Jews killed was significantly (typically an order of magnitude) lower than the historically accepted figure of 5 to 6 million

Unless I'm missing something she doesn't say anything along those lines, in any of the quotes in that article. What she did say is offensive and ridiculous, but she says Zionists started the war that resulted in the holocaust, she doesn't deny that the holocaust happened, she doesn't deny that it was engineered by the Nazis and she doesn't dispute the death toll.

She's a cunt, but let's not go around calling people holocaust deniers when they are not.

 Edit: I was wrong, she did imply that they were involved in the Holocaust itself:

&gt;The Second World War was engineered by the Zionist Jews and financed by the banksters to make the general public all over the world to feel so guilty and outraged by the Holocaust that a treaty would be signed to create the state of Israel as we know it today.

The Bin collection thing is because local councils don't want to spend more not the companies, even if the bins were done by the council it would still be done once every 3 weeks as they are cutting back so complain to your council you want them collected every week, it's not the companies fault your council only pays them so little. Same thing with the NHS efficiently can only go so far sometimes you will need to spend more so just as we do now we will need to complain to the government to spend more.

Fans are clamoring for Hudd, and it's obvious as to why. But if Hudd comes into the 11, then I think Holtby makes the most sense of the Holtby/Gilfy/Clint triumvarate. Holtby provides a little more spine and defensive scrappiness which should help Hudd, who is not the greatest defender.

With a late lead, Scotty P comes on to cement the middle. If we are chasing, Choose from Gilfy / Ade / Clint to get us a goal.

The key point is that IF Hudd, then must ALSO include Holtby.

&gt;Don't listen too much to all of them telling you about the accent. Most of us are fairly easy to understand. Although every now and then even I have trouble and I was born-and-bred here.

&gt;Other folk have covered general UK stuff pretty well, so here's some Newcastle-specific stuff:

&gt;We have some of the most inner-city green space of anywhere in the UK. As long as you're not too far from the city centre, you should never be too far from a great big bit of parkland. Walk into *Jesmond Dene* [[parkland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesmond_Dene)] when you get here, it's like a great big slice of countryside in the middle of the city.

&gt;We're pretty well-known for our night life up here, in my opinion most of it is overrated, but you should be able to find something to suit your tastes. A word of advice, steer clear of the *Bigg Market* [[city area](http://www.pubsnewcastle.co.uk/BiggMarket.html)].

&gt;Us Geordies are pretty friendly for the most part, although not the same ""in your face"" friendliness you Yanks seem to have.

&gt;We fucking love footie (soccer). Well, I don't personally, but as a city we definitely do.

&gt;We have lovely beaches, and I've heard some of the best surfing spots in the country - shame it's so bloody cold.

You're doing it right - it's common UK knowledge that anything less than a quarter doesn't count at all, and saying otherwise will simply make you sound like a pretentious and obnoxious person.

For example: personally, I have seen some family tree evidence of Welsh, Scottish and French ancestors... but I'd never dream of saying I'm anything other than ""English"" in any context, it would be a lie because it's so far-off and unworthy of mention. Unlike Americans, we do not use this as a common boast.

In fact I'd say that anything less than *half* doesn't count, most of the time. 

&gt;But no one seemed to accept that and would reply, ""Hmm, well, I'm 1/4 German, 1/4 Italian and 1/8 Native American...."" I know of two very distant relatives that were from Germany and Poland so now I just say ""German and Polish"" without hesitation and that seems to pacify people. 

That will go down like a lead balloon here. Do not say this, stick to your original instincts!

You're from the USA, and that's enough of a conversation starter :) despite the current-events debates and politics of the day in Britain occasionally driving some very mild anti-US sentiment, most people here are pretty fond of Americans, especially the travelling kind. Do not be drawn into debates about foreign policy is another bit of advice: people often don't like George Bush, probably best to claim you didn't vote for him or support the Middle Eastern wars if you have to. There's mild discomfort of a perception that the UK government is the US government's lapdog, but unless you're unfortunate enough to meet a complete twat, that won't be extended to *I don't like you because you're American*. Our cultures are still very close! People may dislike your government, but they should give you a fair chance as a decent visitor, with a bit of friendly banter on the side. Besides, British dislike of another nation usually amounts to intellectual discussions, not burning flags outside embassies. I'd be very surprised if you encountered any strong prejudice whatsoever.",0,1366917415,null,0,1366918429,0,c9mk3jn,t3_1d2308,t1_c9mk3jn,t1_c9mcl0s,null,1431430150,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,favoritasx,null,null,"&gt;This ""putting Scotland down"" thing that we all constantly hear about is baffling.

&gt;-I think an independent Scotland would be culturally reduced to little more than a pathetic pastiche of itself.

&gt;-What are the Scots going to have? Ginger beards, wiskey and tartan...

&gt;-if anything I think you'll find yourselves pigeon-holed, as that's generally what happens to minority cultures. 

&gt;-Don't forget - the reason Scotland ended up in a union with England was because they couldn't raise enough capital to fund their Darien Scheme in the 1690s... so funded it themselves with 25% of their national wealth. Inevitably when it all went tits-up 10 years later the effect of having over-stretched their capital power was to bankrupt the wealthy Scottish land owners - and by extension their nation. 

&gt;-a small but ambitious Scotland talks big on paper, but may well fail to deliver. Knowing their limitations isn't something Scottish politicans have ever done particulary well.

That last comment is pretty special, as if Scottish people are inherently incapable of managing there own affairs.

&gt;Along the same lines, I'm not sure what keeping Scotland in its place really means.

&gt;-Personally though I wouldn't so optimisitc about your future...

&gt;-if you think the 5 million people in Scotland with a fledgling government are going to dictate the terms of independence to the well established government in westminster, representing the other 55 million people - you are mistaken. If you vote for it, I've no doubt you'll get independence... as far as everything else goes, don't be so sure.
 
&gt;-if anything you might see the economic policies coming out of the City of London being even more fiscally aggressive, since they don't need to 'hold back' for the sake of Edinburgh or Glasgow.

&gt;-The biggest threat to the Scots are themselves, not the English. I think deep down a lot of people realise this - which is perhaps why they have such a cultural inferiority cringe.

&gt;-This whole independence debate can be summed up with the old adage: You don't know what you've got till it's gone.

&gt;-Scotland is a small nation and if independent will be constrained by that, in ways which people haven't considered.

I'd be content with Scotland being like our neighbours Denmark or Norway, I'm not sure what constraint their size places on them that affects their quality of life, fair society and prosperity. They set a beautiful example for Scotland's future.

Look, let's agree to disagree. You've coloured the debate but not come close to making me change my mind.

true,stop___grammar_time,tardis,TARDIS,"I love the First Doctor's control room. I like the whole rocket-age retrofuturistic feel of the whole thing - the cold sterile white of it all, the hard geometric shapes, the hexagonal ceiling thing with the circles, the huge banks of computers - the whole thing is fantastic. Then there's the odd bits of terrestrial furniture that clash with the whole thing and really humanizes the space. 

The Eighth Doctor's console room is great also. It's this humongous sort of gothic, cathedral ceilinged library space with shelves of books and all sorts of souvenirs and artifacts and furniture strewn about. And oh by the way, there's a Tardis console in the middle. It's dark and looming and mysterious and so vastly different from the mostly sterile white of its predecessors.

I think Eleven's console rooms really fit him. His first console room felt warm and alive, and felt whimsical and *alive* and womb-like with its asymmetry and sort of cobbled-together looking console. I thought that really fit with his personality and outlook during his time with the Ponds.

##Series 7b spoilers below


I like the new one too, but I really like how they used the change and design as a storytelling device in itself. The last time we see the orange control room and the Doctor that goes with it is when he loses the Ponds, which *devastates* the Doctor.  When we see him next in the Christmas episode, he's nothing like the Doctor we knew. He's grouchy and angry and sort of uptight and it's clear that he's been that way for a while. No more tweed jacket bow tie, he's wearing this dark, sort of Edwardian, (appropriately) Scrooge-ish outfit. 

And then the big reveal happens - I like to believe that our (and Clara's) first glance is as the Doctor begins to see it at that moment. It's a thing of wonder, flashing with carnival lights. The expression on the Doctor's face says it all; it seems like the first time in a long time that he's actually been excited and happy to be in the Tardis.

On the actual design, it's great. It touches on the retrofuturistic, which I think is perfect for the anniversary year. While not white, the pale grey and cold lights evokes the same sort of sterile, sci-fi technological feel that the old ones had.

9/10's was my least liked from the new series. Despite apparently being the smallest set of the three, it felt abandoned and empty and derelict. It never felt alive - if 11's first console felt like a womb, 9/10's felt like a hollowed out corpse.

Spurs forward players keeping their width will be crucial because Spurs fullbacks may not be able to push on as much as normal since they will be facing a front three and will have to be more conservative going forward.

If Spurs play 4-3-3 it will essentially force Wigan into more of a 4-3-3 shape themselves because if their wingers are pushed back one of their centerbacks will step into midfield(they won't mark Defoe with three men).

She was one prospective councillor out of over a  thousand being fielded by UKIP alone, virtually anybody that belongs and is active in a community can become a prospective councillor.  Journalists following Nigel Farage on his recent Common Sense Tour noted that if, when at a local meet up, the leader was asked an in depth question by someone in the audience he would often suggest that they should become a UKIP councillor candidate.  In many ways it's a thankless task.  In this case a candidate embarrassed herself, another side to her has come out, and the conspiracy theories have ruled her out as being suitable.  24hrs later and she's gone.  

Only a couple of days ago the UKIP leader was saying that it was incredibly difficult to vet all councillors there's so many, for any party, and some people might inevitably slip the net, whoever you are.  That if they find a bad apple they'll deal with it accordingly.  Regrettable, but there needs to be a little perspective.

Last week there was a pensioner running for council in Boscastle for UKIP.  It transpired that she'd previously been a member of the BNP for 6 months before realising what they stood for and leaving (she claimed).  UKIPs policy is clear: she was shown the door, and it's already last week's news.

When you're talking of literally thousands of councillors, where there is no real qualification or life-experience requirement, vetting begins to rely on what information prospective candidates volunteer.

You've just brought back a memory for me, I used to volunteer at a charity shop and they had an Opeth DVD donated, we were allowed to take things we fancied and I bookmarked it as soon as I saw it but then the manager and I had a set-to so I stormed out and never went back; totally forgetting the DVD. -.-

I dunno if you're a fan of Porcupine Tree or not, but the main-bloke in that called Steven Wilson is a good friend of Mikael Åkerfeldt and they've worked together on a handful of PT and Opeth songs and I think Steven Wilson produced Blackwater Park; so it may be worth checking them out, along with a group called Storm Corrosion which is just Åkerfeldt and Wilson. My understanding of SC is that it's not music in the same vein that the two members are known for, it's more a chance for them to stretch their musical legs a bit into territories which they couldn't in the other bands.

true,strolls,null,null,"Every manifesto is based on the assumption that the party is going to have a complete majority. This is the first hung parliament in 4 decades, not the standard.

I guess you're right, that this is a reflection upon your youth - Blair promised an AV referendum in every manifesto he made. The labour party was elected three times on that promise, and they broke it every time. And they had a majority. This is only the most recent broken election promises, that I remember.

Some of us have been voting Lib-Dem for years. I don't think I've ever voted for any other party, because the priority for me is a more democratic electoral system. I think our democracy is broken, and I've always voted Lib-Dem because their need for electoral reform aligns with my desires for a fairer system.

So if Clegg had a choice when the coalition was formed, who would you rather he betrayed? You or the guys that have been voting Lib-Dem for decades?

I think that maybe Clegg could have handled it better. Maybe he could have said, ""stuff it, we need the queen to dissolve parliament and we need to hold another general election, because the Tories won't agree to both an AV referendum and no tuition fees"". Maybe he should have demanded everyone go back to the polls and maybe, after the necessary few months of uncertainty, he would have got a majority this time.

Clegg screwed up. It will cost him and his party politically - they'll lose votes next time, and he'll have to stand down as leader. But Clegg bet his shirt on the AV referendum, which would have given us a fairer democracy. He didn't imagine, I guess, that people would turn down a demonstrably more democratic voting system in favour of first-past-the-post, which is long-established as broken. Had everyone voted AV, he could have demanded a repeal of tuition fees down the line, or other measures to reduce wealth inequality.

true,cptjmshook,null,null,"&gt; Keep in mind that it is not possible to cross one's own timeline.    
    
This could easily be explained by an addendum to the rule stipulating that as long as one has no memory of the events one is visiting, one can cross one's own timeline. Also, in ""The Other Doctor"" Ten met someone whom he believed at first to be a future regeneration of himself and seemed completely untroubled by the prospect. So clearly the rule is more of a guideline.   
   
&gt; Now we know from The Impossible Astronaut that River and future Doctor will have done all the things together, increasing the possibility of them being different people.    
    
I don't see how that obviates the possibility that they're two different incarnations of the same person. This is science-fiction, after all. Stranger things have happened.    
    
&gt; Further, we do not know the principle of changing genders nor do we know that it can be a regular occurrence.    
    
As I said in my original post, in ""The Doctor's Wife"" the Doctor refers to another Time Lord, the Corsair, having been both male and female in various incarnations, establishing that a regeneration can result in a sex change. So clearly it's possible. And it doesn't matter if it occurs regularly.

More information: Gladstone received a state funeral due to the vast public sympathy and outcry for one on his death. In his will he stated that he wanted his funeral to be 'very simple and also private unless they [his executors] shall consider that there are conclusive reasons to the contrary'. His son told the sitting Conservative Prime Minister Lord Salisbury that in his families opinion public reaction to his death constituted that conclusive reason. It's also worth noting that the address calling on the Queen  for a public funeral and memorial in Westminster Abbey was approved by both Houses.

true,cptjmshook,null,null,"&gt; I would say no to this because personally I don't like it. But at the same time, it can be debunked with one line that The Doctor said in multiple occasions, the fact that when another Time Lord is around, he can sense them. If Time Lords can sense their race, then 10/11 would immediately know that River is a Time Lord.    
    
Yes, but clearly that Time Lord detecting sixth sense isn't always reliable. After all, in ""The Other Doctor"" Ten thought for a good half the episode that he had met a future regeneration of himself, and didn't learn until later that he was actually a delusional human. If his sixth sense was foolproof, wouldn't he have known right away that the other Doctor was not actually another Doctor?    
    
&gt; Not to mention that River changes professions constantly. She has at least multiple doctorites.    
    
Yes, but they make a **very big deal** out of the fact that she's a doctor.    
    
&gt; Secondly, if River is in fact the Doctor, why is she in jail throughout all of the series?    
    
Because in the Doctor's/River's timeline, all of that (her time in jail) took place *before* her adventures as the Doctor.    
    
&gt; My thought is that River is still subconcously (sp?) controlled by the Silents to kill the Doctor. The Silents were in cohorts with the Greater Intelligence in order to keep their plot in her subconcious (sorry, i suck at spelling). So in order to keep the Doctor save, she is not able to remain a companion because the GI or Silents will find out and they will flip her switch so that they can finally be rid of their greatest enemy. Hence her locked up in prison, it's not to punish her so much as it is to keep her from doing what they ""raised"" her to do.

They're also essentially a single-issue party. Their sole aim is to get out of the EU. A lot of their policies are dependent on this alone.

However, if you get the time the Lake District (on the western end of the border) is stunning. There's a series of very detailed mountain guides by Alfred Wainwright that are works of art.

Yes, we do have mountains, very small ones in England, but perfectly formed. There are plenty of campsites - I recommend the National Trust run site in Great Langdale, in the heart of the fells (hills). Google image search ""langdale"", ""Wasdale"" ""lake district"" etc. Stunning place, best seen in the summer/early autumn.

In North Wales the mountains are a bit wilder, in Scotland they are sensational. The Scots countryside has a serious problem with midges (small mosquitoes) in the summer.

You may get a better feel for British life in the smaller towns where people are friendlier and they have more time.

Akerfeldt is a brilliant front man.

The two albums I mentioned were released earlier than Blackwater Park (1997/1999 I think) and show their transition from the really black metal of their early years to the more melodic stuff.

I'm not a huge fan of their latest album which is really proggy, it's supposed to be a grower though.  Porcupine Tree influence very apparent.

The first half of the article there takes the same tone as this one, then it gets to the details.

It seems like Miss Maddocks lives abroad and when her father had a fall the council took steps to put him in a home. The article implies that an order of care is standard procedure in such cases, so that they have authority to act on behalf of their infirm charges.

From the Mail's article:

&gt; *Judge Cardinal said in his ruling that …  Miss Maddocks knew she had been ordered not to interfere with her father [and that] she had done so on a number of occasions.* … 

&gt; *The judge recorded that she also gave her father a wooden cross ‘to prevent the evil in the home from hurting him’.*

&gt; *Miss Maddocks also ‘produced and distributed a leaflet prior to and during the final hearing giving details of the case, containing a photograph of her father and other information so as to identify him and that is in breach of Court of Protection rules.’*

&gt; *Miss Maddocks was said to have left a long and abusive message on a social worker’s voicemail describing ‘you in your tarty little stuck up voice’ and to have called council staff names including ‘arrogant little cunning b*******’.*

&gt; *In one message she said: ‘I hope you all end up where my Dad is and I hope you all end up cursed.’
Judge Cardinal said she had ‘the attitude of someone who is simply not going to obey court orders’.*

    DOCTOR: Nothing. It's nothing. A book, an old story for old people. Now where to next? The Shimmering
    Lakes of Pandatorea are lovely this time of year. Well, I say 'time' -

    CLARA: I've watched a god die, brought a ghost back to life from another dimension, and got stuck
    in the heart of a time machine and I have *no* idea who you even are. 

    DOCTOR: Who I am isn't important.

    CLARA: Doctor, who are you? Where are you from? And why are you running away?

*The Doctor looks at the book ponderously.*

    DOCTOR: ...I've lived a very long time, long enough to see the world turn, and friends die, and empires
    crumble. I have seen good men go to war and I have seen civilizations erased. I've lived a very long
    time, but I know I won't live forever. I'm the Doctor. I'm the last Time Lord, the only survivor, and I
    wrote this so that the universe would remember why I died alone.

I have ample reason to despise them.  

Namely: 

1) They move into a town that already has a great Mom and Pop shop.  Then they run non-stop specials until the Mom and Pops are closed.  Then they stop the specials and ""new releases"" (much of which are 5 years old) are now $5.

2) They require, *require*, a credit card.  Understand that they cater primarily to lower income families.  Now, in order for a lower income family to rent a movie, they *must* have a credit card - something they probably should not have.  (Mind that I do not have a credit card that they would accept.  I have an American Express.  So I had to always borrow someone else's account.)

3) They engage in a huge list of anti-competitive practices to prevent consumers from being able to simply *buy* films at the store.  Further, they would get involved in shenanigans such that they were the exclusive place to see the movie for 6 months upon release, then the exclusive place to purchase the movie for several months, all whilst charging as much for renting as Wal-Mart would to buy it, then 4 times that amount to buy it.

true,PeelianPl3b,null,null,"It depends on the situation. However you have the right to be treated with dignity and respect as far as possible. The more you extend to the officer the more they can extend to you. 

 If you're stopped driving a motor vehicle on a road then the officer may do that and may inspect your documents. In general help the officer out and they'll help you out. If I tell someone to get their hands out of their pockets and show me their hands and they don't, I start getting worried. If an officer asks you to do this they're asking because they're worried about their safety. Now you might be Mister Law abiding from 123 I'm a reasonable chap road, amiable town but the officer does not know that. When they do things for their personal safety it is not a personal slur on your character. The problem a police officer has is we do not know who will present a threat to our safety and who will not. 


A police officer may signal you to stop by means of a hand gesture or by means of flashing lights and siren if in a vehicle. 

If it is for the purposes of a stop and search the officer must tell you the grounds of the search, the object (which is usually obvious from the grounds) show you their warrant card if they are in plain clothes, tell you their name and their station, tell you that you're entitled to a copy of the record of the search and that you are detained for the purposes of the search. You don't have to give the officer your name or address however at the same time if you do not take the slip or the officer is required elsewhere then it will be much harder to find your slip at a later time. There are no negative repercussions to having been stopped and searched if nothing is found on you in any case and it won't effect CRBs or anything like that. There are some situations where a constable can require your name and address. These times include if you are the driver of a vehicle, if you are believed to be behaving in an anti-social manner, if you are believed to be drinking in a designated no drinking zone. Note the above does not apply if the search is made post arrest, the officer need only have reason to believe that you may have dangerous articles, implements for escape or evidence of an offence on you. 

You may have a copy of the stop record and this takes some time to produce. The officer may be urgently required elsewhere and may have to write the slip up later in which case you can pick the stop slip up from either that officer's police station or one which is on that policing sector. You have three months to pick it up. Even if you opt not to take it at the time. With regard to Section 60 criminal justice and police act searches the police don't need to have grounds to search you, just that you are in an area that has been designated. This is usually done when there is a football match where tensions are expected or where gang tensions are heightened in a given area. 

With regard to stop and account there is nothing to stop the officer asking you questions. You don't have to answer them. They are asking you to account for your actions or presence in an area. If you can provide an explanation then that is usually best for both parties. Usually when police are doing this its because a crime has recently taken place. If you can say I'm John Smith I live just down the street and am returning home or whatever then the police can move on much more quickly and try and catch the suspect. 

In the case of a stop and search, arrest or if you try to attack the officer in any way they have every right to use reasonable force to defend themselves of effect the stop and search or arrest. 

On the front of filming, yes you can film police in public. However the catch is should you capture evidence of an offence on your mobile phone the officer has a right to seize your phone as evidence. If you are not involved in an incident and feel the need to watch or record do not get too close. If you get close you worry the officer and you often end up winding up other people who are involved. This makes our job much harder. If you start coming over waving a phone around I immediately have to think that you're trying to ""help"" the suspect and may try to hand him a weapon, the phone may be a disguised stun gun or pepper spray cannister, a lot of possibilities start to go through my head and the officer retains the right to use reasonable force, even pre-emptively if they feel they need too.

That's completely uncontroversial inasmuch as that works for Halifax, say. Wales was not a party to the 1707 Act of Union, it didn't exist as a state or separate kingdom. The area we call Wales was just England.

The Laws in Wales Act 1535 didn't create the annexation the conquest and fealty of the various peoples in the region did: ""[the] Country of Wales justly and righteously *is* [...] annexed"". Not ""is now"" or ""will be"". This is readily confirmed by looking for example at [Section I(4)](http://owain.vaughan.com/1535c26/#section1 ""LiW 1535"") wherein the King bitches about ""rude and ignorant people"" who seem to think that people in Wales aren't under his dominion so much as those in other parts of his Kingdom.

The Laws in Wales Act having ""no outstanding effect"" doesn't create a new state where there never was one before.

GK - Reina

RB - Johnson

RCB - Skrtel

LCB - Agger

LB - Enrique

RCM - Gerrard

LCM - Lucas

CAM - Coutinho

RW - Farfan (Schalke)

ST - Suarez

LW - Sturridge

Like I said, the wingers are inside forwards, so they're pushed in as much as they can be while retaining the winger designation. It works brilliantly; I'm in February, and Suarez had 23 goals, Sturridge 12, and Farfan 8.

Subs: Aranzubia (Deportivo La Coruna), Kelly, Carragher, Allen, Guarin (Porto), Kuyt (I usually keep player transfers up to date, but Fenerbahce aren't in 12), Zarate (Lazio; he rotates with Farfan / Sturridge and has 10 goals)

Notable Reserves: Vertonghen, Bassong, Kadlec (leaving in the summer, he can't advance the attack at all), Henderson (rotates with Allen / Guarin), Shelvey, Borini (I love him, but I can't seem to score with him, so he'll be leaving in the summer while his value is still high), Assaidi, Downing.

Gerrard has started to decline, so I'm lining up a move for Marchisio in the summer.

UKIP supporters or UKIP head office, and were they actually reading?  I looked before the page was pulled.  I didn't see anything to suggest party central had prior knowledge - and they certainly moved fast to remove her once it became clear they had been made aware.  

They're fielding around 1,500 councillors - they're not reading their Tweets - they made the point days ago that they're reliant on others helping them expose potential problems and nipping it in the bud.   That in itself is part of the problem; they're coming up on the rails so fast they don't yet have the same internal infrastructure of the other parties, or as long to establish candidates.  They've more than doubled the field in the last year alone.  It's an admitted administrative issue.


&gt;Are you seriously going to suggest that I said anything like this? 

You did.  You said they were perfectly happy with this candidate until the press got wind.  You really think they're going to wait until she's potentially elected and when she certainly will have more local press attention, and then suspend her?  No, as they said before this situation even became known.  They actively want to prevent it.

No, probably not, but they do have a much more zero tolerance than other parties when they do find them.  Importantly this wasn't anti-Semitism as such more really, really weird conspiracy theorists surrounding a Jewish bank and Zionists.  She was actually blaming them for harming Jewish people, differentiated between Zionism and Judaism, and their planning the holocaust.  Which is more than bad enough with even the crazy aspect aside.  That's one hell of a criminal allegation and deeply offensive.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"&gt; I think an independent Scotland would be culturally reduced to little more than a pathetic pastiche of itself.

I think this has been misconstrued as a critisicism of Scots culture, which it certainly isn't (but I can see how it reads that way)... what I meant is that 'real' Scottish culture has more to be proud of than what I think independence will reduce it to. At the end of the day, Scotland helped forge the modern world which is extraordinary really when you consider how small a nation it is. I bet just about every school child in the world knows who the Scottish people are and where that is... could you say the same for other similarly sized nations like Lithuania or Georgia? What about all those famous Lithuanian and Georgian scientists, mathematicians and engineers?... with all respect to them, I'm not even sure I could point those nations out on a map.

&gt; I'd be content with Scotland being like our neighbours Denmark or Norway

Christ, who wouldn't - they score highest on just about every measure of quality of life, and have the 3rd and 8th highest GDP per capita of anywhere in the world. Saying you'd be content with being like Norway is rather like sitting in Wester Hailes and saying you'd be content if you could live in Murrayfield.... well d'uh, who wouldn't want to be the richest happiest people on the planet?

But Scotland isn't Norway or Denmark - and being independent isn't going to make that happen, contrary to what the SNP would have us believe. First of all they have oil wealth beyond what Scotland has - and secondly, an independent Scotland won't even have full possession of it's oil... because it's a joint asset. It's rather like winning the lottery and getting divorced the next day - But at the end of the day, those winnings are joint and will have to be split fairly. This is even more true when you consider that whilst the oil is geographically proximal to Scotland, the industry was developed using capital raised in London. Look at it this way, there is only so much money, and if Scotland took a bigger share of that then what do you think would happen to the rest of the UK?

Add to that mix the volatility of oil prices and Scotlands other liabilities and I think the end result will be a nation roughly with the same amout of cash as they currently have.

I really urge you to consider the benefits of voting no, then subsequently for maximum devolution... even if you ultimately do feel that independence is the only answer, then devo-max would make sense as a logical and safe stepping stone. It would also provide more time to build up and seperate the literally hundreds (if not thousands) of joint institutions.

Its made clear that that is what I want you to do but without being rude about it. It will usually be phrased ""Just take you hands out of your pockets for me please and show me you've got nothing in your hands."" The reason I need to be firm about it is because I don't want there to be a grey area and I don't want to get into a conversation about it. I want it to be done fairly quickly. The reason we want people to do this is usually because we're worried they may have something on them which is going to harm us, another or indeed their own person. People will be thanked for doing it. If you're a police officer you're always thinking about your personal safety. Any situation you find yourself in can turn from peaceful to confrontational in the blink of an eye with no apparent rhyme or reason. You've got to have the mind set that any person could attack you. Ever do that thing where you're standing around in a queue at the supermarket and you make a mental plan of what you would do if everyone in the room decided they wanted to fight. As a police officer you think that all the time and you make your plan realistic because it might happen. If your in a situation where people know you're a police officer (outside of say your friends and family) you've got to be on your guard. Its the hands that kill as they say. If someone stalls on that point and doesn't show me their hands then I start to consider using tactical options.

They'd be able to say nothing other than excuse me all day if you're part of a large crowd. Also there are times when you're aiming to slow people down to avoid a crush and things like that. At football and rugby events the main priority is crowd management. It's not always pleasant but it is necessary.

They've said they couldn't thoroughly vet all 1,700 prospective councillors.  They actually went to the media and warned as much before this flared up and said as much.  They said if something gets through the net then tell us.   That if someone isn't being honest with us or completely open, then it would be difficult to impose the zero tolerance policy they have which other main parties do not.

The crazy was jumping off the page.  I agree.  But there's nothing to say they saw the page.  She didn't even use her proper name as a handle.

&gt;He said there may be ""one or two"" council candidates that Ukip would not be happy with, but said it was not possible for the party to vet all 1,700 in time.

A tranche was a slice/share of a bundled group of these loans. This muddied the waters as to who actually owned a lot of these properties and caused more forecloses. German banks bought tons of these investments, reasoning that American real estate had never gone down in recent history not taking into account how inflated much of the prices were.

American banks like the wall street arm of HSBC and Bank of America sold bad investments. The American banks aren't as regulated as German banks. German banks bought up these investments like hotcakes but also some had to know it was too good to be true.

true,NeoMegaRyuMKII,tennant,Tennant,"&gt; This could easily be explained by an addendum to the rule stipulating that as long as one has no memory of the events one is visiting, one can cross one's own timeline.

If River IS a future Doctor then she would have memory of the time crossing therefore eliminating that addendum as an excuse.

&gt;  Also, in ""The Other Doctor"" Ten met someone whom he believed at first to be a future regeneration of himself and seemed completely untroubled by the prospect. So clearly the rule is more of a guideline. 

10 believed it somewhat, but it turned out that it was not the case and therefore would not break the ""do not cross your own timeline"" rule

&gt; I don't see how that obviates the possibility that they're two different incarnations of the same person. This is science-fiction, after all. Stranger things have happened. 

Several reasons. First, the book of their records would have to be the same object at two different timelines which we learned during The Big Bang is not exactly a good thing. Further, the older Doctor at that time knew who River was and basically everything else about her. Since at the time he knew he would be shot (and later so would River) it would create a sort of killing-your-ancestor paradox. This is different from the one in The Unquiet Dead (Eccleston's 3rd episode) since it is not a fixed point death. If the Doctor was supposed to die before turning into River then River could not exist.

&gt; As I said in my original post, in ""The Doctor's Wife"" the Doctor refers to another Time Lord, the Corsair, having been both male and female in various incarnations, establishing that a regeneration can result in a sex change.

The pound is strong against the dollar - it's $1.6 to the pound at the moment, I believe, and we tend to have the same ""number"" as a price for most things.  ie a $4 beer will be 4 quid.  Can't speak for student discounts or offers, though.

Travel to mainland Europe is best done by air.  EDI has a decent amount of connections, but some will go through Heathrow.  RyanAir &amp; EasyJet do cheap, no-thrills tickets to a lot of destinations.  Then there's InterRailing, but you'll definitely have to go via London for that (about 5 hours on the east coast line).

Plenty of gig locations, but all relatively small scale (which I prefer).  Edinburgh doesn't have any decent size arenas - for the ""names"" you'll have to go to Glasgow and the SECC, Barrowlands or even QMU. Occasionally people will play the Playhouse or Usher Hall, but they're more musical/theatre oriented.

The Liquid Rooms tends to get some decent names in (and the monthly 90s indie night - Madchester - is fantastic if you like that era), and then there are plenty of smaller venues for covers, indie, rock, folk, local bands etc like Drop Kick Murphy's, Whistlebinkies &amp; Bannermans.  Add to that a shedload of pubs that have smaller bands regularly, like Henry's, Lebowskis etc and there's pretty much always something on.  

Edit - forgot the Corn Exchange out in Gorgie/Slateford.  About 10 minutes by train from Waverley - they've had some big names in the past.  Manics and Prodigy are two that spring to mind.

Nightlife is fairly varied - flat parties do of course make an appearance but there's a lot of bars, pubs, nightclubs, and things in between. It's less than an hour on the train to get to Glasgow too so going out there is also possible. [Wearing a full steampunk outfit is inadvisable though](http://i.imgur.com/SUjI0cn.jpg) - far too warm!

Oh and costume parties happened a lot when I was in uni too (I graduated in 2011).

Edinburgh has at least four universities (Edinburgh, Heriot-Watt, Edinburgh Napier, Queen Margaret) if not more (depending on what we count the many other institutions for higher education as). As a result there's a lot of students and things catering to them - you'll have a blast.

&gt;How is travel to the rest of Europe?

If you book far enough in advance it can be quite affordable. Edinburgh has an airport that's easily accessible by bus and there's two train stations that'll take you throughout the UK if you don't feel like venturing abroad. It's probably cheaper to fly than take the train lots of the time. It's about the same price for me to fly down to my folks in Wales, for example, but generally a take the train to minimise hassle.

&gt;Places to see good music?

Really depends on what you like. There's several venues fairly centrally and there's also Glasgow. I generally had more fun at gigs in Glasgow (better sound engineering, for example). I can't really give specifics without knowing what sort of thing you consider good music.

true,KaiserMacCleg,,,"&gt; *The Laws in Wales Act 1535 didn't create the annexation the conquest and fealty of the various peoples in the region did*

You are very confused on the meaning of the word ""annexation"". Annexation ≠ conquest. A modern day example would be the Palestinian territories - the West Bank and Gaza Strip. They were, along with the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights, captured by the Israelies during the Six-Day War of 1967. The Sinai Peninsula was subsequently returned to Egypt. The other territories have since been under the military occupation of Israel but have never been annexed. They remain legally and constitutionally distinct from Israel proper, and the international community recognises them as such.

The conquest of Wales 1283 is analogous to the conquest of the Palestinian territories in 1967. Between 1283 and 1535, Wales was a legal no-man's land; a patchwork of semi-independent lordships and crown territories, in which Welsh law continued to be used under certain circumstances. What came about in 1535 was Wales' ""one state solution"" - the incorporation into the Kingdom of England. 

&gt;*This is readily confirmed by looking for example at Section I(4)*

 Try reading just a little bit further, to section I(5):

""*his said Country or Dominion of Wales shall be, stand and continue for ever from henceforth incorporated, united and annexed to and with this his Realm of England;*""

I(4) is Harri's problem. I(5) is his solution.

&gt;*The Laws in Wales Act having ""no outstanding effect"" doesn't create a new state where there never was one before.*

I have never argued that that was the case.",0,1366937365,null,0,false,0,c9mrji1,t3_1cpfud,t1_c9mrji1,t1_c9mpotv,null,1431426572,1,false,Wales,t5_2qhrl,1

Day 4 - Mod 1 test

Day 5 - Mod 2 test. 

Personally I had a really enjoyable week and passed both tests without any minors in either as I'd had experience on a 125 for a year previously - it really depends on your skill level. My instructors assessed me before I did the course and deemed me competent enough for the short course - but it's not recommended as it puts you under A LOT of pressure. 

If you were to do a 5 day course, you would need to pass your Mod 1 test for definite or else you're not able to take your Mod 2 test the day after. If you were to fail Mod 1, you would not be able to cancel your Mod 2 so will lose the money for doing so and have to re-book it at a later date. You also need to have passed your theory prior to this - some riding courses include this in the fee. 

Although it may seem expensive (the course I did was £575 all in, including insurance, fuel, bike hire and all tests except the theory), a proper all-in instructor-lead course is the best way IMO if you want to pass quickly. The instructors will give you guidance on not just how to pass, but also how to ride safely and be confident on the bike plus they'll show you the test routes too. 

You don't need to apply for anything before doing so, your licence will be updated if/when you pass. 

Again let me re-iterate, it's entirely down to your skill and confidence level. If you've ridden bikes before, you'll be fine - if you have never ridden a motorcycle and can't ride a bicycle then forget about it, there's simply too much to learn in such a short period of time. Find a local course, give them a ring and they'll clear things up for you.",0,1366938213,null,0,false,0,c9mruz0,t3_1btphr,t1_c9mruz0,t3_1btphr,null,1431426422,3,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,3

true,cptjmshook,null,null,"&gt; If River IS a future Doctor then she would have memory of the time crossing therefore eliminating that addendum as an excuse.   
   
No, no. I'm not saying River is a *future* Doctor. I'm saying she's who the Doctor was before he *became* the Doctor!    
    
&gt; 10 believed it somewhat, but it turned out that it was not the case and therefore would not break the ""do not cross your own timeline"" rule   
   
Yes, I know it turned out not to be the case, but the Doctor, out of whose very mouth we heard the rule ""Don't cross your own timeline,"" didn't seem all that concerned when he thought it *was*. Therefore one could extrapolate from Ten's utter lack of concern -- indeed, his delight -- at meeting a future incarnation of himself, that's it's not really all that big a deal.    
    
&gt; Several reasons. First, the book of their records would have to be the same object at two different timelines which we learned during The Big Bang is not exactly a good thing. Further, the older Doctor at that time knew who River was and basically everything else about her. Since at the time he knew he would be shot (and later so would River) it would create a sort of killing-your-ancestor paradox.    
    
Yes, but neither of them *actually winds up dead*.    
    
&gt; I know that it was established that it COULD happen But as far as we know it was a very special circumstance or even an isolated occurrence. It could theoretically happen to the Doctor as well but at this point there is no reason to believe that gender switch is a normal occurrence.

&gt; Yes, I know it turned out not to be the case, but the Doctor, out of whose very mouth we heard the rule ""Don't cross your own timeline,"" didn't seem all that concerned when he thought it was. Therefore one could extrapolate from Ten's utter lack of concern -- indeed, his delight -- at meeting a future incarnation of himself, that's it's not really all that big a deal. 

I do not necessarily know if I believe that he did not believe. He knew the ""fake"" doctor believed and perhaps it would be damaging to tell him that he is not

&gt; Yes, but neither of them actually winds up dead. 

That is only because the Doctor changed time so that he would not be dead yet make it seem as though he is. If they had been the same person then River would have been affected by the initial killing.

Very good. But the counties of Wales who'd held out and who's lords newly came under the overlordship of the English King didn't remain distinct any more so than Essex or Northumbria did when they were subsumed in to the lands of Wessex. There was no Wales as we see it now, just a group of newly conquered counties that the King had subsumed into his dominion.

In the Palestinian situation there are separate internationally recognised states vying for ownership of the land, this was not the case here. Arguably the only reason Israel haven't annexed all the areas they have at any time occupied is international pressure, they did annex East Jerusalem. But I confess I stay almost purposefully ignorant of the state of play with the ""occupied territories"".

Section I(5) affirms that the King's dominion of Wales will *continue* to be annexed in perpetuity. Nullifying that statement doesn't make it no longer annexed it just says there's no act of law that says it will continue to be incorporated within. If you wish then to disincorporate - as it were - some counties then you'd need to take some action to accomplish that beyond mere cessation of the effect of this act of law.

Just listen to how convoluted that synopsis is. That's how Steven Moffat writes. So it's hardly outside the realm of possibility that he will write an equally convoluted excuse for why River was not affected by the Doctor's initial death.

I did, but here is the thing: this argument has gone circular meaning that it cannot be critically valid

&gt; Nah, he seemed pretty fuckin' tickled about meeting his future self, and asked all sorts of questions about his style, his fashion sense, his methodology, his companion, etc. If he had known from the start, then we wouldn't have gotten those looks of mounting suspicion leading up to the reveal. 

SEEMED being the key word. Or perhaps the Doctor WANTED to believe

&gt; Just listen to how convoluted that synopsis is. That's how Steven Moffat writes. So it's hardly outside the realm of possibility that he will write an equally convoluted excuse for why River was not affected by the Doctor's initial death. Wait, actually, it's not convoluted at all. She's his past self, not his future self, and what happens to one's future self has no effect on one's past self whatsoever. See? Easy. 

I am not saying it is impossible for River to be the past/future Doctor. I am explaining why I think that is not the case.

Maybe... but if she is his past how would she have memories of becoming the Doctor we know?

&gt; Yes, but sometimes you can just tell when a throwaway line is actually going to be important later on. At least I can. Maybe it's because I'm a writer myself. And as soon as the Doctor said that line about Corsair having been both a man and a woman, I knew it would be important down the road. Whether that's because River Song will turn out to be the Doctor or because Moffat plans on making the next regeneration of the Doctor a woman remains to be seen.

I have heard of the idea of making the Doctor a woman (though it was a planned holiday special in which it occurred because he caught a cold or the like - which may be part of the process for the Corsair).

I agree with what Lokian said, in that this episode made me not like 11 for a while. I really didn't like him in series 5 at all. It took a long time for him to grow on me.

true,MarcusOrlyius,null,null,"&gt;Unfortunately there is no better system for a country with millions of people. 

Yes there is, it's called socialism. It's a system where the vast majority of the population would be far better off because they're workers rather than owners of the means of production.

Under Capitalism:

Company A is owned by Mr A and produces goods. Mr A makes £1 million a year in profit (after paying taxes costs, R&amp;D, etc) and employs 5 machine operators @ £10 per hour and 1 manager @ £15 per hour. Each worker works 40 hours per week. The machine operators each make £20,800 per year and the manager makes £31,200 per year.

Under Socialism:

Company A is run by the workers and produces goods. Company A makes £1 million a year in profit (after paying taxes costs, R&amp;D, etc). That profit is divided between the workers. There are 5 machine operators and 1 manager. Each worker works 40 hours per week. The 5 machine operators each make £160,000 per year and the manager makes £200,000 per year.

It's pretty obvious which system is better for the vast majority of people.

He was rewarded for his success but it cost him dear on other more profound levels.

Did you take any photos in the first week? If so, dig em out. Clean the flat up to the same standard and you should be fine. Fill any drill holes and re-paint any damaged walls....clean that shit up. 

Yes landlords need to give you notice before entering but it doesn't stop them looking through your window. If you've got a letter, then it's probably more an interest of public health or you could be invalidating his insurance by leaving it in a dirty state. 

Landlords are never perfect, you have to be pro-active with them to get what you want most of the time, but just make sure you protect yourself.

The government is probably more efficient at running large scale enterprises.

The truth is though that we're walking towards something much more dangerous. Government funded private enterprise. When a government runs a service, their driving motivation is the service. With things such as railways or any of the services Serco or A4S now provide there's a conflict. These companies have no interest in providing the service, they have an interest in making profit. We all know full well, they make the profit from gouging the government, not providing the service. So we go from a slightly innefficient government, to the government being exploited.

Your real problem, IMO, is that Britain is a small island and everyone is crammed into cities.  There's simply too damned many people per square mile, driving the costs (and value) of land through the roof, which is highly exacerbated (for good or ill) by the government's rather heavy intervention in the land and housing markets (not to mention green spaces and the like).  The result is that a pub is perfectly profitable, but a grocery store might be more profitable, and so a grocery store can sign a more lucrative contract with the land owner (or buy the land outright).  You've also got a situation where corporations are allowed to own land (I highly disagree with this), meaning they can spread the costs out across their lifetimes (considerably longer than a would-be publican).  Even for leasing, the grocery store can comfortably sign a 99 year lease *with full intent to fulfill it*, whereas a publican is unlikely to live through such a lease, giving the corporation a huge edge in the department of giving the land lord stability.

As a post-grad at Nottingham this is a pretty interesting topic. We have a campus over there and, to my knowledge (which is admittedly second hand information because reading up on a Universities accounting practices is not my idea of a good Sunday morning) one of the UK campuses is largely funded by Chinese investment.

I don't have a problem with this in principle (so long as oppressive Chinese civil law doesn't come in to play) as I believe Science and Academia should cross political boundaries. At the same time, though, does it not make you uncomfortable that a foreign government sees the *obvious* benefit in investment in *our* education system (perhaps for somewhat imperialistic reasons) whilst our government thinks otherwise? They recently cut the education budget by 80% (and brought in higher loans) to, arguably, reduce the number of students and higher education institutions as well as reducing the science funding.

A few months ago a Nottingham Physics Professor, Philip Moriarty, even discussed the *literally* retarded changes to research council funding in the UK [in a video here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cFlaqEsyRg). Research grant applications should, apparently, show ""clear economic benefit"".

The only other thing I can think of is if you have no insurance and the vehicle is going to get seized. I wouldn't put it past our tow company to drag the car up the road with you still in it. If it is because you have kids in the car, then explain that. Usually a simple traffic matter doesn't take too long to deal with so depending on the age of the kids then it may be OK to leave them if the child lock is on but it's your call. If you know that you can't get out of the car then try to stop somewhere (firstly which is safe) and has a pavement or verge at the side of the road, that way the officer doesn't have to stand in the carriage way which is our primary concern. 

The reason we ask that people get out of their car and into ours is 1) it prevents us standing in the carriage way. Rubber neckers love a good old look when someone's been stopped, paperwork must be exciting stuff for them, you tend to drive towards what you're looking at and I've had a vehicle shunt mine before now due to rubber necking 2) we know there are no weapons and things in our car or out on the pavement. Our cars get searched at least three times a day with each new shift. 3) Its often quieter and the officer has access to all the equipment they need which really cuts down on time. I remember stopping someone, dealing with them, then finding out they were wanted for stabbing someone, upon arresting him I found an axe in the driver's door pocket. 

Personally I don't like having people in the back of my car, I think it puts me in a vulnerable position unless that person is handcuffed. So instead I like to have people out on the pavement.

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxford,"You make it sound like it was a surprise contract suddenly put onto them. The terms of the coalition were obviously negotiated beforehand. It wasn't a unilateral policy suddenly forced onto the lib dems.

The lib dems willingly gave up their election promise to pursue other compromises that they cared about more (I'm guessing the AV vote was one of them. Fat lot of good that did.).

I'm not saying it was an unavoidable compromise, afterall, they weren't technically elected to a majority. But they only got the chance to even be in the coalition because they got a lot of votes. Many who voted them to this point did so based on the tuition fees promise. When they dropped their election promise it showed that it was never their top priority in the first place.

They could have played hard and forced a different compromise, maybe forget AV in favour of lower tuition fees or something. I don't know what exactly but the Tories were certainly not in a position to dictate *all* the terms. Maybe join with labour or a group of others instead to get a different deal. It wouldn't be easy but so what?

The point is that they didn't. They knew it was a poisoned deal and they still took it. Why? From one point of view, it was because dear Nick wanted to be PM no matter the cost.

It's not the specific policy that is the issue. It's the principle that he gave up his promise.

That is why a lot of people won't trust him (and the party who stood by him) anymore.

He doesnt even mention the new Hillsborough inquest, in which 96 civilians of **this** fucking country died and were made to look like it was their own fault, one of the biggest cover-ups in history, but no that's not important, that's not setting a bad example to his precious little children is it?(whom he leaves in pubs and only realises when he gets home, something which would rightly get most parents in trouble with child protection services) 

Nope, the bad example is set by a Urugyuan footballer who has come over here and tried to poison our children with his antics, he purposely goes out to try and force our children to go around eating their friends. /s

I am absolutely flabbergasted that, on a day when the truth may actually start to come out, this repulsive, vile urchin of a man decides that the more pressing matter is - lets face it - a harmless idiotic bite. I hope Suarez does leave this country, for his own sake, because if I had the chance I'd be gone in a flash.

The professions in which this occurs are quite high paying, technical, and require a lot of training. It would be hugely expensive for the government to recruit sufficient numbers of people as ambitious and gifted as the best in the private sector, and then give them the same quality of training and a comparable salary.

You would ideally want the best people in a field with some commercial experience advising the government. Unfortunately, these people often work for prestigious private sector firms. How do you solve this? Massively increasing the public sector budget would do it, and would probably pay off for HMRC, but it would take a while to see the benefits and be very expensive.

""Ok, fine, I accept Suarez deserves more than a 10 game ban. He's obviously a little insane when in the heat of competition. The defenders that play against him never try to kick lumps out of him, they are interested in only the purest in footballing competition.

Remember the 10 game ban for Defoe biting Mascherano. Oh, strange that, it was laughed off in the press.

Remember the punishment for Gareth Bale diving all over the place. Hrm, for some reason no one ever says Bale shouldn't be in consideration for player of the year for being a cheat, but for Suarez....

I look forward to 20 game bans for leg snapping challenge after leg snapping challenge. Nah, they get 3 games at best, if even, next time Suarez, take your anger out like a good old fashioned englishman and go two studs to the kneecap as god intended it. Yes, it could end someone's career, but so could gnawing on their arm, many an athlete has fallen to a good chomp.

I remember fondly when Keane set out to end someone's career, did so, and then wrote about how this was his intention, and even more fondly remember his 20 game ban.

I remember fondly when Souness punched a player and broke his jaw, and took his 20 game ban, and I appreciate his silence and perspective on Suarez now.

I remember how Man United fans all rounded on Eric Cantona for kicking that lippy supporter, and everyone condemned him, and they sold him immediately. What he did was beyond the pale!

I don't even have to remember the horrible punishment doled out to Aguero for stamping last week, i mean, that could have really injured a player, so with a 10 game ban for biting, they must have really struggled to come up with an adequate punishment.

true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","It is, but it's very relevant if we're qualifying what 'living' consists of. 

On the one hand we have those arguing that it's possible to *live* on a bare minimum. They may be right but at the forfeit of any quality of life - another ambiguous term which means the difference between *just* having enough to afford your bills, food, rent etc. and being able to buy any personal luxury at all - from a pack of beer for a Friday night to a couple of weeks away in Italy. 

On the other hand there are those (including myself) who believe that whilst we're not *entitled* to a free ride, free holiday, free beer and so on - it's not unreasonable to expect to afford one or more of these things as part of a certain quality of life. The opposite option being a nation of shut-ins who cannot afford any entertainment, any advancement, anything at all more than the bare minimum to allow themselves to keep on living. That's a wholly depressing idea to me. 

I guess without defining a persons situation (whether they're on benefits, employed etc.) then it's impossible to say whether they should expect to include this quality of life in their expectations - if you're unemployed for instance then you might expect to forfeit that two week holiday in Italy until you can afford it via your job. 

But I'm entirely against the idea of testing exactly how little a person can live on as if it's some kind of challenge or target to beat - lest society in general start to turn around to those living in poverty and say 'well you have enough to live on, stop complaining'.",0,1366972585,null,0,false,0,c9n0dc3,t3_1d5739,t1_c9n0dc3,t1_c9n0bi5,null,1431422340,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

Then in the 19th century we started to see the rise of racial ""science"" and people began to create ""scientific"" reasons to hate Jews.

Also what the fuck does this have to do with him, and what does he stand to gain by pressuring the FA into giving him a longer ban?

Assuming her story is true (which it may not be) she was in a relationship with the guy and he raped her. Rape victims have been known to feel shame and guilt and the rapist often exacerbates this by pretending its a game or find a way to get them to that, deep down, it was their fault all along.

Schools in the area need to be expanded, travel links are congested to a much greater extent, Internet speeds are massively reduced, house prices for locals are reduced significantly, countryside is destroyed, you have years worth of trucks and tractors moving around. Considering the demand for social housing is greatest in the south east the green belt and building restrictions mean land is at a premium.

People keep saying 'build more houses' but it is not that simple. There is no real benefit to having houses built in your area so people will always oppose them as they barely ever get compensated with improved infrastructure. The land itself is massively expensive, people looking to build houses for those scummy landlords aren't sure if they can afford it, so it's going to cost the state masses. 

And even if we do create a massive amount of new housing which is cheap and easy it just means that even more people are going to want to move down south to London where the jobs are. This means demand will expand to where the supply curve is and we will never actually improve the situation. It will be people wanting to move down south who will get them, not people currently living in cities.

What the government is trying to do to deal with the issue is to expand transport links so that people can live outside the south east, where house building would be cheaper, but still work in the capital. Granted, this will take decades, but it should actually deal with the root causes of the problem without just a short term shifting out wards of the supply and demand curves.

Tl;dr, just building more houses wont actually solve the problem at its root.",0,1366975331,null,0,false,0,c9n0pxn,t3_1d5739,t1_c9n0pxn,t1_c9n017z,null,1431422175,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

The Nazis ""solved"" the problem by smashing up the working class organisations.  Their economic ""plan"", such as it was, was putting the economy on a war footing.

If you want an unvarnished proof of this, just compare the Eastern Front in World War I with that in World War II.

As for ""forcing people to co-operate"" - good grief.  You're basically defending the Stalinist line that they were only purging ""wreckers""!  On the contrary, the purges targeted the best elements of Soviet society, notoriously including its top scientists (physical and military).

The line that it ""always fails"" is also a distortion, and again covers up for the Stalinists.

The Orange Order has only published one book about itself, and considering there are new books on the subject being published every year many by whom who have their own agenda, a lot should be taken with a grain of salt.

I'll admit the atmospheres at some parades are not welcoming to Catholics, but most of these are band parades, (sometimes paramilitary and not Orange parades, (there is a difference). This of course varies around the Provence and around the world.

The Orange is not anti-catholic, but very pro-Protestantism and pro religious freedom for all, it is therefore opposed to Catholicism (the teachings of the church, but not the people) which has in the past been against religious freedom and which many believe to be teaching dogma contrary to basic biblical truths. The Order has no problem with Catholics, (individuals might be) in fact converts are allowed to join. In fact if the Orange Order was encouraging people to be anti Catholic, members who live in border areas and places with a low Protestant population would be severely disadvantaged in trying to conduct their business.

Given that the Orange order is a Christian organisation based on Protestant Reformed teaching, it doesn't permit people to join who do not accept the basic principles of the Protestant faith (The ""Take Five"" initiative by the Black institution has published some good literature on what those principles are.).

You cannot quantify doubt as a percentage, unless you are arguing on a very specific case wrt to a proven and specific probability e.g a mechanical or mathematical system.

reasonable doubt simply means ""reasonable doubt"" there is no specific criteria, what you are doing is applying what is called the ""base rate fallacy""

I don't wish to chastise you so publicly, but what you have actually done is counter to the entire justice system, by considering the likelihood of events in society as a requirement for level of innocence

&gt;***They also demonstrate how the SYP Police Federation, supported informally by the SYP 
Chief Constable, sought to develop and publicise a version of events that focused on 
several police officers’ allegations of drunkenness, ticketlessness and violence among a 
large number of Liverpool fans***. This extended beyond the media to Parliament.

&gt;Yet, from the mass of documents, television and CCTV coverage disclosed to the Panel 
**there is no evidence to support these allegations other than a few isolated examples of 
aggressive or verbally abusive behaviour clearly reflecting frustration and desperation**.

[**Chapter 12. Page 24**](http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/repository/report/HIP_report.pdf)

And theres more....

&gt;*At the meeting police officers repeated many of the allegations published in the 
media. The Chief Constable joined the meeting and advised that the SYP case had 
to be pulled together and given to the Inquiry. A ‘defence’ had to be prepared and 
a ‘rock solid story’ presented.* ***He believed that the Force would be ‘exonerated’ by 
the Taylor Inquiry and considered that ‘blame’ should be directed towards ‘drunken 
ticketless individuals’.***

**Chapter 12. Page 25. point 149**

&gt;*Consistent with Lord Justice Taylor’s findings, the Panel found no evidence among 
the vast number of disclosed documents and many hours of video material to 
verify the serious allegations of exceptional levels of drunkenness, ticketlessness or 
violence among Liverpool fans. There was no evidence that fans had conspired to 
arrive late at the stadium and force entry and no evidence that they stole from the 
dead and dying. Documents show that fans became frustrated by the inadequate 
response to the unfolding tragedy. The vast majority of fans on the pitch assisted in 
rescuing and evacuating the injured and the dead.*

**Chapter 12 Page 26 point 156**

**Warning Signs**

&gt;*Hillsborough was a regular venue for FA Cup semi-finals in the 1980s, hosting five matches. A crush occurred at the Leppings Lane end of the ground during the 1981 semi-final between Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers after hundreds more spectators were permitted to enter the terrace than could safely be accommodated, resulting in 38 injuries, including broken arms, legs and ribs.[15] Police believed there had been a real chance of fatalities had swift action not been taken, and recommended the club reduce its capacity. In a post-match briefing to discuss the incident, Sheffield Wednesday chairman Bert McGee remarked: ""Bollocks—no one would have been killed"".[16][17] This incident prompted Sheffield Wednesday to alter the layout at the Leppings Lane end, dividing the terrace into three separate pens to restrict sideways movement. The terrace was divided into five pens when the club was promoted to the First Division in 1984, and a crush barrier near the access tunnel was removed in 1986 to improve the flow of fans entering and exiting the central enclosure. Its capacity remained unaltered and the safety certificate was not updated. After the crush in 1981, Hillsborough was not chosen to host an FA Cup semi-final for six years until 1987.*

&gt;*Serious overcrowding was observed at the 1987 quarter-final between Sheffield Wednesday and Coventry City[18] and again during the semi-final between Coventry City and Leeds United at Hillsborough.[19] A Leeds fan described disorganisation at the turnstiles and no steward or police direction inside the stadium, resulting in the crowd in one enclosure becoming so compressed he was at times unable to raise and clap his hands. Other accounts told of fans having to be pulled to safety from above.*

&gt;*Liverpool and Nottingham Forest met in the semi-final at Hillsborough in 1988, and fans reported crushing at the Leppings Lane end. Liverpool lodged a complaint before the match in 1989. One supporter wrote to the Football Association and Minister for Sport complaining, ""The whole area was packed solid to the point where it was impossible to move and where I, and others around me, felt considerable concern for personal safety"".[20] After changes to the ground's layout in 1981, its safety certificate became invalid but was not renewed. At the time of the disaster, the ground had no safety certificate.[21]*

[Wikipedia entry on the Hillsborough disaster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsborough_disaster#Warning_signs)

The ground was not fit for purpose. There had been incidents prior to the 1989 disaster that should have been warning signs but were ignored. There was no real safety measures in place and those that were systemically failed.

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"I find it interesting that when people write these type of articles, they tend more often than not to focus on the theoretical maximum. A single adult living in my part of the West Midlands, aged between 24 - 35 [which I suspect covers a considerable chunk of the /r/unitedkingdom demographic] would receive a theoretical maximum of £578.13 per month - approx. £144.53 per week. 

This figure assumes the maximum award for housing benefit [single room, of course, following the changes to LHA last January], Contribution / Income based JSA, paid at the full amount, and council tax benefits - which they themselves don't' see, given that it's credited to their account.

So if we remove the £53 per month that the recipient doesn't actually see themselves, and thus has no control over? That leaves them with £525.13 per month - or ~£131.28 per week.

The cheapest bedsit you can find in and around tne area- in a part of town where on average, a person gets knifed to death once every six months, costs about £280PCM. That leaves £245.13 P/M or £61.28 P/W.

Then there's utilities - you're looking at  a figure of around £71.42 per month for utilities [energy + water] - if said bedsit is in shared accommodation [i.e. basically the person is renting a room] this figure might not be so high - but if articles like this can assume the highest amount, why not assume a less than ideal scenario?

That leaves £173.71 per month - £43.42 per week. Having conducted an experiment myself last year, it's possible for a single person who isn't fussy, and who doesn't need 2.500 calories per day, to survive on a food budget of £40 a month [and no I won't be sharing that, given the vitriolic abuse I've received from certain users of this sub-reddit in the past when I've done so. Google is your friend.].

Assuming the recipient can do this - that they have the access to discount grocers, the cooking skills - the cooking equipment that one requires to exist on a food budget of £40 per month?

That would leave them with £133.71 per month / £33.42 per week.

Internet access with a BT phoneline? [because not everyone is in a Virgin cabled area.] The cheapest I can find online is £28.45 a month - That seems a little high to me, I'd be more than willing to adjust this later to factor in a lower priced package.

Why the phoneline? I've heard from JSA recipients that JCP employees are telling them they *have* to have a contact number now. Because the phoneline is needed for the internet access it makes sense to utilise it, and omit a cellphone.

As for the internet connection? Receipients of JSA will be expected to spend thirty-five hours a week actively job searching [using Universal Jobmatch, of course] by the end of this parliamentary term.

Would you want to try and book 35 hours internet access weekly in a public library, using facilities that you don't know the security of?

For what it's worth the library I use for my book club allows a maximum of four hours a day - assuming you go every day that's only 28 hours a week. Sorry, you didn't meet your jobsearch requirements, automatic sanction.

So £28.45 per month internet and phone - assuming the person doesn't actually make any calls. That leaves £105.26 per month / £26.31 a week.

Travel costs - lets's assume you only go out once a week - on a ""signing week"" you do your shopping on that day, to keep costs down, on the non signing week you still only go on a bus once?

A day saver costs £3.90. That's £15.60 per month assuming, again, you use a bus once a week. £118.11 a month / ~£29.52 per week remaining.

I could perhaps go on - what happens if you have existing financial obligations [perhaps entered into prior to losing your job?] that have to be addressed?

Then there's clothing. And a whole variety of other expenses that a long-term unemployed person would be better qualified to talk about.

**All** of the above, btw, assumes you're existing / surviving. It doesn't include nor factor in, enjoyment - notice the lack of a TV licence in all the above? If you're living significantly below the poverty line, paying £36.37 a month for a TV licence is an absolute no-no.

It also - as stated, includes only:

* Living in the shittiest, grimiest, bedsit I've found over the last month. Anything in a slightly less run down area would cost at least £45 a month extra.
* One bus ride a week.
* Existing on a food budget of £40 per month.
* No ""special treats"".

My budget above leaves £29.52 per week left-over, so there is wiggle room. Of that there can be no doubt.

But consider this - If the same person were able to find a 37.5 hours a week job paying minimum wage? They'd earn £928.50 before stoppages.

That, interestingly enough given the data used for the article - amounts to an additional £350.37 than the person would be in receipt of, if they were on welfare.

Something to ponder, the next time this Government - and the right-wing press that prop 'em up, complain about ""Feckless"", or ""Feral"", or ""lazy"" welfare recipients.",0,1366977753,null,0,false,0,c9n130t,t3_1d5739,t1_c9n130t,t3_1d5739,null,1431422004,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

At the top of the above wall of text I wrote a figure - £578.13 per month¹. That's the current maximum amount a single person, in their mid 20s to mid 30s, would receive in my neck of the woods. The figure includes JSA, LHA and council tax.

At the start of 2011 that figure would have been around £713. 

In other words - a person who two years ago received £713 a month in benefits, would now receive a maximum of £578.13. That's a drop in their income of £134.87 per month - or approximately 18.91%

That number will - potentially - increase next year, as our local council introduces council tax liability for people in receipt of JSA [which some councils introduced at the start of this month.]

The fact does remain, however, that when judging there exists a number of examples where it has been proven that accusations have been made falsely that does influence whether or not we can take accusations without corroborating evidence. When you have a number of cases where it can be shown that, with two contrasting claims, there have been situations where people have been found to make false accusations I do not see how anyone can conclude with any certainty that, purely based on the two claims, that it has been proven beyond reasonable doubt.

My point is that there is a variable with regards to the testimony which averages about 7%, and it would be impossible if judging two counter claims of consent which are deemed equal to find the person guilty as a result.

That's more or less what Washington did.  But one should note that this had very little effect, despite the first President's great moral standing.

Jefferson was never a believer in the power personal morality.  He was a democratic politician, and aimed to win over the majority to his cause by rational argument.  While he failed to win the slaveholders, he became the icon of the abolitionists and his writings - especially the Declaration of Independence - were their inspiration.  His [1814 response to Edward Coles](http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=307) is worth reading in full, but this paragraph in particular is telling:

*"" I am sensible of the partialities with which you have looked towards me as the person who should undertake this salutary but arduous work. But this, my dear sir, is like bidding old Priam to buckle the armour of Hector ""trementibus aequo humeris et inutile ferruncingi."" No, I have overlived the generation with which mutual labors &amp; perils begat mutual confidence and influence. This enterprise is for the young; for those who can follow it up, and bear it through to its consummation. It shall have all my prayers, &amp; these are the only weapons of an old man. But in the mean time are you right in abandoning this property, and your country with it? I think not. My opinion has ever been that, until more can be done for them, we should endeavor, with those whom fortune has thrown on our hands, to feed and clothe them well, protect them from all ill usage, require such reasonable labor only as is performed voluntarily by freemen, &amp; be led by no repugnancies to abdicate them, and our duties to them. The laws do not permit us to turn them loose, if that were for their good: and to commute them for other property is to commit them to those whose usage of them we cannot control.""*

Loyal Order parades are normally to mark historical events (Boyne, relief of Derry, sometimes in memorial to more recent events; Ulster day and remembering victims of certain attacks.), or Church services (each district generally has at least one church service parade). These parades are normally are fairly well behaved, there are a lot of members who are completely against drinking at any parade and any sort of tomfoolery gets reported at county level and individual lodges can get reprimanded. These parades are always legal, with 11-1 forms filled in etc. Before the troubles it was not uncommon for Catholics to attend these gatherings for the crack, Scarva is a notable event, which is seeing a rise in Catholic attenders recently.

Bands generally have parades for general pageantry, awards are given out at the end of the night for different categories, these parades are often great fundraisers for the bands (uniforms and instruments aren't cheap) These events are legal and happen throughout the marching season on Friday, and Saturday nights, drinking is more common, as each band is a separate organization discipline falls within the realms of individual bands and thus behaviour varies greatly. Bands are often hired by lodges to accompany them to provide music for their own parades.

Paramilitary associated groups have parades for their own reasons, legality of these events vary and again bands are invited depending on their affiliation.

And if there was still any confusion as to what Cameron's stance is on the matter, he answered it on 5-live, loud and clear. Good luck finding parallels with the Terry case, which was no more than a whisper.

true,DarcyHart,english,Hampshire,"For a start is it was Darwin and a chap called Alfred Russel Wallace that came up with the theory. And then Darwin took the fame when he wrote the widely spread book.

Here is a quote from Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis (1678-1759):-

[""Could we not explain in this manner [of fortuitous changes] how the multiplication of the most dissimilar species could have sprung from just two individuals? They would owe their origin to some fortuitous productions in which the elementary parts [of heredity] deviated from the order maintained in the parents. Each degree of error would have created a new species, and as a result of repeated deviations the infinite diversity of animals that we see today would have come about."" Systèm de la Nature 2:164, quoted in Terrell 2002:338](http://scienceblogs.com/evolvingthoughts/2007/01/23/the-man-who-invented-evolution/)



The idea and thought of evolution isn't new at all, and [lot's before Darwin came up with scientific theories.](http://anthro.palomar.edu/evolve/evolve_1.htm) It's just Darwin's and Wallace's topped them all by making the most sense.

The great challenge we've faced as a nation, in the living memory of almost the entire population, has been to refound our economy and find a sustainable place in the modern world after the end of Empire. We have so much from our history we might to turn to in order to drive that reformed national spirit, of scientific enquiry, technological innovation, and commerce, if we would just look in the right direction.

If we want faces to go on notes, Alan Turing is the obvious example, but I would just as well completely redesign the bank-notes, along the lines of [this proposal from Switzerland](http://www.snb.ch/en/iabout/cash/newcash/id/cash_new_result/3), using some of the great symbols of British science. British or British-based scientists have won Nobel prizes for discovering the laws of electromagnetism (Maxwell); stem cells (John Gurdon); the structures of DNA (Watson and Crick), buckminsterfullerene (Harry Kroto) and graphene (Geim and Novoselov at Manchester), the latter two of which are key discoveries of nanotechnology. Go back further and you can have the the circulatory system (William Harvey), the Laws of Motion (Newton), and one of the first computers ([Babbage's Difference Engine](http://people.uncw.edu/tompkinsj/112/texnh/images/BabbageDifferenceEngine.jpg)). 

Instead we choose Churchill, who is a glorious historical figure of little modern relevance, a man who was an imperial throw-back even sixty years ago. Who undoubtedly helped to win the war, and saved many lives, but in so doing irrevocably closed a chapter in history, and ultimately made himself irrelevant. When peace came, his main idea was an attempt to go back to the good old days of imperial ambition. He's been chosen now by our very own imperial class, most of whom have been through the same classical education system as their equivalents in 1870. Who spend most of their time in and around their mock-Gothic palace, built in 1870 to look like something from the 14th century. A couple of years ago I read Orwell's essays, and it seems to me that our culture and the problems and fault lines inherent to it, have ultimately changed less than we would hope over the last 75 years.

Do you think that the right to an attorney is dependent upon a citizen's ability to pay?  I didn't ask it directly, but you didn't draw any distinction when confronted by the comparison.

Yes, and that has to be sorted out democratically.  As a first approximation, I would suggest putting the economy under democratic control, rather than the current regime of individual decisions by the few.

I'm not sure i agree that you are having to 'jump through hoops' with respect to the usability of BitEasy. This service is tailored for convenience. You fill out the form, and send the BTC to the payment address. The code is in your inbox 20 mins later. I don't think there's a simpler way of making this type of purchase (BTC-&gt;Non BTC vendor).

The exchange rates are just a necessary evil of using such a volatile currency/commodity, and i thought taking the rate from the most liquid market gives us the truest value of BTC at any given time. The exchange rates are market rates with no mark up.

(Winston Churchill)

The main problem is the inflation we see now is nothing like the inflation of the 70s.  Sure the 70s suffered a problem with oil prices going crazy, poor supply of coal etc.  So when people try and talk about past experiences learned then, they really probably don't apply.

One of the biggest adjustments we are seeing is the rise of the cheap labour.  The last few decades we've benefited massively from cheaper *things*, most people own a mobile phone, a tv, a computer or some sort.  They all cost very little thanks to low labour costs in China etc.  However as the wages rise, automation isn't filling the void, which is what traditionally happens in manufacturing.

But it is more than that, certain key consumables which we have to buy we in effect have to out-bid these guys for.  That's fine and dandy when they earn $50 a month, but not so much when they are earning $200.

Interestingly we also have a strange, almost neo-luddite movement on food.  We are shunning high yielding crops and farming techniques, we are demanding more meat, given the limited arable land the rise of organic food isn't helping either!  This means real essentials such as Bread have risen in price a lot lately, it was 30p a loaf just 10 years ago.  Food prices are always volatile, subject to the weather and the like, but we are seeing wholesale prices remain high, the free market is incentivised to find new better ways of meeting this demand, but it isn't managing too.  You can debate if this is due to rising population, lack of 'trust' in public about GM, or just decent living standards for the producers later.

So we've got higher cost for shiny toys, higher costs for food, we've also got higher costs for life, our tax bill as a country is really quite big, we're not just in debt, we're in deficit, we're unable to pay the interest on our debt!

That will mean that you get less government services and less money in your pocket.  The sneaky thing about Quantitative Easing or printing money is that it makes everyone who uses pounds sterling poorer, if you get any pay rise you can move higher up the tax liability side too.

Towards the worst end of the predictions, people talk of a lost decade, this is normally [targeted at Japan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Decade_(Japan)).  Now the issue is how do we avoid that?  Some people think the answer is to spend money we borrow.  Pretty much everyone agrees with that idea in principle, but the issue is how much money can you borrow, and how should you spend that money?

Given the debt levels we inherited thanks to very poor fiscal policy, a lot of people (myself included) are quite simply scared.  There are some models and the like we can use to justify our position but its one of fear.  Ever made a bad business decision?  I have.... Luckily it only cost me money I had, if I'd borrowed money, it would have been a terribly miserable pain, rather than just a bad pain.  That is the mindset, it is better to take a minor pain now, than borrow money, fuck it up even more.

There is the other side of the coin, they say how can things get better if we don't spend money.  They have the belief that government money creates jobs, the opposite stance to those who belief that government money steals jobs (as the government gets its money from some source, even if they print it).

The obvious answer is its a mix of the two, but anyone who claims to know with any fact or certainty the answer is just a lier or someone to dumb to realise how dumb they are.  Myself I think of it as a great risk to borrow money, so I'll take a certain pain now, over an uncertain future pain that might be many times worse.  But then the pain now probably won't affect me much anyway, and that decision is based in emotional fear.

One thing's for certain, if we do fully enter a lost decade the gap between the haves and havenots will increase, many of the consumerist things we take for granted will become more expensive, we will also have to look at the elephant in the room, retired people.

true,Cinemaslap1,jack,Jack Harkness,"&gt;Time Lord detecting sixth sense isn't always reliable. After all, in ""The Other Doctor"" Ten thought for a good half the episode that he had met a future regeneration of himself, and didn't learn until later that he was actually a delusional human. If his sixth sense was foolproof, wouldn't he have known right away that the other Doctor was not actually another Doctor? 

It was actually ""The Next Doctor"", but that's just me being anal about that. As for the sixth sense, it's explained before in the first part of series 3 with the Fob watch. If a time lord had used that (like the Master did) then they are rewritten as human until the watch is re-opened. That's why in the ""Next Doctor"" when Tennant finds it, he believes that the ""doctor"" had used it to disguise himself from the Cybermen.

&gt;Yes, but they make a very big deal out of the fact that she's a doctor.

They make a big deal out of everything in this show, to throw you off. And personally, I would think it's a big deal if someone got two/three doctorites in completely different subject fields, that can take a really long time.

The situations are:

&gt; (a) any person was, at the time of the relevant act or immediately before it began, using violence against the complainant or causing the complainant to fear that immediate violence would be used against him;

&gt; (b) any person was, at the time of the relevant act or immediately before it began, causing the complainant to fear that violence was being used, or that immediate violence would be used, against another person;

&gt; (c) the complainant was, and the defendant was not, unlawfully detained at the time of the relevant act;

&gt; (d) the complainant was asleep or otherwise unconscious at the time of the relevant act;

&gt; (e) because of the complainant’s physical disability, the complainant would not have been able at the time of the relevant act to communicate to the defendant whether the complainant consented;

&gt; (f) any person had administered to or caused to be taken by the complainant, without the complainant’s consent, a substance which, having regard to when it was administered or taken, was capable of causing or enabling the complainant to be stupefied or overpowered at the time of the relevant act.

If one of these are proved (by the prosecution) to apply, the jury can assume lack of consent (and lack of reasonable belief in consent) unless the defence adduces enough evidence to raise an issue about the presumption, in which case the burden of proof goes back to the prosecution.

Dammit, you're right. I knew I should have double checked that.   
   
&gt; As for the sixth sense, it's explained before in the first part of series 3 with the Fob watch. If a time lord had used that (like the Master did) then they are rewritten as human until the watch is re-opened. That's why in the ""Next Doctor"" when Tennant finds it, he believes that the ""doctor"" had used it to disguise himself from the Cybermen.    
    
Yes, but that's only after he's realized the other ""Doctor"" is human. If you watch the episode, when he first meets the other ""Doctor"" he very clearly, very readily believes that he is indeed meeting a future incarnation of himself. It isn't until he has reason to be suspicious (I believe it's the ""sonic screwdriver"" that's just a regular screwdriver that tips him off, but it has been a while) that he examines the other ""Doctor"" more closely and realizes he's human.    
    
&gt; They make a big deal out of everything in this show, to throw you off.    
    
True.    
    
&gt; And personally, I would think it's a big deal if someone got two/three doctorites in completely different subject fields, that can take a really long time.    
    
Well, yeah, in real life. But it's like I said before about the Law of Conservation of Detail. Why would they even make the ""two/three doctorates"" thing part of her biography if it wasn't going to pay off at some point down the line? It can't be for the sake of character development, because god knows Steven Moffat doesn't give a rat's ass about that.    
    
&gt; I am not trying to be mean and finding ways to disprove your theory, I just personally don't like it and see a lot of holes in it... Nothing against your theory though.

true,Call_me_pedantic_but,english,the North,"I agree with many of the proposed changes, but the interview with Margaret Hodge is just plain ridiculous. 

She expresses surprise that KPMG 'put' someone in the Treasury to advice on tax legislation, and then used that inside knowledge to advise companies on the most effective to utilise those reliefs. Either she is being duplicitous in expressing surprise, or she is just plain stupid. 

* The Treasury sought the advise of these experts, this wasn't the result of a lobby for influence, or sneeking in under cover of darkness. 
* It is their job to advise companies on the most efficient use of tax reliefs. Why would they be expected to do any different in this case, and really, why is this a problem unless they are exploiting the system?

Also i wish that some fans would shut the fuck up about conspiracy theory about the club as a whole being hated or targetted by every official or by the FA. Yes, we have had some terrible decisions go against us, and yes i do think Suarez reputation does preceed him, but as Suarez as a person, an we as a club don't help ourselves at times either. Whether you want to admit it or not, what he did deserved a lengthy ban. But, its done now, lets move on and focus on finishing with as many points as possible.

Edit: Also, wanted to point out that i was at United game last year and there was a few dickheads on our own sides making plenty of references to Munich throughout the match. There will always be that small minority of fans who give the rest a bad rep.",0,1366991153,null,0,false,0,c9n4v7o,t3_1d5esb,t1_c9n4v7o,t1_c9n25oz,null,1431420150,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

If you're looking for an exact replica, I couldn't find one but I'd honestly expect someone to make one at some point during the series. Someone made an [iPhone case](http://www.redbubble.com/people/oswins/works/10202965-101-places-to-see) and I saw some t-shirts, but with the leaf instead of the globe. 

If you really want an exact replica, like, now, I would find a website that makes bound books with custom covers (googling something like ""custom guestbook"" should find a couple), and contact them and show them [the cover of the book in the show](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130412121221/tardis/images/f/fb/101PlacesToSee.jpg) and ask what they can do.

true,sickgrof,num10-away,,"Couple of quick thoughts:

Bale vs. Lyon and Dembele vs. Lyon both came so late in the match that it added to their brilliance. They were great goals, but at another time in the match, they would've been just that, great goals, not goals of the season. So, while they are great goals, they don't make my cut.

Bale vs. West Ham was just a sensational goal...literally in the perfect spot of the net, nothing Jaskawhatsits could do about it and it was at the end of the match, which is looking like it's going to be a huge extra 2 points. I would rank this third, behind Defoe's (look down), and my winner (to be revealed).

Bale vs. Norwich was an extremely impressive run, especially because he got hit and could've went down, but powered through to stay on his feet and finish the job.

Vertonghen vs Swansea: I'm assuming this is the one that he caught over the top from Bale with unbelievable skill for a CB...the way he brought it onto his toe and poked it around form was just crazy to see from a center half. As far as skill level goes, this would be my goal of the season (but only from a skill level point of view, it's not my actual one).

Lennon vs. Sunderland was beautiful to see. Truly Lennon at his best. Pokes around the defender, shows blistering pace, and curls it in. Not the goal of the season for me, but still definitely a tremendous goal.

Defoe vs. West Ham is my runner up for GOTS. Getting it at the half way line, zigging and zagging around defenders and finishing beautifully. This goal truly had it all.

Sandro vs. Fulham was a tremendous strike from our #SandroBeast, but still a best of a mess up from the Fulham Keeper, so that lowers it *just a bit*

**So, the winner for my Goal of the Season is....**

Bale vs Manchester United: The sleeper! Goal that wasn't even on the shortlist sneaks in for the title. Bale picks up the pass at the half way line, uses lightning pace to dribble past defenders, abuses Rio, and tucks it in to the far bottom corner with his right foot!

Partly related. What the Suarez incident does to the image of Football through the video, pictures etc being circulated is certainly perfectly allowed to have an effect on their judgement. Both Civil and Criminal court takes the effect on the 'victims', person or business, reputation into account when making a judgement and that is exactly the same and also justifiable.

I wanted to adress this first, because I sometimes nerd rage on stupid shit. But I enjoy this debate to, cause I have few other people that I actually can debate stuff like this with.

I'm actually going to work backwards, because of my random ass thought process.

&gt;It can't be for the sake of character development, because god knows Steven Moffat doesn't give a rat's ass about that. 

I disagree with this. When something is important for the character, we find Moffat puts the things in very subtle and only puts in things you need to know (with the occasional off track comment to throw you off). But think about what we had in Blink with Sally Sparrow, we knew very little about her other than the items that would move the story forward and keep it's pace. It's the same with the Amy Pond, we had no reason to know her parents or who she was living with until that finale/other-verse.

&gt;Why would they even make the ""two/three doctorates"" thing part of her biography if it wasn't going to pay off at some point down the line? It can't be for the sake of character development, because god knows Steven Moffat doesn't give a rat's ass about that.

This already has paid off, we have her doctorite with archeology in her first story Silence in the Library, her being a professor in Flesh and stone paid off with her knowledge of the original race that lived on that planet.

&gt;when he first meets the other ""Doctor"" he very clearly, very readily believes that he is indeed meeting a future incarnation of himself. It isn't until he has reason to be suspicious (I believe it's the ""sonic screwdriver"" that's just a regular screwdriver that tips him off, but it has been a while) that he examines the other ""Doctor"" more closely and realizes he's human

I actually rewatched this over my lunch break today, I don't think he believes him. i think it's more of him keeping his mouth shut until he can understand what's going on. I think initially he thinks of the Fob, but just keeps quiet about what he knows till he can explain everything to him.

And finally &gt;Dammit, you're right. I knew I should have double checked that

As far as an actual tax is concerned. It's contributes to the roads In the same way as vat/paye/corp/stamp tax does.

The largest funder of roads/pavement is in fact council tax which of course everyone pays.

So yeah - cyclists pay as much as anyone to fund the ""public highway""

But anyway...UKIP? Not too surprised.

** ""road tax"" is not a road tax, it's called VED and is based on the emissions of your vehicle and has nothing todo with road usage and rights. Those who use low co2 emission vehicles (hrbrids/fiat 500s etc) pay £0 - cyclists by default would therefore pay £0 too.

Nope. In fact there's evidence suggesting the opposite is true. This would discourage cycling presumably  (especially in a city like Cambridge where many cyclists are from out of the country), so if the law is obeyed we would have fewer cyclists on the road. Research has shown that the number of cyclists on the road is most important when it comes to safety. It's a more important factor than cycle helmets for example. Essentially there's safety in numbers, meaning that on an individual basis cyclists are safer. 

Besides, this would just be yet more unnecessary authoritarian legislation, and not to mention unenforceable.

true,SirMuttley,cnty-uk,British in Bangkok,"&gt; Where is the evidence in support of your view? You're saying that a declaration of the inalienable right of citizens to life has no implications for health care. Can you prove that? Or at least find other cases in which the declaration of rights did not have implications on the duties of the government to advance those rights?

Read any analysis of the declaration and you will see the preamble pertains to the justification for revolution when a government harms the **God** given rights to life, liberty and happiness. So it means when a government is doing something to harm people's lives just like the British government was doing to the people of the American colonies. If you get ill it's not the government who is harming your right to life, unless they're actively stopping you from seeking medical attention. However that is not the same as them having a duty to give you medical attention for free. God doesn't make me better when I am ill, so how can they mean that the government should?

Lets say for instance we look upon the part about happiness. Using the same interpretation you have for life surely it's the government's duty to send me somewhere warm when the winter makes me unhappy? Or to find me a new job when mine sucks?

Anyway here's some links for you:

 * [Explained for grown ups](http://www.sparknotes.com/history/american/declaration/section1.rhtml)

Ultimately the Declaration of Independence was a letter to King George III about why they were splitting from the British Empire. If you want to believe that one of the reasons was because of the lack of public health care then go ahead. But I'd be amazed if you found many people who actually agreed with you.

&gt; Ah, the truth comes out. You really just want people to defer to their ""social betters"", don't you? (This probably explains your dislike of Jefferson!)

What nonsense. I never said I disliked Jefferson, I just pointed out some of his flaws. I'm sorry if you found them upsetting, but every man has them.

As for deferring to their ""social betters"", again complete nonsense. But the fact is the majority of voters aren't equipped to make informed decisions on the economy. I know I'm certainly not and I have a maths degree. All that will happen is that policy will be formed and put forward. Each party will say how they think it should be voted on and the vast majority of the electorate will vote the way their party of choice recommends them to. So really, what is the point? The reason we have elections is to vote for people we trust to make these decisions for us because frankly we're not in the position to. Maybe you're an economics professors as well as a Jefferson scholar, that's great. But the rest of us aren't.

&gt; No evidence. Clearly this is just ""your interpretation"".

Sorry, I figured as Jefferson is your thing you'd either know of this or know how to find it. But here you go:

&gt; [Punishments I know are necessary, &amp; I would provide them, strict &amp; inflexible, but proportioned to the crime. Death might be inflicted for murther &amp; perhaps for treason if you would take out of the description of treason all crimes which are not such in their nature.

&gt;I completely disagree that this has to happen. I think the city of London would be far better served by reducing the size of Heathrow, and re-claiming the land it currently uses for other purposes.

So your opinion just became pretty much worthless because this is absurd and after reading that I have trouble taking you seriously.

&gt;I don't see the current era of cheap flights continuing for the expected life of an expanded airport.

There is no evidence that the extent of the airline industry is in any way a bubble, overall trends of steady persistant growth have continued for half a century, and we're hitting about 35 million flights per year worldwide at this point. Heathrow is the third busiest airport in the world, it's at 98% capacity, and commercial air-travel continues to expand. 

As it is, listening to the objectors is just doing the same as has happened with our power industry, we'll reach a point where there are major problems which could have been avoided because we'll pander to the nimbys for year after year, and then eventually be forced to do the thing anyway because it has to happen, but we'll do it 10 years later than it should have happened, and thus incur lots of problems as a result.

&gt;It's quite possible that the bubble of international aviation could burst just as construction work is completed on the proposed runway.

Intelligent people work out what is likely and then plan based on the outcomes.

You have clearly picked an outcome and are trying to work out arguments in favour of this. Spouting ""if"" and ""could""'s of such extremity without some serious, serious evidence just makes your argument look half-baked.

&gt;If you're not sure how people could be opposed to this, maybe you should pay a visit to the area that would be demolished to make way for the new runway and talk to some of the people that would have their communities destroyed.

But of course people many locals will oppose it. I'm just saying we should ignore them because they constitute a few thousand people in a country of 62,000,000 which needs this.

Personally I would imagine that offer at the time would be considered a one off thing and wouldn't necessarily be relevant to the current situation (ie it was made in the context of the damp room etc).

That being said, so long as you all agree you could always offer to find new tenants. Ultimately all the landlord probably cares about is having reliable tenants who pay their rent on time with no fuss, so he may agree to have the leases assigned to someone else. 
 

You should probably stop by your local citizens advice before getting back in touch with the landlord, since theyre generally pretty good at providing advice in landlord disputes, and may even offer to draft letters for you - or they might refer you on to Shelter (a housing charity, also good for advice).",0,1367004461,null,0,false,0,c9na1yy,t3_1d5u7w,t1_c9na1yy,t1_c9n8hp9,null,1431417706,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I assume he actually thinks that cyclists are an entitled bunch of so-and-so's and that if he voices his 'silent majority' opinion then those campaigners will realise how preposterous their campaign for such pathetic things as 'road safety' are and will disband their group, put their bike away and get in the Vauxhall for their daily commute.

I mean, When those ancient feet looked upon the \*mountains* green,  when the lord God (anglican God that is, not a catholic one and certainly not 'Allah', (God (anglican God) forbid)), crafted this land I'm sure they never lamented the lack of cycle paths.

I also highly doubt Winston Churchill would have much regard for those pedalling peddlers of personal and pedestrian safety when Jerry were threatening us all with their strong national identity, aggressive demeanour, distaste for other cultures and faith in the inherent goodness of their own creation.

In fact, once while listening to Jeremy Vine on radio 2, I heard that 'cycle paths' make up 25% of murderers in the UK and they should be pro-actively institutionalised according to a Psychiatrist or a Highways agency fellow or some sort of figure of authority who was a special guest.

But everybody treats the fez like its the most important thing anybody has ever put on their head. And he only wore it for like 3 minutes before it got blown up. 

That image has cybermen and weeping angels, 2 incredibly significant enemies. It has the smiling apple and fish custard, all things that represent the relationship between the Doctor and Amy. It has Rory's helmet, for when he was and remained Rory the Roman! It has River's Diary and her Vortex manipulator. It has Vincent Van Gogh's sunflowers, recognizing his importance as the one who predicted the destruction of the TARDIS. It has Amy's reading glasses that the Doctor still wears ever after he loses her. It has Oswin's souffle which helped begin a new mystery and a new chapter in the Doctor's life and journey. All of these things have some sort of meaning to them and then there's just the silly looking, meaningless fez sitting on the Doctor's head.

People who are found ""not proven"" are people who have committed a crime but under Scots Law, are not able to be totally proven to be guilty and given a custodial sentence.

Not proven means, ""we know you did it, and you know you did too, you lying bawbag but we can't utterly prove it"".

So, they're classified as ""not proven"". They don't go to jail, and they're not punished, but that verdict of not proven will stick with them.

It's not given out lightly AFAIK,  and is given in cases where proving them guilty is hard, say because witnesses are too scared to come forward and testify.
