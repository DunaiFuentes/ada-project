The twisted irony is, it is somehow okay for a settlement to vote to be independent - but it isn't okay for it to vote to stay part of a former-colonial power... such is the distorted logic of the 21st century, and of the UN in particular.

The problem is, with only 2000 permanent residents an independent Falklands would actually be the 2nd smallest sovereign nation in the world - the smallest being Vatican city which isn't really a nation in the true sense of the word. Just administering their own sovereignty would practically consume their entire workforce - let alone policing their pretty sizeable territory from, for lack of a better word, a horde of aggressive neighbours.

My guess is before independence they might become some kind of protectorate... probably much like Burma did (where it was technically a soverign nation, but relied on the UK for defence).

true,vishbar,eng-hampshire,Yank in Winchester,"I consider myself an environmentalist. I love renewables! Wind power, geothermic power, and, where effective, solar are all absolutely awesome supplemental power sources for a power grid.

*Supplemental*.

There are two types of power plants: baseload and peak load. The requirement to be a baseload plant is simple: *always produce a predictable level of electricity.* Always. Not ""when it's windy"", not ""when the sun is shining"", not ""on wavey days"".

Currently, we have a few choices for baseload plants. The only one that would be considered ""renewable"" is hydroelectric--and hydroelectric plants can be devastating to the local environment. Plus, some places simply aren't suited for large-scale hydroelectric power, so let's take a look at the other options.

We can look at the fossil-fuel plants next. Coal, oil, and even natural gas (though to a lower extent) all have the same problem: carbon emissions. Far from being a local concern, this has escalated into a *global* problem. Plus coal plants, in particular, have quite a high rate of deaths/kilowatt-hour, raising safety concerns.

Nuclear, on the other hand, is carbon-free, safe (Fukushima and, especially, Chernobyl were aberrations), and produce loads of power. There's a relatively high start-up cost, and the maintenance costs can reduce some of the financial advantages of cheaper fuel, but overall, in my opinion, it's the best option by far.

I think a lot of proponents of renewable energy don't understand that, at the moment, we don't have a good way to store large amounts of energy in the long term. We can't really build a giant capacitor that can emit a steady charge to cope with fluctuating power output from renewable sources. There have been advances recently like molten salt storage, but they're just not mature enough to provide a baseload that can satisfy current energy demands.",0,1363724957,null,0,false,0,c8ynver,t3_1alb15,t1_c8ynver,t1_c8yke3o,null,1431637904,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Look back on our results since the new year and we've only won by more than one goal once (Reading) and we've hardly been world class against West Brom, Norwich, QPR etc. I see some people mentioning the West Ham game - we were by far the worst team for the first 80 minutes or so. They were camped out in our box, crossing time and time again for Carroll, plus they had opportunities to score the third as well. We had a productive last 10 minutes where we forced some saves, but that's all. It was the same against Newcastle: very even game until we scored the second and they had to chase the game for the last 10 and Bale missed those chances for his hat-trick.

I think people have been getting carried away with our habit of scoring last-minute goals and forgetting that consistently needing last-minute goals is not a great attribute to have. I like AVB and believe we are on the right track, but it still bugs me how quickly people dismiss Harry. Our defence was a little looser, but we won games far more comfortably. Just look at Arsenal last weekend, they went to Swansea and won 2-0. Job done. We know it won't be the same story with Tottenham.

Of course we know the main problem for us is our strikers. A stat that might interest some people: it's been **839 minutes since either Adebayor or Defoe has scored in the Premier League**.

true,cacafogo,num5,,"Most of you will probably disagree with me.  I honestly believe that the influence that CL would have on our club is overstated.  The revenue would obviously be fantastic, but we have been (and hopefully will continue to be) financially responsible.  That means that we aren't going to splash a ton of cash on expensive players that could only be paid for with continued success.  We don't want to be Leeds.  We will find players at the same price we've been at, and we will pay them the same amount of money we have been.  I think we would be more likely to put that money to the new stadium.  Excellent, but not necessary to have.  

That means the money is irrelevant to getting new players from our perspective, and out as a motivator for new players, which leaves only their desire to play in the CL as an attractor.  Obviously every player wants to play in the Champion's League.  But think, who are we going to draw solely on that, who otherwise wouldn't want to play for us?  Vertonghen chose to play for us over Arsenal.  They were in the CL, and we were not.  Clearly that was not the only factor swaying his decision.  Liverpool signed Coutinho; Champion's League obviously didn't pull him there.  I think any player who we realistically have a shot at signing will sign regardless of CL.  I also think there are plenty of great players at clubs that aren't even playing in Europe that would improve our squad.  Yes, Champion's League is a huge draw, but is it necessary?  Not at all.  

Perhaps you will argue that if we go after the same player as another club, CL will be the thing that would sway them.  I say perhaps, but if it is another club in the CL in any of the major leagues, we won't compete with their finances anyway.  If the other club isn't in CL, then they don't have that advantage either.  Perhaps you will argue that we need CL to keep Bale.  Again, I answer ""perhaps"".  He has given no indication on wanting to leave no matter where we end up.  It also wouldn't be the end of the world because we will get money to replace him, and I am perfectly happy letting AVB build his own team.

Enough about CL, lets look at this from another direction.  We just changed managers and lost two of our best players.  Our success in the league so far has hidden the fact that we are still a team in transition.  We have yet to see the best of what AVB has to offer.  All our players are praising his ability as a manager, and that is a major draw.  We just built a new training ground, and have a new stadium on the way.  Those are major draws.  We are performing well in one of the best leagues in the world, another major draw (see a pattern here?).  Now think about if we win the Europa League.  Despite many people's ridiculous attitudes, that is a major piece of silverware, especially outside of the top leagues.  It would give everyone at the club a boost.  It would give us a chance at another cup next year against the CL winners.  It would also be a major draw to any players we realistically have a shot at signing.

I believe a Europa win will help us continue our upward trajectory, and therefore is not a bad alternative to qualifying for the Champion's League.  It would be disastrous if we failed at both.  Wow, that got really lengthy.

true,phys1cs,null,null,"Not really, no. It's a lot compared to current prices, but at the moment a large fraction of our electricity comes from old coal and nuclear plants that were build by the government. In the near future, we can expect several things to happen

 * Many of the coal plants will shut. Those that stay open will have to pay a carbon tax (and/or convert to expensive biomass fuel or (as yet unproven, and likely to be very expensive initially) carbon capture and storage.

 * North Sea gas production will decline, domestic shale gas is still some way off and is unlikely to be as cheap or abundant. Globally, demand for LNG (which makes up a large fraction of current UK supply) will rise. Any US shale gas exports will probably go straight to Japan... Gas might even get cheaper, but gas power stations probably won't - carbon pricing and loss of some peak revenue due to intermittent renewables (as has happened in Germany) will mean that gas stations will probably get less profitable. The UK can't afford not to have the gas stations, so they'll be subsidised through a capacity payment.

 * Onshore wind will continue to be relatively unpopular and slow to develop. Offshore wind will still be very expensive; both will have the disadvantages of intermittency and lack of storage - the economics may remain favourable for developers, but consumers will ultimately have to pay more as market share increases. Solar will remain an expensive irrelevance. 

These factors will probably mean that electricity is going to be getting more expensive whatever happens. If the market is to provide new capacity, they'll demand a higher rate of return than previous government-funded infrastructure required. Generally, a 10% discount rate (the return on investment before the cost of capital is deducted) is thought to be required for private sector investment. This is roughly what EDF are asking for at the moment, and is the kind of figure most previous estimates for prices would have been based on prior to the government embarking on electricity market reform.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/atsKx7b.png) is a chart of the predicted unit costs of electricity from a [2010](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/65715/71-uk-electricity-generation-costs-update-.pdf) study, putting first of a kind nuclear in the region of ¬£95/MWh, which is about what EDF are asking for at the moment, although the price is highly likely to fall if further stations are built. Onshore wind will be around the same or slightly less, offshore wind significantly more; neither will be able to provide the reliable generation nuclear can. New gas or coal capacity would be somewhat cheaper if carbon prices are ignored*, but still a good deal more expensive than current wholesale prices.

\*Anywhere else, you *might* be somewhat justified in ignoring carbon prices, since the European carbon market has collapsed. Not wanting to miss a chance to raise some of that sweet tax revenue, the government has set a minimum price, the difference between the market price and the floor price going to our dear leaders. Possibly...

true,Girlwithnousername,null,null,"&gt; In your view but you know so much about tax and how it works with umbrella companies you don't even know that when you claim an expense you only get back the income tax you'd have paid on that income.

I knew that, I was being dramatic. 

&gt; Please explain why you think you're losing ¬£2500 a year because TBH your original post was very full of opinion and it was very hard to pull out actual facts, even with the tl;dr which really wasn't one.

Hourly rate quoted versus actual hourly rate received; remember that the agent threw the umbrella bit on me at the last minute. 

&gt; You're paying for a service with the umbrella company. You are being correctly compensated for expenses claims and you're paying the correct fees in respect to employers NI etc.

I agree, and I have no issue with that. 

&gt; Your only other alternative to continue in this job is to set up as a limited company which will then save you money on the umbrella company fees but you'll have to pay an accountant however that will be far cheaper. You'll still pay employers NI though and you'll still only get 20% of the expenses in your pocket.

That's certainly one idea, but it's not going to work. Within a short period of time it will become a 'go perm or leave' situation. It's just a public sector thing. 

&gt;You could take the agency to tribunal but then you'll be hit with a massive tax bill from HMRC for most if not all the expenses you've claimed as they would not be allowed under PAYE.

Yes, no point. And one must choose your battles carefully in life. Too much emotional energy for not that much gain. 

&gt; As someone who has worked for agencies for 10 years I'm surprised you're not more on the ball in respect to this kind of set up between agencies and agency workers. They've been doing it for some time now and it has become even more prevalent with the AWR as a way of circumventing them.

1) I worked through the same agency for 7 years who were always PAYE, and 2) that is much more prevalent for CONTRACTORS, and not temps. I am a temp. I guess NOW I am contractor officially. This is the first time an agency have insisted in this sort of setup. Of course, occasionally I've come across the odd IT contractor who has tried to convince me that a limited company would be much more financially advantageous (and at the time, in longer-term, ongoing roles, it might've made sense), but when I started to investigate it, it was really relying on the tax man being generous re: what you expense. I came across a few people who'd had IR tax investigations which were brutal, and one who became bankrupt and had a nervous breakdown as a result (they wanted 20 years of incorrectly expensed taxes back). 

So, it's always been PAYE, never once this setup.

Moved overseas on two distinct occasions. I first moved to the Netherlands but returned to the UK for personal reasons after about a couple of years. I enjoyed being there. After that I moved to Frankfurt in Germany. My work took me to a lot of other places including Eastern Europe and Central Asia but my base stayed in Frankfurt as it was large enough to be interesting but not overwhelmingly so and the lifestyle was good. I even ended up reverse-commuting on one project, flying back to the UK Monday through Friday. It was just a project and by that time I had a family in Frankfurt so too much effort to relocate.

Working for myself, I received no assistance with relocation, OTOH as an EU person it isn't that hard. The nuances you get from talking to other expats.

true,custerc,null,null,"American here. I only became an LFC supporter last year. I have always liked soccer, and followed international soccer for quite a while. When I moved to Beijing, I became a fan of the Beijing club, but China's professional soccer league is both (a) terrible and (b) corrupt as fuck so I started looking for something more.

My father has been a Spurs supporter for a while now, so he encouraged me to pick an EPL team. Of course he wanted me to pull for Spurs but at the time they were in the top four, and I thought arbitrarily picking a top four team was kind of a cheap thing to do (when my dad started supporting spurs they weren't top four), so I started looking at the mid-table clubs, reading up about their rivalries, stadiums, history, etc. 

Liverpool appealed to me because of the club's history, and also because of Gerrard, who I knew from watching international soccer and very much liked. I knew he was a class act on and off the field, so seeing his dedication to the club really cemented it for me. LFC just *felt* special to me in a way that none of the other clubs did as I learned about it and the rest, as they say, is history...

We are behind many countries but you need a sense of perspective really.

Still, one of the reasons mortality is higher in children is Teenage Pregnancy. I can give you more later, if you wish, I can't be bothered to search right now.

Before 2010, the most experience I had with soccer was as a 6 year old in 1999 who was worried about the flowers on the field getting smushed instead of kicking the ball. SO I'm on of those who came into it from the 2010 world cup. After watching all the teams, I zeroed in on Spain (no regrets, they're amazing, as are many other teams), and Fernando Torres was the one who I noticed first, even though he didn't score much, and let's not talk about the final when he hurt himself. So I looked into him, saw that he played for LFC, watched some of their games. I did the same thing with other players on Spain that played in the EPL, but fell hard for LFC. It killed me when he left half-way through that season, and I still haven't forgiven him.

So......that's really it. and it's spiraled from there - watching every game that I could since the 2010-11 season, buying shirts and scarves and calendars and other random stuff, traveling 5 hours to Boston this past summer to see them play Roma and getting to meet the team afterwards (and getting to go onto Fenway and kick PKs at Danny Ward at HT!), and now studying in England next year and hopefully getting to see them play more than a few times while i'm there.

EDIT: I'm from New York and have no friends that watch football so everyone thought it was odd but whatever, I was happy and that was really all that mattered.

Compared to Lamps, who has made it clear (by reports) to Chelsea that he wants to stay and again (by reports) is willing to take a pay cut, however, Chelsea aren't / weren't interested in even giving him an offer. 

The fuss is more along the lines of Chelsea not treating Lamps like a legend and are instead treating him just like any schmuck. From a business view point its understandable. But football isn't just about business to us fans.

true,Sauletekis,null,null,"American expat here, I've lived the better part of the last decade in the UK and became a citizen in September.

The why is the easy part - I came here first as a student (as oh so many Americans do), I met a guy, fell in love, got married, and have been here ever since. So I chose the UK, and then the UK kind of chose me back.

My observations and comparisons:

You are a nation that loves fair play and the notion of fairness. This is basically the complete opposite of America, where the extreme 'free market' dictats in our culture have resulted in a good chunk of the population believing that some should be the 1%, and that if you are living in deepest poverty, well, that's your own damn fault. This one British virtue, above everything else, is the one that I love most about my adoptive homeland, namely because you are so intelligent about it - you recognize, for example, that someone with a rough inner city background isn't competing on a level playing field to someone that has been monied since birth, and you've built a government support system that at many levels seeks to lift up the poor and to make life more fair. Don't ever change this about yourselves.

You enjoy a level of health security that was unknown to me from life in the US. Your NHS is a shining example to the world and you should be so, so proud of it. Knowing now that, if I get made redundant in this turbulent economy, and then shortly there after get hit by a bus, that I won't be made bankrupt by medical bills and will receive some of the best care in the world - wow. I teared up more at the opening ceremony hat tip to the NHS than at any other moment.

Even after a decade, I still don't really get how to use sarcasm as a form of demonstrating affection. Taking the piss to show you like someone confuses my literal American brain. It's strange.

Your food is fucking awful, and for this I am also thankful. If I lived in the US, I would weigh 40 stone and be the size of a house. God Bless this tasteless British diet - I no longer eat as a pastime, and as such I've lost about 2 stone since I first moved to the UK.

The drinking culture - it eventually got too much for me, I'm a teetotaler now, but before it became a problem, man, what a change. Alcohol is somewhat shameful at home, whereas the Brazilian comment that notes that the majority here 'doesn't give a single shit' is pretty spot on. And there is nothing quite like the great British bender.

I also think the reputation as a cold people is somewhat unfair - you're more 'Northern European' than cold, and once you've broken the ice and gotten to know some one, the people on these islands are some of the warmest, most generous, funny and loyal people that I have met on this earth.

Oh, one last thing. Stop shitting on immigrants so much. It makes me angry when I hear it. It is a such a minority of us that scrounge around on benefits or live in isolated communities. Most of us want to work, want to contribute, and want to become part of the community. When you say mean things about immigrants and paint us all with the same brush, it is hurtful.

I am so proud to be British, and so happy to have had an accident of coincidence that has seen me make this place my home. You have so much to be proud of. It's hard to put it in words, but I feel a deep love for Britain, and such an immense pride in being able to call myself British.",0,1363734032,null,0,false,0,c8yr4s0,t3_1alhoh,t1_c8yr4s0,t3_1alhoh,null,1431639447,21,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,21

I was furious when DECC dishonestly compared the costs of the Severn barrage to nuclear (making the former look much more expensive). And told them so directly. 

I'm a huge proponent of showing the true cost of every technology. That's why I called you out on your bullshit 8yr payback claim. It's only paying back in 8yrs because ratepayers pay for the feed-in tariff directly out of their bills.  I didn't even give any personal opinion on whether this was a good policy. But I'll give you a hint, at one point during the height of the feed-in tariff boom, I was dealing with two distinct sets of people. At the bottom end of the spectrum there were people who only have electricity for 4-5 days a week because they didn't have enough money for their pre-payment meter. They literally sit in darkness or go to bed early when it runs out. At the other end there were people slapping up 4kW systems on 20+ properties because they realised that each system was going to make them ¬£60k+ over 25 years.

true,ElDingus,num30,Sandro,"I don't think you can define it, only interpret it.  I would say that it depends on how much impact each player has on a match, be it noticeable or not.  Bale has had a pretty severe impact on a number of matches as we all know.  Dembele is essentially the frame that the rest of the squad is based off of.  Lennon has been relatively hit or miss until this year, but even when he isn't directly involved in play, he influences how defenses react to whatever he is doing.  I think if Bale had been out for the time that Lennon has been out, we would be saying the same thing regarding Lennon.  Without one of the two (and since we have no similar replacements from the squad currently), our entire game plan looks off.  But it's the same way with Dembele, if not even more noticeable.  I would say that Dembele is the most important, then the combination of Bale and Lennon (since without one the other has often looked out of place), and then most likely Lloris.

This was in 2004 and news of Gerrard possibly going to Chelsea made it in the news all the way over here via ESPN. Tommy Smyth was making the announcement saying that it was up in the air or whatever, but it was obviously huge news concerning a huge player.

So the three of us are sitting down one day and trying to pick teams to support. One of my friends picks Chelsea for whatever reason. My Manc friend gave him a look of disgust, but thought it was a good pick.

&gt;Explain away the playpark in Newry please.

Different issue, whatever the name of that park (and it has always had that name, they only chose not to rename the largely unused park for the time being) those who vote for the parties in that council (and thats who I was talking about) do not support violence, and I doubt most of the council themselves would. If said parties said that they would consider a return to violence, they'd lose votes in a heartbeat.

And besides, if you want to play 'whataboutery' I see amongst the memorials around Belfast there are shrines to terrorists in some loyalist areas too (http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/viggiani/east_memorial.html). By that logic, am I to assume that the unionists/loyalists who chose to place those memorials and in some cases got government money for them support violence? Am I to assume that those who voted for same unionists/loyalists also support violence and murder, and are perfectly happy that there is a shrine to someone who may have played a part in the murder of a family member of mine? I severely doubt it.

First being that they inundated the subreddit in the past to the point where they choked the front page. Everyone took a vote and we got a lot of suggestions to axe those types of posts.

Secondly, they're a needless and at times confusing and unappealing departure from format. Everything that was in this post, for example, could have been said in a self-post with linked images which brings me to the final point...

Posts like these encourage people to take theories and jam them into images to get karma instead of writing out their ideas in a self-post as one produces karma and the other doesn't.

I didn't know how to catch matches so I watched highlights of him and Raul (2 players I tried to emulate on the field) on YouTube. We got fsc in 2010 so I started watching games, which got me to start reading more into the club. 

The team was struggling, and my childhood hero had turned into a massive cunt, but I noticed a lot of parallels between the reds and my long time American college football team, the Tennessee volunteers. Both have a rich history of success and a great fan-base, and both are trying to rebuild back to former glory, so I decided to continue following the reds and really bought into it. 

Even though lfc aren't performing up to its standards, I'll never look back from being a fan. This club and culture gives me sports chills all the time. It's really an awesome club, and I'd give anything to sing YNWA from the Kop with y'all some day.

true,aslate,cnty-england,South East London,"Ok, that is a fair point about our old nuclear plants. Early nuclear, particularly in the UK, wasn't designed to generate power but to produce fuel for the bomb. It's why our plants from the 50s/60s are so terrible, unsafe, unprofitable designs that generated waste that we didn't care about or have plans to dispose of.

But demanding that what we build be ""tried and tested"" isn't exactly progressive. Saying new technology is risky a way to move forward. On that basis we should still be using those electromechanical relays you're complaining about, because we can't trust modern electronics.

Definitely **do not** learn web development. Learn programming, yes, but proper software programming, not web development.

The web development job market is over saturated, there's thousands of people willing to do it for next to nothing, less than minimum wage, and many more in India and China for even less, it's a dead end job.

The proper desktop and mobile application software programming market is desperate for people, with a shortage of 40,000 jobs in the UK, and you can get a job in programming for ¬£80k tomorrow if you know the right programming languages, such as Java, with no qualifications at all, forget Cisco, forget GSCE's. forget A-Levels and a degree, just know how to program C, C++ or Java and you can walk into a well paying job tomorrow, particularly in London and particularly with contract work.

Very helpful to those like me who were wanting to know why the strike price is what it is (well, assuming they agree on what we expect). So we're essentially hedging that the price of energy will rise regardless so that investment can be secured now, and if the price of energy doesn't rise much we'll just have to suck up the 'extra' expense (but at least we're getting cheap energy from whatever these other sources are).

On the face of it this seems like a hell of a strike price though. I mean I can see that energy prices will be rising for the reasons you've stated, however go past perhaps 10 years or so and nobody really knows. There might well be far better wind technology, cost effective generation IV being commercialised, or even  electricity generating GM bacteria. Presumably the strike price is tied to CPI and inflation so at this point it's still as expensive as ever. 

Well, not that I suppose we have much choice anyway. As far as I can tell there is no solid plan B if this nuclear deal falls though. All things considered it looks like we've done alright.

true,Gettingbetter,eng-durham,Durham,"I'm from the US, and I lived in both Reading and Durham for a combined total of about a year and a half. I should probably edit my flair. Anyway, I am more ambivalent about my time in Britain than many other people here are posting. I will start with the positives though.

Trains. I love the trains. Yes they're expensive and some lines seem to be straight from the Soviet bloc (Looking at you Northern Rail), but I love being able to just get up and go somewhere. I have taken so many day trips to see sites that I would never have been able to without them.

The local history and as an extension, the British engagement with it. Time Team was never possible in the USA. I was in England studying medieval archaeology, and nearly every town would have something for me to see.

Beer and pub food are great, if a little samey.

British girls are great flirts, and are generally very attractive. I also love that cleavage is very very common in warm weather. I curse that I was there during the wettest summer on record!

Nice and smart clothes are readily available and very affordable. I love my shoes from Clarks. I got them for L30, and an equivalent pair in the US would run me $100. Men's fashion in general is very good.

Victorian Era architecture in all its variety is simply amazing.

I worked for a couple months at Sainsbury's in Durham during my program, and I cannot stress enough how kind and generous my employers and coworkers were. I couldn't go home for Christmas and so everyone I worked with pooled together and got me a lot of beer and candy so that I wouldn't feel lonely. I have never, *never*, seen such gracious and selfless charity in my ten plus years in retail.

The North in general. It is a very relaxed and open place, and overall I felt less alien than I did in Reading. While there were times that I felt less safe there, they were very rare, and are just as likely to be from me being in a new and unfamiliar place.

Despite my experiences in this subreddit, Brits in general seem to like Americans. Our flag is all over your clothes. You watch our movies and listen to our music, and girls like my accent. It is a little weird seeing more US flags on girls' asses than on flagpoles back home though.

Overall, my experience with the British is that they can be very friendly and kind people, if in a different way than Americans (or at least myself) might expect.

Now for the negatives. 

Reactionary anti-Americanism to be specific. To be fair, for every anti-American I met, 9 other Brits didn't care or like Americans. My personal experiences with prejudice is that it usually comes from people who have neither been to America, nor met Americans before, and so don't really ""get"" us. They have also been exclusively from the south. It's mostly frustrating in that strangers will strike up unwelcome conversations with me about American neo-imperialism, when they are ignorant of the atrocities committed during the British Empire. Finally, we're your whipping boy. It's weird to see how much time that anti-Americans thinking about America though.

The south in general. Get over yourselves. Londoners are especially bad. It's probably because I grew up in the rural US, but I've been to New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia and I have never had to deal with people as rude and myopic as the people in London. Again there are many friendly people there, but I never left London in a good mood.

The funniest thing that gets on my nerves though is that, at least in the North, people stop in doorways. They just stop there and talk. Trying to walk into Tesco while five friends are standing in the automatic doors catching up or saying fairwell. They don't move either. People will step through a door, stop and read a receipt, answer a phone call, or gawk at the rain. I don't know what it is. They can't seem to go through a door without taking several moments to gather themselves.

However, despite all of this, if I got a visa tomorrow, I would be getting off my plane (in Manchester) the next day. I love your country, and for the most part, the people in it. ",0,1363740941,null,0,false,0,c8ytfyv,t3_1alhoh,t1_c8ytfyv,t3_1alhoh,null,1431640534,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Being able to demonstrate evidence of your skills is the key here.  Over the last 2 decades, I've probably interviewed hundreds of software developers and employed at least 50+.  Everyone puts C, C++, Java, Javascript, PHP, Python, MySQL, Oracle, J2EE, .net (the list goes on...) on their CVs these days whether they really have a mastery of the languages/platforms or not.  Additionally, having a Computer Science or similar degree counts for very little once you've been in industry for a year or two (with the exception of corporate jobs for high profile consultancies).

What I usually want to see is what projects you've done and what your contribution was to them.  Take for example mobiledev:  If you can fire up your iPhone and show me a working App that *you* wrote, that's going to tell me more about what you can actually do than any number of courses you've attended or certificates you've received.  If you want to be a web developer, show me your sites.  If I know my job (which hopefully I do) I should be able to ask you enough probing questions to be sure that you did the work, or contributed to it.

This is by no means the only way forward, but once you feel you're at a point where you're competent in a particular language or technology, something I often suggest to people starting out these days is sign up to a site like Elance, and try to win a few small jobs.  Sure, it's not top-dollar work, because you're competing against everyone else on the 'net, but it's better than those stupid graphic design sites where you do the work before you even know if you'll get picked.  Complete a few jobs for paying customers, and you'll have a small but current portfolio, with customer feedback of commercial work.  Plus you can get a little bit of income along with it.  Take that to an interview and you should be able to pick up a junior developer position somewhere.

- Item 10: There will be Border controls

Just because dependant territories don't have border controls, does not mean the Scotland-rUK border won't. Although I am sure we all realise the probability of such border controls existing is slim to nill, just saying there will not be any because some other places (with a different status) don't have them, is folly.

- Item 9: Scotland will not be in the EU

As much disdain as I have for the BT campaign, they do not actually state this. Nor does anyone seriously believe that Scotland would be denied. What I do agree with though, is when others say it will not be an automatic, non-ascended entry.

- Item 8: Scotland couldn't survive on its own

No one argues this with any seriousness. However I will tackle one of the items mentioned in the section, that Scotland subsidies rUK. It may be true, at this very moment in time (by a very marginal amount, at that). However. It has not always been the case... especially when the price of oil was at its lowest.

- Item 7: Defence jobs would cease

Well. They might. Obviously not all of them. Maybe there will end up with more. But at least that 'myth' is more of an actual possibility. It completely depends on the Scottish defence firms ability to position themselves in the market and their ability to sell.

I do however dislike the point of how much defence spending Scotland raises compared to the amount spent in Scotland. It is a union... just because money is spent on a battalion unit in Cyprus does not make it unfair that it isn't in Scotland. Grow up. New York likely raises more tax as a percentage of its population than Texas, but I doubt people in New York complain that their American FREEDOM to makes tools to murder middle-eastern peoples is being spent in Texas.

- Item 6: Dooming England to a perpetuation of Toryship

Although I actually agree with the video when it says that in all likelihood such an outcome would not put England into Forever-Tory Mode... I do take issue with it using past election seat share as its methodology for putting forward the argument for one simple reason. You see, without Scotland in the Union in the past, the main UK parties have different manifestos, different spending priorities, and most importantly - different party members. For example, could Labour have won the last election if it wasn't weighed down by Gordon Brown? Would the LD now be in coalition with Lab? All these factors make previous election results completely uncertain.

- Item 5: Alex Sammond is a dictator

Oh seriously. Just shut the fuck up. Who comes up with this shit, UKIP? I wouldn't trust Sammond to run the country and he is a little myopic in the goal-orientated sense... much like Churchill sucked as a peacetime PM. But I don't trust any politician, either.

- Item 4: An independent Scotland wouldn't have survived the banking crisis

Of course Scotland would, although I severely doubt Scotland would have bailed it out RBS/HBoS rather than asked for assistance or pulled an Iceland. But the video uses the argument of GDP generated per year versus bailout cost. That, wow. Just. Jesus. Countries don't just dump ~20% of their GDP one year into a single purchase on top of existing spending (even if they can!). That type of shit is what puts you into poverty status with massive debt regrading.

- Item 3: Independence movement is just anti-englishness

For some it is. For the vast majority of people, who are no doubt more reasonable, that is just crazy talk. I can't believe that is their no3 b/s piece.

- Item 2: There are too many unanswered questions

Well. There are. But the video is right in saying that this shouldn't change anything.

It is wrong in saying there is a better chance of surviving a future by separating. In general, larger communities survive ills better than smaller ones. That is just how safety in numbers works.

- Item 1: Scotland is full of raving nationalists

Whatever. I can't be arsed with such obvious anger pandering.

----------------

All in all. What sort of stupid shits is this video aimed at? More importantly, what sort of nonsense bullshit is the Unionist campaign throwing into Scotland causing antithesis videos like this to be produced? I seriously cannot believe anyone with any **serious** determination to keep Scotland within the Union would come up with such tripe.

That's just my reasoning for putting Gareth ahead of Lennon. Lloris could be in the running too though, because as we have seen in Europe, our off side trap is about 1/4 as effective without a fast keeper off his line.

If you're planning on spending ¬£30 a week (or ¬£20 with the railcard, which I cannot recommend enough) travelling to London and back, you'll easily make that back on your rent, travel and everyday living costs. Like, on the living costs alone, probably. London expensive.

The sociology department is a pretty big thing here, so you'll have loads of events and shiznit to go to if that's your thing, and there are a lot of relevant societies.

If raving is not your thing, then you'll be absolutely fine. I can list 5 excellent pubs off the top of my head, and those are just my personal favorites. There's also a hell of a lot of people out every night so you certainly don't feel lonely. Most of Canterbury are night owls it seems, and there are 3 universities in the city, so students feel like they make up most of the town.

As far as exchange students go, I only know ones that have come here for their masters degrees, and that's quite a different thing. We do have a college designed specifically for postgrad/overseas students (Woolf) and the university will also help you place into a house with other overseas students if you can't easily find a place yourself. You'll probably end up sharing a house with about 3 or 4 others.

Canterbury is so very significantly cheaper than London I cannot express. Your best bet is just to take the Javelin train up to St Pancras, but if you're super-worried about money there's a cheaper local train that runs from the other station in Canterbury.

Fast forward to 2006.  We both moved to Asia for work/play.  I lived in Vietnam and he lived in China.  The only sports that were on TV that I could follow on Star World (the English cable channel) was football and since we were in similar time zones, I picked up LFC so I had something I could Skype with him about.

I still didn't know much about LFC but I was learning the game.  I had just missed Istanbul so I couldn't appreciate it in real time.  Then Torres joined and everything changed.  I learned the history of YNWA and Hillsborough and Bill Shankly.  I was spoiled by the midfield of Gerrard, Alonso, and Masch (we used to call Lucas the worst Brazilian ever... wow, how times have changed).

But what got me at the end was the camaraderie you felt on the pitch between the LFC fans and the players, particularly when the Kop belted out YNWA.  It was majestic and religious in scope.  

I tell people the reason I like watching live sports, live music and politics because they are the only things other than religion that can bring a group of total strangers from different socioeconomic backgrounds together in harmony.

true,stop___grammar_time,tardis,TARDIS,"In reality, that particular aspect of the Weeping Angel character probably  hadn't been thought up yet. *Blink* aired  about 3 years before *Flesh and Stone*, and it was based on a 9th Doctor short story even older than that. 

In universe, I read an interesting theory on here a while ago that somewhat reconciled the two episodes. I don't remember who originally came up with it, but I thought it was quite good: 

Martha and the Doctor were caught by surprise by the angel pictures in Sally Sparrow's packet, and *those* were the ones that sent them back in time. In 1969 the Doctor destroyed the photos, then after closer examination of Sally's packet, set in motion the events of *Blink* by painting his message on the walls of the future abandoned house.

 He already knew DI Billy Shipton was going to be sent back in time from the foreknowledge in Sally's packet. He then constructed his ""Timey-wimey"" detector to track Shipton down, and helped him establish a life in the past that would set him down the path to set up the events in *Blink*. 

After that, it was only a matter of waiting for the Tardis to show up, and when it did, he and Martha traveled forwards in time to set up the film segments so that they'd end up in the DVDs. Presumably, he then traveled to the present and dealt with the weeping angels there.

Their numbers are significant enough that they upvote each other in what becomes a melting pot of piss (I think Redditors call it a circlejerk?). I really, would not give two shits if the submissions linked to content that was actually, you know, half decent. But no, its always the same steaming pile of facebook-esque shitheap.

You have users, some of which with very little current connection to Scotland itself, posting daily. That is all their Reddit accounts do. Post links and promote the narrative, constantly. It truly is saddening. One day I looked and a good 4/10 stories were pro-independence related.

I find /r/unitedkingdom to be a little leftist in its bias. Not much, but a little. Christ though, at least we have a nice varied mix of submissions, a lot of top quality commentators, and reasoned debate.

true,diana_mn,lfc99,,"I'm American. Born in Omaha, Nebraska. Grew up mostly in Western Illinois (i.e. more like Iowa than Chicago). Currently live in Minneapolis, Minnesota. 

I became a Liverpool fan this year. And no, not because of that Fox reality series (but it gets a mention later on). 

Football (or ""soccer"" as it's called 'round these parts) has a weird reputation in America. Almost every kid plays it. But it's not seen as a ""serious"" professional sport, like American Football, Basketball, or Baseball (or even NASCAR - bleh!). However it has been growing in popularity recently, and I decided I wanted to learn about this favorite sport on earth. I figured the best way to do that was to follow an actual team. MLS was out for me because there is no club in my city (and, frankly, I preferred to follow a better league - MLS is just getting started). 

Several friends of mine had started following the EPL over the past few years. But for some reason they all followed different teams. No guidance there. I figured that if I was going to back a team, I wanted one I could get behind for the long term. I didn't want to be stuck following the UK version of the Florida Marlins. So I actually did some research. 

I knew about Manchester United as basically England's version of the New York Yankees, so that was a non-starter (boo Yankees!). I also didn't want to jump on some Johnny-come-lately, cash-fueled bandwagon, so that ruled out Chelsea and Manchester City. I considered Arsenal for a time, and they seemed to make logical sense, but for some reason that club just didn't grab me. I looked at a number of others (Newcastle, West Ham, Aston Villa, QPR, Tottenham, and more). None of them spoke to me. 

But then I came across Liverpool. You know what struck me initially? When I read that the fans sing ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" before and after each match. That struck me as so quirky and yet so deep. So I read about how that started, and that lead me to Bill Shankly, and ""This is Anfield"" (which sounded in my head like ""This is Sparta!""). And I read about the legacy of championships in England and Europe. And the character of Liverpool the city, and what Liverpool FC has meant to that city over the years. And, of course, there was the Hillsborough tragedy, and the way the fans and the team responded that. And honestly by this point there was no longer a real decision to make, because none of the other EPL teams had come close to the kind of emotional response I was having just *reading* about this team (and I had yet to watch a single match). 

So I tell my friend who is a Manchester City backer (not one of the recent sort - goes back to the hopeless old days) that I had decided to follow Liverpool. He says ""As long as it's not ManU,"" and starts singing ""You'll Never Walk Alone."" Coming from him that was an absolute endorsement!

That same week I decide I'd better start looking for Liverpool matches to watch. The season had just started. So I turn to my cable box to Fox Soccer, and lo and behold... this new reality series, ""Being Liverpool,"" is being promoted at just about every commercial break. It's like it was destiny for me to bond with this team.

So, yeah, I watched that silly series. It taught me about the current team. Steven Gerrard, the living legend. Luis Suarez, the family man (funny how that's about all I came away from the series thinking about him). Jonjo Shelvy the promising up and comer. Brendan Rogers, the new manager with a penchant for using ""okay?"" at the close of every sentence. 

And then I started watching the matches. I was intrigued right away, even through the losses (remember I was trying to understand this sport as a total newbie). But the match that truly hooked me was watching my first Merseyside Derby. My emotions were on a roller coaster the whole match. Liverpool stormed out to a lead. And then, to my newbie eyes, Everton seized control by turning the beautiful game into an ugly physical battle. Then came the second half with some adjustments I didn't understand other than that Liverpool was once again confounding their blue nemesis, culminating in a last minute winning GOAL by Luis Suarez!!! I screamed at my television in elation only to find myself cursing at it a moment later as the offside flag was raised. My cursing got ever fouler as the replay showed no such offside.  

Long story short, I had found myself passionately responding to the team I had chosen out of a simple desire to learn about the game. This season has been nothing but rewarding, setbacks and all. I've got a new favorite sport, a new favorite team, and a new appreciation for a fan base that is head and shoulders above any I've experienced. 

**tl;dr** I need to learn to be more concise. But I'm an American and I love Liverpool!",0,1363752052,null,0,false,0,c8yx6gp,t3_1almwh,t1_c8yx6gp,t3_1almwh,null,1431642356,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9

Then, one day, I think in 2008, I was at home sick from work, in a daze dozing in and out of sleep in the couch, when I hear ""you'll never walk alone"" coming out of my TV.  I had no idea what it was or what it's significance was, but i remember thinking to myself ""hey... It's that chant from the Pink Floyd song..."" (Fearless, from the Meddle album, if you don't know). 

i looked up the song, wiphich led to a couple of hours on Wikipedia where soaked up a lot of Liverpool history while I was watching the game.  Ever since then, I've been a fan.  Weird story, I know.

Two days late edit:  I typed this after working a 14 hour day, I should've said that Liverpool was playing on TV that day I was home sick, which is why ""you'll never walk alone"" was coming through the TV, which is how ended up looking it up and watching a soccer game while sick that day.

There is an option for a loan to a mid-low tabled premier league club, but I feel as if throwing him into a season long relegation battle may not be the best for a player of his type, as he's more flair than grit, maybe would not get the opportunities he deserves at said club. 

**Rose** kind of depends on the readiness of Fryers to be a capable full back. Over summer it should be assessed whether or not he is ready for premier league match time (be it limited behind benny), and if rose is the better option of the two, then he should be kept, if not then selling him is pretty much the only option I think.

**Pritchard** should just go out on loan to whomever is best place and offers advanced first team opportunities, be it championship, or league 1, to gain experience/grow up a bit.",0,1363754405,null,0,false,0,c8yxvzn,t3_1airqm,t1_c8yxvzn,t3_1airqm,null,1431642692,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

I was 12 (fifteen years ago), and playing football on a gravel patch in a boarding school in the hills in Northern India. I was fucking terrible then.  

Not having a particularly good grasp of traction and gravity, I attempted to slide and scraped my knee into a bloody mess. For the rest of the match I sat on the sidelines with one of the parents who helped me wash and bandage it. 

He was a Thai gentleman, and a second generation Liverpool supporter. He started talking to me about how often I played, if I saw any football on the TV, if I liked a club, and was soon telling me  about Dalglish and Rush, and his own stories of following Liverpool around Europe. I listened for about ten minutes, and as soon I was able to walk, I fled. 

The next week I went to the Library and asked for a book about Liverpool. I was given one about the Beatles. In the summer holidays, there wasn't much club Football on TV, but there was Euro 96, and Fowler and Redknapp and McManaman and after that I never really thought about it. It was just my club, even though I had to wait a year to watch a live game on TV, and then I wrote to the club and they sent me stickers and a team photograph.

Compared to Adelaide there is so much more to do in London, other European cities are easily accessible, food is far better than expected too. Price wise, everything apart from petrol and car insurance is significantly cheaper than Australia. Houses are admittedly smaller than most Australian ones. Public transport is fantastic compared to Adelaide.

Bug wise, England wins hands down. I was surprised there were no fly screens on windows over here, you guys just don't have the bugs we do which was a nice change. Also nice going hiking without worrying about snakes or spiders.

Weather isn't as good as Australia but is not as bad as I thought it would be. Also beaches aren't as good as Oz near London but when I visited Cornwall I was very surprised at how nice the beaches there were.

The biggest downside in England I find is how many people in England are down on their own country.

true,Inquisitr,tennant,Tennant,"We'll have to agree to disagree because what you just said is completely 100% wrong to me.  All of it.

I think Moffat has been a blight on the show.  I want it to go back to being Doctor Who, not Companion who.  I was so god damn tired of the Ponds that I wish they had left the first time they had a huge emotional goodbye with the Doctor.  But no, then we had to have two more big emotional goodbyes.  

I was ecstatic when they were gone for good.  Knowing they were dead forever was great.  But then we get fucking Oswind, and it's going to be the same shit already I can tell.  All about Oswind and that funny hero guy she travels with.

And does everything have to be some gigantic Lost style plot now?  RTD had those season long arcs but they weren't constantly bashing you upside the fucking head with it.  A sign here you might have noticed, a quote someone said in passing.  

And I liked the Doctor better when he wasn't an Emo fuck.  10 got sad when companions left, but he didn't go run away and hide in the fucking clouds like a spoiled brat.  Fuck 9 saw his entire race and civilization destroyed right in front of his eyes because of his own actions, and guess what, he was right back out there being the god damn Doctor.

And so help me god if ""love"" turns out to be the answer to another end of the world scenario I'll fucking scream.  What happened to you know, the science in the science fiction?  This isn't fucking fantasy, it's sci fi.  Yes, reverse the polarity of the neutron flow, no ""Your love for your baby stopped the cybermen, because reasons!  Nevermind all those other people we converted that loved thier babies.  Oh and we don't need to cut out your brain, just put a mask on go go retcon!""  Instantly made the Cybermen not capable of being scary for the rest of the show.

River Song?  Don't even try to make that argument to me.  In the RTD era she was an awesome and intriguing character.  In the Moffat era she turned into some kind of cosmic whack job who just has the hots for doctor.  It's a fucking crime where Moffat took that character Arc.  A huge endless span of possibilities and he fucking butchered it.

And the music?  You cannot possibly say to me that the 11 doc Era has anything at all on the 9/10th doctor era.  Are you really going to try and say otherwise?  We went from the era of This is Gallifrey, the Series 4 10th doc theme, And the Doomsday theme to...what?  I can't think of a single 11th Doc era song off the top of my head, and that's the point.  Not a single one of them was memorable.  The 11th Docs theme was OK, but just OK, and the 10th Docs was still just straight better.  Gone was the haunting otherworldly feel to it, and instead we got a carnival theme.

The sooner Moffat is relieved from the show the better off the series will be.  RTD needs to bitch slap him and take back the series before he ruins it.

11 has some good episodes, don't misunderstand.  The girl who waited was amazing.  A Christmas Carol was amazing.  But in the 11 era I'm looking for good episodes amongst the bad ones.  in the 9/10th era it was everything was fucking awesome and every so often there would be one I didn't like as much.  Fear her was the exception for 10, not the rule.  In the 11 era The girl who waited is the exception.  Sure you can bring up the Doctor's wife if you like, but that's it's own thing.  When Neil Gaiman is writing your episode it's hard to fuck it up.

You might argue that he could  have stimulated the economy through a tax cut but it is questionable whether this would have worked, and the main issue that he faced was reducing government spending, which to some extent he managed to do, particulalry in the early parts of his term.

Thatcher cut the top rate of income tax from 83% to 60% when she came to power in 1979, but mass unemployment reached levels unseen since WW2 and did not fall below 1979 levels until the 1990s. The economy also entered a steep recession in 1979, and did not begin to recover until 1982.

Thatcher's main concern was, famously, controlling the rate of inflation, even if the cost of doing so was high unemployment. This is something that she did achieve -- mainly through limiting government spending as part of a strict monetarist policy, and by (for better or worse) crushing the unions whose wage demands had caused such problems for Heath and Callaghan in the 1970s.

The nuclear waste issue is really overblown, given the volumes that we're talking about.  We produce about 25ml of high level nuclear waste per person per year.  Given that we manage to dispose of around half a ton of normal waste and 80kg of hazardous waste per person per year, I'm pretty sure that this isn't beyond us.  Nuclear waste is nowhere near as big an issue as most people make it out to be, especially when placed in the context of all the other waste we're dumping all over the place the whole time.  It's a fairly simple engineering challenge, and we've got plenty of suitable geology.

I don't disagree that renewables will play a part in generating energy for the UK.  But even taking into account the fairly ludicrous cost increases associated with the EPR, nuclear should almost certainly part of the mix for any reasonably diverse national energy portfolio.

Thatcher thought that Britain had lost its status as a major world power, and this was what motivated her as a politician. She blamed the trade unions for undermining Britain's economic competitiveness, and saw them as the 'enemy within' who were largely responsible for Britain's loss of prestige. So her successful erosion of trade unionism would be regarded, by her, as a major success. The reason why she wanted to crush the trade unions had as much to do with her political ideology as it did with the economy.

Victory in the Falklands War was also crucial in helping her get re-elected for the first time, and many of her supporters see the Falklands campaign as an important moment in the restoration of British international prestige. 

Whether Thatcher did a good job overall is extremely questionable, however.

In the UK, railway companies were hugely competitive, building multiple stations and lines in towns and cities, leading to huge redundancy and the eventual closure of most of them.  I can easily imagine that a railway's visual appearance was part of that competitive nature.

Unfortunately we went through a period of ""modernisation"" in the UK, where many of these lovely old features were ""upgraded"".  Usually this meant knocking down anything that cost money to maintain, or replacing cast iron lamp posts with concrete pillars.  Poulton-le-Fylde railway station is a rare example of one which wasn't changed much:

true,pagethree,null,null,"A bit incomplete. I'll mainly focus on WWII as a time period in which to establish his time lines, as we know for sure that 3 Jacks are present on Earth in this period. Correct me if I make any mistakes :)

Before he travels with the Doctor, there are unspecified adventures that take place in his job as a Time Agent. We know that he takes on the identity of a ""Captain Jack"" (not him) that died during WWII. When Jack first meets the Doctor/Rose, it is during WWII and he is no longer a Time Agent but merely posing as one (uncertain why he stopped being an agent). Think of this as 1940s ""Jack A"". ""Jack A"" dies but is resurrected by Rose (with the TARDIS inside of her).

The second time that Jack is in the 1940s, it is because he tried to travel back to earth after becoming immortal and ended up in the 1800s (? I think, not positive). Because he cannot die, he continues to live in this timeline. Consider this 1940s ""Jack B"". It is during this time that he is waiting for the Doctor (with 10's hand in a jar). When Torchwood (the series) begins, it is this Jack that we see. Although the episode follows the events on Doctor Who in which he becomes immortal, many many years have passed in between.

After Jack has more adventures with the Doctor and returns to Torchwood, he is sent back in time due to Captain John and Grey. He is buried underneath Cardiff before any humans have lived there (don't remember the date, but thousands of years in the past). Due to an item he has on him thanks to Cpt. John, he is located by the Torchwood team during the late 1800s. At this time, ""Jack B"" is already working for Torchwood. Jack knows that he cannot cross his own timeline, so he tells Torchwood staff to put him in a vault set to be opened in the present (right after he is sent to the past to be buried). Thus, he becomes 1940s ""Jack C"". Keep in mind that ""Jack C"" is completely inactive (other than being moved from the ground to the vault) until the present day, when ""Jack B"" is sent back in time to turn into ""Jack C"".

Hopefully that clarifies some things. Jack is actually older than the Doctor (although the majority of his time was spent buried alive... presumably an endless cycle of dying and waking up and dying all over again)! I repeated the word ""Jack"" so many times that it seems fake now...

* Watching football at a regular time
* Cheap pints (pints are about ¬£6 out here)
* Decent Chinese takeaway

Oh Aye definitely. I'm trying to get on a job as labourer that pays $40/hour (¬£27.50). Its fucking unreal money and its work at the end of the day, back in home town there is fuck all and what jobs are available are really competitive with multiple candidates for the position.

With regards to taking sponsorship and ultimately PR then ... I dunno. Its a lot to live here permanently, being away from my friends and family for indefinite periods of time but I fucking **love** melbourne and the employment opportunities are amazing out here.

I dunno, I've got a year to decide and I plan on going home for Xmas.

The UK is a unique and fascinating country and people don't appreciate it as much as they should. Bad things: unemployment, lack of job opportunities, fuel cost, prices, traffic, the class system, anti-immigrant political climate, cynically under-funding the NHS to privatize it, weather, chavs, unfriendliness, bureaucracy/red tape, lack of space, and house prices. 

Most of the bad things are just annoyances but the real deal breakers for us to live here long term were the lack of good jobs for me and the fact that we will never be able to afford a house here.

They were able to construe a General strike which crippled his image of competency and lead to a Vote of No Confidence in Parliament.

Had he waited, he would have been able to capitalise on the North Sea Oil, which many account as the sole reason for Mrs. Thatcher economic success. Which might sound easy, but the money spent on Britain's access to North Sea Oil far exceeded NASA's Budget to land a man on the moon.

He creates more opportunities for Defoe, Bale etc by opening up the field with clever positioning and zoning.

true,HandyShandy,eng-Surrey,Waitrosetershire,"I think you are applying 21st century reasoning to a 20th century problem. Your question implies that tax was the only thing the government could really change to alter the economy - that is only true today. In the 1970s the government had WAY more control over the economic 'levers'. What happened from 1979 to 1983 was nothing less than a revolution - but not a planned one, the policy was pretty much to throw it all in the air and see where it lands, I get the feeling that is what the conservatives are doing today. Conservatives believe if you remove the safety blanket, then a population will work out for itself the best way to thrive. Callaghan's biggest problem was the IMF loan, and the cuts to spending that it required, can you imagine how politically damaging it was to get a bailout cheque made out in Deutschmarks just 30 years after the war had ended. Those spending cuts led to the winter of discontent which was a devastating blow - inflation was massive, and the pound was weak. The problem for today is that as a manufacturing economy the weak pound and low taxation meant the UK could export its way out of trouble - but today to export we still have to import (so a UK company has something manufactured in China, the weak pound does not make it any more competitive). It is difficult to see a way out.

&gt;When a politican, the 'prime minister' of the area can stand up and publicly declare that no catholic should be given a job

He argued favouring loyalists over anyone else. However distasteful by today's standards, not uncommon rhetoric in the realpolitik of the time. Similar sentiments echoed in Southern Ireland about untrustworthy 'British agents'. Same in USA, etc.

Sure, it being NI with it's protestant majority meant that employers were much more likely to be Protestant, and distrust of anyone outside of a certain social strata meant upwardly mobile wasn't exactly going to happen overnight. But not that out of place for the society of the time.

On discrimination in the first half of 20th century NI, here's another anecdote to go with the long list of discrimination anecdotes used casually in history books and elsewhere:

In Londonderry, there were two mills close by one another (near to the Craigavon Bridge). One was the 'Catholic' mill, one the 'protestant' one and each employed predominantly people from their respective religions. This was the story for many towns in NI - in many ways a duopoly economy. Were such workplaces guilty of discrimination? Undoubtedly. But that was the way the world worked at the time. No fair employment tribunals, long hours, 6 day weeks, workers routinely put in an entire careers worth of work at one employer, things were just much, much more conservative.

In the same way 50 years from now we'll look back and wonder why the Catholic church chose to segregate it's people's education from the rest of society, when we look back at the early years of the NI state and attempt to judge it by today's standards we're guilty of misunderstanding how values change through history.

&gt;when the voting system itself NI wide was set up to give protestant landowners and ratepayers extra votes

Discriminated against Protestant working class just as much as Catholic working class.

&gt;I'd love to see how that wasn't a policy of province wide domination

It wasn't. It supported a kind of small-time ascendency, no doubt, but if someone said to me I'd be given powers of domination over a bunch of people, I'd be thinking great, I'll never have to walk anywhere again. They can feed me grapes and wash my feet whilst holding the aerial in just the right place for Match of the Day. Then they take me aside and say 'er, no. Your council mayor might be a unionist instead of a nationalist and you'll get a few more votes then your subordinates at elections', well I wouldn't be feeling very domineering.

&gt; Human rights defenders were threatened and subjected to unfounded accusations by government officials and the state media. Human rights organizations were concerned that the lack of definition of ‚Äúpolitical rights‚Äù in the Law for the Defence of Political Sovereignty and National Self Determination, passed by the National Assembly in December 2010, could impede their work. The Law bans organizations considered to work for the defence of political rights from receiving international funding.

&gt; In May, Juan Jos√© Barrios was assassinated by two hooded men in Guanay√©n, Aragua state. He was the seventh member of the Barrios family to be killed in circumstances that suggested members of the Aragua State Police were involved. In January, N√©stor Caudi Barrios, who had witnessed the extrajudicial execution of Narciso Barrios in 2003, was left with permanent injuries after being shot by two men on motorbikes. No progress had been reported in the investigations into these attacks by the end of the year.

&gt; There were further restrictions on freedom of expression. In October, the National Telecommunications Commission, the state media regulator, imposed a large fine on Globovisi√≥n for violating the Law on Social Accountability in Radio, Television and Electronic Media. The television station was accused of ‚Äújustifying crime‚Äù and promoting ‚Äúhatred for political reasons‚Äù for its coverage of the prison riot at El Rodeo.

true,YourLizardOverlord,eng-sussex,Scotland --&gt; West Sussex,"James Callaghan just happened to be PM when the car crashed. By the end of his government he was following much the same policies as the subsequent Conservative government, because there weren't many other options. Hence the winter of discontent.

The whole Western economy was in trouble in the 1970s because of the oil price shock, the response of central banks to counteract the resulting recession, which in turn caused stagflation. 

Britain also had some unique problems. 

Industry was uncompetitive due to bad management and cultural disdain for manufacturing. The combative unions were a symptom rather than a cause of this. This made British industry too weak to survive the newly competitive environment.

After WW2 Britain had tried to retain its status as a world power, which meant that we pissed away our Marshall aid. Germany invested theirs in infrastructure and  manufacturing. Which meant that they could out compete us. 

So Thatcher basically continued Callaghan's policies, with a few twists of her own like crushing the unions, lowering the top rate of tax, and allowing industry to collapse faster.

More broadly, she wanted to make society much more individualistic. This included allowing a lot of council house tenants to buy their homes at knock-down prices, in the hope that -- as property owners -- they would stay off benefits and not go on strike. Whether this was a good thing is controversial. The council house tenants quite liked it at the time, but the loss of our social housing stock has led to current problems with immense rents, huge housing benefit expenses for the taxpayer, etc.

...because she was getting inflation under control and dealing with unions - neither popularity-builders, but a curious parallel to events today; in short, complaints about the taste of the medicine somehow being taken as justification for no medicine at all. As a result, sure she was unpopular, but taking that by itself is disingenious - the economy was beginning to recover in ealry '82, and it's worth remembering that Labour under Foot &amp; Kinnock were a comedy act until the arrival of John Smith years later, what with the longest suicide note in history, CND and so on. Even the later Poll Tax, while imperfect, was fairer than the old rates system; but Labour made a lot of noise complaining about it instead of producing any kind of real alternative. This sort of thing meant that Thatcher certainly was unpopular, but it wasn't as if there was any real campaign to get her out in parliament *or* the media back in the early days, even before the Falklands invasion.

then, there is the problem of playing false 9 or anything suitable for neymar, we will need 6 lampard/meireles type players to go in midfield. considering our main force is in attacking playmakers, this will be a challenge. we don't have enough players for that formation.

Considering we need someone like drogba first, signing neymar will be bad move. you said it yourself, that he is good at dumping the ball to center. we already have those players. we need someone who can finish those balls. ba/lukaku are looking good, but still need a lot of time to prove themselves. signing neymar will take a lot from transfer budget, which we need to improve other areas. attacking midfield is already packed with talent, so touching it will be senseless. 

 trio of ba/lukaku/falcao will be much better striking option for us. Although, we can go for a new defender too. Cole and terry will be gone soon, so they need replacement fast enough. Cahill/Luiz/Iva are not enough for 2 spots.

Statistically speaking, you are likely to be an idiot. I don't know how much empirical evidence you have presented to make the case for it though. 

Since you raise the issue, I think it is very simplistic to state that you are an idiot because you invest in capitalist business. 

On one hand, if someone willingly participates in a system which is benignly enslaving them and slowly but surely destroying the natural environment upon which they depend, the ""idiot"" label might seem apt. 

At the same time, when you consider the money and effort invested in priming the ""idiot's"" perspective to think of the negative system as positive, it's not so easy to just call them an idiot. There are degrees of lack of self-awareness, social conditioning, peer pressure, ummm, competitiveness, greed, fear, desire to conform, all sorts of ""Freudian"" shit and so on which prevent someone from seeing the blatant reality in which they stand. 

Under such circumstances, it would be hard to seriously call anyone an ""idiot"". Where people have allowed themselves to believe they have free will or an open mind, it's even more tragic.

I lived here once before in 1998. I worked in the Home Counties as an engineer and I'm now doing much the same work as I did back then.

The wages here are abysmal, and due to the weak English pound, it's even worse from my perspective. I'm working for the same hourly rate. i.e. I'm working on 1998 wages. Fulltime wages look to be about the same as back then as well.

But the cost of housing has more than doubled in the meantime.

I don't see why any foreign engineer in their right mind would come and work here from overseas. I can get a better wage in Europe. US wages for engineers are about double what they are here, same in Australia. This is mostly due to the weak GBP/exchange rate.

I believe the only way this country is ever going to recover is by being the best engineering country in the world (again).

I think Agger is probably not vocal/commanding enough, that's why Carra needs to be introduced over Skrtel to shout at the back line. But he might make a good choice since he's obviously experienced, captaining Denmark.

Sometimes during games I see Reina shouting at the defenders, probably to stay focused, mark your man, etc. He seems pretty commanding, from what I can see. And I think we definitely need a vice-captain either in the back 4 or the goalkeeper, to make sure everyone is focused and we don't concede stupid goals. But he can't run up to talk to the referee or something like that.

Lucas is okay too, he's done awesome for us so far but I don't feel like he's a ferocious character that will instil fear in both the opposition and the referee - you can see how the Carra and Gerrard talks to the ref sometimes to sort out certain situations. Lucas is like a quiet gentle giant.

Suarez will be a good choice too, both as a gesture to recognise him and because he does seem to communicate quite a bit. But I don't think referees will really respect his words just because of his reputation and stuff like that.

Put together a decent CV. At 17 it'll be light, but put down anything that would attract an employer to you over anyone else. Clubs you might be part of at school, any volunteering, skills and hobbies, and obviously what you're currently studying. Don't make it more than two pages and make sure it's laid out nice. Everyone has access to MS Word and that has some clean templates you could use. 

Once you've got your CV send it to everyone as well as personally dropping it off and handing it to managers of stores. Be bold, be confident.

More importantly, don't limit yourself to Sutton. Croydon is just a bus journey down the road and a lot bigger. 

Don't limit yourself to retail either. You could also try talking to Sutton Council who will run various activities for younger children and will need older kids to help. My brother in law coaches football to children with learning disabilities part-time whilst he's at university, and he's been doing it a good few years. Good pay, regular work, and it's character building. 

Bear in mind that there are eleventy-seven other kids trying to get jobs, so be polite, presentable, and make sure any covering letters you send are proofed before they go out, so you pick up on mistakes like ""pet time job"". 

Persistence and law of averages means that eventually you will be successful. Do make an effort to get a job in the next couple of months else you'll be competing for the few summer jobs with a lot more kids.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;You mean like Cameron and Clegg produced detailed policies before they were in power?

Once they did, people started listening to them - quite straightforward, really. I've just been into the Canteen at work, where they have a TV up with BBC news on all day; it's currently focused on the commons, and what is Milliband doing? Grandstanding and Haranging the Tories over the 50p rate - you know, the one Labour introduced that was easily avoidable and so didn't amount to much more than a lame vote-winner. This is exactly what I'm talking about - lots of shouting, little (if any) progress.

&gt;By the way, I'm with Kinnock on the Poll Tax, it was ""fundamentally unfair"", ""divergent from democracy"" and ""inefficient and expensive to operate"". 

Then maybe you can address the points he failed to;

""fundamentally unfair"" - more unfair than only homeowners paying for everything? That's the problem with using words like 'fundamental'.

""divergent from democracy"" - and yet his party didn't get rid of it or at least call a vote on the matter once in power.

""inefficient and expensive to operate"" - to which he had *no alternative suggestion* - and that's before we apply that summary fairly accurately to the national utilities he was against privatising.

And in any case, this would be the same Kinnock that went on to be the sole member of the EU commission that a) was unaware of any financial wrongdoing (despite every member being at it) and b) spent a good long while blocking any investigations into the financial irregularities. Yeah, just the sort of person suited to leading the country.

&gt;A complete and utter disaster for the country.

true,steve__,uk,Jarrow,"&gt;So you have a cycle - people in council houses can buy then and the proceeds used to build new ones.

The proceeds of the scheme were not used to build more houses.  Councils were actually restricted from doing so, resulting in a lack of housing stock.  It was only until Labour regulated the scheme (far too late in to their time in office unfortunately) that councils were allowed to rebuy housing from tenants who wished to resell.  This was a far better solution as building more houses simply isolates areas of poverty.  However, building more houses at the time would have at least helped.

&gt;I disagree, politicians cannot be held to account for everything because at the time things can seem different. Brown selling the gold off was a bad idea in hindsight but at the time wasn't quite as controversial as it is now.

I respectfully disagree considering the extent of the problem.  I am of the opinion that government should implement policy that is accounted for well beyond their time in office.  We will have to agree to disagree.

Here's what worries me.

If something really extreme or unusual had happened, and the government decided to use a retrospective law change to deal with it, we might not all agree with it, but at least we would be confident that it isn't something that is going to happen very often.

But this was a run-of-the-mill, minor government cock up. Job Centre staff got a bit over enthusiastic, some people were talked into working for free for a few weeks, some missed out on other opportunities (probably the worst part), and now they deserve compensation.

1. He's enjoying his football and progressing hugely year after year at Spurs as a player. This seems to be the most important thing to Bale is forward movement in his abilities. This year under AVB he's been granted a more important role in the center and has developed into a regular goal scorer. If he truly wants to continue to progress at the same speed, Tottenham is his best bet for the time being.
2. He just had a baby. Does he really want to put up with moving?
3. He's very close with his family in Wales. Apparently he visits them regularly and they have been encouraging him to stay in the UK for now for both professional and personal reasons.
4. He's THE STAR at Tottenham. The entire team trusts Gareth to put the ball in the net if the game is on the line. This is huge for his confidence. You must be joking if you think PSG (Zlatan's ego would eat Bale alive) or Real would give him the same support.
5. Spurs are a huge up and coming club in Europe. We've got a sound manager, some very young quality players and a fantastic fan base. If we win Europa and qualify for CL we will surely attract some more good players. If everything goes how it should Spurs could be a top club in both England and Europe, so why leave with all that potential!

My first hand experience of applying for DWP vacancies has shown me otherwise. The literacy and numeracy tests were retard simple yet people who made it through to interview and subsequently onto job waiting lists were complaining about how hard they were and they didn't have enough time to answer all the questions. I aced both and had so much time that I went through both of them twice. I'm no rocket scientist. 

&gt;  No one I have ever encountered tries to do as little work as possible.

Plenty of council workers do. You can see them every single day in my county trundling between jobs on main roads with a 60MPH at 30MPH - taking an hour for breaks when they get 30 minutes, parking up in a layby a mile from the depot an hour before the end of shift...

&gt;  No one is unsackable.

My brother was a manager for a council in London and disagrees with that wholeheartedly. One of the reasons housing benefit claims are so behind is because those departments are staffed with incompetent halfwits who manage to avoid being sacked because they call in the unions at every opportunity.

&gt;  So not only have I earned less based on inflation, my take home pay pay has actually gone down.

In my former career the hourly pay for jobs being advertised is now down to 2001 levels, the hourly rate advertised being ¬£2-¬£3 lower than it was in 2008. That's not just a ""cost of living"" cut and its not a cut because they're paying more into a pension than they were because they don't get a pension.

I can only go on what I see with my own eyes, have witnessed personally  and what I am told by those whom I trust.

true,Cepheid,cnty-uk,Nomad,"Not everyone who is unemployed is on JSA, many are not eligible/it's not worth it.

Anecdote time!

My girlfriend was unemployed for 3 months recently and didn't even bother applying, in a lot of circumstances it isn't worth the hoops to jump through, and can honestly actually hurt your prospects, even worse considering she lived with me and I was earning a reasonable wage.

A year ago in a separate period of unemployment they demanded she go on the Tesco slave scheme on threat of removing unemployment benefits for ""experience"" despite having 3 years experience in Morrisons when she was doing A-Levels.

Luckily she found a job in her field, she went for a work experience with the prospect of hiring at the end, and they actually *took away her JSA* for finding work experience in her field and refusing to do the Tesco scheme. The biggest kick in the teeth: she was hired after 2 weeks of work experience. 

In summary, she found herself a job and had JSA stopped during a work experience trial period because she refused to do unpaid work for Tesco because she already has 3 years of supermarket paid experience on her CV.

They despise people with qualifications and hireable skills, their attitude tends to be ""Why haven't you found a job yet?"".

Even the most hireable of people won't find a job instantly, and just because you have hireable skills, it doesn't mean you don't need that ¬£50 a week.

I don't get lucky. Everything that I have and have achieved has been through graft. I've not had family to help me with money, nobody has given me a free ride. 

I had nothing but hindering all my formative years growing up in abject poverty that would see you taken into care nowadays so I had to fight for  and work for everything I've had. At 10 years old I was working earning money on a weekend during the holiday season. There wasn't thousands of pounds given to parents simply for having children or having a low income as there is now. The only thing I wasn't hindered in was education.

Maybe if more people weren't used to getting an easy ride and stuff relatively speaking handed to them on a plate they'd be better prepared to put in the effort required for when times are hard.

true,OptioMkIX,null,null,"Well after this budget I'm convinced that A) Osborne is living in some kind of heroin inspired hallucinogenic alternative reality and B) my current life plans to emigrate are as sound as any future that I could make in this country.

Simply put, it doesnt add up - and there are signs of real desperation.

1) Growth, or the lack of it.

In the same speech, George would have us not only take in the news that the expected growth for 2013 is only 0.6%, but that the projected growth for 2014 is 1.8%, which is frankly meteoric and completely divorced from reality.

Its only a pity that its only four months since the last ""concrete"" prediction of 1.2% growth for 2013 and 2% growth in 2014 given at the time of the autumn statement.

**In other words, in four months the expected growth for the UK economy in a year has been slashed in half. HALF.**

2) Corporation tax and avoidance.

So apparently from 2015 corporation tax is going to be 20%, although the budget 2011 had a 1% per year reduction so that in 2015 the tax rate would be 22%. This has been cut another 2%, betraying (I think) increasing panic.

A ""crackdown on tax avoidance"" is in name only - aiming to bring in ¬£4.6Bn in the next four years is fucking *paltry* compared to the tax bills that have been evaded by Amazon, Starbucks and the like by filtering their revenue through the intellectual property subsidiary licensing scam, allowing them to create vast losses on the balance sheet while still crowing about increasing profits to their shareholders. 

3) Increase in personal allowance.

Already scheduled, but brought forward - and arguably swallowed many times over by rising costs of living, declines in public services and support (CAB cuts for example) and less of an impact due to wage/salary stagnation.

4) Borrowing is up, shitty wordplay hiding problems.

We're borrowing more, ¬£6bn more in fact this year than projected. By 2017, debt is going to be 85.7% of GDP compared to 75.9% in 2012. The good news is that Osborne is ""paying down the defecit"" or basically throwing money at the proportion of debt accumulated by interest.

5) More money to housing buyers.

Basically throwing money to people who already own houses, and the people that buy and sell them. Loaning 20% of the value(600k limit) of a house to ANYONE who can stump up 5% (along with the normal credit checks) is a large promise to make, and a large amount of profit to be made as people raise the asking price artificially to get that increase in money.

That the second part of this program is ¬£130bn in government backed mortgage help is godawful, leaving us exposed to a housing bubble like that in the US - except instead of private debt, it is government debt that would be suddenly taken on.

Thought experiment time: Government guarantees large value mortgage. House prices rise because people know they can get more cash for their sale. 

The sellers profit immediately, by a fucking large margin.

The buyers are fucked as not only do they now have to start paying that money back after five years, their house is going to fall far away from the value that the profiteering sellers sold it to them for, adding even more debt and concomittant interest - at the end of that five years, they suddenly have 20% wiped off their house PLUS have to pay the interest on that 20%, plus any other loss in value.

6) Supply, supply, supply.

Osborne is fantastic at supply. We've got fucking tonnes of it. All the machinery is there for a liberal economy to take off - but he hasnt created a fucking shred of demand. All these companies and private enterprise or whatever the fuck is waiting in the wings according to osborne need someone to sell their new products to - and currently, it sure as fuck isnt going to be John Smith, UK. Hes got stagnant wages, rising costs of petrol, food, trains, gas and leccy bills and rising rent. 

He's got a lot of stuff he'd love to buy as after five years of stagnant wages, a lot of things have built up. Maybe the boiler needs replacing, theres something wrong with the car and it really would be nice to get a new TV one of these days. He hasnt got a shred of spare money to get this done though. Hes only treading water, not swimming forward.

When Osborne creates some demand is when I'll start giving the guy some credit. Unfortunately all I could hear coming out of his mouth was ""We're going to be fucked for a very, very long time"".

Completely agree about Carroll, having only seen him in limited action, I love the way he moves the ball, almost always one or two touches and he passes it along and moves to get open again. Could argue no one in Spurs current squad moves the ball on as quick as he does, too much holding of the ball when Spurs are building up and too much static movement. 

Carroll should really go on loan to a possession based team in either the Prem or Championship. Tough to see him cracking Wigan's midfield with McCarthur, McCarthy, Maloney and whoever else in their midfield beginning with an M they have.

true,TJP343,null,null,"Would seriously consider selling on BAE or split his time in half with Rose for a year and then move BAE on. BAE is solid defensively, yes, plays in good crosses, yes but he punts the ball away with too much fequency when he has possession in his own half. I don't think this fits with the way AVB wants Spurs to play in the long run. And if they have to choose between keeping BAE and selling Rose or giving Rose what he wants, I'd say give the playing time to Rose.

He has been excellent for Sunderland this season, talk of him being their player of the year. I've seen him play a couple of times and his ablility to motor forward on the flank and join the attack is fantastic. He uses his pace to recover well too. Also, he shows a tendency to step up into the middle of midfield in possession if the space is given to him and act like an extra midfielder.

Very smart on the attack, I'd say he's better going forward than Kyle Walker and his decision making is better than Kyle's too. Walker hasn't pushed forward as much this season as last(and with Lennon keeping his width, he doesn't have to) and if Walker continues in this way that means Rose could be the more aggressive of the two fullbacks knowing Walker and the CBs will have cover behind.

Rose reminds me of Jordi Alba for Barcelona/Spain in that he can get forward and attack with a decent finish, play smart and he finds himself as the most advanced player in the box sometimes as well. He can be a very dynamic player from the LB position and they should bring him into the squad.

Higuain *could* happen, but only because of our previous relationship with Real Madrid. I'd be stoked on it. Guy is a fucking beast. 

I'd also be stoked on Benteke. He's essentially a battering ram of a CF, pushing the opposition centerbacks deeper, which gives more space for our midfield to work in. He's talented with his feet and can pick out a pass. I think he would perform very well on a better team, and if Villa are relegated, his fee will be nominal.

true,SurrealistSwimmer,null,null,"I think it is but I also think it is very very difficult. 

What you would need is almost a perfect combination - a manager brave enough with introducing academy players to the first team but also knowledgeable enough to tell when and how to use them. A scouting network that consistently finds promising young players. An executive that, simply put, knows how to make money in indirect ways (marketing etc.) but also knows how to spend that money. And a loud and loyal fanbase to pull the team through the most difficult times. 

To find that is nigh on impossible. Having said that, I think we're one of the few Permiership clubs where such a structure is possible. Rodgers has potential. The scouting team is being revamped and the recent signings of Sturridge and Coutinho look promising indeed. FSG have made their fair share of mistakes. Nevertheless, ultimately, they are good business men - just not experienced football men. Applying my own lessons from business here - talent and knowledge are key when it comes to running a successful business. They have talent. And I think they're getting the knowledge. 

All in all, yes: I believe there is an unlikely scenario where it is possible. I also believe we are a team that can definitely *live* that scenario. And I think it would be one of this club's greatest moments if they succeed or at least, in this day and age of quick fixes and short-tempers, try. 

Having said all that, I completely understand there are people who think differently, who want to see this club winning. And I wouldn't disparage anyone like that - they're a football fan for reasons different from mine, but equally valid ones. 

Finally, the current era of heavy investment and a football culture where the *amount*, rather than *quality*, of investment matters most is, I think, going to end one day. With FFP, it may already be ending. And when it ends, the super-rich clubs will fall flat on their face. The clubs with a culture and a structure will be the ones to come on top. I hope we'll be one of them. ",0,1363797870,null,0,false,0,c8z6ipi,t3_1anzk2,t1_c8z6ipi,t1_c8z6868,null,1431646825,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

OP asked us a question and I expressed my feelings - I would prefer it if a billionaire didn't buy us. Even if our playing pool is international, I like to see us develop players. I like to see Sterling break into the first team and, hopefully, stay with us. I like to see Lucas coming into our team as a 20 year-old and becoming the pivot he has become. I like to see that much more than a 29 year-old van Persie rocking up for ¬£24 million. 

True, the Liverpool Way of old may now be obsolete. But, under the current regime, I think we are resurrecting it to the extent where it makes footballing and commercial sense in the present era. I am only going by their intentions, as it is too early to see what the real effects of this are. And I want these intentions to succeed. 

In short, no: I can't define a modern 'Liverpool Way'. But I know what sits right with me and what doesn't. I know what feels like something our club would do in the modern era and things that just don't seem to be our style of things. But, very importantly, these are just *my* feelings about it. I know many do disagree. I know many others don't. But I was trying to answer OP's question as truthfully as I could.

Is Liverpool really a team, or just a shopping cart that top talent passes through until another Falcao is spotted who is a little faster?

What if the owner makes a huge bid that becomes a bust? The owner at Chelsea doesn't give a damn and keeps Sturridge on the bench exactly because he spent so much on Torres. This gets to the even greater point that some owners who put huge cash into a team want their hands in the daily business of the club.

You felt This is Gallifrey.  When you're being shown the citadel of the time lords and it's playing in the background, you felt the power of it.  It was amazing.  The next day people were talking about the music almost as much as the plot.

The same thing with the 10th doc theme.  Take this, after the death of River Song.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncymevPD9ow

Picture that scene without that music.  I immediately went and tried to find a copy of it for myself after that episode.  You feel it, you know it's there.  It makes it's presence known and adds immensely to the scene.  Same with Doomsday.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8DURP5xQCA

You knew as soon as that first beat hit that shit was not cool.

Comparatively I have noticed none of the music during the 11th doc era.  I can't name you the names of any of the songs from the past two seasons besides I am the Doctor.  And frankly they overuse the shit out of that one.  It's not just the Doctor's theme anymore it's his action theme, his badass theme, and his ""we need music here fuck!"" theme.  And even still the 10th doc era had a better action theme, all the Strange Strange creatures.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEcij0ARkmU

It's just not as powerful anymore.  It doesn't feel like the music is an additional character.  I mean I could keep going.  

Timelord victorious http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXev8sJXtTM

More powerful than any song that has ever dared to grace the 11th doc era.  Even Martha's theme is better than any 11th era music.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REwOudgPQTI

So there's that, that I don't notice it anymore.

But there's also that when I do force myself to try to listen to the music from 11th era that it doesn't fit what Who should be.  That's not just the music but a lot of 11th era who is like that.  But go back and listen to those 10 era songs.  There's something haunting about them.  Something otherworldly.  In the making of things they talk about how they wanted the one human voice for some of those songs because there's something haunting about it.  Even the 9th doc still had this quality about it

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;A brand new diesel being as clean as a 13 year old petrol car is hardly impressive.

I think it's actually pretty good given where they're starting from. If you're accepting cars from 2000 on the road then you really can't complain about modern diesel engines.

&gt; Their exhaust, as well as being visually filthy with soot, is loaded with NOx and [1] progress has been pathetic:

That's just absolute nonsense. Progress has been fantastic. In the 21 years in which 5 seperate emissions legislations have been passed CO has been reduced by a factor of 6.3, in the past 9 years NOx emissions have been reduced by a factor of 3, and the ""soot"" which you're so worried about which actually does you real harm (PM2.5 and PM10) has been reduced by a factor of 28.

To call that progress pathetic is absolutely ridiculous.

Now *if* the government is correct in contradicting these numbers, then I agree they should be enforcing legislation properly, but as it is, given that every single vehicle produced is tested on a regular basis to see whether it conforms to the EU standards (MOT), I'm inclined to go with those numbers. That report the guardian is basing its article of, for instance, is failing to take account of the power of vehicles, or their size, and itself references another report which shows a 24% reduction in NOx emissions between 2002 and 2009.

&gt;Petrol's no angel - internal combustion engines of any kind have no place in crowded cities.

Good luck waiting 50 years for utopia there mate...

&gt;But I stand by my accusation that diesel is particularly filthy.

It's dirti**er** than petrol, yes, but it's massively cleaner than it was a few decades ago.

Higuain really would be a massive step up, and if there's any truth to the rumours of our interest or his interest in playing for us, think we should really go for it. 

Benteke because of the promise he's shown and the potential for a low fee. The kind of player we should really be in for.

Really like the look of Son, not particularly as an out and out centre forward but his ability to cover for Lennon/Bale or play as a genuine wide forward if we move towards that system. Our midfield doesn't really have as many goals in them as we probably need considering our lack of goal scoring strikers, and a versatile pacey winger with an eye for goal would be fantastic.

true,antastic,flair5,,"1. Chicharito - Haven't confirmed this, but he must have more goals-per-minute than any other player in the EPL. He always seems happy to play for his club, even though he doesn't get much playing time. I know he's more of a poacher than a target man for United, but he's young and may be able to star in a different role for us, making quick runs to open up space. I doubt Fergie would sell him to another EPL club.

2. David Villa - Performed quite well for Barca in their recent Champions League tie against AC. He isn't getting many minutes either, but as far as I know he hasn't hinted at wanting to leave Spain. Also able to provide wide cover. He would be my #1, but somehow he seems even less likely than Chicharito.

3. Benteke &amp; Ricky Lambert - Lots of love for Tekkers here, and I'd love to sign him, but he's young and inconsistent, so signing him would leave us in need of a significantly cheaper strike option who scores lots of goals. Lambert performs well for Southampton, and I think he'd rise to the occasion in a bigger pond, plus he'd be dead cheap. 

Benteke alone isn't what we need. I'd love to throw around names like Cavani and Mario Gomez, but I just don't see it happening (maybe just so long as we keep Adebayor).

EDIT: I forgot about Dzeko!  I heard that he's more or less secured a deal with BVB - can anyone confirm this?  If not, he's my #1, moving everyone else down a peg.

I don't need to. Just because you have deniability against any outrightly prejudiced remarks does not mean that you treat nationalists and unionists equally. 

Look at how you softened your tone when I mentioned my criticism of SF. The only provable intolerance defined in this case would be how you specifically created an account because there was an overwhelming nationalist majority of commentary on the flag issue in this subreddit. The fact that you felt the need to 'correct' that makes you a bigot. The problem wasn't yours to correct, you chose to become angered by it, react to it and therefore, are intolerant of it.

If you don't believe me about implications and inference, chat to any equality expert. Personally, if you're telling the truth, I think it wouldn't be a bad idea as your attitude to political discussion is liable to get you into trouble.

true,Ms_moonlight,eng-westmidlands,West Midlands,"A day late, but here goes.

I moved here from the US a little over five years ago. 

The Good
-Newspapers (WOW more than one!) 

-Public transport runs more than once every half an hour

-Ease of getting to other countries

-JOBS. I could barely get anything in the US but if I have an interview here I'll get the job  

-My current job is a great place to work -- been there casually on and off since 2008

-People leave you alone. No one bothers you to death about children, going to church, or personal choices

-School is extremely affordable in comparison to the US

-Fruit and vegetables taste better -- especially strawberries. I love strawberry season so much

-Lack of extreme weather (no hurricanes) 

-Easy to talk to people about controversial things 

-The NHS and dental treatment. Finally! I can afford going to the dentist!

-Specs are reasonably priced here

-Clothes can be reasonably priced 

-The countryside is perfect

-I love houses here (especially those built before 1970) 

-I like TV here a lot

The bad/Ugly
-Housing is expensive and utilities are expensive. Current flat has heating in only two rooms and landlord isn't interested. Husband's family's house has a fireplace and no heating. This means that when I'm in someone's house I'm always freezing for 6 months of the year. 

-Lack of sunlight gave me nasty vitamin D deficiency which left me out of work last year (not anyone's fault but my own)

-Bullied at my first job and at home (not England's fault) which lead to a very, very, bad first year and a hard second year

-People think I'm odd because I don't drink alcohol",0,1363806496,null,0,false,0,c8z9oxo,t3_1alhoh,t1_c8z9oxo,t3_1alhoh,null,1431648395,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6
true,pramirez184,lfc12,,"&gt;For one, player turnover will rise.

One of the main reasons I became attracted to Liverpool was because of the stalwarts like Gerrard and Carragher. They have been with the club forever, and i can see the passion they have for the club. 

Now, I am watching some of the newer guys like Henderson, Sterling, and even Downing grow into their own, and it has been an absolute joy to watch this. I feel somewhat attached to these guys since I remember their struggles that were not that long ago. As they are gaining form and the fan base is getting behind them, I can see the love they have for the club that is standing by them even if they struggle. You don't have to look any farther than Lucas to see what I'm talking about. 

This wouldn't happen if the owners were like Chelsea's as these guys would have immediately been discarded or replaced. To me, the guys at clubs run by megarich billionaires seemlike they are playing more for the name on the back of their shirts than the crest on the front.

Another Serie A attacker who we showed minor interest in the last few years but has since fallen under the radar.

Morse cowed

A REMARKABLE email from former HM Revenue &amp; Customs boss Dave Hartnett to senior colleagues reveals a major cover-up by Amyas Morse (pictured), head of the National Audit Office and the man trusted by parliament to investigate allegations of wrongdoing in Whitehall. The email poses serious questions over Morse's suitability as auditor-general and Britain's principal public spending watchdog.

When the Eye exposed dodgy tax deals given by Hartnett to Vodafone and Goldman Sachs, MPs on the public accounts committee demanded answers. Failing to receive any from the stonewalling taxman, at the end of 2011 committee chair Margaret Hodge instructed Morse's NAO to investigate five specific deals, including these two, with the help of retired judge Sir Andrew Park.

The most important allegation was that Vodafone's multi-billion-pound offshore avoidance dispute had been settled in 2010 by Hartnett for a paltry amount without even consulting lawyers and specialists in the law concerned. What was more, Hartnett and his chief lawyer Anthony Inglese had repeatedly and entirely inaccurately claimed to MPs that ""lawyers were involved throughout"".

To resolve this and other matters, Park would examine the cases and report to the NAO, which would deliver the objective findings to Hodge's committee. But days before Park set to work, on 15 December 2011 Hartnett and Morse convened a private meeting. It evidently went well for Hartnett, who straight away afterwards blurted out an email to several senior colleagues, including Inglese, declaring the meeting ""useful and interesting"". In it he revealed that Morse ""told me that he has made clear to the NAO tie his subordinates] that his expectation is that nothing of substance will be found in the review"".

This blatant prejudicing of his own investigation was in keeping with Morse's long-standing desire not to rock the boat. When MPs first raised the Vodafone scandal in November 2010, Morse had told them it ""wasn't very likely"" the settlement had been ""unreasonable"", the key word in determining whether Hartnett would suffer the disaster of having his department's accounts ""qualified"" because of his actions (see Eye 1276).

""Amyas reminded me that he himself was at one time a tax partner (as an accountant) and dealt with many significant issues without legal support,"" confided Hartnett's email. This was irrelevant to a multi-billion-pound dispute turning on a point of law recently dealt with in both the English appeal "" court and the European Court of Justice, but it betrayed Morse's intentions. Hartnett also revealed that Morse was to send him a draft of his terms of reference for his comments before the investigation started ‚Äî a decidedly gentlemanly way to begin an investigation.

Six months later Morse duly concluded that the dodgy deals were ""reasonable"", despite the fact that Park confirmed all the failings the Eye had identified. But the judge's findings were filtered through Morse and his team, who transformed the failures into something ""reasonable"" (in the Goldman Sachs case, bizarrely because HMRC's unlawful ¬£20m interest let-off would have helped in ""normalising the relationship"" between the Great Vampire Squid and the Revenue). In his email Hartnett also reveals: ""Amyas told me that the PAC was relying heavily on advice/ evidence from"" two named sources, breaking a crucial confidence with the MPs who need to talk openly with the auditor-general without fear that he'll snitch the details to the government departments he should be auditing.

Small wonder Hartnett headed his revelatory email PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL ‚Äî PLEASE DO NOT PASS ON TO ANYONE WITHOUT COMING BACK TO ME.

Hartnett is now ""retired"" to the welcoming embrace of HSBC and it can't come back to him. But by killing an inquiry demanded by parliament, Morse might just feel a rebound of his own very soon.

* **Carrots:** I buy 5KG bags [picking one up tomorrow evening as it happens] for ¬£1.50. I'm not sure how many carrots are in each bag, but it'll work out to less than seventeen pence per carrots - at a very conservative estimate there's thirty in each bag; so that works out to five pence per carrot.

* **Potatoes:** 2.5KG bag costs me ¬£1.00. Again I'd need to open one up to see exactly how many are in each bag, but let's say fifteen potatoes? That's about seven pence.

Salmon I can't comment on as I've never liked fish.

So - as an example? Carrot, Coriander, and Orange Soup?

* 4 Carrots: Twenty Pence.
* Tablespoon of Coriander: I buy 500G for ¬£1 - so say three pence?
* Juice from a fresh orange: I pay ¬£1.00 for twelve; so eight pence.
* Stock cube [I do make my own every once in a while, but mostly use Stock cubes]: I buy the basic ones [which, it has to be said, are ridiculously unhealthy, as they're loaded to the hilt with Sodium] one pence [1.5p now, as the price has just gone up].

Total cost: About thirty two pence. If you add on fresh coriander and herbs that still comes in at less than forty pence.

* Onions: 5KG costs me .99. Which on a pence / KG scale is expensive compared to the bigger bags, but 5KG is more than enough for me.

A cheap house in Cirencester goes for about ¬£180K, so a 20% deposit will be ¬£36K. So... in 12 years of saving might just be able to buy him a home... maybe. Traditionally I would have said don't worry because your pay will probably go up each year... but inflation is so high and pay rises are so small right now it's entirely possible you could end up struggling as time goes on. Remember as well, that buying a house is fairly cheap to begin with but after 5 years or so the interest rates usually kick in and your mortgage repayments could outstrip your salary.

true,formercedric,lincolnshire,Lincolnshire,"Ideological disagreement is in principle. Many people don't like the idea of healthcare being run for profit. 

Other people disagree with it by looking at the utterly disgraceful track record of all the healthcare companies now vying for the scraps of the NHS. Serco, Virgin Care, Harmoni, and others all have skeletons in their closets, as well as many public debacles to add to the list. It is the height of naivete to think that we can simply replace the provision of healthcare in this country with private enterprise without any bad sides whatsoever. 

A lot of people are thoroughly outraged that we are dismantling an institution that has served us well for seventy years so that we can sell it off to a bunch of profiteering tax-dodging vultures, without any of us even having a say. 

The ideological circlejerking going on in this thread is from free market idealists who seem to believe that by replacing public with private we'll end up with a healthcare system as efficient as France's or Germany's. Perhaps they should look at how healthcare actually works in those countries and others before being so quick to jump on the bandwagon. Patients are often made to pay up front for consultations, treatment, outpatient services, prescriptions; they are legally obliged to pay for insurance; and they all spend about twice as much on healthcare as we do over here. If that all sounds great to you then by all means advocate for it. But do so knowing the facts, instead of simply parroting ""but Germany does it like that!"" as if it's an argument worth listening to.

I think at the moment the UK is on the wrong side of the Laffer Curve for corporation tax, and if we reduced it like the government intends to then it's possible the government may actually end up raising more tax from it.
This is because it won't be so worthwhile companies spending millions on clever accountants and lawyers to dream up schemes to avoid paying tax, and it will also mean they can employ more people and invest more meaning more income tax gets paid and more VAT gets paid when more employed people buy more stuff.


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_the_United_Kingdom#Residence_and_domicile

For those who are interested what the ""Laffer Curve"" is, it is a basic economic theory (although I would say it's a fact), that says there is an optimum percentage at which a government will get the most tax income, and anything above that percentage will result in the government getting less tax, and anything below that percentage will result in the government getting less tax. So for example if a government taxes at 0% it will get 0 income, and if it taxes at 100% it will get zero or very low income, and so the optimum is somewhere in between that. Of course the optimum is different for every place and country, and so when drawn on a graph the actual Laffer Curve peaks at different points of different countries, and it isn't usually a smooth curve.

I had someone else drive and I sat in the boot for a few hours whilst going through the barrier and onto the train and off the other side. They don't really check personal cars, and you have a 0.001% chance of being caught, it's very simple and easy. Will cost you about ¬£80 for the EuroTunnel ticket, plus whatever expenses your friend who drives occurs.

The other way is to hire a small boat from any port (incredibly easy to do), and then just sail to a small French port at the shortest point between the two countries. If you hire a powered boat you could probably do it yourself, although having someone with experience with you would probably help. You are supposed to report to the harbour master when you dock somewhere, and present your passport, but noone does that.

true,EJR94,lfcflame,,"We looked lazy and underprepared. Southampton are one of the better teams that got promoted. They clearly favour attack over defence so the best plan would've been to crush them early on. High energy and tempo and we would've exposed their poor defensive ability. Smaller teams realise that its best to attack a teams weakness, I believe we were arrogant and just tried to play our game instead of trying to expose their weaknesses. Southampton also rarely come back into games, the first goal was key and yet we didn't push hard enough for it. Rodgers should've looked at Southampton and realised what a threat they oppose when attacking us and should've prepared the team to challenge their back four. We deserved to lose and I hope we learn from this mistake.

You'd never think it with all the screaming about 'green taxes' etc in the papers. 

I digress, when you say solar would be cheaper, it depends in what context. Certainly at that price, large users (big offices, warehouses and factories) solar would hit grid-parity. They would be able to mop up excessive daytime production. It's much more complicated in homes. With a 3kW+ system you're generating huge surpluses in the day when consumption is very low. Then nothing at night when you need it. This results in an average of 75% of your power over an annual basis being exported. That's why (without the feed-in tarif) solar will only save you around ¬£100/yr on your bill, hence the massive paybacks I was talking about earlier. 

I haven't done the sums for grid parity on domestic solar in the UK, net metering would be a good step, or some extraordinary battery developments, without these I have a nagging feeling that it's further away than people think.

&gt; Hi, I'll give this a bash. Before we start, here's an (in my opinion) interesting fact about the Budget: the first Chancellor to introduce a Budget was William Gladstone, who wanted to introduce a paper tax which was unpopular and defeated in the House of Lords, so he decided to put all his measures into one Finance Bill, so that everything would have to be voted through (if they rejected the whole Bill, the government essentially couldn't function). Ever since then, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the man in charge of all the finances in the UK, has proposed a *Budget* to outline how the economy is doing and the changes to taxes he intends to put in place for the next year. So here goes, hold on to your hats people...




&gt; ###A few definitions
&gt; **Inflation**
Inflation is one of the features of any economy: in a nutshell, it is the principle that things naturally get a little bit more expensive with time. I remember around 10 years ago, you could get a can of Coke for 50p, now it would probably be 70p: this is inflation. So sometimes taxes or government spending increase *at the rate of inflation*, this just means that they the rates have been changed to keep in line with the value of our money. This is important, because if the amount you earn stays exactly the same but prices inflate, basically your money is not worth as much as it was the year before!


&gt; **VAT**
&gt; VAT is what is known in some other countries as Sales tax. On pretty much everything you buy, you pay 20% VAT (but you don't notice it, because it's added in to the prices for you). I say *almost* everything, because you don't pay VAT on essentials: things like food and children's clothes, and also books and newspapers. Incidentally, VAT is why in some cafes and takeaways, there is a different price for sit-in food and takeaway food: you have to pay VAT if you're sitting in, so they have to charge you a little bit extra.


&gt; **The income tax system**
&gt; It's important to understand how the income tax system works, because it's not as simple as you might think. You pay income tax in stages: on the first little bit of your income, you pay no tax at all; on the next bit, you pay 20%; the next bit is taxed at 40%; and if you're lucky enough to earn over ¬£150,000 a year, any income over this is taxed at 45%. Let's look at an example, using the current figures (so not including this year's Budget):
&gt; I earn ¬£50,000 a year (I wish...)

&gt; On the first ¬£8,105 of my income, I pay 0% income tax = ¬£0

&gt; On the next ¬£34,370, I pay 20% = ¬£6874

&gt; On the rest (¬£7525), I pay 40% = ¬£3010

&gt; So my total income tax is ¬£6874 + ¬£3010 = **¬£9884**




&gt; ###Fuel, alcohol and cigarettes
&gt; You may know that the government taxes all of these things extremely heavily; in fact, the *duties* on petrol (and diesel etc), alcohol and cigarettes are in addition to VAT.


&gt; *Fuel**
&gt; Currently, the government charges a fuel duty of 57.95p per litre, which means that for every litre of petrol you buy, this 57.95p goes straight to the government. (To put this in perspective, petrol is about 135-140p per litre now [[source](http://www.petrolprices.com/)], so this duty makes up about 42% of the total price you would pay.) And all this is before 20% VAT is added! So where's the good news? Well, the Chancellor, George Osbourne, had originally planned to increase this tax by an extra 3p per litre starting from September, but he has cancelled this, so it'll stay the same. All this means is that if you drive, you won't pay any more tax on your petrol, even though it looked like you might have to. Which is nice.

&gt; *Most of my statistics came from [this article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21858399)*


&gt; **Alcohol**
&gt; As with fuel, you pay some extra taxes whenever you buy alcohol. But the taxes on alcohol aren't quite so simple. Since 2008, an *alcohol duty escalator* has been in place, through which the tax on alcohol has increased by 2% above inflation every year. All this means is that alcohol gets more and more expensive year on year. But in this year's Budget, the Chancellor has removed the escalator on beer, and instead cut beer duty by a massive 1p in the pint. Hurray!


&gt; **Cigarettes**
As with alcohol, the duty on cigarettes is 2% above inflation, and this is not changing.




&gt; ###Income tax
&gt; As I said above, under 'Income tax system', there's a threshold at which you don't pay any income tax. Currently, it's ¬£8,105, but it's going up to ¬£9,440 this coming year and to ¬£10,000 in 2014. This means that if you earn anything less than ¬£10,000, you won't pay any income tax at all, and even if you earn more than ¬£10,000, your tax bill will be a little bit less.


&gt; On the other hand, the middle threshold, at which you pay 20% tax, is going to be a little bit smaller, so if you earn more than ~¬£40,000, you'll pay a little bit more tax at 40%.




&gt; These are the big things in the Budget. But there's more, if you're really keen...




&gt; ###Benefits
&gt; I spoke about inflation above. Currently, inflation is 2.2%, but many benefits, such as jobseekers allowance, are only rising by 1%, which is a cut in *real terms*, because prices and so on will have increased by more than the benefits.




&gt; ###Businesses
&gt; Businesses pay an extra tax known as *Corporation tax*, which has been cut by 1%, to 20%. This is important, because a very high level of corporation tax can discourage businesses from setting up shop in a country. The UK's is lower than many other major countries', so George Osbourne probably hopes that this tax cut will help our economy because it will encourage multinationals to invest here (many companies are based in the Republic of Ireland, for example, because its corporation tax is so low). If you want to know more about corporation tax, [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation_tax)'s a link to the Wikipedia page, but it's probably not necessary to know all the ins and outs.

&gt; In addition to income tax, if you're earning money, you also pay National Insurance tax, which is supposed to go to funding the NHS. But what's important about National Insurance is that *employers* pay it as well. So anyway, the Chancellor has announced that ¬£2,000 will be removed from companies' total NI bills: this will be a big boost for small businesses, who might find that they won't have to pay any of this tax at all, and as a result, might hire more people.




&gt; ###Housing
Because a lot of people are finding it difficult to buy houses, the Chancellor has announced a plan to help this. The government will offer loans to buyers to help them put down a deposit if they don't have the money themselves; and will also guarantee the mortgages of people in these sorts of situations. This latter scheme means that if buyers can't keep up their payments, the mortgage lenders (the banks or whoever) will be able to claim back some of the payments from the government. The hope is that this guarantee will encourage more lenders to offer mortgages to people they wouldn't otherwise offer them to, and therefore more people will be able to buy their own homes.




&gt; ###Government spending
The most important issue here is the pay of public sector (government) employees: there is currently a cap of 1% in place on pay rises -- so their incomes can only rise by 1% at the absolute most, again lower than inflation -- which has been extended to 2015-6, which is obviously bad news for these workers.




&gt; ###Effects
This all sounds great, so what's the catch? Well, despite the seemingly generous budget, the economy is still in very poor shape. [The growth forecast for 2013 has been halved, from 1.2% to 0.6%](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21861322), which is one of those abstract economic statements that doesn't really seem to mean anything, but basically it just means that the economy isn't as strong as everybody hoped. In fact, some people fear that we could enter *another* recession, which would be a major embarrassment for the government. Also, debt as a share of GDP has increased to 85%: this just means that the UK has loads of debt; again, more than Osbourne had hoped. [As Nick Robinson says](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21864685), it seems a paradoxical budget, but we'll see this time next year whether it has helped the economy or not.

true,LST4R,null,null,"1) In first and second year, the work load is fairly light. One or two short pieces of coursework and one exam per semester. Some pieces of coursework are just essays, others are closer to code-breaking (working with unknown languages), others involve acoustic analysis of recordings).
Third and fourth year, the amount of work ramps up significantly.

2) In honours years there are modules for sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, and politics and literature based courses that overlap a little with other courses.

3) Definitely! In Scotland for most courses (including Linguistics) you have to take two additional courses in first and second year. I took Anthropology, Criminology and English in addition to Linguistics. My girlfriend took German, Spanish and Gaelic. Another friend did maths and psychology. Another one did Norwegian and architecture.
In some cases you can keep these subjects up as joint degrees in honours years.

4) Tricky question. If you specialise in computational linguistics, there's search engines and text-to-speech. Otherwise there's speech therapy, research, etc.
For traditional linguists, it's mostly academia or non-degree specific work. Forensic Linguistics is one of the current sexy career paths.

Their national leadership is in the House.  For reasons that I can explain if you are interested, the House Republicans don't have much incentive to moderate their radicalism and obstructionism.

My issue with Moyes though is his sheepish tactics in big games.  Sure we always show up against United and City, but will we ever win a game at Anfield?  I just don't think Moyes possesses the mental strength to coach our team to an actual cup.  

It's a scary situation.  Unless we had Martinez, Laudrup, or someone better lined up I wouldn't want another manager.  But I think that now that Moyes has managed to assemble a solid core to the club, it may be time for another manager to push us to the next level.

Exports are iffy cos of the shitty-ness on the continent, government spending will increase the deficit and consumer spending should be encouraged by attempting to increase confidence and even putting subsidies on some things. But trying to increase investment is also going to be difficult.

If I was the Chancellor, I would try and increase investment in infrastructure (pleased to see this is being done) to both boost spending by creating employment and making future growth easier. I would force banks to lend to small businesses on reasonable rates to encourage investment in capital goods (tools, machinery, etc). I would accept a year or 2 of increased deficit spending as a price for this, on the understanding that debt reduction comes after giving things a kick-start.

Certainly was in the 80s. Back then mortgage interest rates were in double figures so even though houses were cheap to buy, servicing the mortgage actually cost MORE than it does now as a percentage of income.  

[In fact at one point as you can see from this graph,](http://colingreenstuff.org/ukpropertyprices/ukpropertyprices.html) from the mid 70's to the early 90's mortgage payments were averaging 50% of income with a rise in 1989 of up to 90% of income. Currently its about 25% of gross income.

So yes it has been worse in the past, far far worse. 

Your monthly take home pay will be ¬£1245 a month. That leaves you ¬£800 a month to live on.

&gt;I think it stems from people on this site constantly trying to find out what's really going on and rejecting mainstream interpretations of things.

That's a very interesting point to make. I would add that they think they are rejecting mainstream interpretations but they are infact accepting a sort of ultra-mainstream interpretation insofar as the rabid, individualist, profit driven mindset of the old empire has been inculcated into the general public to the extent that the chickens are now voting for KFC.

A significant number of people seem to have internalised an ideology that is destroying it even as they shout Marx and Stalin at anyone who suggests that having a tiny elite suck the life out of everything is a bad idea. 

&gt;It's why you see weirdo conspiracy theories all over the place; people are just desperate to assert their free thinking, or whatever.

At least the weirdo conspiracy theories at least *sound* like they are outside of the narrow box of accepted discourse. It's my contention that, even as it is a wild fantasy, the David Icke view of the world is closer to the truth than the view presented on Newsnight or by politicians. And the David Icke fan is closer to a true story than the reader of a mainstream paper even though the paper has more actual facts in it. 

That Hitler stuff is unbelievable.

true,generic_human_1979,null,null,"&gt; they're employees, I trade money for their skills, knowledge and expertise.

And, frequently, employers are determining that those skills are worth less and less due to being able to outsource the same work to other countries. If people are dehumanised as being 'costs' to be cut, then can you blame them for their anger?

&gt; Maybe they were there at the 3am night times when I was trying to get the job done sat alone in the dark of my home office trying to make ends meet.

I've worked later than that for my employers for no financial gain, and it's increasingly common now that there is very little job security, as people try to gain favour with their bosses in the hope they can keep their job.

The question is not whether employers deserve more than their employees, I think most people think that's a given, the question is how much more? The wage gap in the UK is growing, the top are earning more while the bottom are earning less. People see top earners dodging taxes, paying themselves fat bonuses as their businesses fail, and a general lack of responsibility. This doesn't automatically translate to small and medium business owners (as I assume you are), but people generally feel like they're being treated like shit, and referring to people who feel like this as ""entitled little proles"" is not helpful.

In general, what I think Aazadi is referring to, is that some employers are paying as little as they possibly can. This means peoples incomes need to be propped up with government support to a liveable level. Taxes from people and businesses are used to fund this, but since many businesses do what they can to avoid paying tax (see Starbucks, Amazon, Vodaphone, Topman, etc), the burden is shifted to the tax payers... those who are gradually getting paid less and less... it's basically funneling money from the bottom to the top.
