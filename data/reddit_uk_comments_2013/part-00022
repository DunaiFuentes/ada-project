true,palordrolap,mccoy,McCoy,"Caution. **Spoilers** for people who have not read the Hitchhiker's books. 

At the beginning of the first book, Adams briefly introduces us to a young girl in a caf√© in Rickmansworth who solves all the worlds problems just as it is destroyed. She's a gag character. Someone used to display the futilty and pointlessness of Earth's destruction. Adams gets our hopes up and then rubs in the futility by saying ""This is not her story"".

In one of the later books, he decides to bring her back with ""This *is* her story.""

Adams was well known for not planning ahead or meeting deadlines, and therefore it's probably safe to assume that the intention was that Fenchurch, as we discover she is named, was not originally planned to re-enter the story.

She then finds herself entwined with the adventures of Arthur Dent, making the first book actually part of her story.

Another example includes the sentient bowl of petunias, which at time of invention may have been intended to return, but it was probably not Adams' intention to have it play right through to Stavromulla Beta at the end of the last HHGTTG book that he wrote.

There is also Gag Halfrunt, who was yet another gag bit part with his ""Well, Zaphod's just this guy, you know?"" and turns out to be the architect of everything.

But returning to my original point about Fenchurch, Adams soon realised that while she got him back into writing about universe by picking up that loose ""her story"" throwaway, she was getting in the way of the plot, and so she conveniently vanishes during a spaceflight.",0,1359818141,null,0,false,0,c8830hy,t3_17qoe3,t1_c8830hy,t1_c882vd8,null,1431160981,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

The law about cycling on pavements is quite hard to apply generally, but for the most part it is illegal to cycle on a pavement that is running alongside a road.

If you cycle on the pavement then you make the rest of us look bad.

You do not need lights in the daytime but you do at night, as you seem to realise. 

It's worth noting that all the road laws that apply to everyone else do (for the most part) apply to you. This means that if a traffic light is at red, you do actually have to stop, contrary to the belief of many cyclists. This goes back to the fact that you are a vehicle on a road, and that you should behave like any other vehicle within reason.

1. We have no defensive mids. Zero. None. Ramires is not a defensive mid and we all know Lamps isn't. Both the second and the third goals were a direct result of that. On the second goal Terry felt the need to press uncharacteristically because that simply wasn't happening in front of the back line. Our centerbacks are simply not pacy enough to play a press-cover system. On the winning goal, there was NO ONE there to mark Sissoko or a anyone else at the top of the box. We're really missing Mikel, and probably should have dipped into the market more but I understand that they're probably leaving those funds for the next gaffer. 

2. WHERE WERE THE SUBS RAFA? At least Marin for Bertrand when we're chasing a go-ahead goal?

3. For a 20 minute period we played some of our best football, but we seemed to look our best on the counter. A fucking BLOOTER from Lamps and a world class goal from El Matador.

true,OhWhyBother,null,null,"To those saying Lamps and Mata are saving our season, I beg to differ about one of them.

Lamps isn't saving our season. He is ruining it. (EDIT: Maybe because he wants that record before he leaves?)

His positioning is selfish, his attempts are selfish. His play is slow and his back passes allow the opposition to recover. He can't defend and is never seen winning a ball in the defensive half. He cant absorb pressure. 

He wants to score too much too often and that leaves a gaping hole in the midfield. Ramires (or whoever partners him) gets pulled out of position and we lose control of the midfield.

We are missing Mikel/Romeu/Luiz and Victor Moses on the wings. Oscar likes the central space, and so does Hazard. HazMatCar is a good marketing gimmick but a bad formation, tbh. Cole isn't as pacey as he used to be. Brana isn't a wingback who can cover the flanks - he is a CB who somehow works as a FB. Azpi can play on the flank, but his crossing is shit at the moment. We're gonna suffer losses like these until Moses &amp; Mikel come back.

Not that Moses is super-brilliant but he offers width on the flanks. He can play the touchline something I haven't seen Oscar and Hazard do too much or too often.

Also, Betrand is NOT a PL-level player. AT ALL. Definitely not on the wing. Not the style Chelsea is trying (and desparately wants to) play at the moment.

true,yk3313,present,Gianfranco  Zola,"Rafa came in to the squad with what he deemed an 'unfit' Chelsea. Over the 2+ months hes been here, the whole team should have gotten much much fitter now.

Now he has no 'unfit' players to take away from the fact that his tactics are too rigid, similair to that of AvB when he was our manager. And I have noticed from several games already (none more glaring than this Newcastle one), that our defense make VERY weak clearances, hardly putting their boot into it. This of course is done to TRY and retain posession, but that just screws us over even more than it did under RdM where we either whacked it away, or played it out of defense if we could.

You could see as well, that Rafa was pointing for Ramires to send it back to Cech this match sometime around 70-80 minutes if I remember correctly. Ramires didn't pass back and it released Ivanovic into some great space. Those 'pass back and be safe' tactics from Rafa just don't work with our team and hardly even worked for Liverpool.

Also, whenever Ba is playing, Rafa instructs the entire team to just whack it up into the air constantly. Every now and again is all well and good...but for a team compromising of Mata, Oscar, Bertrand and Ramires... (Hazard when playing, Lampard to a certain degree as well) ground passing should be MUCH easier to rely on than simply thumping it up every chance we have to attack.

Under RdM our defense wasn't great but it helped that out attack was outstanding for the most part. Under Benitez, I feel ALOT of our attacking instinct and flow have been restricted due to his rigid tactics, for the tradeoff of a slightly and I mean SLIGHTLY more reliable defense as well as defensive midfielders.

The players are doing what Rafa tells them to do. Compare how we play when we were under RdM at the start of this season, to how we are playing now under Benitez. When we played under RdM there was that liittle bit of tinsle with us..that little bit of arrogance that gave us that amazing start. Now though...we FEAR teams coming at us...we FEAR conceding goals and rely on the counter attack so often. Its alright so fear Barcelona and Bayern (2 of the 3 best teams in the world right now) but it is NOT alright to fear teams in our own league EVERY.SINGLE.MATCH.

true,Drugba,MN,mongolia,"&gt;4-4-2 would easily work. Ramires and Lampard in the center, which is where they are supposed to play in a 4-4-2, until we get Mikel back.

Pushing Lamps and Rami up that far would leave a HUGE gap between our defense and midfield.

&gt;4-4-2 Diamond like under Carlo would work, with mata at the tip, Ramires to the right (favoured position), Oscar playing deep and lampard to the left.

Suffers from the same lack of DMs which you are trying to cure by playing Oscar in a position he's never played before. Also, Right wing is not Ramires' favored position. He is a CM. He played on the right at the end of last year because his speed was needed for the counter attack, but when we played him there this season, his weaknesses showed as we are now trying to play a possession based game.

&gt;4-3-3 would work, play marin and mata on the wing until moses returns an put marin on the bench. Fuck Rafa could even play Bertrand on the left in the midfield since he loves doing that so much.

We saw last season under AVB that Mata is much better as an attacking mid than a winger. On top of that, this position would have Marin and Oscar playing in roles they aren't made for and on top of that it doesn't even fix the problem as it would still require either Lampard or Ramires to act as a DM.

&gt;He is forcing square pegs into circles.

Pot calling the kettle black isn't is as 2 out of the 3 formations you suggested had players playing out of position.

EDIT: 4-3-2-1 suffers from the same problems are the 4-3-3 and the diamond. We don't have 3 center mids right now.

Yes mata is better there, but its less of a problem than two incapable holding midfielders. 

Marin is a winger, so I dont see your point. I never said anything about Oscar playing this formation, it would be Bertrand, Lampard and Ramires. Play Lampard there until Mikel gets back. Either way its LESS of a risk than playing two holding midfielders when it doesn't work.

I'm going to focus my efforts on the courses with the largest costs, and it will require a lot of research to identify exactly which ones there are.

What we really want is awareness of the problem. I know a lot of lecturers are aware and do their best to keep costs down, but at the same time, there are a lot who don't even appear to consider it.
When it comes to bringing prices down, I have already promised to put our book sale online in my manifesto. The union has literally a room full of textbooks, and they are just sitting there. With an online list of stock, we can make the way we sell our own used book stock more effective. I've also said in my manifesto, that I will praise departments who take positive steps, especially in regards to module readers.

Support can also take a lot of different forms: targeted bursaries for example or support funds.
I'm not going to take a blanket approach to negotiating this, there will of course be nuances, and we're going to work with departments, not demonize them. Of course, the library expansion will help to provide more resources.

You can drive round the ""inner roundabout"" in either direction, so it's best to just treat it as a series of mini roundabouts in quick succession.

That said, most people seem to travel round the ""inner roundabout"" clockwise regardless of which road they use to enter or leave the system which means that travelling round it anticlockwise is often much faster as it avoids the inevitable queues of unsure drivers waiting to see who moves next.

edit: It's well illustrated in that link. There's a line of cars travelling eastwards from the A13, queued clockwise round the inner roundabout and continuing along the A13 on the other side, yet the anticlockwise path is almost completely empty, plus when you get to the last mini-roundabout the rule is to give way to traffic coming from the right, so it's a hell of an effective way to jump the queue.",0,1359830914,null,0,1359831272,0,c88642y,t3_17r0rp,t1_c88642y,t1_c882d0q,null,1431162449,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Fine.

Commercially, the club is very well run. I don't particularly care about that however. I only care about the football, the football decision making and the football management.

As a bit of background, we have a Director of Football and football board that effectively make all the squad-related decisions and personnel acquisition. The manager has next to no input in this.

Let's start in 2010. We let Carvalho, Ballack et al go, which is fine in itself. The problem is in replacing them. Our only signings of note were Ramires and Benayoun. That's it. To replace a vast number of valued squad members. When the board recognised that we were severely lacking depth (especially in midfield - remembering that we lost Ballack, Deco, Belletti and Joe Cole that summer) they responded by spending ¬£75m on Fernando Torres and David Luiz in January. What did that do to fix our squad? Next to nothing - we gained another striker where we already had three (Drogba, Anelka, Sturridge) and gained a centre back which wasn't our main problem area (although we did need one at the time, I do seem to recall).

So in 2010-11, what's the verdict on the squad building? On replenishing the squad with valued contributors in all areas? Remembering that we largely played 4-3-3 at the time, our out and out midfield options at the time were Ramires, Lampard, Essien and Obi. Zhirkov and Malouda did jobs at various times. That's it.

Why did this happen? This happened because of the organisational vacuum at the top of the club. This club is run at Roman Abramovich's discretion. When he wants someone, he does his level best to get them cf. Andrei Shevchenko; Fernando Torres. In lieu of decent planning and decision making, it was instead deemed prudent to spend ¬£75m (of which ¬£50m is definitely wasted, the other ¬£25m, the jury is out on) on two players. What does this say about the organisation of the club to you?

Here's the best bit - what happens to the men responsible for the dismal squad? Nothing really. Abramovich pet Emenalo is promoted to Director of Football and Gourlay etc keep their jobs. Zero accountability. Apart from for the manager. Somehow managing to finish second with that disaster of a squad is deemed to be not good enough for Roman. Who does he choose to sack? Not Frank Arnesen, he's already going to Hamburg having had enough of the way the club is run. No, he sacks the man who dragged that team to second, Carlo Ancelotti.

For the people surrounding Abramovich, for the people directly answerable to Abramovich, zero accountability, zero responsibility. Do what Roman wants and you keep your job. Does that sound like a well-run football club to you?

Will be be undermined by promising him the complete support of the board and the owner, yet not giving him the appropriate funds to build the squad in his image? Will he labour under the misapprehension that he has the owner's full support, alienate half the playing staff and then get sacked? Who knows, let's see.

Moving out over the summer, mainly lots of youth and ex-youth. Zhirkov the main one to go. You'll remember the midfield point I made before, at this time we played 4-3-3. When Michael Essien ruptured his ACL in August, our options were Ramires, Lampard and Mikel. Not to forget an extremely raw 19 year old Oriol Romeu (for whom you have to wonder why he was available at ¬£3m from Barcelona) and Josh McEachran, who would eventually go out on loan. Essien's injury caused a last minute purchase of Raul Meireles. As you can see, the planning of this isn't great. Injuries do happen, but we're fairly light there anyway.

As for the moving out of the old guard, this isn't done in the summer. That would make too much sense. Instead we're going to make two valued members of the squad train away from the first team with the transfer window already shut. Whose decision this is, it's not quite clear, but as we will come to see (with Malouda), perhaps it wasn't Villas-Boas' decision after all. What does this say about the organisational structures at the club? Does it scream ""well thought out planning, by a sensible and rational football policy"" or does it scream ""ad hoc idiocy""? 

There is no plan. There is no idea of where the club is going. Andre Villas-Boas makes mistakes, sure, but there is nothing like the support needed for a 33 year old manager coming into one of the biggest bear pits in football. He is thrown in with his hands tied behind his back and guess what? It goes very wrong. He is thrown out of Cobham with the other pariahs and Roberto Di Matteo somehow manages to guide the club to win the Champions League. However, this isn't a true indicator of the health of the club. With a depleted/inadequate squad, the team rightfully finish sixth.

So who's to blame? Is it Villas-Boas? Well, we've sacked him already. We tried the long term plan and the patience with the manager but we could only really be bothered with it until March. Time to rip it all up and start again.

You could argue that by the time it happened, it could be predicted, but from the time of the first clue it couldn't possibly.  What seems insignificant can later become very significant, but that doesn't mean the ultimate outcome is a complete surprise.  The whole point of leaving clues implies that it ultimately becomes possible to work out what's going to happen!  That very much is what the word 'clue' means!

Abramovich should not have sacked RDM, and the appointment of Rafa was terrible just because of his history with the Chelsea fans.  Even if RDM had continued having results along the lines of what Rafa has been getting, the fans would have at least been happy with having a respected manager at the club, and the environment at the club would be better.  He should also be less trigger happy.  Change takes time, and this could have been a good season to work towards the future, but it was essentially wasted by the on and off field bullshit that has been going on.  I find it almost difficult to see why anyone would want to manage the team now, knowing how bad Roman is.  As good as he is for the club, hes also one of the main problems.  However, what's done is done, and we must look forward.

As for Rafa, he does some stupid shit, but you cant not entirely blame him.  Sometimes, he is at fault by making poor squad choices or subs or tactical choices, but you have to chalk up some responsibility to the players.  We have a top notch squad, and there is really no excuse for it.  It also must be exhausting to deal with that abuse day in and day out - for both Rafa and the players.

Another thing to have to keep in mind that our squad is insanely thin at the moment, and we have had a particularly busy schedule this season.  Right now, we have a starting 11 and nobody else.  When Hazard, Luiz, Mikel, and Moses are back, things will most likely look better.  Having Benayoun and Marin in the squad is essentially useless, as they both kind of suck.  Meanwhile we have Malouda, a quality player, playing in the reserves, and we offloaded Sturridge and Meirelis (both not amazing, but not bad - better than Marin and Benayoun, IMO).  We also have some fine talent on loan, a few of them should have been recalled so they can develop a bit here and help fill in the thin areas, especially since this season has reached the point where it is pretty much a wash.

It was *blatantly* obvious by the end of Forest of the Dead that we were definitely going to see her again.

So with everything we knew about her from her one RTD era appearance, I was personally expecting something totally off-the-wall outrageous for her storyline, and that's exactly what I got. That's why it wasn't too much of a surprise for her to end up being everything that she is. In her case, the unexpected was expected. It wasn't a case of a majority of people saying it was going to be complicated in a scenario where it might end up being simple, it was clearly set up to be complicated from the very minute she says her first ""hello sweetie"".

true,[deleted],null,null,"The Champions League win glosses over what a disaster our squad is, so the board decide to rectify that. A lot of it is positive; we need a right back - good purchase in Azpilicueta. We desperately need some attacking players - excellent purchases in Hazard and Oscar. 

However, where do they fit into a formation? Eden Hazard largely played in a 10 role behind the striker for Lille, yet Juan Mata has been doing that for Chelsea. Oscar largely played in a 10 role behind the striker for Internacional and the Brazilian national team, yet Chelsea already have Juan Mata. Oh well, I'm sure it will work out. They're good players. Victor Moses and Marko Marin are added as depth options. Moses - great signing.

Does this not strike anyone else as having an enormous amount of panic in it? We suddenly realised that we had lost the majority of our mainstays in attack over the past season and a half - Drogba, Anelka, Kalou and Malouda (as he was supposed to leave). We needed a new attack anyway. Could these players fit into a 4-2-3-1? Of course, they're good players. They'll work it out.

What about the asinine double pivot policy? Well, we have a still raw Romeu and in Mikel a player who will be missing for a month and a half over an extremely busy period. Not to forget two players in Lampard and Ramires possibly the complete opposite of what you want in that formation. What do the board do? Get rid of two viable rotation options. Essien leaves on loan and utterly bizarrely, Meireles leaves after the close of the transfer window in England. Why was this done? What was the thinking? Was it genuinely that we would be okay with four players for two spots? Who is accountable for this? Is it the manager? Is it the director of football? Is it the football board? Where is the responsibility? Who knows.

The striking options - Torres and Sturridge, are both pathetic. Torres because he's finished as a footballer at the highest level and Sturridge because he hasn't got the mental fortitude to play for this club. Yet these are the only two options available to Roberto Di Matteo.

It has been suggested that Di Matteo was undermined by the board so as to make it easier for Roman to sack him. He was never supposed to win the European Cup. Just look at the body language when he went to get the trophy. Does anyone else have a rational explanation of why Essien and Meireles were let go? As soon as the ship hits a rocky patch (as tends to happen with Chelsea), Di Matteo is sacked. He is replaced by a man suggested by Director of Football, Michael Emenalo. That man is Rafael Benitez, a man so utterly detested by the fans that they're in revolt. The man with the plan, with the grand scheme of what he wants his Chelsea to look like, sacked the man who had the fans on his side and who had given him all he wanted when he first found an interest in football in 2003. The man with the plan has divided the support with one move.

The sacking is justified by saying that we were in danger of failing to reach our targets and progressing as a football club. A few months later, Rafael Benitez is doing worse than Roberto Di Matteo. He has a worse record and the fans cannot contain their revulsion for the man. To make things worse, despite every single person in the Western Hemisphere realising that Chelsea's squad is utterly pathetic, the football board do not strengthen in January. Players like Moussa Sissoko are ignored in favour of leaving things as they are, with two midfielders for two midfield spots. This is even without speaking of the 25 players we have out on loan. That's twenty five. Twenty five players on our books that we haven't found use for. Twenty five players some of whom could contribute right now. Twenty five players whom the football board have purchase yet cannot find use for.

So where's the accountability? Who is in charge of the squad? Who is in charge of the decision making?

Is this club run like a well-organised football club or is it run like an Early Modern English court, with factions all vying to impress the King? With people undermining eachother in every direction? With shady, unnamed individuals gaining the trust of the owner and feeding him what he wants to hear?

Where is the plan? Are we playing 4-2-3-1? In that case, let's get some midfielders who can play in it, not three number 10s, a Brazilian who is the third man in a 4-3-3 and Frank Lampard, who has never played defensive midfielder in his life. Where is the communication to put the squad together? Where is the unanimity of setting out the plan?

The entire organisational structure of the club depends on the whims of one man and of getting the attention of one man. Have any of you heard of Marina Granovskaia? She's allegedly the most powerful person at the club, after Roman obviously. Remember Piet de Visser? Remember dear old Avram? The owner surrounds himself with people who tell him what he wants to hear. 

That is why the organisational structures at the club are a shambles - because they're run by a man who does not have a single clue about football.",0,1359834033,null,0,false,0,c886xwk,t3_17rcoh,t1_c886xwk,t1_c886fqf,null,1431162832,442,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,442

* They're.

Not everyone in prison is a bad guy, you do realise that right?

Drug dealers being a classic example.  People want drugs, we enjoy them but sadly current laws say we're not allowed to be grown ups and enjoy them without risking prison.  My dealer is a good person, sadly he runs the risk of being locked up for that service he offers.

That's not even getting into children raised in the worst families you can't even imagine, who never had a chance in life, who never had a single person that gave a shit about them, or taught them right from wrong.  

Prison should be about rehabilitation, ~~loosing~~ losing ones freedom and liberty is punishment enough.  Convicts are caged, they are no longer a threat to society, now lets try and turn them into ""better"" people.  Sadly this is hard even if we help them, they end up in the same poor area, with no opportunity and the same people dragging them down.  Stop having a victorian mentality.

There are plenty of laws that will wind up putting people in prison that shouldn't be there.  Which will only grow as private prisons grow and they lobby for harsher sentences so they can get paid.

Look at what happens when you treat convicts like shit (America, Mexico).  All that happens is they do their time and get realised even worse than before.  The same problems, but with a record above their head and the brutal prison mentality they form.  Fuck that.

We can't just change formations and move players around every week. Most modern systems rely on players playing specialized roles and the players need to know what they can rely on their teem mates to do and what they need to do for them selves. To change to an entirely new formation or a new style of play takes weeks to get down and usually leads to really inconsistent results(We saw it with both Tottenham and Liverpool early this season). When were playing 2 games a week like we are right now we only get about 2 or 3 full days of practice in a week so we barley have time to prepare for the next game, let alone, teach an old dog new tricks. While the results are bad right now, giving everybody new roles to remember would be even worse.

IMO, everyone on here is looking for some instant gratification, and with the transfer window closed, there isn't one. The hope is that once our players start returning, they can just slip back into the team, because they know their position. We need to just ride this out together. It sucks, but it happens. The ACON is almost over, and Hazard's ban is done. I'm not expecting a particularly good showing at Wigan next weekend, but following that there are a couple of cup games that, lets be honest, really don't matter, and that will be a great time to rest some tired legs and ease returning players back into the team.

true,[deleted],null,null,"As someone who always won the Pinewood Derby (because Dad knew way too much about Pinewood Derby cars and actually ran the workshop where everyone built their cars), allow me to explain what makes one of these things fast.

Wheels: you want minimal wheel weight and contact surface.  Only three wheels should touch the track at a time, so cut one down to a smaller diameter.  This reduces the energy required to rotate the wheels, as well as rolling friction.

Axles: lubricate them well.  We always used sandpaper to remove any imperfections, then applied pumice and jeweler's rouge for lubrication.  Then, we put the wheels and axles in a molly-graphite mix and shook them around for more lubrication.

Body: you want aerodynamic.  Smooth front and back.  A wedge shape is ideal.  The back needs to be slightly bigger for reasons I'll get to.

Weight distribution: I'll get to them now.  You want more weight in the back.  This is because a rear-weighted car gains more momentum as it goes down the track before the track flattens out.  Note that this depends on the nature of the track itself.  We always drilled holes in the car and filled them with lead, up to the 5oz limit.

A few years back, I had been getting intermittent, extremely painful headaches. After a few months of that, I lost a filling unexpectedly - it was one I'd had done while living in Canada and was pretty shonky, and the decay underneath it was the source of my headaches.

Overnight, my face, from my eye socket down to my neck swelled up and it was clear I had a serious infection (Goodness knows why I'd never shown any symptoms more serious than headaches before, but there's always some bugger that has to be difficult) but there was something very clearly wrong with me at that point. I had an incredibly high temperature, and my BF at the time said I smelt like rotten milk :/

Le BF drove me to A&amp;E. While we were filling out some forms, a dental nurse who was waiting in A&amp;E with a broken wrist asked what was wrong -apparently I looked like a hamster at that point. 

She took a look in my mouth, and said there really was nothing that could be done for the tooth and the best thing to do would have it out there and then. She managed to persuade a Doctor to take me over to the Maxillo-Facial unit and get a dentist there to tug the bloody thing and drain it for me.

I really hope you fee better soon, toothache is one of the most miserable, painful things. 


If it looks like there's an infection please get it checked out, these things can go nasty very quickly. If not, the clove oil diluted in warm water used as a mouthwash is supposed to be very good.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"Ah, there are two major views of why any recession has occured. 

The first says that there's something fundamentally wrong with the economy, for instance that labour costs are too high, and we are uncompetitive. That's known as a supply-side problem.

The second says essentially that the fundamental wealth generating machinery of the economy is unaffected, it's just that the machinery is not being put to use, because there isn't enough spending within the economy. It's a vicious cycle: people aren't spending money, so companies produce less, which means that their workers and retail staff earn less, and they spend less, and so on. This is known as a demand-side problem.

That argument says that government needs to spend money to stimulate the economy by increasing demand, and break the vicious cycle. In this view, both cutting government spending and increasing taxes are counter-productive, because they cut demand. So if you blame the government for smothering the recovery by cutting too far too fast, you can't simultaneously say that the deficit should be eliminated by raising taxes.

At least, that's how I understand it. If you want more info, there's a good explanation in the introduction to Vince Cable's policy paper published a year or two back:

Consider this: children growing up today, when told somebody is married, know that it is a man and a woman. In the future no-one will know what sex your partner is if you're married.

Also consider this: it distorts almost all existing literature and assumptions about married parents.

&gt; I honestly can't see why anybody is opposed to gay marriage since the only people actually affected by the change are gay people who want to get married.

How can you not see the effect on society as a whole? The whole *point* of this is to affect society as a whole. It is an attempt to completely redefine what marriage is. This is hardly a boon to gay people who want to live together - they already have civil partnerships which give them full legal powers. Instead they deliberately want to muddy the bond between two people of different sexes - with different body parts and probably mental wiring - which is a miracle in of itself.

Please, explain how it is different ? It is censorship, no more, no less !

&gt; What am I missing if a moderator removes something on a forum? Well, it could range from deleting some troll comments to deleting an opinion they disagree with. While I'm fine with the first, I'd be concerned with the latter, and you sort of have to put your trust in the moderators to be mature about it.

As I said elsewhere, Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?

Who are ""they"", to decide what I should read, or what I shouldn't ?

Unfortunately, while the WBC and their ilk are obviously a bunch of wankers, shouldn't I be free to form my own opinion, rather than being told what I should view, or what I shouldn't ?

I know it's the same on the face of things, but they are in completely different contexts. Will overly facist forum mods make it so you can't have a freedom to start up a political party, or voice your true opinions in public? On that specific forum, yes, but anywhere else, no. An overly facist government could censor your opinions and beliefs everywhere.

I suppose you have a point with the second bit. I can agree with why these comments were removed, because they added nothing to the discussion, and would have pissed people off.

That is simply insane - if other industries paid out at such a rate a great many of us would also be millionaires, but then our businesses would be utterly unsustainable.

It also leaves banks very little room to manoeuvre in a situation like this. The thought of taxpayers effectively paying the fine whilst the basket case RBS continues to pay out bonuses should make any right thinking person physically sick.

Like everything else, if you wish to pay lip-service to certain laws (regardless of whether you consider them right or wrong), you have to accept that certain OTHER laws can also be broken, ever if they affect you directly.

Think about some of the theories that show up here:

1. [All of the 'Rory is The Master' stuff.](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/search?q=rory+master&amp;restrict_sr=on)

2. [The lights flickering *must* mean something!](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/search?q=flickering+lights&amp;restrict_sr=on)

3. This one is harder to just up and search for, but I've seen multiple instances of people saying that there are sevens hidden all over the Season 7 episodes, and it must mean something besides what season it is.

That's just three that I can think of off the top of my head. When I saw the napkin/death post, those kinds of things are what I first thought of. So I finally just up and asked: why that mentality? What has Moffat done with the story that is crazy enough to justify these insane theories? Next to some of them, a napkin causing someone's death is pretty calm and reasonable.

It's not the same as stuff like this Digby image. Those are subtle references that we can either miss or catch, it doesn't really matter since they have no bearing on enjoyment or continuity. I admit that I escalated the conversation past being relevant to the OP's image, but it felt fitting at the time.

It's interesting to compare the epithets of the sisters- Bloody Mary and Virgin Queen- in the historical context of the religious struggle going on in England at the time. Catholicism lost and its champion was Bloody Mary, Anglicanism won and its champion was the Virgin Queen (although there's reasonable contemporary evidence to suggest she was nothing of the sort!)

When you take the epithet of a famous defender of Catholicism and combine it with that of her sister- a famous victor over Catholicism- and end up with the name of one of the most revered figures in that particular Christian sect, I can see why it might be considered offensive.

It's obvious that salaries will be a huge expense for a bank or any other information driven business, since you have very low physical expenses and most money goes on employees.

The main reason that bonuses are so high in banking is that it's extremely easy to link a person to income generated, and because a good employee can make such an absurdly higher amount of money doing the same job as compared to a bad employee.

You can't expect an entire industry to pay people significantly less than they earn - that's simply not how the free market works.  The right answer is to tax banks appropriately and regulate the risks they take - if they're generating less revenue per employee, they'll pay their employees less.

&gt; then our businesses would be utterly unsustainable.

The financial crisis really had nothing to do with worker pay, but due to an atmosphere of excessive risk taking, economic optimism and a failure by many to understand the true risks they were taking.  Again, it's not the earnings to employee remuneration ratio that's the problem - it's a problem of regulation and taxation.

&gt;  It also leaves banks very little room to manoeuvre in a situation like this

The fine is ¬£300m.  That's absolute peanuts - most banks have &gt;¬£50b equity (RBS has ¬£70b) and billions of pounds of profit. They're paying it out of their bonus pool as a gesture, not out of necessity. ",0,1359847401,null,0,false,0,c88acpw,t3_17rdwp,t1_c88acpw,t1_c889duh,null,1431164508,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

By the time they dope you up on anaesthetics you wont even know what planet you are on, let alone feel any pain or have any of the hang ups about being touched that you have.

If you are really paranoid about social situations such as the dentist, like myself, then just talk talk talk to them, don't be afraid, they are very nice people and normally have children themselves and other people who are very timid, and will be very caring and understand. You can literally go to ANY hospital or dentist if you have an emergency like this and they will help you.

They will anaesthetise you, you won't even know what year it is, then they will simply take out the remaining shards and you will ask ""have you done it yet?"" because you wont even realise they've done it, and then they can look at a ceramic replacement. It's all very quick, painless and easy.

Music and television are completely different artistic forms and have differing effects on people's tastes and preferences. And the issue of deciding whether or not the show is worth watching is irrelevant. 

Simply stating your personal experiences with an entirely unrelated example does nothing to bolster your argument. Also, the Beatles were a hugely popular band and their music is considered some of the best in its genre. Doctor Who is a popular show, but it doesn't have nearly the same amount of fame and mass-appeal that The Beatles once had and continue to have even today. 

Nobody is ""raised"" on art, people are raised by their parents or care-takers and their tastes in art are subsequently affected by the preferences of the adults doing the parenting. Why is it weird to see kids passionate about the Beatles at a young age? Are young people only able to like things if they are forced into it by their parents? No.

Doctor Who, on the other hand, is a collection of stories with morals and lessons, feature a character who, at times, features a god complex, and discusses topics like life, death, and what it all means.

My personal experience was merely meant to show that something *can* be raised on an art form, and considering religion is a largely cultural experience filled with songs, stories, and other things that people would consider *art*, I would argue that the differences aren't as large as people think.

If it's not weird for someone to be completely obsessed with a band at such a young age, it shouldn't be weird for people to be obsessed with, say, Jesus, so long as they don't act untoward to others because of it. Of course kids don't only like things because of their parents, but their parents play a huge role in that child's development. What I'm saying is, if that parent likes Doctor Who and wants to share it with their child, that child will likely grow up watching Doctor Who, surrounded by things from Doctor Who.

That is a rather extreme viewpoint, and makes the argument for veganism being reliably moral laughable when you consider the habitat loss caused by clearing farmland for palm oil, for example. It also ignores the effects of pollution on wild animals.

Like it or not, all our actions have consequences - unless you are going to live off-grid, grow permaculture and avoid anything that came out of a chemical plant, you're part of the 'animal cruelty' problem. And depending on what you buy, where it came from and what it's made from, you're almost certainly part of the 'human cruelty' problem too.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;So it is not worth trying to reduce cruelty unless you can eliminate it altogether?

I'm honestly not sure to what degree one actually is reducing any cruelty, since animals are still required, we just make use of fewer components. Furthermore, if you accept that it's immoral to use animals as a means to an end, then to say ""Well I'm minimising my immoral act"" seems rather...bad. Kind of like claiming that, yes you understand murder is wrong, but at least you only killed 3 people, where-as that guy in the next cell over killed 20! Does that make you better than him? Perhaps, perhaps not. It doesn't in any way make you virtuous though.

&gt;That is a rather extreme viewpoint, and makes the argument for veganism being reliably moral laughable when you consider the habitat loss caused by clearing farmland for palm oil, for example.

Firstly, palm oil is not a required part of a vegan lifestyle. Secondly, while habitat loss is deeply saddening, I'm not sure the immorality of the destruction of habitats is quite as unequivocal as that of the slaughter of animals for their flesh, skin, etc.

&gt;Like it or not, all our actions have consequences - unless you are going to live off-grid, grow permaculture and avoid anything that came out of a chemical plant, you're part of the 'animal cruelty' problem.

Moral consequentialism is childish and requires impossible predictive abilities, one of the key reasons I refuse to adopt utilitarianism as a moral outlook, despite it's day to day appeal.

&gt;Assuming you care about either of these issues I hardly think it appropriate to dismiss people's attempts to reduce their involvement when your hands are bloodied by the simple circumstance of living in Western civilization.

Again, you appear to be talking of moral consequentialism, which I refuse to accept as a valid critique of the moral status of any person.

&gt;""I"" am not aiming to stop anything, merely to understand your reasoning - judging by the downvotes, if not your reply, it was foolish to do so.

The downvotes are not from me, I don't care enough to vote regularly on reddit anymore.

My reasoning is based on the concept of speciesism and the deontological principle that it is always immoral to use another as a means to an end. Simple as that. On that basis the captivity of animals alone is immoral regardless of whether they are content or not. Ignoring this initial point because many care more about the killing than the captivity, animals are still killed in a vegetarian system. Cows which get to old, cows bred for leather, chickens which stop laying, many animals which get curably sick. The killing of animals is unavoidable, and the idea that we would practise animal husbandry but not kill (rather let all animals die of natural causes) them is so impractical as to seem impossible without some sort of really severe change to humanity. I will admit that from the perspective of non-killing it is acceptable, it still violates the principle of using another as a means to an end.

Actions have unintended impact, yes, but that is not our fault, and morality lies in intention, not in consequence. We *intend* to eat meat, *intend* cows to die so we can eat their flesh. We do not *intend* to buy rice which was harvested by an 8 year old, or eat grain which upon being harvested killed dozens of field mice. These things happen? Yes, often, no doubt. Should we aim to avoid these things as undesirable? Yes, quite possibly. Are we immoral because these things happen though? No.

edit: I'm not combative about this by the way, I hold fairly firm beliefs which I'm happy to explain and have so far found unshakable to any counter-argument. I would also point out: I eat meat. It is immoral that I do so, and means I am a lesser person than I could, and should be.",0,1359850918,null,0,1359851119,0,c88b8t1,t3_17r6jh,t1_c88b8t1,t1_c88awha,null,1431164926,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The players are good but the team hasn't been molded correctly. We had a great team which was essentially Mourinho's, and we milked it for all it was worth. Now we have suddenly realised there was no forward planning and no new team coming through. We bought the best young talent going but they are all too young and inexperienced.

I hate to compare us to Man U, but they challenge for and win titles year in year out. Why? Because they constantly evolve and rotate the team. I love the fact that we had the same players for a long time and a great team which had the ultimate climax in May, but we are paying for it now, we never prepared to rely on others. I know it's an old and weary thing to say, but the Torres transfer has hurt us more than we could have ever known. A top striker like Van Persie would have papered over a lot of cracks in the team and boosted our league position significantly.

Further you could do something to provide a bit of stature and illustriousness that a quality university has but a quality trades qualification seems not have when in reality they should be the same. I've always loved the way different trades (over 100) have their own [Livery Companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livery_Company) or Guilds in the City of London. It's very romantic (in [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(heroic_literature) sense). Wikipedia defines a guild as an 'association of partisans who control the practice of their craft'. 

Why not expand that nationwide and have the Electrician's Guild and the Plumber's Guild etc. They would be like an exam board crossed with a trade union. Qualifications could be managed by the guilds and they could even maintain industry standards. The guild would have a board voted for each year by practitioners of the relevant trades and a board would give out awards and stamps of quality which would be a sign of reliability. Having a Guild-certified qualification would set your career up and would hopefully bring a bit of romance to the noble craftsman.

What's being said is that the cultures that are CURRENTLY doing this the most seem to be the Islamic one. Nobody is saying only they do it and only they ever will. 


I don't even think it's about the religious side of it either, more the culture. for example i don't believe the Japanese were Kamikaze because of their religion but rather the ingrained culture of how far they will go in devotion to a cause for what they believe is 'the greater good' and being hailed a hero/martyr doesn't hurt either,  but it's more about their cause than their religion. 

You see it all the time with American culture in movies too,  watch just about every action movie and you'll see a soldier/good guy that sacrifices himself to take out a chunk of the enemy be it in plain old vengeance or a tactical last resort.

The pricing structure requires postgraduate qualifications before it starts making any kind of rational sense.  Book far enough in advance and you can go First for cheaper than Standard, but book half an hour later and the price of your Standard ticket doubles.  Then you have the two one-way singles from A-&gt;B and B-&gt;A which cost more than a return from A&lt;-&gt;B.  Then you have the outrageous season ticket costs for commuters who use the train every day - ¬£4000 a year for some people, chances are your mortgage payments add up to something close to that as well.

You want to travel from Station A to Station C, so you pay for that journey.  Board the train at Station B instead, but get bollocked by the ticket inspector and fined for getting on for the shorter journey even though you've paid for the longer one... how exactly is this a serious problem?  If it was the other way round then fine.

There is also something pretty borked when it's cheaper to fly to the continent than it is to take the train off-peak between two major UK cities.  Some say the convoluted pricing structure is deliberate in order to confuse passengers into paying more than they have to.

As the prices go up, we see no obvious difference in the quality of services.  Same old clapped out trains with worn seats, same old bumpy ride and same old delays because of the wrong type of snow 40 miles away.

true,ApolloHelix,null,null,"I'm very new to the series, very, very new.

But here's my takeaway: The 10th Doctor had a relatable, tragic, and sympathetic emotional story arc. Played off with comedic traits that rounds him off nicely.

Eccleston was on for 1 season, he had potential to become a favourite for many, but it's hard to latch onto an unfinished arc. Rose out-lived him.

The 10th Doctor had an interesting gimmick in that he had to reckon with his emotional attachment for Rose while being physically different. Then he loses her, tragically. From there, he must balance companionship with Martha with the respect for the loss of Rose, he can't just move on - sympathy. Donna was his mate; she's the companion he needed, not romantically involved with him, but reliable and brilliant. But when he lost her, his character developed into a bitter sadness that eventually saw him come to an end.

People attach themselves to Tennant's incarnation because he was the most emotionally available Doctor and he was the most human - sadness, and enthusiasm when appropriate.

The 11th is too inhuman. He's alien and has the emotionality of a teenager, and besides, Amy's affections lie with Rory. The 11th's series has been diluted. The Doctor's tragic humanity has been cast into River - trying to reckon her relationship with him despite conflicting timelines. The love story has been delegated to Amy and Rory, and the Doctor himself has only got the comedic aloofness that complemented the 10th's sadness.

tl;dr Eccleston had potential, but was short-lived. Tennant combines sadness, tragedy, comedy, and an emotional arc. - which makes him relatable. Smith has only comic aloofness, his other traits have been pawned off to the supporting cast.",0,1359865705,null,0,false,0,c88ez0t,t3_17s7f6,t1_c88ez0t,t3_17s7f6,null,1431166749,15,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,15

true,PeelianPleb,null,null,"I think you assume I'm talking about prison, and I am but only up to a point. I think the problems start a lot earlier than that. I could go on all night about this topic. This is not a Daily Mail inspired rant about Ian Huntly consuming caviare and Cuban cigars in his own private jacuzzi. 

I'm a police officer. We have a term, Prolific offenders. These are people that commit crime after crime after crime. Their crimes are most typically acquisitive. Their lifestyle is dependant on being able to commit crime. They'll go out to commit burglaries but if they see you walking down the street and they see your iPod, they'll make a good go of having that off you, if you look vulnerable, so much the better.  They'll be known to be violent, carry weapons, take and supply drugs, in some cases they will be connected to firearms. How do we know that they're prolific? Because we catch them, and we get them charged again and again. We do our bit, but they're still out there. That is my problem with the system as it is. Nothing ever changes. They go in and out of the system, time and time again, they never reform and they're never properly punished. They should not be allowed to be prolific. I've watched some of them grow up, I see youngsters who have started to come to our attention and a lot of the factors are the same. Some of those factors are of course behind the scope of the criminal justice system. I honestly think that these people, a tiny percentage of the population are responsible for a huge percentage of all crime. I'd say in some cases it could be as high as 50% of all crime in a given area.

I will preface this by saying that I am not adverse to reforming policing, far from it, I personally welcome a truly interdependent royal commission. I do however disagree entirely with the Winsor Report, I find some of his remarks as offensive as they are naive. When he has been on duty for 20 hours, with no break, dealing with harrowing circumstances and then finds himself comforting a victim of rape whilst she is being examined because he is the only one she will talk to he may tell me I have a ""clock in clock out culture"" and have the skills of ""a factory worker."" I digress. I do not believe that his report is in the least little bit interdependent, I believe that the actions of this government have already led to police officers and members of the public being put in grave danger. 

I think the first thing that really needs reform is the CPS. The Crown prosecution service. They have lost me cases by losing evidence. That is unacceptable. An isolated incident would be bad enough but it happens quite often. The Lawyers are generally very green, put them up against a defence solicitor who is experienced, calm, charismatic and the prosecution gets ripped to shreds despite having a damning stack of evidence against the accused. I've even had to explain what a particular law says to one of them before a trial because they didn't know! Those are not my main complaint though. My main complaint though is target culture in the CPS. Lets say I arrest someone because I saw them trying to force a house door open with a crow bar, they're wearing gloves and some kind of mask. Plainly its attempted burglary, it is more than merely preparatory and they would have committed burglary contrary to Section 9(1)(a) of the theft act had they not been interrupted. CPS, without a full and frank confession from the suspect, will not charge for anything more than criminal damage because its easier to prove. Its easy for them and they know its much easier for them to hit their target because they have to do a lot less to secure a conviction. It becomes really sickening when they try to make an ABH a common assault especially in domestic violence scenarios. They will try and get out prosecuting for anything that might be a bit tricky because it might upset their target of having a certain % of trials end up in guilty verdicts. They will bargain with the defence rather than go to trial, meaning again, without any consideration to the victim, they will go for the soft option. 

The court and sentencing system needs reforming. I believe that the way we run trials is in the main fair and with improvements to the CPS this could be bettered. There are issues with the jury system and although I believe in it, I feel it can be bettered. You have a much better chance of securing a conviction at Guildford Crown Court than you do at Snaresbrook Crown Court. That is simply down to the population from which the jury will be drawn. Magistrates courts need reforming. In this day and age I do not believe that lay benches are fit for purpose. When the magistrate knows about as much about the law behind a given offence as I know about navigating a nuclear submarine, we have a problem. On the sentencing front I do believe that a number of sentences are unduly lenient. We have a regular customer who normally has a very blas√© attitude to the police (to put it politely) and to the justice system. He was arrested for a crime and he knew he'd be found guilty, he knew he was going to go down for a big stretch. Suddenly he was addressing all police officers as sir and ma'am (except sergeants who he addressed by their rank and surname), he asked to see the intelligence unit,  he gave them lots of information, he was doing whatever he could to get a shorter sentence. He always liked to play the hard man but that day he was crying quite openly in front of us. I think that handing out a strong (not draconian) sentence in the first place would deter a lot of people. Every time I see a youngster come through our doors I can only hope that the short sharp shock of being in custody helps the grow out of offending. I've watched people walk free from court without so much as a fine after committing, and being found guilty of theft, having had in excess of 100 previous convictions for theft. 

Prison does need reforming. I believe we have the semblance of a working system, I am far from an expert on it and I know that. I believe that prison should be made to be a more unpleasant place to be sent. it isn't somewhere that people want to go, neither should it be. I do however think that it is important that prisoners are given the chance to reform themselves and they need to be set up for success when they come out of prison, if people come out and they're at square one then what do we really expect is going to happen? Say there is a prisoner who has been sentenced for six months for theft (yeah that'll be the day) they'll serve 10 weeks in prison. Now lets say they can't read or write. They're more than willing to learn. So lets send them on a literacy course, give them some skills and help them get a job. For a basic literacy course to come long they might wait 6 weeks. No one can learn to read and write in 4 weeks. So now they come out again, and they still can't read or write, they're back to square one, they've got a cat's chance in hell of getting a job. The writing is on the wall, they're going to become in criminality again. So our man commits another crime, he's given another sentence of 6 months, he tries to learn to read and write again, he can't, he's released, the cycle continues. 

Unfortunately all these things require money and I don't see much changing really. The revolving door of justice will continue to hit the victim on the arse as they leave disappointed yet again.

But at the same time the potential is just that, *potential* and little more, at a time when we're in desperate need of goals/results to continue the recovery and if he comes here he'll struggle for game time. Just look at Hendo, as a similar player, leaving his home-town club for his first permanent move he too struggled to perform and is only now starting to really express himself. Carroll would need a similar amount of time, and unlike Hendo who can operate in CM and RM, as well as CAM and *RB apparently*, Carroll can only work as a CF, so as an option his application is really somewhat limited.

I'd love it if he could come back, he represents a huge mistake on our part and the chance to change that should be motivation enough to let him have another crack but looking at our squad right now; he can't really add much more that an aerial threat.

true,PrettyFlaco,null,null,"IMO the problems this season are 3 fold   
  
**1. Squad Management/Development:**   
There didn't seem to be any thought into how this team was going to be built. If Chelsea were going to play 4231 then why was 20 million pounds used to buy a Mata clone in Oscar when Meireles and Essien were both allowed to leave and it was known well in advance Mikel would leave for at least a month in a heavy fixture period. There were not enough players who could play in the holding midfield roles, that 20 million spent on Oscar could have got Lars Bender or Capoue or Dembele etc etc. players who would have been able to serve the void left by Meireles, Essien and Mikel. Why was no striker brought in to replace Drogba in the summer after Torres had shown no sign of improvement? Lukkaku could have gotten just as much game time here as WBA if he hadn't been loaned out. The most frustrating thing about the squad is that we have more than enough talent but loaned way too many players away 
    
  
**2. We have been raped by injuries, suspensions, and international duty:**  
This is no ones fault but losing Terry, Lampard, Mikel, Moses, Cech, Hazard, Luiz at various times and often for extensive periods have severely crippled the squad at times and have been exacerbated by my first point that this squad was built without any foresight.   
     
  
**3. Rafa's has done a poor job:**   
Ill say this because of all the injuries, suspensions and international duty things could have been a lot worse we are still in third and are 4-0 against Everton, Spurs, and Arsenal so far but Rafa's coaching decisions have directly led to the losses at West Ham and QPR and giving up leads at Southhampton and Reading. When opposing coaches have made changes that affect the momentum of a game Rafa doesn't make adjustments and this leads to the breakdowns in those games. His nonsensical rotations cost us at QPR and the stability in the defense has diminished because there is a different back four every game ",0,1359870203,null,0,1359871448,0,c88g468,t3_17rcoh,t1_c88g468,t3_17rcoh,null,1431167286,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

I particularly like the points he raises about squad depth. The Essien loan followed by the Meireles transfer really did come across as bizarre. Combine that with the 25 players out on loan and your left with the fact that someone dropped the ball. Rafa at least called out the lack of depth publicly.

It shouldn't be forgotten that Roman dealt Chelsea a massive body blow when he fired Robbie. Everyone had such amazing good will towards him. A former Chelsea player who took the helm with such dignity against all odds and really pulled off the impossible. He brought Chelsea back from Munich, Champions of Europe, only to be embarrassed and fired 6 months later at 4 o'clock in the  morning. The move fully upset the apple cart. It loaded pressure on a rocky younger team in transition and threw the fans into disarray.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;I honestly think that these people, a tiny percentage of the population are responsible for a huge percentage of all crime. I'd say in some cases it could be as high as 50% of all crime in a given area.

There's a thing called [the Pareto principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle), which you may have heard of, it's not unlikely it applies to offending as it applies to many other areas of life.  That would imply that 80% of offences are perpetrated by 20% of the offenders.  Also, without wishing to seem like I'm attacking, it's also true that by ""keeping an eye"" on known offenders you inevitably increase the proportion of their offences for which they are apprehended/charged/convicted (what would be the point otherwise?), but also possibly attach to them offences for which they weren't responsible.

&gt;I believe that the actions of this government have already led to police officers and members of the public being put in grave danger. 

I agree with you on this.

&gt;The Crown prosecution service. They have lost me cases by losing evidence. That is unacceptable. An isolated incident would be bad enough but it happens quite often. The Lawyers are generally very green, put them up against a defence solicitor who is experienced, calm, charismatic and the prosecution gets ripped to shreds despite having a damning stack of evidence against the accused. I've even had to explain what a particular law says to one of them before a trial because they didn't know!

I also agree on this.  There are some excellent (and fair) prosecutors.  There are some zealots I found frankly disturbing.  There are lots of time servers who coast, and there are lots of inexperienced and low quality lawyers too.  Unless you have a certain kind of meticulous legal mind, or unless you have a strong drive to want to prosecute (which can lead to the zealotry which worries me), putting together a prosecution case sufficiently carefully, in a fair-minded fashion, just isn't as attractive or exciting as defence work, and so it tends not to attract the best and the brightest.

&gt;CPS, without a full and frank confession from the suspect, will not charge for anything more than criminal damage because its easier to prove. Its easy for them and they know its much easier for them to hit their target because they have to do a lot less to secure a conviction.

It's interesting, because we actually seem to agree here as well, albeit from different ends.  I was arguing on this forum the other day that the conviction rates looked worryingly high, especially in Crown Courts, and if it's really degenerating into a culture of targets where the prosecution will pick easy to prosecute crimes to meet them, that's a partial explanation.  If you have the evidence, you should definitely be going for them on the crime they allegedly did, not trying to mop up the numbers on low level bullshit charges that just serve to keep them numbers up but don't do anyone any favours at the end of the day.

&gt;It becomes really sickening when they try to make an ABH a common assault especially in domestic violence scenarios.

Yeah, I saw one of these the other day.  A couple of guys hitting some others around the heads with hammers and ended up convicted of ABH when there was  clear legal case for a GBH charge on the wounds received, but it must have been ruled out by the CPS following their Noddy's guide to prosecuting (presumably the section on ""seriousness"").  And your bit on deals makes me think we're moving towards the US system, which from a defence perspective I would despise because it really results in the elimination of justice from both sides of the equation.  You get charged, the legal representation you get is shoddy unless you have money (it's better in the UK currently, but degrading), and you have a choice to either cop a plea to a bullshit low level offence or you run the risk of spending the rest of your days inside if you fight it.  So no one fights, everyone is convicted and nobody - defendant nor victim - gets justice.

&gt;You have a much better chance of securing a conviction at Guildford Crown Court than you do at Snaresbrook Crown Court. That is simply down to the population from which the jury will be drawn.

They did change the area from which juries were drawn a while back to improve the disparities.  Back in my day, we used to love to defend a case with a Snaresbrook jury - especially handling, which many didn't appear to believe should be a crime.  On the other hand, with some of the Kingston and county town juries, you might as well plead guilty and be done with it.

I'm also critical of magistrates, partly for their (lack of) knowledge of the law, but mostly because their old nickname of ""police"" courts is still too often apt.

&gt;I think that handing out a strong (not draconian) sentence in the first place would deter a lot of people.

I'm not convinced across the board, mainly because the idea of deterrence is mostly a canard.  Most criminals don't expect to get caught when they are considering the commission of a crime, so the likely sentence doesn't enter their heads.  However, it may have an impact on your regulars, because their chances of being caught are clearly greater.  I'm more inclined to see sentencing policy as unbalanced.  There are too many people in prison on drug and other offences for which they shouldn't be there, and people who are guilty of serious, incredibly harmful white collar crimes remain at large.  Serious violent crimes should also be dealt with sufficiently to allow people, especially the weak and vulnerable, to go about their business free from fear.

Where I'm sure you and I will diverge quite strongly is on property crime.  I think most property crime is reflective of the economic system and our society, and we should mostly focus on addressing the problems there.

I broadly agree that, if we're going to send people to prison with the intention of at some point releasing them, we should give them the best possible chance of coming out with a mind and skill set to be able to function as sociable and effective members of the community when they do.",0,1359872358,null,0,1359874771,0,c88gmix,t3_17rxgz,t1_c88gmix,t1_c88f6hu,null,1431167528,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,Catemoon,null,null,"I'm sorry to say this but you are giving slightly misleading and potentially dangerous advice. NHS Direct in England should not (and will not) book anyone with dental pain in with an emergency doctor, no matter how many opinions you insist on asking for. Those working at NHS Direct are able to assess the nature of your problem and offer advice and/or refer you on. In the case of toothache they will refer you to the emergency dentist or your own dentist. Dental pain is not an issue for your doctor, and hospital doctors or GPs seeing patients attending with dental pain should refer immediately to a dentist.  

The dentist is able to assess properly *whether or not* antibiotics are required and which type may be necessary, and amoxicillin, while often  very useful, could be dangerous or even fatal for many patients.

If a doctor without further dentistry qualifications IS ever obliged to prescribe antibiotics for a patient with toothache in an extreme emergency, he should also furnish the patient with a letter to give to the dentist, which should contain full details of the symptoms and signs that led to his decision to prescribe. They never, *ever* bloody do this. The patient then happily turns up at the dental surgery several days later with no symptoms or signs of the gross infection that caused so much trouble, expecting diagnosis and treatment, and often with no clue of which tooth was the source of the trouble, or even if it *was * a tooth. Sometimes the only thing the dentist can do is send the patient away and wait for the symptoms to recur so that the correct tooth or soft tissues can be treated, which is a horrible interim outcome. Also it limits which antibiotics can be used when the infection recurs, which it will, so the success of future treatment is compromised. 

tl;dr: Go to a dentist, not a doctor, when you have any kind of mouth trouble, antibiotics may not be required in the treatment of your toothache, and if they are, amoxicillin is not suitable for everyone or even for all dental infections, and may be dangerous.

Seconds go and see your dentist, if you have one or register with one locally. If you don't have one already you an do a google search for an NHS one, look for reviews of the ones near to you, and you also might be able to find one that specialises in patients who need a particular type of care. 

When you speak to them, ask if you can speak to a receptionist quietly somewhere to explain your problem, and then see what they say. They may want/need to have a look in your mouth first to confirm the tooth is broken, or take an x ray. Not sure how you might deal with that, maybe taking a photo of the broken tooth to show them is an option? It's not ideal for the dentist but at least it will show them you do have a broken tooth. 

Ask them if it is possible to have sedation while having work done, some clinics offer th service there, others will refer you to a specialist place. I have been with someone who was horrendously dental phobic (not the same as your issue I know ) while he went for sedation to have tooth removed, it was brilliant. Not only didn't he feel a thing, but he was so out of it he didn't realise anything that was going on, and didn't remember much about it after either. That is pretty key as otherwise I would create memories that would feed into the phobia. 

Depending on your history, when you see your GP it might be worth asking him to refer you for some help with your phobia, but that really is entirely up to you.

true,Grumbillz,null,null,"Chelsea has had a trying time of late, but this post includes the two thing that I have found to be so utterly bizarre as to defy all explanation. 

The first is why was Meireles moved on, especially when he was moved on. It was so apparent at the time that we needed exactly the type of player that he is, that even if Essien's loan to Real Madrid was unforseen, it made absolutely no sense. With the type of midfield players we had, their experience levels, squad depth, ACON, it just made no sense whatsoever. 

The second is the non-purchase of ANYONE in the transfer window.

Reading the Guardian (not The Sun, Daily Mirror) article from 2007 posted on here recently about Abramovich telling Essien how to play in front of a whiteboard through Shevchenko as translator gave me a really queasy feeling about what happens behind Stamford doors while we yammer on about Torres.

Has Roman written off the season with a caretaker dead weight coach until 2013/14? Was Guardiola meant to be the masterplan before Pep decided against the Chelsea chalice though it meant turning down a fortune? 

I think that the above post highlights how we still talk about Chelsea like a regular club, when it appears to be run in a totally separate universe.

No fan will ever downplay what Roman has done for this club, but I think it would be helpful to keep in mind that the idea of him as a spectator in the crowd as Benitez fucks everything up is perhaps simplistic.",0,1359889995,null,0,false,0,c88j4u3,t3_17rcoh,t1_c88j4u3,t1_c886xwk,null,1431168711,19,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,19

true,alister667,lfc68,,"I've seen a lot of people mistake height for strength. 

People will list the likes of Mata (or Modric) as proof strength isn't needed to excel in the PL. Mata is a strong enough player. He's not tall, but he's not overly thin either, and at 24 he is strong enough.
 
Strength often comes with age - by the time they're 23-24 most players will be stronger than when they were 19-20. If you have a very thin player aged 19-20 who's not used to the PL (look at Lucas for instance) they can struggle.

Strength is not related to height - look a Maradonna. And ultimately it can be easily worked on, the only problem is it might take a year for the player to adjust.

With regards Coutinho I guess we'll see. The things that worry me about him is that he is thin and young and if he plays in the centre he might find himself up against some very strong players in the PL. Also, of course, he could be much stronger than he looks. Maybe playing a little wider he could find it easier. I guess time will tell. I hope he has the skill and speed to skip past a lot of challenges. If not, I suspect he'll be an even better player in a year's time.

true,Noitche,uk,Bristol,"I'd actually like to raise a decent discussion about bias in terms of the BBC. I just don't see how it works.

Here's the thing. The BBC is meant to be ""balanced"". This means it can air programs with very different perspectives as long as it airs a roughly equal number of programs for each perspective. This is just about understandable.

But it all falls down with BBC News. I go to the gym quite often and watch BBC News and whilst at the gym I naturally have time to let my mind wander. And what I think is this. It is impossible to be fair and balanced. It's a stupid requirement. We can get really technical here and start talking about the language newsreaders use. Language is whatever two people can successfully communicate with, thus it is dependent on the understanding and, more importantly, the acceptance of the language used by both parties. An example would be ""loyalists"", in reference to the Northern Ireland kerfuffle. Many disapprove of the use of that word, not wanting violence associated with being loyal to the UK. How do you possibly resolve that? Even if the majority don't mind, it's still not being balanced. 

And it's definitely *not* unbiased. Language sways people a great deal. Hell, just reporting on something sways people. Sure, the Daily Mail intentionally uses this as a tactic, whereas BBC News doesn't, but the effect can still be the same. 

The BBC receives so many complaints because everyone thinks they own it. And that's a problem. I'm really torn because I absolutely love BBC programming but I can't for the life of me work out how BBC News (which is also well-executed) can, in principle, be accepted as fair and unbiased.

Another example to finish. The other day a presenter was talking to a guy who's house had been broken into and who's son was threatened with an axe. The presenter finished off the conversation by saying ""such a harrowing experience"" and ""good luck to you"". That's an opinion. It might be one many people share, but it's an opinion that should simply not exist, in principle, on a publicly-funded news program. Let me make it clear that I'm not saying it's hideously bad, I'm just pointing out that surely such a thing goes completely against the BBC's mandate. How could they possibly justify it? What, in other words, is their philosophy or set of rules which explain what is and isn't okay? Because it seems to be really muddled. 

It seems that someone in the past thought it would be a brilliant idea to have an unbiased news source. And then promptly set a load of guidelines without actually thinking in any depth about the subject. And now there are a load of ad-hoc rules to make up for that person's shortcomings. This is why newsreaders can't say certain words, but can say others. Despite the fact that an equal number of people might disapprove of the latter as do the former. It's a complete mess.

As to the whole debate on whether civil partnerships should be equal to marriage I like to think of it like this:
Once upon a time, black people were effectively segregated from the whites on public transport. Sure, both colours were allowed on the same bus, but they were not afforded equal rights.
You're white? You can sit there, at the front. Black? Well, you can just go right to the back. No mixing allowed!

Like I said, both groups are allowed on the bus, or in this case a partnership of sorts, but the distinction here is in the execution, equal but different, IS NOT EQUAL!!

I see this as the same issue, and it's the reason I have never taken a civil partnership despite being with the same woman now for 16 years. I'm either an equal human being, or I'm not. And that goes both ways, and I'm just as supportive of heterosexual couples who want to (but can't) have civil partnerships.

It can't be for denying clear goal scoring, as Ba had already hit the ball. Was challenging for the ball, so that leaves excessive force.

There was not really a problem with Colocini kicking it, or putting power behind the kick (He was trying to clear the ball). The problem was that he was too slow getting to it. It was more akin to a mistimed tackle, not a shocking tackle. It was not a scenario in which Colocini had no right to be attempting what he did.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;It's a complicated, emotive issue, with the added fuel of financial/legal benefits being thrown onto the fire.

No, it's actually very, very simple. Presently, some couples are entitled to fewer rights than others based upon their sexual orientation. This is inequality, and if you support it you are a bigot.

&gt;No matter what the decision is, someone will be unhappy with the outcome and someones rights will be trodden on.

If you think that granting rights to a group of people who have been arbitrarily denied them is a violation of someone else's rights, you are deluded.

&gt;My suggestion is that marriage/civil partnership from the governments perspective at least, become the same thing. One contractual agreement with set financial/legal benefits, regardless of the two people entering into it. All forms, whether its for ya bank account or a tax return refer to a ""partner"", or a ""partnership"".

What advantage does this hold over simply legalising gay marriage?

&gt;If they they wish to have a party or a religious ceremony to make it feel special, then they can fill their boots. If they wish to refer to their other half as a husband/wife then they can feel free. If they want to call it a marriage, wear rings etc, then they do that.

true,lemonmylyman,1953,,"Maybe I'll be downvoted for this due to the love for DBFM, but I think there are a few flaws with his analysis of Chelsea. Overall, I think the theme is something I have championed to my friends (that of a questionable squad and terrible transfer-management), though I feel like there were some factually incorrect information in **part 3 of his low-down** we shouldn't be relaying in pub-chats in the future.

* Hazard has never played behind the striker for a prolonged period of time. His longest run was towards the end of last season when he started five games behind the striker. Before this, and largely throughout his three years, he was a left winger (sometimes deployed on the right). A friend who watches Ligue 1 closely (it's literally his job) was pretty adamant that Hazard gets lost behind the striker, and that is why he is not allowed to play that role. This has been proven true at Chelsea, as well (remember away vs. QPR, Bertrand LW, Hazard AM? remember how that went? Yeah). Basically, Hazard lacks the football intelligence (Mata) or paradigm-shifting creativity (Oscar) to be deployed behind the striker. This may change later in his career, but at this point, don't assume we bought an AM. We bought an LW who fits the 4-2-3-1 system very well.

* With this in mind, Oscar makes sense as a transfer. Mata largely played out wide in any game that mattered last year. He has also played out wide most of his career prior to Chelsea. Nowadays he plays behind the striker, but is also the only one not named Oscar (KDB has also been reverted into an AM, but was a winger when bought) who can do this effectively. Oscar was logical as a back up AM to Mata in the beginning, and (if he turned out to be amazing) to push Mata back wide once he found his feet in the EPL. Oscar makes sense.

* I agree Essien and Meireles going is absurd. If Mou finds a place for Essien, so should any other manager in the world. However, Ramires and Lampard are far from complete opposite for the formation. Lampard, for one, has become a Xabi Alonso-like footballer. He's basically Alonso, but with better forward drive. He sits most of the time, and chooses the times he enters the box in accordance with the defensive duties of the players around him. He is very well suited for the formation. For evidence, see Schweinsteiger. In a similar vein, Ramires is Khedira. A strong box-to-box midfielder who will cover for his slower counter-part, yet will break tackles and run with the ball forward. If Germany could be this successful with Schweiny and Khedira, it is far from unheard of that we should be sulking over Ramires and Lampard as our two defensive midfielders in a 4-2-3-1.


This just a short 3-point counter-argument to DBFM's part 3 analysis of our current midfield. I agree with a lot of what he says, but in terms of midfield acquisitions and personnel, I wouldn't say he is being completely rationale. 

Basically, the reason we are losing/struggling isn't because of our personnel unable to fit into the 4-2-3-1 formation. It's simply the 4-2-3-1 formation being applied incorrectly. Want to see it correctly applied? Watch Hiddink work his magic on Ballack, for example.

I had never watched the show in any shape or form before and the only real knowledge I had of it was gathered from the odd conversation amongst my friends. I always assumed it looked like a terribly cheesy, childish sci-fi show; I've never been a fan of big green aliens and things. But then on the day I finally signed up for Netflix I decided to begin watching.

First opinions were ""Bloody hell, I never knew there was any modern Doctors before Tennant"" and ""Wait, who is this Rose girl? I thought Amy was the companion for the entire modern era?""...both thoughts show my prior ignorance of the show. Then all too soon I was absolutely fascinated. I've always believed that with fascinating enough characters a show can become incredible very quickly, an other example of this concept is BBC's Sherlock. Discovering this humorous but badass, childish but smart, weird but down-to-earth character of the Doctor hooked me and I instantly couldn't wait for the next episode.

Now I'm as massive fan, currently working my way though the classic episodes and genuinely enjoying them.

* Benny: 8/10 - Looked like he's back to his normal self, very good lobbed balls for Bale and good crossing. Kept up defensively.

* Walker: 8/10 - Again, good defensive showing and was really good going up front as well, didn't think he did much wrong.

* Vertonghen+Dawson: 9/10 - Fantastic in center of defence, against a formidable Lukaku and Long they were SOLID. Good stuff. Saved us a lot.

* Parker: 6/10 - Lost possession a little and seemed out of sorts with some heavy touches. Good to have him though.

* Dembele: 8/10 - BEAST. Bossed the midfield, spread the ball really well.

* Lennon: 6.5/10 - Didn't like that after we went up a goal he basically stopped attacking and played all the balls he got sideways. :(

* Bale: 9/10 - Nuff said.

* Dempsey: 2/10 - The only player on the pitch who looked uninspired and out of sorts. If Defoe sits out the next game, Holtby and Siggy to start please.

* Holtby: 7/10 - Didn't have the same electricity as expected, but still did a decent job. He's getting into good positions, once he sets in he's going to be beautiful.

* Defoe: 6/10 - Didn't mind what he did today, made some good runs. Looked sharp.

* Siggy + Gallas: Fair play. Didn't do much wrong and were stable.

- Rodgers has doubts over Skrtel's leadership and mentality; that's why Carra got Skrtel's spot in the first place, and Skrtel had a chance to prove Rodgers wrong in the Oldham game but blew it

- It doesn't bode well for Skrtel, who should be in his prime years to be below an ageing veteran in the pecking order, and he'd probably happily leave for a club that will make him a first XI regular and offer CL football.

- Skrtel's new contract would have put his wages, etc. at the level of a first XI regular; if he isn't a first XI regular then he's not value-for-money.

- Of all our 'big value' players, Skrtel is the easiest to replace - we could sell him for a very good price and replace him with some left over, which will help Rodgers' squad building.

Obviously there's plenty of time this season for Skrtel to show the characteristics Rodgers wants and for him to reclaim Carragher's spot - I think Rodgers is looking for Skrtel to react the way Enrique, Downing &amp; Henderson have this season.

I'm not qualified to give any legal advice but personally I can't see the CPS taking this case up. You're a foreign student who can and has argued that he wasn't aware of UK laws and as far as we're aware, you don't have any history with the Police.

The shock (a biological response, not an electric shock) is a response to being hit with a Taser.  I deliberately used the phrase  "" shutting down in response to pain"" rather than ""shock"" because of it's double meaning.

Completely ignores the fact that when you lose local shops you lose choice. Supermarkets will only stock what sells well in a town so you end up with a choice based on the tastes of the majority.

Edit: Okay, just wanted you to see my warning before an impulsive buy.

Allow me to elaborate:

In it's current state, you are essentially paying for FoxSoccerPLUS on the internet + on Demand. If you are a fan of the Premiere League or even a fan of Football and love watching as many games as possible, FoxSoccer2Go, while expensive at $20/month, can be a decent buy.  Access the mobile app is a nice perk, but it's a perk at best. Not to mention all Premiere League streams are basically direct feeds from Premiere League Productions so you're getting goal highlights, previews, and featurettes during the half (this season it's Around the World which highlights foreign players in the Premiere League). Oh, and Casabian's *Fire*.  Lots and lots of Casabian's *Fire*. Premiere League matches, FA Cup, CONCACAF Champions League, UEFA Champions League &amp; Europa League seems like a steal at $20 but in reality the service has humongous potential but is marred by broadcast restrictions.  

If you are a fan of Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, or Spurs and ONLY care about these teams, **DO NOT** subscribe to Foxsoccer2go.  If a game airs on FoxSoccer you cannot watch it live on FoxSoccer2go. You have to wait ~14 hours before you can watch it on-demand (basically when the game's result is old hat). For east coast, the game is available to watch at 11:59PM. Chelsea in particular, have been featured a lot on FoxSoccer.  Of the ~21 matchdays in the Premiere League  that FS2GO has aired this year, only 3 have been live (fun fact, Chelsea only won one of those live matches which was against Norwich, the other two were draws with Southampton &amp; Reading).  The other 3 games were on ESPN. If you look at Chelsea's schedule on FoxSoccer2go, http://www.foxsoccer2go.com/upcoming, you'll see ONE of their games through March 2nd live. Their Europa League fixture. The tape delay for their FA Cup tie is reasonable and will be available at 9AM. **If you are hoping to watch Chelsea matches live and contribute to match threads and such, FoxSoccer2Go will not help you.** 

Last year there were broadcast restrictions on the Champions League as well.  You'd have to wait a few hours after the fact (IIRC, the Champions League final was available 3 hours after the matches' conclusion). This year all games are broadcast live. You can watch Chelsea's upcoming Europa League matches live but they are mid-week in the middle of the workday so you can't really enjoy it unless you have an awesome job.

Now, if you live in the States, remember that NBC bought the Premiere League rights for the next 3 years.  That means FoxSoccer2go will not be able to offer you any Premiere League matches (unless NBC sub-licenses). FoxSoccer is rumored to be merged with SPEED and other fringe sports networks with Champions League at the helm.  What does that mean? Well, expect broadcast restrictions back on Champion League &amp; Europa League matches. For $20/month, that's not worth it to me.

Our squad could come together with proper leadership.  Roman Abramovich has certainly messed with ~~our~~ his team and coaches too much.  But, stopping the coaching train at Rafa station is just like giving up.  

As far as the players.  We are lacking in quality of play but not in talent.  When I see our defenders running forward into the box, I cringe.  Then, sure enough, we get scored on.  Our set plays are atrocious.  Our defensive structure is laughably soft on breakaways and counters.  As ManU always seems to score at the end, we capitulate at the end as assuredly.  In pure talent, we could have the best defense in the league, but we don't.  We show signs of a brilliant offense, but at the expense opp breakaway goals.

The Rafa/Torres experiment was not the answer(note past tense).  BA will need some time.  If Lamps really goes, how much longer before Terry?

There's no time bomb. We effectively set our own interest rates on debt via the Bank of England. It will always be fine, for all government debt is denominated in GBP, and the market assumes we will sooner print than default. That it's 100% safe. Accordingly, interest rates will remain low no matter how much debt we have, and always very close to expectations of the borrowing rate.

You pay it back when/if households start dissaving, but you ought to just allow debt to accrue when households are saving. The whole reason this is all so painful at the moment is because Cameron's fighting households on doing the latter, trying to force down a deficit that wants to increase. And for no real point.

But with Eleven I find it pretty obvious that the enthusiasm is being propped up as a shield. There's a few instances where he says something that sounds happy and bouncy, but the instant no one is looking at him, he truly looks like he's a thousand year old. You get that a little bit with Tennant, but not as much, and not as well done. 

And then Eleven is almost always a step or three ahead of the audience, and he doesn't always explain it - it isn't obvious until he zaps Amy with the sonic screwdriver, and 'poof'! Eleven lies, he manipulates, and I find that a thousand times more interesting than the relatively straightforward way Tennant worked. Especially since you aren't really sure if Eleven's acting or not.

The one thing I will say is that Eleven likes to say things like ""Look, I'm angry, that's new. I'm really not sure what's going to happen now."" - as if an angry doctor is terrifying, but he's never actually followed through on being scary. Honestly, he could just make an actual, specific threat and I'd be happy. 

Which is the opposite of Ten's annoying thing where he did something completely horrible - Family of Blood, anyone - and no one called him on it. Until Adelaide.

He's better at running past defenders deep into the box while waiting for a short pass for a goal. Drogba was a strong striker and could push past defenders with ease whereas Torres (while still pretty strong) relies too much on fancy dribbles to push up. I'd even go as far as to say putting Ba in a position behind Torres. It'll let Torres sneak up past defenders and Ba can act as a decoy.

- Both the goals were down to errors from us - beyond that City never really had a look in, which is credit to how well we shut them down, especially Silva &amp; Aguero, who was non-existant in the first half.

- But this has to be probably the 3rd goal we've conceded from a throw-in this season (to my memory - Everton, Oldham and now this), which is fucking absurd for a top-flight team.

- Lucas continues to boss Man City. It's just a given at this point, and I love it. Gerrard had a great game as well, even though he tried to force some passes a bit more today than usual.

- We're definitely much better with Henderson on the left and Suarez centrally than the vice-versa against Arsenal - Suarez can track back well, but it reduces his effectiveness way too much.

Many times this season I've found myself disagreeing with BR's substitutions. Usually I chalk it up to him being a young inexperienced manager, but this time I saw something different.
So, added time kicks in, we are giving it to Man City, the ball is consistantly in our half and Man City doesn't look at all like scoring. We are dominating the midfield and Suarez and Sturridge and looking dangerous. I'm thinking, with five added minutes, we might actually have a chance at scoring and winning.


Then Rodgers makes a completely counter-productive substitution, bringing in Allen, for Sturridge. This is clearly a defensive substitution, bringing a defensive, ball winning midfielder in place of our attacking goal scorer.
Now, in my eyes, this move is saying ""We have the draw, let's keep it,"" which, in some situations, would be a good move, but we are taking to to Man City and have been for the last half hour. All season Brendan has been spouting out top four talk, but now when we get in a position where we have a chance to beat a top four team we make a move to curl over in the last five minutes and play defensive football.
It's as if Brendan is scared of losing so he plays for draws. If we're looking like winning then play to win.

That movie just really frustrated me. We didn't need any help defensively, all we did was take away from our attack. If anything I feel like we should have brought in Borini for Downing, or Borini for Henderson.

* Banter and craic. We will never be a country that takes itself too seriously

* Icons. Actors, poets, you name it, we have put our people on the world stage.
* History. We are rich in culture (often mistaken as tribalism by people who live here) and history both good and bad
* Potential. NI2012 ""Its Our Time"" proved we have the potential to put this city, this country on the world map, with not just entertainment, but sporting events, and job industrys such as IT etc

Why I hate this shitty county

true,Ruwn,null,null,"&gt; Instead we're going to make two valued members of the squad train away from the first team with the transfer window already shut. Whose decision this is, it's not quite clear, but as we will come to see (with Malouda), perhaps it wasn't Villas-Boas' decision after all. What does this say about the organisational structures at the club? Does it scream ""well thought out planning, by a sensible and rational football policy"" or does it scream ""ad hoc idiocy""?

AVB puts them there. I can‚Äôt believe in good faith that the club told him who to play and where to put them. A complicated answer vs a simple answer. To be fair, Malouda at this point has started to lose his skill. I don‚Äôt know why, but his technical ability tanks this season. 
&gt;There is no plan. There is no idea of where the club is going. Andre Villas-Boas makes mistakes, sure, but there is nothing like the support needed for a 33 year old manager coming into one of the biggest bear pits in football. 

You don‚Äôt get spoonfed and coddled just because you‚Äôre (relatively) young. Tough shit, he‚Äôs a grown man getting paid to do his job, if he can‚Äôt do it right it‚Äôs his fault. End of story.
&gt; Roberto Di Matteo somehow manages to guide the club to win the Champions League.

Ha. Ignoring that he has the same personnel as his predecessor yet can motivate them to achieve what was deemed impossible. Sure, he couldn‚Äôt secure a 4th place spot in the league, but as you know he got us a double. You must be of the bunch that subscribe to the ‚Äúit‚Äôs all luck‚Äù theory. If we look at the league only, he‚Äôs pretty close to Benitez in terms of points in the league, so we know he‚Äôs about as good tactically (but in my opinion much better). Any man who can make Jose fucking Bosingwa play well deserves a god damn statue. I can‚Äôt believe you award Robbie one sentence and AVB so much attention. 
&gt;However, this isn't a true indicator of the health of the club. With a depleted/inadequate squad, the team rightfully finish sixth.

With a squad competing in the final stages of the UCL and FA cup, any manager would gladly play weakened sides in the EPL. Finishing sixth isn‚Äôt a reflection of Chelsea‚Äôs health. It reflects that maybe if we had a full sized squad we‚Äôd do better. But this is the season (11/12) of transition for me, and that‚Äôs never going to have a full squad.  
&gt;So who's to blame? 

AVB. If you‚Äôre gonna take it on yourself to revolutionize Chelsea by throwing out some players and alienating the older ones in favor of your Portuguese contingent, you better damn well have results. Do I need to go over how many times JB was played when he shouldn‚Äôt have been? There was the infamous Cole substitution as well. How many defensive lapses did Meireles have under AVB? Yeah he‚Äôs not a defensive player, but how come these were more or less cut out when RDM took over? Then there‚Äôs the whole zone-defending nonsense we had to put up with. To pack icing on the shit cake, JB played really well under RDM. All of the problems, I award to AVB this season. He had the players, maybe not enough, but he had the players. 

&gt;we need a right back - good purchase in Azpilicueta. We desperately need some attacking players - excellent purchases in Hazard and Oscar. However, where do they fit into a formation? Eden Hazard largely played in a 10 role behind the striker for Lille, yet Juan Mata has been doing that for Chelsea. Oscar largely played in a 10 role behind the striker for Internacional and the Brazilian national team, yet Chelsea already have Juan Mata. Oh well, I'm sure it will work out. They're good players. Victor Moses and Marko Marin are added as depth options. Moses - great signing.

Our problem is that we don‚Äôt stretch the defending team enough. Moses and Marin were brought as wingers, and no one expected mata, hazard, and Oscar to all play in the center. The board are clearly going for an emphasis on a larger midfield, something Barca does to perfection. Is it the right decision? Who knows, they‚Äôre all young and have plenty of time to learn to play together. With Moses, we get a forward with pace and power who can play anywhere up front. A good option for anything. With Marin we get a winger on the other side should we need it. 
&gt; We suddenly realised that we had lost the majority of our mainstays in attack over the past season and a half - Drogba, Anelka, Kalou and Malouda (as he was supposed to leave). We needed a new attack anyway. Could these players fit into a 4-2-3-1? Of course, they're good players. They'll work it out.

We still have Sturridge and Torres, and with Moses we really don‚Äôt need more in a 4-2-3-1. We have Romeu, Ramires, Lamps, Mata, Oscar, Hazard, Mikel, Malouda (though he‚Äôs past it), Marin, Benayoun, and Bertrand. 11 (12 w/ malouda) for 5 positions. Even without Essien, that‚Äôs plenty of depth. In defense, we have insane depth. The issue at this point is figuring out the best formation. As long as we mix and match defensive with offensive, on paper we would be fine.
&gt;What about the asinine double pivot policy? Well, we have a still raw Romeu and in Mikel a player who will be missing for a month and a half over an extremely busy period. Not to forget two players in Lampard and Ramires possibly the complete opposite of what you want in that formation. What do the board do? Get rid of two viable rotation options. Essien leaves on loan and utterly bizarrely, Meireles leaves after the close of the transfer window in England. Why was this done? What was the thinking? Was it genuinely that we would be okay with four players for two spots? Who is accountable for this? Is it the manager? Is it the director of football? Is it the football board? Where is the responsibility? Who knows.

What responsibility are you going on about? 4 players for 2 spots is NOT enough? How many do we need to dedicate there? I will agree that I too don‚Äôt know why Meireles was offloaded. Perhaps because he‚Äôs an older player and we don‚Äôt want to spend time developing or paying him. As much as I love the bison, his time at Chelsea is over. Injuries have conquered him. I suppose we could have kept him for depth, but again on paper it‚Äôs not like we needed it. Objectively, we have more depth this season than in previous seasons, I can‚Äôt agree citing depth as a problem. 
&gt;The striking options - Torres and Sturridge, are both pathetic. Torres because he's finished as a footballer at the highest level and Sturridge because he hasn't got the mental fortitude to play for this club. Yet these are the only two options available to Roberto Di Matteo.

Well he also has Moses. I don‚Äôt like Torres as much as the next guy, but the thinking is that he would benefit from the players we buy. I don‚Äôt agree though, and I‚Äôll concede this point. 
&gt; He is replaced by a man suggested by Director of Football, Michael Emenalo. That man is Rafael Benitez, a man so utterly detested by the fans that they're in revolt. The man with the plan, with the grand scheme of what he wants his Chelsea to look like, sacked the man who had the fans on his side and who had given him all he wanted when he first found an interest in football in 2003. The man with the plan has divided the support with one move.

Are you talking about Abramovich? Are there really people who don‚Äôt want RA at Chelsea? Holy shit. We‚Äôre in a bad spot, I don‚Äôt agree with the RDM firing, and Benitez is bullshit. But RA has pulled through over and over in the past, I don‚Äôt see that changing anytime soon. We‚Äôll see how the summer unfolds.

So what do you want? Fire him? What‚Äôs happened has happened. I agree they made a mistake here, but you‚Äôre only summarizing the situation. What‚Äôs your solution here? Fire everybody at the top of the club?  
&gt;Players like Moussa Sissoko are ignored in favour of leaving things as they are, with two midfielders for two midfield spots. This is even without speaking of the 25 players we have out on loan. That's twenty five. Twenty five players on our books that we haven't found use for. Twenty five players some of whom could contribute right now. Twenty five players whom the football board have purchase yet cannot find use for.

This brings me to my point. On paper we have a squad with a lot of depth, so what happened? Well injuries and ACN. Without Romeu during Mikel‚Äôs absence, we have gone back to Lamps/Ramires. We‚Äôve also thrown in Luiz (which wasn‚Äôt so bad). But Mikel should be back soon, do we sign (in a January window) someone for the sake of cover for a few weeks? Isn‚Äôt that the very definition of panic buying, which you were against? Who on our loan sheet will fix our problems? KDB and McEachran would never start over Mata and Hazard. They‚Äôre both too raw to play a cdm role in the EPL. The only complaint here is that we should have kept Essien for ACN. I disagree that Lamps and Ramires are unable to play in the pivot. It‚Äôs just not working out so well when they play there together. We need someone a bit more defensive with distribution to transfer the ball forward, but is even Essien the answer for that?
(You go on and on about pleasing RA again)
&gt;Where is the plan? Are we playing 4-2-3-1? In that case, let's get some midfielders who can play in it, not three number 10s, a Brazilian who is the third man in a 4-3-3 and Frank Lampard, who has never played defensive midfielder in his life. Where is the communication to put the squad together? Where is the unanimity of setting out the plan?

Lamps has been playing in the pivot for about a year now. He did well last year, and in my opinion the double pivot is perfect for him. In a first team squad, Mikel would cover him as he marauds forward, and he can still pass the ball forward extremely well. Barring a high cost purchase, he‚Äôs the best we‚Äôve got in transitioning to offense (aside from maybe Luiz). The plan has been 4-2-3-1, and we have the squad for it. Why switch to 4-3-3 when we don‚Äôt have nearly the same depth for it? Maybe you‚Äôre talking about in the summer? Who are you going to sell to make room for that? For me, it‚Äôs clear we want to go 4-2-3-1 or 4-2-1-2-1 as we go forward. You‚Äôre upset that the new signings we have aren‚Äôt able to command the midfield yet. You‚Äôre expecting immediate synchronization when that‚Äôs just not going to happen. Give it at least a season. You don‚Äôt change football styles overnight.  
&gt; The owner surrounds himself with people who tell him what he wants to hear.

I have no insight on this, and I suspect you don‚Äôt either. Maybe EnglishMD has a better idea.

That said, and in all fairness, the two games aren't as similar as many would suggest. However, if rugby were played in the same fashion as footba -- err, 'gridiron,' then they'd need the same type of protective gear. If NFL players didn't wear the protection they do, there is no doubt that career-ending injuries and death would be much more frequent.

The big talk among the NFL right now is how to handle the effects of, and reduce, game-inflicted concussions. The larger reason for this is due to the increasing evidence that shows the link between severe and multiple concussions to mental illness/disorders (perhaps that's not the most appropriate term, but that's all I could think of). There are a growing number of current and former players who've taken their own lives because of how concussions have affected their mental health.

In short, I don't doubt the toughness of any rugby players. I'm somewhat familiar with the game and its culture, so I don't discount the brutality of the sport. And I'm also not saying rugby players are any less tough than football players, however, football, when played at its highest level, which is in the NFL, is possibly the most grueling, savage and physical sport there is.

true,Catemoon,null,null,"I'm just going to try to clarify here because there's a lot of misleading advice that's getting prominence. 

First, you need to see a DENTIST absolutely as soon as possible.

Without seeing you in person it's hard to tell, but it sounds like this tooth has been broken down to the pulp which is why it's hurting you so much: you have acute pulpitis. Without treatment this tooth is going to get infected and pretty soon you are going to have an abscess. 

The dentist may be able to assess and refer you without actually touching you. Tell him/her about your phobia calmly as soon as you enter the surgery. If antibiotics and/or pain relief are required, the dentist is likely to be able to diagnose this without touching you and give you an appropriate prescription. You should be offered an emergency NHS appointment with a dentist within 24 hours.

If I were the attending dentist, I would refer you as an emergency for treatment under sedation to stabilise this tooth. Under sedation, obviously the dentist carrying out the treatment would have to touch the tooth, and you, but you would find that you 'd feel much less anxious about it.

That would stop the pain. You would still need further treatment.

Your GP is the next port of call because your history suggests that you would benefit from psychiatric treatment.

Do NOT go to your GP first, he should just refer you to a dentist, and if he gives you antibiotics this will muddy the waters and complicate the subsequent diagnosis and treatment, which will need to be carried out by a dentist. 

You're almost certainly better not going to A&amp;E because although they may have a maxillofacial surgeon  (oral surgeon) on call, this is not an oral surgery issue, it's a dental surgery one, and you will be advised to go and see a dentist. 

You could try a dental school, but remember that these are teaching establishments and your treatment is likely to be a *lot* slower getting started and being followed through than it would be if initated by a practicing dentist, also all the students are going to want to have a look at you.

I do hope that helps. If I could see you myself I would.

&gt;Alli has used his political position to argue for gay rights. He spearheaded the campaign to repeal Section 28.[17] He advocated lowering the age of consent for homosexuals from 18 to 16, equal to heterosexuals; this eventually became law as the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000. It was during a heated exchange with conservative opponents, led by Baroness Young, that he informed his fellow peers that he was gay. In April 1999, he said in a speech, ""I have never been confused about my sexuality. I have been confused about the way I am treated as a result of it. The only confusion lies in the prejudice shown, some of it tonight [i.e. in the House], and much of it enshrined in the law.""[10]

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"I would be for a female Doctor (I've seen it done before, it's cool). Since Doctor Who is a show that rewrites itself you can do whatever. I'd point out the Corsair thing and River changing race.

For arguments against...

The Doctor has been **white male for 11 incarnations** and some people would feel it odd if he changed. It would be odd but I don't think that's a reason against it. Doctor Who has survived by the long cherished method of ""making stuff up as we go along"". It has no problem bringing in new/weird things or outright contradictions. For example, we had no idea he could regenerate for the first three years of the tv show. How radical would it be to change out the main cast member around whom all the mystery was centered? Yet they changed Hartnell into Troughton. Are we now saying that gender is such a big obstacle that it trumps changing main cast characters?

If we did get a female companion, in the long run years from now, fans of the future would understand exactly why the Doctor was white male for 11 incarnations and then suddenly female: It's the time period. The early 21st century/mid 20th century. The idea of transgenderism (as the Doctor's regeneration could be seen as) is pretty controversial and not widely accepted in today's society.

Some people feel that **gender is a very important part of the character** and believe that gender is one of the fixed aspects of society/their world and that it should not be tampered with (which is also partly why transgenderism is controversial). Personally I feel that gender is useless unless used in a binary (two options: male or female) way. If gender stopped being binary there would be no point in using it as a way to define people and the pressure of comments like ""because you're X gender you should like pink/blue"" would not be a thing.

Also I feel that the Doctor is not particularly masculine or feminine in a traditional sense. He's not athletic, impulsively aggressive, domineering. He's emotional, sensitive and intelligent. Things that all people can be (and should be imo; even if society goes around telling men they aren't allowed to cry). Including core traits like intelligence and sensitivity is the Doctor's eccentricity and optimism. These traits are (imo) essential to the character of the Doctor but they are not male-exclusive traits.

**People don't want the character to be a gimmick**, which is a fair concern. Doing a gender swap is a big move and a real minefield. We don't want the Doctor to be making a joke out of being female but also don't want it to be ignored. This one is all up to whether or not you trust the writers to do a good job. I don't know if I do.

Plus, **would anyone buy it?** I have a feeling that the casual audience would flip the heck out. People might cite this time period as the time when Doctor Who finally jumps the shark. There would be backlash. There would be people just waiting to see sexism where there is none (or maybe the writers suck at their jobs). It's a minefield. And this is why the BBC would never do it.

The **Doctor's relationships** is another concern. What would happen between he and River? How would the companion dynamic change? Well it'd sure be something interesting to explore, that's all I can say. Though we don't know River's sexuality preferences, she seems pretty open to me. Though you can have a romantic relationship without having a sexual one (it's called asexual romanticism as opposed to aromantic asexuality).

**Historical concern** is an issue. The Doctor would be at a disadvantage if she ever visited time periods on Earth (even today in some places) where women are treated poorly (um like all the time periods lol). It's like the crap Martha took as the Doctor took her to past time periods. It would be interesting. It might or might not be addressed. For one thing, sexism towards women in the past wouldn't be an issue if all the Earth stories we wrote about weren't set in European or post-European-contact societies or other societies that treat women as lessers. Also, how big of an issue has being female been for the Doctor's companions who go to past time periods? Not too much. The show glosses that stuff over or it gets a random comment somewhere.

**In spite of all of this** I would still be interested and would still give it a shot. Plus, there is a spin-off media character called **Iris Wildthyme** who travels through space and time in a red double decker bus that's smaller on the inside armed only with her intelligence and handy sonic corkscrew. She's a batty crazy older woman who likes to drink and has adventures. She's met the Doctor in alt. media and often her stories are parodies of his. In a meta sort of way, Iris seems to think she's had the same experiences as the Doctor (as if she is him) but she also knows her life is a parody of his. She comes from the Clockworks people (code for Time Lords) and is possibly from the Obverse (whatever that is). She's pretty much a female Doctor and great. All her stories are intentionally campy funny and fun but still maintain good writing. Iris is an awesome character and I encourage people to try out a story of hers to get an idea of a female Doctor. Plus she's played by **Katy Manning**, the actress who played Jo Grant, 3rd Doctor companion.

A **Reality Check**. I should just mention this. Besides sexism/racism, there are others reasons why a female/non-white Doctor isn't likely. Casting. Most people who audition are likely to be able white cisgendered British males. Because the show is made in Britain. And because Doctor Who is a product of Western society. We watch shows that reflect our culture. It's not diverse but it's not necessarily bad. It's like how there are American and British versions of The Office to deal with the humor differences in the two cultures. So too is Doctor Who a product of the culture it came from (see the sexual and gender politics of the 60s in Doctor Who for a reflection of culture). It's great to be idealistic about this stuff but we also just have to accept it. Though this doesn't mean we stop trying to push for diversity.

true,PhuQDuP,lfc99,,"I'll start by saying what a brilliant game we played.. I felt that we finally looked like a top 4 team. 
Suarez was playing his heart out as usual.

Sturridge was fantastic, lovely goal and just classy all the way through.

Downing linked up really well with midfield and our two superstars up front, though I'm not 100% convinced he's quite the first team material the rest of the sub does.

Gerrard was a sexy beast of a man today, his goal made me nostalgia so hard. That's the Gerrard I really know.

Lucas was solid, brilliant tackles, great passing, lovely stuff all around.

Hendo was also solid, not quite 100% yet, I think he has a lot more to offer.

Caragger were a big brick wall for the most part, if you just watched the 85 or so minutes that weren't a build up to a man city goal you'd have thought there was no way anything would get in.

Enrique worked his arse off, he ran up and down that pitch like it was his job. 

Johnson - maybe I missed some stuff but I hardly noticed him this game. Don't have much to say.

Reina.. oh Reina what will we do with you, horrible misplay from him absolutely cost us 2 points. I don't know what's been going on with this man but he needs to fix it quick. We need him in form as soon as possible. 


All in all, I think we played our game of the season, but in recent LFC fashion, a few crucial mistakes cost us massively. This game could have very easily been the game we would have looked back on and said ' and this game kids, is when we finally got over our hump' but alas, well have to wait. Probably until next season too when we play the scum or their blue cousins again.

That's a lot different from ""why do so many people like 10"", ""why does it seem like 10 is everyone's favorite"", etc. The way he has it phrased implies that it's a negative thing. ""Why do you think 10 is the only Doctor"" implies that everyone disregards the others, which definitely isn't true.

&gt;He's been off now for 3 years. Start drawing Matt Smith. I swear. I see barely ANY love for Nine and quite frankly not much for Eleven either.

Here he's flat out talking down about people who like 10 the most. The implication of the first sentence is ""he's been off for 3 years, why can't you get over it"". Hartnell has been off for almost 50 years, but he's not telling people to stop drawing him. In fact, he's saying the opposite, so it's clear and obvious that he has a thing specifically against 10 fans. His demand that they ""start drawing Matt Smith"" is ridiculous. People can draw whatever the hell they feel like drawing.

&gt;Don't even get me started on the classic Doctors. You'd think they never even existed the way it goes.

true,ScreamingGerman,null,null,"A lot of good points, can't speak to all of them but there's a few that I disagree with:

&gt; I can‚Äôt say we only had 4 people in midfield and casually throw in Zhirkov and the amazing Malouda. Malouda had 15g/15a in 09/10 so one would expect him to be playing in 10/11 as well. Turns out he was extremely important in the Ancelotti diamond and netted the club 13 goals (more than even Drogba) in 10/11. 

Whoa, Zhirkov and Malouda played excellently on the left wing (or left back, in the case of Zhirkov, although I believe Malouda made a cameo there too). They did not function will as the attacking midfielder in a 4-3-3 however, specifically in the year after we sold Ballack and Lampard was injured. We couldn't replace him and Ramires wasn't settled yet (loads of people hated him at that point, he wasn't playing that well then). You mention the diamond but we hardly ever played it. I think a bit in 2009 but after we shifted back to the 4-3-3, I don't think it saw much more until around Torres came in, but still only once or twice then. 

The overall point that DBFM was making was that we've allowed our midfield quality to gradually and consistently slip from around 2008 or 2009. We've let a lot of midfield players go and have done an extremely poor job at maintaining a very crucial part of any formation.

&gt; Ancelotti‚Äôs system just didn‚Äôt have long term potential, and with the board seeking a different style of play for Chelsea (something I have hated about by the way) following a poor display against United in the UCL he was let go. 

But that's a reflection of the vacuum at the top. We played poorly in the CL because we had to fit Torres in. We had to fit Torres in because Roman wanted him. We didn't need a striker then, it was a vanity signing and anyone except Roman could see that Torres was not the player that captured the world's attention. If we had someone legitimately good at their job they would have stood firm and not allowed Roman to make such a mistake, especially one as glaringly repetitive as the Sheva mistake.

&gt; You don‚Äôt get spoonfed and coddled just because you‚Äôre (relatively) young. Tough shit, he‚Äôs a grown man getting paid to do his job, if he can‚Äôt do it right it‚Äôs his fault. End of story.

End of the day, I agree with his sacking. He didn't handle his opportunity at Chelsea the right way. Don't think RDM was ever an elite coach and to be honest, should have been nothing more than an interim coach. Benitez makes me sick though, I'd still rather RDM than Rafa.

Overall I find your analysis of the midfield a bit simplistic. You toss in the attacking midfielders with the holding, box to box, or defensive ones too often, and the roles are too different. We don't have a lot of strong midfielders, ones that play well in a double pivot, ones that excel at transitioning from defense to attack quickly. We need more and we've ignored it for a long time. I'm extremely frustrated how weak we've allowed our midfield to become.

1) try talking him down - that failed

2) Hit him with a baton - Given the level of threat that is going to involve hitting about the head, given its a metal stick and hasn't got much give, that's going to be pretty lethal, not to mention he could stab the officer attempting this method so that's out.

3) baton gun - Too much risk of ricochet. could hit a member of the public.

4) CS Spray, not always effective, especially on persons displaying signs of mental health problems. Also it only induces pain, it would not immobilise even if successful. 

5) Police dog - dog could get harmed, dog could go for the wrong target (happens), dog could provoke man into stabbing himself.

7 - Firearm - very likely to be deadly, round could pass through, officer could miss, could be very harmful to members of the public. Threat level for use of firearm, questionable. He seems to be intent on harming others rather than himself and as such it would more or less defeat the point.

I don't get your point. Am I supposed to gloss over our poor defensive display on that play and just credit City's attacking play? It goes both ways. It was a nice intricate play by City and good movement by Dzeko, but the defensive positioning and marking was still poor from us.

true,hugies,NZ,new zealand,"&gt;Lamps has been playing in the pivot for about a year now. He did well last year, and in my opinion the double pivot is perfect for him. In a first team squad, Mikel would cover him as he marauds forward, and he can still pass the ball forward extremely well. Barring a high cost purchase, he‚Äôs the best we‚Äôve got in transitioning to offense (aside from maybe Luiz).

I have to disagree with this. Lampard doesn't function very well in the pivot.

The thing about the pivot is that you have to act as a really competent link player with some defensive duties, or a heavily defensive player that adds a bit with rotating the ball. Lampard obviously lacks in the defensive department, so he needs to act as the link.

What's the one area that we've absolutely struggled with this season? Link play.

He has been doing well when it comes to non-core duties like scoring, but the rest of the team is hampered by not having someone that acts as a deep lying playmaker. We look dangerous playing through the fullbacks, we look dangerous on the break, we look stale when the pivot is required to pick out the attacking 3.

Frank is a great player, but not suited to the tasks of the pivot.",0,1359923825,null,0,false,0,c88q89h,t3_17tggz,t1_c88q89h,t1_c88oa7b,null,1431172120,9,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,9
true,wxwax,null,null,"Hi DembaBaForMuhammad! A few thoughts in response.


In 2010-11, you forgot to mention midfielder Benayoun. If you recall, he was slated to be a regular until he ruptured his Achilles tendon on 22 September.


This January transfer window, you forgot to mention Demba Ba (odd, given your name! :) )


Last season, you forgot to mention that Chelsea also won the FA Cup. As we all know, since Roman bought the club Chelsea has been enormously successful. 1 European Cup, 3 League titles, 4 FA Cups, 2 League Cups.


With regard to Alex, Anelka, Malouda, Lampard, Cole, Drogba and Terry, these are difficult decisions. Stars get old and intelligent clubs move players a year too early rather than a year too late. Didier was fabulous at times last season, but more often than not he wasn't. Alex can't hold down a place at PSG. Malouda had 1.5 good seasons and was done years ago. Anelka was fading. Lampard should be worth a 1-year contract, although I have no idea if he'd accept a sort deal. Cole did, which is good.  


I never believed that Chelsea would be particularly successful this season. Therefore I'm not panicking at the recent run of poor results. We have very young, new players in important positions. It will take time for them to grow, to learn to play together and to learn the league. 


That said, I share your concern over the strategic plan. We all believe that Roman wants to be the Barcelona of the Premier League. But as you note, we now have three #10's, forcing two of them to play out of position. We didn't sign a striker in the summer. We have a serious problem in the pivot.


And overall we now have tiny players who are pushed off the ball every single match. If you want to find the source of Chelsea's defensive problems, I'd say that's a good place to start. We have a hard time possessing the ball when the opposition marking is tight and physical. 


I worry about the role that Emanelo plays. I hope the club isn't putting its future in the hands of a man with so little experience. Frank Arnesen couldn't deliver and was encouraged to shuffle off to Hamburg. I wonder if this season might be the undoing of Emanelo?


Chelsea truly has a tin ear when it comes to its image. For me, it all comes down to Abramovich. Marketing, caring about the public, has never been a part of his business success. I think that explains the ruthless manner with which Chelsea sometimes conducts its business. 


Lastly, the way Roman goes through managers is indefensible. Of them all, Ancelotti is the one that still makes no sense to me. I thought AVB was given a difficult hand and the young man went on to misplay it badly. (I lost a lot of respect for Lampard and Terry for how they conducted themselves.) 


I'm glad that Chelsea fans have asserted themselves over the DiMatteo/Benitez fiasco. My hope is that Roman (for it is he who makes all the major decisions) has learned something and might be a bit more thoughtful in the future.


But let's face it: our club is owned and run by a reclusive Russian oligarch who made his fortune cutting backroom deals with a corrupt government.

And it's not that the board didn't try either. We circled around Modric and there was the Pastore issue as well. Both of those players would have been superb in link up play, but we couldn't pay that much for Pastore and getting a vital player from a direct competitor was a stretch.

My point was more that for the players we have, Lamps does the link job fairly well. He's no Alonso sure, but he picks out the long passes, spreads the ball when necessary, and is capable of switching when necessary. He is old though, so I give you that he doesn't defend or counter as fast as we need.

He basically says he is voting personally and that he made up his mind a long time ago back in May 2012 and that it should not be a party political line or something.

Here is an excerpt about his reasons:
&gt;From my personal perspective, when I entered into a Church of England marriage with my wife 20 years ago this July, and with my father presiding as the local rector, it was a tremendously special and solemn occasion. It was characterised by the part of the Church of England marriage service which defines marriage as:

&gt;‚Äòa gift of God in creation through which husband and wife may know the grace of God.

&gt;It is given as the foundation of family life in which children are born and nurtured.‚Äô

&gt;I hope you will see, therefore, why it is difficult for me to accept that the solemnity of marriage as a religious institution can be anything other than between a man and a woman, and particularly where all the rights and responsibilities of marriage are now available to non-heterosexual couples through civil partnerships. I do not see why we need to change the law and I also do not see why we need to change the law at this time when there are so many other important matters for the Government to be addressing.

We didn't need a striker then, it was a vanity signing and anyone except Roman could see that Torres was not the player that captured the world's attention. If we had someone legitimately good at their job they would have stood firm and not allowed Roman to make such a mistake, especially one as glaringly repetitive as the Sheva mistake.

But this is an attack of Roman, not the hierarchy of the club. No matter who was there, they would not have said ""No Roman, I'm gonna do what I want to do."" If Roman is the type of man to get what he wants and control everything in the club, do you honestly believe anyone would be hired to oppose him? All of that Torres nonsense can be assigned to Roman. If Roman is who you all say he is, you should be upset with Roman. You can't say he hired yesmen, the yesmen didn't say no to Roman, and then blame the yesmen. Blame Roman.

&gt;The overall point that DBFM was making was that we've allowed our midfield quality to gradually and consistently slip from around 2008 or 2009. We've let a lot of midfield players go and have done an extremely poor job at maintaining a very crucial part of any formation.

Maybe, but Chelsea went overboard in that department lately. We've also started focusing more on youth and the focus has shifted undeniably from established players. Keeping that in mind, it would be hard to replace the legends we had pre-09 with simply prospects. Of course it will decrease in quality.

In terms of consistency, well, that I would chock up to the changing styles that comes with changing managers. I won't go into who should and should not have been fired, but I'd point out that we've been winning things all the while. Was it short term success? I don't think so.

true,Uniform764,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;I would like to understand whose rights you think would be trodden on if gay marriage were legalised.

Unless I'm very much mistaken, in the proposed bill, same sex couples would be entitled to both secular and religious marriage, although the latter would be dependant on the consent of the religious institution concerned. How long would it be before those religious institutions that hadn't consented are pressured to do so? They're already painted as bigoted and backward (with some accuracy, in all fairness).

It's not beyond the realms of possibility that a later law could force those religions to allow homosexual marriages in their instiutions. Another issue is if a registar who was from a religion opposed to homosexual marriage was forced to perform the ceremony for a homosexual couple? One could very well argue that it's their job, but there was a sizable political battle in the Netherlands where that was the exact situation recently.

Personally I don't have an issue with gay marriage, I'd like to see them get the same rights and privelages and heterosexual couples, but I also understand that a large number of people, some religious, some not disagree with the issue and that it's not as simple as I'd like it to be. 

My major reason for not knowing the answer is that I'm in favour of both gay rights and the freedom to hold religious beliefs/convictions freedom and on this particular issue the two clash.",0,1359925043,null,0,false,0,c88qlw8,t3_17sv3t,t1_c88qlw8,t1_c88qd0p,null,1431172298,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,otterdam,cnty-uk,Lahndahn,"The irksome part is people downvoting when you're simply trying to understand something. People who reply generally are light on the downvotes. However, your reply disappoints because your moral compass is quite extreme, so I'm unlikely to see your point. e.g. Most people have no issue with pets a.k.a. animals in captivity. I myself have three rescued ferrets, an animal which simply cannot survive in the wild - does this make their existence immoral?

I'm trying to approach a vegan lifestyle in fact, which is easy in some ways (no more leather shoes) and hard in others (diet), but it is an emotive subject. One thing you will notice is that people consider you the awkward one, since they have to factor your lifestyle choices in to their plans. The default position within Western society is to eat meat, and people's understanding of nutrition is predicated on that. So it is difficult.

Since you are smart enough to understand moral consequentialism, I was hoping you would see the point that, as something which is ultimately unworkable day-to-day, it is inconsistent to then rag on one group because they aren't doing *enough* to be moral. We can all do more than we currently are. Your mistake is to see that as a moral judgment rather than the problem of being born into a system built on exploitation, the power of which cannot be overcome by one person. Unless you're sold on the idea of original sin, of course.

For what it's worth, I believe you are committing an appeal to nature with your view that it is immoral to keep animals captive, the corollary being that animals should only run wild as nature intended.",0,1359926986,null,0,false,0,c88r6rh,t3_17r6jh,t1_c88r6rh,t1_c88b8t1,null,1431172571,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

If Roman is the type of man to get what he wants and control everything in the club, do you honestly believe anyone would be hired to oppose him? All of that Torres nonsense can be assigned to Roman. If Roman is who you all say he is, you should be upset with Roman. You can't say he hired yesmen, the yesmen didn't say no to Roman, and then blame the yesmen. Blame Roman.

I don't disagree with you there, Roman, despite all he's done for the club is far from a perfect owner and he has made some mistakes. His vanity signings have been utter shit, have cost us a few good managers and maybe a few titles as well.

&gt; Maybe, but Chelsea went overboard in that department lately. We've also started focusing more on youth and the focus has shifted undeniably from established players. Keeping that in mind, it would be hard to replace the legends we had pre-09 with simply prospects. Of course it will decrease in quality.

We have a lot of prospects but are still undeniably thin in terms of midfield prospects. We have McEachran and Chalobah - only two outside of the first team (so not including Romeu). Neither fully replace the talent we've lost, Makalele, Essien, Ballack most notably.

Hopefully we can pry Modric away from Real Madrid, although a 27 year old might not be the best bet. Would love for it to be McEachran, but he is at least 2 seasons away from competing for a spot in earnest.

The pivot is the making or breaking of the 4-2-3-1 for me. In Mikel we have a really solid DM, but there is nobody in the squad that is the right player for the other pivot, it really should've been a priority to find someone in the window (especially with Romeu out for the rest of the season, and Lampard leaving in the summer).

The one aspect that I wonder about is how FFP is shaping the squad decisions. In Terry, Lampard, and Torres you have a whole heap of expenditure tied up which restricts what you can do with the rest of the squad. Lampard's wages could probably pay for 2 players that are more suited to the pivot, or one excellent pivot with some leftovers.

When you score from a counter you are usually only facing 5 defenders and catching them off guard. Our clearest chances and a few of our goals have come from counter attacks as well. Its just easier. However BR focuses on possession play. meaning that more likely than not we will not take a chance with a counter attack and instead hold up play and pass the ball back all the way to the CB's before starting an attack again. This means the opposition has also has time to set up, which is why we can't score goals from in the box and many of our goals are not ""clear cut."" we are usually forced to the wing which means a cross or a cut in and shot. Playing through the middle is still something we are working on. It takes speed, brains, bags of technique, and most of all Team chemistry and trust. Right now we lack Speed and team chemistry. Hopefully those will come in time. 

Also, goals from outside the box are pretty clear to me. even if you don't score you make a chance for a tap in off a blocked shot. ",0,1359928682,null,0,false,0,c88roky,t3_17trgf,t1_c88roky,t3_17trgf,null,1435634275,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

&gt;Sky TV

What is so wrong with Sky TV? It's ¬£30 a month, right? And the package includes Internet and phoneline usually?

¬£30 a month for all that entertainement is an INCREDIBLY good deal. That's less than ¬£8 a week. That is not a big expense. 

Personally, I think you may be prejudiced, because Sky is judged to be a 'nice thing' and you somehow don't think poor people can or should have 'nice things'.

&gt;iPhones

Are you just using this to mean smartphones in general?

Next season when the team is more comfortable with the system and new signings start blending in, I hope we can put in a decent challenge for a Champions League spot.

For the remainder of this season I hope that we continue to improve and integrate Coutinho into the squad. A nice stab at the Europa League would be great too.

Imagine what ¬£33k could do if your 3 bedroom house was worth what is was actually worth? ¬£50k and your not paying income tax, council tax or national insurance.

The rental market alone would become far more agressive with quality rather than price being the important selling factor. First time buyers could easily afford a home without the 25 year slog and massive deposits.

I'm talking about wealth creation still existing for any lucky/hardworking/talented enough to create it simultaneously lifting 20 odd million people out of almost poverty and creating new growth in all sectors as this massive block of people have more money to spend.

I understand this type of shock to the system change will probably not happen as the people in power would be the most affected. The middle class is shrinking the rich are getting vastly richer. The poorest in sthe UK who work shifts all week on minimum wage to afford ¬£125 ppw rents ¬£35 council tax then 27% income tax and national insurance shouldn't have to take the brunt, the richest in society should.

This requires however that we use Mikel as the other CDM, Lampard  simply doesn't cut it defensively and Luiz would be too much of a liability with this setup as Oscar would be linking up forward.

&gt;Why should my tax money pay for someone else to have Sky TV?

Question: Where's the cutoff line with this 'Why should my tax money pay for X?' stuff?

&gt;Why can I not afford to provide Sky TV for my wife and daughter because I have a mortgage to pay whilst the man over the road doesn't work and yet pays no rent?

If he's not paying rent that means he'd be homeless otherwise. The implication seems to be that you think this man should be homeless.

&gt;What about me?

What *about* you? You've got a job, a house, a car, probably disposable income, and (most importantly) a wife and daughter who presumably love you very much. Woe is you!

&gt;A welfare system should support people with the basics

Define 'the basics'. Does that cover furniture? How about heating, since people can just wear additional clothes for warmth (assuming additional clothes for winter comes under 'the basics'). And what about food? What food comes under 'the basics' and what doesn't? 

I'm not sure you have any idea what you actually want.

&gt;not whilst they avoid taking the available jobs because they want something else. 

Sure, but you are overestimating the number of people who abuse the system, and the demands behind your grievances ('poor people can't have X or Y, why should my money pay for X or Y') would only hurt and further shame the people who genuinely need it.

I would change the political system substantially. England would be split into north, south and greater London. London would function much like Washington DC. North and South would each get their own parliament in Birmingham and York. The representatives from each of the 5 parliaments Would make up the national government located in London. Voting would not be first past the post, probably similar to AV to encourage wider party distribution. 

I would probably invest heavily in nuclear power as well along with renewables to get rid of the current fossil fuel heavy supply.

Education, on a social side of things are a bit weak. Personal responsibility and independence will be focused on heavily this includes making good informed decisions about drugs, sexuality, relationships and personal safety both on and off the net. Also independence with respect to finding and keeping a job and maintaining a health body, environment and mind. 

P.E. Will encourage participation in a wide range of activities outside of school, but will also teach the biology and sociology of exercise to emphasise its role in life.  To increase the range of sports, equipment sharing between schools should be key.

Can't think of anything else at the moment.

Legal and social benefits would be conferred solely to 'civil unions,' a 'marriage' would confer benefits only within the religious realm.

This, to me, seems a perfectly rational way of doing things. The problem with this is that people have an irrational attachment to the term 'marriage.' However, like this proposed bill that would not prevent closed-minded churches refusing to perform marriage ceremonies for same-sex couples, my proposal would not prevent open-minded churches being able to confer the title of marriage.

true,thewaitaround,k9,K-9,"Sorry for lack of source to back this up, but there was one comment on this subreddit a few months back that I really liked which totally justified it for me, but I can't remember exactly what it said. Someone had pointed out an image of a Statue of Liberty some point earlier in the episode, which, invoking the whole ""the image of an angel becomes an angel"" thing, would mean that the Statue that Rory and Amy face is not the ""real"" Statue of Liberty, but  simply the aforementioned image of the Statue in Angel form. I will do more research to try and link to the comment. 

Personally I had a bigger problem with the fact that there were at least two instances where no one was looking at the Liberty Angel, and yet it didn't move at all. I can't say any DW thing, plot hole or otherwise, has really killed my suspension of disbelief though; in the end, I'd generally prefer great storytelling and imagery with a few minor plot holes over an overly convoluted story which forcibly irons out any possible plot hole that a fanbase so rabid as Doctor Who's could possibly find. I don't think people often give the DW team enough credit for just how difficult writing interesting and original time travel sci-fi is.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Honestly, how much money does a rifle range take to run? It's basically just a long room

You have maintenance/upkeep of the weapons to take into account, since I doubt many MPs have FACs or bring their weapons into work with them. This requires at least one armourer. One salary, plus expenses due to wear and tear.

Then you have a range attendant or officer to oversee the safe usage of the range, which is another salary.

Then you have ammunition costs, which are not by any means insignificant, if not provided for by the people shooting (they're MPs - what's your guess going to be?). Then range upkeep, the purchasing of targets and maintenance of the range mechanisms - often indoor ranges require mechanised trolleys to take the targets out and be repaired when shots go wide and damage them. This might require another party or overseer to ensure that the backstop is safe and secure, along with the structural integrity of the roofing, floor, and dividers.

There's also the fact that you needn't necessarily be in possession of a firearms certificiate if shooting, which means that one of the above attend or another person in possession of an FAC oversees the shooting and provides tutelage.

Without any information this is speculation and at many ranges around the UK these tasks may well be undertaken by volunteers, but I'm willing to bet that at an indoor range under the houses of parliament the parameters would be stricter.

Since they didn't have time to know 9 too well, 10 helped define WHAT and WHO the doctor is and should be. The change to 11 killed their idea of the doctor since no two doctors are the same - and it's hard to cope with.
