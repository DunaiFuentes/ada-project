Pre-comment TL;DR: I have too much time on my hands and think way too hard about Doctor Who, or maybe not enough? I'll be marking everything as spoilers by the way, read at your own peril.

[As well as many of the events that occurred were also leading up to the introduction of the Silence, its very well possible that one of the Silence infiltrated the TaRDiS and subsequently, not knowing how to fly it, simply blew it up on accident. The reason no one would remember/know who was controlling it can be explained by the Silences' signature feature of not being remembered once looked away from, as they had never shown reference to knowing of the Silences' existence.](/spoiler)

As for Clara, I have two theories, both revolving around the 50th Special with Tennant and Piper. 

Theory one: [Ten and Rose met Ten's future self at one point, but, due to some [currently] unforeseen reason (which could be what the 50th is centered around) Eleven has to wipe Ten and Rose's memories to forget the encounter so that it can play out properly in Ten's future without issue, hence Clara's apparent signature phrase ""Run you clever boy, and remember.""](/spoiler)

Theory two: [The Doctor has forgotten about the clone that Donna created during The Parting of Ways and Journey's End, when she touched the Doctor's dismembered hand. Ten left the half-human clone with Rose in the alternate universe, and since then, they may have accidentally bumped into Eleven and Clara for some unknown reason, except to the Doctor himself, who has forgotten, again incurring Clara's catch phrase.](/spoiler)

Through both of these theories, I also feel there may be some connection to:

[The Doctor's granddaughter, Susan, who has actually been mentioned (for once, as he has only ever mentioned being a parent, not a grandparent) in The Rings of Akhaten, as well as possibly the Doctor's clone ""daughter"" from The Doctor's Daughter, seeing as he doesn't know that she survived.](/spoiler)

true,Pergatory,k9,K-9,"&gt; It can't have been everything the doctor did, because the world would have ended 100 times over before Amy's wedding.

Not exactly. Keep in mind that Amy's parents were erased too, but Amy didn't vanish. She simply couldn't remember her parents anymore, and became an impossible child of parents who never existed. If everything her parents did was erased, Amy would've been erased as well.

So the things the Doctor did wouldn't have been undone by his erasure, it's just that nobody would remember him having done them until Amy brought him back.

This is one of those examples that really shows the danger of interacting with your own personal past. For example, let's say that after the universe rebooted, but *before* Amy remembered the Doctor back into existence, River used her vortex manipulator to take Amy back in time to where the Doctor chased the Atraxi off the planet. At that specific point in time, the Doctor has been erased from the universe, and Amy hasn't had her chance to remember him back again. The Atraxi were still chased away from Earth somehow, but it wasn't the Doctor who did it. This is a paradox. I think that if River had even *attempted* to do this, it would've torn the web of time to shreds, destroying the universe. However, now that the Doctor has been remembered, she could theoretically go back and observe him chasing off the Atraxi again.

true,lost_my_bearings,null,null,"As always, it will depend on the type of Zombie outbreak and whether or not we're prepared for it. Living in a large city is dangerous and diminishes our chances of survival. Simply having a place to run to when everything starts is not a good strategy.

Let's consider the two most common scenarios. We could be talking about scientific fast zombies. Those that are living people who get infected by some disease and go about biting and eating other living uninfected people. Or we can have Romero-like Zombies. These are slow Zombies and we can't really explain their origin. We just know that people die and come back in a weird state that leaves them with an unquenchable hunger for human flesh.

If it's the first case, then there's not much we can do living in Edinburgh, seeing as we're living in a large city and all. Chaos would ensue and the disease would spread quickly. But we're not in such a bad location. London would be worse. The best option would be to pack your survival kit and go for the mountains or the islands. Some place where you can barricade yourself and sustain yourself for a long period of time. I would say go North, maybe even the Shetlands, if you know the terrain. Either way, it will be a matter of luck whether you make it there or not and that's why you have to act fast.

If we're talking about the second case, then your plan might work in the short term. But which supermarket would you go to? I know a couple that have roof access, but you would inevitably get surrounded by a herd and if there's a breach, you'd have no form of defense. Your best option is to get out of the city during the initial chaos. Don't use a car. Everyone will try to do that and roads will be jammed. Find a motorcycle and head North or an island.

In both scenarios, I figure your chances of survival will increase if you're surrounded by water, especally if there's a fortress in it. Scotland is a good place for that. It's not clear what happens in that scenario, though. If the creatures can chase you in the water, you're better off in some sort of castle in a mountainous less crowded area. It'll be easier for them to scatter while wandering after human flesh. In the disease case, they might even die out in the mountains. Also, Remember that your destination should not only prevent Zombies from invading it, but it should allow you to survive isolated from the outside world. You should have some terrain to farm and keep animals. You can try to save water from the rain. There's plenty in Scotland.

But in either case you have to hurry to your selected stronghold and assume some leadership position or be in the inner circle of the leader. If you take too long, other people will claim that territory and they won't let you in. If they let everyone in, they won't be able to produce food and water for everyone. You'll end up on the outside roaming and scavenging and your chances of survival in the long term will decrease.

Going for the mountains is a controversial decision. I agree that you'll never make it if you're simply running there with a backpack filled with snacks and a few weapons. But I think it's your best option if you have planned it ahead. With that in mind, my advice for Edinburgh (and any other city, for that matter) is to plan ahead. Have a Zombie survival kit ready, a quick getaway vehicle and a destination. When it starts get out of the city as quick as possible. Good luck!

**tl;dr** Plan ahead and get out of Edinburgh.

true,ThePaisleyLady,donna,Donna,"I'm glad we agree about Rose.  I am also glad that you were able to enjoy Amy, where so many of us weren't.  I really don't think this is about me being ""right"" or ""wrong"" about Amy.  It's an opinion, and trust me, I've given it a lot of thought.  

There are a few points in what you said that I would like to contest though.  You cite the star whale episode as one of her strong points.  To me, it was the beginning of disliking her.  She watches the video, and like so many others, she chickens out and opts to forget.  Selfish, cowardly Amy strikes for the first time.  He was right to be so angry with her.  Yes, she  figures it out and fixes it, but that's just her thing, isn't it?  She messes up and then has to scramble to fix it.  A lot of Amy supporters in this thread are saying this is one of her strong points, that she is flawed and makes mistakes.  I agree that those are marks of a good character, but Amy never seems to learn.  She just keeps on stubbornly refusing to listen to anyone else until after the fact.  

You then mention her shooting the astronaut child as a good thing, because she is doing it to save the Doctor.  Horrible!  He was begging her not to!  She didn't even try to investigate what was going on before she pulled the trigger.  Again, impulsive to the point of stupidity.  Being willing to murder a child for the Doctor does not win her points in my book.  

As for the Rory divorce thing, why, WHY does she find it so hard to talk to him?  He was with her, he searched for her, he loves her.  I'm married, and I tell my husband the truth, every time, even if I know it will hurt him.  Why?  Because I respect him enough to at least be honest.  Even being traumatized, he should have been her rock.  But in my eyes, it isn't until the very end of their run that she begins to respect him and love him in return, and at that point, they'd been married for several years.  Honestly, I think what she really needed was a heap more of psychiatric help.  

I think where we most disagree is that in your opinion, her unwavering dedication to the Doctor is a strength.  To me, she pushes everything in the real world away in favor of what is largely a fantasy.  She refuses to grow up.  Despite what others in the thread have been saying, I truly believe that her objective during her first season was seeing if she could get the Doctor to fall in love with her.  If he had reciprocated, I think she would have left Rory in the dust, and never returned.  People seem to be trying to excuse this by saying that Rory is boring and that he is forcing her into a dull life by settling down.  Well then, she shouldn't have accepted his proposal.  All the time, their entire lives (up until ""Angels Take Manhattan"") she is *just using him*.

Also, the ""stupid-face"" episode?  Again, in my opinion, Amy chooses that horrible, hurtful wording (""one day you just fell out of the sky..."") in order to see what Rory would do, and catch him doubting her.  It's manipulative and abusive.  Rory did NOT fall from the sky, they've known each other since childhood.  She scares him to death and then makes him believe she doesn't love him.  Just to get a one up on him.  It's despicable.

I think, perhaps at this point, you are thinking ""Man, this woman can't see reason"".  But honestly, I have watched every single Amy episode and that's how I felt about it the whole way through.  Why on earth would I want to ""hate Amy""?  Nobody goes into a new season of their favorite show wanting to hate it.  I wanted to love her!  I wanted her to improve!  Instead, it never gets better.  Yes, she does brave things in the face of physical danger.

It also has to do with how I only appreciate River and the Doctor's relationship because it is textually acknowledged to be dysfunctional. Even though River may sometimes romanticize their relationship it is always in the context that we are reminded how young she is at that point in their timeline and that she is a fairly messed up person. It's about two seriously messed up people trying to work for something functional rather than something idyllic. Rose's relationship with the Doctor was worse in most of the same ways River and the Doctor's is bad (oh my goodness communication issues and power imbalances and the Doctor's occasional self hatred) and it was never acknowledged by either party that there were any problems. And the way Tennant chose to play the scene on the beach at the end of *Journey's End* really disturbed me. This is hard to articulate; you either get it or you don't. 

But really most importantly, nothing bothers me more from either a personal or feminist perspective than romanticizing being needed over wanted, and I think that is definitely the case in Rose's relationship with the Doctor. It's always talked about in terms of the Doctor needing Rose. Or Rose needing the Doctor. They are co-dependent in a way that is never dealt with; we are nearly actively asked to ignore it. 

This is something I am fairly interested in discussing, if you have any insight or comments or questions. (I'll try not to be mean or shame anyone for liking Rose/Doctor--their are substantially more messed up relationships in fiction that people think are romantic and wonderful.)",0,1366136319,null,0,false,0,c9gfadj,t3_1cgnio,t1_c9gfadj,t1_c9gerka,null,1431536404,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

[Here is the thread for reference purposes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1cgkic/clara_and_the_tardis/)

Pre-comment TL;DR: I have too much time on my hands and think way too hard about Doctor Who, or maybe not enough? I'll be marking everything as spoilers by the way, read at your own peril.

[As well as many of the events that occurred were also leading up to the introduction of the Silence, its very well possible that one of the Silence infiltrated the TaRDiS and subsequently, not knowing how to fly it, simply blew it up on accident. The reason no one would remember/know who was controlling it can be explained by the Silences' signature feature of not being remembered once looked away from, as they had never shown reference to knowing of the Silences' existence.](/spoiler)

As for Clara, I have two theories, both revolving around the 50th Special with Tennant and Piper. 

Theory one: [Ten and Rose met Ten's future self at one point, but, due to some [currently] unforeseen reason (which could be what the 50th is centered around) Eleven has to wipe Ten and Rose's memories to forget the encounter so that it can play out properly in Ten's future without issue, hence Clara's apparent signature phrase ""Run you clever boy, and remember.""](/spoiler)

Theory two: [The Doctor has forgotten about the clone that Donna created during The Parting of Ways and Journey's End, when she touched the Doctor's dismembered hand. Ten left the half-human clone with Rose in the alternate universe, and since then, they may have accidentally bumped into Eleven and Clara for some unknown reason, except to the Doctor himself, who has forgotten, again incurring Clara's catch phrase.](/spoiler)

Through both of these theories, I also feel there may be some connection to:

[The Doctor's granddaughter, Susan, who has actually been mentioned (for once, as he has only ever mentioned being a parent, not a grandparent) in The Rings of Akhaten, as well as possibly the Doctor's clone ""daughter"" from The Doctor's Daughter, seeing as he doesn't know that she survived.](/spoiler)

If they did, the two Amy's are as distinct as the Pete's. Otherwise, I'd say that Old Amy belongs to pre-Event Collapse Universe, and New Amy belongs to Post-Pandorica Universe, and the two are completely different people (Total event Collapse means that in a very cause-effect like way, Old Amy's universe came before New Amy's universe, hence while the same things happen, they don't happen to the same people).",0,1366136803,null,0,false,0,c9gfh4r,t3_1cgkic,t1_c9gfh4r,t1_c9gfbk7,null,1431536315,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

It would be a significant shock to the audience.  Doctors generally (some exceptions I know) stick around for several seasons.  I think a female doctor (unless PERFECT, and even there it would be an issue) would make the series feel seriously disjointed.  The writers would have to spend some serious time acclimating the audience to a female doctor, as well as answering the question: how many times do you make the doctor female? Is this permanent?

Why did the end of *Journey's End* bug you? It bugged me but I fear it was for different reason. I know you said it was hard to articulate but I would like to clarify.

I will admit that there were definitely some communication issues with the Doctor and Rose. I think I put that off because I figured the Doctor would never talk about the things that were bugging him even if Rose asked. I think the most telling moment for their relationship is in *School Reunion* when Rose finally snaps and asks him if that's what he does--just dump his companions. That I believe is when I fully appreciated their relationship. It was the one time he let her in on the grief and pain he felt, everyday. They are definitely co-dependent but that is something I love. She needed him as much as he needed her, that's why it works.

Please go back and watch the star whale episode again, but pretend its donna, or someone else in this situation. You have to understand, there is more then a million people on this ship (who all make the same choice she does btw). The second the doctor knows the truth, he has an absolute decision to make. 

""The Doctor: 'Cause you knew if we stayed here I'd be faced with an impossible choice. Humanity or the alien. You took it upon yourself to save me from that. And that was wrong, You don't ever decide what I need to know.
Liz Ten: What are you doing? 
The Doctor: The worst thing I ever do. I'm going to pass a massive electrical charge through the Star Whale's brain. It should knock over his high functions. Leave it a vegetable. The ship will still fly but the whale won't feed it.
Amy: That will be like killing it.
The Doctor: Three options. One, I let the Star Whale continue in unendurable agony for hundreds more years. Two, I kill everyone on this ship. Three, I murder a beautiful, innocent creature as painlessly as I can. And then I find a new name 'cause I won't be The Doctor anymore.
Amy: There must be something we can do. Some other way.
The Doctor: Nobody talk to me. Nobody human has anything to say to me today!""

Just take that single setup on its own merit. forget everything else in the entire world, and focus on this once single instance. The doctor is face with a choice that goes against everything he believes in. this is another impossible choice he had to make in Season 1 for the finale, and a decision he could not make. he was incapable of destroying lives to save other lives. And now he is put in an even worse situation then that one. Now he's in a situation where even if he can't kill the humans, he is directly torturing that animal for the rest of his life. He can never ever ever live with that decision.

Now look at amy's choice as to what it really is. Listen to her panicked message to herself. this wasn't a ""I'm a selfish coward"" move, this is a ""OH SHIT, IF THE DOCTOR SEES THIS IT WILL COMPLETELY DESTROY HIM. I CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN"" move. If she just opted to forget, she would not have left herself that message. This was a move to protect the doctor, and the doctor can be mad because it goes against everything he stands for, but this is a move that billions of people make every singel day. the choice to protect the ones they care about from harm. Its a human response, and you have done it thousands of times. Imagine a mother stopping bambi before the point it gets sad. Is the mother a selfish and cruel person for trying to protect their child? No. Its the same thing in this situation. Put yourself in this situation. You know that if the doctor finds out about this, it will end horribly. You know that if the doctor faces this choice, it will destroy him. Are you telling me you wouldn't try your hardest to protect him from this? this was a move of compassion, not cowardice. Recognize that, please. (The first time I saw it, I was like, ""YOU BITCH, thats not your job"" but watching it over, I see exactly why she made that choice, I would have tried to do the same thing, because the doctor would have been destroyed.)

Your conflicts with your husband might have hurt him a bit, but have you ever faced a potential relationship ender? Sure, its a lot easier to tell him that your mad at him for doing x, or that you don't want to do x, or that x is bothering or, or anything like that. But have you had to look him in the face and tell him that you cheated on him? Have you had to look in him in the face and know that what you are about to say will forever change how he sees you? thats not an easy choice, and I don't think i could do it. Just take a second, and think about doing this with your husband. this isn't a ""I forgot to pick up your mom from the airport"" mistake. this is a ""He's never going to see me the same again"" situation. Do you have kids? are you trying for kids? If you have kids, imagine the point where you both were trying to have kids desperately, and you checked when you were ovulation, and everything to try and have kids. Imagine if one day you had to look him in the eye and say ""Its never going to happen"". And if you don't have/don't want to have kids, imagine going up to your husband, and looking him straight in the eye, and saying that you cheated on him, or that you killed your co-worker today. Just imagine the look of disappointment on his face, imagine him looking at you like he doesn't even know you anymore. Could you actually face that? I know that I couldn't, and I'm not even married....

She started out pushing everything in the real world away in the beginning to live out a fantasy, but soon realized that wasn't what she wanted in her life. She is the one (not rory, or the doctor) that chose to travel with the doctor less and less, and instead live a normal life, with her husband. She told the doctor that he will always be her best friend, but she wanted to live a normal life with her husband. This was long before her choice at the very end to go back in time with rory. She grew up.

When you were in college, did you never do wild and crazy things? Did you not change what you wanted to do with your life multiple times growing up? Think back to your childhood, and the one thing you always wanted by never got? Imagine that times a million and realize what this meant to amy. Hell, imagine how happy you would be now if the doctor showed up to take you and your husband away to explore the universe and multiple that times every single day that she waited. She got to live her fantasy, but she also grew up in the process. It first started out as a happy dream, but she soon discovered that as amazing as it was to have her childhood dream come true, none of that compared to life with rory, and so she eventually told the doctor that she wanted more time with him, and less time traveling.

If your holding the horrible wording against her. PLEASE STOP. That was a blatant hollywood move that I've seen at least a hundred thousand times by now ""Make them thing your talking about one thing, and then mean something else entirely"" overplayed, hollywood bullshit and nothing else. That was a tiny little plot twist thrown in there to try and add more excitement to the episode (and it worked for most people). Don't let hollywood's bullshit fool you, please.

Please, just go back and watch the episodes again, but don't think about hating her, or anything else. Imagine her as if she was a little girl still, just now experiencing the world.

Stewart lee is great at making you think about another view point. Not great at being correct from every view point. Especially the working class point of view. 

The point Lee was really making (I think) is that everyone should have access. Not just the rich West end crowd who only care about money anyway. 

If a working class kid wants money via a degree then let him have access. If he wants to learn about nordic literature for fun then let him.

true,Galerath,null,null,"**The current issues facing the UK (as opposed to the Credit Crunch) are essentially as follows:**

1: There is low confidence in the economy. This means that investments aren't being made - investors are ""bearish"" and saving rather than spending. 

2: We're still feeling the repercussions of the credit crunch. One of the big reasons the economy isn't moving is that businesses are finding it hard to borrow. They used to borrow from investment banks that went bust back in 2008, and the remaining banks are being punished by governments for making such a huge mess and are being forced to save money rather than invest it, so businesses are finding it hard to find other lenders.

3: Our major trading partners are in the same position, so our exports are slowing and we can't get more money into the economy that way.

4: Our government has a ""structural deficit"". A deficit is when spending is larger than income, but this isn't necessarily bad if you're spending money on things that will make you lots more money tomorrow (such as infrastructure). The government however is having to borrow money just to go about it's usual business as a government, and that means that our National Debt is skyrocketing.

5: We have a big national debt. That is all the money owed by government on government bonds (which are essentially loans). This is increasing at a frightening rate due to 4. The more we owe the more the government has to pay on interest every year.

6: We have an aging population. This means that there are more and more old people compared to young people, and of course it's young people who are employed and do most of the actual wealth creation that drives the economy. Old people cost money - they have pensions and they get sick and the NHS has to look after them. So NHS and pension spending is going up and up. 

7: House prices are extremely high, this means people are saving money rather than spending it on things like buying and furnishing their first home, because they simply can't afford to.

8: We've seen a drop in the standard of living - that means people have less spending power than they used to so they can't buy as many things. The economy is driven by things being made and sold and used, and if people aren't buying things, the economy stagnates and businesses close.

**What the government is currently doing is:**

1: Making cheap debt available to the banks. They can borrow lots of money from the Bank of England at a low rate. The BoE just makes this money up and then destroys it when it's paid back. This is Quantitative Easing. This is actually a good idea and has been working, but not as well as intended, because some of the money the banks are borrowing is just going into their savings that they're now legally forced to hold (2 above).

2: Blaming people who are not or cannot work for being poor and useless and increasing the welfare bill. And lowering their benefits to punish them and trying to route out ""scroungers"" who are claiming benefits they're not entitled to. This is actually a dirty trick - the welfare bill is high due to pensions (aging population, above) and even if you eliminated all other forms of benefits tomorrow you'd not make much of a dent in the massive deficit. 

3: Increasing taxes on the middle classes. Which of course lowers their spending power...

4: Lowering the taxes on rich people. Funnily enough most of the government seem to be rich people. I wonder if these facts could be linked?

5: Beating the NHS with a big stick for being expensive and making mistakes.

6: Trying to avoid further European regulation of our banks as they're one of our more profitable industries. 

7: Taking every opportunity to blame Labour for a global financial meltdown.

And that's about it AFAIK.

*TL;DR: We were making lots of money now we aren't. Now the government is borrowing money just to keep itself ticking over. The people in charge are punishing the poor for the mistakes of the rich, and pointedly not doing much about some of the bigger issues (like raising the retirement age, for example), because it'd hurt their share of the vote.

That's what I like about her when I like her. And I wouldn't really say she was needy in a bad or unrealistic way, until *Journey's End* when I really wished she could have proved how awesome she had the potential to be in series 1 and moved on from the Doctor. I guess the problem for me is that Rose doesn't need the Doctor, she's just too afraid or something to realize that she doesn't. 

My problem with *Journey's End* really boils down to the way Tennant played it. He was making something disturbingly close to his solemn ""I am going to self righteously destroy evil aliens"" face. Because of that, it felt like he was punishing himself/his extra self by leaving him with Rose. Again the whole exchange was articulated in terms of need rather than want, which causes me distress. And, even if he really does love Rose, no one will ever convince me that he loves Rose more than he loves travelling in the TARDIS.

I really liked that moment in *School Reunion* where Rose confronts him. But in hindsight that also feels incredibly dishonest. I don't remember what exactly it was that he said, but he could not have actually meant that he wouldn't leave her. I wouldn't say it was an active intentional lie, but it clearly wasn't honest. He didn't take the time to think and be honest with Rose like Eleven does with Rory's Dad. There is a good chance something bad will happen and that he is unwilling to entertain the notion seems incredibly unhealthy to me. 

(I don't really want to get into my thoughts on Martha (I'm supposed to be working, and I can tell this is starting to get really incoherent) but Martha has a relationship with the Doctor as a friend and fellow kind of medical professional and then on top of that also has a hopeless, unrequited crush on him.

This is the more important role of a pivot, not to shut down one player, but rather limit the opportunities for combination play of the opponents. Not to say that he couldn't learn how to do this, and it's naturally pretty understandable that he doesn't have the positioning down yet since it comes with practice and he's played a more advanced role most of his career. I think he could eventually make that transition, but the defensive tasks of a pivot midfielder includes more than what his skill set currently brings. Yes he may have been able to play effectively against City, but City's midfield largely makes the transition through 1 player, and that's Toure.

He swore to destroy the universe. By hijacking and blowing up the TARDIS, he did it. Reboot notwithstanding. He swore revenge against the Time Lords, particularly the Doctor, and stole the Doctor's biodata during his fifth incarnation. And using the Silence and the Clerics as his agents within this universe, he finally ""killed"" the Doctor in a point of fixed time. His vendettas are now settled, the Time Lords are all gone as far as he knows. Time for the next stage of his plan.

So I am hoping to see Omega in the 50th anniversary special, and played by Peter Davison.

true,TopdeBotton,null,null,"It's pretty basic Keynesian economics; it's called a negative multiplier effect. 

- **Initial cut**: If you cut £10m worth of income, that cuts overall spending in the UK (by a certain amount depending on how much of that £10m would have been spent). 

- **First round of lost consumption**: Let's take the Bank of England's figure of [43% of income that gets spent.](http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/quarterlybulletin/qb120403.pdf) In this case, it's now £10m + £4.3m that *hasn't* been spent. 

- **Second round**: Another 43% of that £4.3m is not spent (£1.85m). Now there is a total of £10m + £4.3m + £1.85m that has not been spent. 

This process continues until the last pound that would have been re-circulated through the UK economy has been accounted for. 

This is a simplified explanation; the calculations can get very long and complex and the proportion of income per pound that is consumed (0.43) is from 2012. 

It's also important to note that part of every pound gets saved. I've not been able to find a figure but I estimate this to be about 20% or more of every pound. Part of that saving would then be invested by businesses. Which means several million of that £10m would have been invested but has not been.

As far as Schurrle himself, he adds something to our front line that we don't get out of the smaller players like Mata, Hazard, Oscar, in that he is probably faster and certainly more physical that all three of them.

I know the Silence and guns and stuff was to make it feel more American from an outside-the-story perspective, but to judge the characters I think it makes sense to look at them from an in-story perspective. If you don't suspend your disbelief the whole thing just unravels.

I didn't mean to say it was Amy's fault that the Silence were killed off, just that she never offered any resistance to it, and the companions that have been my favourite are the ones that tried to discourage the Doctor's violent episodes and push for negotiation, relocation and compassion.

Of course Donna and Rose had points where they went for the less honourable option when there were still others available - like when Donna drowned the Vespiform or Rose, as you say, with the Daleks (though I always tend to get the impression that she wasn't in a straight-thinking frame of mind at that point: the fact that she doesn't remember anything afterwards and brings Jack back almost - it seems to me - without thinking about it, just from an urge to give life, feels like it suggests she's running more on instinct than thinking things through and considering their ethics), but I'd be pretty confident in saying that overall they're compassionate, life-valuing and pacifism-striving characters and that appeals to me. There's many more instances where Rose tries to offer help to 'monsters' like the werewolf or condemns unnecessary violence like in *The Christmas Invasion*, and where Donna urges for peace and reconciliation like in *The Doctor's Daughter* or resists an action that will have a high loss of life - like leaving Pompeii behind without a warning. Amy on the other hand, strikes me as the opposite. She has moments where she's pushing for the peaceful option like in *A Town Called Mercy* but overall she tends to look for weapons as her first course of action and offers no resistance to the Doctor's less compassionate moments.

I've already mentioned my take on the matter of Rose's destruction of the Daleks, and to be fair to her I think it's a different situation from the Silence anyway. They and she knew that if the Daleks weren't stopped imminently there would be a terrible loss of life - including the Doctor's. Earth was already being bombed hard enough to reshape the continents. It had reached the point where desperate actions were more allowable, whereas with the Silence they hadn't really found out what they'd been doing before the Doctor genocided them. Yes they'd been there through Earth's history but there wasn't a great amount of evidence that they'd been particularly damaging or that anything imminently bad was going to happen to anyone other than Amy. They would have had time to grab Amy to safety then formulate another plan or attempt negotiation. I'm not quite sure what you mean by the queen lady who kidnapped Donna. If you mean the Empress of the Racnoss then Donna definitely did object to the Doctor's 'flood and fire' solution. That was what all the 'you need someone to stop you' stuff, the 'and it's terrible, that place was flooding and burning and they were dying and you stood there like... I don't know, a stranger' line and the horrified expression as it was happening were about, or if you mean the Pyrovile then I suppose she didn't offer much resistance on their behalf for erupting Versuvius but again they waited until they knew that the Pyroviles planned on invasion and human extinction before they took action, and they tried to negotiate/get to know the Pyrovile in the temple first.

**Oh god I'm sorry - as I warned, I do tend to rant about these things. I just came out of my 'Doctor Who debate' trance and noticed how long it's getting :/. I'll bold this and say don't worry about reading this if you don't want, but then again I'm going to continue because that's what I'm like -*shrug*-. Also no hard feelings - I don't know how I'm coming off here but I hope it's not too argumentative and bitchy :/.**

Though having said that I've now lost the thread of my thought and am probably going to have to peter out awkwardly... so yeah... this is me, petering out.... Basically I just prefer the more pacifist and compassionate companions, and whilst Amy does have many companion virtues like bravery and joie de vivre, the ones that are most important in creating my personal preferences for a character aren't there in as much an abundance as they are in Rose, Donna or for that matter Rory. Although you're right that Rose and Donna did have their less honourable moments (they're only human after all), I maintain that they are ultimately compassionate people that push for negotiation and reconciliation over violent solutions.",0,1366140281,null,0,false,0,c9ggt5z,t3_1cfazp,t1_c9ggt5z,t1_c9gbznp,null,1431535685,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

Making the character female poses a lot of risks. The biggest being that they are going to change the character to make it fit the sex-change. Last thing I want to see is to see a Doctor act completely different because suddenly he's female. It shouldn't really matter to the Doctor what sex he (it?) is, but it will matter to the audience.

Let me just say, I would never try and convince you that he love Rose more than traveling in the TARDIS because that's wrong. It bugged me too that it felt like he was punishing his half-self. It was like ""Bad Doctor. Go with Rose."" How is that to make Rose feel? I know that his thought process was that she saved him (Nine) from being destructive but in reality she just dulled the pain. She was like an anesthetic. Remember in the next episode The Runaway Bride he is ruthless and kills all those spider-creature babies. I think that was part Rose leaving- part him being severely emotionally drained/damaged due to being the last Time Lord.


Actually, I think that he was being honest with her. She knew that it was unsafe, she knew from the first time she stepped foot into the TARDIS that it was unsafe. I think that he meant he would want her to stay with him until she died or until she chose to leave. I honestly think that he expected something bad to happen. I mean they (enemies) had already used her as leverage against him before.  This is what was said:

ROSE: I thought you and me were. I obviously got it wrong. I've been to the year five billion, right, but this? Now this is really seeing the future. You just leave us behind. Is that what you're going to do to me?

DOCTOR:No. Not to you.

ROSE: But Sarah Jane? You were that close to her once, and now you never even mention her. Why not?

DOCTOR: I don't age. I regenerate. But humans decay. You wither and you die. Imagine watching that happen to someone who you

ROSE: What, Doctor?

DOCTOR: You can spend the rest of your life with me, but I can't spend the rest of mine with you. I have to live on. Alone. That's the curse of the Time Lords.

Barcelona was a unique situation. To compare this match to that is absurd.

Yes, everyone accused them of being unprofessional, and when Ferguson and Wenger throw tantrums they are also accused of being unprofessional.

No, but that doesn't mean he has no fondness for Chelsea at all. And it doesn't mean that all of his team mates are passionless shills. What evidence do you have to base this on? Because they walked down a tunnel looking disappointed and this disappointment was not sufficient enough for you?

Is this the same Drogba who has played for two clubs since he's left Chelsea? The same Mourinho who has managed Inter and Real Madrid since leaving? By your logic Chelsea is just another step on their journey.

true,GeneralRose,null,null,"For *Cold War*:  
Clara singing Hungry Like the Wolf had nothing to do with the resolution. As I saw it, it was just a her fear showing in the situation and the singing was due to the professor mentioning he liked to sing when he was scared earlier in the episode.  

The way I saw it was that when the other Ice Warriors picked up Skaldak, they had a conversation along the lines about how they hadn't abandoned him and how he was a hero. Then Skaldak remembered that he did attack and kill some humans before they had even shocked him.   

As for the Doctor not having an excellent plan? Sometimes there is no perfect plan to be had. The conclusion really stemmed from the Doctor being put into another lose-lose situation. He was physically outmatched and all he had left was to sacrifice himself, clara and the crew to save the whole of humanity from a nuclear holocaust. He begged, because there was nothing he could do at that point except to beg.  

For *Rings*:  
Seeing that Clara actually had parents (outside of the prequel) informed most of the general audience that she was in-fact, actually, properly born. This actually deepens the mystery of who and what she is in my opinion. The resolution was fairly predictable, but also raised some questions about the Doctor. Why was he so unwilling to give up Amy's glasses? Surely the same reasoning behind the leaf being an infinity of wasted days would apply to the glasses. The episode made me question the Doctor's selfish nature even as he acted selflessly.  

**TL:DR**: Clara's singing had nothing to do with the resolution in Cold War. In the Cold War resolution, the Doctor's only options were to beg or self sacrifice for the good of the many. Rings showed that clara was born and made me question the Doctor",0,1366142074,null,0,false,0,c9ghiub,t3_1ced8h,t1_c9ghiub,t1_c9gexmy,null,1431535349,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Granted, the radios would be good in the short term to find and coordinate anyone with any intellect.

About 1 road away are tracks for Haymarket train station which one would hope would provide a clear quiet route out of Edinburgh when everything had Calm-ish-ed down. The roof to the coop leads to a back garden for some apartment buildings, the wall is a high wall that encloses a carpark attached to the Coop.

If coordinated right a large portion of Zombies could be led into this carpark and then disposed of in a rinse and repeat fashion. Would require some petrol (Shell Station close by) to ignite a fire but again this is dependant on the panic buyer.

true,cech_mate,present,Didier Drogba is a Legend,"&gt;Barcelona was a unique situation. To compare this match to that is absurd.

How was Barcelona any different from this. the FA Cup is the oldest trophy  in the world way more older than the. Because fans doesn't value it anymore doesn't make it any less significant. when we won the Champions League we had a open top bus parade the same thing happen when every season when we win the FA Cup. winning the FA Cup is a huge accomplishment any allocade of that matter dont play it down like it was a friendly.

&gt;Yes, everyone accused them of being unprofessional, and when Ferguson and Wenger throw tantrums they are also accused of being unprofessional.

there is a difference unprofessional and passionate. Both manager react because they are passionate about the sport and their club they speak up when their club is unfairly treated. I guess that is unprofessional in your book of high standards. 

&gt;No, but that doesn't mean he has no fondness for Chelsea at all. And it doesn't mean that all of his team mates are passionless shills. What evidence do you have to base this on? Because they walked down a tunnel looking disappointed and this disappointment was not sufficient enough for you?

The evidence i have for Torres is blabbing his mouth after the most unforgettable night in our history by claimming he wanted to take a penalty but he wasnt chosen and that he had talk about his future with RA. and when he said during his spell on the bench he became the player who  if he didnt play and the team lose he really didn't care. Like i said before no one is accsuing them of being passionless act like you fucking care. Question the Ref why wasnt Aguero sent off or why wasnt the Torres and Mata penalty not given. Why was he so lenient toward City and allowed them to each fould 7 or 8 times before being booked. 

&gt;Is this the same Drogba who has played for two clubs since he's left Chelsea? The same Mourinho who has managed Inter and Real Madrid since leaving? By your logic Chelsea is just another step on their journey.

Drogba was let go. Mou wanted to control his players without board interference but werent given the go ahead. so he left on mutual agreement. both never left because they had better offers from different teams.

&gt;Your comment is incredibly ignorant, and you appear to lack a basic understanding of the sport. 

That the reason it called argument there is two side no one side is particularly right. So you calling my counter arguments ignorant make me think you are the ignorant one. Try to persuade e to change my opinion not label my counter argument ignorant. have a grand Ol Sepp Blatter or Mr football.

PS: Sifting through my entire argument and picking out once you can answer is not leading us any where this is not a Q&amp;A. it a argument don't highlight parts that you think you know and answer if you cannot respond to the entire argument let someone else try.

The media have painted her in a very positive light with remembrance shows, which would sway opinions. This would affect the outcome of the answers. I'd also like to point out that majority of the people they would have asked will have either not been alive during her reign or been too young to remember her policies.

Even with my views on this poll aside, I don't think anybody should base their opinions or views on one poll.

And majority did not love her. The poll shows that 28% see her as the best prime minister since 1945. It shows that 47% of people see her period as prime minister as good for Britain.

The are you detained or free to leave question is not as simple as it sounds. Its always fine to ask but sometimes you may not be detained but failure to prove details may result in arrest. Such as traffic offences, if you refuse details you can be arrested. Alot of the videos you see on this subject where the driver claims to be in the right because the police aren't doing anything are simply the police trying there best not to have to arrest someone for something so small as refusing details after a traffic offence. They just don't want you to have to go through that and will put alot of effort to get you to see sense.

""i don't consent to any searches"" simply answer to this is tough. You are detained under an act (section 1 of pace, section 23 of the misuse of drugs act etc.). Because you are detained if you refuse reasonable force can be used to make you comply. I suggest if you don'twant to be caught with drugs on you don't carry them.

Be polite and respectful, if you feel the need to not speak to them just give them your name, date of birth and current address. Let them write out there ticket/carry out there search and contact a solicitor or follow the complaints process afterwards if you believe there was wrong doing.

EDIT: if you want to know all the ins and outs of how the police should treat you i suggest reading PACE. Which is the police and criminal evidence act, it covers the codes and procedures the police must use.

the universe existed far before the explosion, and after it. The explosion didn't occur at the very base of time, instead it occurred much farther in the time line. 

The trick behind fixing the universe is that the pandorica contained molecules from the creation of the universe, and since the molecules eventually created everything else, that can be used to recreate anything.

""DOCTOR:
The perfect prison. Inside it, perfectly preserved, a few billion atoms of the universe as it was. In theory, you could extrapolate the whole universe from a single one of them, like cloning a body from a single cell. And we've got the bumper family pack.""

What happens is the light recreates anything that it touches as it should have been. So if something is dieing, it can recreate it according to how it should be. As such, the universe is dying, and so if the light touches it, it can recreate the dying universe according to how it should be. Since the tardis's explosion touches every single point in time and space at the same time, the light would do the same thing.

The trick is that by putting the tardis at the center of the explosion, the only way to heal the universe is to make it so the tardis never explodes in the first place (Otherwise it would just create an infinite loop of existing and not existing).

Of course it's never easy, and it's upsetting, but it was almost like a relief because we knew she was at peace. Compare that to someone dying unexpectedly, and feeling like they had so much more life left to live, I think there is a difference. 

I'm not saying one death is more important than the other, just that I think one may be easier to reframe (dependent on personal circumstances, of course).

I wish euthanasia was legal. My gran suffered so much in her final few days which is precisely the opposite of what she wanted. She had a living will telling doctors not to treat her, but I think they were so scared of litigation because of a lot of media coverage about treatment of dying patients that their hands were tied.

Yes, I know exactly what you mean. Sadly the best they could do for him in the States was to write a 'do not resuscitate' order, which meant that when she finally passed away (he cared for her at her home for two months), he did not have to call 911 to prolong the pain. In between though, jesus... where do I even begin to describe what he went through and witnessed? I guess in the forefront of my mind is the thing that shocked me the most though. Still upsets me to think about it. (paraphrase) 'She has completely gone now. Her eyes are totally glazed over, she cannot speak, she doesn't seem to be able to hear anyone... she keeps trying to go downstairs... I had to fight her for two hours to keep her in the room while gran slept... she kept hitting out at me and pulling things off the wall and smashing them... and she now walks around with her arms stretched out in front of her with that glazed look like a real zombie. All that's missing is her repeating 'brains.' I guess I know where Hollywood got zombies from now. I used to watch a lot of zombie movies but I don't think I'll ever be able to again.'

So walking off the field like nothing happen was a low blow to the fan. Oh we just got cheated. Well dust yourself up and move on. Stand up for what you believe in. Ask the ref why were we being single out. 

Back to my argument: They acted like they didn't care yesterday. Look at when Luiz got jump on by Assguero and the ref didn't blow nobody even ran up to ask why or demand Assguero be booked they all just went on. United and City game last week had more passion than our potential FA Cup repeat match. or when Torres was assaulted by Kompany nobody again give a shit Ba and Torres just raised their hand and moved on. Show a little bit of passion for the club. In this sub people talk about when Lamps and Terry retire who will be our new leader. Judging from that and 5 potential final we lost we don't have a leader. There was nobody to ask why was Luiz being used as a trampoline or why wasn't Torres awarded a penalty everyone just show lack of interest in the tournament. and moved on as soon as it was over.

Luke Shaw- If we are going in for a talented, LB of the future, I see few better options than this lad, plus, our history with the club.

Aubameyang - Future star, I have very little doubt. Second to the one and only Zlatan Ibrahemovic for goals this season, that says a lot.

Dzeko - only if Ade leaves and City aren't keen on holding on to their "" Impact sub"" he'd make a really efficient target man.

Secondly, what type of cancer and at what stage?

Thirdly, don't be afraid of bitching about cancer to me. I've learned a hard lesson about how people avoid it due to my friend's mum's death recently and I do not shy away from illness anymore due to not knowing what to say (which is why most people do). I did that when my friend died at the age of 30 years ago and I am never doing it again.

Of course alcohol's not going to help you daft twit, you're depressed enough and it's a sodding depressant. Stay off the gin! Talking to people about what you're going through is your least expensive alternative for now. 

My sister isn't worth talking to either. I haven't spoken to her for 11 months. I just don't like her. I kept up a facade for the last seven years after my parents moved away, but really, why should I pretend to when all we've done is fight our entire lives? Does it ever get any better? Do we think more similarly now that we are older? No. Go away. Would not want you as a friend, if you were a work colleague I wouldn't think for a second about socialising with you, so I'm not going to force myself to pretend we are friends anymore. 

Parents: it happens. They didn't chose the timing of their divorce announcement to coincidence with your cancer diagnosis. But sometimes other people's worries bring your own worries to the front of your mind. You can worry even more and not sleep or it can jolt you into dealing with reality, and doing it NOW, before it's too late.

So, anything else on your list? Feel free to add.

You're right, the multiplier effect applies to all spending, because one person's spending is another person's income and so on and so forth. 

The salient factors that would determine which £10m produced the biggest multiplier (biggest subsequent increase in UK spending) are the proportions consumed and saved. 

This however, is notoriously difficult to pin down because of the nature of money: some spending is by cash, some by credit card, some not registered officially at all. 

Why I argue it's a separate point is because the £10m was already put aside for the arts. We didn't start off with a spare £10m that people got a choice of two options to spend on. 

The government has been going on and on about how ""we're all in this together"" and yet significant amounts of money have been found for a lowering of the top rate of tax and a de facto state funeral for the most divisive PM in most people's lifetimes. 

People have a right to be angry. If this was a few years into the future and the UK was growing, £10m here or there wouldn't be a big deal.

National debts of a very few countries -- namely the UK, US, Japan, Switzerland, and mate a couple others -- are this way, and are therefore analogous to neither household debts nor the national debts of countries like Greece, which doesn't have sovereign control of its currency, or smaller states that lack the economic heft to maintain its strength.

Although still ambiguous, the most comfortable I am with saying is that it falls in to an 'advanced' stage. I'm sorry to not be more specific but it's just difficult.

I'm sorry to bring up your friends mum, my mum also suffered with it, I know, how hard that can be and I'm sorry if I bought up any hard memories. That stiff upper lip deal can be a bitch at the best of times.

I'm a scotch an ale man, I'm not quite OAP enough to be knocking back the gin just yet. And given that it is my only vice, you'll forgive me if I test it just a touch more, won't you? 



As for the sister-parents issue, my parents were always neglectful to say the least and my sister and I fought like no-ones fucking business, but I always took solace in the fact that when we grew up we'd always have each other. I guess you know what I mean? But, here I am drunk, alone and my family  falling apart before my very eyes. It's all a bit miserable.

There is a bit more but it all seems so fucking asinine now. I also, should add that in real life i'm not this melodramatic, nor will I ever be. I'm aware I could have died of malaria at the age of 2 in Africa and I have no right to be annoyed. This Is just the internet, and i really wanted to vent my frustration. I'm sorry to you or anyone else who reads this and thinks of me as a whiny, ungrateful idiot.

true,TheMania,null,null,"&gt;  The deficit is there, it's real, we're losing money each year. It is around £90 billion. A year. We spend £90 billion a year more than we take in.

Deficits don't drain money, they add wealth to the non-public in the form of bonds.

They're also required for the accounting to even work out.

Think of the monetary flows. Today, the foreign sector is saving in GBP via a trade deficit. They're storing wealth in GBP, taking from the UK. This is a drain on (private + public) savings.

Today households and businesses are deleveraging at a rate of knots on the back of the largest financial crisis the world has seen in decades. This is households saving GBP, taking from the (foreign + public) sectors.

Add the two together, and simply as a matter of accounting the public sector must be running a deficit. If it were not, either the private or foreign sectors must be failing to meet their desire to save. What happens when people can't save as much as they like? Paradox of thrift - widespread unemployment. That's what we see today, the government attempting to force down the public sector deficit, leading to households unable to save, leading to insufficient spending for high employment.

And for what? It's not like bond markets can move against the issuer of a free-floating currency. They never have, you're worrying about a hypothetical that doesn't even make any sense with no historical examples of it ever happening. You/Cameron are keeping millions unemployed all on a hunch that one day the market may do something nonsensical that it's never done before. Absurd.

As an aside, this isn't usually a problem in boom times as the BoE varies interest rates to ensure that there's always a sufficient amount of borrowing/spending occurring. Today, rates are as low as they can go but the BoE still can't incite sufficient lending/spending for full employment. So households are trying to save, the foreign sector is still trying to save - but you/Cameron are preventing the one sector that can supply these two sectors with the savings they desire, the public sector, from doing so. Why? And what is your solution? How are you going to get either the foreign sector or private sector to give up their desire to save, be content with what they have, and go on to spend for full employment?",0,1366154279,null,0,false,0,c9gm8ec,t3_1cgf1j,t1_c9gm8ec,t1_c9g8evo,null,1431533058,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

In some timelines the Doctor loves River, in other (that includes our timeline) the marriage is symbolic. This is best seen in the first episode with River:

Silence in the Library is the only episode with 10th and River. This River is the oldest one. She remembers ALL the encounters with the Doctor, yet, this River had 10th's screwdriver and she had no knowledge of the 11th. Ergo, this was a different River from a different time line.

The Doctor probably realizes that first River was from a different timeline, but since other are behaving the same way he just assume that in this timeline things are the same way so he is playing along. Yes, he is playing along. He knows that the ONLY reason why River knows his real name is because they got married at some point (by the way, notice that in our timeline he never told her his name). So he is acting, playing his part, he wants to know her side of the story, and River is teasing him.

So, finally, without the Doctor noticing it, they entered a timeline where their marriage is symbolical. But because he does not know that, he is playing along as usual, teasing River who eventually falls in love with him after Let's Kill Hitler.

Basically this is how I see it. The Doctor does not love her, he is intrigued by her. He thinks that one day for some reason he will marry her, so his playing along hoping to get some answers.

1) Speak to your uni; ask if it's possible to cancel your current studying and start again the next time it's made available (in six months, a year).

2) Some universities may allow you to do this at the early stages AND get a refund on whatever you have paid/a financial credit transfer - I have done this with the OU (but for a degree, not a masters).

3) This is the important bit: ask them about transitional fee arrangements. If they allow you to cancel your current studying and take it up later, you need to be certain that you're paying your current cost rather than the new cost (I don't need to tell you this, but for information for other readers, the OU currently charge me £1200ish each module, and as long as I am registered for a module each study year and I complete my degree by 2016, this will not rise to the new, fucking baffling, government-enforced, 'universities choose their own prices,' £5,000 per module fee (basically, per year, and a part time OU degree takes six of them). So yeah, universities pick their own costs, to a maximum of 9k a year these days.

4) I genuinely think it's better to get a good quality degree than to just power through even if you're shit at it/can't be bothered/are too busy getting drunk. I know far too many 2:2 students who still struggle to find really good jobs ten years after ending uni. Yeah, they're working, but they're not working for the best places. Frankly I'd rather bail out of it, swallow losing the money if I had to, and re-start it with the intent of giving it my ALL than to come away with a 2:2. I don't know what the grading is on Masters, but you get my point. 

5) Gonna question your interest in (and more importantly, your passion for) your chosen subject; someone who gets to a masters isn't stupid, but do you feel passionately about it? If the answer is no, think about changing/diversifying your career.

To do that you have to have a number of world-class players on your team.

He's not for sale. It's not something we're interested in.""

I also really like seeing the Ayre/club come out with a stern stance of no sale for Luis. Beforehand the were throwing around the possibility of accepting a high offer.

In the year 2013 time travel does not (currently) exist and there is (currently) no race known as ""Timelords"" which when you think about it doesn't even make sense because what about lady timelords? There also never will be time travel because all races that invent it eventually kill each other before sharing it with the past.

true,Ghwyr,hampshire,Hampshire,"I have a chronic illness, one that has necessitated me having to call an Ambulance on several occasions over the years. On one such occasion a Private Ambulance was sent instead of an NHS one. I have no complaints about the crew who were wonderful and did their best but they just were not equipped to handle my condition. They had no pain relief beyond gas and air and minimal monitoring equipment and no meds. Worst of all the Ambulance itself though clean and new was not as well built, the stretcher narrow and uncomfortable and the ride was rough and it swayed a lot around corners which when you have an acute bowel obstruction, intense painful abdominal spasms and an upper GI bleed and a 20 min ride to the hospital are all important. I did not feel secure at all during that ride, it was by far the worst Ambulance ride I have ever endured (at least whilst concious).

If I'm honest at least a part of that problem was that I did not have the faith and trust in the private crew that I do in the regular Ambulance Service, the stress and the anxiety made things worse. Seeing the regular uniforms and Ambulances of the normal service are a relief and a reassurance at a time when I'm at my weakest and most vulnerable. 

I understand the need for filtering calls and ensuring resources are sent were they are most needed and can understand when outside agencies and private companies can assist with that when the regular service is stretched, but I'd rather the money went to improving resources and capacity in the regular service than to outside agencies. I'd rather have a single service that I know can handle an emergency than two or more services running  parallel and not knowing which is going to turn up and whether or not they will be suitable or capable of dealing with the situation as it arises.

Compared to the Doctor, or anything else in the universe, humans are still children. With that in mind, the Doctor does sort of rummage through his pockets before looking at Clara.

As an ambulance crew myself, I love to hear peoples opinions on us.

Do you mind explaining your condition to me? (private mail if you don't want it on here) :)

If I may explain the problems you've discussed, in my opinion.

The NHS ambulances are stretched so thin due to cut backs and lack of support from people like GP's who advise patients to call 999 rather than the GP having to make a home call (again, not all GP's but they do loss interest after a few years) which means they need to pay outside agencies to help with the calls.

Depending on the area you live in, depends on the agencies you use, so  I cant comment on a lot of the agencies. 

with the pain relief, due to the laws regarding pain relief, only paramedics can give pain relief more than entonox (gas and air). Commonly morphine will be given by paramedics. You will get this problem with the NHS if they send a double tech crew, or a double ECA crew, which are becoming more common. 

If I was attending in your situation, I'd access your need for pain relief, and your condition, if you were in urgent need of pain relief or higher treatment, I'd call a paramedic immediately. If they are too far away, or if you didnt show the need for a paramedic, I would ask you if you were happy to travel on entonox or if you want more relief (I don't want to deny you pain relief, I don't have the right too)

With the vehicles, again its all to do with which agency, I've seen ambulances that are falling apart and aren't fit for use, but I've seen ambulances are brand new and well looked after. 

Within the company I work for, we have vehicles ranging from T reg's to 13 plates. although we don't use anything older than 52 plates, unless we have emergency transfers or a vehicle has broken.. but these vehicles have been well looked after and are under constant monitoring to ensure they are fit for purpose.

I can understand the stress and trust, you may not be able to tell skill levels as they are set out within the NHS. Again if it was me, I'd hope to be able to talk to you properly, explain what I'm doing and ensure you that I am competent and you are in good hands.

We provide 3 ambulances for the NHS a day, including weekends and bank holidays. 

I can see your points and its good to see others opinions on the situation we have.

Our companies ambulances are fully equipped, although we cant do cardiac monitoring (that's the NHS telling us we cant, not we don't provide it). We are ready to deal with what ever you throw at us!

And as far as a female Doctor, I would be fine with it. Took him long enough to be a chick. But then again, think about how much that would affect the Doctor. Imagine being a part of an involuntary sex change. Going from a 1000 years of being male, to suddenly being a woman. I'd like to see how the Doctor would handle it. Would his mentality change? Would his sexual preferences change? How would his companions react. Would the Doctor continue to have companions mainly of the female variety, or will we be seeing more men in the TARDIS?

If they do decide to make the next Doctor female, I would be interested in seeing the direction both the actress and the directors and writers take it. The shows dynamic would definitely change for sure, and hopefully they would be able to keep it true to the show as well as keeping their fans, both old an new, in love with the show.

Anyways, they pretty quickly exposed themselves as cheating cunts and ran the team into the ground and then got relegated. And I realized that there is not a more asshole-filled fanbase outside Newcastle.

And so I was once again a soccer orphan, with no team to support. I toyed with doubling down on the ""counter-culture"" thing and supporting Leeds, but they're like a more boring &amp; cuntish West Ham, so that ended quickly.
About this time, my brother had started supporting Spurs, and had been imploring me to watch some matches with him. So I did. And though I wouldn't admit it then, it was love at first sight. We DID play attacking football, not just talk about it. And the fans were super loyal but not cunts! And to be honest, I still get enjoyment out of beating my Arsenal; in some ways doubly so, because I know what cunts they really are. The camaraderie here, the sense of being a football club that's just as much about ""football"" as about ""club"" (if that makes sense) has drawn me in, and made me sure I'm exactly where I belong.

You have the planet orbiting a black hole, Possession of one of the characters, freaky Ood behavior and a very well done Ood chase. And then is goes on to add more elements such as the earth quakes and the TARDIS being lost for the WHOLE two episodes. AND THEN you have the whole entire ancient civilization thing with the ruins down where they had drilled. The language the TARDIS couldn't translate and the Devil. To be honest I think more material was written into those two episodes than in an entire series of Moffat Who. I would have loved for all of those things to have been explored further as everything mentioned in that episode is captivating. Down to the dialogue Ten and Rose end up having about what they would do if they had to go and live without the TARDIS and be normal human beings.

I've always believed that The Doctor ""Married"" her just to save time, before that moment The Doctor really didn't show any interest in her. She has always forced her way into storys, notice she is never invited by The Doctor to come along. You might say this is because he views her as an equal and River is very independent. But honestly if The Doctor wants someones company he offers them to come travel with him. Now I know there are a lot of things we still don't know about there relationship. Hell for all we know, River could be at a completely different time in the relationship compared to what we have seen. But based on information shown in the show, I do not believe The Doctor loves River. It may be important to mention that I'm being a little harsh as I've never liked River, I don't know what it is, but her character always annoys me. Her little quirks and catch phrases are annoying rather than endearing to me. Onto the Rose and Doctor dynamic compared to the Eleven and River dynamic... They really don't compare. Also we have to take in account that RTD wrote for Ten and Rose and Moffat is writing Rivers and Elevens. And their writing styles are so so so very different. Ten was written to be more compassionate and the most human. Nine was still burdened heavily with the effects of the time war and he repressed and brooded a lot. Rose helped change nine and when he died and regenerated Ten was definitely ""Rose's Doctor"", as what he regenerated into was molded to the way Rose had changed him. This made if very easy for The Doctor, who was now showing his emotions much more openly, to fall in love with Rose. I'm blatantly being a huge Rose+Ten fan here, but to be honest they where written as a love story and I loved every minute of it. River and Elevens dynamic doesn't come close to what Ten and Rose had. And I don't believe that The Doctor (at least at this time) is in love with River.

true,Ghwyr,hampshire,Hampshire,"Luke, my primary condition is Crohn's Disease which was diagnosed about 20 years ago and I've had several operation's to remove affected sections of my bowel. Due to the inflammation it causes and the scar tissue it can cause an obstruction in the bowel (like a blocked drain) which then causes intensely painful spasms and D&amp;V. The Crohn's can also sometimes cause ulceration and fistula's which can open up and bleed and embarrassingly I suffer from syncope and fitting on occasion due the bleeding and pain. 

I know from experience that when I suffer an obstruction if I take my painkillers (I have zomorph at home) and anti-spasmodics and stay as still and as motionless as possible and just try to endure the pain then 9 times out of 10 it will mostly pass in about 10-14 hours and I'll be back on my feet in a few days. On those rare occasion when that doesn't work (about 2-3 times a year) I need an Ambulance. I try to avoid this as much as possible because an Ambulance means 10-14 days in hospital being nill-by-mouth and on a drip (although this is a good way to diet). Calling my GP is useless, they won't come out and will just refer me to an Ambulance (there's actually nothing the GP can physically do to help anyway). Occasionally I do go through the GP to arrange a non-emergency transport rather than calling 999 (even though that can mean a wait of 2-3 hours for an Ambulance). However as a rough rule of thumb if I get to the stage where I can't physically stop myself from screaming outloud in pain or can't remember my name then we go through 999 to get an Ambulance.

The inflammation and abdominal distension means I cannot physically bend to sit and the slightest bump or twist sends waves of pain and nausea throughout my body and causes dry heaving hence the need for an Ambulance to transport me. I know from bitter experience that entenox just isn't strong enough to touch the pain, it's got to be morphine.

In the past when I've had community responders or double tech crews come out to me (and on one occasion a paramedic who'd run out of morphine) they have always requested a paramedic come to administer pain relief to stabilise me before transport. The private crew that came did not, despite my sister and I asking they insisted that entenox would be enough. Not really the crews fault, it was a judgement call and they thought it better to get me to hospital quick rather than delay waiting for an available paramedic.

I think this is one of the difficulties faced by the current system, how do you account for and categorise cases and allocate resources? I can understand why when stretched they sent a private crew to me rather than a regular paramedic as on the surface my case is not a priority, it's not life-threatening, its not complicated, it sounds like a simple scoop and run. But on occasion a simple low priority call can get really complicated very quickly, it's easy to underestimate it and whereas a regular ambulance has to resources available to handle something a bit more severe than expected a private crew may not. That's not a criticism of the crew, I've never dealt with a crew that were anything less than stellar in the way they dealt with me, but from a personal perspective I know I will need strong pain relief and a comfortable and secure transport when I'm ill, something I know I get from the regular service but for various reasons beyond the control of the crew I may not get from a private company.

Also, Green! This may sound like the stupidest thing in the world, but a few years ago I had a serious upper GI bleed and bowel obstruction and blacked out at the top of the stairs and fell down hard. I broke my nose, my orbit, knocked out three teeth, cracked a couple of ribs and woke up in intense pain and covered in blood and other less pleasant stuff. I could not see straight, I couldn't make out shapes, I could hear words but just couldn't understand them. I couldn't breathe properly my chest was on fire I could feel my heart thumping and straining and I thought I was going to die (I wasn't, but it damn well felt like it)... and then I recognised the green from the paramedics uniform and it was the most wonderful thing ever because that green meant I was safe. Even though I could not see shapes or make out people or understand what was being said that colour was enough to reassure me. When your in that kind of situation, the pain and the panic and the confusion that kind of instant recognition and reassurance is so important and I don't think a private company will ever be as trusted or accepted as a regular crew until they have that same level of instant recognition.",0,1366167869,null,0,false,0,c9gr8bc,t3_1cgxxv,t1_c9gr8bc,t1_c9gnnxq,null,1431530702,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

There are an excess of candidates, and as you point out some of those already have experience and others do not. 

1. What is the benefit of providing experience when there is an excess of candidates?
2. Assuming a candidate gains useful experience through this scheme and then finds employment, what happens to another candidate?
3. As an employer, if you had the choice, would you prefer to a) pay someone to do a job, or b) not pay someone to do a job.
4. If you could not pay someone to do a job, what happens to the person who you were previously paying to do the same job?
5. Why is it right that the welfare budget is used to subsidise selected businesses?
6. ???
7. Profit

Edit: There are ample alternative solutions. The very simplest I can think of off the top of my head is that the majority of all employment is provided by small businesses, not large businesses.

You should really just check out what's on sale at that art walk, get an idea of comparable prices for the same sizes/paper quality, and then go from there, remembering that you can add a little bit of a premium because it is fan memorabilia. Otherwise, general rule of thumb for the base price would be cost of materials (including printing/repro costs) divided by the number you expect to sell, times two. Adjust upwards from there based on whether it's an upmarket/upscale area, how different your work is from others on the art walk (or how different to, if you're British), etc.

I really like the analogy of the two ""playing house."" River called the two of them sociopaths, though this isn't true, but to some extent they are both emotionally stunted, so for River to show her obsession with the Doctor, that manifests as wanting to be married to him. And the Doctor, who just wants the people he loves to be happy and safe and with him, that leads to acting his part. That doesn't mean he dislikes their ""marriage,"" cuz he does have fun with it, and it doesn't mean that he doesn't like her, because I think he does... Just that he adopts this custom of marriage that maybe he thinks is unnecessary.

true,manosdelmuerto,river,River,"In response to the second part of your post. The leaf is more significant because it has a specific history. 

This is where we have to get a little abstract. 

As objects move through time they become parts of people memories and therefore have deep emotions attached to them. This is what the 'god' fed off of and what they used as currency. (I imagine most beings on that planet had some form of psychometry). 

When the leaf fell off the tree it became part of a set of events that led to two people meeting. This on it's own is nothing special, any object in the world could be responsible for the meeting of two people (a spilled coffee for example) The object is then forgotten, only referenced when the memory is thought of. 

What Clara's father did was special. He saved the leaf. In the way that there are 'fixed' point in time, there can be 'fixed' memories. Clara's father removed the leaf from the flow of time, meaning that it would forever symbolize a series of events. 

The Falling of the leaf into a wandering man
the stumbling of that man into the path of a car
the saving of a man by the woman
their courtship 
their marraige
Their first journey (that of being parents)
The jouney's that they would have with that daughter.

all of these were what the leaf represented. And to Clara specifically the leaf represented all of the journey's that she would never have because her of the death of her Mother. The Glasses would have memories, but The Doctor sees it as a journey with an end. He looks at the Ponds and thinks of all the adventures he had, but not necessarily all of the adventures he could have had. 

As an added note on the death of the monster. The 'Memory' of the leaf and the emotions attached to it did not need to be completely infinite, just substantial. The Doctor filled it with billions of memories, filled the creature to the brim until it could contain no more. Clara's leaf was the straw that broke the camels back.

true,cheese345,null,null,"From my personal point of view i find it insane. I was in the armed forces and spent alot of time with firearms and it would just make me uncomfortable knowing others had them or even i was carrying one on the street.  I can't understand the want or need to carry any firearm with you in a public place. The way i see it if i am going to get robbed they will more than likely pull a weapon before i knew what was going on, and if there was an active shooter type event and i pulled my weapon and shot at the guy i am just as likely to be mistaken for the bad guy and shot by another member of the public in the confusion. 

From my professional point of view I believe if we arm ourselves we only force criminals to arm themselves and escalate the violence. I would also be incredibly nervous approaching any man with a gun whether he seemed polite or not. It opens up a new dynamic to everyday police work. I can't tell you how many normal looking and acting people i have met or routine jobs i have attended that have turned in seconds. Add a gun to this and people would die. Also somethings i think we do very well would have to stop. For example policing a friday and saturday night in the town/apprehending violent criminals now we can pile 5-8 officers on one man and wrestle him to the ground. From the outside it looks very violent but in truth with that many officers its usually the safest way to stop someone and minimizes injury. If people routinely carried firearms or the police carried firearms (I'm sure one would follow the other) that stituation would then become a struggle for the gun. I also think it would create a barrier between the police and the public by putting both sides more on edge, and we police by consent so this is not a good thing. You can see it happening in america and this is why there is such a huge divide and distrust in the police there.

One of the oddest things i noticed about american gun law from reddits videos was a male (i don't know what state) was  carrying a firearm (a AR15 i believe) in open carry through the street and began to become annoyed at police and say they had no right to question him about it. I would of at least thought considering how dangerous open carry could become there would be some sort of stop search or encounter power that allows the checking of details of an individual to see if they were allowed a weapon. It seems unsafe not to have that to me.

All that said America is a totally different ball game. Gun culture is a huge part of society, to a point you'll never be able to take the guns away. But i do believe tighter restrictions are needed to control the sale of weapons, but not the ones the america government is implementing like trying to ban assault weapons. There definition of this seems to be more on about the aesthetics of the weapon rather than the weapons action. Mental health checks, mandatory weapon safety classes and limiting the number and sale of ammunition allowed to be stored at home all seem like good ideas to me.

true,Mik0ri,mcgann,McGann,"The regeneration limit was never elaborated on beyond being just that - a limit. Something you can ""use up""... that's about it.

For all we know, this limit was more law than biology and is no longer in effect since the passing of Gallifrey. But even from a purely biological standpoint, it's vague and it's been played with a lot. 

The Master is a prime example of just how much it can be played with - he used all his regenerations, and still managed to come back through multiple alternative means, multiple times, before the Time Lords purposely ""brought him back"" with regeneration energy to spare just because they wanted him as a warrior. And then there was the potion of life crap after that, if you want to go deep into the contrived and eye-roll-inducing. It was implied that if it weren't for the actions of Mrs. Saxon, it would have given him a perfect new body, memories and all, all from the ring.

Regeneration energy is also referenced multiple times - ""using it all up"" removed River's ability to regenerate, and reanimated a corpse of a man whose regeneration abilities had been disabled at the time of death. It can be released at will and can magic away wounds, which River called a ""waste"", implying that using enough lowers the amount of times you can regenerate.

And then there's the meta to consider - Doctor Who will never end. All who say otherwise will be shot.

TL;DR the regeneration limit is absurdly wibbly-wobbly, and almost certainly isn't still the amount originally specified.

One popular fanon is that River's regeneration transaction with The Doctor in Let's Kill Hitler was a simple matter of addition and subtraction, adding all the lives she hadn't used to his own ""counter"" on top of simply reviving him.",0,1366186252,null,0,false,0,c9gvzqc,t3_1cgxkj,t1_c9gvzqc,t1_c9ggx1h,null,1431528388,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

What a retarded comment.

&gt;Anyway, as to Thatcher:

Well, 9 out of 14 isn't bad.  However :

&gt;Rampant Sexism

Thatcher certainly exhibited an aversion to women, had next to no female cabinet members, and seemed to actively dislike traditionally female attributes in general. There was nothing female about Thatcher herself and she surrounded herself with the sort of clubby,woman-hating tory grandees that she herself wished to be. Thatcher did nothing for women and most of her policies harmed women considerably. 

&gt;Controlled Mass Media

One of the few things I might give credit to Thatcher's government for is the creation of Channel 4 - only because they had no idea what they were creating. 

Apart from that, you've clearly forgotten the control of the media for the duration of the Falklands War, the censorship of elected Northern Ireland politicians, the rise of Murdoch and Wapping.  

&gt;Religion and Government are Intertwined

True, there was no real indication of this, but one wouldn't expect it in Britain as much as in Catholic countries where Fascism has taken hold most readily. 

&gt;Rampant Cronyism and Corruption

How can you even dispute that this happened?  It was the *raison d'etre* of her premiership. 

&gt;Fraudulent Elections

True, no outright fraud, but her instincts were certainly anti-democaratic and she showed enthusiastic support support for totalitarian regimes abroad.

If your words will cause offense to other people then it can be against the law.

Trouble is that everyone has a different list of words they personally find offensive.

Interestingly some courts have ruled recently that swearing at the police, if only the police are present, is not covered under Section 5.

true,ActionPriest,null,null,"&gt;Legislation wont change attitudes - it just criminalises them.

But surely the point is not to change attitudes, its to change behaviour?

As a gay person I don't care whether or not my boss like me, or thinks I am disgusting. 

I DO care that he can't fire me because of how he feels. Thanks to the equality act he now cannot do that. His opinions do not matter in the slightest to me. I equally don't care about the opinions of my landlord, or someone selling me a room for the night. What I want is not having to end up sleeping in the streets.

There seems to be a belief that campaigners are against discrimination are against people having opinions. This is really not the issue at all. I expect people to hold bigoted feelings against me for being gay, I expect people not to like me for it. I just want the law to stop them from causing me untoward harm, and me being significantly materially worse off, or endangered as a result of being part of a minority against which bigoted attitudes are common. 

As a result of these laws not only am I massively safer, but I can feel safe. I don't have to go into work knowing one bigoted superior can arbitrarily end my career, or that I will get kicked out of shops for holding hands with my boyfriend. Thats all I really care about. They can think whatever they want.

The thing you cannot fix are strong bigoted attitudes, save, generally, with the death of people who hold them. You can however stop them acting on those behaviors in ways that affect the important part of peoples lives.

I also think the idea that deeply rooted cultural biases are something that can be quickly ""educated"" out is far more patronizing than enforcement legislation.

Who could be on a stage, crowing about their victory and ridiculing those less fortunate than them without any sense of irony, shame or self-knowledge? That’s not a stand-up comedian.

Actually, this is not 100% true. [Look here](https://www.gov.uk/find-out-if-i-can-buy-or-carry-a-knife), it states that you do not need to give a reason for carrying a knife if it has a non-locking blade under 3 inches. Although it does say not using it in a threatening way, which I suppose self-defense would be. 

So as I understand it, having a non-locking, under 3inches knife doesn't require you to justify carrying it. But I would imagine that an officer would still not be happy with you carrying one, especially if you are a youth and/or in a city.

Well this uni project I have to do is being a pain in the ass! I have little-no motivation to do it, partly because I've been doing it since october, partly because of other shit going on (see below) and also that whilst it's not too difficult it's just tedious at this point. It's a 13000 word limit (daunting!) and I've done 3000.... my friend (who is doing a very similar) project and I are unsure how we're actually going to reach that limit due to the nature of our projects. I hate doing bad work though and can put too much stress on myself to do well so that's probably part of the reason (this is quite therapeutic and eye opening to make myself type this out!) as I guess I'm scared of writing it and doing badly? Which is silly logic as if I don't write it I will do worse! The projects worth a huge amount to my degree (don't want to work it out right now but it will have a significant impact on my degree I believe...actually I might work it out). 

My parents announced in the summer that they were splitting up...although they're remaining friends. So we're trying to sell the house which is a bit upsetting since this is the family home and when we move out my parents will be living separately and we won't be a family anymore :(

I'm also trying to apply for jobs, which is a pain trying to find the time to do it as I need to prioritise the project.

I do a martial art (with katana, hence the name!) when I'm at home and that's going badly at the moment as I've been at uni so haven't been training. I've been doing it for years so should be much much better than I am at the moment. So pissed I've regressed so much! I have just changed to a heavier sword with a different balance on it though and haven't had chance to get used to it yet. I don't want to disappoint my teacher though, although he probably understands. It's frustrating seeing people who started at the same time as me become much better!

On top of all this my boyfriend dumped me last week completely out of the blue. It was (international) long distance but I thought we were doing well! I did rant about this elsewhere on reddit if you want the full thing although I'm currently okayish about it as I need to prioritise my project so I'm trying not to think about it. Got a night out of getting drunk (and hopefully pulling to boost my confidence again!) planned for the 26th.

true,ActionPriest,null,null,"&gt;If your boss is as big as a bigot as he seems he will look into other reasons to sack you. So making it illegal to sack you for your sexual orientation fixes one scenario but still leaves you vulnerable.

He may wish too, but we have a system of tribunals in this country that is burdensome enough on the employer that makes it very hard for him to do that. We also have a media that will report far more readily when the law is broken. He has to be both have a reason, and be effective at subterfuge. In the example you provide if you had any evidence to suggest he might have been motivated my prejudice then punishing you for your browsing history in that manner *would* be found by a tribunal as targeted, unless he was doing it to everyone. 

In the case of discrimination he has to avoid creating any evidence that the actions are motivated by bigotry, or that such bigotry even exists, or he is making his life far more difficult. There is also a massive chilling effect in the workplace. He can't communicate his opinions of this nature professionally to others if he wishes to act on them, nor they to him. This has the effect of short circuiting office cultures that make people feel discrimination is unnacceptable.

Being able to be open about discrimination makes it much, much, easier to engage in, and makes it worse as bigots can congregate and bond openly around the topic, creating a workplace culture where it is normalised. Bigotry, in short, is kept out of the office, and into their personal life where it belongs.

What we are talking about here is lower caste people being openly and consistently abused at work. Overtly denied better work across the board. Employers asking questions about caste status. These are all things inclusion in the Equality Act would stop.

&gt;Remove the man or his views and you can then finally be treated equally.

The thing is thats not going to happen, certainly not his views, nor a bigoted employer unless his actions are a liability to the company, and people like Jo Swinson who think it is are childishly naive.

Of course these laws do not eliminate discrimination, but they make it much harder to do so, and thats more than can be said for any other countermeasure.

He has to do it in violation of strongly written company policies, knowing he is subject to a potentially higher level of scrutiny, and in defiance of company education of material outlining anti discrimination policies. These all exist principally as a result of the liabilities created by this legislation.

Moreover it can't be spoken about in the office. This kills dead discriminatory workplace culture, wherein peoples views become normalised, magnifying the problem.

The media is lousy with cases of the Equality Act being used to enforce either companies or public bodies to change their behavour. A transgender girl was refused permission to sit her GCSEs, but had printed out a copy of the Equality Act so was allowed to sit them. Employers have been successfully sued for not doing enough to stop bigoted co-workers and superiors.

And these are cases where it had to be enforced with punitive consequences. There, as with all laws, are vastly more where it would have been stopped in advance.  Where employers, or businesses, or individuals would have acted but know they can't. Because of the Equality Act businesses now go out of their way to setup procedures and policies to ensure they are in compliance. In large organisations possible violations are rigorously investigated, and taken much, much more seriously as a result of legislation.

The argument that just because legislation doesn't stop a problem completely its it ""did nothing"" is hopelessly reductive. Thats like saying because we cannot stop theft, and people will always find ways to steal we shouldn't legislate on it.

&gt; ""Brick,"" by Ben Folds Five.

&gt; Written from the perspective of a man who takes his young girlfriend to an abortion clinic, this song describes the emotional scars of ""reproductive freedom"": ""Now she's feeling more alone / Than she ever has before. . . . As weeks went by / It showed that she was not fine.""

This song is overtly *not* political; it doesn't cast abortion in a food or bad light, its just his personal struggle. No-where in this song should you read ""don't get an abortion"" or ""It shouldn't be a woman's right to choose"". Only a right wing American could interpret this as anti-abortion. On a side note Its also one of Ben Folds Five's weakest songs.

&gt;""Stay Together for the Kids,"" by Blink 182.
&gt;A eulogy for family values by an alt—rock band whose members were raised in a generation without enough of them: ""So here's your holiday / Hope you enjoy it this time / You gave it all away. . . . It's not right.""

I'm pretty sure this song is about the *exact opposite* to what they're talking about: parents who live together in a loveless relationship ""for the kids"" despite hating each other:

&gt; Their anger hurts my ears, been running strong for seven years
&gt; Rather then fix the problems, they never solve them, it makes no sense at all
&gt; I see them everyday, we get along so why can't they?
&gt; If this is what he wants, and it's what she wants, then why is there so much pain?

The subtext to ""All the Small things"" is also pretty clear; Its clearly about the rise of socialist politics in South America.

And ""Who'll Stop the Rain,"" by Creedence Clearwater Revival.... What? How is this right wing?

It seems a lot of the things on that list are ""Conservative"" because they're against tyrant dictators. I don't think a lot of right wing people realise that, whilst they are ""anti-state"" the state in western countries is not the product of socialists, but, rather, capitalists who use it as a tool to consolidate power.

Are separate vaccines legal?: Yes. 

Although separate vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella are now unlicensed in Britain it is not illegal for doctors and clinics to import the vaccines as long as they inform the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) that they are bringing the vaccine into the country.

What is the cost?: Approx £45

Where are they available?: Only a handful of clinics and private doctors in London, Brighton, Sheffield, West Yorkshire, Edinburgh and Glasgow are openly administering the separate vaccines in the UK. But it is thought many more doctors may be offering their patients the jabs.

Basically there arent a huge number of doctors offering it because there is no point not giving the mmr. why on earth are there still worried parents after the paper claiming a link between mmr and autism was widely and wholly discredited and the man responsible banned from practicing medicine for the damage he had caused.

Because of racism, sure, but also a career that takes you to the level of PM lasts 40 years, 30 minimum.

&gt;What is the benefit of providing experience when there is an excess of candidates?

[Because of what happens when you don't](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Generation). The number of people out of work for a year or more is above 900,000. Studies have shown that once you're out of work for six months or more, employers will ignore you in favour of less experienced applicants. It becomes incredibly hard to find work.

Adding more jobs does nothing to fix the problem, once it exists. The people become less and less employable the longer they're out of work; lowering the bar to entry only keeps pace with that, and the EU system for migrant working means that there will always be a large enough pool of more employable cadiates to displace them.

&gt;Assuming a candidate gains useful experience through this scheme and then finds employment, what happens to another candidate?

If he's in the same situation, hopefully he'll have the same luck.

&gt;As an employer, if you had the choice, would you prefer to a) pay someone to do a job, or b) not pay someone to do a job.

As an employer, what would entice you to employ someone otherwise unemployable? Businesses arn't charities; they have no responsibility to solve societies problems.

&gt;If you could not pay someone to do a job, what happens to the person who you were previously paying to do the same job?

The aim of the scheme isn't to replace exisiting jobs, and the positions are only temporary.

&gt;Why is it right that the welfare budget is used to subsidise selected businesses?

How is it a subsidy? Each party; the employer, the jobseeker, and the government, is getting something from the arrangement.

&gt;The very simplest I can think of off the top of my head is that the majority of all employment is provided by small businesses, not large businesses. So give small businesses tax breaks for employing people.

true,potpan0,null,null,"I think the problem with Solbakken was that he didn't have any alternatives. He tried to play a fast game, but didn't take into account that half our players are shit, and can't play that way. 

At least Saunders has had the balls to fully drop a lot of the old guard, and get in some players on loan. At the start of the season we could have said that players like Foley and Ward aren't good enough. Solbakken didn't react to this, but Saunders has, bringing in Robinson on loan and playing Doherty, two players who I really rate. 

I think Saunders is a bit immature with his managing in some ways though. After we score a goal, he'll play really defensively, he changed the formation too many times at the start of his reign, and I really don't agree with swapping to 5 at the back at the end of a match, you're just asking for the opponent to put pressure on you and take pot shots, and as we've seen, we concede loads of pot shots.

So, if he keeps us up, I think he should get another go. I think he has it in him to get rid of the old guard and build around some of our younger players, as well as those Solbakken brought in. If we go down, however, he should go. He was brought in to get results. If he takes us down, he's done the opposite of that, so he should go.

Also, I think Solbakken showed us that we really need to step up our European scouting. Getting players from Ireland and Scotland just won't cut it anymore. Players like Sako and Sigurdarson were absolute steals, and if we can get more players like them from the bottom end of the French or Spanish leagues, then we definately should.

So really these people have just been reallocated from ""unemployed and not looking for work"" to ""unemployed and actively looking for work"". 45,000 of this is due to women who previously weren't looking for work due to raising children now choosing to actively look for work.

true,chromofoam,uk,Hertfordshire,"There is that aspect, but the cornerstone of a business is that division of labour = greater earnings. So for example, you start your own business selling plumbing parts - you can only administer the sales of so many parts in one day - there are only so many hours that you have a flow of customers and the time and energy to deal with it - when you get to capacity, you hire another person, and obviously you have to pay them.  Now hiring another person would never happen if hiring that person didnt increase your productivity - it in theory almost doubles your income potential, since you have another 'you' (again, in theory - doesnt always work in practice) selling plumbing parts. As things grow, the more people you employ, the more money you make. The same is true in reverse, unless you're a company that is so large you have enough capital income to be able to weather lean staffing periods - and if this is the case, in this climate you'll always have an army of people prepared to do the job if your staff decide to leave - in this instance you do get the 'squeeze' you mentioned, but anyone who knows their onions is going to be quite careful about this because they know that less staff means less income means more rolling up of sleeves for management.

When you divide up the number of registered companies in the UK alone, there are actually only something like 7% who have more than 10 employees, the rest are all sole traders, one or two man bands and small companies, so you've got alot of tiny companies all trying to keep afloat out there.

It does a huge range of things. Of course, some of it will seem less relevant to you than other things they do. This does not mean that 'most of what the seem to do is a waste of time and money'.

The Arts Council is effectively a cultural investment fund, and they create a greater return on their expenditure than many other funded organisations.

But it's very easy to pull one thing out you easily disagree with, extrapolate it to be representative of everything else they do, and then decide it proves the whole thing is a waste of time. This is the kind of straw-man argument that is the life blood of the ravenous tabloid press.

Edit: and, indeed, it was 2.61 million last February...

Edit 2: and another more positive fact from the ONS post:-

&gt; ""A key factor in the increase in unemployment is that the number of people actively engaging with the labour market is increasing. Between September to November 2012 and December 2012 to February 2013, the number of people aged from 16 to 64 who were not in the labour force (known as economically inactive) fell by 57,000 to reach 8.95 million. A large part of this decrease was for women who were economically inactive because they were looking after the family or home. The number of women in this category fell by 45,000 between September to November 2012 and December 2012 to February 2013 to reach 2.06 million, the lowest figure since comparable records began in 1993.""",0,1366201770,null,0,1366202805,0,c9gy4r6,t3_1ciu12,t1_c9gy4r6,t1_c9gwib1,null,1431527380,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

true,[deleted],null,null,"I think its important to recall the basis for the cuts being imposed and that is the financial crises caused by the banks and financial institutions, resulting in the looting of the national treasury i.e. tax payers money.

The politicians of the Labour, Conservative and Lib Dem Party, who are nothing but the political representatives of the banks and big business are incapable of providing a honest analysis and explanation of why they support savage cuts to public services, jobs and wages. This is because the cuts are being carried out to pay for the billions if not trillions of tax payers money that was handed over to the banks.

Despite claims that there is no money to fund public services and there is no option to cuts,the Bank of England has provided monthly ""leverage"" (bailout money) to the banks and financial institutions totaling £375 billion as of March2013, this is in addition to raiding of the national treasury in 2008. At the same time the stock markets are buoyant and banks are still paying out record bonuses to its top executives. All this despite continual claims from the representatives of the three main political parties and now the Greens that they have no choice but to implement devastating austerity measures and their empty promises of imposing controls on the reckless and criminal activities of the banks. 

The Greens initially tried to promote themselves as a party of no cuts. For example its candidate in Easton, Anna McMullen, asserts, “Greens across Bristol have a track record of standing up for what matters…We are activists who are willing to speak up to protect public services, oppose the cuts, and make sure local voices get heard"" and in its manifesto for the Bristol Mayoral elections the Green Party declared, “We do not agree with the logic of cutting public spending at a time of recession,” and pledged it would “fight for Bristol resources.” The Greens have proven that there promises to oppose cuts are not worth the paper they are written on.

This record of betrayal by the Greens can also be observed in Brighton where they control the council and also on a national level in Germany and Ireland where they were in the national governments that imposed savage attacks on the workers. This is because the Greens, just like the Labour, Tory and Lib Dems are defenders of the economic and political system that caused the economic crises...capitalism.

No solution can be found within the confines of capitalism. At the end of March, a report by the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee (FPC) revealed a capital shortfall in Britain’s main banks of £25 billion which it warned needed to be filled by the end of 2013. An article in the Daily Telegraph cited anonymous officials at the bank, who “privately point out that dealing with the failure of a major clearing bank today remains as dangerous and difficult as it was back in 2008, when Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS’s near-death experience brought the financial system as close to collapse as at any time in living memory.”

The only solution is the nationalisation of the banks and their transformation into social utilities under the control of the working people and taking back of the trillions stolen from the treasury and reinvested into rebuilding of the countries infrastructure, public services and NHS, creating millions of jobs. What the Greens and all the other parties offer is socialization of the banks losses and privatization of their profits...in other words socialism for the rich and powerful and capitalism for the workers and poor.",1,1366202007,null,0,1366209325,0,c9gy6im,t3_1cisvw,t1_c9gy6im,t1_c9gwi4z,null,1431527357,1,false,bristol,t5_2r52c,1

But all the events you did, everything you were involved in, happened, but just without you. This, of course, makes no sense per se, but it explains how can you exactly bring someone back just by remembering.

&gt; If it truly wiped you from existence, as if you never existed, all the decision you were involved in would be rewritten too, making a totally different reality. Think of it this way, how would Amelia be alive if her parents never existed?

&gt; So, although The Doctor was pulled out from reality, all of his feats remained.

So my first question is moot, I guess. Being pulled from a timeline doesn't alter any of the consequences of you being there - it is, in a way, more like a perception filter, then. Nobody can remember you, and IN A WAY you never existed, but you also did. Otherwise as soon as Amy's parents were erased, Amy would have been erased too. Call it what you want, but if the only real effect is being 'forgotten' I would call that a perception filter.

I'd place the blame on previous administrations that artificially propped them up beyond a short term recovery grace period. They should have begun the draw down as soon as soon as the industries showed they were long term unsustainable, and prevented the unions from overstretching their mandate of reasonable labour force protection into the realm of unreasonable self-protectionism. That way the communities could have been protected and moved onto new focal points.

Most of the industry-esque issues people blame her for seem to be symptoms of poor prior leadership.

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxford,"While it is a nice gesture, let's remember that that is all it is, a gesture. His ulterior motives are obvious. It's a PR move to make him and his company seem more generous and employee friendly than the other retailers.

Credit where credit is due, he seems to have kept Next functioning well in such a terrible retail climate and it isn't something he was *forced* to do, as far as we know.

But before we shout out praises about a change in corporate culture and an example to all, let's look at the numbers (from guardian and BBC articles):

* He shared out a £2.4m share based bonus (awarded due to the rise in share price) to his employees.
* This amounts to on average a 1% (£0.000124m) of salary bonus to his staff.
* Over the last year, Next shares increased 55%, pre-tax profits up 9% (~£60m).
* Last year, he received a pay rise of 13% (~£0.5m) to £4.7m for the year, made up of £1.1m base salary, £1.1m annual bonus, £2.5m long term shares performance bonus.
* The £2.4m bonus he is distributing was awarded to him *on top of all of this* (based on my interpretation of BBC article wording).
* His employees were given on average a pay rise of only 2% (£0.000250m) last year on an average salary of £0.0125m per year.

*Now* ask yourself, is it a one off PR stunt? Or does this signal a real change in corporate culture? Should that £2.4m (or the rest of his bonuses) be his to give away in the first place (was he solely responsible for the success of the company?)?

Myself, I'll reserve my praise for when I see some real change in pay scales and bonuses. By praising this too much, I think we're setting the bar too low. Far, far too low.

true,Sgt_General,,Do it for Redders 4: Never Stop Doing it!,"We did play genuinely good football, but not throughout the entire game. We found it difficult to play in the first half, because Burnley were getting in our faces and closing us down much more than Wednesday did in the previous game. Wednesday let us play then fouled us when we looked capable of doing something; Burnley did their best to ensure that we didn't do anything in the first place. This made the first half in particular a bit boring, as the players were rattled by Burnley's pressure, so they reverted to their old hoofing ways at times. In fairness, we did put Burnley under pressure in their half for extended periods of time (we had like four corners in a row at one point), but we didn't really look like scoring. On Saturday our delivery was always to the 'keeper, this time it was constantly heading towards the back post - and often overhit.

The only chance in the first half was Pearce's header, which hit the ground in front of goal and bounced off a Burnley defender before falling to Varney, who headed it off the crossbar and wide. Other than that, it was all wayward shots - mostly from distance - by both teams. In the second half there was a massive difference, as Leeds got the ball on the deck and **passed** it for extended periods of time (*We're Leeds United, we're passing the ball!*). We certainly looked the better team when we did that, aside from the end of the game when we struggled to keep the ball and Burnley constantly knocked balls into our box. The goal came from one moment of genuine quality by Diouf, who was really on form and making us tick, with some smart back heels and sharp passes in the second half.

There was more balance to the side and, as usual, we looked far better when passing the ball (this was the same under Warnock, to be fair, but he always reverted back to hoofing for some unknown reason) and players such as Austin and Varney seem to have really got some confidence now. Lees seemed rusty and not his usual self - he might take a game or two to get back to where he was - while Tonge put in the poorest performance of the night: the longer he kept the ball, the more likely he seemed to lose it. Still, a good result and a much improved performance compared to recent games.",0,1366204416,null,0,false,0,c9gypup,t3_1ch6mj,t1_c9gypup,t1_c9gwimh,null,1431527103,3,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,3

1)Why can't Rory remember his marriage and child in ""wedding of River Song""
A)Rory is brand new to time travel and remembering non existent events in comparison to Amy. Amy first lost rory, then had to remember everyone who fell into the crack, and then even ended up remembering rory too in the end (before he shot her) then she had to remember the doctor, and so she got the hang of remembering things that never happened really well. In the screwed up universe she is still not 100% certain, but she is trying her hardest.

If you look back at rory, he never had to be the one who remembered the even first. First he was dead, then he was plastic, then amy remembered him first, and then amy remembered the doctor. He always had the rebound memory effect. Someone remembers an event, and he follows up remembering. this is still because of him being a time traveler, because in the episodes before, there are cases where people just call you crazy for remembering events that never happened. In comparison to amy, he happens to be a a baby time traveler.

He eventually ends up remembering after amy once again does the remembering for him.

2)When amy goes back in time, she becomes and author. She then writes about her adventures of the doctor. This goes down in recorded history as a legend of the doctor. Just like billion of other events. since Amy remembers the event that never happened, she is free to write about it as if it did happen.

Thus, I gave them both naming schemes to prevent a new whovian from being confused as to what the fuck is going on. Its nice that you think you should correct me in your great and almighty wisdom about all that is doctor who, but in reality  you would be wrong, because you failed to grasp the concept that I was aiming for. If you continue to treat new comers how you treated me, you'll scare many people away from the show.

2)This are my favorite episodes, what gives you the right to disagree with what I said? The empty child is easily the scariest/creepiest episode in the show, the girl in the fireplace is the most emotional one (for me). blink gets second scariest, silence in the library is tied with blink. I love how sporadic and random the doctor is in the big bang, and the god complex is insanely deep and cool. And then asylum of the daleks, can you even challenge that? That shit as absolutely amazing.

*please note: These are only referring to the new seasons, not to the old doctor who*

3)Moffat wrote some good episodes in the past. It has nothing to do with it being him. Hell, I had no clue he wrote these until I researched him as to why the new episodes sucked so much in comparison.

4)I don't really care if they only watch the first season and decide its the best and never watch again, or if they only watch season 7. Its their choice. It would be awesome if they start with Season 1 of the new series, and continue on until they are caught up, but that is not our choice, and we can't and should not even force it on them.

But do you have to be so offensive on a personal level?  What I've said, if you believe it's right or wrong, is that I believe an allocation of money is deserved in one place and not another.  The rest of your post is fine, but why you chose to insult me in the first place is beyond me.  Do you do that to everyone who doesn't share your view?

**On what you've said:**

It should be noted that most government investments should be returning more than £2 for every £1 spent (I'm an economics graduate, do you have formal understanding of the topic beyond whatever newspaper you read?)

I believe most of what they do is a waste of time and money because their way of promoting art is the equivalent to if Sport England promoted Rugby by spending god knows how much to put a rugby ball on a plinth in the centre of London instead of actually getting people to play the game.

My opinion is different from yours, but that does not mean its blinkered, and if it is then I'll say the same about your opinion since it also differs from mine and apparently that means you're blinkered and ignorant.

I do endorse that position.  I see no benefit to the nation of spending god knows how much to put some sculpture in a public place as suggested before with my analogy to a rugby ball on a plinth.

Government is one of the things that makes Westminster so expensive so that's a pretty ""ignorant"" thing to say..and in those cases they need close communication (including physical) links to one another.  An arts council does not and could quite as easily operate from an office elsewhere.  The point being made is don't complain about money lost while sitting in some of the most expensive office space around - if they actually cared about using art to enhance the community and nation instead of showing off pretentiousness, they wouldn't think it acceptable to use a large chunk of their funding on easliy reduced rental prices.

I read a lot of stuff.  I'm taking this as another personal attack.

http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/harpurhey-the-worst-place-in-england-1108111

A TV show called 'People like Us' (BBC3) was about Harpurhey, and was pretty much panned for being a really critical view of the people living in the area. Some people I knew in High School appeared on it, and a girl I know from University also appeared on it but was basically vastly misrepresented. They filmed her for 5 months whilst she organized a charity karaoke night thing, got a load of music students involved, etc, and then they turned around and said they can't get a crew down to film the actual night. She ended up having one line on the show which was 'I wanna go on a booze cruise', which was just hilarious as they made her say it like 15 times to get it right. 5 months of filming for one line on a show.

Anyway, best to avoid Harpurhey and Moston especially I think.

Spurs: Man City - L, Wigan - W, Southampton - W, Chelsea - D, Stoke - W, Sunderland - W (71 points)

I don't think any of these results are unreasonable...To be honest, I also think we might be able to sneak out a win at Chelsea, because we play them mid-week, in between them playing ManU and at Aston Villa, who will be in a dogfight for relegation.


Arsenal: Fulham - W, ManU - L, QPR - W, Wigan - D, Newcastle - D (68 points)


First three are perfectly reasonable. Wigan gave Arsenal problems last match, and Arsenal only squeaked out 3 points because of a dive-penalty. Plus, we know how Wigan is at the end of the year. I don't think they'll do it to the same extent this year, but I can see them playing for the draw. The last match of the season for them is at Newcastle, and I just think Newcastle will be able to pull out a draw in the last match of the season, at home.

Chelsea: Fulham - W, Liverpool - D, Swansea - W, ManU - L, Spurs - D, Aston Villa - D, Everton - D (68 points)

Liverpool is in excellent form and that match is at Anfield. I see a high scoring draw, maybe 2-2. The draw with us, I explained in ours. Aston Villa is one that might stand out, but keep in mind that match is being played at Aston Villa and is the 6th match Chelsea will play in 16 days, because of Europa. Everton is a quality team that will still have a chance at Europa at that point, so a draw at home is not at all crazy.",0,1366207049,null,0,false,0,c9gzfds,t3_1cizao,t1_c9gzfds,t3_1cizao,null,1431526769,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4

1) So, this is a skill that gets easier with practice? Quote, supporting evidence beyond ""Amy does it best""? This seems like a cobbled together theory attempting to salvage some coherence to something that really can't be justified. And by the Wedding of River Song, Rory's been a time traveler for a season and a half. He has as much practice as Amy at time travel when she remembers him when he's a Roman. So, yeah, I don't agree with the idea that he's a baby time traveler, and that seems to ignore the actual time he's spent in the TARDIS. By WoRS, yes, Amy might be better at it, but in the time Amy's remembered all of her adventures, Rory should at least remember enough to have a vague sense of sadness at the wife he knows he can't remember. He hasn't even remembered enough to suggest to Amy that he's the one she's looking for in the pocket universe.

So, again, it seems like who remembers what is up to the writer, aiming for drama, tension, and empathy. Not some thought out, predetermined ability with dependable or random effects.

Also, you never explained Two Streams non-existence in Amy's head as she gets older.

2) I'll let this one slide.

She then gets random moments of sadness when she almost remembers him. Next comes the soliders in the episode with the angels. Amy spends a period of time remembering as 1 by 1 they all walk into the light and erased from time and space. Then we move on to when rory shows up again, and she once again remembers him after a brief delay. This is 2 different time she has remember erased events (More then that if you count each erased person) while rory has had zero experience remembering erased people, hes never even experienced someone being erased. His first experience comes with time being rewritten, but Amy remembers before him, and so he is helped tremendously on this event.

So in the episode were time skips, he does recognize her as someone that he really likes, and he just can't explain that. Part of him knows that there is something special about her, but he can't really put his finger on it. Meanwhile, Amy, who has remembered multiple people is also struggling with remembering, she can remember some events, including the doctor, but had an really hard time remembering rory (who she remembered completely before then). So why would you think that rory is going to easily remember his wife, when a person who has recalled several people who never existed can't manage to do it?

What do you mean by ""Also, you never explained Two Streams non-existence in Amy's head as she gets older.""

2) so we know for sure she has wroten atleast 2 books, one of them about the doctor. We then know that she loves the doctor and thinks he is one of the best people in the world. given that hundreds of times before we know that people write about the doctor, you find it hard to believe that she wouldn't write about him?

Check in interviews if they have employed people from internships and ask them how long they worked as interns for beforehand. A lot of companies take on interns with a view to employing them but want to check they're up to the job first and if they don't, one internship can lead on to something else. 


I took on an intern who had been working at another company for free, we gave him a paid internship because he already had the experience, he then left us a few months later to take up a proper graduate position at a large retailer - so it took him over a year to do but its paid off in the end.

the compassion to turn a country around in the face of ignorant socialists?

yes, it isn't like we had 14 years of Labour or anything oh wait...

&gt; The majority of the communities who's industry she destroyed still have high unemployment and the recovery that was starting before the recession has been destroyed, a recession which her policies have only exacerbated.

TIL her policies are still in place. she wasn't just a prime minister she was a time travelling super warlock. 

&gt; Young people are also finding it increasingly difficult to get on the housing ladder because of Thatcher's right to buy policy which saw social housing sold off and the funds ringfenced to prevent new housing from being constructed. By 1990 the number of houses built had fallen to 14,000, compare that to the 200,000 houses being built a year under Churchill.

so you disagree with her policy on home ownership, that's fine. many disagree with you and are delighted that they could own a home for the first time ever.

Not what I said at all, you were making it out like it was Dianna's funeral. It was nowhere near.

&gt;TIL the thousands who clapped and turned up for her funeral are 'right wingers'.

Mostly yes and some centrists.

&gt;the compassion to turn a country around in the face of ignorant socialists?

You mean the compassion to use rising north sea oil profits to hide the cost of putting industrial workers onto benefits. It's not like socialism doesn't work either, France went through similar problems to Britain especially regarding inflation and their socialist government under Mitterand was able to turn the country around without the pain caused by Thatcher's policies.

&gt;let him without sin cast the first stone. when was the last time you turned a country around?

I haven't enabled murder or been complicit in murder.

&gt;TIL her policies are still in place. she wasn't just a prime minister she was a time travelling super warlock.

Not all of her policies were abolished most notably the big bang. Eben then policies don't exist in a vacuum and the effects of a governments policies can be felt for generations.

 &gt;so you disagree with her policy on home ownership, that's fine. many disagree with you and are delighted that they could own a home for the first time ever.

I don't disagree with right-to-buy at all and I never said that. What I do object to is preventing the funds raised from selling these houses from being used to build new housing which is now preventing people from owning their first house.

Frankly the polls show a 50/50 split between those who think she was good and those that said she was bad or weren't sure and I expect a fair few of those who were polled as saying she was good are probably those people who say they don't like her but that she did what was 'needed'.",0,1366210375,null,0,false,0,c9h0h5s,t3_1cirsq,t1_c9h0h5s,t1_c9gzzl1,null,1431526275,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

murder? you're accusing Thatcher of murder now? do tell...

&gt; Not all of her policies were abolished most notably the big bang. Eben then policies don't exist in a vacuum and the effects of a governments policies can be felt for generations.

was there some kind of Thatcher forcefield around the Labour party for 14years? the answer is of course yes, the views of the public...

&gt; Frankly the polls show a 50/50 split between those who think she was good and those that said she was bad or weren't sure and I expect a fair few of those who were polled as saying she was good are probably those people who say they don't like her but that she did what was 'needed'.

true,lilsebastiansghost,null,null,"Personally, I preferred the style of play we *tried* to achieve under Solbakken. I thought it had more long term potential, being based more around keeping possession and keeping the ball on the ground. But, like potpan0 has already said we didn't have players capable of it (or willing to even try, in some cases).

Saunders has done well by rotating the team until finding those with desire, and his inclusion of youth is admirable. However, why some players don't get a sniff is confusing. What is the situation over Peszko? And why the dropping of Batth?

I am glad Doumbia has finally been given a run in the team under Saunders, because I have felt that since Solbakken's departure, for whatever reason, the centre midfield has been weaker than usual. Although there are questions about his fitness, he is willing to come deep and push up, providing us with a link (along the ground!) between defence and attack.

Overall I think signing Robinson was a good move from him, at the moment I am not convinced of Gorkss. I also agree with potpan0 that he is a bit immature (naive?) in managing at times, and the defensive backs to the wall display invites teams on, leaving me far from comfortable.

Doctor Who Season 5 episode 5: The flesh and Stone

Multiple soldiers walk into the cracks and time and disappear. Every time this happens, they forget about the guy that walked in and send someone else. Amy remembers them, but the others do not. She asks the doctor about this.

""AMY:
Then why do I remember it at all? Those guys on the ship didn't remember each other.

DOCTOR:
You're a time traveller now, Amy. Changes the way you see the universe forever. Good, isn't it?""

So because amy is a time traveler, she can remember things that never existed. Explained by the doctor.

So amy witnessed 4 people erased by time, and she remember them all. Crispen, phillip, pedro and marco. Amy: 4. Rory: 0

Then, Rory gets killed in 5x9 Cold Earth, and Amy struggles to remember him because now her own timeline is being rewritten, so remembering makes things much harder.

""
DOCTOR: 
Keep him in your mind. Don't forget him. If you forget him, you'll lose him forever.

AMY: 
On the Byzantium, I still remembered the Clerics because I am a time traveller, now you said.

DOCTOR: 
(grips her head in his hands) They weren't part of your world. This is different...this is your own history changing.

AMY: 
Don't tell me it's going to be OK. You have to make it OK.""

This is her first bit of experience, despite failing to remember him. This puts her expierences at Amy: 5, rory: 0 and actual memories Amy: 4, rory : 0. Correct?

Then we move on to 5x12: The pandorica opens. rory is a plastic robot designed to kill amy, and amy still doesn't know who he is

""AMY:
But I don't know you, I've never seen you before in my life.

RORY:
You have. You know you have. It's me.

AMY:
(backs away) Why am I crying?

RORY:
Because you remember me. I came back! You're crying because you remember me.""

then she remembers

""ORY:
Listen to me, you have to run. You have to get as far away from here as you can! I'm a thing. I'll kill you. Just go! Please, no, I don't want to go. I'm Rory! I'm... I'm...

AMY:
Williams. Rory Williams from Leadworth. My boyfriend. (holds him by the shoulders) How could I ever forget you?

RORY:
Amy, you've got to run. I can't hold on, I'm going.

AMY:
You are Rory Williams and you aren't going anywhere ever again.""

So the score is Amy: 5 rory: 0. shes done a lot more remembering of events that never existed then rory has at this point, wouldn't you agree?

then we move on to 5x13: the big bang

""AMY:
I remember you! I remember! I brought the others back, I can bring you home, too. Raggedy man, I remember you, and you are late for my wedding!

AMY:
I found you. I found you in words, like you knew I would. That's why you told me the story...the brand new, ancient blue box. Oh, clever. Very clever.

RORY:
Amy, what is it?

AMY:
Something old. Something new. Something borrowed. Something blue.

RORY:
It's the Doctor! 

RORY:
How did we forget the Doctor? I was plastic. He was the stripper at my stag. Long story.""

So now Amy remembered the doctor, and rory piggybacked on her memory of him. so now its Amy: 6 Rory:1/2

Then we move all the way to, Season 6x13 The wedding of river song

""
DOCTOR:
And if you try, if you really, really try, you'll be able to...

AMY looks at the TARDIS in his hand and the DOCTOR finally sees it.

DOCTOR:
Oh. Oh! (sees the drawings) Oh...

AMY:
You look rubbish.

DOCTOR:
You look wonderful. (tosses the TARDIS at her)""

She remembered the doctor

Then she remembers Rory, almost.

""DOCTOR:
OK, hugging and missing now. (breaks hug) Where's the Roman?

AMY:
You mean Rory! 

DOCTOR:
Mmm.

AMY:
My husband Rory, yeah? (holds up a sketch) That's him, isn't it? I've no idea, I can't find him. I love him very much, don't I?""

So Amy. We has remembered 6 people. 2 of them being people from her own timeline, and her own life. Still cannot remember rory. And you expect that rory should remember who the fuck amy is? Amy failed the first time that rory was erased, and so why would rory remember the first time amy was erased? That makes no sense.

So its perfectly and absolutely plausible that amy would remember the events better then rory would.

&gt;murder? you're accusing Thatcher of murder now? do tell...

What is the shoot-to-kill policy if not state sponsored murder, or do I need to also go into the type of people she called friends.

&gt;was there some kind of Thatcher forcefield around the Labour party for 14years? the answer is of course yes, the views of the public...

Labour hasn't been left wing for years. It has less to do with the public and more to do with politicians seeking to make money for themselves, Blair is a clear example of this.

I think that you just can't tell as much on screen, he may act more in love and relationshippy when he takes her on those wonderful trips, but during episodes it's always game time. It's always up to the doctor to be serious (at least in terms of concentrating on the task at hand) and save the universe. 

Also, he didn't have to marry her, she wanted to ""show him he was loved"" by the universe. She did that and was going to fix time like he wanted. He could have left it at that, but he then chose to marry her.

To address your last point, why would she not acknowledge him? When river meets the doctor she has no clue who she is, through thees meetings she falls in love with him.

No Bruce wasn't a great choice but he was better than messing around with three different guys with three very different attitudes.  Look at Hull now, look at Ipswich now.  The board got it wrong.


But talking about what we do have.  I liked Solbakkens ideas but we didn't have the players to implement it.  Also some of the players he signed got injured and didn't have time to bed in before things went pear shaped.  Saunders looks as if he will have given the players a new start and got them playing how they feel more comfortable.  His only job is to make us survive this season.  Give him next season to really see what he can do but I fear it will be a few years in the Championship building a new squad before we see the PL again.

&gt;strikes aren't inherent to socialism? I'm just glad she put an end to them anyway.

Of course not socialism aims to have the workers keep the full share of the value of their work where as a capitalist system does not do this and exploits people which is what leads to strikes.

&gt;do you have some evidence Thatcher endorsed this?

The first recorded killing under this policy was in 1982 and it was carried out by the RUC, British Army, SAS. [MI5 was also involved](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2000/may/23/northernireland.features11?INTCMP=SRCH). She was either wholly complicit in this or highly incompetent.

true,silvarus,tardis,TARDIS,"Your ""Cold Blood"" quote is directly misinterpreted. When The Doctor says ""They weren't part of your world. This is different...this is your own history changing,"" he seems to be implying that remembering Rory is different than remembering the clerics. Why? The clerics weren't a huge part of her life, they were a minor part she would never have met without time travel. However, Rory, like her parents, is forgotten. They are part of her life. Clearly they still existed, but all memory of them, and alternate reasons for the impacts they've had on the world are filled in. Look at Amy's response to the question of her parents when she's 7. She just says she doesn't have any, she doesn't offer a reason why. So, if it's something important to your natural (non-time traveling timeline), you forget, otherwise, you remember.

So, in my mind, the fact she could remember the clerics underground days later but can't remember Rory moments later prove the importance of the difference. 

The first time she remembers someone in her personal timeline, it's after heavy prompting by the Doctor and Rory, not some mystic ""Amy magically remembers better.""

Is the mechanism via which Amy remembers the Doctor ever adequately explained, beyond ""Good Nights"" statement that multiple histories currently exist and are competing for being the real past. Because of that, she somewhat remembers the Doctor, which he builds upon with his stories of the times that never came.

You are correct in saying that Amy's remembering the Doctor, bringing him into the current universe and history, did cause Rory to remember. However, through the magic power of ""Remembered references"", the Doctor manages to physically reincorporate. Like Amy being given her engagement ring, and Amy having Plastic Rory talk to her about her life, I'd imagine seeing the TARDIS materialize is more than a decent trigger for bringing Rory's memory's to the forefront. For comparison, we don't know if Amy's parents only remember the time line in which they exist, or if they remember non-existence.

In the Wedding of River Song, Amy remembers her adventures to the point she can draw pictures of the monsters, but she can't remember Rory. Why can Rory not remember that he has a wife, even though she remembers she loves a man named Rory? At that point, he's been on the TARDIS for as long as she was when he was Plastic, and he works with her, so she'd be constantly there to trigger his memory.

My missus has asthma so we are now able to go the pub when we almost never went pre-ban.  But we only go now and again, maybe a couple of times a month (usually with the kids).

That's great for us, and we usually go with other families and put £200+ through the till between us, but pubs rely on the regulars who are there most days and who provide most of the income.  A full pub at the weekend is one thing, but it's the cold Thursdays in February that you need the punters in.

The most successful pubs in our town have taken on the combined role of coffee shop, takeaway, restaurant and drinking pub.  One place provides free toast all morning, so it gets all sorts in: dog walkers, mums with buggies, retired people etc.  That keeps the cash flowing during the day, then in the evening the post-office crowd turn up, followed by diners and couples, then at the weekend it's popular with younger ""high volume vertical drinkers"".  So they have a steady cash-flow all through the week but at different times in the day it's a totally different client group.

true,GeneralRose,null,null,"1) I love how you managed to grasp the use of profanity. Also, knowing that he is the ninth incarnation is good information for a person new to the show to have.  

2) I misunderstood and thought that you were saying these are the absolute episodes you must see as a person new to the show. I meant that one should see episodes written by a variety of writers to get a better feel for the show.  

I do like the episodes you have listed, Empty Child/Doctor Dances remains one of my favorites to this day.  

Also, my only issue with Asylum of the Daleks is the ending. It seemed to me Moffat only erased the Daleks' memory of the Doctor so he could have that ""Doctor Who?"" moment. Personally, I think he did it while only thinking of his ""Silence Arc"" and without thinking of the decades of development the Daleks have had that he had just destroyed in an instance. Other than that, I loved the episode.  

3) Again, I misunderstood and believed you to be one of those ""only watch what Moffat has written and ignore everything else fans"". Clearly you are not one of those people. I'm sure you appreciate gems like Midnight.  

4) I agree with you, the can start wherever they want. I think for it make the most sense to a new viewer they should start with Series One or Series Five.  

Series One introduces Rose and the Time War it's themes are featured heavily throughout the next four series.  

Series Five introduces Matt Smith and a whole new production team. It has a very different feel at times to the previous series and can be seen to be going in a Different direction.  

I honestly would never expect a new viewer to start with Hartnell. The stories are great, but the production levels are low (even for their time, they were low) and the pacing is much different than modern television.

4th: The Sunmakers (Funny, political, and just a bit disturbed.)

5th: Warriors of the Deep (This is a rough one, in a great, sad way.)

6th: The Ultimate Foe ( This is the final episode in The Trial of a Time Lord, so maybe watch those to get this episode's feel. Also, you can begin to see where modern Doctor Who gets its influence. And, it's the most meta-licious with a semi-psuedo explanation of how we're watching the show, which the Wachowski brothers referenced.)

7th: I want to say The Greatest Show in the Galaxy because of its balls outiness but The Happiness Patrol is better executed and an absolutely marvelous three parter.

8th: Watch the movie, laugh at Eric Roberts. Yes, he could be half-human.

9th: Dalek (I would almost pick this for best episode of the entire series. So much said, so little time.

10th: The Waters of Mars ( Do not watch if having a bad day/week/month. It will make you hate my favorite Doctor.)

11th: The Big Bang ( I took back every bad thing I said about Steven Moffat and Matt Smith after this episode.)

true,daveime,eng-lancashire,Lancashire / Philippines,"The Guardian: Obfuscating the facts and fiction by focusing on ""Unemployment Benefit"" and people in / out of work, when in fact the thing that most people consider unfairest is those families that have 6 or 7 kids and qualify for copious amounts of child benefit and housing benefit because of it, regardless of whether Mum has a part-time job stacking shelves (and hence is ""employed"" according to the handy-dandy graphs) or not.

Personally, I'd phase out Child Benefit and the associated Housing Benefit ""perks"" due to the number of children altogether. Why we are paying a blanket benefit to anyone who manages to drop a sprog is beyond me? Technically, even a billionaire can qualify!

No, it needs to be phased out over the next couple of generations (15 to 30 years) so it doesn't immediately cause hardship without warning, for ALL families above a certain income level, so it only goes to the poorest in society, and also LIMITED to the first 2 kids only. If you want to go churning out sprogs every 9 months ad-nauseum, you'll have to look after them yourself.

Yes, anyone can fall on hard times, but that's still no excuse to keep having kids above the ones you have already. And in an overpopulated world of 7 billion people, having more than 2 is not just socially irresponsible, it's fucking globally irresponsible.

EDIT: Also, I'd do a number on pensions also. The State Pension should also be means tested, and not just given out willy-nilly. So they ""paid in"", big fucking deal. We all pay income taxes of one form or another, does anyone ever get the ""value"" back ? A person who pays NIC for 45 years will use all their contributions within 5 years of retiring. After that they're just an ever increasing drain on the current generation of taxpayers. It's a Ponzi scheme of the Nth degree, and it'll only become a heavier burden as we continue living longer.

In practice, the majority of people who go to the Opera are incredibly wealthy. If you sign up at the Royal Opera House's website they have a drop down for what title you hold. Seriously, I'm not making that up.

In practice, a load of people who don't like or want to fund Opera are subsidising people who can easily afford it.

And 4-0 down in half an hour. The shame of it, the gut wrenching 'maybe we are out of our depth...' feelings come back. 

I can clearly remember sitting in the pub, 5 Spurs fans sat excitedly in the exact same seats we had been sitting in since the Young Boys matches, but this time we weren't talking, barely aware we are in a public place the occasional 'fucks sake' could be heard. And then in walks my Arsenal supporting friend, who (unluckily for him), had no idea of the score and walks in saying 'so 4-0 lads?!' with a big smile on his face. It was horrible.

But then, then this player who had showed us greatness in fleeting moments for the last few years suddenly decides to step up, and in 5 minutes goes from 'lots of potential' to 'world class'. We walked out feeling like we'd won the tournament, it was amazing.

However I think the most troublesome thing is how the funeral appeared to be a state funeral but was sold as something else. This suggests to the world outside the UK that Thatcher and the Tories were loved during the 80s.

Purely at a practical level the right move would have been to reduce the original budget of the funeral to something more modest especially as the funeral is slap bang in the middle of cuts across the entire public sector. There have been other threads going into this in more detail so I won't derail but the fact that is was such a huge funeral for a figure that was not well loved at a macro level reeks of party politics.

Do we expect to have such funerals when John Major, Tony Blair or Gordon Brown pass away?

If you take a close look at the sample for Clara Oswin Oswald, you can actually see that the inner most circles representing ""Osw"" are the same in ""Oswin"" and ""Oswald"".

Edit: To add on to that, the main difference from Doctor's Cot Gallifreyan is that Doctor's Cot is based on the IPA, allowing it to be used for almost all langauges in the world.

&gt; However I think the most troublesome thing is how the funeral appeared to be a state funeral but was sold as something else. This suggests to the world outside the UK that Thatcher and the Tories were loved during the 80s.

I don't see how you can get that from a funeral. Fair enough it had a military element, but this was hardly the royal wedding with red arrow flyovers. The outside world are smart enough to look up the fact that Thatcher won 3 national elections and was the longest serving PM for 150 years, and first woman PM. For those reasons alone I think what I saw today was warranted, if not a bit subdued. 

That she was not well loved is redundant, in my opinion. She was a PM and a very successful one, and the first woman one. I think we'll see something similar for Blair. not for the others.

Therefore, either River knew his name before the transfer in the library, or the Doctor has an elaborate lie centuries in the making where he had a fake name he would give to someone who was not his wife. Since we know he did not tell her in The Wedding of River Song, either he told her after and they didn't show it, or it hasn't happened yet.

true,norney,null,null,"With respect I believe you are missing many of the salient points whilst sidestepping the other points. The lost generation is indeed a problem, and one which the welfare to work scheme does nothing to address; most of the long term unemployed are older rather than younger, whereas the participants in welfare to work are younger rather than older. 

In your opening statement you say 'it's not an argument' it's the reailty of the situation' whereas for the second and fourth points you say 'hopefully he'll have the same luck' and 'the aim of the scheme...'. Both of these points fail to address the reality of the situation, which is starkly different. 

The third point, well, that's just silly, naive, patronising and arrogant. BTW I am an employer and have been for the past 12 years, and no, I would not use slave labour if I was offered it but then again I do believe businesses do have a responsibility to contribute to society. 

It is a subsidy. A select group of employers can choose whether to pay for labour or instead for the welfare budget to pay for the same labour. 

No, small businesses are not subsidised in this way.

As for the university itself, I go there and I don't understand the credit system, but most courses incur very little contact time at all - Mine is somewhere in the region of nine hours per week. Aside from mandatory reading I don't have much more work to do apart from deadlined work that you can do any time before the deadline. People are friendly, the vast majority of the staff are nice and easy to get along with. Certainly at city campus even the old buildings are modern and really nice on the inside. 

Leeds is a great city, took me some time to get used to but its a really interesting place with lots to do. Has an amazing nightlife, so overall I'd recommend giving an exchange a shot.

- 3.5 years, no viruses, no malware
- It not grinding to a bloody halt after a year because the registry is all fucked up and incapable of being fixed (no, not the registry, what's that do-dah, you know when the clusters need to be fixed, it's escaped me)
- I've had to buy a new PC every 1.5 - 2 years and the 1,200 self-build lasted 1.5, we suspect it was probably a batch of faulty motherboards, but by then I just wanted to chuck it out of the window
- The ability to blow the machine up if you attach anything to it that the computer doesn't like: the wiring on the £20 speakers I bought (silly, in hindsite) nearly blew the bloody thing up the first time we booted it up
- Macs are PRETTY
- They work with my iPhone and iPad almost seemlessly
- As long as I can still chat my brother in law up (rather, ex brother in law), I can get the entire MS office for Mac suite for free plus a bunch of other stuff because he gets 5-person user licences. 
- I've yet to have a piece of spam hit my inbox (but that's probably gmail more than mac)
- Time Machine
- Spotlight search
- Doing everything (bar possibly one thing) that I NEED it to do
- Ratio of PC to Mac users something like 95% to 5% - if you're gonna get some nasty new form of virus or malware or whatever technological developments occur over the next few decades, the chances are very high that they won't be written for Macs

Christ, are you me? Apart from the long distance thing that's almost precisely what happened to me.

My ex is bi-polar. They have a very low level of self-worth. I do genuinely believe now that they really feel they are not good enough to be with those who love them. I'm still in touch with mine and he texts me all the bloody time (unemployed, no money, bored) but it feels like it's a part-time job for me to keep constantly boosting his confidence. AND I barely got an explanation too. It took me a year to get the 'I'm clinically depressed, and dumping you was the worst mistake I ever made' out of him. Because prior to that, all I got was 'all you ever do is criticise me all the time and I can't deal with it anymore' - a one line email, when yeah, we were going to get married too.

If your guy is genuinely depressed but not bi-polar, there may be some hope. If he is though, it's going to be a battle to get him back. 

I'm so sorry. HUGE HUG. I know just what this feels like. It took a year for me to be able to talk to him civilly because I was so hurt.

I try not to criticise him...and I don't think I have, but there's only so much I can do from afar, especially as I think he was distancing himself from me for the past couple of weeks. I don't even know if he wants me back. Going to let him see if he still wants me as I don't want to force it and I'm still hurt. And he's not currently prepared to move countries. Maybe he'll realise his mistake later but it could be too late by then (I have a track record of not staying single for long. I've essentially been permanently dating someone for 4 years...should really have a bit of time between this and the next one this time!).

Yeah we talked on friday night and I was civil for some of it...but not most of it. I guess I just wanted to hear a proper apology? 

Thanks, HUGE HUGS back :) It mostly just sucks because he was my best friend and the one I always sent interesting reddit links, or things I saw whilst out and about and now I don't have that.

If he's clinically depressed this is not going to happen. He won't feel that he has any value to offer in a relationship. He needs to address what is depressing him and/or get some therapy or get on some pills in the short term to help (they're not ALL as addictive as they used to be).

CBT (Cognitive Behaviour Therapy) also helps. Source: formerly clinically depressed best mate, plus the bi-polar ex.

Also, a lot of people don't know they're bi-polar because they can have it one year but then not for another half a dozen or more.

true,executivemonkey,null,null,"[Here](http://floridacwc.com/frequently-asked-questions/#register) is some information from Florida's concealed handgun program.  Florida and Alaska are, as I understand it, the most permissive gun states.

In Texas, I think that less than 5% of people have a concealed carry license (source: http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2010/10/robert-farago/one-out-of-every-60-texans-has-a-concealed-carry-license/).  Note that it is not a 2013 or 2012 source, so a higher percentage of Texas's population might have permits by now.  But certainly it is not the case that even one in every ten Texans has a concealed license.  Over one million Floridians have such a license, however.

Hawaii, which is a very liberal state, has published information indicating that concealed handgun licensees are much less likely than members of the general public to commit violent crimes.  [Source](http://hawaiiccw.com/gun-myths/concealed-carry-myths/people-permits-commit-crimes/)  That might be due to the background checks, fingerprinting, and pistol safety courses that concealed carry licensees are required to complete.

The fact that concealed carriers are generally able to use guns safely suggests a path to successful gun control.  Concealed carriers have to complete background checks, be identified in a way that would help connect them to any crime they might commit, and take a gun safety course.  Canada imposes similar restrictions on all gun owners and has much less gun violence than the US.  We'd be better off if anyone who purchased a gun had to go through that process.

Members of the general public can buy guns online or second-hand without a background check or any kind of registration.  People who want to use a gun to commit a crime would likely take that route or purchase through a straw buyer.

Open carry restrictions [vary from state to state](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_carry_in_the_United_States#Diversity_in_State_Laws), with some states allowing anyone with a legal gun to carry it in the open.

The vast number of guns in the US and the ease with which a criminal can acquire a gun from a gun seller probably contribute to the cautious attitude of law enforcement towards the public.  For example, in my city, the police often approach a car with one hand on their pistol when making a routine traffic stop.  They typically take an aggressive and distant stance when interacting with the public.  There is an ""us-vs-them"" mentality among the police, one in which the police see themselves as akin to a military force fighting against an enemy (criminals).  The police often seem to perceive members of the public as potential combatants.  They are heavily armed.  When I was attending university in Texas, the campus police - not the city police, but the on-campus officers - carried AR-15 assault rifles in their cars.

I have never seen an officer dealing with someone engaged in open carry, but I imagine it would involve the officer talking to the person and trying to determine whether the person had any malicious intent, and perhaps encouraging the person to be more discrete to avoid scaring people.

Concealed carry is usually dealt with by the carrier informing any officers with whom he interacts that he is a concealed carrier so that the gun does not surprise the officer.  In Texas, a person who brandishes a concealed gun without being in a situation where use of a gun would be proportionate self-defense will be treated as a criminal; then again, Texas is not an open carry state.  I do believe that brandishing is a crime even in open carry states, however.  You are able to carry a gun, but not use it to threaten people or place them in imminent fear of harm.",0,1366228980,null,0,1366229366,0,c9h7qag,t3_1chckh,t1_c9h7qag,t1_c9gw0rj,null,1431522784,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

Supposedly it takes thousands of years to grow a TARDIS but, of course, time isn't strictly linear and all that. Anything could have happened to speed the acquisition of a TARDIS for Rose/Meta10.  It could be the Meta-Crisis 10's TARDIS. (Edited to Add: KeybladeSpirit reminded us that it's specifically said in the scene that speeding the growth of the TARDIS was possible. KeybladeSpirit and 1morematt both posted links to the scene below, for those interested.)

Theoretically a new TARDIS wouldn't need to look like the police box since it wouldn't be built with the broken Chameleon Circuit, but I imagine, at this point, if the Doctor could choose what the TARDIS would look like he'd choose the police box hands down. :)

He told the robbed and misruled and exploited and driven people to disobey their plunderers, he denounced the profiteers, and it was for this that they nailed his quivering body to the cross and spiked it to the gates of Jerusalem, not because he told them to love one another. That was harmless doctrine. But when he touched their profits and denounced them before their people he was marked for crucifixion.” - Eugene Debs
