That's *part* of what it's about. Bear in mind I'm not a conservative, I'm so far left you could almost call me a communist. The idea, economically, is that if you have few regulations and low taxes then businesses will grow and flourish (Laissez-faire) and that by imposing regulations and taxes you make it more difficult for business to thrive.

So when a Conservative says ""let's lower the taxes big businesses have to pay"" it isn't because they're thinking ""Then they'll be able to give me even more money next election!"", it's because that's their proposed solution to the economic issues.

Another aspect of the hereditary tax is ethical. Do you believe you and the government have the right to tell somebody they cannot leave money to their children after they die? Can you ethically justify your stance?

On top of that, do you see the hereditary tax as a means of returning the favour to the government by giving some amount of what they've spent on you during your life (which is what it should be about), or as a means to drag the rich down to the poverty of the poor?

But in all seriousness, I think it's whatever you make of the experience. Maybe you could make a friend while you're there and he/she knows of work going elsewhere; network with people, find out about their experiences looking for work.

It shows several things to an employer, whether they're in retail or not. For a start you obviously wouldn't just say you stocked shelves. Some graduates don't have any work experience, no evidence that they have any customer service skills, or even a basic ability to communicate with other staff. Does it help them get a job specific to their degree? Perhaps not, but many graduates don't anyway for various reasons.

true,BagelGnome,null,null,"I did ""Work Experience"" for PC World for 2 months because it was loosely related to my chosen field (that being IT).

I can very well say I experienced the mind-numbing task of stacking shelves, deliveries on Monday &amp; Friday and floor walks Tuesday, Wednesday &amp; Thursday, I wasn't allowed to sell so transferable experience was near to zilch.

I would usually start around 12pm, on a Monday/Friday the store's delivery would be awaiting me to solely unpack, tag and then place on the shop floor made harder by the fact I wasn't allowed to be in their stock room on my own.

PC World told be that thanks to my ""stellar"" performance they would consider taking me on which I agreed to, after many requests never materialized, probably a lie to make me stay for the full duration of the placement.

Makes me think who actually took on that responsibility before/after.

The bad things however were that the management seemed to have no clue what the rules regarding the scheme were and for the first week pressured me to do as many hours as possible.

My first weeks hours worked clocked in at around 45, which didn't feel right at all and after talking to my mother and a stern conversation with the JCP the working hours issue was resolved.

The biggest kicker being I was conveniently not told that I could drop out of the placement without penalty within 7 days, hardly surprising these days since I can't get a word of clarification out of their so called ""advisers"" who are happy enough to refer you to schemes/programmes and forward over your personal information but lack even basic information about them.

Had I been paid for this I would have earned an additional £1000.40  (before tax) with lower rate JSA taken into account and 2011 NMW.

I agree that the scheme CAN be helpful but not in its current state of being a revolving door of free labour.

I'd like to add that I don't feel I am above stacking shelves, but to expect people to work 30 hours a week for effectively £1.87 an hour is disgusting, and am surprised that people still believe the drivel that leaks out of IDS' mouth.

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; I can't help but think that your definition of necessities of life is probably something other than shelter, food, and drink. In what way is that system depriving you of those things?

The British Isles have a limited area.

We all need some square metres of soil in order to put a roof over our heads and in order to feed ourselves (whether that is by farming a few chickens or undertake web-design, or any other economic activity). 

We do not share this resource fairly and equally, but allow land owners to monopolise it, and it is the state enforces that.

You cannot have property ownership without deprivation - that's what property ownership means, *the right to deprive others* of whatever you own.

If you want to use say that property is the ""right to enjoy"" something then you have to add the word *exclusively* to that - property is the *right to enjoy something* to the *exclusion* of all others (I have the *right to enjoy* all the books in the library and the M1 motorway, but I don't *own* them).

So, *oh whoops!*, I've made myself look like a radical communist, but it's important one recognise this definition and state of affairs before one starts any kind of political thinking or debate - it's worthless having a ""political opinion"" if you don't even know what we're talking about. 

Of course you should be free to exchange your labour with Argos' money, to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. But the economies of this bargain would look hugely different if we didn't first deprive the poor of the resources they need to put a roof over their heads and food on the table.  

""The system"" you refer to in your previous comment is the one that monopolises the British Isles and says ""if you don't like it, mate, then tough luck, you can sleep in the street"". 

If we demanded that the state put a roof over every citizen's head, in exchange for that monopoly, in exchange for the state's right to rule us, then the bargain between employer and employee would likely be much, much fairer.",0,1361740058,null,0,false,0,c8ky4pd,t3_194v1l,t1_c8ky4pd,t1_c8kxp68,null,1431394095,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Because it's the key to understanding that greed is seen as a negative trait. eg. It's classically described as one of the seven deadly sins. 

So whilst you didn't use the word malicious, I can honestly say that calling someone greedy is saying that their accumulation of wealth is a negative thing. Likewise, it would be wrong of me to say it's not malicious to suggest you're being a prick. I'm not actually suggesting you're acting like a prick, but, well. You know. 

Anyhow. 

If ignoring a whole significant part of a definition doesn't help you to understand what the word means,please allow me to patronise you a bit more.

Read that. 

But here's another example. My hard drive is only half full. I don't currently need it to be larger than it is. 

I am currently possessing more storage space than I need. Your narrow definition implies I am being greedy. Except I'm not am I? 

I'm being cautious, planning ahead, and all sorts of other words.

If I were an employer a certificate like this would be totally worthless in proving that.

I don't give a monkey's what your CV says, I only care about the abilities you can prove to me.

If you look in /r/programming, for example, you will see loads of examples of hiring tests. Astonishingly [the majority of candidates can't even complete fizzbuzz](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-program.html), even when they've been ""working as programmers"" for years.

So a piece of paper like the OP's - that means nothing to me. Your mate could have printed that off at work for all I know.

So if you want to prove to me your ability to get into work regularly and consistently, prove it to my face. Otherwise I'll just pick some other guy who's worked 5 or 10 years in the same job, who looks like he's a decent worker, on the basis that his previous employers would probably have found a way to get rid of him if they'd had the chance. Or I'll employ an ex-con or an immigrant with a heavy accent, on the basis that they're likely to be more grateful for the opportunity.

Of course both those people then end up taking half their house and using it to buy two new houses. Although some remarry and move in with new partners, many don't. In the past people traditionally bought a house and stayed together in it.
* A decade of chronically poor housing construction has created a massive backlog of people who want to buy. Its hard to say, but you're probably talking about several million 25-35s who want to get on that ladder, but are stuck in a rental trap.

So why doesn't anybody want to come and visit your house?

* Because the only people that can afford it already have houses - and the reason they can afford it is because they have paid down a large part of their mortgage and have cash to put down for a deposit.

Lampard bombs on trying to reach the record goal tally at any opportunity, leaving Mikel or whoever trying to cover. Lampard does not have the tactical discipline to play the position, but because of how poorly we have managed our squad he has to play basically week in week out. Furthermore the central attacking midfielder tends to be Mata nowadays and he does not drop deep to play a central midfield role. What we play is far from a 433, and in fact our 4231 is easily overrun when opposition managers know how to attack it. The problem is Rafa (and to a certain extent RDM) do not change the tactics according to our opposition. It's very much like Arsene Wenger. We play our way whatever the opposition, and let's just try to beat whoever's in front of us, be it Manchester City or Brentford. 

Jonathan Wilson at the Guardian goes over why our particular formation, especially nowadays, is very vulnerable. Other managers have moved on, yet we are stuck with Rafa playing it every match. 

http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2013/jan/15/the-question-4231-football-tactics

I agree with you that our problem isn't necessarily the players. As I've said elsewhere our players seem to be the type who need a kick up the arse, and Rafa is definitely NOT the type to do that. He tinkers with his starting line-up, plays 4231 (which I believe IS a major weakness of ours, especially with the way Rafa lines up the starting eleven), makes a like-for-like sub at sixty-something minutes, another one at eighty-something minutes, the match is a total bore, and we probably lose if the opposition has any nous about them. 

Basically the problem is Rafa and everything that comes with him...his lack of leadership, his dull and uninspiring personality (which definitely does not motivate the players), his terrible substitutions that don't seem to make any difference, his baffling starting elevens (for instance playing Mata every single minute of every single game when it's clear he needs a rest), his stubbornness, and almost definitely yes, his insistence on playing 4231 no matter what.

When people go on these work placement schemes, not only are corporations getting free labour, but they're often getting a government subsidy on top of it.  So the government is paying twice and you're getting nothing out of it.  The only one benefiting is the corporation.

At least if you were being made to work for the Red Cross, or a local museum, etc., the community (which includes you, incidentally) would get some benefit out of it, and you *might* actually end up with something on your CV that would help you get a job.

&gt;Well, I guess we're going to have to agree to disagree.

I guess we don't, the stated reason for the job center putting someone on a mandatory work scheme is ""

&gt;A Jobcentre Plus adviser may refer someone to a work placement that is of ‘benefit to the local community’ if they feel a claimant has little or no understanding of the behaviour that someone needs to show in order to get a job and keep it. "" [2]

Given that these are the types of people who previously had no employment prospects, I find it greatly positive that as many as 20\% of those taking part in these schemes *have* been offered permanent jobs [3]. Don't you?

You say:

&gt;Otherwise I'll just pick some other guy who's worked 5 or 10 years in the same job,

And how exactly am I meant to prove that to you if I have *never* worked before? Surely you agree that having taken part in one month of ""unpaid"" work in, say, Argos would make me a better candidate for a job in, say, B&amp;Q? I suggest that for myriad reasons, not least the fact that I have proved myself capable of going into work consistantly: the scheme required that you not abandon it half way through [4].

You said

&gt;So a piece of paper like the OP's - that means nothing to me. Your mate could have printed that off at work for all I know.

Well lets be clear- the signed certificates authenticity could easily be checked by calling the HR department of Argos.

So to reiterate, if you had two candidates for an UNSKILLED job, neither of whom has ever had work before and you were interviewing them. Would you choose the one who had HARD PROOF that he could get off his arse and into work regularly and consistently, or the one who didn't?

Go back and read what I said. I didn't say ""deprivation"" as in a catch-all term for poverty, I specifically said that ownership is the right to deprive others the use of something.

Funny after I wrote that I was thinking about what constitutes a world class.  I think it'd be generous to say that a player is world class when a fair argument could be made for him to be in it over other players of like  position.  World class is subjective but at the end of the day you gotta be better than others to be in it.

Gerrard is playing as a centre midfielder.  Gerrard's primary roles are to control tempo, win balls and distribute balls by short and long, diagnal passes.  His auxiliary role is as a CM who attacks, this occurs late in the game when we're down after a horrendous defensive mistake.  This position is analogous to what Xabi Alonso used to play right?   

So the top midfielders who play this kind of position would include off the top of my head Xabi Alonso, Xavi, and Pirlo.  As much as I love Gerrard, all these players are better than Gerrard at their position and arguably better overall.  

IMO, a fair argument can't be made to include Gerrard over these other players who are in like positions thus Gerrard is not a world class player.  ",0,1361745440,null,0,false,0,c8kzp44,t3_193wmt,t1_c8kzp44,t1_c8kzcv6,null,1431394843,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

If your Great Aunt Matilda found a signed Tom Baker-era ""Doctor Who Sings the Blues"" album, people want to see it.""

Because the tube's aren't privately funded. They're paid for partly by government grant. Tube drivers are not worth £50k a year to do a job which could be done by someone on £30k or even a computer, for the most part.

If it was a totally free market, with the tube being run privately, no unions holding London to ransom, and supply and demand was allowed to dictate their salaries, then I wouldn't have a problem.

No, if I was going to jealous of someone ""wealthy"" it wouldn't be of someone who's on £50k. I don't even work yet, I'll start two weeks after I finish uni and I'll be on above the UK median salary.

true,SoyBeanExplosion,eng-yorkshire,York/Cambridgeshire,"&gt;If you're saying that dead people can own things, then it's you who need to justify that.

&gt;Inheritance is just a social construct by which society acts like dead people still have their free will.

I'll assume you were either tired, drunk, or high while writing that. Do you understand what a [will](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_\(law\)) is? The dead don't need free will, they just need free will before they die to write what they want done with their possessions after it.

&gt;I see an awful lot of talk about ""the government"" doing this or doing that, like it's some kind of 300' tall monster which has walked out the sea to attack us. In a democratic society the government should be an expression of the peoples' will - no more than that.

Neatly dodging the question. Yes, but the government has limits. Citizens have rights, regardless of whether or not the government likes to respect them. Not just the UN declaration of human rights and the Human Rights Act 1998 but legal rights that already exist within our country. Do you believe it is ethically justifiable for the government to tell a person that they cannot leave the possessions of their choice to their children?

&gt;It is a simple fact that we cannot have a fair and equal society if some are born rich and others are born poor.

No, it is not. You're making shit up. What matters is equality of opportunity. We can't guarantee that every person will grow up in a rich family, it's 100% impossible and unrealistic, what we can do is make sure that the same opportunities are there for those who wish to make use of them. A fair and equal society can be achieved if everybody is offered the same opportunities to make their lives as good as possible. Not everyone has to, or will, make use of them, but it's our duty to make sure they have the option, not that they have to choose it.

&gt;So, no, I don't wish to drag anyone down, I just wish to raise up the poor to be the financial equals of those hereditary aristocrats I see in Tatler each month.

Except that everything you've said so far says the opposite. Hereditary tax does not raise up the poor, it just brings down the rich to your level so you can feel ""if I'm not doing well then why should he?"" It's nothing more than petty revenge.

I don't have a problem with striking when your human rights are violated or a company breaches your contract. However, TfL has had agreements re bank holidays with tube drivers, who earn more than £45k, and their latest strikes have been over wanting even more to cover bank holidays. This is holding a company to ransom IMO. If the shoe was on the other foot, i.e. they were due to be paid more for bank holidays and then TfL just didn't, then I would understand that they were upset. However, I still wouldn't condone striking in this case, not when you're on £45k to do something fairly easy and it's just being selfish.

If striking were the only way to ensure that you were paid reasonably, then everyone who didn't strike would be on minimum wage. Striking causes massive distortions in the labour market.

If only a few people were able and willing to drive trains for a living, then they would be able to charge a premium. If anyone could do it, then they would be on very little pay.

Lets be honest the last few festivals have been going a little downhill (not musically), especially regarding the way people have been enjoying it. Getting completely trashed while trashing the city center isn't exactly brilliant. Added to that the complication of more and more people it'd have reached critical mass shortly anyway.

The way they seem to be going about it by promoting the fringe acts in local pubs and clubs and putting on fewer stages but increasing the impact of those stages is a natural evolution. The concert at the Pier Head showed it could be a great location and the African Oaye (sp?) showed the regeneration in Sefton Park off. The council/private companies have shoveled money into these two areas comparatively recently (If you're wondering about Sefton Park, its the glass house) so they want to maximize their returns.

Essentially its getting the best of both worlds (music+festival atmosphere) while reducing the downsides, what some might see as the 'heart' of the festival - the excessive all day bender - that blights the Matthew Street Festival.

Well in our society a person's value is linked to their ability to attract a partner and that goes for men just as much. If someone told a man he couldn't get laid no-one would interpret that as a sexist remark.

&gt;He is using insults related to a specific gender rather than general ones. I would say it's hypocritical as he says he places great value in western culture's treatment of women compared to his view of Islam, but then he would use a woman's gender as a way to insult her, seeming to view her as a lesser person due to her gender himself.

Everybody uses gender specific insults, 'bitch', 'dick', 'wanker', 'asshole', 'whore', 'douchebag' and so on and so forth. You're really grasping at straws here to link a gender specific insult to viewing someone as a lesser person due to their gender.

true,thornbrook,present,Frank Lampard,"I thought we defended quite well, obviously Cahill was exceptional in that regard. And Cech was solid.
Without them, who knows what the scoreline would have been.

I was disappointed with Mikel's lazy defending on the first goal, and in general.
Rodwell nearly scored 2 goals on his lazy defending as well.
He really baffles me.
For most of the game, he was quality - then he just has these moments where he just goes to sleep and walks around.

Ramires was downright awful today, and aside from his speed - I really don't see how he can be a starting player for us. He can't control the ball. AT ALL. His passing and tackling ability is also just awful.
He to me was directly at fault for the 2nd goal, and had several chances to create something at the other end that he fluffed - both of these incidents due to the fact he just can't control the ball at all.

At times its really like watching under 10's in the park when I was Ramires try to dribble.

I would much rather see Benayoun on the pitch honestly. 
He provides the same level of energy, but safer ball control at the cost of some speed.

Ba was trying, but they couldnt get him involved.
Same as whats happened with Torres for the past 2 years.

I cant say I expected to win this game, but I was disappointed with several of our players.

Cahill was such a beast though - I was stoked with his effort.

That's assuming that anyone could do any job. Which isn't the case. A doctor wouldn't be on minimum wage just because there is an unemployed shelf-stacker available who'd be a doc for minimum wage.

&gt; Public services can't be run on supply and demand, they are a necessity, a public good. 

No but their labour markets can. Just because something is a necessity doesn't mean you need to pay staff more than someone equally as able would be willing to work for. If anything, over paying public sector workers is to the detriment of the country as it's taxpayers' money which could be used for something else.

The job search was reasonably fun, thanks. I've already found a job before leaving uni.

Sure, it may work out as significantly below minimum wage, but you are still receiving money. Whilst unemployed I think you can also receive other benefits too, such as free/cheaper dental care. I realise that you aren't paid a direct wage for the work you do. But I think the trade off between what you get and how much you work, sounds pretty reasonable to me. And for someone with little work experience, it may be the difference between them getting work in the future or not. 

Why should you pay tax and NI in the first place? Because it pays for various vital services that most of us, our family, and friends will use/need at some point.

Edit: Just wanted to add, that I'm pretty sure they can withdraw your JSA for various reasons after you enter in to the agreement. Receiving JSA is dependent on doing what they deem best for you to get back in to employment, which I'm sure not everyone agrees with, but if everyone had better alternatives then I guess no one would be on JSA in the first place!

I'd say if a man had made this argument he would have been called misguided or stupid but he wouldn't have had any attack on his ability to find a partner like the woman did in this case. I guess it's open to interpretation.

With regard to gender specific insults, I wouldn't say there are any purely male ones anymore, at least in the social environment I'm in. I'd call someone of either gender a 'dick' or a 'wanker'. No one I know would call someone a wanker to accuse them of being a male who masturbates, it's just a generic insult to someone. 
However, 'bitch' and 'cow' are female specific insults. It seems to me like an attempt to try and put the person in their supposed place by using a gender specific insult rather than approaching them on a level and trying to refute their argument. Again, it's an inference whether or not they were treating her any differently because she's a woman, but I and I think a lot of others would think that they were.

You realise you've just made a judgement about me without properly reading my comment and then criticised me for apparently judging Calvin and Hobbes without reading it? You realise you're being a bit of a defensive hypocrite here?

* A large amount of navigable rivers and plentiful port-cities allowed countries (especially the UK) to transport goods far cheaper than would be available over-land. This geographical advantage also allowed food to be transported quicker before it spoiled, allowing for large population centres.

The government are giving money to Argos for them to have people at these programmes but you are expected to incur travel costs on an already small amount to live on. There is no information provided at the start of a programme there is any fucking jobs available at all and at a bare minimum, companies should have to provide proof there are positions available before anyone starts there.

I am currently unemployed and not only are the government a joke, but the companies that have received large contracts from the government to 'find me work' are fucking sickening. Last week I was practically forced to attend a 'work trial' which was unreasonable for many different reasons and was threatened that it would be reported if I didn't attend it. The place of work was quite a travel but I was willing to do that. Next I was informed that i would be required to work after 12pm after I stated my last bus home was at 11:27. That means a taxi would be the only options costing about £14 every fucking night and this was on a 16HR a week contract.

So, the next day I went down to the office where the job programme is and went ape shit. They only want me in work so they get their money which is given to them by the government after they find me employment. It doesn't matter if the job is feasible or how suited it is to your area of skill, they just want their money and fuck you for having the balls to call them out on it.

I told my advisor I'm not going to be pushed into a job where I would get less money than being on the dole which I was way over qualified for. They have now passed on the information to the job centre where i can 'appeal' any decision that goes against me.

I want to work but the job they forced me have a trial for wasn't realistic because of the cost of travel vs the actual shitty minimum wage on low hours.

true,safaridiscoclub,cnty-england,Reading / Gt. Yarmouth,"&gt;  do you think if you offered them a job stacking shelves at Tesco for £2 an hour they would say no?

Not that I would condone offering £2 a week... However, I imagine they wouldn't turn it down if they were offered 40 hours and could walk to work, no. That'd be £80 a week, if they lived with someone they could afford a bedsit/hostel room and some food every week. Some bedsits in Norwich, within walking distance to the city, only cost £60 a week. They could even live by themselves and have £20 left over to live off. Problem solved, one less homeless person. It would be a poor quality of life but it'd be better than living on the streets.

One thing to consider though, that if minimum wage were to be abolished, and wages did drop so low, more jobs would be created, leaving fewer unemployed, driving demand up for labour, and the going rate, and the prices would stabilize again. Germany doesn't have a minimum wage, and their median wage is similar to ours, I think about £2500 less.

true,rage-quit,scottish,Scotland,"There really isn't much to that story.

It really all revolved around me putting in formal complaints that my work advisor wasn't doing their job properly. I'm a web designer and former small business owner, yet they were trying to make me work construction jobs, cafe jobs and cleaning jobs and basically every time I approached them about getting travel funding for a job interview in Dundee / Aberdeen and even as far away as London, I was essentially laughed at and told that I should be looking for a ""regular job"" not trying to get a job in the sector that I have my degree in, as well as a small amount of studio experience.

Being told I quote ""have to go do on-site construction work for a minimum of 8 weeks or lose your JSA and be unable to reapply for 6 months"" was really the last straw. Their manager really did not care either it was essentially ""Well you better do that then"". It took a 3 hour phone call to their regional head office to sort everything out. They still didn't help me get work in my sector, but now at least they're not pushing me to work jobs that I'm overqualifed for for free.

Along the same lines, my dad, who is 50, has been registered as severely disabled since 1996 and also has severe dyslexia was recently told he had to go back to work. He was never notified that he was to begin meeting with the Job Center for JSA. Had his money stopped this week and was essentially humiliated in the Center after telling them he was dyslexic, the woman proceeded to read everything back to him very slowly, like you see those really dick British people abroad talking to non-english speakers.

To be frank, he deserves a club that is competing for major trophies, not necessarily a club that is trying to get back to a level to compete for major trophies. If Suarez is going to leave, there will be a bidding war. We will cash in on a player who we got for incredible value. We should be able to sell him for anywhere between 40-60 mil for him. We're also going to be getting Andy Carrol money this summer too.  So that's another 15-20 mil (depending on the source). Combine that with any other sales and investment from FSG and we can be talking about having a TON of money available to spend on the squad. I know it would really hurt for Luis to go, and trust me I do not want that at all, but I honestly don't think it would be that awful. In fact I could possibly see it being a good move. 

Also, lets not forget, Rodgers has developed a system and identity for us now.  We will be able to plug different players into the system and play our brand of football. Suarez is not solely responsible for making the system work. I think what I would miss most about Suarez is his passion for the club. That is something that cannot be replaced, but his role in Rodgers system can.

true,RabidRaccoon,cnty-expat,Expat,"&gt; Benefits aren't too high - the problem is on the other end.

The problem with saying that is that benefits come from the government. The government has a large deficit. The best way to cut that deficit is to reduce benefits and force people back into work. That way rather than costing the government money they'll pay taxes and thus fund it. 

Meanwhile who's to say that wages are too low? By global standards that is not the case. And it's not like an entry level position at Argos is going to generate loads of cash for Argos. Rather companies like Argos hire people in entry level positions in the hope that they'll do well, get promoted and eventually generate loads of cash. So the idea that Argos is exploiting people by underpaying them is really not supportable.

What this

&gt; We have given a job to two out of four and one refused the job because they were guaranteed more money on the benefits they were receiving than the contract hours the store would give.

tells me is that if there were no benefits at least one of those people would have taken the job. The fact that you can choose not to work and still live pretty comfortably by global standards means that people do choose not to work.

I'd agree with this

http://labour-uncut.co.uk/2012/01/04/labour-is-for-the-workers-not-those-avoiding-work/

&gt; 3\)     People who claim benefits that they are not entitled to, or who abuse the system in order to avoid work, undermine the system for those who are entitled to benefits. Does this mean that we are allowing notions of the deserving and undeserving poor? Yes, too right we are. If you can work and choose not to, then you do not deserve to be supported by those who are working. And we should not be ashamed to say so or to clamp down on them. Allowing people to live a life on benefits if they are able to work is not only unfair on tax payers it is also immoral. It condemns thousands to a life of poverty, kills aspiration and can all too easily become inter-generational.
&gt;
&gt; 4\)     People should expect to have to pay something for the benefits that they receive.  We all understand how insurance works – you pay a premium so that if the insured event occurs you can claim. If you have never worked and never paid tax then you should not expect to be able to claim. Does this mean that there shouldn’t be a safety net? No. But it certainly means that it should be just that – a safety net with limits. If you have paid your premium, then you should expect to be reasonably supported. But this support should be linked to expectations that you will endeavour to move off benefits as soon as you are able.",0,1361759446,null,0,1361761565,0,c8l3rn3,t3_194v1l,t1_c8l3rn3,t1_c8l2v6m,null,1431396810,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3

true,thecritic06,null,null,"I was wondering what everyone here thinks of this peculiar relic. This, the pilot, was broadcast once in 1990 and was immediately cancelled. It has never been repeated, nor have any of the other episodes ever been seen. Reading a synopsis, it sounds like a joke from Time Trumpet, TV Go Home or The Day Today. Watching it, you realize that no, actually, it was really made. And it's actually quite funny. There are some brilliant/horrible one-liners that strongly foreshadow Hitler's future actions, and I think these are probably what people took the most offence to. Personally I wish the rest of the series had been broadcast. It would have been particularly good if as the episodes went on Hitler became an increasingly violent, bigoted, unlikeable character and the show in general increasingly deviated from the American 50s sitcom archetype to become something even darker in a completely different way, the series finale ending in the Fuhrerbunker with Hitler and Braun's suicides. [According to Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heil_Honey_I%27m_Home), later episodes were supposed to involve a plot to murder the Jewish neighbours... What do you think?

I was sent to a charity to do my work placement, if I made it 6 months I'd be given a job there.  So I was told, although no paperwork ever appeared, no contracts signed... 

On the floor of building this charity had taken over worked: 'scum sucking bitch', 'primary patsy' and 6 New Dealers.  Our job was to help train immigrants to use computers, speak English and integrate with our culture.  I have training in only one of those but as I was simply the receptionist I didn't really care.

I was expected to arrive 'booted &amp; suited' which I did, then promptly told I needed to start throwing network cables around, crawl under desks and such (my CV had been sent they knew my exact skill set).  Basically I had to build the IT training room by hand, no uncrating machines from Dell we're talking assembling 50 machines from component parts, no pre-made patch leads... your average IT persons worst nightmare.  I should point out that booted and suited for my gender can often involve tights... 

On my second week I was dragged in to a meeting with the DWP people due to complaints about my attire, I needed to be presentable and apparently changing out of my suit and in to  combats with the pockets shoved full of screwdrivers, cable cutters and spare RJ45 plugs was a 'no no'.  I demanded expenses to cover dry cleaning as I was killing my suits and I also complained that I was getting letched at by a few of the other male New Dealers when I had gone under a desk in a skirt.

""Not my problem,"" came the call from the DWP, ""you're there to work.  We'll let it go this once but you need to improve.""  So I retired from being their IT bitch and returned to being the receptionist... in a suit as demanded (because I sure as shit aren't crawling around on the floor in a skirt).  You can guess what happened the following week right?  I wasn't pulling my weight and being helpful enough.  Didn't I want the job at the end of this?  Did I want my benefits cut?  Better buck up my ideas then eh?

Then I found the scam.  It wasn't charity it was charitIES all run by the same two people with 'primary patsy' on the documentation as director, but had no actual authority in the running of it.  No classes were ever given, no immigrants serviced.  But lots of money (about £2m per month) was being hoovered in to these peoples bank accounts. 

So I told the scum sucker to cut me in for £500p/m or face the consequences.  I was shortly removed from that charity placement and my benefits were nearly sanctioned in to oblivion until I showed them the local newspaper headline and copies of all the cooked books (thus I always warn people: do NOT fuck with me I really am that nasty).  I was removed from the New Deal at a rate that'd make the Scotty go 'bugger me that's fast' and left very much alone until I found employment (lasted 10 years).  Unfortunately 'primary patsy' was deported back to Mexico pitty, nice person (seriously, she was sweet... but very innocent).

Here's how the IT game works from an IT veteran:

IT jobs are on JobServe, CWJobs and JobSite. Recruiters exist as a bullshit filter between you and the employer, they are slimeballs who manipulate people all day long, skim CVs and reject 99% of people. You can't call them (they're always ""busy"") but if you have something they need they'll call you back. For each vacancy they have 5-10 people they can put forward and receive hundreds of CVs, you need to make sure they put you forward over other people.

One thing they aren't is technically competent, they're really looking for technical keywords on your CV that mean absolutely fucking nothing to them. If the job description says ""MS SQL Server"" and you have ""Microsoft SQL 2008"" on your CV you're shit out of luck because the recruiter doesn't even fucking know what Windows is let alone that MS means Microsoft or that SQL is a server.

So maintain a big list of the technologies you've worked with and work it into the description of your job in your CV. The more obscure the technology the better, because if you have something nobody else has and that's what the recruiters want then they will be the ones ringing you. Don't cruise through the work experience, use it to seek out tech you've never heard of and master it. Become an expert, suck domain knowledge from any experts you get the chance to work with and always do your homework.

You can be earning £100k in 5 years time if you get the right experience on your CV and can show you're an expert in an interview.

What we play is an awkward hybrid between a 4-2-3-1 and a 4-3-3 where the wingers don't track back and defend (like a 4-3-3), and the central players don't hold (like they should in a 4-2-3-1). As a result we get caught out all the time.

We seem awkwardly to be stuck halfway in attack as well. We play as if Mata is the nexus playmaker who slips the forwards in (like a 4-3-3), but our outside players stay deep and attack the inside (like a 4-2-3-1).

I agree that the 4-2-3-1 isn't the be all end all formation, however it is certainly still effective. If you need proof look at Madrid, Bayern, Germany, Spain, Man City (often), etc.

I don't really understand why this is such an unpopular statement to make. I'm just encouraging people to figure out what their beliefs and priorities are *before* they make decisions related to them. Don't become a martyr for something you don't believe in. Don't take a risk you know you don't want to take.

This poor kid knew the risks of taking cannabis and went for it. He wasn't a martyr he was a gambler, and he was a fool because it was only after losing his gamble that he realised he wasn't willing to take that risk. He killed himself which is an awful thing to happen and I feel for his family and friends, but if there's a message to take away from this it's that you shouldn't take risks that you aren't willing to lose.  
You only get one shot at life, you should make it mean something, you shouldn't spend your life on something you don't believe in. Edward Thornber wasted his life. He wasn't a martyr for a cause he believed in, he didn't die in the name of equality or freedom. He took his own life because he made a mistake that appeared so large that he didn't want to live any more. It's not clear from the story if he thought what he did should or shouldn't be legal, and it's not really important either because it's clear that he only hung himself because he couldn't deal with the consequences of being caught. At this point it hardly matters if he was caught smoking cannabis, kissing boys, raping sheep, reading the Qu'ran, or writing  Bob the Builder fanfiction. The tragedy here isn't that ""Some drugs are illegal and they shouldn't be"", the tragedy is that Edward Thornber made a choice that didn't reflect what his real beliefs and priorityies in life were and killed himself because he couldn't live with the mistake.

He's not a martyr. Stop comparing him to martyrs. He's just someone that made a big mistake.  
I'm not a bad person for pointing this out. I don't think alcohol should be illegal in Saudi Arabia, but I have no sympathy for tourists who knowingly take the risk and get caught. I don't think speeding is acceptable and I have no sympathy for boy racers who crash and kill themselves doing idiotic things on the road.

true,Mr_Wolfgang_Beard,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;I'm saying that there's far more pressure to social conformity today than (probably) at any time since the '50s.

That may or may not be the case, but AFAIK that could mean there's more pressure to avoid drugs or that could mean there's more pressure to take drugs. Depending on where you are in the country ""conforming to social norms"" might mean entirely opposite things when it comes to consuming drugs.

&gt;The reason for this is not the social sanctions which used to drive such conformity but the need to be ""employable"" in a corporate context, specifically at a time when the economy is hard

I don't quite follow how you've equated ""conforming to society"" with ""being employable"". I agree that everyone strives to be ""more employable"" these days, but that's normal in an environment where the population is growing faster than the economy, a few thousand years ago in times of famine everyone would strive to be ""better at hunting"", I don't think that you're describing anything unusual here.

&gt;and corporations expect much more control over people's non-working lives than they used to be able to command.

Downing has hit top form since Christmas, if he continues the season the way he has been playing I think it would be a mistake to sell him.  I actually think the example of Downing has strengthened my faith in Rodger's man management a little.  He kind of publicly called him out before Christmas saying he was free to leave in the summer, Downing reacted with thinly veiled anger but admitted it really motivated him.  Since that interview his form has been getting even better/more consistent.

Carroll isn't really worth anywhere near what we paid for him, we simply just need to get him off the books and accept him as the massive loss he has been for us rather than continue to pay a percentage of his wage.

Unless I misunderstood, that £50mil is a crazy amount to expect from Downing and Carroll. 

Suarez on the other hand... Losing him would set us back massively.  Even if we got £85mil it would still be a death sentence IMO because there is no way we can attract a forward half as good as Suarez at the moment and we will get absolutely played by selling clubs when we show up with a bulging wallet.  As TAW said on Friday's CityTalk, Suarez is by a massive distance the best player not playing in the Champions League.  His endless stamina and seemingly unlimited creativity makes up for a massive lack of squad depth and makes every player around him look so much better.

This then affects the level of physicality we can display on the pitch. With a lot of our players looking to save energy for a counter, they are not effectively covering, moving round the pitch to block gaps and I have failed to see us press like teams such as City, Tottenham and Arsenal do.

We are also displacing too many passes in an attempt for glory balls. 

Our intricate passing only really happens on the wings where it is slowed down heinously by Hazard and Mata interplaying, not because they are shit, but because other teams press us, and the players can't move fast enough to provide viable attacking options in space. 

This generally leads us being over committed also, leaving us weak on the counter. Which would be fine, if our centre backs weren't tired and slow and unable to deal with it. 

If we are going to play like this, we need to stop pushing both wing backs up each time and have someone with pace to cover. But then again, Cole has slowed significantly and Azpi is often interchanged for Ivanovic who has the speed of a centre back. 

When you watch teams such as Real, Barca and other top teams in Europe, only one wing back goes up and one stays behind to provide balance and protect against the counter.

Our back four obviously has the footballing ability to play as barca does and do well. Just takes time for center backs and the rest of the team to adjust when in high pressure situations.

At the end of the day the football field is a huge area with a lot of space to cover. You can easily pass it between two center backs and keeper which can cover the width of a football pitch (as barca does). To REALLY put pressure on you, a team has to commit 3 players, and that says nothing about winning the ball, just pressure. To win a ball in that amount of space where the three players are spread width of the pitch is insanely difficult if the three players involved (2 center backs and keeper) don't make a mistake.

true,sipos0,uk,London,"&gt; If there are people who are unemployable at the minimum wage then there's a surplus of hands and a shortage of jobs.

I don't think this is the case. If you look it at from a purely supply and demand point of view like this, there should never be vacancies for minimum wage jobs for unskilled minimum wage jobs while there are unskilled jobs at higher wages. 

I think people can be so unskilled that they aren't employable at any wage. If for example, someone was so unreliable that they couldn't be relied upon to turn up to their shifts most of the time, it wouldn't be worth employing them even if you have a position that is viable at the minimum wage. I think this is often the perception, if not the reality, that employers have of people who have been unemployed for a long time. 

Unemployment benefit does exist for a reason. There is an unavoidable period once you are laid-off from one job before you find a new one. It is there to cover that. It was never intended that people be long term unemployed. 

I agree that the minimum wage exists for a reason and, that people should not have to work for less than that but, I don't see any reason why it should be more than unemployment benefit. The point is that there is a minimum amount you need to have to live a decent life. People should not be on less than that just because they can't find a job. The problem is that, given the choice of working or, not working, people will choose not working so, if you don't put people to work like the government is trying to do when they are on job seeker's allowance, they will just not work if job seeker's allowance is the same as the minimum wage. It is also the case that some people will choose not work even if they are getting less than the minimum wage on benefits. I think this is partly the reason that the government wants to bring this in - to deter people from simply choosing not to work for less money. 

It seems to me that the best way to design support for unemployed people is, for the government to pay anyone not in a job, the minimum wage (which should be at least as high as the minimum wage now). In exchange they should be able to ask people who have been unemployed for longer than a certain amount of time to work in any job for no extra pay. They could either get people who are otherwise unemployed to do unskilled work for the council that improves things for everyone but, is otherwise not worth paying someone above the minimum wage for or, they could ask people to work in positions in the private sector for no extra pay in exchange for the private sector employer paying the government something (that would be up to a maximum of the minimum wage/unemployment benefit). People who are unable to work through disability should be paid at least the same too. It isn't fair that people get less than someone working in an unskilled job because they are disabled.

Well, they're no longer required, because that job is now being done by the unemployed for free.

true,sipos0,uk,London,"I agree that using people like this to cover shifts that other people won't isn't fair. Employers taking people on on something like this shouldn't be allowed to dictate someone's hours outside of normal working hours so, nobody should have to do night, weekend shifts or, shifts on public holidays on this scheme. If they can't fill those shifts, they need to pay people more to do them. Trying to get away with paying people minimum wage to work undesirable shifts isn't on and, using people who can't refuse to work on them for even less is just exploitative. 

I agree that saying that you need to be experienced to do shelf stacking is complete crap. I think I can see the reason employers do it though. I think it is because experience proves that you can work properly and are basically reliable and, some people aren't able or willing to do that. I worked in a small shop (it was a large newsagent/general shop). I was 17 or 18 and on minimum wage so, I was getting less than some people do on minimum wage (or, at least did then). I didn't like this job particularly (it was extremely tedious and, there was a lot of complaining because the shop delivered newspapers but, often, the paper-boys wouldn't deliver them or, wouldn't turn up so, every morning there'd be angry people complaining about the lack of a paper they'd paid to have delivered), clearly I was only in it for the cash but, I think I did a decent job. I did everything that was asked of me as well as I was able and, I was always there when I was supposed to be. That wasn't the case with everyone. Some of my colleagues really took the piss, not turning up for work when they were supposed to (sometimes when they were supposed to be the only person in apart from the manager so he had to man the till), doing no work at all if they could get away with it (for example, just standing around or hiding from the manager all the time when they were supposed to be re-stocking shelves so, he could never leave them alone doing it if he wanted them to actually do anything etc). Not everyone was like this but, one or two people were. I think that employers refuse to employ people who haven't been working for a decent amount of time in another job because they are afraid of getting someone like this, who is worse than nobody at all. You can't sack them (or at least you can't for ages) and, they cost more to supervise than they do work. 

I think the hours thing is probably a minimum. I think if you took a 12 hour a week job for Sainsburys and weren't like this, you'd be getting more than 12 hours a week soon (or, at the very least, the option of more if you are willing to work less desirable shifts - these being possible at minimum wage is a problem and, that shouldn't be an issue). Again, in the same job as above, I was only contracted for a small number of hours (8 a week I think?) but, I always worked more than that. Infact I ended up working 8 a day after a week or so. I think it is another protection employers take against hiring someone who won't work. If they hire someone for 12 hours, I think they basically (there may be lee-way) need to give them at least those hours so, they are in trouble if they employ someone who does no work for many hours because they can't get rid of them and get someone else. I think they do it so they can have a way to get people to leave (not give them any more than their contractual minimum hours) without them having to make them redundant if the person is unsuitable in some way. 

A problem with the whole thing to me, is the issue of small numbers of hours in general. I guess that if you take a job working 12 hours a week, you loose some or all of your job seeker's allowance? If so, that makes it pretty pointless to do it. They should change the rules so that if you do part time work, you never get more than a proportional amount deducted from what you get for job seeker's allowance so, if you get a job doing only 12 hours a week, you never loose more than 12/40ths (assuming that 40 hours is a normal work week) of what you got before so, you are always better off. 

I also agree that £56 for 30+ hours work is crap. I think the benefits being given to someone who is unemployed need to be higher though and, if they were, it wouldn't be so unreasonable. There is a minimum that you need to live a decent life on and, I think that it is much more than this. 

As I said in another comment, I think that everyone should be in a job if they are in the job market (I appreciate that some people can't work because they are caring for their children or, because of disabilities etc). At the moment, people aren't in jobs through no fault of their own because of how the labour market and unemployment benefit work. I think the best solution would be that the government guarantees to pay everyone the minimum wage and, in exchange, after a certain period of being unemployed, people are required to work in any job that is chosen for them by a local employment office (with reasonable restrictions, you shouldn't have to work in a night shift job, at weekends, public holidays, longer than normal hours, or in any sort of bad or unpleasant conditions, these should all require employers to pay people more than the minimum wage to get them to do it and should all be optional). There are lots of things that could be done for the council that would be great if there was someone to do them but, which aren't economical at the minimum wage now. In this scheme, the council could tell the employment off what would be helpful but, that they can't afford anyone to do and, the employment office puts someone who is unemployed to work on it. There are all sorts of ways that the environment could be improved like litter being cleared up, we could have more plants around if there were people to tend to them, more time caring for people who need carers (elderly or disabled people) etc. In this scenario, the government would be able to ask people who are otherwise unemployed to do this with it effectively costing them nothing (because they would be paying them the same amount anyway). The government could also recoup money for the tax payer by having companies pay something (that is less than the minimum wage) for them to have jobs that they would benefit from being done but, for which they can't financially justify paying someone the minimum wage too, done by unemployed people too. 

This would mean that everyone who can work is employed doing something productive (either for a private company making some money that goes towards paying their benefit as effectively a subsidised normal worker or, for the council/government directly for the benefit of everyone) at at least the minimum wage. I think this should even cost less for the government because they get either some money back from someone working for a private company under this scheme to pay for part of their benefit or, they get someone to do a job that needs doing for the council/government that they would otherwise still have to pay people to do. There will still be some people who are basically just idle (like the people I was describing above) but, I don't think this is what most unemployed people are. These people can always be put into jobs that don't require much supervision though so, if they don't turn up on time or, they skive off, it doesn't hugely matter, there are plenty of things where anything they do do is better than nothing (litter picking is an obvious example).

As a very long time Liverpool fan, I feel the most optimistic since some time now. The club - owners, management, and team -  have a focus finally. We have not had this kind of directed focus at the club since the 80's.  

We finally have the trifecta that had been missing for more than 20 years:-
A manager who is confident about his blueprint for the team's style; ownership with a purpose; administration that has started to rebuild LFC's commercial framework.

Time, and patience is needed to restore our glory days ahead. Remember, Manchester United almost ceased to exist after the Munich air disaster.

I worked in a shop and, there were people who wouldn't turn up for their shifts and would do nothing unless there was someone standing behind them checking they were doing it. It is clearly a complete waste of money employing people like that and the manager was trying to get rid of people like that but, once you have employed them, it's hard to get rid of them and, if someone quits, you need to employ someone fast to replace them. I think that if you have a scheme like this and someone proves they aren't like this during a short (I think 3 months that someone mentioned is too long) period then, that could help the employer because they know the person isn't going to be a liability like this. 

I agree that there could be a problem with companies laying off all of their staff and getting them back for free. I don't think companies should really be able to do this if they aren't employing people at the end of it.

Reina is a keeper capable of winning a game. 
Johnson is a right back capable of winning a game. 
Lucas is a holding mid capable of winning a game. 
Gerrard is a footballing legend capable of winning everything. 
Suarez is capable of winning a game. 

You probably need about 5 or 6 guys like that on form at the same time to get a result against a difficult opponent, and we have rarely had that luxury.  

Reina was out of form for a long time (looks to be back thank Robbie Fowler)

Lucas was hurt

That left JOhnson, Suarez and Gerrard and on their own they just often weren't enough to produce 3 points.  

Now that Sturridge has been added and Lucas/Reina are seemingly getting back, and Hendo is stepping up (as is Downing to an extent) we're starting to put it together and when you have 8-9 go to guys you're more likely to have 5 put in the performance necessary to win a game.

You will have to take some insults on the chin but i assure you you'll have an easier time as an American in Britain than a Brit in America. Just have a sense of humour and you'll make a tonne of friends. Accents tend to attract people :)  

I should mention alcohol consumption. We go to uni and become of drinking age at the same time in the UK so you will see some extraordinary drinking! My university experience included the weekly ""platinum week challenge"", where we try to get blind drunk every night and make every class. So i hope you enjoy your alcohol, your flatmates will. OH also in my experience, Americans go to night clubs to dance. We do not. We go to nightclubs to get drunk and dancing sort of ensues cause it seems like a good idea at the time.  

Now for the most important difference between American and British Unis, honestly, this difference should be the deciding factor for you.
My understanding is that in America you get Majors and minors in different subjects and slowly over the course of your degree you focus in on a career. I have friends who started off as engineers and become psychologist majors over time. You will not have this freedom in the UK. You wont get to pick and choose after your accepted. You sign onto a course and you focus on nothing else for the next 3/4 years. 

Both systems have advantages and disadvantages. If your not sure what you want to do but you think you might have an interest in say.... science, but you dont know if physics, biology or chemistry is right for you, then maybe you should stay in America. The system gives a lot of freedom and a wide breadth of knowledge in different areas. However, if you are passionate about a subject and you know you will want to do it as a career then Britain will be better for you. Our specificity allows us to teach the subject in a much greater depth. As a Brit living in America i feel that my focused education has given me a greater depth of knowledge when you compare me to Americans my age in the same subject.

With Inter, that was the case as well, but in Italy its easy to assume why. Tactically they are the best league in the world and so Mou's tactics weren't so new there...just executed to such a perfect extent.

What probably make a key difference is the *Mittelstand*.

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"&gt;You'd like me to list all the potential dodgy aspects of religious instruction?

I'd you to list the dangerous effects of a hymn or prayer being said in a school assembly. State schools do not have 'religious instruction'; they are not Madrasas. They sing a christian song or christian-related hymn in assembly, maybe a couple of times a week. 

&gt; It's not - none of it, I believe, is compulsory 

hmm I can't find a clear answer on this. apparently parents can opt-out their kids, but I don't see whether schools have to teach it or not. As anecdotal evidence, I went to a very christian CofE school, and got both barrels on sex ed. 

&gt;  In reality it's going to amount to little more than choosing different songs and not saying particular words, or included non-religious opinions/ideas.

so you don't have a problem with religious opinions being expressed, as long as others are too? won't other opinions be expressed in the form of not-mentioning-god, which will likely happen often (in my experience)? 

&gt; The majority, you say? Great! Point 6: "" ""There should be daily prayers in state schools"". Only 24% agreed with the statement while 62% disagreed with it."" 

oh great, a red herring. 'daily' prayers? is that the same as daily worship? no, it's not. nice source btw. 

&gt; If you're happy for majority rule then, depending on which survey you believe, we can do away with various religious influences

except the majority, whilst not religious, are obviously happy for their kids to be brought up in a broadly christian environment. If they weren't, they would all be opting out. 

&gt; Citation, if you please. Surveys I know of show something different. But don't you find it strange that even though people ""have no problem"", they still don't take the time to go to church etc.? A bit odd imo.

not at all. also your survey has 41% and 43% respectively, on two very leading questions. Is that a majority? as far as I know that would be a minority supporting changes. 

&gt; Hardly, though in that case it is a specific wish of the parent/guardian/child to attend a religious observance. 

yes, so you could still have a situation where everyone is going to a religious assembly, and the few kids with Dawkins-loving parents are sat in a separate assembly learning about atheism.

because most parents don't care that you sing a hymn or someone gives some moral instruction based on the bible. parents are obviously not up in arms about it. 

&gt; Disruption isn't welcomed at schools.

right, so what's your point? stop all assemblys because little Jonny's dad doesn't want him to hear a hymn about Jesus. Teachers will do it if they have to, and obviously they are required by law to do so.

which has nothing to do with the assembly issue. Most parents are fine with it, even if they're not practicing christians. do you know there are churches other than the CofE, too? 

&gt; And again: Nope. Unless you're counting census Christians?

yup. their specific beliefs don't matter, because assemblys don't exactly get into complex theology. they sing a happy song, clap hands, and get told to be nice to one another like the good samaritan was. 

&gt; Imagine I'm saying this loudly: Because there will be kids in any school that are not from religious families and/or do not identify as religious.

...who can opt out. what's the problem?

&gt; You can keep saying it, but it won't make it so.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20675307

&gt; You cannot expect every kid to be instructed in Christianity because you are a Christian.

I don't, and they are not. you seem to think assemblys include alter calls and baptisms. they sing a song and get a moral lesson or something. 

&gt; Again: most schools ignore much of the assembly law and I've heard it claimed numerous times that CoE faith schools ""don't really have that much Jesus about them"".

exactly. so whats the problem? 

&gt; State. Funded. Faith. Schools.

no one forces a kid to go to a faith school. have you heard about these things called parents? 

&gt; And every single little thing I've said about kids being isolated.

which would happen even with an opt-in system. 

&gt;  And you realise that there are religious people - Christians - who recognise and understand this problem/unfairness?

sure. do you realise there are non-religious people - atheists - who don't see a problem? 

&gt; Yet you of the firm conviction that there isn't an issue surrounding religion in school/faith schools? 

there is an issue amongst atheist/skeptic/secular society members, not in the general public. ",0,1361784148,null,0,false,0,c8l9ra6,t3_190oaa,t1_c8l9ra6,t1_c8kvp27,null,1431403606,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Property has been the best possible investment over the last 30 years, vastly outstripping any other investment you could have made.

I have no problem with profit, but if it is society that is supply the profit, then everyone should get a cut. That would be done in the form of land value taxes.

What do I care anyway?  I own my own house and benefit immensely from the foolish unwillingness to tax land values.

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"Because the landlord (and all land owners) obtain unearned gains from the general improvement of the area around them.

Imagine this: you own some land in the middle of nowhere.  You paid very little for it (£5000 an acre for pasture I think in the UK).  Now you gain planning permission.  You build nothing on it.  Is that land (now with planning permission) worth more or less than the £5,000 you paid?

Go again: imagine you build a house on your middle-of-nowhere land; say that costs you £100,000.  Five years pass and it is announced that a train station is being built within one mile of your house.   Is your land now worth more or less than the £105,000 you put into it?  The answer is, of course, more.  If it happens to be on a line to London, then the answer is _much_ more.

Now imagine the train station attracts enough other developers to build houses, and some village shops, etc, etc.  Is your property worth more or less?  All those increases were not due to any wise investment or even action on your part; they were due to the general improvement (thanks to society at large) of the location surrounding your property.

Now you rent out your property.  Rent is merely a reflection of current value; and hence you, as the landlord are able to ask far more for the property than any investment you put into justifies.

If they're on a big project they might not be up for letting work exp student work on it, but they'll let you watch and talk to guys who are, so good networking skills there. So ask for work experience, unpaid internship or a runner placement.

Soho in london is good for production companies, though Bristol seemed to have good amount too. Recall i think framestore had good work experience program.

Some people are on Linked in, so maybe send messges on there after searching for the right people.

AFAIK, Funnel webs are the only *super* dangerous ones. Red backs and white tails just make you ill. Huntsman are harmless and they intimidate the more dangerous ones so they're good to have about.

I've been here 6 months so far and I've seen about 15 white tails and 10 huntsman. When you encounter a dangerous one (not huntsman) it makes my heart skip a beat, but then you realise its just doing its thing and as long as you don't tits about round them they aren't arsed by you.

Snakes, on the other hand, are fucking super dangerous. I've only see one in the Bush in NSW and it was a brown snake which I'm told is a dangerous one. Thankfully we ran it over and somehow it survived and slithered into the verge across the road.

The thing about snakes is that, although they are territorial, they are really scared of humans so if you're making a ton of noise, or in a low area, they're unlikely to be there and will flee to a safe spot. They are also *rapid as fuck* so out running them isn't an option aha.

I was lucky enough to be able to cope without it for a short time to be able to do that placement.

AFAIK basically none of the Game Devs take on interns, and if they did I'm certain you'd need to know somebody on the inside to be in with a shot of getting it. So here's the big reality check incoming - you're going to have to widen your horizons and try to get work in other industries and not necessarily in animation.

The fact of the matter is that just having an internship sets you apart from the crowd, and it doesn't matter if it was entirely relevant to the kind of job you want to get afterwards - the internship shows that you can get dressed and go to work in an office like an adult, the degree shows you're qualified to do what you want to do. As mentioned, my internship was in systems administration, but I still got hired as a programmer the week I graduated. The nice thing was that that experience also made me qualified for a wider variety of roles than I would have been otherwise, whilst still making me much more employable compared to my peers (many of whom took months to find a job, and a few of which couldn't get anything in computing at all).

My advice is to look for the internship schemes at the massive tech companies, and other large organisations because they're the most likely to take on interns. Unless things have changed, the following take interns:

* Microsoft
* Oracle
* Google
* Apple
* BAE
* Lockheed Martin
* NHS
* HM Gov (various departments, everything from records up to GCHQ)
* Oil Companies. Plenty of them in the UK. I don't know any in particular that take on comp sci people but I'm sure some of them must, and they do use animation and modeling for simulations.

If you want to stick to the design side of things, try to get into a web development scheme. If you want to get more technical, sys admin is great (you mostly sit on your arse all day waiting for things to break and getting paid, perfect for a student :P ). I'd say avoid tech support like the plague, it's soul crushing and everyone and his dog has worked front line at some point, so it won't look as good on your CV. Not as good as ""I administered several million dollars worth of equipment for a multi national corporation"" anyway :)

Best of luck. And although I have maybe sounded a big of a negative nancy, don't give up! When I got taken on-board for an internship it was for a company that I thought I had no way in hell of ever working for, I had just sent in my CV on the off chance!

Play Ross more next year or get someone who is like Leroy Fer, a CM who'll bring the ball forward with pace and can play a decent pass like Arteta did when he first arrived.

Regarding travel passes: as a visitor to the country, it might be worth checking out [BritRail passes](http://www.visitbritainshop.com/australia/travel-transport/rail-tickets.html) - they're only available to non-UK citizens, and give you unlimited train travel for a certain number of days within a set period, which can save you a lot of money if you do any spontaneous trips (train travel can be very cheap if you book ahead, but quite expensive if you're buying tickets on the day). Check out [Red Spotted Hanky](http://www.redspottedhanky.com/) for prices on trains to places you'd like to visit, and see whether a railpass would be a good option for you. The passes are mailed to you, so if you get one be sure to allow enough time for it to arrive before you go.

Regarding tours: I took a day trip to Loch Ness with [Rabbies](http://www.rabbies.com/edinburgh_tour_departures.asp) last September, and it was pretty good. The bus was small (only 16 seats) and the driver was fantastic - giving fascinating commentary along the way. We stopped at some really interesting spots on the way there and back - the route is a big circle, so you see different areas on the way out and back.

Outside Edinburgh: If you like castles, I'd recommend taking a daytrip to Stirling, and if you're a Monty Python fan make sure to pop over to Doune and check out the castle there ;) For pure sightseeing, the West Highland Line rail journey from Edinburgh/Glasgow to Mallaig is absolutely spectacular.

Accommodation-wise: have a look at [University Rooms](http://www.universityrooms.co.uk) for budget rooms - it lists uni accommodation that is available to the public either year-round or during uni holidays, the rooms are very affordable, and tend to have excellent public transport links. There's also their [Bed &amp; Breakfast site](http://www.edinburghbedbreakfast.co.uk/) that is worth a look.

true,mikeanthony80,null,null,"I agree with pretty much all you said, but the way Madrid (and by extension all Mourinho's past teams) play any formation has the wingers tracking back. For some reason his players tend to listen to him unlike Benitez! If we had Mourinho, Mata, Hazard et al would actually come back and defend sometimes I expect. The same goes for Germany and Bayern. However Spain play something very different indeed. Bousquets essentially plays as a third centre back, a system Man City tried out at the beginning of the season with pretty disastrous consequences. From there you can see why 3 at the back is making a comeback.

Juventus play a great system with 3 at the back. Their wing backs push on, but when they need to defend they become 5 at the back, which is very hard to break down. I'm not sure if Mourinho would employ that system if he came to us, but if Conte came (my personal choice at the moment), I could see us transitioning to something quite exciting like that. I just don't see Benitez doing anything remotely new, exciting or radical. 

I know I went off topic a bit there, but if next year we brought a new manager in who had REALLY new ideas, like 3 at the back, I would be all over that. AVB had some new ideas, and I still like him. He's doing a good job at Tottenham. He's clearly a pretty good manager, and if they win tonight they'll be above us. Ughh. But he essentially played 433 with a higher back line. Let's hope whoever comes in next season has some new ideas, but more importantly (and unlike AVB) has the backing of the players.

The landlord market dies as they invest funds elsewhere, not taxed at 50%.

So - we are left with Banks holding properties and FTBers wanting them.

The more property the bank holds, the less value the assets become. With every sale they make to FTB'ers at this lower price (yes lower demand and increase supply deceases value) they realize their losses. So confidence in banks are gone as they are now losses on every sale. The property market confidence is gone which results in banks funding dries up.

Where are FTB'ers going to get funds to purchase these properties?
They may benefit from lower values, but banks are not going to loose large amounts of cash, so the prices will remain artificially high. 

In addition FTB'ers will need a large deposit as ""loan to value"" drop as confidence in property is gone and banks don't have funds to do so.

The truth is they wont, so Social Landlords may purchase the properties (are they too taxed at 20% not sure).

true,beard-maketh-the-man,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;An independent Scotland will be able to keep the pound, the UK government will argue next month — but only if Scottish ministers accept budget constraints set by London.

&gt;In a paper published in early March, the coalition will back down from its previous resistance to the idea of sharing the pound as advocated by Alex Salmond, the SNP leader. But in a position likely to trigger a big row with the Scottish government, George Osborne, the chancellor, will say such a currency union would require ministers in Holyrood to accept a deﬁcit cap, to be policed from London.

&gt;The argument will form the crux of the next and most controversial in a line of government analysis papers on how an independent Scotland could function. British ministers know they are likely to prompt a big battle between London and Edinburgh, but are keen to force the SNP to join a debate about the consequences of a vote for independence.

&gt;One senior coalition ofﬁcial told the Financial Times: “This is different from a straight transition from sterling to sterling, there would be a negotiated settlement.

&gt;“It very much suits the Scottish govermnent to have a simplistic set of messages saying we will have sterling and the queen and anything else not to frighten the horses. But as soon as you look at it in any detail, it doesn’t work.”

&gt;The British government’s new argument marks something of a u-turn for Mr Osborne. He has previously argued that sharing a currency would require some form of ﬁscal integration between the two countries, but that he could not think of a mechanism that would make that work.

&gt;The chancellor told the CBI last September: “It’s difﬁcult to argue for establishing a monetary union while pursuing ﬁscal and political separation . . . I have seen no such credible mechanisms proposed by those advocating independence. I am not clear they exist.”

&gt;British ofﬁcials have long argued that allowing an independent Scotland complete control over its own budget could undermine a joint currency if a Scottish government decided to run unsustainable deﬁcits and allowed debt to rise. They now believe that a deﬁcit cap policed strictly by the Bank of England could eliminate that problem.

&gt;The coalition’s new argument will put Mr Salmond in a difﬁcult position. The Scottish ﬁrst minister abandoned his party’s longstanding support for joining the euro as the eurozone crisis unfolded, and has since then insisted an independent Scotland could retain sterling.

&gt;Coalition ofﬁcials say he will now be forced to choose between reversing his commitment to the pound and accepting an independent Scotland could not have full control of its budget.

&gt;They point to comments made by John Kay, a former adviser to Mr Salmond and Financial Times columnist, who said last year that a separate Scottish currency was necessary for full control over tax and spending.

&gt;Tensions between London and Edinburgh are not likely to end there. In its next analysis paper, the British government will argue that an independent Scotland could not undergo a repeat of the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis without risking complete collapse.

&gt;The coalition will argue that the country’s ﬁnancial services sector is so big that a separate Scottish government would not be able to afford to bail it out. Ministers will point out that when the UK govermnent nationalised RBS in 2008, its balance sheet exceeded £2.2 trillion, 50 per bigger than the entire British economy.

&gt;The SNP will release its own analysis later this year into how it envisages Scotland would operate if voters choose independence in next year’s referendum. The party currently faces an uphill battle to secure a “yes” vote. The latest polls suggest 32 per cent of Scots back independence, while 47 per cent would prefer to remain in the union.

&gt;However, that leaves 20 per cent of the electorate undecided, giving Mr Salmond scope to believe he may yet repeat his shock victory in the 2011 Holyrood elections, where he deﬁed all expectations to win an SNP majority government.",0,1361799239,null,0,false,0,c8lbf8b,t3_196m67,t1_c8lbf8b,t1_c8la8q6,null,1435579141,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

I'm not sure what grounds you're objecting to this on other than perhaps that you perceive my criticism as racially aggravated or something similar.

I have lecturers who can not form a basic sentence in an unambiguous manner, who can't pronounce simple every day words, who, essentially, it's a waste of time to go to the lectures of, because their message is lost in the mess of their language.

Perhaps turn the question around, why isn't there support for better cycling lanes (not just paint slopped on the road, but proper joined up and safe infrastructure) when there are so many deaths and injuries each year from motorists who clog cities and towns across the UK every day, twice a day?

&gt;Legal tender has a very narrow and technical meaning in the settlement of debts. It means that a debtor cannot successfully be sued for non-payment if he pays into court in legal tender. It does not mean that any ordinary transaction has to take place in legal tender or only within the amount denominated by the legislation. Both parties are free to agree to accept any form of payment whether legal tender or otherwise according to their wishes. In order to comply with the very strict rules governing an actual legal tender it is necessary, for example, actually to offer the exact amount due because no change can be demanded.

&gt;The amounts for legal tender are stated below.

&gt;BANK OF ENGLAND NOTES:

&gt;In England and Wales the £5, £10, £20 and £50 notes are legal tender for payment of any amount. However, they are not legal tender in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

&gt;COINS:

&gt;Coins are legal tender throughout the United Kingdom for the following amount:

&gt;£5 (Crown) - for any amount  
£2 - for any amount  
£1 - for any amount  
50p - for any amount not exceeding £10  
25p (Crown) - for any amount not exceeding £10  
20p - for any amount not exceeding £10  
10p - for any amount not exceeding £5  
5p - for any amount not exceeding £5  
2p - for any amount not exceeding 20p  
1p - for any amount not exceeding 20p

Basically, legal tender is specifically payment (//e)*when sued for non-payment*(//e) for a *non-returnable* service, i.e., a hair cut, and only when presented **without the possibility of returning change**. It's also only done with Bank of England issued coins and notes.

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; If you are a new member state, you have to make preparations to adopt the Euro as your main currency, however an existing state doesn't.

The treaty of Maastricht requires joining the Euro, however that obligation is not immediate. Sweden are technically obliged to join the Eurozone but they have essentially deferred it indefinitely. Their argument is that adopting the Euro also requires signing up for ERM II, and that membership of this is voluntary.

So far there is no great pressure on Sweden to change this stance, and given Scotland's historical membership as part of the UK it seems fairly likely that a similar situation would be tolerated in the short term.

&gt; The UK government in Westminster, the Unionist movement, The EU themselves including both the EU presidents and other EU institutions and other EU countries such as France, Germany and Spain all say that Scotland would be a new member state and would have to start from ground 0 as a completely new country negotiating membership to join the EU, and therefore would be required to adopt the Euro.

This is quite a long sentence, but does contain some inaccuracies. E.g., by the ""EU themselves"" I presume you mean the European Commission? They have expressly not stated an official opinion on Scotland's membership - they have offered to do so if requested by the one legal entity they can recognise (the UK), however Westminster are explicitly refusing to ask.

Several officials from the EC have expressed an opinion one way or the other, however those are their personal opinions and they do differ.

&gt; Of course just to muddy the debate further Spain have already said that it will also Veto any joining of the EU by a new independent Scotland because they don't want Catalonia (Barcelona) to get any confidence about becoming an independent state too. This alone could bog down negotiations to Turkey vs Greece style levels for several years.

Actually, Spain have stated that they would have no objection to a negotiated settlement between rUK and Scotland.

Their issue with Catalonia is over unilateral secession, and stems from the Spanish constitution expressly referring to the ""indivisible unity of the Spanish state"".

Owning land can give income in many ways without dying:

1. You can charge others rent for houses you own.
2. If you own your house you don't have to pay rent. Mortgage payments eventually stop, but rent doesn't. And in many cases mortgage payments are lower than rent.
3. You can sit on non-residential land until you eventually get planning permission to build houses on it, then rake in your fortune.
4. You can lease the land if you don't live on it.

Even now this planet makes more than enough food to feed everyone.  Yet in western countries so much food gets thrown away and wasted. It just seems absurd how we are willing to believe in this economic system which allows this to happen.

The vertical farming idea is really good and I think in Singapore the go ahead has been giving to start implementing this ( cant think off the top of my head, I think it was some sort of 'eco-building') And its not like permaculture as an idea would be against this at all.  I was just looking at the disadvantages and a fusion of techniques could be an answer. 

 But for me personally I feel that unless we change  some fundamental beliefs in how things are distributed and how we view ourselves within a planetary system. vertical farming, if it comes about within the economics of the current agricultural industry, doesn't really answer the core issues but has a few solutions that will give rise to new unforeseen problems. 

When the permaculturist say 'we cant save everyone' the point they are trying to make is that yes we can improve how we feed everyone. Currently we a exhausting the soil and land available but once everyone is fed. How do we then deal with the other qualities in their lives?  90% of the  world population wants to live like a reasonably well off American, given the chance. Never thinking about the food on the supermarket shelves; the clean water that flows cheaply (at the moment) from the taps; all the little technological gadgets that we use in our leisure; all the masses of energy that it takes to keep that lifestyle going, which leeds on to the last point: Oil

Without the power that the black gold has given us over the last 130 years. We would be struggling to feed 2 billion let alone 7 or the projected 9 billion that will be alive in 40 years time.  It is easy to forget how instrumental oil is within farming.  We cant get fertilizer from wind,wave and solar power...atm

true,timbstoke,null,null,"These are minimum wage, unskilled jobs, which are traditionally quite high turnover. Therefore many people won't have been employed for the 2 years required to claim unfair dismissal.

The actual information regarding the MWA (Mandatory Work Activity) is at http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/122754/response/298962/attach/html/3/MWA%20guidance%2023.07.12.pdf.html, and reads:

&gt; A JSA claimant potentially suitable for MWA is one identified through the 
work targeted interview process, supported by use of the Customer 
Assessment Tool, as lacking ,or failing to demonstrate, the focus and 
discipline that is necessary to effectively: 

&gt; *  seek out and pursue job opportunities 

&gt; *   secure and retain employment 

However, MWA is not the only scheme. By far the largest is the Work Experience Scheme, which ""is targeted at 16-24 year olds, especially those who have not worked before and have no or low qualifications."" (http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN06249). 16-24 year olds with no or low qualifications are EXACTLY the target audience for entry level retail jobs. 

I will grant you that this scheme is voluntary, but many claimants are not told this, and are led to believe that their benefits will be cut if they do not take part. So I will concede that ""forced"" may be the wrong word, but they are certainly being 'coerced' into doing a job for free that somebody should be getting paid for. 

As far as evidence...well, quite evidently Argos and friends aren't going to have people being paid to sit in the break room because the free labour pool is doing their work for them. If you accept that they are doing actual work that someone else would have to do if they weren't there, then you have to accept that that work is being taken away from a paid employee. The OP admits that the Argos he works in only employed part time staff and all the full time staff are on workfare. While it's possible that they never employed full time shelf stackers, I find it very unlikely.

If that was true, the wouldn't be hundreds of thousands of pedestrian / motor vehicle accidents and thousands of deaths each year. . . . while the pedestrian / cycle death rate over the last decade remains in two figures.

* During the same year, there were 13,272 recorded collisions between cars and bicycles, resulting in the deaths of 52 cyclists and no car drivers or passengers

Regardless, better cycling facilities will only produce positive results.  A safer environment for both cyclists and pedestrians.  A fitter and healthy nation of people, less pollutions in our towns and cities and a reduction in deaths of both pedestrians and other road users.

It's unfortunately difficult to plan protests that directly target those responsible for that being protested.

Mass protests have always generated some animosity, such as yours, and yet have often ultimately been successful in achieving their aims.

You never, ever, throw it in reverse on every level that's a bad move.  Take every field in the UK and stack them vertically, build more of those buildings.  Food is now so plentiful that even when one vertical farm shuts down for maintenance their is so much slack in the system nobody notices.

You pump outside air in and they can double as secondary atmospheric processors to clean the air up (whilst buildings full of certain strains of GE'd alge do the heavy work), the now vacant farm land can be left to go fallow, repair and regenerate and overtime forests replanted. 

But why invest in ALL sciences?  You're going to need nuclear physicists and lots of them as well as engineers ready to design and build a fusion reactor once the physicists get it working.

&gt; They had a placement at sainsburys to work the check out, admittedly they gave them a couple of afternoons training.
They proceeded to employ them for free for the next 6 months. Working longer than the hours originally appointed and was asked to cover as many shifts over christmas all in the fear of losing £56.80 a week. Its awful to make you hang on in hope for 6 months not knowing if youll ever get the job. While asking you to work overtime and on holidays while you cannot refuse them. Its bullshit, fantastic they have worked 30+ hours a week only to be given a £56. When they offered her the job it was less than 12 hours a week, its disgusting.

Here we have an example of actual employees losing out to workfare (asked to cover shifts of paid employees)

That's just from this thread. I'm sure if I had more time I could find more examples from the wider internet, but I'm sure you can start to see the point. Common sense dictates that if you've got somebody doing a job for nothing, that means that the people who would have had to do that job for a fair days wage are no longer required. 

I'm not against work experience as a concept - if this was targeting junior positions in more skilled roles that required actual training to be undertaken, such as a plumbers mate etc, then great. But by including unskilled labour such as warehouse work and shelf stacking, you're basically making thousands of entry level jobs unavailable, because it's cheaper for the company to use this scheme, take on just the minimum number of staff to meet the government requirements for participating, and then get rid of them after a short probationary period.

true,TJP343,null,null,"The tactical genius, Michael Cox, recapped the match on Zonal Marking. Interesting points that seem relevant to Spurs:

-Inter set out in a 4-4-2 shape and their centerbacks sat deep against Balotelli due to his pace but their centermids played higher up to challenge Milan's CM. This left space in the middle and was exploited by Boetang coming inside from a wide position to setup Milan's goal.

Spurs might be able to take advantage of this situation if Defoe is started and Holtby is in behind him. One of Inter's two CM would have to drop onto Holtby and that could leave Parker and Dembele in a 2v1 situation. Or, the Inter CMs press Parker and Dembele and Holtby is left with space in between the lines to exploit.

The biggest difference between Spurs and Milan's midfield three is Milan had Montolivo sitting deep and was picked up by an Inter forward. Spurs don't play in this way, they sit two deep and one more advanced mid(or they play with two strikers). AVB should be able to create a constant 3v2 situation in midfield if Inter set out in this way against Spurs.

-Inter allowed Milan's centerbacks time on the ball and space to push forward into midfield and Milan took advantage of this well in the first half.

Inter partially allowed the centerbacks to rush forward because one of their two strikers was dropping off onto Montolivo. Again, Spurs don't play with a single mid shielding the back four but if Inter stand off Vertonghen has certainly shown an ability to push forward on the ball. 

-As mentioned, Nagatomo was generally poor in defense and didn't receive much help from Guarin playing in front of him on Inter's right. Milan's left back was able to overlap fairly easily in the first half. This was corrected somewhat in the second half when Zanetti switched to the right.

Of course, Zanetti cannot play both FB positions at once so whichever flank he is covering the other could potentially be exploited by Spurs FBs pushing forward. Walker and BAE already do this anyways and could be a big threat. 

Also, Ricky was started in this match and has featured more in the Cups for Inter and when I have seen him play his tactical discipline is poor. When he's deployed out wide he routinely drifts inward when Inter have possession(like old friend, Rafael van der Vaart) and that leaves plenty of space on whichever flank he is supposed to be covering exposed.

If Inter set out in this way, Walker, Bale and Lennon should be able to cause all sorts of problems across both flanks against Inter, coupled with Spurs having the potential for 3v2 in midfield areas it becomes very easy to envision a clear victory for our boys in white.

However, Cassano's positioning is terrifyingly good. Always impressed with how well he drops into pockets of space across the whole pitch and receives long passes with an ability to quickly generate a counter attack. Seen Inter play a few times and when they get Cassano involved they are very dangerous on the counter and attacking in general. Very, very smart player.",0,1361809810,null,0,1361810197,0,c8ldprm,t3_195coc,t1_c8ldprm,t3_195coc,null,1431405419,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

There surely aren't enough skilled apprenticeships for people who have nowhere to start. The only people who are being forced into work placements are extreme cases who can't get a job anywhere at all and have been unemployed for several years [3].


&gt;Where were the paid staff who should have been there from 7am?

I'm going to say that the paid staff had the positions they did BECAUSE they were successful applicants for paid positions. These are people who have no experience and the sad truth is that to get that experience they might have to do jobs *temporarily* that are worse than they would otherwise.

I mean, I'm not saying it's right that this is the case but in the society we have what is the real alternative? 

We need a host of coordinated things to happen, skilled and unskilled job creation is a huge factor. But you also have to recognize that some scheme is needed to help raise the employment prospects of those who have no hope.

I want to be wrong on this but I just can't see a feasable alternative short term.

Also, growing up in an environment where many people don't work but get by none the less makes it an easy option for young adults.

Going back to your original question, the politics surrounding the closure of the mining industry make it a heated topic.

There is *nothing* stopping you from making as many self-posts as you want. Seriously, there's no refractory period. If you wanted you could make a dozen self-posts, all of them talking about the show.

If you want discussion, *make it*. Back on /r/Gallifrey I wrote an essay for every day of the week when people complained there was too much ""Moffat-hating"" content and not enough people showing love for the show. 

If you want discussion, don't try and berate people for not starting it for you. Nothing is stopping you from actually making these sorts of posts yourself.

Hell, if everyone in here who agrees with you just took the time it took to make a comment and thought up an interesting thought about Doctor Who there would be a *surplus* of self-posts and the very problem you're complaining about would be solved.

&gt; Exploiting a loophole in the Sunday trading legislation — certain provisions of the Shops Act, 1950 did not apply to ‘any sea-going ship’* — Liverpool-based Empirewise Ltd purchased the ship with plans to open a leisure and retail complex which would include a Sunday market. Having found a suitable location — a disused fishing dock on the banks of the River Dee at Llannerch-y-mor near Mostyn — her new owners then arranged for the ship to be transferred from Barrow. On her final voyage the ship was towed by two tugs from Bangor and arrived at her final resting place on 10 August 1979.

&gt; Soon afterwards serious concerns for her safety arose on account of the tidal conditions at the dock. The decision was therefore made to beach her. An old concrete barge from the Menai Strait was scuttled at her stern and then a makeshift dredger was used to pump sand around the hull so that she could securely rest on an even keel.

&gt; Bar licences were obtained but there were issues with the local council in obtaining full planning consent. Nevertheless, the ship opened to the public in 1980 as The Funship. The car deck provided space for 100 market stalls together with a cafe and bingo hall. There were also various other cafes, bars and restaurants on board as well as an amusement arcade, pool hall, and a children’s play area and cinema. Additionally, there were plans to convert the cabins into hotel accommodation.",0,1361810579,null,0,false,0,c8ldxm2,t3_196vr2,t1_c8ldxm2,t3_196vr2,null,1431405522,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

OP appears to have no problem with doing the work, simply wanting to be paid according to his effort. There are, however a  number of problems with sending jobseekers to the private sector for wok experience without more than their normal benefits - which are less than minimum wage, don't forget, for nearly everyone. One of these is that the jobseeker is doing work which would otherwise be done by a paid member of staff - and therefore is actually worsening the availability of paid jobs. 
You say ""if people don't want to do it, they can take a job unless nobody will employ them at minimum wage"" but this is only accurate if there is an appropriate job available. When we hear of jobs having hundreds of aplications for even the minimum wage - and I saw the [Guardian](http//:www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2013/feb/22/wanted-passion-coffee-job-costa?INTCMP=SRCH) talking about 4 figures for a pair of barista jobs before the weekend, is that a realistic option? You are right, however, that current students are getting a raw deal.  - tuition fees, loans, and all the associated baggage have been handled extremely badly. Surely, though, that is an argument to do better, rather than drag others down as well? Certainly, a backdoor subsidy to (in this case, Argos) seems a pretty poor option.
I would have more difficulty arguing against this were those ""volunteers"" directed to work that was to benefit the community, in the same way that community service is, although hopefully without the punishment aspect.

I certainly don't ride by my own rules, although I can see where you got that from because, now I re-read it, my comment sounds a lot more cavalier than I intended or, indeed, behave.

The ""set of rules"" thing is really more of an allowance: because a cyclist's safety is maintained by a combination of awareness, attention, anticipation, (a few other nouns) and safe driving and maybe I just don't trust most drivers on principle (I like to watch how and when people observe and indicate and by that, anticipate how safe it is to cycle anywhere near them).

If so much of a cyclist's safety relies on drivers I simply think there should be a few allowances. For example, sometimes it is much safer to go through a red light than to wait at it. Not often; but sometimes. Sometimes you'll be waiting beside someone clearly not paying attention - on their phone, no idea you're there - and you'd be much safer (providing the road ahead was clear of other drivers and pedestrians) to just go.

I understand this opens-up a lot of potential issues and could very easily be abused so it probably shouldn't ever become legal for a cyclist to run a red light on principle, however for a cyclist's safety I think it should be permissible to break certain rules that drivers cannot in cases where it would be safer.",0,1361811139,null,0,false,0,c8le3hp,t3_18vphy,t1_c8le3hp,t1_c8lcybt,null,1435579121,1,false,londoncycling,t5_2wcdj,1

Of course, those born in an industrial context can rarely see beyond industrial scale solutions—if there exists only a hammer, every problem will look like a nail—and going vertical would be one of those. It isn't available for every one and it would require monolithic construction to work and only relevant should you want to repurpose multistory car-parks perhaps should that technology even be choked of cheap oil (~10 years?). The sun only hits in one direction and tall buildings cas awfully long shadows.

&gt; low yield sustainable farming

This is incorrect. It's about having a high yield to energy input ratio that goes beyond sustainable but utilises regenerative practices. One of the fundamental principles is that no soil should be naked and unproductive. Take a look at the empty field of sludge behind the farmer atop of the Guardian article. You talked of verticality, and that too is a principle of permaculture: you have the canopy (trees), vines on the trees, lower shrubbery, then the ground layer. It doesn't seem like you have a particularly good understanding.

13% of the UK is actually urban, and we find the space for hundreds of golf courses.

true,Shillmuybienpagados,null,null,"Admittedly your ""opponent"" in this debate is being needlessly aggresive but they're asking what I think are pretty good questions about the building of additional cycle lanes and you are avoiding direct answers and just responding with ""something something Holland"" or ""provide evidence that people don't use cycle lanes"". 

The questions he is asking are *certainly* the questions that will be asked by authorities and planning departments and the people who have to set budgets for any additional cycling infrastructure and they *will* survey and take video and monitor existing use in mind numbing depth for an extended period of time, before making any decisions.
  
I think you're answers are quite telling in that you seem to be seriously stating that, in all your time cycling, it hasn't become apparent to you that a lot of cyclists don't use cycle lanes or stop at red lights or have any regard for road safety? To me that suggests either wilfull ignorance or that you're paying no attention to what's going on around you on the road, either of which enforces the argument against careful cycling.  And I'm aware that a lot of motorists have no idea how to use the road either (and they don't have the excuse of having no mandatory test to pass), but two wrongs do not make a right and ""well he does it too"" is not a reasoned argument from either side.

Emotive issues about who has how much ""right"" to be doing what on the roads aside; I do feel you're making a blanket claim that you're not backing up with any evidence and that I don't think you've studied any data sources that are not ardently pro-cyclist.

The current favoured cyclist argument about it ""working in Holland"" doesn't hold up to much scrutiny for the main and somewhat unsurprising reason that this is not Holland. 

Holland, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland started initiating sensible road use and HGV reduction policies in the 1970s and have been supported with a working, decent rail system that includes multiple ""freight only"" rail networks which significantly reduce the volume of HGV traffic on their roads which is a major factor in inclusion of cycling infrastructure. We clearly have neither of these things in place.

The arguments for it in the UK also wilfully overlook the question of ""where"" these cycle lanes will be built;  what space will be given up for cycle lanes? 

Personally I'd welcome major cycling infastructure but I'm a pragmatist at heart and I don't see it being adopted in the UK any time soon.",0,1361812601,null,0,1361814751,0,c8lej0u,t3_196qij,t1_c8lej0u,t1_c8lcvig,null,1431405803,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,timbstoke,null,null,"I agree, there aren't enough skilled roles for everyone to get a 'decent' apprenticeship. But the way it's being done right now is broken. 

For unskilled labour, there is no incentive for the employer to actually retain any of the people they 'train', because it will only take an hour to train the next person to the same standard. Even for someone who does an exceptional job during their work experience period, the choice the employer is faced with is ""Start paying someone minimum wage for doing a good job as an unskilled labourer"" or ""Get another unskilled labourer for free, and if they're only half as good, we can just get two of them."" 

Not only does it not encourage the employer to retain the staff, it jeapordises the jobs of the existing staff. No, I can't provide undisputable evidence of it happening, but if you have 10 staff working 40 hours a week at minimum wage, and you have the opportunity to drop that to 4 staff and 10 'apprentices', it simply makes good business sense. That in itself introduces a risk that existing jobs are being threatened by the scheme in its current incarnation. 

As for how you'd address that...well, I don't have all the answers to that. I can come up with a few suggestions, but not all of them will work well together, and I'm sure there are counter arguments to each of them: 

* Shift the payment of JSA from the government onto the employer. At least then they're not getting completely free labour funded by the taxpayer. 
* Increase the payment to the JSA worker. It could still be less than minimum wage, but it should be *something* above and beyond their JSA. 
* Require the employers to demonstrate that they are using the scheme to create jobs, and not simply as a cheap labour source. To me, that should be achieved by requiring the employer to make a position available in advance of any workers being made available to them, and provide evidence that the position was filled following completion of the scheme. 
* Require the employer to provide staff turnover statistics, to verify that employees aren't being 'let go' to make room for JSA workers. 
* Track statistics on all employees progressing through the scheme to ensure that employers aren't getting rid of employees hired through the scheme after a short period to create vacancies. 
* Impose legal maximum working hours on JSA workers, to ensure that employers cannot abuse the service to remove hours from paid staff. 
* Remove the threat of loss of benefits if the JSA worker leaves employment either voluntarily or because he was 'fired'. The current system is far too open to abuse by employers who are all too aware that workers who don't ""do as they're told"" will find themselves with no source of income at all. 

That's all I can come up with on the spot, but I'm sure there are other ways it could be improved to become something more resembling a workable solution. ",0,1361812817,null,0,false,0,c8lele2,t3_194v1l,t1_c8lele2,t1_c8ldr8p,null,1431405833,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The Dark Ages.  During that time it was the Arabic (and often Muslim) countries that kept the flame of science and knowledge burning and even today we use some of their discoveries and conventions in our daily lives.    Now look at those regions once science stopped being the main driver of the culture: they stagnated and fell.

The answer to any of these problem is: accelerate scientific endeavours and discoveries. 

You seem fixated on hydrocarbon derived energy production, yet I've pointed out fusion as a solution to our energy crisis and by using carefully engineered atrium's, mirrors to bounce sunlight in to the floors and indeed integrated wind &amp; solar generation capacities in to these farms they could be energy neutral (or close to it) more so once some of the stuff in the labs rolls in to production whereby any pane of glass is a photovoltaic cell.

But it is still restricting choice. And as parents can't control what the kid chooses in the canteen, you have to compare a typical lunchbox with the *least* healthy option in the canteen, because that is probably what they will choose.

I'm saying I would prefer it, I don't represent all of my compatriots but I know what's best for my community, both activity and longevity wise.

eSports cannot grow without a following, our following will not come from the public but from gamers, the more gamers, the more following.

Gamers follow the games they compete in but why compete in a game where every single tournament is stacked with people who are salaried to play.

It'd be like Messi signing up for your local pub 5 aside league for £100 nicker.

Granted some people would kill to play against Messi but say you can play Messi every single day of the week without spending a penny, why would you pay to play versus him in a 5 aside league, when you can do it for free from the comfort of your own home.

So what happens then, these teams don't attend the 5asides, the pros stop entering, the tournament fades and dies or it becomes a pro only event but the people watching never increase as no-one below the pros are competing any more.

Which leads to less viewers as they don't come from the public and people get bored and move on to newer games and eventually the game  dies. (See Counter-Strike 1.6)

No-one wants to pay money to enter an event they are never going to win. I'm not saying it's beyond the UK's ability to compete, hell even take a map off some of these teams but to win? Don't kid yourself.

So you get sponsored but if you're not winning because every single tournament is 'cluster-fucked' with people who play this game for a living (note, everyone you watch on joinDota or where-ever). The sponsors don't want a team who places 8th, unless that 8th is the world.

So you lose your sponsorship and can't financially attend (Note, the average dota demographic are uni/just finished uni students, any one know a rich uni student?).

These are players with 7/8 years experience on any newcomer, the later you start, the more experience they have. This is not a game you can pick up and suddenly be amazing, as it's team based and therefore it comes down to your team, teamwork x time = success.

Another Prime example is Natural9/old aL (Australians) amazing players, the best Australia has to offer, Australia has no local scene, they no longer exist as a line-up.

These guys were at BOTH Internationals but they can't sustain a solid line-up or compete with other countries that have home grown scenes and communities.

A lot of teams don't even attend Star Ladder finals in Kiev because it's a bastard to get to. These issues don't exist in the United Kingdom and it'd be a damn side cheaper for Americans to attend a UK event than a Ukrainian event.

So we become the home of the competition and end up with no representation.

This is not good for eSports, or gaming in any form.

It's brilliant if you host events here but not if you're a competitor.

Final note: Every competitive sponsored team in the UK is in the Pro scrim group; within the time i've just taken to write this I could have played EG, 3DMax, Fnatic, Next.Kz and several other tier2/3 teams.

Then, about a month after a season ends, or about a month into the mid-season break, it just dwindled off, with nobody having much of substance to discuss.  There was a slow trickle, but nothing like when there's new stuff actively airing.

What you're seeing is what happens when a community dedicated to the appreciation and discussion of a rather narrow subject matter doesn't have anything to discuss and is limited merely to the appreciation.

I definitely disagree with your mentality regarding foreign interest in tournaments. I don't know how much experience you have had in gaming communities, quite possibly more than me! But I'm wrong 30 or 40 times a day so no use in avoiding it:

To be fair, my experience comes from a different game - CoD4. And in the same fairness it's difficult to compare the two because the player base for that kind of FPS is significantly larger and more accessible than the natural player base of DotA and DotA2. But I think some parallels can be drawn which quite easily dismiss your reluctance to see more significant prize pools. Because that's what we're talking about basically - prize pools. With low prize pools the only people that can justify attendance are local teams, which is what we have in the UK at the moment for DotA2 (and pretty much every other game to be honest). But the problem is, you think that this lack of foreign attendance equates to a more rewarding LAN experience for the lesser skilled UK teams when it actually doesn't. 

I'll give you an example from Epic Lan: You were there, sat about 15 feet from me. Now you probably don't pay much attention to the CoD4 or FPS scene, but we actually had the biggest tournament at the event, and that game is totally dead. 12 teams turned up, and because we had free tickets, my friends and I decided to form up a mix and show up for some easy money. The reason for this being that it would be like 3DMax showing up for the tournament you participated in. Now from your point of view, this implies that the other teams would or should have been disheartened by the fact that what was previously anyone's game, was suddenly a 95% chance of victory for a mix team. But they weren't...they all showed up and had a great weekend. Yeah they got steamrolled by us but they had fun doing it and competing and having an enjoyable few drunken days with their friends fucking about on computers. That's how it works and that's what is great about LANs. And you know when the scene was the most vibrant? When the prize purses were £5k - £10k and we had teams from all over the world turning up in Stoneleigh to compete at an Iseries. We had 96 teams in those tournaments, and 95% of them knew with 100% certainty that they were going to get assraped by the top 7-10 teams. Didn't stop them coming.

You might be right and I might be wrong, but it seems folly to me to be reticent about the potentiality for big prize pots in your scene. Because that's what drives the interest. The top 20-30 teams think they might have a chance and the bottom 60 get to have a go and if it all goes pear shaped they can just have a few drinks and watch decent players play. Your point about Messi seems strange - you say no one will turn up to play him. I don't really believe you but even if you're right, you know who will turn up to watch him? Fucking everyone. And while we're not there with e-sports, we're not so weak that having famous faces turn up for tournaments can be considered a bad thing.

I don't think it's right if they do exploit the system and get free labour, when they could have comfortably created a full or part time job. And yes a fairer system would be at least for the companies to pay money on top of the JSA to take it up to min wage. At least less people would complain!

I don't know if some of these companies were offering paid/unpaid work experience to jobseekers, before these schemes were introduced that made it ""mandatory"". If not, then maybe the only way they would take people on is if they didn't have to pay for their time. For some people desperate to do anything to get paid work eventually, these various placements might be a godsend. And then there are others who have no intention of getting a job and are happy to just live off benefits - probably a minority but still a significant number. If they refused to take part and didn't get any JSA, then good. If they worked for a few weeks and found out it wasn't so bad, then maybe after they went out and got a job. In some ways I just see it as tough love. Some people need a kick up the backside. And I thought a lot of these things were only for people on benefits 6+ months. I think there has to be a way to determine if someone is really serious about getting back to work, and maybe this is one of the most effective ways.

I think you have a point about local LANs for the UK in that you need grass root LANs in order to help grow the scene. And things like that should be organised by YOU as the community, not Epic LAN or Iseries for that matter. However almost everything else you mention is just utter twosh.

The more high skilled top teams you see at an event = the more concurrent stream views = the more the tournament organisers can push for in terms of sponsorship. Placing in a tournament is not the most important consideration for teams in picking up Esports squads and if it is that team is being run by idiots. Exposure generated by the events attended and generally having the team on board is the key to what teams should be looking at. As that is how they justify the ROI to sponsors. Anyway my point on this is for that for UK teams to increase their sponsorship and skill level having top level Dota2 events held somewhere here in the UK are utterly key. 

You totally under value the opportunity LANs here in the UK would be for UK teams to compete against the top tier and learn from them. In something that is a completely different environment to online play.
Also you must consider the value of exposing a game such as Dota to other people within esports who perhaps become interested and then play casually (Such as myself).

My problem with the UK Dota scene is that from all that I have seen of it, it's filled with clueless moron's such as yourself. And it has massively discouraged me from taking an interest and participating in it.

Please do ask me any questions you may have on how to really benefit ""your"" scene. You might be surprised at actually how much more about esports you have to learn. Essentially take your blinkers off.

Instead, what he's done is he's turned adventuring into a business. The way it works is:

Year 1: Plan &amp; train for an adventure. You **never** go with your own money; you get corporate sponsorship and as much publicity as you possibly can. This is part of your planning, it's a prerequisite to going and you'll spend a fair bit of this year schmoozing to arrange it.

Year 2: Go on your adventure - whether it's conquer the antarctic, Everest or whatever. This has to be a genuine challenge, something that really pushes the limits of human endurance - a holiday is precisely what you don't want to be going on.

Year 3: Go on a speaking tour. You can charge a fair bit of money as ""hero who conquered Everest gives a motivational speech"", which is precisely what you do.  That money is going to pay your bills and feed you.

Lather, rinse and repeat.

The more recently you succeeded in an adventure, the more money you can charge for public speaking.

true,imwoods,lucifer,༼ ᕤ◕◡◕ ༽ᕤ,"@h debate, we all love a good debate.

I started off with CS beta, competed in nearly every title (bar CoD/WoW/Arenashooters) since.

The player base of Dota is larger and will be larger than any other game in the world upon release. (The only competitor being LoL who fudge their numbers but are the only competitor who are even close to surpassing Dota).

Bigger prize pools are great for the best players, I love the fact that people can actually make a living off of gaming but. Only the people who win.

The argument that low prize pools mean that only local teams will attend is already dis proven with imG attending epicTEN for the prize of £525. This is a team who've placed 3rd at ESWC.

I don't follow CoD because it's laden with cheating fucks, this is also the main reason I no longer play competitive CS of any form (also i'm i've got Grandad reactions now).

You guys didn't have to play over 12 hours of straight games, then another 10 the next day. There was 0 time for anything but dota for us.

It's a difficult one, you can't really compare CoD to Dota, one player can have an event of his life, like this robez guy in this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmk5vyAIoQ (he's fucking mental)

A player alone can win the entire game in CoD for his team, this doesn't happen in Dota and never will.

Not that it happens often but with any FPS game if a player goes absolutely mental an average team can still 'luck' out.

Then there's the fact that people cheat in CoD, so LAN is the ultimate platform for competition, no-one can cheat in Dota, if you can play an opponent online with equal ping, it may as well be LAN.

All of our epicLAN games were on online servers.

Everything great about going to LAN for games like CoD doesn't exist in Dota, I can open my game now and watch any player in the entire world playing, I can even do it and control my own camera.

We already have the big prize pots, G1 League finals is $52,000, TI3 will be 1.6 million again.

I'm talking purely about everything below this level of play.

CoD as you admit is practically dead and I bet it's because of the reasons i'd made before, every event even a small one like epic has top teams in attendance.

There are about 30 UK teams/mixes in Dota, I know for a fact that at least 24 of them will never attend events like this because they cannot compete for first place.

A lot of growth with eSports is getting people in the door, I have a list as long as my arm of players who stuck with our community and have improved ten-fold.

If they'd have been part of the international competitive community they'd have already folded and would no longer be playing.

I'll stand by my point and we can come back to it in a few months time, You will only see mix teams and two/three UK representatives at any of our home LAN events because I know for a fact that foreign teams will flock to them in the numbers.

I am quite nonplussed at your claim. Even the spokesman of the students involved wasn't claiming that. In the story. he said that once this was in place it would 'open the door' for the university to have power over what was talked about. Of course the university -like any property owner- already does have legal authority to decide what its property is used for, but practically-speaking, it couldn't stop any students associate, speak, worship and think whatever they choose. Can you say how you believe the university might legally do this?

The students' lawyer, takes an entirely different line of argument. He says that any such action by the university might be illegal if it is based on the faith of the group involved. That is most likely true, but there doesn't seem to be any allegation that the faith of the group is being targeted uniquely by the university's policy. All the uni has to do is enforce the rule equally, and everyone is a winner, except any extremists. Extremists are also free to associate, worship and think on the uni premises. If they want to make extremist speech, they are free to do that elsewhere.  

I do think this satisfies the relevant rights laws. It also might aid the uni's obligation to provide a learning environment free from harassment for all its students. IANAL.",0,1361824433,null,0,1361824815,0,c8ligcc,t3_191j30,t1_c8ligcc,t1_c8lhgvi,null,1431407728,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I wouldn't mind a little 4-2-2-2, the way Mancini plays it. Standard back four. Rock Mikel + Someone as the first two. They play central and hold. Someone could be Lampard, could be Oscar, could be a new player, I'm not sure. Mata plays on one side, but is free to drift inside if needed, Moses on the other. One real striker, one shadow striker (Hazard) who drops into the hole if needed, or outside if needed.

It's an unbalanced formation. There's a designed hole between the opponents' midfield and defense, which is filled by either the outside playmaker or the shadow stiker. Its sort of a flavor of what Barca do with Messi.

It puts the other team in a tough position tactically. Let's say Hazard drops in the hole and you're the other team, what do you do? If a center half steps with him then Mata pushes up high and its 3v3 at the back and you rip them up. If they start marking with a midfielder, Mata goes wide and Hazard tries to draw the midfielder back towards the back line. Then your second holding player steps up (there will be more space) and you're in a 4-1-3-2 against a team sitting deep, which is good.

The minor crimes he is referring to are small crimes like vandalism, drunk &amp; disorderly, fistfights, etc; basically they are little things that make a big difference to the feeling of safety and quality of life in a neighborhood.  I would guess it's related to the ""broken windows"" theory, which is fairly controversial if I understand it correctly.

Bratton is also very famous in the US for being the first to implement a system called CompStat in which statistics are used to direct police resources.

Generally, he is well respected here, but there is a fair amount of debate as to whether the falling crime rates in NY and LA were due to his innovative policing strategies, or falling crime rates generally, gentrification of urban areas, etc.  I haven't read much in the past about him with regards to the methods mentioned in the article, so I am not sure whether that is something new or just less discussed here.

As an aside though, I hope UK redditors will take reddit propaganda concerning US police officers with a grain of salt.  I had a few run-ins in my youth and never encountered anything unprofessional.  There are problems with the police, but the main problems in the US are with the laws, courts, and prison system.

You can read about that in the other comments here.

But mainly I think it's because it was done on purpose. It was planned by the Conservatives while they were in opposition. And then right–wing free–market government struck a deal with the Communists in Poland to build up a stockpile of coal in the UK so what they could stand a strike. And then the NUM were provoked into striking (and Scargill fell for that). 

It was ideologically driven social engineering on a grand scale. It was done brutally. It changed the relationship between the working class and the ruling class, it changed the relationship between the police and the population at large, it changed the relationship between the government and the governed.

Also, their unwillingness (MOSTLY) to make runs off of the ball in the defensive and middle third of the park. Their need to be on the ball at all times leaves hazard, moses, and ramires (when he plays the wing isolated), as well as our striker.

What's gone wrong is we've been told to hate the unemployed and indeed, anyone on benefits, and the withdrawal of certain grants and loans, along with expecting people to be able to travel 90 minutes each to a minimum wage job for six weeks without any money to do the travelling with, makes no sense in terms of actually getting them back to work.

I'm not trying to 'go easy' or 'be nice' to the unemployed, I'm simply offering ideas to remove the obvious barriers that used to have a solution and have been removed. 

a little money invested in someone can get them back into long term, full time employment, and paying taxes again.  How people see that as being 'soft' I don't know.  We've got so into beating them with a big stick that we assume they're being lazy by not getting back up, and not just beaten unconscious in the gutter.

As for us not having pre existing structures needing volunteers, that's why politicians are supposed to THINK of SOLUTIONS.  We refill the libraries and open them longer, we get people into the furniture recycling charities and spread the word, we make sure people know they can call on people they know in the community to help them with painting, cleaning, basic repairs, IT stuff, etc.

I helped out in my local community, just word of mouth, and I'd pop around when I could and fix little problems, maybe install a printer, sometimes it was just a case of changing the cartridges, but I'd never charge, and I sure as hell would never tell the authorities.  Only because they wouldn't believe anyone would do something for nothing, and I'd be fitted up for fraud.  As it is, I got to give a little back, maybe paying back a bit of my benefits in the way I knew how, and other people who weren't well off didn't have to blow maybe eighty quid on a visit to the local PC shop.  I have my limits however, and if I couldn't help, I'd advise them that's where to go.

Lastly, ""Or perhaps you feel that each and every unemployed person should be taken by the hand and offered a tailor made solution that fits their every requirement."" Yes, yes, I do, as that's exactly what the Jobcentre used to do, match people to a suitable job, instead of what it's been turned into, a place to find reasons to stop people's benefit, regardless of how much jobhunting they've done.  IF the Jobcentre's not trying to match people to the available vacancies, it's failing both the jobseekers, and the taxpayer.

true,mikeanthony80,null,null,"I sometimes daydream thinking about what our team could play. I was probably pushing too far with thinking about 3 at the back, because I too think we don't have the personnel for that system. However the next manager may drop Terry and not play him, and if that were the case anything could happen. Ivanovic on the right side of a 3, and Luiz are already two ideal players for a 3 at the back system. And Barcelona somehow manage to fit an old and slow player in Puyol into their sort-of-3-at-the-back system. Also on chelseatv one of the backroom staff mentioned that the long term plan for Oscar was to play him deep alongside someone like Mikel. He did a good job higher up the pitch against Pirlo earlier in the season, and once he gets used to our style of play, they see him playing deeper, maybe in a Pirlo type position himself.

Moving on to Man City, the problem with Mancini's system as I see it, and with the way you mentioned us playing it, is that it's too narrow. Man City have a fundamental problem with breaking teams down sometimes, and rely too heavily on the likes of Toure to batter through teams. You can see they are in desperate need of an out and out winger, and as Michael Cox at zonalmarking mentions below, some of their best play comes from their (often too rare) wingplay.

http://www.zonalmarking.net/2012/08/14/mancini-to-use-a-three-man-defence-as-his-plan-b/

But you're probably right in the end. Whoever comes in, whether it's a manager who currently favours a 3 man defence or not, they will see our squad of players and stick with a flat 4, and tinker with the rest. We're probably not far from being a very good side. We just need a manager who can instil in them a winning mentality, and drill into their heads a proper system of play, with the ability to be flexible. The formation probably only needs tweaking. It's the coaching on the training ground that will need a lot of work, and our current manager is too incompetent to achieve anything there. Who do you think (or want) to be our next manager?

Upload your CV, and you can apply for jobs with a single click, and it's all stored on your file that they can see on the JSA computers, do that a few times a day, applying for any old shit, and once that's done, you've sated your almighty overlords at the Jobcentre, and can get on with actually looking for work, and applying for proper jobs without the threat of sanctions looming over your head.

UJ made it so much easier for me to hit my targets as I had to put zero effort into applying for the stuff I didn't want, while allowing me to write down the occasional decent job that showed up and spend real time doing a proper application with covering letters etc.

One thing I will say however, is be careful, because if you piss off your random 'advisor of the week', they'll sanction you for some reason only a professional proctologist could even read, and while you can appeal, you'll sit there with nothing for months while they slowly mull it over, knowing you're fucked either way.  A proper appeal process wouldn't leave you fucked while they make a decision.

It didn't help that their agriculture collapsed into a dust bowl through bad practices like overgrazing and then several colonial powers came into existence, which is far from them adopting a ""luddite"" mentality or a preference for going backwards. Agriculture has an historic pattern of turning peoples into migratory colonisers where the grass is always greener and the current space is various shades of brown.

&gt; Pardon?

I'm not sure of your background, perhaps science fiction or that pseudo-science of economics, but to build in resilience you build in decentralisation and redundancy. It's a first principle for many engineering disciplines. Some very sensitive areas are in our supply chains.

&gt; The answer to any of these problem is: accelerate scientific endeavours and discoveries.

You are actually working from a false premise. There is already enough food being produced despite the largess of the landed gentry. Underpinning profit agricultural profit models is artificial scarcity where the industry not only rides on obesity  The real problem is distribution which  encompasses everything from resources, healthcare and capital. Those that are in greatest need of food security are those with the least amount of money to spend, and big business rarely caters for the poor because there is just not enough profit in it. Very often farmers get paid not to grow things, so you aren't quite correct there either.

&gt; we can only forwards

Other than entropic drift biology is directionless and as a species I actually see us going backwards, or at least repeating the mistakes of every empire past. There is what works and what does not, and ""old technology"" can be far more sensitive to human needs and far more appropriate for the tax at hand. I actually see stagnation where incumbents force people to work in the taxed economy to legitimise our own existence. Further centralising agriculture is likely to make that worse. Progress for me is not forcing people into dreary employment through basically starvation. All people need is modest food and a roof, then perhaps with all that free time you could have the scientific utopia after all.

No way. Earlier here on r/doctorwho someone made a post called  ""Episode 113 - Happiness Through Acceptance"" which was downvoted twice, upvoted once (by me). Nobody apparently understands the significance of that phrase. It is a mantra recited by a strange dystopian society in a Divergent Universe that the 8th Doctor visits in the 8th Doctor Adventures audio series. Sure, it's not *the tv show* but it's part of the 50-year-long DW universe.

There is always more to talk about.

You're talking absolute bollocks.

&gt; I'd have more sympathy for cyclists if they actually stopped at red lights instead of mowing me down everytime I step out into the road, which is a regular occurance in London

If mowing people down at lights is a regular occurrence, why do the stats say otherwise.

The reality of who's a danger on our roads and who runs red lights:

According a Freedom of Information (FoI) request made in 2008, in **London**, where cycle and 
pedestrian flows are high and signalled junctions ubiquitous: 

**No pedestrian was killed in collision with a cyclist going through a red light between 1998-2007** 
and cyclists were involved in only a small percentage of injuries to them. 

**Vehicles involved in pedestrian fatalities**

http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/sep/28/road-deaths-great-britain-data

&gt; 233 pedestrians died following collisions with single cars - more than were killed in incidents involving any other type of vehicle.

&gt; 65 pedestrians were killed in incidents involving two or more vehicles, while 61 died after a collision with an HGV or light goods vehicle (LGV). Two pedestrians died after collisions with cyclists - fewer than any other vehicle.

On the other hand, I can find deaths from motorists jumping red lights including the case where two [children died](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/9458112/Two-toddlers-in-pushchairs-die-after-car-jumps-red-light.html).

**6,000** motorists caught jumping red lights in the same road in only one week:

http://www.sloughobserver.co.uk/news/slough/articles/2012/08/02/61547-more-than-6000-motorists-caught-jumping-red-lights-in-the-same-road-in-only-one-week/

**15,000** motorists caught jumping red lights in Bristol (plus **120,000** going on courses for breaking the speed limits):

http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/15-000-motorists-caught-jumping-red-lights-Bristol/story-11252121-detail/story.html

If it's such a regular occurrence, how come:

* Pedestrians killed by CYCLE 22 
* Pedestrians seriously injured by CYCLE 510

These are the stats for the entire of the UK?

After two years of unemployment, you are the problem. Long term unemployment, which is what this scheme is set up to fix, has many causes, most of them due to the fact it snowballs. The longer you've been out of work the worse it gets right?  Businesses won't trust you, and you lose any motivation or real experience of work.

I used to work in a cafe, busy eight hour shifts. We got some fat bird down from glasgow, she had moved in with her family where I was after being unemployed for a year and a half. After an hour, or an hour and a half, she asked if she could sit down because her feet were tired. It didn't occur to her that soldiering on would probably be better for her long term, and she kept doing this, every two or three hours or so, at least twice a shift. She was mid twenties with no obvious disability. She did not last long. She didn't have the work ethic to work in a sandwich shop, and my boss had to spend time and money hiring her, training her, and lose money while his best staff were training as opposed to on the floor.

And honestly you're hilarious. There are millions of unemployed people in the UK. The government has embraced this scheme and its working well. However, that doesn't mean one size fits all. Nor should it. You're living in this fictional world where someone is prevented from getting a job by the evil mandarins at the dept of something. Don't be so stupid. The girl claimed in her court case that the rules stopped her from getting volunteer work. They didn't say she had any or that she could not get any. She said they stopped her, because of the 15 hour mark.

It's an entirely new thing as well that everyone gets the job they want or should get. Seems there are no more toilet cleaners in the UK. ""the only job they could ever do"" Bullshit. 

By the way, fixing your neighbours computers? Gosh you're sweet, but most people I know (including me) do that for free most of the time anyway.

true,Ragekitty,US,usa,"Something obviously has got to give and soon or we're about to embark on a slow, downward spiral into Liverpool territory. What I mean is that ever since Roman has been involved, the expectation to win silverware is there year after year after year. We're meant to be a legendary club.

The problem? It's largely unidentifiable. Some people are choosing to blame Benitez. Some people prefer to pick on Torres. Other people might blame the board. I honestly don't know who or what is to blame.

The truth is that other clubs are coming into their own and playing equally brilliant football at similar levels as titans like Barcelona, Manchester United, etc. This equalization means that winning silverware is that much more important.

In terms of what I think might help us:

* Change the formation: Obviously this lone striker formation isn't working as intended. We have talented midfielders who excel at creating plays. Why not allow them the freedom to stay forward at times when possession is 50/50? The way I understand it now is that our 3 attacking midfielders are supposed to get back to defend if we lose possession. That leaves one guy forward. I'd like to see an experimentation with a false 9 or even a 4-3-3.

* Change the manager: Obviously we dislike Benitez both for past and present transgressions. The man doesn't have the respect of the fans and I'm not sold on the idea that the players respect him. We need someone who brings passion and emotion to the club. We need someone who is devastated with a loss and overjoyed with a victory. I was watching the Spurs/West Ham game earlier and AVB looked monumentally excited when Bale scored his second. I miss that kind of passion. With RDM, he was that guy. Unfortunately he got the boot after a string of poor performances. Ideally, I'd love to see Mourinho return. Failing that, we need someone to respark our lads and get them firing on all cylinders again.

* Change the expectation: What I mean is that this season seems like a total wash for us right now. We're out of the Champions League. We won't be able to challenge Man Utd for the EPL title. The FA Cup and Europa League are the only competitions left where we have a chance to win silverware. At this point, we have a choice to make. We obviously don't have the depth to go all-in for every competition. Do we push hard for Europa League and wing it for the FA Cup? What about the EPL? What's our goal here? Do we ultimately want to get back to CL football next season? If so, EPL must come first but at what cost? I'm not in charge of anything -- just a humble fan. But I will say that I'd rather see us have a rebuilding season next year and forget about CL until we get a rock solid manager with a rock solid bench and starting eleven. I feel like if we keep pushing for CL football, the expectations are too high, too stressful, and too taxing for the club. I'd love to hear what you guys think though.

There are several things that I'd love to see happen. For instance, how great would it be if we finally found something to make Torres tick regularly? We'd have our 50 million pound striker doing work finally. Failing that, a change in formation would be my next suggestion. Find a way to incorporate the flowing Barcelona-style football with our current roster by changing our formation. Start experimenting with different guys in different positions. At this point, I don't think we'd have much to lose. Of course I want to see Rafa out, but I'd be willing to suffer through more of his managerial presence if he started tweaking our formation a bit more or started showing some more emotion on the sidelines aside from ""would you like lemon in your water, sir?""

I'm talking hundreds of years where agriculture is net destructive, and to take one metric, average soil depths have decreased over time which can be contrasted to forest or jungle where fertility is not bettered. The exact opposite occurs with constant soil creation. Look at the regions where agriculture has existed the longest: mesopotamia, east into China, and west into southern Europe. It's all very brown and deforestation to make may for agriculture has been a significant force in that regard. Over time the soil becomes depleted or over grazed, so traditionally it just meant clearing another section of forest and slaying the golden goose again, but eventually you are going to hit sea. The Harbor process managed to prolong the cycle a little bit with the side effect of [burning through the carbon content of the soil](http://grist.org/article/2010-02-23-new-research-synthetic-nitrogen-destroys-soil-carbon-undermines/) which has been know for nearly 80 years now.

I'm not sure where you are getting your information about potatoes because they like rich soil to begin with. Legumes are the traditional ""pioneer"" plant and if you are interested look up [""green manure""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_manure).

I don't know what GM crops have to do with anything because they too require fertilisers because the nitrogen is just not there. Perhaps you are thinking of short term or obfuscated pesticide reduction.

The difference is that whilst the Third Way had an ideological basis and was essentially well meaning. Waldo is really about nihilism. And violence really - the shoe throwing moment at the end seems to presage the end of the old world and a creation of a new and darker one.

In fact if you look at other multinational political franchises with a taste for violence they tended to be very bad news indeed - Stalinist Communism and Fascism spring to mind.  Leo Strauss called them examples of 'brutal nihilism' which he contrasted with the 'gentle nihilism' common in liberal democracies. It seems like Waldo's coarseness and his taste for violence once Napier takes over mean that brutal nihilism takes over from gentle nihilism. You could argue that Gwendolyn's comment about the election being about screen time and the general contempt everyone shows for politics is gentle nihilism. The scene at the end with the police tasing the tramps is perhaps indicative of a more brutal version.

I think it would have been cool if at the end the world was split into countries each dominated by their own version of Waldo. Rather like in 1984 each megastate presumably has much the same system but they call it by different names and fight constantly. 

You can also view the episode as being about the media elite's deep fear of populism. There are many policies that are favoured by that elite but despised by the general public and vice versa. Still there is always a chance that a populist candidate may one day win power democratically by offering to abolish them.

So populism is usually portrayed as being very bad in the sense that 1984 was very bad. Now it's not at all clear that a populist regime would be anything like that.",0,1361833579,null,0,1361834793,0,c8lls5c,t3_197uw3,t1_c8lls5c,t1_c8llex9,null,1431409326,18,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,18

Rates vary; he's with a credit union (I'm not sure what that actually means, but it might mean something to you). Your ordinary PIN number will work. If you want to pay by card in a shop, they should be able to swipe your card, and you'll have to sign, not use the PIN. I know it's common not to sign the back of your credit or debit card in the US, but it **must** be signed here or it's not valid.

Bear in mind though, that immigration will want you to have enough money to support yourself during your stay, or you can be refused entry. This means cash, basically, probably at least £10 per day (assuming accommodation is taken care of). Exchanging at the airport, particularly after landing in the UK, will be a *horrible* rate, so try to buy sterling before you leave. If you only bring the minimum in cash, a recent bank statement showing how much you have available would also be handy.

There should be a map of the airport online which will tell you if there's an ATM on airside arrivals, but beware that this might charge you per transaction in addition to your bank's charges.

Whether or not it's true your average irk will respect a nice area more, from my experiences doing police work I've seen that a shitty area will get treated worse. Cracking down on the minor stuff, particularly in areas where there's a specific and localised problem, will have a big effect on the feeling and attitude of the locals, plus the future behaviour of the culprits.

Speaking more generally, there are countless reasons that we can't fix out current state and the gradual decline in morality and behaviour. These bad, selfish attitudes that result in crime and ASB have taken decades to evolve into what they are and ultimately fall to lack of parenting ability over generations. As much as I'm on side with this bloke, he won't be able to fix the root cause and we'll always now be firefighting against certain segments of criminality.

Things are unlikely to improve when we have senior cops angling for ""increasing community confidence and scrapping targets""... I don't agree with targets, but the way I'm watching it develop is becoming a statement that ""we don't care that we're not trying hard to solve your crime because we're smiley and nice when we give our shitty excuses, but you give us nice feedback so hey ho"".
Until we truly simplify policing we're boned. I'd much rather we just got on with the job and didn't spend our time trying to please everyone. We all know the number if we need the police in an emergency, it doesn't need advertising (or ""visibility"" as it's called), it's a purposeless exercise that achieves nothing for society.

Housing is much more expensive, you have quite a bit of taxes to pay. The cheapest option is to share a house with friends, and that's usually $500/month and covers utilities, but you still have to pay for food and your mobile.

Kind of. There are actually two different ones that people confuse.

I was introduced to alcohol at a younger age gradually by my folks (excluding the one New Year's Eve party when I swiped a 4 pack of Beamish from the cupboard aged 12 and got tanked off my own stupid back). I got quite drunk semi-regularly from around age 15 and had a little rebellion against my parents because I ""knew everything""; but i can confidently say that I never did any harm to anyone else. I never pissed in bus stops, damaged anything or did anything that could be construed as being a drunken rampage.

The point I'm making is that it's about parenting in general, not the attitude toward drink alone.
Some people are predisposed to violence and alcohol magnifies this, whether it originates from nature or nurture isn't really relevant.

My parents raised me to be a considerate and polite human with a strong work ethic and a sense of morality. Despite the fact that I would drink, it hasn't meant I'm now the spawn of Beelzebub himself, in fact I'm well behaved and gainfully employed thanks to two decent parents. Even when 15 and full of shitty cider I was still conscious to be polite to others, it was the way I was brought up.

These alcohol contracts are like closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.

Man City do struggle in that sense, and I think the answer to that for us (if we were to adopt a similar system) is that our players are more flexible. We would already have Moses on the field in my system, who is a traditional winger, and if we are struggling to break down a team we could push Hazard onto the left wing, Mata central, and play a 4-3-3.

Anyway though, like you said, all daydreams.

As far as a manger goes I'm incredibly torn. If Mou can come back and establish himself at the club long term, I'd want him. I'm just not sure that Roman is capable of that, or that Mou himself would want to do it.

I wanted Brendan Rodgers before he went to Liverpool. Despite some poor results I think he is doing a fine job there: he's got them playing well and their future is bright.

So then who? I'm not sure. I like Laudrup and Moyes. Laudrup seems to have a more developed tactical sense, while Moyes has proven he can keep a club consistent from year to year.

Communities had sprung up around the coal mines and related industries, in which almost everyone's livelihood depended ultimately upon the continuing operation of the coalmines. There was no need for a diverse economy, and so none developed. Then, once these towns no longer had their pits, a massive number became unemployed - up to 50% in places - and little effort was made to create new jobs (for instance, Tebbit's famous ""on yer bike"" misquotation accurately represents the policies of the time). This was all totally foreseeable, and any reasonably competent government would have taken strong steps to mitigate the damage.

There's also an important sense in which the strike itself divided the traditionally close-knit mining town communities against themselves, with much ill will between factions supporting and opposing the strike - which frequently became violent.

In short, it was a horrible time characterised by antagonism between the government and a significant portion of the population, who were daily demonised throughout the press and by their elected representatives, who were subjected to fairly brutal police treatment and who saw the close-knit communities in which they'd lived since childhood disintegrate into discord and violence, followed by a spiral of decline into ghost towns whilst an indifferent government trumpeted its economic success and deified Gekko-style Champagne-quaffing City gamblers. By 1994 the Grimethorpe area was identified as one of the poorest in the whole of the EU - taken from prosperous to impoverished in under 15 years. It's no surprise that the anger persists.

Plus he is the 12th highest paid manger in world football. He isn't THAT good. There's probably a reason no big club has opted to hire him, like no big club chose to hire Benitez for years and years. Look how that turned out. 

I have the same fears about Mourinho as you do. He doesn't have a track record of lasting more than a few seasons at a club, and perhaps more importantly he doesn't ever bring through youth players. After working so hard to get to where we are now, I would not be a happy bunny if suddenly our youth setup were cast aside in favour of big signings like Essien and Drogba back in the day. 

I just have a sneaky feeling if Juventus win the league again and do well in the Champions League he may go for Conte. He is young and has that attitude that the club seems to seek. I had the same feeling about AVB when Porto were going on a tear a few years ago. With regard to Laudrup we haven't hired a manager in the past who's biggest achievement is a top half finish and a League Cup. It's big for Swansea, and he has the swagger, but you saw how hesitant Roman was to hire Di Matteo after winning the Champions League and FA Cup. Doing well with a club like Swansea might not be good enough for Abramovich. Also there were rumblings at the beginning of the season that he takes a lackadaisical approach to training. Our players don't tend to like that. Look what happened to Scolari.

By the way looking at Tottenham tonight makes me feel even worse about what happened to AVB last year. I really liked the guy, and with a pretty terrible squad they're now above us! I'm going to copy somebody's comment under the Guardian Tottenham match report, which I pretty much agree with 100%:

""I am a Chelsea fan who was, and remains, appalled by the sacking of AVB last year - so much so that I cut my season ticket in half and refused to go to the Bridge after he had gone.

That peformance by Spurs tonight illustrated what might have been. Not because they were brilliant, but because they kept going, they toughed it out, they found a way to win and because they have a palpably strong team spirit. It also demonstrated why Abramovich was so furious with the players when he decided he had to sack him and precisely why Lampard - as the biggest public moaner about AVB - will not be getting a new contract.

While I obviously hope above all that Chelsea can somehow hang on to a CL place despite having our worst manager of the Abramovich era, my genuine wish is for Spurs and AVB to get the other one.""

I would be more surprised if Lampard gets a contract than not right now. I think the people high up in the club won't forget the way he acted and he'll be getting nothing. Isn't it just a big coincidence that the media who only a few years ago called for Lampard to be dropped from the England team are now saying he is now so integral to Chelsea's team that he should be offered whatever he wants?!

Roman could see that firing AVB would probably fix the short term problems. The players would be happier and results would pick up.

**Somewhat Spoilers**

From what I have watched there are 2 stories that take place one after the other. We have the story of Rose Tyler which stretches threw to Martha Jones, and then to Donna Noble. After the doctor saves all of time he says good bye to his beloved companions. He then regenerates again and starts a new story with Amy Pond. Neither story is intertwined with each other. the only similarity is one woman, River Song.
And that is all i got at the moment.

It's one of the main things we export and one of the only things other than banking which is keeping the UK economy going, and one of our only traditional manufacturing bases left.

Whilst the government straight up giving them money would be dumb and phoney capitalism, there is a number of ways the government could sustainably help Rolls-Royce, all of which would piss off the rest of the EU. We could give them a range of tax breaks, we could revoke the anti-bribery legislation which was introduced under the last Labour government *(most people don't seem to realise that is how business gets done in a lot of other countries, the US got us to introduce this legislation then proceeded to rape our industry)*, or the government could decide to invest in a ""stellar"" defence project such as Concorde and show the rest of the world that Britain is still kick ass at this stuff and they can forget buying stuff from amateurs.

true,missginj,null,null,"There's a long history behind the relationship between unionist politicians and the Orange Order.

In the early years of the Orange Order, membership was mostly made up of working class men, and included very few landowners or members of the gentry. Immediately following the founding of the Order in 1795, Protestants who identified themselves as Orangemen partook in a wave of anti-Catholic actions that included a concerted attempt to run Catholics out of the province (the popular phrasing, harking back to Cromwell's intent, was ""To Hell or Connaught"") and was also accompanied by what was known as ""wrecking"": the smashing of the looms of rival Catholic linen workers. Orangeism gained a reputation of being disreputable and rough, which greatly limited its early political influence. The Order was alienated from the middle and upper classes until September 1796, when members of the lower class of Protestants and a section of the landed gentry teamed up to oppose the United Irishmen, who were at that time enjoying increasing popularity all over Ireland. The Rising of 1798 served to complete the process: stories of atrocities committed by the United Irishmen during the course of the rising increased membership in the Order, and before long the failed uprising had turned the Orange Order from a small, geographically- and politically-limited group into a large, nationwide, influential organization that included members of all classes as well as politicians.

Throughout the nineteenth century the Order came into conflict with the British government because its parades were wont to stir up sectarian conflict. At various times the state attempted to restrict Orange parades through legislation and policing action, and so the Order was kind of a political outlier until 1886.

Protestant opposition to the introduction of the possibility of Home Rule was a huge break for the Order politically speaking; the Order publicly and officially opposed Home Rule, putting its political ideology in line with the majority of Ulster's Protestants, who began to increasingly identify with the organization. 

As an organization that had vehemently opposed Home Rule and saw its popular support among unionists rise as a result, the Orange Order gained unprecedented political influence with the establishment of the new state at partition. The vast majority of UUP politicians counted themselves Orangemen, and the Order itself officially held 122 of 760 seats on the Ulster Unionist Council (the ruling body of the UUP), which lent it an *official* avenue of political influence. As you probably know, all of Northern Ireland’s Prime Ministers were Orangemen, and only three cabinet ministers during the entire stretch of the Stormont Era were *not* Orangemen. Orange parades became official rituals of state, and the Twelfth of July was made a national holiday. The Order became, for all intents and purposes, a symbol of the Protestant community’s instutionalized political hegemony.

I would hazard to guess that the ubiquity of Orange membership among contemporary unionist politicians stems from this intricate historical confluence of Orangeism with the idea of staunch, irreproachable unionism. Unionist cred?

Of course, the philosophy, political ideology, and actions of the Order seem to be increasingly out of step with a ""post""-Peace Process Northern Ireland and with the younger generation of voters, so I wonder if we'll see a corresponding decline in unionist politicians' membership (or at least in how publicly they display that membership).

true,safaridiscoclub,cnty-england,Reading / Gt. Yarmouth,"Agreed.  From Tesco two loaves of 50p bread and a 62p tub of peanut butter will create around four weeks worth of peanut butter sandwiches. (1 a day). Bananas are 14p each, so that's 70p a week to give your kid a banana every day. i.e. a month's worth of peanut butter sandwiches and bananas will cost you £1 + 62p + £2.80, or £4.42. If you want to give them a chocolate then a cake bar of some sort will be about 10p each. Add another £2. That's £6.50 for one month's lunch. 

£1.60 per week for a 39 week school year is £62.40 a year, or 10 hours on minimum wage.

Of course I'm not suggesting that kids can eat the same thing every day, but variation on those items won't cost a lot. You can get 30-odd slices of chicken roll for £1, for example, and mix and match the chocolates or cake bars.

Seeing a team work in action, maybe a clip in parliament. That would've then neatly led into the epilogue showing clearly how we got from the ending to dark and grim future crappiness - a scene I actually thought was going to be a teaser for a hopeful next series, in some way - and proven exactly how Waldo can be manipulated differently. Obviously there is a lot of speculation attached to Black Mirror, but in the episodes where this is most prevalent, we're offered one working example (eg. BRB - the rejection of the clone-robot-thing in this one case, WB - WB Justice Park...suggesting there are other forms of specific retribution parks, etc.). For me, the ending just came as a bit of a ""...err, WHAT?!"" and a liiiiiittle too far-removed/fetched.

Of course, I suppose it ended moderately better than I thought it was. I was anticipating the main guy's suicide. I did like the Question Time spoof section and found it hilarious that the Tory candidate called on an ad hominem attack...when just a moment before he'd done exactly the same thing! Or, at the very least, said that his opinion was worthless, which was tantamount to saying those people in the audience were similar.
