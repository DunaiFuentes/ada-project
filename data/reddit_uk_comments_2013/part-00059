true,heffalump232,null,null,"It seems that a lot of proprietors, esp. those who support full paywalls, think they are the be-all end-all solution to gaining lost revenue and that their popularity will remain constant. I think not. 

When you look at a subscription option for these newspapers, it's as if they presume all the readers are those who get it delivered every morning. If newspapers are on the decline anyway, due to the decline in print by younger readers and the loss of trust in newspapers, isn't this a ridiculous presumption? You also price a lot of people out - for The Times, I don't have £2/week every week to spend on news. (altogether it comes to around £8/month; that's more than I pay for Spotify or Netflix). 

This has the potential to go horribly wrong due to even more people moving to the BBC to get info on actual current affairs because 1) the BBC is considered relatively reliable, and 2) there's no upfront charge (licence fee). 

If the paywalls are here to stay, I think newspapers will have to switch to a more 'upmarket magazine' format if they want to survive; they will have to join the ranks of The Economist or The Spectator or even VICE (whose editor gave an informative interview in the [Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2013/mar/23/shane-smith-vice-interview) recently), with more emphasis on special reports and providing better journalism, rather than a broad synopsis of today's events. And if they do charge, I think the ideal way will have to be more *a la carte*, like buying songs from iTunes. (50p here, £1 there, and perfectly possible).

In fact it would be very easy to set someone up if you have access to their computer. Install TrueCrypt, create an encrypted drive with any old rubbish in it, hiding the file in some not-too-obvious folder and using a secure password that even you'll never remember. Wait a while (so you're opportunity isn't easily traceable) then make an anonymous accusation mentioning terrorist plans/child porn/whatever. Sure you could plant actual child porn on someones computer, but to do that you'd have to risk getting caught with that child porn yourself - this way there's no child porn but there's no way for your victim to prove (or even know) that.

Seriously, I think this is an absurd law - much better suited for people making malicious accusations with minimal risk to themselves than to protecting the country or ensuring justice.

I think it would be best to protect everyone's money above all else. It is of my opinion that we find a UK member who has the funding to initially front a big part of the shirt ordering cost themselves. Require a 20% deposit of total costs from the US/CAN members paid to the UK member with the assumption that it is non-refundable*. The UK member would be protected by the assumed Megastore return policy. I.E. if a US/CAN member fails to pay up, they can just return their shirts back to the Megastore and get their money back. The US/CAN members would have comfort in knowing that if the UK member doesn't follow through and runs with the money, they are only risking $10-$15 instead of the entire purchase price. 

*I say non-refundable with the assumption that there is a risk the UK member will not follow through. If they are a trusting person, I imagine they would have no issue with refunding you your deposit in the event you wish to cancel your order, so long as they are able to return the shirts to the Megastore or sell them to someone else.

Ultimately I would love for an active UK member to volunteer as I feel they would be more trusting. EnglishMD comes to mind. *wink wink*

true,Leonichol,cnty-uk,Geordie in exile (Surrey),"They made a key mistake in the introduction of this reform. And that was to cut benefit by a percentage from number of rooms, rather than award benefit based on number rooms starting from 0.

----
**Private sector Housing Benefit has this system:**

HB = (LHA Weekly Rate) + (AllowedRooms * RoomRate) + Additional Considerations

**Meanwhile, Social sector/housing associations have this system:**

HB = (LowerofRentOrMaxRate - Random factors relating to income etc)

**The new social sector system is**

HB = (LowerofRentOrMaxRate - Random factors relating to income etc) - (occupancy%)

----
So conceivably you could receive more if you are in social sector housing presently than if you are in private sector (although this is unlikely as the max rate is =&lt; than the LHA rate). So this does in fact look like a cut. When in reality, it is just bringing it in line with the current system for the private sector recipients (a much less progressive award, despite changes to public sector award).

I imagine there would have been much less media backlash, had they just brought it completely inline with the private sector formula rather than using cuts as an additional step of the calculation.

Social sector tenants are therefore still at an advantage. All they have to do is knock down walls. Private sector tenants get no such tricks - it doesn't matter if they underoccupy, as they only get paid for their allowed rooms (usually 1) regardless of rent cost.

&gt;I'm not exactly a legal mind, but isn't refusing to allow them to check your hard drive if they have a valid warrant to do so, pretty much admitting you have something on there that you shouldn't have?

**Should you be compelled to help them prosecute you**

What you describe isn't quite the situation; they can check, you get prosecuted for not helping them. If you own a safe you do not get prosecuted for not opening it for them. If you keep a diary written in ancient babylonian cuneiform you do not get prosecuted if you don't translate it for them. If they ask you any (some exceptions regarding driving and identifying yourself I believe) questions other than what is the password you don't get prosecuted for remaining silent. If they come to your house with a search warrant demanding to know where x is you do not get prosecuted for not telling them where it is.

With encrypted data there are further issues; how do you tell the difference between (this is the simple version) a load of rubbish left on the hard drive after deleting a user and an encrypted file? How do you prove that the download you can't open (again simple version) isn't an encrypted file? How do you prove that the remnants of a user account from the previous owner isn't an encrypted file? 

You can be compelled to provide them with something you genuinely do not know, or doesn't even exist. This is wrong! 


**If you've got nothing to hide**

Your computer not only knows your secrets, but can also bear false witness against you. For example the guy in Bristol a while back, the one man in the world who pays for porn. Police confiscated and inspected his computer, prosecuted him for possession of child pornography. Of the terabytes of legal porn he had, somewhere on one of the sites he visited his browser's cache had picked up a couple of thumbnails the police believed to be cp. He had not saved these images, he had not intentionally sought them out, by the wording of the articles I saw they may even have since expired and been deleted by his browser. But he was prosecuted. And eventually found not guilty, but not before being dragged through the press as a pedophile. 

This man paid for porn! As far as he knew his computer was all above board. Just because you don't think you have anything to hide doesn't mean that you can't be prosecuted.

Although the house has been extended downstairs the bedrooms are really quite tiny.  After living in such a big house, we couldn’t imagine being in something even smaller.'

That is only the beginning of her problems. She is trapped in an upmarket area and forced into that rent. As she is on benefits, she will not be able to find anywhere else due to her poor credit rating and all the 'No DSS' conditions. So she can't move somewhere cheaper even if she wanted.

Regardless... 

Her benefits are about right (4 bedroom allowance is £400 a week in her area), dubious maths in the title aside.

What the article doesn't touch on though is her entitlement to Employment Support Allowance (and therefore HB). ESA is like super Jobseekers Allowance for disabled folk.

ESA can only be claimed for one year on the NI Contribution based group. Otherwise she would have to be in the Support Group. And to be in the Support Group, you are more than likely receiving Disability Living Allowance too. Which she is not. ESA is also pretty much only for the ill/disabled - otherwise you receive JobSeekers Allowance. Which the article makes no mention of.

I've no doubt she has calculated she is better off out of work, considering her skill set. But. She is claiming benefits for the ill and disabled yet is apparently seeking work. Which means, in a matter of a fact way, that she is CAPABLE OF WORK, and therefore has ZERO entitlement to ESA. There is just no way she got past ATOS. ATOS strike people off with brain injuries and no legs, yet the DM is now telling me that she just swanned straight by? Uhuh.

Other than that... living such a luxurious lifestyle previously and being in debt up to the eyeballs while an Accountant is just ludicrousness. You can protect and hide income from creditors. She was an accountant ffs, it was her job to know how to fuck these people.

&gt;'I’d got as far as putting up a website when I was hauled into the benefits office and accused of fraud

If you are receiving benefits and know they have awarded them to you incorrectly... You do not, generally, announce that to the world for that would prompt a review. She has already been investigated for... putting up a website (fuck off), so the next best course of action is to go to the Daily Mail and This Morning to tell people your story?

Not ill. On incorrect benefit entitlement. Has been investigated previously but is now drawing more attention to her work-capable behaviour and lack of disability?

I never said that what Abu Qatada has been doing is nice, or a good thing, or that I think his presence in the UK is anything other than harmful.

What I'm saying is that as a civilised society, we have to ensure that everyone is treated fairly before the eyes of the law. Even those people whose views we find unpleasant. No, *especially* those people whose views we find unpleasant.

All I was trying to say is that if we are a country that is defined by its respect for the rule of law, then we somehow need to be able to frame a law that will make certain things illegal. I was trying to make a point -- a philosophical point, not a political point -- that writing a law which restricts the right of free speech in specific ways, with no unintended consequences, is extremely difficult. So difficult that in my opinion no country or government, in all the world or in all time, has yet been able to create such a definition.

For example you say that what Abu Qatada says should be treason. Many, many people would agree with that (including much of the Government I imagine), but to prosecute him for that it needs to be written down in law. Try writing a law which catches what he says, but would let me or you off if we're down the pub having a winge and say ""bloody MPs with their expenses scandals, they should all be strung up"". Yes, it's obvious to everyone what the difference is, but the law is an emotionless bastard and rarely takes account of whether someone had a grin on their face or not.

&gt;Do you realize you're trading the identity of the UK for cheap labor?

The immigrants I hire all have at least two university degrees, sometimes three or four. They aren't cheap. 

So far as the “identity of the UK” goes (whatever that's supposed to be), I recall a talk by a _very_ committed Scottish nationalist in Edinburgh years ago. He was one of the guys who stole the Stone of Destiny form Westminster Abbey, so pretty hard-core. He was criticising the then-popular thread in Scottish nationalism of attacking, sometimes physically, so-called English settlers in Scotland, who were seen as diluting the “Scottishness” of Scotland. 

What he said was something like “the incomers may be English, but their children are Scots”. I do have a concern that this process has broken down with some immigrant groups in some places—their children are not British but something more like displaced people, born displaced. That's not good. But if we could get that back on track, fine.",0,1364455497,null,0,1364466339,0,c93wvvt,t3_1b5ya9,t1_c93wvvt,t1_c93ws84,null,1431729044,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Like you, I heard people go on about it and thought well there must be something to it.

So I downloaded the first season (2005) and watched through it - I had some free time and nothing better to do.

About 3/4ths through I was completely hooked and I realized something - Individual episodes might not be that great, but the greater story arc - some of them over multiple seasons are what pulls me into the whole experience.

Just the first two episodes will not give you a true doctor who experience - it cannot. That was just after the reboot and everyone was still floundering a bit IMO, but about halfway through I think they got their act together and by the end of it, it was amazing.

So if you want my advice - set a weekend aside and watch through the first season with Eccleston (the pic you posted) and then make up your mind - but keep in mind, it gets a lot better as the seasons go on.

If you can't get yourself to watch through it, then pick a few choice episodes from other seasons to see if you still think it sucks - my recommendations are ""Vincent and the Doctor"" and ""Blink"" - others might have different favourites.

TL;DR: The first two episodes is not a good indication of what Doctor Who is like",0,1364455690,null,0,false,0,c93wwug,t3_1b5lyb,t1_c93wwug,t3_1b5lyb,null,1431729057,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; I think it just decided one day that it was going to be leader of the pack as in the household.

That's why you don't pick dogs up. 

When training a dog it is absolutely vital that you establish yourself as the pack leader.  Not only for your safety but for the dog's happiness.  As a general rule, dogs **don't** want to be pack leader because pack leaders are the ones sticking their necks out to protect the rest of the pack.  Pack leaders literally led the pack into ""battle"" and usually got killed first.  Of course, that's not so relevant with domesticated dogs who only have to worry about the milkman, but it's all part and parcel of the pack mentality

So you shouldn't pick dogs up, let them sit on your lap, go upstairs, sleep on the bed, etc..  When you walk through a door, *you* go first and the dog must wait for you.  Same with food.  You first, dog second.  All these things establish you as the pack leader and the dog as being subservient.

If they can do those kind of things in a more cost-effective way, then that's great.

They've done this at least twice already, the first time being a guy who turned out to be schizophrenic.


What TrueCrypt provides (in theory) is plausible deniability. It allows you to provide two passwords, where one will decrypt on ""drive"" and the other password another ""drive"". 


The idea being that if really really pushed you can provide one password, which will show a drive that (hopefully) you have populated with fake data(dirty but not illegal porn?), and the other password you keep secret, along with your real secrets.

true,maby66,present,Fatty Foulkes is my hero,"Couple of things from experience with group buys in other places (car forums when buying or receiving parts from overseas, gaming clans and so on).

They are a hassle.

You will get a ton of people who all want to be included, but when the time comes to pony up the money, many keen buyers evaporate.

All money needs to be collected and paid up front. No money? No item. Whoever organises this should not be in the position of funding other peoples purchases on promises of ""payday is at the end of the week/month/year"".

Set a minimum go/no go number and stick to it.

Do the math on cost of item, cost of shipping (UK-US, US-final destinations). Add a % on top to cover extras (customs, tax, that sort of thing). Divide by number of items/people and that is final price. No negotiations. If people think they can get it cheaper, then let them.

This may assist in calculations:
http://www.dutycalculator.com/

Buying instructions should be clear and easy - item, size, delivery address and so on. No changing of mind once decision made/submitted.

Get an estimate of total despatch time for all legs of the process. Add a few days on. Add some more days on. Now you have a very rough guide to how long it will take. Publicise it and stick to it. Ignore anyone who wants updates prior to that time passing (unless you have significant news - ie items received in US/sent out for final dispatch).

Prepare for whinging! Lots of it!

All sales are final. It is not down to the person(s) who helped out by organising/buying in the UK/dispatching in the US that the lettering on yours is slightly off, or the transfer has peeled off. Thems the breaks.
If you want something you can return, buy locally/from the US site.


**Having said all that**

I'm a helpful guy.

I am prepared to be at the UK end of this on the following basis:

1) All money is paid up front

2) Single order only - no add ons/extras after initial order

3) My interaction will be limited to purchase of the agreed number of items, delivery to my address, onward dispatch to a single US address, all pre-funded as above

4) I won't be checking, returning, or otherwise dealing with anything outside of the above.

This may sound harsh, but it is based on experience and to set realistic expectations.

Cheers.

Foolish in the extreme.

Er... no.

There is some evidence to suggest that at least one government agency - the NSA in the US - is routinely 20 years ahead of the best brains in the encryption industry. Certainly [their involvement with the design of DES](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard#NSA.27s_involvement_in_the_design) was found to considerably strengthen the algorithm - but cryptographers publishing work in the public domain didn't figure this out until the early 1990's.

There are [key recovery attacks for AES](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard#Known_attacks) publicly known that are significantly faster than brute force - though they're nothing like fast enough that you could easily decrypt a container on your own PC in a reasonable time. These key recovery attacks are recent innovations - but the NSA decided back in 2003 that you'd want at least a 192-bit key for Top Secret classified information; below that and 128-bit was acceptable. 

Considering that even today, 128-bit is generally considered way overkill, why did the NSA explicitly demand 192-bit keys for Top Secret information some ten years ago? Did they know something back then? If past experience is anything to go by, it's entirely possible but we probably won't know until around 2023.

On the plus side - for most of us, there is no Earthly way anybody is going to go to convict you wholly and exclusively on the basis of evidence found in an encrypted hard drive.

The post also points out that the Samaritans' advice is to ""*Avoid simplistic explanations for suicide....although a catalyst may appear to be obvious, suicide is never the result of a single factor or event and is likely to have several inter-related causes.*""

true,YourLizardOverlord,eng-sussex,Scotland --&gt; West Sussex,"No, though those were dreadful value for money. There have been some tweaks to PFI to make it slightly less bad.

Under the new rules for the NHS, private sector companies can bid to run NHS hospitals, and the new commissioning consortia can elect to use private sector providers for elements of patient care.

On the face of it, if we didn't know better from previous privatisations, this sounds like a good thing. Free-at-the-point-of-use healthcare continues, private sector providers are only used if they can offer a cheaper or better service, and the taxpayer gets a better deal.

But it won't work like that because the private healthcare providers have too much political influence. They wouldn't have been making party donations if they didn't expect some sort of result. And with the help of McKinsey and KPMG, they have helped write the legislation and the rulebook. Private healthcare providers are already lobbying because the NHS is too cheap and they can't compete. The table will be firmly tilted towards the private sector. 

It won't help that it's difficult to measure the effectiveness of a healthcare provider. There will be a tendency as usual to game the metrics rather than deliver a quality service.

It's going to end up similar to the railways: the taxpayer will pay the capital costs, the taxpayer will underwrite the risks, the cost will dramatically increase, but some space will be found for a private company to make a profit. 

I don't think it's possible or desirable to have a true free market in healthcare, but the new legislation brings in something that's about as far from a free market as I can imagine.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; If you have insurance you don't pay at point of use!

Even with insurance you normally end up with massive excesses (hundreds of $ minimum) - maybe you don't pay this straight away but very soon after. It doesn't help that the charges are vastly inflated in relation to work performed. Insurance companies seem to ensure that you pay even though you're paying hundreds of dollars per month (even more if you want an insurance policy with a low excess)

The NHS does not do this to UK residents except for prescription/optical/dental.

&gt; Ability to pay over there is not a factor they have to treat you. 

Only in an emergency. If you went to the equivalent of a GP without insurance or money because you have some non-emergency complaint they're probably going to tell you to go away. Only once you're at risk of dying then you can go to the ER, and even then they only have to do enough to get you stable, not the works.

I would prefer the NHS system where issues can be sorted out long before they become major enough to require emergency treatment.

&gt;  In fact more so then NHS who can send you to a hospital hours away in your catchment area even though it is called a NATIONAL health system.

That's an efficient use of resources. Why have loads of hospitals with very expensive equipment and specialists doing nothing when it is more efficient to have them in fewer places and getting better utilisation.

Three months later I was bored and gave the rest of the episodes of the first season another shot. And I don't regret it.

The show grows by leaps and bounds and, while it is still campy and ridiculous at times, it gains this amazing, wonderful charm that makes you forgive it all. Even the episodes with the farting monsters (you'll get to that).

true,NEWSBOT3,cnty-uk,Londontown | Temporarily in the Colonies,"Sorry, but i dont see anything wrong with this.

The problem is that by far most beggars ARE scammers - I used to live in York which has a particular problem with them, and the councils own figures show that 85% of beggars are claiming benefits. (the source for this is printed on donation boxes in the city centre, so i cant link you to it).

If you want to genuinely help the poor, give your money to a charity that helps them, not to people in the street, where 7 out of 8 of them are taking the piss. You can even buy them food, drink etc - but giving them money just makes their situation worse, not better.

to futher my point - here's the FAQ page on begging from homeless charity Thamesreach http://www.thamesreach.org.uk/news-and-views/campaigns/giving-to-beggars/faq/

&gt;Most people who beg have accommodation. Outreach workers can help those who don't to access a hostel bed. 

and [heres](http://www.bristol.gov.uk/page/our-city-news/2012-12/giving-beggars-harms-them-warn-streetwise-staff) a Bristol charity saying that 
&gt; Giving to beggars harms them, warn Streetwise staff 
&gt; giving beggars money can stop them from taking help and will probably fund drugs or drink.

true,KarmaAndLies,null,null,"Learning to drive is hugely expensive. When I learnt it wound up costing me literally thousands to go from nothing to qualified.    

Plus even once you pass that test the financial hardships only begin for you. Fuel is hugely expensive, parking too, oh and there will be a parking warden waiting around every corner in case you make a mistake or misread a sign (£60 please!).    

Let's not even talk about £3000 for insurance for a £2000 car in the first year for someone in their mid 20s. Because that is entirely reasonable? ...     

The way insurance is structured in this country is broken. Insurance is designed to ""spread the risk"" of accidents over a large population, but insurers through no-claims-bonuses have managed to stack the system so you have new drivers paying literally thousands and old drivers with tens of years of no-claims-bonuses able to get insurance for, in some cases, under £100.    

As a direct result a lot of people are looking at the cost of driving and simply deciding not to do it. Now you can decide if this is good or bad, but ultimately as fewer and fewer people drive, driving will only increase in cost for the few who remain. Eventually someone (i.e. regulators or insurers) has to blink, otherwise they'll have a larger and large proportion of young people without a car.     

If they want driving to die then they're going the right way about it. If they want driving to continue then they need to:    

 - Cap no-claims-bonuses (e.g. 10 years).    
 - Add some kind of ""new driver program"" where you pay £3000/year but get £2000 of that back if you don't have an accident.    
 - Eliminate parking charges for high-streets, hospitals, and many other government/council run institutions (in particular public services).    
 - Stop paying for the NHS via fuel, and instead spread the cost over the population (i.e. move fuel duty into general taxation).     ",0,1364473533,null,0,false,0,c93z04d,t3_1b670v,t1_c93z04d,t3_1b670v,null,1431730190,26,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,26

true,YourLizardOverlord,eng-sussex,Scotland --&gt; West Sussex,"&gt;However, the NHS is full of vast inefficiencies and managers who get shifted sideways instead of sacked because the NHS rarely gets rid of shit people.

That's all true, though to an extent it's balanced by people who work hard because of intrinsic motivation. There are plenty of incremental improvements that could be made to the NHS. For example their office  practices are firmly stuck in the 1980s. 

But equally private sector companies are  stuffed full of inefficiencies, especially the larger ones. I've worked for enough of them to be well aware that the supposed efficiency of the private sector is a myth.

Certainly Virgin Care have complained to the regulator because Yorkshire NHS were engaged in 'predatory pricing' by forgoing profit. This doesn't sound like they plan to compete on efficiency. They want to get the table tilted their way.

true,TakenByVultures,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"&gt;I'm a student, my 2012 income put me in the lower 10% bracket of UK income.

Since you're Scottish, doesn't that mean you're getting your tuition paid for and low interest loans/grants to cover your living costs?

&gt;There's a difference between some severely disabled chap (and I love that they get wheeled out every time someone needs an argument for benefits covering 30% of our nation) getting some sheltered housing, 

'Wheeled' - I hope that was unintentional. Not all severly disabled people live in sheltered housing. Many live independently in social housing (like my mum). I know such people are probably an inconvenience to your argument/world view but thankfully we live in a compassionate society where such people aren't left to rot in institutions.

&gt;and a professional middle class couple opting for a council house because the rent is 1/3 that of a private dwelling (and yes, I've known people who fit both those examples).

Nobody 'opts' for a council house. You already know the size of the waiting list. Due to the sheer demand, eligibility criteria are tough. The middle class couple you mention would have an average ten year wait for a council house (or more likely a dingy 1 bed flat) here in Manchester (if they'd even be allowed to join the list...).

Granted, it wasn't always like this but since we're discussing present day then let's use present day eligibility criteria and not anecdotal examples.

&gt;It's unacceptable that council housing is simply being used as a way for people to save some money. People who work and lack a reason besides ""it's cheaper"" should not ever be granted places in council housing, 

Why not? Imagine this; two adults on minimum/low wage with two kids. One gets made redundant/falls ill. They can't afford their mortgage/rent anymore - they default on repayments and get booted out. What now? You expect a family of four to rent a house on a single minimum wage? Pure fantasy.

&gt;and council housing should not be a long term thing, but a 6-12 month thing where you get back on your feet.

Often it is. Often it isn't. The fact that so many are in council houses to begin with, that waiting lists are so high and rents/prices unaffordable show just how badly housebuilding policy has been fucked.

Yes indeed. I also work two jobs though.

&gt;I know such people are probably an inconvenience to your argument/world view but thankfully we live in a compassionate society where such people aren't left to rot in institutions.

Now now, you're starting to be rude. I already completely agreed that society should look after the disabled, and the vulnerable. There is a serious difference between those people and the second group of people I referenced.

&gt;Nobody 'opts' for a council house. You already know the size of the waiting list. Due to the sheer demand, eligibility criteria are tough. The middle class couple you mention would have an average ten year wait for a council house (or more likely a dingy 1 bed flat) here in Manchester (if they'd even be allowed to join the list...).

Actually the guy shoved himself on a waiting list the second he arrived to the city and within about 2 years of being a student got one, then never left, despite getting a partner and raising his income hugely.

&gt;Why not? Imagine this; two adults on minimum/low wage with two kids. One gets made redundant/falls ill. They can't afford their mortgage/rent anymore - they default on repayments and get booted out. What now? You expect a family of four to rent a house on a single minimum wage? Pure fantasy.

People who're ill get Incapacity benefit/DLA. But if you're raising two kids and paying a mortgage on minimum wage you're a bit of an idiot, frankly.

&gt;The fact that so many are in council houses to begin with, that waiting lists are so high and rents/prices unaffordable show just how badly housebuilding policy has been fucked. Social/affordable housing is the symptom, not the cause.

Frankly I'd just get rid of the whole concept. Sheltered housing for those that have to have lifelong or longterm help, sell off the council housing, use government funding to encourage new building, hell even have the government contract builders themselves and then sell the properties at cost, but we need new housing and I don't want to subsidise that for others who simply don't think they should pay.",0,1364478731,null,0,false,0,c9403st,t3_1b5dh9,t1_c9403st,t1_c93zxxr,null,1431730693,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,TakenByVultures,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"&gt;Yes indeed. I also work two jobs though.

Laughable. The guy having his housing/living costs subsidised by the state would like the same support withdrawn from others in potentially more perilous circumstances.

&gt;Now now, you're starting to be rude. I already completely agreed that society should look after the disabled, and the vulnerable. There is a serious difference between those people and the second group of people I referenced.

And you're downright offensive. Your idea of looking after is to stick them all in sheltered housing. That's a stones throw from insititutionalisation and something any modern democracy should be ashamed of.

&gt;Actually the guy shoved himself on a waiting list the second he arrived to the city and within about 2 years of being a student got one, then never left, despite getting a partner and raising his income hugely.

Which city? His income went from what to what?

&gt;People who're ill get Incapacity benefit/DLA. But if you're raising two kids and paying a mortgage on minimum wage you're a bit of an idiot, frankly.

Crystall balls haven't been invented yet. I said minimum/low wage. My girlfriend's parents were earning 20k each 15 years ago. Due to a series of redundancies (northern mill town - industry decimated in the 80's), they're both now on little more than minimum wage - thankfully, they've just finished paying off their mortgage but it was a huge struggle and not for lack of hard work. 

&gt; use government funding to encourage new building, hell even have the government contract builders themselves and then sell the properties at cost, 

Agreed. I thought you were for less intervention though - not more?

&gt;but we need new housing and I don't want to subsidise that for others who simply don't think they should pay.

You think you *know* the motivation of those who end up living in social housing, and as I said earlier - it's a negative and disingenuous assumption to make.

This is not the case. You have either not read my posts properly or you intentionally misrepresent them. Either way, stop.

Firstly, my housing costs are not being subsidised, I have a loan. I will pay this back in full over the next few years. Secondly, I'm unhappy about people who are not in dire straits or extreme poverty living in subsidised housing, not those in ""more perilous"" circumstances. I've made this quite clear. If you continue to misrepresent my position in your posts then there is no further point to our conversation.

&gt;And you're downright offensive. Your idea of looking after is to stick them all in sheltered housing. That's a stones throw from insititutionalisation and something any modern democracy should be ashamed of.

I suggest we stick those who require serious help from the state in some form of sheltered housing, yes. Those who are capable of looking after themselves in their own house should do so, they should not be in houses owned by the rest of us which they pay 1/3 the money we all pay.

&gt;Which city?

Aberdeen. Why?

&gt;Crystall balls haven't been invented yet. I said minimum/low wage. My girlfriend's parents were earning 20k each 15 years ago. Due to a series of redundancies (northern mill town - industry decimated in the 80's), they're both now on little more than minimum wage - thankfully, they've just finished paying off their mortgage but it was a huge struggle and not for lack of hard work.

Hard work is assumed, not something for which a pat on the head should be expected. Yes, crystal balls haven't been invented, but people should take responsibility for their lives and have savings to cover redundancy. There will always be people for whom any level of preparation is insufficient and the government should aid these people, but for the average person they should be capable of looking after themselves.

&gt;Agreed. I thought you were for less intervention though - not more?

I have no issue with government intervention in building policy or even building. I have an issue with middle income families paying £200-300 a month rent on two bedroom flats when the rest of us are paying £500-600 on 1 beds.

&gt;You think you know the motivation of those who end up living in social housing, and as I said earlier - it's a negative and disingenuous assumption to make.

You claim I think I know the motivation of *all* (that would be a stupid claim as it's obviously false) or that I've known the motivations of some (which would be true)?

&gt;For many it's not that they don't think they should pay, it's that they can't.

Yes, I know. I've already addressed this, housing should be available to those who absolutely can not afford it.

But. I do want to know how to drive and will eventually get on it. It would be nice to head back to the North at a moments notice without advance booking a train. However, I don't know if I will ever own a car, it would just take too much of my income which can be better used for savings and holidays.

This is important, most of us will be happy to hear Gerrard wants to stay on and we hope he keeps driving us forward but the honest truth is he will eventually start to lose his ability and for some players they think they are the exception to the rule and they'll never lose the level they once played at, I pray it doesnt happen but his status may make managers reluctant to put him on the bench when he does eventually slow down not to mention he may be taking crucial playing time away from the player that will help drive us forward once he' gone

Having met him a few times is the only evidence I personally can trust - it's not the most objective evidence, sure, nor is it diverse. But it's as good as I have, and having watched him also in Commons debates and followed his career as closely as I can, I'm not making assumptions either.

I do not think the best politicians are the ones who 'have the guts to go for the top job'. Ambition, whilst an effective way of ensuring one gives 100%, is not a guarantee for success. Instead, the better politicians, and employees in general - in my opinion - are those who are sensible, make well-calculated decisions, are pragmatic and are knowledgeable.

So, whilst Mr. Miliband may lack ambition and passion, I think a quieter, more reserved politician would do UK government good. Rather than shouting passionately about political theory and moral debates (Cameron, Ed Miliband, Blair, Thatcher), this country needs a politician who can get on with the job sensibly, practically and successfully.

I then hear him shouting ""You fucking deaf twat!"", at which point I turn round and completely lose my rag at him. I ask why he should expect anything from anyone with an attitude like that and that he should stay in Exeter if he loves it so much.

He tried it again with me a couple of weeks later, I told him I thought he wouldn't want money from deaf twats like me.

My other favourite story is the beggar asking for money under North Cross, with a massive bottle of whiskey under one arm freshly nicked from the nearby Sainsburys.

So yeah, thanks to these experiences I never give to the (wo)man on the street. There's normally city-wide collection boxes for local homeless charities - you're much better putting your money there.

The point I admittedly have not made here, but have elsewhere in the thread, is that the technical realities of encryption means that the 'just use a hidden volume' advise is bad. A file which is encrypted looks like random data. A file which is encrypted with a hidden volume along with a normal encrypted volume (I'm describing that badly I know) looks like random data (caveats apply).

If you use an application which has the ability to encase a hidden volume in an encrypted file that would seem reasonable cause to suspect that any encrypted file may contain one.

Should there be any circumstantial evidence to suggest that you would have a hidden volume in there, even if you don't, you could conceivably be charged with this offense. As an example, if your browsing history yields your reddit username, and you've advised people to use hidden volumes, yet the normal encrypted file does not contain the data the police are searching for.

Most public transportation in cities is good, cheap and reliable. If you live in the suburbs though or in the countryside, I can imagine the appeal of a car is definitely more attractive, even necessary.  

I did start to learn to drive when I was 17 but gave up as I went to university and could no longer afford the lessons. Now that I'm 25 I'm really regretting making that decision, I wish I had carried on and got my full license. 

At the moment I don't really have the need for a car as I live in London and the public transport here is great, but there are certain moments where a car would be absolutely amazing e.g. 

* Transporting large goods/purchases that would be a pain to carry on the bus or train
* Waking up and being able to just jump into the car to go to places (beach/out to the country etc) on a whim
* Being able to drive a car when abroad
* Repaying the favour to your mates when giving lifts

In reality, there aren't enough smaller houses for people to move to, and if there are, you can't move at the drop of a hat (and moving costs you too). The rules about how many bedrooms you are allowed depend on the ages and genders of your children, so the house you are in now might be ""too big"", but in a year or two when your kids get older it will be permitted (and necessary) to have that number of rooms.

Councils are also allowed to define a downstairs reception room as a bedroom if they feel like it.

There are all manner of special cases, eg due to the special needs of disabled people, which probably won't be taken into account properly.

All this means that this scheme will just result on low income households having even less money, rather than actually solving a problem.

Spurs on the other hand have everything to play for, so don't get too frustrated if things don't go our way, it is quite likely.

A ships them to person B in the US.
A is now down £380.

When they arrive?
What is the time lag between chasing for payment and realising that payment isn't happening?
How can A get a refund if the shirts are in the US?

I've been watching PL for 6 years, and had no team that I really supported. When Laudrup took over I was interested, and they had really won me over with their tactics. I started watching them every week, following blogs, etc. I have a hard time calling myself a ""supporter"" for really one reason. They are a club who has seen some difficult times, and I'm a fan who has not been there for any of them. I'd hate to upset any Jacks who have been there through thick and thin or come off as plastic.

That all being said, here are my $.02:

Watch the whole team, try paying particular attention to passing and how they set up movements. Watch for trouble they might have making easy passes in the final third, and also watch their defensive movement (they have a superb defense). Michu is of course great to watch, but if you haven't seen a game you might be expecting him to hang out a bit further up the pitch than he tends to. Just realized you said you have limited exposure to soccer in general. That being said just watch how they work as a team and try to figure out what different players' roles are on the pitch. Try to figure out what the Swansea players are *trying to do* also, are they trying to play slowly and wait for an error? Are they trying to push forward quickly and force one? Just try to watch their tempo, how far they are passing, where most of their passing happens, how the defense clears the ball (long passes down the field, or short passes out of the defense?). If you can remember all of this, also watch Tottenham players like Defoe and Bale, and see how Swansea tries to counter this.

Really no way to watch it incorrectly, in my opinion, but since you're new I would say it'd be good to try figuring out what they players are really doing.",0,1364485504,null,0,false,0,c94247q,t3_1b6akr,t1_c94247q,t3_1b6akr,null,1431731654,5,false,swanseacity,t5_2tip4,5

I'd even go so far as to say if all the monies were collected on the US side before hand, and proof offered from an agreed third party, I'd make the purchase first on condition money was transferred over immediately after I proved I'd made the purchase.

It would also mean less time to wait for people to get the item they've paid for, as the shipment from UK to US would be pretty much as soon as purchased/received in the UK, as not having to wait for monies in the US to be collected. 

My suggestion would be:

Full amount paid (following calculation of unit price including shipping etc) to trusted person on US side.

Money held on US side - proof provided to UK member.

UK member buys shirts and provides proof of purchase/shipping info.

(possible intermediary step - UK member provides proof of shirts arriving?)

US funds are transferred to UK member.

UK member ships to US and provides tracking info.

US distributor recieves shipment.

US members pay US distributor for local shipping costs.

US distributor sends out single shipments as shippings costs are paid for.

Which pilots? You need to be clear here, the pilots doing SAR from land in Britain for the coastguard will be gone.

The pilots on ships are already doing the training they do, and nothing will change with them. The division of helicopters between SAR and the Fleet Air Arm is already relatively separate, since they're largely flying different vehicles.

&gt;If they are not performing real civilian rescues they will need to perform fake training rescues, needlessly putting everyone involved in danger.

Again, they're different people doing different jobs. Is there a possibility that having fewer SAR capable helicopter pilots will put peoples lives at risk? Sure, of course, but the nation wants the military cut and so the military is being cut.

&gt;To be honest I think the whole thing is an embarrassment.

Well, support military spending then, and let your MP know that you do.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Just a quick thing (not meant to be rude) but a ""public"" school in the UK is actually a fee-paying school (stupid I know). Our ""public"" schools are comprehensive schools. Just so you know.

I'm taking history for A level. I've done it all the way through school, but it does vary depending on what courses your school choose. I remember doing stuff like WW2 and the Blitz at a young age, and The Tudors, both in primary school.

Then between years 7-9 we did Roman civilization, World War 1 &amp; 2, then British history such as the Magna Carta and the rise in democracy. Oliver Cromwell and the Civil war as well as a bit of early American history - the slave trade, a brief mention of the war of independence &amp; civil war. Oh, we also learned a bit about the government system in the UK and America (but that may be because I was in the top class and our teacher just loved discussing stuff with us).

Although between years 7-9, the school can interpret the curriculum in different ways within the specifications. This is part of [the curriculum](http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/teachingandlearning/curriculum/secondary/b00199545/history/programme/range) as set out by the government:

&gt; British history
d. the development of political power from the Middle Ages to the twentieth century, including changes in the relationship between rulers and ruled over time, the changing relationship between the crown and parliament, and the development of democracy
e. the different histories and changing relationships through time of the peoples of England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales
f. the impact through time of the movement and settlement of diverse peoples to, from and within the British Isles
g. the way in which the lives, beliefs, ideas and attitudes of people in Britain have changed over time and the factors – such as technology, economic development, war, religion and culture – that have driven these changes
h. the development of trade, colonisation, industrialisation and technology, the British Empire and its impact on different people in Britain and overseas, pre-colonial civilisations, the nature and effects of the slave trade, and resistance and decolonisation


Then at GCSE, it depends which exam board your school does, but I personally studied Germany from 1919-1939 (basically Weimar through to Hitler's war-mongering), the Cold War (1945-1992), Post-war America (1950-1990) and Ireland &amp; the IRA. (1900ish - present). 

A level is the same, it depends on which exam board, but I am currently studying the Causes and events of the French Revolution (1780-1795) and British politics - Liberals &amp; Conservatives (1835-1892). I can't remember what I study next year, but I'm fairly sure one of the units is on American history.

Tl;dr: It's mandatory up until year 9/8th grade. We mainly focus on ancient history (romans, egyptians, etc.), post-medieval history/beginning of Britain today (The Tudors, Civil War etc.) and modern history (World War 2). But if you take it further it can be pretty much anything. ",0,1364500105,null,0,1364504669,0,c946pta,t3_1b70oy,t1_c946pta,t3_1b70oy,null,1431747922,6,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,6

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Firstly, as I've said elsewhere, this isn't a privitisation of the armed forces, they're simply having one of their roles taken away from them.

If you take away a role that has been a military role and award it to a private company, that is literally the definition of privatisation, you can have an opinion on whether it's a good thing but you cannot argue that it is not the correct terminology.

&gt;Second, given the government's determination to cut both troop numbers and the defence budget, the RAF can simply not afford the new helicopters it would require. That is, if the RAF even exists in 5-10 years.
&gt;
&gt;Thirdly, I'd happily support an increase in our funding for the armed forces to £40 billion, however that isn't going to happen and it's more important to have the capability in the RAF to defend our skies than to rescue drowning sailors.

Then you should be opposing cuts in all their forms and more importantly you should read up on what happened to the US military if you want to see what's coming in terms of privatisation. Those of us in can already see it happening.

The situation with regards to funding is shitty, but if we're to accept the starting point of funding as it is, then we need to look at ways of making that funding work. The common replacement for Sea King's is NH90's, they're about £25-30 million each. We currently have a fleet of 24 Sea Kings. To replace 1 for 1, that's £600 million minimum just to keep going a like for like search and rescue capability not including the high long term costs of maintaining helicopters, support crew, pilots, and so on and so forth.

The government feels that this can be done more cheaply be people with less varied skillsets who will be cheaper, which makes sense.

Also, they can't do a CRB check on you without your permission, although it doesn't sound like it'll be necessary for this job.  If they say they're going to do one, don't let them find out about your conviction from that, tell them what to expect and explain the situation.

true,Seismica,cnty-uk,Teesside,"Unlimited is the opposite of limited. By definition, a limit imposed on a connection means that it is not unlimited.

The adverts highlight download speeds, which is a limit yes, but that isn't totally relevant as the advertised speeds are limited by the infrastructure they have in place (Let's not get into how bullshit the 'up to' claims can be). As G_Morgan says, nobody expects infinite download speed, we can only get the speeds that their infrastructure can support.

If we take your example; a 30Mb/s connection for £30/month. No normal user would expect to use this amount of data constantly. I don't have any sources, but I would guestimate that an average user utilises only around 2-5% of the theoretical maximum data that their contract allows (Which is 30\*60\*60\*24\*28 = 72,576,000 Mb of data for the shortest month, or roughly 9 Terabytes theoretical maximum). In the past, ISPs imposed limits on the data you can download in a month. This was unfair as if you have a limit at the end of the month, the advertised speed is redundant as the actual speed you get on average over the course of a month can only be a small fraction of that.

You seem to believe that the term 'unlimited data' only applies to the total data. Well, you are wrong. The advertised speed also becomes redundant and theoretically unachievable if the ISP throttles your speed at peak times. This is a limit imposed, beyond the restrictions of the physical infrastructure. Therefore the connection is not unlimited at all, it is being actively limited by the ISP. This is not reasonable, and no customer should expect an ISP to mislead the customer in this way.",0,1364502750,null,0,1364504080,0,c947mp3,t3_1b63sb,t1_c947mp3,t1_c941z2k,null,1431747492,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

In fact theres a british citizen in Guantanamo whos been there 11 years but been cleared for release by the US and the UK want him to return to Britain but the US want to return him to the UAE.

Whenever I see Baracks face I think about his quote in his book which is a thinly veiled hate of us Brits when hes recalling his grand father being beaten by British soldiers in Kenya - I cant help wonder about all the future grand sons discussing their treatment by American soldiers. 

Well the ones that didnt get disappeared in the Egyptian and Polish CIA black prisons let alone Guantanamo.

There are literally hundreds of thousands of future grandsons who will discuss their treatment by American soldiers the same way Barack did except all these operations in Libya, lebannon, Pakistan, iraq, afghanistan and Iran are getting his seal of approval.

* In the north of England families with a spare room outnumber overcrowded families by three to one so thousands will be hit by the bedroom tax despite there being no local need for them to move. The mismatch between people living in overcrowded homes who need to swap with those who have a spare room works only on paper and nationally. In reality, to make it work you would have to move thousands of families thousands of miles.

* If those people do choose to move there are simply not enough smaller social homes available for all 660,000 households affected by the bedroom tax to move to, and If everyone affected did decide to move, many would have to go into the more expensive private rented sector, which would mean in some cases housing benefit claims could actually increase.
   
* Meanwhile, if disabled people in adapted properties moved into smaller homes this could also cost the taxpayer millions more in costly home adaptations. Some 77 per cent of people on Disability Living Allowance live in the social housing sector and two thirds of the people hit by the bedroom tax are disabled. Around 100,000 households live in properties adapted for their needs, some through local authority grants at an average cost of £6,000.

Cooking chicken breasts are easy:

1.  Heat a little oil up to a high temp in a pan with a lid.

1.  Dust chicken breast with a little salt, pepper, plain flour and dried herbs to taste.

1.  Turn heat to medium and cook with chicken breast for two minutes, turning occasionally.

1.  Turn the heat down to low and cover the pan and leave for ten minutes.

You should now have nicely cooked chicken breasts, you can slice them into chunks in the pan and pour in a little Sharwood's etc curry sauce then pop the lid back on and let it simmer on low for 30+ minutes.

You can do something similar with diced beef, however for the typical lean cuts of diced beef, reduce the initial cooking time a bit and increase the simmering time in the sauce.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; I think you'll find that the high price is specifically designed to discourage use (high use anyway) since their networks are inadequate and they do not wish to invest the requisite funds to make it so.

There is only so far you can go with the spectrum and resources you have. At the time Orange was charging that it's was probably during the mostly 2G days where there wasn't much data capacity and where voice was more important. Even if it was 3G, Orange was on the hook for £4 billion in spectrum licence fees (I'd assume it is renegotiated now), they aren't going to get that back without charging money to use it.

&gt; Their network is already a sunk cost, it exists already. Using capacity on your existing infrastructure for profit is prudent. The thing here is that we are assuming the network has capacity.

It's not a sunk cost. The only thing that is truly sunk is some of the equipment. They still have to:

* lease space on towers and buildings for cell sites and infrastructure (or pay for their maintenance if they own them), and if they own the cell site then they have to rent space from the landowner
* they have to pay for electricity for all of their sites, 
* for the interconnects between cell sites and their network, 
* for continual upgrades - e.g. 3G equipment at the time, LTE today
* salaries for staff to run the network
* spectrum licence payments
* probably more stuff than that

These are all ongoing costs.

It's not as if once the network is built it's simply pure profit from there on in.

I should point out that I actually did say that I wasn't disagreeing with the OP - Orange probably was making a ton of money from that £1 - but that to say ""it's 0.1p"" without taking into account any of the costs of running the mobile network is quite disingenuous and you see it all the time on Reddit.",0,1364507876,null,0,1364508087,0,c949cjb,t3_1b63sb,t1_c949cjb,t1_c945auw,null,1431746684,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

First things first: if you decide to actually look *inside* a place then spend the £3 on the land registry online getting a copy of the title of the property. It will show you when it was last purchased and for how much. If anything on the title looks suspicious *run away*. That includes: leasehold remaining under 90 years, just purchased a month ago, purchased a year ago for half the price, etc.

Next: be prepared to do a *lot* of looking. This phase of your life will consume many whole weekends. Sometimes you'll find a great place but discover it got snapped up the weekend it was listed. Sometimes you'll find places that haven't sold for the last year and the owner clearly has no intention of seriously selling. You don't want to get ripped off and it might take you a while before you get a feel of when you're getting a reasonable deal.

Third: www.rightmove.co.uk and property bee are your friends. Property Bee is a plugin for Firefox.

Fourth: neighbours. One of the most difficult things about living are your neighbours. Are they noisy? Is it a carpark? Worse: is it a public carpark where teenagers will do donuts at 3am in the morning? Is there a river within 100m (expect sky-high insurance premiums if there is). Don't be afraid to throw lots of £3's at the Land Registry online site to snoop on the neighbours. You want to find good neighbours. Oh and Google Maps satellite view and street view. They are going to become your best friends. Take your time exploring online - because it's more efficient than getting in your car to visit.

Fifth: got a mortgage ""agreement-in-principle"" yet? Don't even bother looking until you've got one. Really. It's pointless. Getting a mortgage is hard - so find someone that will lend to you *first* otherwise you're wasting your time and the sellers' time.

Sixth: conveyancing - I'm so annoyed I chose an ""online conveyancer"". They advertised they would be communicative by phone and e-mail. They weren't. My conveyancer simply ignored the phone for days and wouldn't reply to e-mails for weeks - and sometimes not at all.

&gt;The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in **Europe or North America** shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.

That tiny bit there was added in specifically to stop France and the United Kingdom from using NATO to keep control of their empires. The principle of NATO is self defence. 'If you need help to defend yourself, we're here. If you want to go off on some military adventure, well don't ask us for help'. The Falklands, unfortunately, falls into the category of colony/empire so whilst not only being explicitly against the geographical restrictions of Article Five, it is also sort of against the principles of Article Five in that the clause is designed to stop the UK from keeping control of places like the Falklands.

true,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"The reason NATO forces are in Afghanistan is because NATO can be invoked *if a member of NATO is attacked in Europe or North America*. The USA (a NATO member) was attacked on 11th September 2001. This meant NATO could and was invoked to retaliate that act of war from a non state actor. Some of the grounds for war were slightly dubious, but not that dubious.

However, orbitalia did explain that quite poorly.

Additionally, here's Article Five of NATO for evidence:

&gt;The Parties agree that an armed **attack against** one or more of them in **Europe or North America** shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such **action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.**

I'd like to also point out that Afghanistan is juxtaposed with Iraq. The UK and USA were pretty much the only Western powers to invade Iraq.  The rest of the West was not obliged to because no NATO member had or has been since, attacked by any one related to Iraq. So any state which partook in the Invasion of Iraq, did so under free will and not by an obligation to NATO.

It's not the biggest contributor to the success of my professional career, but it certainly has helped open more options for me about where I can work.

I'm sure I would figure a way to survive without my car and I have no doubt I would save a significant amount of cash, but to be honest I'm at that stage in my life where my time is just as valuable to me as money. The convenience of being able to get from A to B on my own schedule and usually in a shorter amount of time than on public transport makes it worth the additional cost of running a car. 

I'd love to live in a city like Hong Kong where my family is originally from. The public transport there is truly more convenient and cost effective than having a car. In the UK, I think the benefits match the costs if you  use your car to support important aspects of your life.

true,IntellegentIdiot,flair5,,"&gt;I don't really know how you can say the Inter match doesn't count

Because it wasn't a league match and it won't make a difference to where we finish in the league

&gt;If you're going to say recent results are in our favor but then generally discard the recent results we have had, it makes little sense. 

I didn't discard the last two games but it would be a fallacy to believe those two games were predictors of our future performance. If you only take the last two games into account then I assume you were expecting us to win every game this season after we beat Arsenal on the basis that we'd won the previous two games? 

&gt;Our overall form this season has shown that we are more likely to gain points than Arsenal, but that would be nonsensical too. 

That would be a perfectly reasonable suggestion, not at all nonsensical. If you exclude the first month or two we've had a very good season

I appreciate that fans are emotional and superstitious and Spurs fans probably more so. I know in their minds we're only going to get 5 more points this season and Arsenal are going to win every game but the only reason for believing this is that they ""knew"" it was going to happen and it's last season all over again and we always bottle it (even though the evidence suggests otherwise).

Well, you say that, but:

This is what you also said.

If China ends up overtaking the UK in terms of Arms production, it will allow them to drive more money into it; thus making better arms for better prices; allowing countries like NK, Iran and Syria to purchase better arms.

It can put a fire inside the players and make them want to turn it around and smash the next opponent, or it could make the wither and lose any confidence.  Even though we got through, that loss certainly 'counts' in regards to how our squad could perform.  


The last few matches are the only indicators we have, with the most recent matches being most important.  We could say that we picked up 4 points from United this season, but what does that matter regarding the next few matches?  

You can't judge a full season on what the former 3/4 of it have been.  We did the exact same thing last year and years past, and that obviously didn't turn out.

We need Mikel to get some more playing time and those two should be able to cover the midfield adequately. ~~Put in Lamps in the last 20 mins for confidence, but we should rest him for United, Lampard has a good track record in the FA cup.~~ start Lampard. 

Attacking mid is a tough call, but I would like to see Oscar CA, Hazard out left and Moses out right. Mata is by far our most important player and should be rested for United. Oscar, Hazard and Moses SHOULD be enough to take on Southampton especially when you take into account Eden's form atm. However should we be lost as we usually are without the little Spaniard, bring on Mata in the second half. 

Striker at this point is pretty irrelevant imo since neither are really performing well. I think we should be able to handle Southampton, so I think Torres should start and save Ba for United.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;The issue there should be solved by anti-monopoly regs though Dog, not one part of the community forcing their views on another part of the community.

I agree that it's a bit authoritarian for one part of the community to deny access to services another part of the community desires, the degree to which it is depends on the groups' relative sizes, the extent to which the lack of access harms them, and the harms which are likely to arise if free access is given.  Your initial argument seemed to be that free access to these services wasn't harmful to the group which wished to restrict access, I was endeavouring to show that it likely was - and this means that it might said to be similarly authoritarian for one group of the community to force these externalities on the other section of the community by demanding to have a large multinational supermarket locally with all the attendant consequences.  

The problem with approaching these harms through the avenue of anti-monopoly regulations is evidently the regulatory capture which has allowed the massive expansion of such monopolies, duopolies, oligopolies under corporate capitalism.

2)We don't know yet. Although I am thinking the Great Intelligence shown in the Christmas special is a good suspect at this point. Moffat has promised us answers soon.

3) The Mondasian Cybermen always existed in our universe. The Cybus Cybermen were from an alternate universe. Those are the ones that were sucked into the void.

4) Unknown. Possibly the cracks from season 5 as they did eat away reality.

5.) The Time Lock was hinted to be put in place because the Time War was so horrible it could destroy everything. It is also implied that the use of Time Travel as a weapon may have created the Time Lock itself. A comic shows the Doctor recreating the De Mat gun and using it to Time Lock the Medusa Cascade, so there are a few answers. The Time War was so bad the Time Lords recalled every Time Lord who ever lived, even the dead ones as we see Rassilon and the Master, to fight in it.

true,FaggotCaterpillar,BR,brazil,"To be fair, the rest of the Brazilian team doesn't do so well either, and we have sucked recently (I'm Brazilian and admit our team has been shit since the last world cup). I think Neymar get's a bad rap because he is the star of the team and the only striker we have that's better than decent. Every game he gives his all and some games he is the only one trying. He'll come all the way back to defense to try to win the ball as well as of course being the primary creative outlet up front. One minute he's tackling some guy on the right wing, next minute he's nutmegging some guy on the left. Then the team lose 1-0 and people point fingers at him for not scoring, even though the midfield played like shit and the defense was sloppy. Just think about it: a 21 year old kid has and has had the entire weight and responsibility of Brazil's 5-world-cup-winning history on his shoulder with a mediocre team behind him and a world cup AT HOME approaching.

I agree that Hazard is better right now, but Neymar is absolutely amazing and if he played for a team of Chelsea's caliber I'm positive he'd prove his worth and get at least a few dribbles/nutmegs/passes/chapeus (not sure what you call it in English, when you flick the ball over the player in front of you and catch it on the other side) per game, plus some goals. Maybe not immediate (since he is pretty weak and English football is very physical) but within a year or two he could be one of the best players on the team. 

Sorry for the rant, I just really feel like Neymar gets a bad reputation from people that don't watch him play, ""...but he plays for a weaker league and he dives a lot."" Yes he plays for a weaker league, and he is dominating it just like any world class player would, and he does dive every now and then (plus the fact that he's very frail) but so does Suarez, Bale, and half of Barcelona.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"1. By physically coming into contact with a paradox (the living robot Doctor), that undid the time loop. That's pseudoscience. Because the fixed point was the robot Doctor dying.

2. Unknown who blew up the TARDIS but we might assume the Silence. The Pandorica was supposedly made by the coalition of aliens. Rory wasn't ""revived"". He was copied and they made a robot version. When the universe rebooted, the human Rory was back (why he remembered the events of the Big Bang, I've no idea).The Doctor reappeared at Amy's wedding because she brought him into existence. It's reverse logic: you can't remember something that doesn't exist. Therefore, if Amy remembers the Doctor, he exists.

3. The Cybermen were never gone. The ones destroyed in series 2 were alternate universe Cybermen. The original Cybermen from our universe that have been around since the classic series are Cybermen from Mondas, Earth's sister planet that drifted away. The ones we see in Moffat-era are Mondasian Cybermen. The ones underground were from a damaged ship iirc.

4. Nobody seems to remember major events that happen in ""present"" day all. the. time. Throughout the whole show. We assume it's done through denial, calling them ""hoaxes"", gov't coverups, conspiracies, etc. etc.

5. The time lock has removed Gallifrey and the Time War from our universe. And time. It's somewhere separate from all that. Perhaps in the Void, which 10 calls ""hell"", or in some other non-existent area of the multiverse. There's no real science to it. Exactly how the Doctor time locked the Time War is unknown and not spoken of in classic or new Who. Expanded universe media says that the Doctor used something called ""the Moment"" to do it but that's as specific as it gets.

Congress has used its spending oversight authority both to forbid the White House from financing trials of Guantánamo captives on U.S. soil and to block the acquisition of a state prison in Illinois to hold captives currently held in Cuba who would not be put on trial -- a sort of Guantánamo North. The current defense bill now before Congress not only reinforces these restrictions but moves to mandate military detention for most future al Qaeda cases unless the president signs a waiver.

Fair enough.  Obama originally was making statements against war but in favor of sanctions; recently, however, he has become more belligerent.

&gt;and the fact their country is capitalism on steroids more so.

Obama wanted a single-payer health care system, but opposition from Congress drove him to favor a mandatory health insurance plan with subsidies for the poor and an expansion of Medicaid, a program that provides health care to very poor people, as well as reforms that protect consumers from denial of coverage (e.g., a ban on the practice of insurance companies not covering pre-existing conditions).  He also set up a new federal department that was tasked with protecting consumers from abusive credit card practices and saved one of the nation's largest and most influential labor unions by rescuing the US auto industry.

It makes it easier for the uninsured to receive health care through Medicaid.  However, the conservative Supreme Court ruled that states could opt out of that expansion.  Republican states have done so.  Obama can't reverse the Supreme Court.  It simply isn't possible in our system.

true,justnono,null,null,"I would go and actually read how our student loans system works. The new system gives students more money than the old system did. Now you get s loan for the fees , non means tested and a living loan ,means tested. Those on low incomes get grants and part time students now qualify for loans. It's also worth noting how the loans work is not as a commercial loan. You only pay back if you are earning money (9% on income over 22k) So in effect it works as a tax would, rather than a loan would. Personally I think the new system is better as when I went you got one loan for fees and living and it only really covered fees Checkout the student finance England website it explains in more detailn. EMAs for 16-18 year-olds were slashed (up to 30 quid a week for going to college) and replaced with a system that still gives cash to some poor but less ( They now get one off payments for stuff) this to my mind is slightly worse. 

The NHS is facing issues of privatisation buy it always is be it OPUs under labor. It's kind of important when considering politics in the UK to remember that all but the most extreme and mostly unelectable politicians support the. well fair system to some extent. (Won't stop some using apparent work shy poor as a lightning rod to distract from other problems though)

Personally I find the Falklands debate here a little off, I think part of the issue is people feel we helped out the US in Afghanistan/Iran and feel we are owed however you should never buy a pint for someone expecting one back. However not supporting self determination for one region while being a war for it in another is a little strange.  Also try not to worry about it too much most people believe your president has power and few know this is severely limited if his party don't control the senate and congress.  That and this is reddit discussion is rarely balanced on emotional issues like this. 

It's also worth noting for further discussion you may engge in all of the uks big parties left and right stand together on this.

1. Just because something has happened before doesn't mean that it was good, or has to be inevitable.

3. The US isn't an empire. This isn't an argument against your central point, but against this one:

&gt;You did as we do, the Romans did as we do and maybe soon the Chinese will do as we do. 

As it is not an empire, the US experiences different social pressures, and occupies an entirely different international role. It seems rather unlikely that these different pressures will lead to an identical declining arc - it is fair more reasonable to acknowledge that entirely different factors will bring about a different result.

true,quenishi,null,null,"Register your interest with all the local estate agents, and let them know specifically what you're looking for. You'll get close to first dibs on stuff - the bottom end of the market can be fast-moving, so sometimes you do need to know what's going to end up on rightmove before it gets there. Estate agents are good for filtering like ""room to park two cars"" and other things that aren't exactly searchable. 

If you get the property briefings sent to you by the estate agent, ensure to read them first, so you don't waste time looking at stuff that isn't suitable. Most estate agents seem to be pretty good at getting it right, but some don't (I'm looking at you, House Hut). Also you can have a look at most houses on Google Maps before you visit. Can save a trip if there's something awful on the other side of the road that the estate agent isn't showing. 

Seconding getting a mortgage in principle. Get one for your house budget. 

Don't get fixated on a property until the switching of the keys. There is a chance of getting gazumped. Happened to me once, was a small bidding war, and the other people bid more than the house was really worth in the end, so we gave that one up. 

If you can, bring someone experienced. If you don't have anyone experienced, someone with a critical eye will help. Useful to have someone who is not really involved so they can point out any flaws they see/find. 

Learn where the local council estates are. Be aware of potential issues if moving onto one. Also newer houses tend to have smaller rooms than older ones, so you may want to prioritise viewings based on this fact, if it bothers you. 

Be prepared to redecorate. ""In need of modernisation"" might be too much work (usually means something like in need of central heating and most likely needs rewiring), but don't expect a house-to-go. Lotta houses in the area I was looking were all ""old couple"" decorated. With this caveat, don't turn down a house if redecorating can fix a problem. 

Also visit a house as much as you can before buying. Ensure it's what you really want in an area you like before making offers. On the offers front, get a feel for what stuff is worth so you don't end up overpaying for a house that isn't worth it.",0,1364549108,null,0,false,0,c94k0ry,t3_1b7f11,t1_c94k0ry,t3_1b7f11,null,1431741570,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Any time you might have asked me that question over the last few months my answer would probably have depended on our most recent result as I tend to think with my heart.  After a defeat I am doom and gloom, after a 5-0 spanking of somebody I feel 10 feet tall.  The reality is, it is too soon to judge.  

As an 67yr-old fan in the BBC story says, there was a failure to trust the manager in the summer transfer window and yes, he has made a few errors himself too, but I believe there is evidence that Brendan is learning.  Let's remember - he is young for a manager, this is his biggest test to date, and he is having to continue to learn as he goes along.

I hail from the same part of the world as Brendan.  I too grew up the son of a Liverpool-supporting father but sentiment will not cloud my judgement any more than it will FSG's.  He must be given as much financial support this summer as we can realistically manage and given the chance to demonstrate next season that he is the man to help us move back towards champions league football.  If however, he does not hold out the hope before the end of this calendar year that we can challenge for top 4, then we may have to reassess the situation and change manager again.  Success is not necessarily being in the top 4, but holding out the hope that we can do it.  That is a hope we have not had for 2 to 3 years now and any movement in that direction must be judged to be progress.

Lastly, for all that he talks crap sometimes, there is something about him that reminds me a little bit about Shankly, who, let's remember, took charge when we were not even in the top division and made us world-beaters.",0,1364549690,null,0,false,0,c94k2ux,t3_1b8bgm,t1_c94k2ux,t3_1b8bgm,null,1431741543,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9

true,Wand3rer,uk,Cambridge,"This is sure to get buried, but as a US/Latin American expat living in the UK, I'd like to respond to some of the US hate in this thread. 

Specifically regarding the Falklands 'snub' some of you seem to be going nuts over. The US has interests in Latin America - interests that would be jeopardized by explicitly coming out in support of your claim on the Falklands. Especially so close to the death of Chavez in Venesuela, a country with which - superficially at least - Argentia has 'freind and ally' status. In a regional political climate of such instability, US foreign policy goals have to be not to stir the pot any more than it has been, especially when it comes to issues that open the old wounds of colonialism on the continent; wounds that for many have never closed. US support for England on an issue that has been characterised as colonial action by the ""resurgent British Empire"" will do nothing for the US, besides satisfy a bunch of over-sensitive whiners in England that have no understanding of how foreign policy works, or are exploiting anti-US sentiment to score political points, and, in the absence of this manufactured Falklands controversy, would have found something else to exploit. 

Additionally, there is no - absolutely NO - threat of Argentina attacking the Falklands again. The Argentinan populace doesn't want it, and the government isn't stupid enough to try it. And even if they did, the US has confidence you can handle it on your own, just like you did 25 years ago, without the ego stroke so many in this country seem to feel they are owed by the US. 

And, on the US's 'lecturing tone' on Europe, what is the alternative in this situation? Economies function based on confidence, and it is is in the interests of both England and the US to shore up confidence that two of the world's eminent economic powers will continue to support the Eurozone. Would the Germans have agreed to the bailout of Greece had they thought they didn't have the support of US and England? 

The truth is, the US remains a trusted ally of England, and when push comes to shove, you would probably get the US real and material support on issues THAT MATTER. The US and England's relationship is such that we've overcome the need for circlejerk, and have understanding that when it matters, we have eachother's backs.

There's been a rise in anti-US sentiment in South America.  Governments like Venezuela, Bolivia, and Uruguay (I think) have declared that they are going to be more autonomous on issues like drug control and trade (e.g., with Iran).  Now, Argentina is hardly in that camp, but maybe Washington doesn't want to risk stirring up resentment among South American nations.

On the other hand, it's not like Britain is seriously thinking of turning against America in any way, so there is less to lose if Britain gets a big mad for a brief time. 

However, there is the fact that the UK denied the US permission to use its bases if there's a war with Iran.

So maybe this is ""harmless"" retaliation for your Iran snub - harmless as in it's not going to cost Britain anything except hurt feelings - and an attempt to curry favor in a part of the world where US influence has been declining recently.  I also wouldn't be surprised if it was solely the latter and none of the former; the US might be privately assuring the UK that it supports British claims to the Falklands.",0,1364553834,null,0,false,0,c94kh65,t3_1b6v1s,t1_c94kh65,t1_c94kb13,null,1431741355,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

From visiting friends at other universities, it seems to have less lad culture (although some Medics can get pretty laddish) which is a plus; but it also means there'll be fewer parties. This school year I have gone out only a couple of times, whereas at other unis you tend to go out every other week.

We're also a very self-deprecating university, as you may have picked up from supersonicsongbird. A running joke within Imperial is how shit Imperial is and that it's full of virgins; but it's ok, because at least we aren't the retards over at UCL.

It also has a disproportionately large number of redditors, which means you should get on pretty well with them because you'll share common interests and a similar sense of humour.

In fact I'm pretty sure they have software that searches an image of a drive for dodgy files for them - it was mentioned on reddit before - and I'd have thought that software knows about pagefile.sys.

But you've got a point. If anyone has a reason for having a file full of completely random bytes, they could have a problem proving that's not an encrypted file.

People tend to think strongly encrypted files have recognizable headers. An encrypted zip file obviously does, but that's not a general requirement and an encrypted hard drive volume probably doesn't (I haven't actually checked). And making sure that there's no recognizable patterns that could be used to break encryption, irrespective of patterns in the raw data, means that encrypted data looks like random data (technical term - high entropy).

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;I agree that it's a bit authoritarian for one part of the community to deny access to services another part of the community desires, the degree to which it is depends on the groups' relative sizes, the extent to which the lack of access harms them, and the harms which are likely to arise if free access is given

Nevertheless I think you can understand my point that in a situation where there is no real benefit to anyone having their choices removed, choice minimisation is a negative (as you know, I tend to operate on the principle that maximisation of available choices is the default best option).

&gt;Your initial argument seemed to be that free access to these services wasn't harmful to the group which wished to restrict access, I was endeavouring to show that it likely was

To clarify, is your argument that if the group who *would* shop at Asda do so, it would harm the group that don't want the *Asda*? Also, in what way? I mean, if the group who would shop there stop shopping at local shops and as a result the group who campaigned against it consider themselves ""harmed"" - is that really the fault of the group who decided to shop at Asda? It seems to imply that the local shops have some special *right* to the money of local customers.

The whole thing smells very strongly of protectionism to me.

&gt;Doesn't this almost always happen?

Not in my experience mate. Local ""mini"" supermarkets (the Americans would call them mom &amp; pop stores) go yeah, that's true, but people still go to butchers, fish mongers, to an extent even greengrocers.

Britain had to make promises to many colonies in WW1/WW2 that they could be independent in return for military involvement on the Alliances side. There was no fight left in Europe to go back on these promises, and it set a precedent for the rest of the Empire.

Really, by this point Britain didn't have the money to keep the empire *as it were*, nor the fight left in it to govern the colonies. Britain had lost her fire, and really wanted to pass the torch (so to speak) onto the US as world police.

To answer your question:

* Win against Southampton

* Win against United

* Draw or Win against Rubin

* Draw or Win against Sunderland


I think if we win against Southampton, we should be able to carry our momentum against United. Since we'll be at home for this replay, the advantage will be ours for the taking. The game against Rubin doesn't really matter, as long as we keep a clean sheet. I miss the days when the Bridge was a fortress; maybe we can get back to those days. And I think Sunderland will prove to be a challenging game for a couple reasons: It will be a fourth game in eight days essentially, so our squad will be very tired. Their defense will most certainly try to ""park the bus"", to use a very over-used phrase.

I have high hopes for us against United though. If we play the entire game like we played the second half for the first FA game, we will most certainly win. I'm worried that Nani, who had to leave early in the first game, will be fully healthy and cause all sorts of problems for us. And let's face it: United have everything to lose by losing this game. They've crashed out of the Champions League and the EPL title is basically theirs already, so to at least get a double this season will be at the forefront of SAF's mind.",0,1364559898,null,0,false,0,c94l761,t3_1b8bh8,t1_c94l761,t3_1b8bh8,null,1431741015,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

If your favourite bar is having a ladies night, is it really such a hard thing to go to a different bar that night? And probably men aren't actually banned - a man with the right attitude to it could probably have a really good laugh there anyway.

Also, for over 21 nights - crying, screaming, throwing toys around, throwing up, running around in nappies, singing along to annoying songs really badly, fighting, breast-feeding - these are just some of the things that over 21s like to do, and it's best that they have their own special place and time for it.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;Nevertheless I think you can understand my point that in a situation where there is no real benefit to anyone having their choices removed, choice minimisation is a negative (as you know, I tend to operate on the principle that maximisation of available choices is the default best option).

I agree that reducing choice is generally bad, but I think a) having a high density of the supermarket majors in your local area probably reduces rather than increases substantive choice, and in a related sense, b) I think most modern supermarkets are mostly about an illusion of choice rather than real choice - more than half the products they sell, both edible and non edible, contain corn; shelves are packed with large numbers of products which are  essentially the same but multifariously branded; much of the labelling is highly suspect which erodes choice (and we can't even tell if we're buying beef when we ""choose"" beef), etc.

&gt; is your argument that if the group who would shop at Asda do so, it would harm the group that don't want the Asda?

I think that's certainly a possibility and, on much of the evidence, seems a near certainty (although it might take more than one store to have such an impact, it's about superstore density etc.)

&gt;Also, in what way?

Well, for example, I live in a town with huge numbers of local markets with very cheap fresh produce and a small number of supermarkets where the produce is generally older and fluctuates in price wildly but is non-negotiable.  A higher density of supermarkets will occur at some stage, this is inevitable because the multinationals are pushing hard for it, and it will radically alter the flavour of the town and people's access to cheap, fresh, local produce.  It will allow greater access to imported goods, I don't doubt, and far more processed food.

&gt; It seems to imply that the local shops have some special right to the money of local customers.

Or you could say, the local customers have a right to the services provided by the local shops.

&gt;The whole thing smells very strongly of protectionism to me.

Let's not forget that almost every country which has ever developed in the history of the world has done so through protectionism.  Though you Libertarians disparage it, protectionism has its place.

&gt;people still go to butchers, fish mongers, to an extent even greengrocers.

Hmm, maybe some highly niche boutique River Cottage-y-style stores survive, but they tend to serve a very different clientèle (with far more money) than such run-of-the-mill specialist stores did historically. My family has a history of being driven out of business by multinationals, so maybe I'm biased, but,  they can be truly devastating for local communities and it's difficult to see what they offer them in return - an illusion of choice, cash exported out of the local economy (without taxes being paid) and crappy precarious low quality employment for fewer people than were driven out of business.  Efficiency is often a bullshit piece of economics sleight of hand and it hides a lot of harm.
