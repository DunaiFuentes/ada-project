true,TheGodless1,pertwee,Pertwee,"It's an interesting theory but I think Moffat appreciated the series enough to avoid essentially taking opportunity away from future writers. 

The truth is, the gap between 8 and 9 is an excellent jumping point for a unique story requiring cameos the likes of 'The Five Doctors' which it seems like fans would eat up. The Matt Smith run is rife with references to the classic incarnations and the season finale alone definitely seems to suggest a look backwards rather than forwards. By making John Hurt the next incarnation, you are giving this show an expiration date and nothing the BBC is up to makes me think that's their intention. 

There is one major element to address that a lot of responses here bring up and that is the limited number of regeneration of timelords. The fact is, while this was a major plot point throughout Classic Who, it has never once been addressed in the reboot. Not one time. So I think whether it's that River gave the Doctor enough regenerative energy to give him some extra lives, or Moffat simply wishes you to forget that plot point, I doubt this is going to be of significance.

Finally, and this is probably the main thing, what good does making Hurt the next incarnation do you? No one seems to think that Hurt is going to be Matt Smith's replacement, so simply, the writers have a better story on their hands continuing with what they've given you than trying to work out a big twist. I know one always fears being Moffated but I think in this instance, he has the right idea and I believe the 8-9 gap is where his attention is focused.",0,1372085719,null,0,false,0,cap6e9s,t3_1gxj1q,t1_cap6e9s,t3_1gxj1q,null,1435558272,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,loudribs,eng-yorkshire,2 'E's and some 'LSD',"The Tories are always pretty good value for money when it comes to factionalism and at present there's two main camps, the first being  the dyed in the wool, bring back the birch/rope/National Service right wingers who are basically the Tory party of old. They hate Europe, hate coalition government and most of all, hate Cameron. Most are backbenchers (the Peter Bone's of this world) and they've all got their fingers crossed that their man Liam Fox will make it back into the Cabinet at the next reshuffle.

On the other side you have modernisers who are all too aware that pandering to the right led them to loose three elections on the trot and would like to see the party not getting quite so animated about things like Europe and gay marriage. They've always contended that winning an election is about winning the centre ground and that most ordinary people simply don't care about the things that get the backwoodsmen's knickers in a twist. However, since UKIP has started eating into their vote, they're now in a quandry about how to react. Cameron was always held up as the chief moderniser but he's so pragmatic (pragmatic to the point that no-one really knows what he stands for or what he believes in) that it's very hard to actually pin down exactly what his vision is.

As for the Dib Lems, there's been a long-running split between the Orange Bookers and those of a more social democratic bent. The Orange bookers as exemplfied by David Laws lean heavily towards economic liberalism and a very hands off approach to the state. They have quite a lot in common with left leaning Tories so they've found the experience of coalition to be much better of their brethren. On the other side you have the SD strain and these are much more inclined to see the government intervene in economic policy and actively chivvy redistribution along. These are your Cable's, Hughes' and Williams' and they're really not comfortable in the coalition. 

As for Labour, well it's a bit up in the air. The Blairite/Brownite bloodbath that was widely predicted following their defeat never really came to pass and although there are a few New Labour die-hards, they've not really caused that much mischief. Instead, the whole party seems to be unsure of what it's all about at the moment and doesn't really know what to do. There are many who doubt whether Miliband is the right man for the job (and also if Balls is the right man for the Exchequer) but they are acutely aware that the party has a glorious history of tearing itself apart at the seams and are hedging their bets right now.

It's not damaging or dangerous to remove it.  How's about we yank that out of there for you?  Why?  Well Yaweh told me to, so that's OK right?

If you want to cut into children before the age of consent, the burden of proof is on you to provide testable, quantitative benefits.  

&gt;you should really learn to separate the debates

There isn't a separation.  Circumcision exists because of religion.

&gt;I'm glad that parents continue to have that choice. 

Finally, you make my point for me.  It's the parents' choice you're defending, not the child's.  As the child is the recipient of the unnecessary procedure it's abhorrent that you uphold the parent's rights over the child's.

&gt;would simply keep my nose out of other peoples choices, so far as they don't affect you.

Yes, I'm sure many religious types would like this.  That way you don't need to deal with awkward things like rational thinking, logic, liberalism etc.  I'm not worried about me, no-one's going to circumcise me without my consent.

true,hotcod,null,null,"&gt;You're clearly misunderstanding my point which is not that I think the law should not be applied in these cases but that as a society we can tell that its not a black and white issue. You seem to be perfectly happy that this man is being lumped in with the sort of people who rape babies or snatch children from shopping centres. I see a clear distinction. Yes, he broke clear teacher/pupil boundaries, yes she was underage, these things are illegal and he deserves to be punished.

For some one claiming things are not black and white you are very quick to make a clear distinction between what he did and what they do. To me what he did has the potential to cause the same kind of harm as the people you so clearly don't think he is like. Are their differences? Of course, I've never been debating that just pushing back on the idea that because there are differences he should get a pass from being associated with these things. He took a cause of action the result of which may be the rape of a child. That it might turn out all ok doesn't change the fact he made that choice.    

&gt;d. You seem to think I'm the one making presumptions however I don't feel that the actions of this girl seem to be inspired through fear. 

Who said anything about there having to be fear involved?

&gt; They spent a lot of time together, she agreed to go abroad with him (i think I read somewhere it had been her suggestion) She didn't alert the authorities when the story broke and only when they agreed to turn themselves in did they come back to this country. Even now she stands by him. Naive? Possibly. Fearful? Unlikely. You might he happy to presume he's manipulated her young mind because the law tells us that must be what happened, but I'm not.

Again this is all based on the assumption that she is able to make those choices in a meaningful manner. We don't know if she could, he doesn't know if she could... ultimately there's as much chance that she doesn't know if she could as there is that she does. Which is why it's such a terrible thing that someone to whom her care was entrusted disregarded it. 

Again you are making the presumption that I'm saying she can't have consented. She may very well have given consent as much as she would as an adult. The point is that the law, and the reasons behind those laws, means that that really doesn't matter. The law presumes she couldn't to make sure she is protected if it turns out she can't. Forrester chose to ignore that, to presume that he knew best, and engaged in acts that she may grow to view as rape. That she might not grow to view them as rape does not, again, change the nature of the decision Forrester made.

There is huge amount of talk how we are due to have 2 signings done within 7 days of the Confed finishing (with most signs pointing to Villa and Paulinho) with Baldini, AVB and Levy working on several more.  There is also a fair amount of chatter that when the window opens we are likely to ship off a group of players relatively quickly (sounds like THudd, Parker, BAE one or both of Ade/JD) right at the beginning of the window potentially freeing up even more cash.

They are not wholly selfless as a group, and in fact are quite the opposite: the purpose of professional bodies is to lower for more pay, fewer hours, better working conditions and less accountability, because that is what every human being wants. They don't necessarily want the best for taxpayers, or for the recipients of the service. 

The police have not been reformed for many years, until this government, because subsequent governments have been extremely afraid of challenging them and their power base, even though it is in the interests of us as a nation.

Although it is significant if public sector employees don't agree with the government, it is still important to analyse the proposals ourselves through a cost-benefit prism, and not just presume that because the doctors are against it, it must automatically be wrong.

true,atheistmil,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"Putting aside the cost issue and going by your points:

&gt; Capital Punishment is not, in your opinion or mine, a deterrent.

Agreed. I can't think of any punishment that actually works as a deterrent so I'd suggest the point is moot.

&gt; It would place an authority in the hands of the state which would be open to abuse.

To quibble it would put the power in the hands of the judicary which should not be the same as the hands of the state in theory. But yes, this is the one factor that makes me not a proponent of the death penalty. 

&gt; It would not prevent re-offending of the most heinous kind, this happening most often when violent criminals who had not committed murder escalate their violence.

Er, by definition the death penalty will prevent re-offence since well, they'd be dead and as far as I know ghosts are able to commit crimes. Also, serial killers spring to mind.

&gt; There is no pressing societal need for it to be re-introduced.

True enough, but we have many laws and debates going through Parliament which are a lot way from pressing need yet they still ge debated and may eventually see the statute book. So I don't really see this as an argument against it, maybe one that we should give priority to other things. 

So, of your 4 points I'd say the only one that compels me to think against the death penality is the second one. So to say it is wrong-headed I think is over-doing it. Not compelling sure, I'd buy that and I revert you to my previous points about morality etc.

Also, just for completeness, I'll explore why I think the death penalty should be available for use by the judicary. Before I do so, I'd like to stress that I'd have several major aspects of the criminal justice system altered before I'd agree to this but to save writing a thesis I'll gloss over some pretty major points but if you want more answers feel free to ask.

Judges should be able to put persistent criminals to death if they have not met repeated, court ordered rehabilitation because there should come a point where an individual is perhaps not a terrible risk to society but has demosntrated sufficient indifference to society that one can conclude that the person has no desire or inclination to adhere is at least some commonly acceptable standards.

For example, there are many thieves that have upward of 100 burgalries to their name. Some aggravated others not. But surely given such behaviour we should consider the impact of the potential future victims when weighing up the future threat? 

Leave out the economic aspects entirely. I don't know if you've been a victim of crime but it can be a harrowing experience. It can permanently affect those who have been mugged, attacked and especially raped. Now clearly going round killing everyone for commiting a crime is nonsense because there are a lot of factors involved. But for those serial offenders I dont see why the option should not be there for judges. 

It would stop re-offence, it would also stop prisons getting overly crowded should a 3-strike (or similar) rule be implemented. The US has prisons over-flowing. Not that I think we should kill them all.

You may think that this soundsvery Victorian where kids were hanged for stealing apples. And to some extent I'd agree. However, we are at a point in society where we can provide more help and support for people such that rehabilitation isn't a joke.

It explains why there are only 12 incarnations in the timestream. But he won't be around for long.

He will be the one to fight at Trenzalore. This will probably occur in the 50th. Matt will regenerate into him at the christmas special and soon after (probably during the same episode) John Hurt will regenerate into the new Doctor. He might even force himself to do so.

The reason that it almost has to be the 12th Doctor is because John Hurt said he's part of a trinity of Doctors. You have 10 and 11. So John Hurt is most likely 12 for that to make sense. 

The Doctor obviously knew of him already as is made clear in both the God Complex and The Name of the Doctor. How he came to know of it is unknown, but during Moffat's run dealing with foreknowledge is a constant theme so it wouldn't surprise me.

This is the man who is the top goalscorer of the best nation in world football. We go on and on about how we have no winning mentality, and yet when we're linked with someone who's won nearly everything we seem to want to pass over him in favour of Christian Benteke or Leandro bloody Damiao. 

Yes, he's 31. Yes, he'll cost a bit. But the man is one of the best strikers in Europe and class like his doesn't fade overnight. And if you consider the shirt sales he'll bring in, the people wanting to see him, the fact that he's DAVID FUCKING VILLA and has the class to get 15, 20, 25 if we're lucky goals a season in a system working for him, then it practically pays for itself.

Soldado has played in Eroupa League, Champions League, WC qualifications and most recently in the confederations cup. Performing well as far as I'm concerned. 

He has an insane scoring record despite not playing for either RM or Barcelona and his return has only risen. 

He is much more physical than Villa to begin with and he fits the lone striker role alot better especially in the BPL. 

All in all in my opinion he is a much safer and better transfer than David Villa. If we can get both of em sure(which we can't), go for it. 

But if I had to choose, I'd take Soldado every day of the week.

true,lionmoose,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,"I think some sort of severity of harm should be the primary criterion, yes. Most forms of FGC seem to me to be primarily harmful- I can't see any sort of benefit. 

I think MGC may be slightly more complicated, but this is largely outside my area of expertise so I'm not sure this will be coherent. Most forms of severe MGC (someone else mentioned *castrati* for instance) seem to have fortunately died out. Circumcision as we currently know it *prima facie* would seem to be a candidate for restrictive legislation. However, there were a number of users in the thread who broadly seemed happy in being circumcised.  If it **has** to happen, there is an argument that it should happen before people get too old- I think there is a greater risk of complication for older patients? I'm sure how credible it is, but I think there is some evidence from certain settings (I'm familiar more with Africa) of a protective effect even from things like STD transmission (even AIDS I think- albeit I think it relied on cross-sectional data).

You can call my posts emotionally charged if you like but so far not a single person has managed in my view to provide *anything* approaching a coherent and logical argument for why this is ok. It's based on conjecture and seeking to trip the law up over not being what it was never intended to be. Largely based around the idea that a 15 year might have been able to consent so we should simply ignore the fact that she might not have been that largely results in these people who think they are standing up for the girl not allowing her to make choices because ""it wasn't really rape rape"".

There is a reason that London is a conduit to Europe, and that is because places like Hull are not given the infrastructure to handle the traffic. We have some of the best docks in england, but the roads can simply not handle the traffic the docks can support.

Also you could argue that the whole way the NHS was set up with disconnected primary care trusts that can borrow debt and even go bankrupt is really anti-nationalist.

Yeah, I was referring to the term ""rational thought"" rather than the individual words but never mind.

They're voiceless because they're not people.  But by now I'm sure you have an inkling to my arguments here, and I'm pretty sure I know yours.

Well, rational certainly doesn't apply to faith.  I don't have a ""fear"" (you do love your dramatic language, must be all the bible study), it's a simple moral notion.  It is wrong to perform unnecessary medical procedures on people who don't have a choice.  No fear, no belief required to make that assertion.

&gt;definition of disagreement. 

I absolutely understand it.  The result of whether I understand it or not makes no difference as to whether you're right or wrong however.  You not understanding rationality though, makes a huge difference in an argument about rationality vs religion.

&gt;don't be too vague, will you?

Luckily the circumstances of a situation contribute towards my moral outlook, unlike the moral absolutes laid out by deities to Middle Eastern peasants.

Ramires will be in his natural Box to box position and Mata and Hazard will be working together at all times. Ramires could be switched out for Oscar and KDB for Schurrle on the wing.

He has won a lot, I agree, but so had the players who got relegated with QPR this season. Villa has been a world class striker for a long time now, but those achievements were made when he was in his prime (and he has since then suffered a broken leg) and with (possibly) the greatest team of all time.

&gt;This is the man who is the top goalscorer of the best nation in world football

A team with Iniesta, Xavi and Busquets in the middle is going to churn out chance after chance. I don't disagree that the top scoring record is some achievement, but let's not forget that he played in a golden generation and was a cog in the system, rather than a solo bright light. Torres has also performed for Spain, but look how he is in the EPL (in a team with more talent than spurs).

&gt;has the class to get 15, 20, 25 if we're lucky goals a season in a system working for him, then it practically pays for itself.

He has played with the likes of Silva, Iniesta, Xavi and Fabregas behind him for his whole career. Creativity wise spurs don't have one player that could tie the boots of those guys. I wouldn't expect his goal stats in La Liga to translate over into the PL anything like 20-25 goals.

Suarez is a proven player. A true warrior. He fights and fights and fights. Part of the reason we relied on him too much was he was our only goalscorer for all of 2 and a half seasons. He got used to his role and really perfected it. 

That doesn't mean that he won't be able to adjust to being surrounded by talented players who can ease some of the burden. I've always found Suarez too do whats in the best of the team.

As to the second, ff the pregnant lady is stressed because she'll be unable to offer the child a life she feels she should give it, or if she's stressed because she's too young, or if she's stressed because she's been raped, and a plethora of other awful circumstances you can imagine, then yes, morally I'm OK with the difficult decision to abort the pregnancy.

He is now the top all time goal scorer for his county at the tender age of 26. He netted 30 goals in all competitions last season and arguably would of/could of won the golden boot.   
  
Aspas is a good player and a good signing but he is far from that 1% bracket in which we find Suarez. He seems to work hard and chip in with defending and winning the ball back as well as going forward but does he have the footballing genius, even magic, that Suarez has. The answer is unequivocally no.  
  
Again I'm happy we are signing Apas but losing Suarez will be a huge loss and he will be near imposable (but not totally imposable) to replace. While Aspas could replace him on the team sheet he won't replace his ability on the pitch.  
  
Personally I feel Suarez will stay at Liverpool next year. 1) Because it seems that his comments were often editorialized. 2) Because it seems illogical for Madrid ro go in for him when they are looking of off-load a striker, and the possibility that Suarez could be way down on their priority list with Bale, Cavani and Isco ahead of him. And would they want to spend big for Suarez if they get even one of the above mentioned targets?

true,OJSlaughter,eng-buckinhamshire,Aylesbury Vale,"See, I personally think the fact that babies can't consent it the primary problem. It is actually impossible to know if a circumcision is necessary until children start to get older, most boys who are medically circumcised will have it at age 6 or 7 with no negative effects. I personally had it at 11, which is the latest it should happen (as it is important to have it before puberty when it comes to medical circumcision). **I will add that most medical circumcisions done in the UK are in fact unnecessary anyway, hence why so many, many more are done in the UK when compared to other countries.** 

Regret is not the key issue here. You don't regret a decision you didn't make, you live with it: I personally think regret is entirely to wrong word for it. I don't understand how we can justify the suffering that some have due to be forcibly circumcised because many people don't have an issue with it. That is like saying that we should aim to improve the lives of women in the Middle Easy because most women there are fine with it (which they are by the way) or that we shouldn't worry about crimes if they are not reported because obviously the victims didn't feel it was bad enough to report anyway. Why not avoid it entirely by not having the unnecessary operaton? 

Following all that, the men who are circumcised have been like that their entirely lives in most cases. They have been through their whole life development and they will have always identified themselves as being circumcised, so it is no surprise that they have no issue with it. 

No there is no evidence that it helps prevent STDs. Certainly there is evidence that those in Africa who are circumcised have less STDs but then they also tend to be part of certain groups who are less likely to have STDs to begin with. 

There is no good argument for allowing male circumcision to continue in the UK, at least not unnecessarily on infants who can't say a word in protest.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;He has won a lot, I agree, but so had the players who got relegated with QPR this season. Villa has been a world class striker for a long time now, but those achievements were made when he was in his prime (and he has since then suffered a broken leg) and with (possibly) the greatest team of all time.

Yeah but he's a bit better than Jose Boswinga. And in his prime? He won the Champion's League two years ago. He would have been in the Spanish Euro's squad had he not broken his leg (which hasn't really shown signs of affecting him, he scored in his first game back and got 16 in 39 games mostly as a substitute [by the way I should amend my original post]). 

&gt;A team with Iniesta, Xavi and Busquets in the middle is going to churn out chance after chance. I don't disagree that the top scoring record is some achievement, but let's not forget that he played in a golden generation and was a cog in the system, rather than a solo bright light. Torres has also performed for Spain, but look how he is in the EPL (in a team with more talent than spurs).

Just because you've got arguably the best central midfield ever assisting you doesn't mean you're guaranteed goals - see Defoe/Ade this year with Lennon/Bale. And he didn't exactly completely rely on them, look at the Spain game against Tahiti just a few days ago, yes they're poor opposition but he set up a lovely goal for Silva and then finished the chances himself. What we need first and foremost is a finisher, he is one.

And Torres was arguably the best striker in Europe for Liverpool at around 2008, if he turns out like him for us I'll be delighted.

&gt;He has played with the likes of Silva, Iniesta, Xavi and Fabregas behind him for his whole career. Creativity wise spurs don't have one player that could tie the boots of those guys. I wouldn't expect his goal stats in La Liga to translate over into the PL anything like 20-25 goals.

It's not like a team with Bale, Lennon, Dembele, possibly Paulinho, Sigurdsson, possibly Bernard or Lamela and Holtby is short of creativity. You've got to remember that in the past few years the team's not been focused around him, he's not been playing his favoured position through the centre, he's been playing off Messi. A team where he's the main striker has infinite possibilities. 

&gt;VDV was 4 years younger than Villa when spurs signed him.

Could barely finish games though and still was vital.

I get that people'd be hesitant about price since it's unlikely we'd recoup it. However, the man is such a talent and has such a reputation he's worth it. I want to see some of the best and biggest players in the world at Tottenham, and he's one of them.

It boggles your mind that people who are Social Conservatives aren't ideological purists?  That their views are made up of more than one just one line of thought?  A lot of social conservatives would quite simply argue that civil partnerships do the same thing as marriage without confusing the two, and that's fine by them.

&gt; why would the church oppose it, it's an additional source of revenue

Clearly, you've misunderstood one of the principles of following a specific religious ethical code: namely that if you believe something to be right, you don't do the opposite for ease or comfort.  This is the same reason the church doesn't work as a front for organised crime: it might pay well, but it goes against what they believe.

&gt; if God thinks gays are going to hell, priests lying to them can only help

I...what?  That doesn't even make sense.

&gt; Gay marriage is entirely conservative

No, not nearly entirely.  Most people arguing for gay marriage are doing so from a liberal point of view, arguing that equality of partnership in law should be extended to gay people.  The argument is largely based on ideas of equality, not ideas of providing stable relationships (which a lot of people argue civil partnerships would do roughly as much).

&gt; no rational conservative should oppose it

Perhaps, but this entirely assumes reason should be the only factor in the debate, whereas the main reason people reject it is because they are using a faith-based system of decision making.  Faith and reason have different pros and cons, but it's foolish to assume social conservatives only back one thing because it's the 'rational' thing to do.",0,1372106527,null,0,false,0,cape5ky,t3_1gxn8a,t1_cape5ky,t1_cap3j0o,null,1430697874,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

All the contradicting studies, and reviews of those studies point to there being no clear, quantifiable health benefit to circumcision.  But we've been here.  Either you do not know how the scientific method works, or you're cherry picking data to support your argument; where no clear scientific consensus exists, you apparently are magically able to make a consensus appear.  

&gt; becoming elitist and bigoted

If someone hears voices in their head, or makes up imaginary friends to talk to, we call them crazy.  To you it's different if it's God or Jesus or Allah talking to you, I make no such distinction.  It's not bigoted or elitist, it's the end result of a logical thought process.  Adults that talk to their made up daddy in the sky are not normal.

&gt;If you ever want to continue the debate

What debate?  We've been round in a circle about circumcision and now we're doing laps of abortion (why you want to know my views on abortion I don't know).  I think you might be considering the idea that I'm trying to ""convert"" you, to sway you from your beliefs.  I'm not, I'm just saying that in this day and age, in a secular society, people will call you to account on your crazy bullshit - especially when it affects the weakest members of our society.

Of course, they're not even close to 100% accurate, but I believe that they at least try to be truthful and won't publish outright falsehoods just to fit an agenda or to do so on behalf of any particular political party. 

An interesting example is something like the BBC's attitude towards man-made climate change. It's been described as highly biased and partisan in its acceptance of it, but a decision was made that the supposed controversy is so unbalanced that reporting as if there actually is controversy in the credible scientific community would be unreasonable.

It's also been criticised by Tories for calling cuts 'cuts' when they want the BBC to call the cuts 'savings'. This in itself shows that it's not the state propaganda organ than some Americans seem to believe it is.

A fair attempt, but I would particularly call it a cosplay considering you're actually just wearing a suit.

I don't mean to be an asshole about this, but it's really the only way to say it, this whole thing comes across as 'I didn't really bother'. 

The suit you wear is black, not brown and with a white, not blue pinstripe.

The shirt you wear is... I can't even tell in the pictures but with the brown suit Tennant wore either light blue, dark blue or on one occasion a mustard coloured shirt. 

The tie is wrong. Red ties with blue elements for the blue shirt. Brown ties with blue elements for the brown suit. 

The converse are wrong. Maroon chucks with the Blue suit, Off white (or as they're called now 'Cream') or black chucks with the brown suit.

The glasses are yours, but do look fairly similar.

But the bit that really bugs me, is that you seem to have put so much effort into styling your hair just right, and a damn good job on it too, but you can't even gets the right goddamn screwdriver? I've seen multiple websites selling the character options 10 screwdriver that ship to the US.

Sorry, but this whole thing to me just comes across as a lazy karma grab. Contrary to many people here I don't think you look THAT much like Tennant, certainly not enough to not bother at all with the costume and call it a cosplay.

I don't think Bale should be starting on the right so much rather than periodically switching with Lennon to try new tactics against teams mid games.

He does.

I am not.  It only makes sense to me if we are committed to starting Bale in the middle which I don't see happening ESPECIALLY if we sign Paulinho.

Righty ho', well that mosque needs to be closed immediately then.

&gt; The Fulmer mosque’s Sheikh Habib, 34, was imprisoned in his native Kuwait in 2003 for espousing views which attacked in lewd terms some of the most revered figures of Sunni Islam. He came to Britain in 2004 after having his Kuwati citizenship revoked, and has built a sizable following across the Middle East through his television station Fadak TV.

&gt; Sheikh Habib, who insists that musical instruments are un-Islamic, has also preached that infants are sorted at birth by a “devil” who sexually assaults non-Shia children.

He can fuck off back to Kuwait, he shouldn't be our problem.


&gt; During scuffles, a man suffered serious cuts to his face and required hospital treatment after he was surrounded by some protesters. He later made a formal complaint to Scotland Yard saying his attackers had called him “Shia”.

Well, whoever committed this should be tried for a hate crime and deported.

&gt; David Cameron hinted last week that mosques seeking to ban extremist preachers could have their legal fees paid from public funds as part of a raft of measures being drawn up by a ministerial task force

Wait, what? Perhaps we just throw their case out before it even reaches court.


&gt; Pauline Vahey, the chairwoman of the parish council, said: “We are a small but diverse community. We are optimistic about the new mosque...It is all about how they conduct themselves and integrate with the community.”

Right, good thing they're working towards providing a multi-cultural, integrated society then.

Youngsters these days are victims of the NHS - they pay tax to provide two or three additional years of life to their extraordinarily old grandparents -- many of whom are living alone in sizable family homes while youngsters in their 20s/30s with children are raising them in small inadequate rented flats because they can't afford/access any better. They pay all this money when in all likelyhood they will not recieve the same service for free when they need it.

A lot of routine NHS work like knee replacements could be shifted into a cost contribution model - people wouldn't like paying so it would have to be coupled with better service like faster waiting times.

As for clothing, if you're looking for accuracy but a bit of DIY, you can get a 95% accurate Tennant suit fabric from Magnoli Clothiers then tailor it up yourself, I personally sent mine to Baron Boutique to get made and it came out beautifully (Or Baron do their own fabric which is around 90% accurate). 

As for the coat, there is no real 100% accurate one out there, closest is Steve Ricks tailor made coats, but for one of those you're looking at £700-£900. Most accurate of the cheaper coats would probably be CosplaySky (The 'official' Abbyshot one is absolute pants).

Sonic Screwdrivers? There's the Character Options toy (If you can get a hold of the one that was packaged with the journal of impossible things or wrist device, that's the most accurate dimensionally), if you want to cash out, again. £300odd from the celestial toystore, but it as a completely accurate 100% prop replica, well worth the cost.

The harsh reality of Tennant cosplay is that, aside from the shirts. If you want accuracy you're either going to have to learn a hell of a lot about tailoring or purchase from somebody else. There is no such thing as a 'found item' Tennant cosplay. His coat was completely custom, as was the suit (The brown suit was made from trousers from GAP's 2004 line and are long sold out, the blue was made from a fabric which again, long sold out and re-dyed before making into a suit). 

It's why a lot of people tend to go for Smith, his look is comparatively unique and the merchandise is a lot easier to get a hold of, a right colour tweed jacket, bowtie and suspenders will give off a lot stronger Doctor vibe than a man in a suit, which is why those that go for Tennant have to try a lot harder in terms of accuracy to get the right 'feel'. 

I've found that cosplay is quite widely accepted on Reddit (especially on r/DoctorWho), I guess it's the nature of Reddit that annoys me, somebody that puts time and money into getting everything right can get no attention, and somebody like you who has thrown everything together at the last minute gets tons.

He willingness to keep his width was better than any player on the team deployed in wide and advanced areas this past season and that's another crucial factor in playing the 4-3-3 system, or really any system in which pacy wide players are needed(all of them really).

A long time ago, on a cold and  misty autumn morning, a farmer from Mobberley was crossing the Edge in order to sell his beautiful milk-white mare at Macclesfield market. Upon reaching the Thieves' Hole the horse stopped and refused to move forward for, out of nowhere it seemed, appeared an old man dressed in a dark flowing gown and  with long hair and beard. The old man offered to buy the horse but the farmer rudely refused believing he would receive a better price at the market. ""Go then"" said the old man ""but mark my words, although your horse will be much admired, no buyer will come forth and I will await your return and buy the animal"".

To the farmer's surprise and disappointment the horse was admired by all at the market but nobody was willing to buy. Leaving the market behind him the farmer once again crossed over the Edge in low spirits and cursing his luck. When the farmer reached the Thieves' Hole he was amazed to see the old man waiting for him although he was an old man no more but a tall, proud wizard holding a staff in his hand. The wizard bade the farmer to follow and led both farmer and beast past Seven Firs, the Golden Stone, Stormy Point and Saddlebole until he reached a large rock embedded in the hillside.
 	 	 	 
The wizard touched the rock with his staff and with a sound like thunder the rock split in two and revealed a pair of Iron Gates. With this the horse reared and the farmer fell to his knees begging for mercy. The wizard told the farmer not to be afraid and led both man and beast along a cave and into a large cavern full of sleeping knights. Beside all but one knight was a milk-white mare which was also in enchanted sleep. The wizard led the farmer into another cavern full of jewels and bade him to take his share as payment for the horse as it was needed for the last knight. He then went on to explain that one day during the reign of George the son of George both man and horse will awake and fight a decisive battle on the plain below which will save the country. With that the wizard told the astonished farmer to leave who lost no time in obeying and heard the Iron Gates close behind him with the same thunderous noise.

The farmer returned on many occasions to search for the Iron Gates but his efforts were in vain. From that day to this people have scoured the Edge trying to locate the Gates. Ellen Beck swore she once found them but was said to be mad and the tale of her life is a sad one. It is generally believed that the gates  lie somewhere near the Holy Well and Stormy Point. Alan Garner used a tooth-shaped rock as the location of the Iron Gates for his fictional books on the Edge, which can be found on the path between Stormy Point and Saddlebole.

It also had a playground, so a lot of parents took their kids so they could play on it. There was a bit of a reputation surrounding room 13 of this hotel - that the room was locked permanently, was decrepit on the inside, and played host to all manner of spectres. To further this rumour, the curtains of room 13's window, which were visible from the play area if you climbed to the top of the climbing frame, were always shut and there was no way to see into the room.

I used to go there a lot with my friends when I was younger because the playground was badass, and one time we asked the bloke behind the bar (whom we liked because used to give us free crisps) if it was true, if the hotel was really haunted. He pulled out a folder of photographs from behind the bar that contained the results of a supposed paranormal investigation; the photographs were supposed to depict the ghost. 

Instead, what was on the pictures were just pictures of people at the hotel in the lounges or whatever, but it looked like someone had put a drop of water on the picture and let the ink run until the water dried up, making an orb-like appearance on the picture. Some of the pictures depicted mild rashes on the arms of hotel guests, supposedly the work of the poltergeist scratching them as they slept.

Despite the obviously dubious paranormal evidence, nine-year-old me was fascinated and perpetuated the myth to all of my friends, and played games in the hotel grounds where we would pretend to be ghost-hunters and chase down the phantom.

true,sickgrof,num10-away,,"1) Lennon is definitely top 4 quality. He provides great width on the wing and he showed many times this year that he has the definite ability to track back and help out on defense. Additionally, he's obviously one of the fastest players in the league and that alone can set up great things. The only problem is that I think he doesn't fit so well in AVB's 4-3-3, which (ideally) requires a left-footed RW that can cut in to shoot, which brings me to...

2) If we switch to AVB's 4-3-3, then Bale's ideal position is inverted RW, because he can cut in and shoot with his left, while still having plenty of space to be creative. Lennon is definitely top 4 quality, but the problem is he plays in the same ideal position as arguably the best player in the league.

3) As I've stated a couple times, in the ideal starting XI, Azza doesn't quite fit, but I think he can definitely fit into AVB's system as a super sub. Could you imagine Azza coming into the match at the 70' mark, fully fresh with the defense out there trying to catch their breath? That could be deadly. If Azza can somehow be encouraged to have more of an eye for goal, I see no reason he couldn't jump in as an inverted LW late in the match to make things happen.

4) I watched most of QPR's matches when Townsend was there, specifically to watch Townsend, and for that reason, I'm not at all hellbent on signing a winger. Honestly, Bernard would be the only one I would even want, purely for the potential, but even if we passed on him, I wouldn't mind in the slightest. I think Townsend has clearly shown that he deserves a chance. I remember reading a stat in March where he was the 5th highest rated player in EUROPE by whoscored.com. He was on like an 8.7 or something insane like that. It might've only been for the month or something, but it definitely wasn't only for one match.

5) Overall, I would have to rate Azza in sections. On a good day, he's a 9, on an off day he's a 6 (because he always has the ability to make something happen out of nothing). That puts him overall at a 7.5. If he somehow starts to have more of an eye for goal, I think he can jump to a whole other level.",0,1372119361,null,0,false,0,capiqdd,t3_1gzx0p,t1_capiqdd,t3_1gzx0p,null,1430695716,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

The problem with Kobe (and I'm saying this as a huge Lakers fan) is that he will win you games with sheer brilliance but will also lose you games when he's not making the near-impossible shots he takes. The Lakers have actually been in the bottom half of the league in efficiency at the end of games the past few years because if Kobe isn't carrying the team, the team doesn't score.

This past year it felt similar with Suarez where if he had a bad game, he would have lots of turnovers trying to dribble through the whole defense and the offense sputtered as a result. Personally, I'd rather see a team less dependent on one person taking the defense on by himself, and if Suarez can fit into that team, I'm all for it.

true,MrJMaxted0291,uk,United Kingdom,"I think that when comparing the various issues facing us and other developed countries, the UK is possibly the best of the bunch. The United Kingdom is arguably the best country to be born into in the whole world.

As has already been stated, we benefit from the world class service of the BBC, a greatly neutral and professional media enterprise that provides a mostly dispassionate, unbiased news service and entertainment in radio and television format all over the world.

British people benefit from the Lingua Franca as do our cousins in the commonwealth and the US, with the rest of the world scrambling to learn English as they seek to integrate with us in an increasingly globalized world.

We benefit from a brilliant social healthcare system and have robust social safety nets in place to protect us from poverty and homelessness; If an elderly relative gets sick, then you can rest assured they won't lose their life's savings when they seek treatment at an NHS hospital. Likewise, if you cannot scrounge together the money to keep yourself afloat, you can apply for any benefits that you may be entitled to, including housing benefits and benefits for the unemployed.

We can send our children to university safe in the knowledge that they won't be crippled by the debt this would normally entail in countries such as the US; while debt is still accumulated (£9000 tuition per annum + living expense in the form of student loans and grants) this loan is granted with special terms greatly in favour of students, meaning they don't have to pay a penny until their degree actually earns them money (£21000+ per annum), and even then they're only expected to pay out 9% of their total income per year. If you never earn above £21000, you don't have to pay for a thing.

Our citizens enjoy many rights that are suppressed by our peers in the developed world. If you happen to wear a burqa as part of your religious beliefs, you can rest assured the state won't tear it away from you and demand you dress like everyone else as is the case in France.

British passports enjoy versatility that is hard to find anywhere else, giving free access across Europe, the Americas and Asia. Visas are often completely free for us in some areas where as people from other countries will have to pay.

We boast a rich and ancient culture that dates back to Roman times. The geopolitical influence of our colourful history still has a bearing on world politics today, with the UK benefiting from unique relationships with all countries that inhabit the Anglosphere and many other countries outside our family of nations still have deep rooted historical ties with us which date back as far as the 16th century. 

To top it all off, we just so happen to be one of the richest, most developed countries in the world sitting in a geological location that is virtually devoid of extreme natural phenomena like earthquakes, tornadoes or floods. The most we can complain about are long, mild winters and unpredictable summers. We can't even complain about dangerous local fauna keeping us from enjoying the great British outdoors since wolves were eradicated centuries ago. Fed up of being surrounded by lush deciduous countryside and picturesque chalk beaches? Why not hop on a ferry over to a whole continent every bit as nuanced and cultured as we are!?

Pretty much, as much as we have a penchant to complain about petty shit, the UK is actually the balls and a very strong contender for best country in the world, at least in terms of the benefits of being a national.",0,1372120167,null,0,1372124116,0,capizxl,t3_1gzh1f,t1_capizxl,t1_capbtme,null,1430695591,115,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,115

&gt; A team with Iniesta, Xavi and Busquets in the middle is going to churn out chance after chance. 

The important thing is that he's converting a respectable number of those chances. That's exactly what we struggled with. iirc, we were on the upper end of the table for chance creation but near the bottom for chance conversion. Villa's signing would be intended to remedy that. We don't need a pacy center forward; teams are beginning to sit way too deep against us for that to be a huge help. We need a striker that can take up good positions in the box, can assist in buildup play and has excellent close control with an eye for goal. Ade and Defoe each have a couple of those attributes, but not all, while Villa does have all of those attributes. I'm on the fence based almost entirely on the fee, similarly to how I felt about Dempsey last year.

true,flashpb04,BR,brazil,"When you play with 2 midfielders sitting behind an attacking mid and 2 high wingers, it is most times necessary to find a balance of forward, creative thinking/ outlet play and a separate role mostly defined for cover for the back 4. The easiest method to do this is to play 2 defensive minded players, but with slightly different responsibilities. Lets take how Brazil have used Paulinho and Luis Gustavo in the Confed. this year... Luis Gustavo's main responsibilities are to be the last line of defense before the back 4 gets involved in defending the opponents offensive third; he is there to clear things up and push the ball back out, preferably to his more ""attacking minded"", defensive midfielder...ie, the pivot role. The pivot player is responsible for taking the ball from the back, and finding the most space and outlet for attack. When the two players in the defensive midfield roles have a dynamic understanding of each of their roles, then it works beautifully.

Paulinho has the priveledge of moving up with the attack and making key, late runs into the box when necessary and applicable... he is Brazil's pivot player.

In a 4-3-3 Hazard starts on the LW and has no defensive responsibilities with total freedom to roam the attacking third and not run in to two other players, but only interchange with one. Same foes for Mata on the RW.

In a 4-3-3 Oscar could play a similar role as an inverted winger, or he could drop into the midfield 3 as an advanced midfielder, again with tons of freedom and less defensive responsibility than in a 4-2-3-1.

Same goes for De Bruyne.

true,showmethefever,flair8,,"Lennon's pace alone is enough to keep him as a useful player, but I think he's gotten much better over the years. Back in 2010/11, he was simply just fast and a bit of a liability in other aspects. Now, his decision making and passing seem to be much better. Plus, Lennon and Walker work so well together on that right side that many teams can't handle them. 

The best part about Lennon is that he has that one move, pretty much his only move, where he cuts in towards the top of the 18 and then takes a big touch down the side and gets around the defender. I know he's going to do it every time, the defender knows he's going to do it, but it still seems to work every time haha. 

So, yes, I see him as top 4 quality. I like him on the right (at least for most of the game), because he's pretty ineffective elsewhere on the pitch and the duo of him and Walker works well. Lennon fits into both a 4-2-3-1 and a 4-3-3 and I think he fit in perfectly fine this year. 

I don't think we need to spend money on another winger. Bale and Lennon work great. Dempsey and Sigurdsson can provide cover, although neither seem to prefer being out wide. If we sign David Villa, then he can play out wide and in the middle, in a situation where he and Bale can flow in and out of either spot.

I'd say Lennon is like a 7 or 7.5 out of 10.",0,1372127449,null,0,false,0,capljmu,t3_1gzx0p,t1_capljmu,t3_1gzx0p,null,1430694317,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

We have had a defensive mentality for so long, I think we are all sort of tied to it. There is no reason not to play with four really attacking minded players.

To repeat myself for the fifth or sixth time; that is no reason to engage in a medical procedure. 

&gt;adults that have an obsession with the beliefs of others

Nobody would give a shit about the beliefs you have in your own crazy little world if they had no bearing on the real world.  Unfortunately the world as whole suffers immensely under the weight of religious bullshit of all flavours.  Believe what you want, just don't expect secular progressive societies to listen to these ravings any more.

&gt;Is it ok at 18 weeks and not at 19? etc.

No idea where the obsession with exact numbers comes from here.  When the embryo becomes sentient, basic human rights should be considered.  As to the exact date that happens, neither you or I are qualified to answer it - it's a matter for practising doctors to decide - i.e lets use the best information available to us at the time, rather than take our ideas from an insane book cobbled together a few thousand years ago.

&gt;stressed mother.

This ""stressed mother"" is entirely your fabrication.  You're writing both sides of the argument and disagreeing with yourself again.  That logic thing is a bitch...

&gt;murder of a baby

Abortion isn't murder (but there you go with that dramatic language again, all hellfire and brimstone aren't you).  So to clarify, abortion is not morally outrageous, denying a living member of society a choice about their own body is.  It's not that I need to agree to both or neither, that's a false dichotomy you've set up with your batshit moral absolutes again.

In addition, should we get a world class striker such as Cavani, it frees those outsiders to play balls into the middle and make diagonal and cutting runs.

Don't get me wrong, I think Lennon is a good player, but he isn't great, and he isn't top 4 quality. The starters on all of the top 4 teams are all a level or two above Lennon. Lennon is just to one dimensional to me. He is very good at running at fullbacks and beating them to the end line to get in a cross, but we don't have the players to consistently attack these crosses. Also, when we play smaller teams, they usually park the bus and sit very deep, virtually taking away to run at defenders often. Every now and then he'll chip in a goal or play a good through ball but we need more goals from our wingers if we're gonna play a 4-3-3.

Because of this, Bale needs to play on the right in my opinion. Siggy would be a good option on the left and a new striker in the middle would make our front three extremely dangerous. I just don't see us having enough goal scorers on the field with Lennon playing in the front three. I don't think he should be sold though. He would be a fantastic sub and would add great depth to the squad to play when other players need rest. I don't think we need to buy a new winger either. Townsend, Siggy, and Dempsey can play LW and Bale, Lennon and Townsend can play RW, with Holtby filling in in emergency situations. I wouldn't even be opposed to giving Pritchard some games on the bench and seeing what he can do if we need a LW. 

If we were to buy a winger though, I don't want an overpriced Ince. There are some steals from teams in Europe that would sell proven players for the 10 mil you would have to pay for Ince. Players like Patrick Ebert, Inbrahim Affelay, and Valentin Stocker all come to mind. But I would much rather the money that would go into a winger for a proven striker.

If he could somehow add an eye for goal to game, that would completely change him as a player and make him so much better. But as of now, I would rate him a 6. He has always had so much potential and I think he should be a much better player than he is at the age he is now, but its not to late to improve and I think he seems to be on the brink of becoming top 4 quality. He showed flashes of it last season but I need more to be sold on him.",0,1372137230,null,0,false,0,capovp6,t3_1gzx0p,t1_capovp6,t3_1gzx0p,null,1430692746,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

I am not sure exactly how much we should read into his time at qpr- the rest of the team were fucking pathetic at times, townsend was playing for his career (improve, impress etc.) The others didn't look like they cared much at all.

Falque, well, I want to believe. But he's 24 in January and if he was going to be good enough we'd have seen it by now. My guess would be that AVB will want to see him in preseason, but odds are he'll be sold. He's behind Townsend in the pecking order imo, and another loan at 24 seems a little pointless.

They're often done in dangerous, insanity conditions, and lead to long term problems with menstruation, UTIs, and even basic urination. This doesn't happen with circumcision.  

I'd compare this to the dialogue about domestic abuse. ""half of domestic abuse victims are men!"" say men's rights groups. While that's true, the majority of serious cases are against women. When it says ""half of victims"", that counts a person who's been slapped once by a partner the same as someone who's been beaten and thrown down the stairs.  
The difference in this case is that men can also be victims of serious domestic abuse (its just less likely) and not serious genital mutilation.  
So yes, if a man is a victim of serious domestic abuse, obviously they deserve the same treatment as a women in the same situation (which they often don't get unfortunately). Same with genital mutilation, except that it never (or as close as never) affects males.

Saying ""this affects men as well"" trivialises the issue to me. Men aren't at risk of death, serious long term issues (obviously this happens in a tiny minority of cases, but its not the same by a street), or having this done to subjugate them to women. 

As a reply to your other point of ""they take their daughters, so they must be ok with it"", I'm not sure that really is proof. They do it because its expected, or because they can't be married if this hasn't been done. Not because they ""want"" to do it.

&gt; Simon Mignolet is due on Merseyside today to put the finishing touches on his £10m transfer to Liverpool FC.

&gt;The Sunderland goalkeeper is scheduled to undergo a medical at the Reds’ Melwood training ground on Tuesday afternoon, and is expected to agree a five-year contract.

&gt;The deal for Mignolet involves an initial payment of £9m to Sunderland, with another £1m due in performance-related add-ons, based on appearances and achievements. It will make the Belgian the most expensive goalkeeper in the history of the club.

He explains negotiation with Mkhitaryan and Ilori's people continue:
&gt; Rodgers, meanwhile, remains keen to add further to his squad this summer, though negotiations to sign Shakhtar Donetsk midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Sporting Lisbon defender Tiago Ilori have yet to reach a suitable conclusion.

He says Christian Atsu is a target:

&gt;FC Porto winger Christian Atsu, who is valued at around £4m, is another target. 

And possibly my favourite part of the piece, he rubbishes talk of a Hendo exit:

&gt;And although it is understood that reports linking the Reds with a move for Celtic’s powerful midfielder Victor Wanyama are premature, the player is rated by the club.

true,MrJMaxted0291,uk,United Kingdom,"With regards to university expenses, are you suggesting that the terms of the student loans and grants system will be changed so that students will be required to pay all that tuition money up front? As I described in my original post, as the system currently stands student debt doesn't even necessarily need to be paid assuming you never earn over £21000 p/a. Yes, the actual cost of tuition has risen substantially and may even continue to rise in the future in spite of pledges that it will remain capped at £9000. However, if you are unable to pay the debt off within 20 years by paying forward 9% of your annual earnings over £21000 the debt is written off by the state so assuming they don't overhaul the entire student loans system before the next general election my point still stands.

The point you are peddling about bears, boars and wolves being reintroduced into the UK is still an issue being debated and ironed out, with vocal criticism coming from naturalists such as Ray Mears. It's also worth noting that the plan for the reintroduction of wolves to the UK is to be limited to conservation grounds in the Scottish highlands as a controlled experiment to gauge how the environment responds to reintroducing an animal that's been estimated to have been extinct in the area since the middle ages. It would be environmentally irresponsible to just loose wolves on the British countryside.

As for UKIP, they have exactly 0 seats in the house of commons, and they're political influence is limited predominantly to the European parliament. They have virtually no actual local political power beyond the laughable 219 council seats they hold in local government councils across the whole UK. Out of over 21000. They hold exactly 1 hundredth of the pitifully un-influential seats to county councils. They are a rebellion party in the strictest sense of the word and hold no actual power beyond being the group that gave Torie backbencher homophobes the excuse they needed to rebel against David Cameron for supporting gay marriage.

I cannot deny the NHS has been facing some serious butchery for some time since before the coalition government took charge, and it's only gotten worse since. With regards to the future of the organisation, it is completely out of the hands of ordinary people like you and me and sadly completely at the mercy of the Torie vultures looking to pick it clean for their corporate buddies.

Sweet.  My God tells me that we should cut the earlobes off babies.  Might as well take a kidney too - you don't need two of them, so no harm done.  Lets have the nipples off male children too, unnecessary bits of skin.  I'm sure you'd agree this is a ridiculous stance.  The *only* difference between these examples and circumcision is that an ancient custom says it's the foreskin we should cut off.  Divine mandate apparently neatly gets you around the logical absurdity of the position.

Plenty of groaning in Syria where Sunnis are murdering Shiites again; or in Indonesia where Buddists are slaughtering Muslims; I don't know how you religious people have the front to even raise a whisper in argument on the point of the suffering religion causes.

I bow to the knowledge conferred upon you by your medical degree and years of OB/GYN practice.

I have no idea why this statement makes ethics a funny thing for you.  It's a non sequitur.  Termination can also be decided by medical necessity, threatening the life of the mother for example.  So your conclusions about ethics, and the premise of your argument are both invalid.

Finally you see the logical absurdity of your position on the health grounds!

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"I understand what you mean, but that way of thinking converts a democracy into a technocracy.  There is _always_ someone more expert than an MP on any given subject.  If you follow the logic then we need no MPs, we just have ""experts"" decide.  If you don't have MPs then you don't have voters.  Worse, if you do simply let the special-interest group decide on their own departments, why wouldn't they always say ""yes, more money for us is the way to go""?

The point is that MPs wield power that is granted to them by the populace over the populace (at least in principle, it's probably arguable that that is still the case in practice), not least of which is the power to ~~extort money by menaces~~ tax, and money is what it all comes down to in the end.  I am absolutely fine with doctors views being given lots of weight _by MPs_; but I'm not happy with the idea that doctors have any actual power.

The populace might well agree with the doctors, and they should make the public aware of those views, so that they may include them in their next voting decision.  A ""vote-of-no-confidence"" by a special-interest group is stupid posing though.  They have not, and should not have any power were a vote makes the slightest bit of difference.

You get one vote, not one vote as a citizen and one extra if you're a doctor.

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"&gt;Is Aaron Lennon of Top 4 quality?

Of course. But being a top 4 player isn't that simple, you also have to fit the system of the team you are playing in (think Dzeko at City, marvellous player but can't get a look in). As AVB trends towards his 4-3-3 I think Lennon will slowly be phased out of the system. In saying that, his pace and ability to keep width make him a huge asset in the squad, in the right line up he is deadly.

For example:

-------- Keeper

-------  Backline

--- Paulinho - Dembele

-  Lennon - Holtby - Bale

---------- Striker

That is a team that has width, and after monstering midfield will very quickly transition into attack. Lennon would be a beast on the wing in such a set up. I don't see that being AVB's favoured formation going forward, but with Lennon in the squad it is an offensive ace up the sleeve.

&gt;Would you rather see Bale on the right, so Aaron squeezed out of the team? (Please don't make this a Bale discussion)

In a traditional 4-3-3 I think Bale would be very well suited on the right, he would essentially play the Hulk role. This would squeeze Lennon out. However, Spurs would be stupid to only have one formation, the only reason we beat city last season was because AVB completely shook up the game plan and bent them over. Lennon adds another dimension to the squad, I think he should hang around for at least another season (in a rotation role, not as a 'first name on the teamsheet').

&gt;Does Senor Lennon fit into AVB's system?

The AVB 4-3-3? No. He needs to offer more in terms of an end product in my opinion. However, I do think his ability to track back defensively is underrated. 

&gt;Are you hellbent on signing a winger? Tom Ince, Bernard, who? And why?

No. Striker first and foremost, probably two. Next window, assuming CM/Striker problems are plugged, I see winger + LB as the looming gaps. It is too soon to throw around names as Siggy/Townsend could very easily be the player we need. Spurs will need a quality creative (Siggy?) and attacking (Townsend?) winger, as well as one with a serious eye for goal (Bale?).


&gt;How do you rate Azza, out of 10?

6.5/10. Given freedom and space he will tear a team up all day, as evidenced by his games vs the Arse (at home) and Utd (also at home). Unfortunately, teams are now beginning to park the bus against us a bit more as our reputation grows. Lennon doesn't really offer a plan B, with no largely creative players in midfield to feed off (Modric, VDV, Mata, Silva, Isco etc) our boys at the front will need to either have a knack for scoring goals, or setting them up. I am not sure Lennon does either of those things well enough.",0,1372152724,null,0,1372152956,0,caprtq0,t3_1gzx0p,t1_caprtq0,t3_1gzx0p,null,1430691286,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

Seriously, do some Googling.  That 2005 report was the first I found.  Approx 2 seconds of Google time.  Whether it's later than your meta-analysis or not, it still found there was no correlation in that population in that time.

Hyperbole, just the sort of bullshit you expect from religious nutters.  Terminating a fetus at a medically appropriate age is not the same as killing babies.  The fact that you equate the two, shows just how far from reality you are.

Which is 24 weeks in the UK.  Where the fuck does this 18 week thing keep coming from?  Yes, that law was created after consultation with people way more qualified than you or I.

Pulling teeth?  It's the most obvious of all positions to take on the matter.

If carrying the baby to full term is likely to result in the death of the mother.

It seems that (and I mean no offence at all here), that American fans are *absolutely obsessed* with formations.

If you went to a pub around Stamford Bridge after a defeat, you wouldn't hear people saying ""Well, we should have played 4-1-2-3 rather than a 4-3-3"" as they can be basically the same thing, or totally different. People will discuss whether a player was too deep or to high, or too wide or not wide enough.

You can play a 4-3-3 with a forward line of Oscar, Torres and Mata and it would be entirely different from a forward line of Hazard, Lukaku and Schurrle.

I've been going to church regularly since I was 18 having never been before then and I often find myself talking with people about why I go to church (I never force the topic). People will often bring up when they go: Weddings, Christenings, Baptisms Christmas and Easter are the big ones.

Personally I think it's a shame as these services are often very different to how church looks on a regular Sunday. What makes the church special is the relationships. Chatting before and after, meeting in small groups, Youth groups, parent toddler meetings, making friends and hanging out. picnics in the park or drinks in the pub after the service. The relationships that develop out of these things all contribute to a sense of community which isn't as evident at the church events that form people's perceptions of church.

I think if people were willing to give it a try other than for special events they might enjoy it. It's also worth remembering that Churches are all very different. In fact the same church can have a completely different vibe in the 9am service vs. the 6pm. Some cater more to young singles, some are more family friendly and others are better suited to the older generation. I know that before I went I had a stereotype of your traditional Anglican service with organs and hymns but the church I attend is very different to that.

I know it's probably what I would pick, given the 4 choices.

I am not willing to say that there is or there isn't a ""god"". If pushed, I would admit that I believe that there was something before the big bang that brought the universe into being, at least while science acquires more evidence of the history of the universe (which happens every day).

But I certainly don't believe in some wise, bearded man sitting on a cloud listening to my prayers judging my actions.

Therefore, I obviously won't pick the ""there is definitely a god"" option, but I also don't want to pick the ""categorical denial of any god or spiritual power"" option either. And ""I don't know"" seems like I haven't thought about it at all, which isn't true. So for me, the final option sounds like ""there might be a greater power or something like that, but it isn't a god anything like what religions say it is"".

For me, that is a rejection of ""religion"". Because to me, ""religion"" is the institution of belief in some sort of god that judges me and I have to please in some way. I don't believe in that at all, so I classify myself as non-religious, yet I do believe that there was some force before the universe appeared.

From reading that article, I do not believe that it was a ""QT special on independence"". Rather it was an edition of QT where a question on independence was going to be asked. Given that there was a panel member from the SNP, it would be bizarre if the topic was **not** raised. The Scottish Green Party's complaint seems to amount to them wanting exactly as much coverage as the SNP. I can understand them wanting that, but since they get far fewer votes than the SNP, I don't think it's surprising that the BBC don't agree.

See. I think think this is another example of the ""blame the BBC"" knee-jerk reaction. The Scottish Greens didn't get what they wanted, so they are accusing the BBC of bias. Just add them to the list of all the other butt-hurt politicians who would really love the BBC to be their own personal propaganda machine.

On the other hand Jesus constantly upheld the Tanakh (Jewish Bible) and it's teaching. He didn't say the Jewish Law should be violated, nor did he say it was wrong. He held to objective truth, but said that religious and man made institutions had got away from that truth.

My suggestion is that when exploring the idea of God it's worth looking beyond those church events.

Whatever your position I don't think it hurts to come along and have the discussion with people who do go to church the worst that can happen is you come away with a better understanding of why you believe what you do having explored the alternative.

When you calculate the hourly rate for some junior doctors, it's not actually that good.  Last year, for an average 48 hours per week, I made about £9 per hour.  This included unsociable hours and night shifts.

found it: http://yougov.co.uk/publicopinion/methodology/ 

They seem to select their sample for each survey from a pre-recruited set of people who have demographical info tagged to them. I guess they have to take into account people those who hate 'surveys-for-cash' schemes and never sign up in the first place. They also weigh up against other sources like the census. ^/edit2

Regarding my opinion about the results, I see myself as Christian, and I fall in the lower age bracket (18-20), but I don't think human religious leaders are relevant in my morals or worship. So I would have also ranked them low, even though I go to church etc. 

^edit3: I am not that startled or surprised about the result, this decline (if it is indeed happening) was anticipated thousands of years ago. I believe that humanity in the future will assume independence, declare itself as a god, and then will face a war with God, which it will lose. ^/edit3

true,potatan,gloucestershire,Gloucestershire,"&gt; With regards to university expenses, are you suggesting that the terms of the student loans and grants system will be changed so that students will be required to pay all that tuition money up front?

No - what will happen is that whatever loan conditions you have now, such as no repayment until you earn over 21k, reduced interest rates tracking inflation, or debts written off at some point - all these are about to be renegotiated in order that the government can divest itself of it's £40bn debt mountain.  By allowing the conditions of the loan to be altered, the loans can then be packaged up and sold off to organisations more willing to take on the (lowered) risk. [Removing the cap would, however, burden graduates with years of extra repayments, lasting in some cases until the end of their working lives. ](http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2013/jun/13/raise-interest-rate-student-loans-secret-report)

&gt;The point you are peddling about bears, boars and wolves being reintroduced into the UK is still an issue being debated and ironed out

Maybe for bears and wolves, but there are plenty of wild boars in Gloucestershire, and the reintroduction has already taken place for [beavers](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/natureuk/2011/05/beavers-are-back.shtml)

&gt;UKIP...have virtually no actual local political power beyond the laughable 219 council seats they hold in local government councils across the whole UK. Out of 21000.

Only a few councils were contested at the recent local elections; if you replicate up to the rest of the country (I realise that extrapolation is a dodgy game..) they end up with about 14% of the local council seats - quite a tidy amount.

I forgot to mention your arguments about the rest of the welfare state looking after the unemployed and disadvantaged, but with all the cuts taking place, these safety nets are being dismantled even more quickly than the NHS.

I feel sorry for the state of the nation already, nevermind what my (grown up) children are already experiencing in their lives and what they will have to put up with in the future.  

Thatcher made us all cheer for lower tax rates; then she started dismantling the state and it's been declining ever since because no government has been brave enough to actually raise taxes to what they ought to be to support a fully functioning welfare state - and I mean corporate as well as income taxes.  This decline has now reached the edge of an abyss and the coalition is about to tip as all into it, at which point we will become pretty much like 'Murica with all its health and social care issues, where those who can afford it are okay, those who can't for whatever reason, are stuffed.

true,HugoRune1965,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; I guess the church has weird and dangerous beliefs, like the idea that marriage is the union of a man and a woman.

No, the weird and dangerous belief is that you somehow have the right to inflict your own religious beliefs on everyone else. If your religion disagrees with same-sex marriage then don't marry someone of the same sex. 

&gt;  'Mrs A' works in a school in a London borough. She began reading a book called And Tango Makes Three to her primary school class. When she realised the book was advocating gay marriage, she stopped reading it. 

Not a very good teacher if she starts reading a book to her class without knowing what it is about.

&gt; She is a Christian and she told the class that there are different views about that issue in society.

There are different views on racial equality in society too, but we don't give special exemptions to BNP members teaching primary school students.

&gt; Another teacher, referred to as 'Mr X' in the evidence given to MPs, teaches in a secondary school in Scotland. He was prepared to teach about marriage and sexuality in a balanced and objective way, but could not in all conscience say gay marriage was the same as straight marriage.

Then it doesn't sound like much of a balanced and objective way of teaching.

&gt;  No wonder a poll of teachers in February revealed that most (56%) believe a teacher would damage their career if they voice support for traditional marriage.

The phrase ""traditional marriage"" is just weasel words for discrimination against same-sex couples. I support equal rights for same-sex couples, but I still support marriage for heterosexual couples too. It's not even the biblical definition of marriage that they are talking about, unless we are allowed to have concubines now.

Beyond the fact that it is horrendous the reason for this campaign is because until recently there wasn't widespread awareness of FGM and people who practice it aren't aware that it is illegal. Most of these procedures are done on girls either in back streets by people who have no idea what they're doing or abroad, which leads to really nasty complications which are often not discovered until they're older and theres nothing that can be done about it. 

So this campaign isn't suggesting that MGM is fine whereas FGM isn't, it is just raising awareness of an issue which is having serious consequences for young girls in this country. There are similar campaigns for Male circumcision as well.

You really can't use Torres as a predictor for the outcomes associated with Cavani, it's too small a sample size and position+price are the only real similarities. 

Lukaku would have plenty of opportunities, we have average 59.3 games per season of late, with three strikers in a one striker set-up and that many matches, the second striker is pretty much guaranteed 30-40 appearances and the third striker around 20. He wanted a champions league club loan or an equivalent number of appearances (similar to what he got at West Brom), which he would be fine achieving in that scenario with scope for more with injuries, versaitility, and/or good form. And who's to say Cavani wouldn't score twice or thrice as many as he might score next season? That one is the hypothetical.

Personally I'm fine with our DM and CB situations, and I think the age profile of our youth in those positions is well suited to transitioning in the future (not too much overlap), but even if I wasn't those positions are relatively inexpensive compared with a player like Cavani (we can still afford them) unless you're trying to buy Thiago Silva or Vidal. And we aren't because we simply can't and because the difference in quality there between what we have and top tier is less than the difference between our strikers and top tier.

I don't have a million dollar so when I hear people buying Bugatti, Ferrari, Lamborghini for 387,000, I be like what the hell no one should pay that much for a car, the same way clubs like Swansea will say no one should pay that much for a player but the second they have enough revenue to purchase players like that they will immediately do. Like I will if i can afford a Bugatti, Lamborghini or Ferrari.

*  Zinedine Zidane £46 = €75 at that time 20 million for a player was seen as outrageous

* Figo £55	= €62

The top 5 highest transfer of all time 4 have been made by Real Madrid and the the was Barcelona. I dont know what sort of mind games Madrid was playing with Napoli but it backfire, Cavani and his parent had already signal his intent to play for Madrid to get a better deal than pay the full buy out clause they try to distant their-selves from the deal by claiming it too high think that Napoli will have to lower their asking price in order to get rid of a Cavain so they shouldnt have the risk of keeping an unhappy player on the roster.

It's very basic self-PR. If you switch teams of course you're going to have to update your pictures in social media or you'll get slated as non-committed.  
  
It's also a given that new player X will always say ""It's a dream come true to play for Liverpool"" when they sign.

Anything other than proclaiming undying love for the club or pride in playing for us would be suicide.

There aren't many things the British do well these days... but one of the few things we are world leaders at is unfortunately SIGNIT - signals intelligence.

It all started during the second world war, when we launched a gargantuan misinformation and spying campaign against the Germans. The massive spy network that was established and backed up by early signals intelligence then evolved during the post-war years throughout the cold war into the monolithic beasts they are today. You have to marvel at the fact that on D-Day Erwin Rommel, commander of German forces in France was expecting an invasion in Calais (wiki *Operation Fortitude* - it's an amazing story even these days) thanks to a huge misinformation campaign. Compare that to the axis forces, who by the end of the war didn't have a single spy in the UK... they were all double agents working for the government!

But for the government projects like Tempora are a big asset. When Obama talks about the *special relationship* he is talking about US access to GCHQ... that is our useful contribution unfortunately.

There just doesn't seem to be any government desire to even discuss this stuff, here or in the USA... god forbid change it.

true,HugoRune1965,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; Let's assume for the sake or arguement that you are correct: that everyone who disagrees with same sex marriage is guilty of homophobia.

&gt; It's an absurd proposition, of course, but let's allow it for the sake of this important arguement.

OK first of all, let's be clear with what is meant by ""disagreeing"" with same-sex marriage. There is a big difference between a person deciding that they themselves will not marry a person of the same sex, and deciding that they have the right to deny same-sex marriage for everyone else.

I maintain that I have yet to see a reson for denying same-sex couples the right to marry that was not homophobic in nature.

&gt; The law of the United Kingdom does not require its citizens to agree with your or my definition of homophobia. In fact, it is perfectly legal to hold views that others would consider homophobic.

The same could be said for racism.

&gt; More than that, the law does not require citizens to keep their opinions to themselves! The law does regulate the provision of goods and services, and that they must not be withheld on the basis of sexual orientation. However, the law does not require its citizens to hold a particular view of same sex marriage. 

The same could be said for mixed race marriage.

&gt; Diversity, by definition, allows for diverse opinions to be held. Employers must not breach this principle.

ok lets run with that. 'i exist' is a base assumption based on what we have at our disposal, our senses, we look, feel and touch etc and for our opinion on that information.

yes is is... based on our way of interacting with our surroundings (our existence) there is not one shred of proof that has been offered up by the faithful that goes anywhere towards 'proving' the existence of a deity.

I wanted to get my daughter involved in such a youth group.  The local church youth groups are all Christian.  The british girl scouts are Christian.  The girl guides are a Christian organization.

The most common reason is called Phimosis.  It is thought to effect about 10-15% of the male population, obviously it is hard to know, as lots of those who discover they are at risk, have a history of male genital multilation in their family.

The worst thing about this is it often presents itself only during the later stages of puberty.  This means as you're developing down there, you are been given a bit of a squeeze.  This isn't good, it also makes the surgery harder.  The accepted NHS cure for this circumcision, but if someone is mid-way through puberty, the stiches and what not make it a lot worse.

Suffice to say, the consultant advised me that if ever I have children I should have them snipped at birth.  But never mind that, tell me how I should be ashamed of a genetic, sadly hereditory health problem.

Yep.

&gt; erm, how does a church stop other youths from having a non-religious social group of any kind? 

Because the churches are often the only large provider of a hall.  The church organizations have a very unfair advantage.

&gt; and there aren't normal places for non-religious people to go to? ever heard of a pub? we're not short of them in this country. 

You were trying to make an analogy.  What's your analogy for a pub?

&gt; &gt; The vegetarian cafe doesn't get tax free large halls.
&gt; no, because it's a business. 

Exactly, which is why your analogy doesn't work.

&gt; churches dominate society? what are you smoking? 

They dominate the youth organizational side of society.

&gt; ah, we're getting to it now. you have a massive chip on your shoulder because of some incident. well stop projecting, it stops you from being logical. 

Lol.  I was trying to give you an example. Clearly I can't win with you.

&gt; so set up your own group ffs. if nobody joins, don't blame the christians. 

The trouble is the large barriers to entry.  The Christians have large halls throughout the country that they get tax free.

Sounds like someone who tried to be successful in the industry and got kicked out and is now decided to be an activist.

&gt;The final point though, is that even if it was proven that the financial sector was actually on net, an economic positive, it is still, deep down, unrewarding. Does the UK want to be a nation of money-obsessed people with narrow skills and no time, or a nation of creative people solving real world problems?

Fundamentally this guy doesn't like the financial industry and believes that it's totally unrewarding, even if it's a net positive he believes we should all be opening up boutiques and carving wooden spoons for a living.

The fuckwit doesn't understand that a thriving economy needs a financial sector just as much as it needs creatives.

For instance, a lot of my Scandinavian acquaintances from a locally fairly broad political spectrum already considered the UK a borderline police state due to the use of CCTV (I don't necessarily agree or disagree here - that is besides the point), so one can imagine what they think of it now. 

Of course, not all people have the same strong viewpoints as our Scandinavian brethren, however, as someone who has a reasonably widespread base of contacts across Europe, I certainly have noticed a change of mood for the worse in terms of people's attitude towards the UK.

Tell me though, is there a real unemployment problem in the valleys or just one of apathy? Is there enough work within 30 or so miles to get a much bigger part of the population working?

I am given the impression that historically, the whole area was a sparsely populated upland farming area. When the coal became big, a huge influx of people came from far and wide to work and live. Now that the coal mining era is all but over, there is a huge population without work. We cannot simply all revert to sheep farming.

Maybe given time people will migrate away from the valleys and leave nothing but ghost villages. 

There was a piece in the Western Mail a few weeks ago about ""lifestyle refugees decimating the Welsh language"" Maybe these refugees could be persuaded to live in the valleys. This would increase property values and boost the local economy, providing local jobs and maybe persuading more people to commute.

I would suggest something like Lovefilm DVD rental, especially if you don't watch many films. I think the best route is to buy and sell discs on Ebay, you can usually get what you want cheaply and sell it on after. The net cost per disc is £1 or so, it's a little more hassle though but you can watch exactly what you want, where as the DVD rental firms always end up sending me films that are 10th on my list.

It doesn't call for all surveillance to end and all surveillance techniques to be disclosed, as you seem to have understood it.

* If you look at the final points, number 1 it just says that they need to follow international data protection laws. Things like how a company shouldn't be keeping your personal data for any longer than it has to in order to provide the service you asked for, reducing the risk of someone stealing your personal data from that company. Basically, the government(s) shouldn't be storing all the information they gather forever by default, unless the information is actually necessary in some way.

* Point 2 calls for transparency. This means that people are unhappy because the very *existence* of the entire scheme was kept secret from the public. When the average Charles Smith sends an email to his wife, he expects it to be private, unless the police have some very good reason to look at it (probably cause, warrants etc). Now we know that the government analysts looked at (or recorded) it anyway, without a warrant or probable cause. They could do this because no one knew they even existed. If you don't know they exist, then you can't hold them accountable if they abuse their power.

* Point 3 calls for an end to *indiscriminate* surveillance, because most people think the government should keep their nose out of our personal lives unless they have a damn good reason to stick it in.

* Point 4 wants the US and UK to sign up to some international standards on transparency that I am not familiar with.

None of these points involve revealing specific details on secret identities, or secret codes, or playbooks or whatever.

I think you'll find that the average person, like myself, isn't so much concerned at the act of surveillance - I am well aware that everything digital I do can be watched by governments if they really want to.

The real issue that makes people nervous, is how these analysts operate in such complete secrecy that they have absolute free reign to use their intelligence gathering capabilities for whatever they like, without anyone catching them or even knowing about it. The problem is the **lack of oversight and the lack of accountability**.

What's to stop one of these guys being paid by a US based competitor to hack my lab computer and steal our awesome British research data for themselves? What's to stop them reading the emails you send to your boss, maybe even *changing* the emails to cause trouble for you? What's to stop them intercepting saucy pictures of your wife and sharing them on 4chan? If no one is watching these guys, the potential for criminal abuse is too great.

Contrast that with the police, who need a court order and a warrant to tap your phone, or look at your records, or search your house. We understand that sometimes the police need to perform covert surveillance to do their jobs and keep us safe. But they have to justify their actions to the judge and the courts and ultimately the public.

true,canard_glasgow,null,null,"&gt;I never said anything about London

It is the general attitude given by successive governments since the 80's. There is a severe brain drain from the rest of the country to London that ends up with a circular situation where all the jobs are in London, so all the talent moves to London.

&gt;The government at the time didn't just decide to kill off large employers just for fun.

It was the rate that things were done. There was many options open to the Government at the time. They could have invested to modernize manufacturing plants to make them more competitive and slowly rolled back support on industries that were never going to be sustainable. Instead they adopted a scorched earth strategy that has lead to inter-generational unemployment in areas left with horrific levels of poverty and social problems. The scars from that time can still be seen today.


&gt;Doing it slowly would just have cost more and delayed the inevitable.

Cost more? I doubt it. Imagine the amount spent over the past thirty years treating the health and social problems that accompanied the long term unemployment, as well as providing direct welfare. Never mind the amount that will need to be invested to get these areas up and running again. 

If the unsuccessful industries were rolled back slower, over a period of ten years, then other businesses would have had the opportunity to pick up the slack and the local economies could have been maintained. The market towns that served small villages such as that featured in the article could have been preserved as more than commuter stops.

80mph is a perfectly safe speed limit for motorways provided conditions are suitable. We have a huge network of dot-matrix signs for variable limits, so why don't we use them?

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"The key difference between the formation of the NHS and this example is that during the formation of the NHS, a lot of discussions took place during the Second World War.

When Labour won the election after the war, Nye Bevan, who was the Secretary of State for Health at that time, took a much more radical decision that essentially was totally different to the discussions during the war.

Before the creation of the NHS, medical professionals were primarily distributed according to regional wealth of private patients with a voluntary hospital system in place for those who could not pay. The problem was that by the time of the Second World War, the hospital systems were struggling to find funding and thus provide sufficient healthcare. This made healthcare reform a key issue during and after the Second World War, given the impact of the Blitz across the UK, but the medical profession was primarily a private venture and had no particular representation within government. The intervention in creating a national health service could be arguably seen as infringing upon the rights of doctors to perform their business.

The medical profession in March 1948 voted 252 to 17 in favour of breaking off negotiation with Bevan regarding healthcare reforms. The British Medical Journal archives have all kinds of letters long before the NHS reforms came in opposing interference in the medical field, with articles as early as 1942, a whole 6 years before the NHS, opposing government involvement.

It's an interesting debate to read because the medical profession was fractured across several lines. Some disliked the interference in the ability for a GP to earn his own salary based on his desire to work and did not want to lose the money he earned. Others disliked the government becoming a party between the doctor and patient confidentiality. Others supported the reforms because it was clear funding was becoming a significant issue. These debates were pretty important throughout the war and after, and it wasn't as clear cut as people suggest.

There was a massive lack of continuity with regards to links between government and the healthcare profession. There were at least four different ministers responsible for overseeing health during the War. The British Medical Association, perhaps in the face of this lack of continuity and the different attitudes shown by the change in staff, sought to have medical professionals in control over the direction of the reforms, which is a stance hard to argue with, and in many cases seemed to expect opposition where no such opposition existed.

There's a lot more to it, but in essence, the vote of no confidence was not so much a rejection of the NHS as it was more a rejection of what the role of the GP would become. There was plenty of agreement on the need to improve health services, but plenty of disagreement on the direction and role they would play in the future.

A lot of books that cover the stuff about the formation of the Welfare State and the NHS should cover things. Charles Webster wrote a few books about the history of the NHS. Two that I have are *The National Health Service: A Political History* and *The Health Services Since The War*. I've got books also by Derek Fraser called *The Evolution of the British Welfare State* which briefly outlines the opposition seen during the formation of the NHS, and there is also a political autobiography by Nye Bevan about his time in the post-war Labour government called *In Place Of Fear*.

There is also a website by Geoffrey Rivett, at http://www.nhshistory.net which contains a lot of information.

What counts in our favour is that he's only got 12 months on his contract and appears to want a move, so won't sign an extension. Celtic aren't rich enough to let him run out his contract, they have to cash in, and if they leave it to January he'll go for far less.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Fuel economy peaks depending on a number of factors for the car, so quoting an average figure is a bit of a misnomer, but I can't argue with that. The air resistance increases with a square of the speed, so yes it is harder to drive at higher speeds because of air resistance. But I'd happily sacrifice a little MPG to get there faster. 

360 miles at 70mph is 308 minutes, the same journey at 80 is 270 minutes, so you've saved yourself 38 minutes. Travelling at 90mph will get you there in 240 minutes, which is a saving of over an hour. 

38 minutes is certainly worth it. 

It's also not 31% more dangerous as you have to factor in things like braking efficiency, as you won't necessarily hit whatever you are going to hit with 31% more kinetic energy. And it isn't that much more dangerous for everyone involved, only the travelling car and whatever it hits. 

So you were caught in traffic and going at 15mph? How is that relevant to my comment? The conditions weren't suitable for an 80mph+ speed limit, thus proving my original point. 

The problem of people getting too close is not a speed issue, it's a driver issue. 

I also don't give a shit about my carbon emissions, if I did, I'd be doing 80mph in a prius. It's also not a higher fuel cost, it's a higher consumption of fuel. The fuel itself costs the same, you just use more of it, but surely that's a bonus as the government collects more tax and duty from you. 

If the majority of people were not capable drivers at 70, every time you went out, you would see multiple crashes from people failing to drive at 70mph. Again, this is not a speed issue, this is a driver issue anyway. I'm all in favour of the police actually being on roads and pulling people over for driving without due care and attention.

Doing 90 in a capable car is no more difficult to control than doing 70. They cruise along quite happily with minimal effort. 

Again, if 80 was the norm, you'd get home 38 minutes faster, which is not an insignificant amount of time, particularly in an evening. 

Trusting other road users is something you have to do regardless of the speed limit. An idiot will be an idiot regardless of the legal requirements, for everyone else it will just be a quicker journey home.

Well, the only recurring villans from the classic series that haven't made a comeback are yeti,  the black guardian, Sil, the meddling monk, omega and the Rani. We're not likely to get the yeti as we've already had the great intelligence, the rest are all individuals (and mostly time lords) so we're not likely to get any of them.

My suspicion would be that the Zygons are next, they have already been mentioned  twice in the new series (including seeing the aftermath of a zygon ship under the ritz) and although they only appeared once, they stood out a bit. Also, they're good old fashioned body-snatchers so there's lots of potential stories there. Also, they built the loch ness monster, which might tie into the Sea Devils, another recurring villain from the old series, but as they're just aquatic silurians, you might say we've already had them.

Really I'd love to see the Kandyman again, maybe unlikely but who ever thought we'd see a return of the Macra?

Nevertheless the point stands. If the indication is for others then *they* need a reaction time (good or bad) to take that indication in. Some people will take it in faster than others - that is the grey area you're having trouble with here. The highway code is only good for so much but on a case by case basis no road is the same road twice - an indication at X miles an hour in X weather conditions will be different to Y miles and hour in Y conditions - not counting *Z* where the driver of the vehicle behind happens to glance down to change their radio station and doesn't see the indication at all for a value of W. 

It's not a complicated principle to understand.

http://www.norm-uk.org/circumcision_lost.html

Many people think circumcision removes nothing more than a little extra skin. However, circumcision removes several critical components of male sexual anatomy. This list enumerates everything currently known to be physically lost after circumcision.

 Alongside these physical losses, it is important to remember that whenever a child is circumcised, by far the greatest loss is his choice to make decisions about his own body and his own sex life when he becomes an adult. 

Further information on the anatomy of intact male genitals, and a diagram, can be found on the anatomy page.

More BooksThe Foreskin which comprises up to 50% (sometimes more) of the mobile skin system of the penis. If unfolded and spread out flat the average adult foreskin would measure about 15 square inches( the size of a 3x5 inch index card). This highly specialised tissue normally covers the glans and protects it from abrasion, drying, callusing(keratinisation), and contaminants of all kinds.The effect of glans keratinisation has never been studied.

The Foreskin's 'Gliding Action'  - the hallmark mechanical feature of the normal natural, intact penis. This non-abrasive gliding of the penis in and out of itself within the vagina facilitates smooth , comfortable, pleasurable intercourse for both partners.

Nerve Endings Nerve Endings

to the Brain
- Fewer Nerve Endings means 
Fewer Sensations Circumcision removes the most important sensory component of the foreskin - thousands of coiled fine-touch receptors called Meissner's corpuscles. Also lost are branches of the dorsal nerve, and between 10,000 and 20,000 specialized erotogenic nerve endings of several types. Together these detect subtle changes in motion and temperature, as well as fine gradations in texture.

Colouration The natural coloration of the glans and inner foreskin (usually hidden and only visible to others when sexually aroused) is considerably more intense than the permanently exposed and keratinized coloration of a circumcised penis. The socio-biological function of this visual stimulus has never been studied. 
The glans ranges from pink to red to dark purple among intact men of Northern European ancestry, and from pinkish to mahagony to dark brown among intact men of African and Asian descent. If circumcision is performed on an infant or young boy, the connective tissue which protectively fuses the foreskin and glans together is ripped apart. This leaves the glans raw and subject to infection, scarring, pitting, shrinkage, and eventual discoloration. Over a period of years the glans becomes keratinized, adding additional layers of tissue in order to adequately protect itself, which further contributes to discoloration.

Penis Size Circumcision means 
Less Penis
- Doesn't that matter? Some of the penis length and circumference because its double-layered wrapping of loose and usually overhanging foreskin is now missing, making the circumcised penis truncated and thinner than it would have been if left intact. 
An Australian survey in 1995 showed circumcised men to have erect penises an average of 8mm shorter than intact men.

Blood Vessels Several feet of blood vessels, including the frenular artery and branches of the dorsal artery are removed in circumcision. This loss of the rich vascularity interrupts normal flow to the shaft and glans of the penis, damaging the the natural function of the penis and altering its development. [1. H. C. Bazett et al., ""Depth, Distribution and Probable Identification in the Prepuce of Sensory End-Organs Concerned in Sensations of Temperature and Touch; Thermometric Conductivity,"" Archives of Neurology and Psychiatry 27 (1932): 489-517.� 2. Netter, F.H., ""Atlas of Human Anatomy,"" Second Edition (Novartis, 1997): plates 238, 239.]

Dorsal Nerves The terminal branch of the pudendal nerve connects to the skin of the penis, the prepuce, the corpora cavernosa, and the glans. Destruction of these nerves is a rare but devastating complication of circumcision. If cut during circumcision, the top two-thirds of the penis will be almost completely without sensation. [1. Agur, A.M.R. ed., ""Grant's Atlas of Anatomy,"" Ninth Edition (Williams and Wilkins, 1991): 188-190. 2. Netter, F.H., ""Atlas of Human Anatomy,"" Second Edition (Novartis, 1997): plate 380, 387.]

Death Every year many boys lose their lives from the complications of circumcision, a fact the billion-dollar-a-year circumcision industry in the U.S. routinely obscures and ignores. 
[1. G. W. Kaplan, ""Complications of Circumcision,"" Urologic Clinics of North America 10 (1983): 543-549. 2. R. S. Thompson, ""Routine Circumcision in the Newborn: An Opposing View,"" Journal of Family Practice 31 (1990): 189-196.]

Emotional Bonding Circumcision performed during infancy disrupts the bonding process between child and mother. There are indications that the innate sense of trust in intimate human contact is inhibited or lost. It can also have significant adverse effects on neurological development. Additionally, an infant's self-confidence and hardiness is diminished by forcing the newborn victim into a defensive psychological state of ""learned helplessness"" or ""acquired passivity"" to cope with the excruciating pain which he can neither fight nor flee. The trauma of this early pain lowers a circumcised boy's pain threshold below that of intact boys and girls. [1. R. Goldman, Circumcision: The Hidden Trauma (Boston: Vanguard Publications, 1997), 139-175. 2. A. Taddio et al., ""Effect of Neonatal Circumcision on Pain Responses during Vaccination in Boys,"" Lancet 345 (1995): 291-292.]

Neurological Sexual Communication Although never studied scientifically, contemporary evidence suggests that a penis without its foreskin lacks the capacity for the subtle neurological ""cross-communication"" that occurs only during contact between mucous membranes and which contributes to the experience of sexual pleasure. Amputating an infant boy's multi-functional foreskin is a ""low-grade neurological castration"" [Immerman], which diminishes the intensity of the entire sexual experience for both the circumcised male and his partner.)",0,1372182868,null,0,false,0,capzqjh,t3_1gyfqv,t1_capzqjh,t1_capzq9s,null,1430687484,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0
