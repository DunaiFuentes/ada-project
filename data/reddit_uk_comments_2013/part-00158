Edit: Sorry I took so long I feel asleep. Now about Rose I think that it was a good episode that helped show people what Doctor Who was about. As I had not watched the original Who, this was my first interaction with the Doctor. I know that a lot of people really don't like the ninth doctor and I see a lot of people being told to start later on because the effects and acting gets better but I still think nine had a good run. As I rewatched Rose I wasn't just mesmerized by the story line since I already know what goes on so I was able to see other things that I hadn't the first time. I started to notice the lower quality of stuff, but I guess I was just used to watching Matt Smith run around with the better special effects. I still feel it was good for the time and  a good episode to start with.

True enough, but folk don't know about it do they? The typical level of ignorance about WW2 is quite stunning and Asia, and to some extent Italy, were almost forgotten threatres of war even at the time. 

In a way WW2 is commonly seen as the Blitz, Battle of Britain, D-Day, Push to Berlin and the camps, and little more - similar in a way to how WW1 is all about Trenches, a game of football at Christmas and awful poetry. I'm genuinely surprised if you're genuinely surprised that most know little or nothing about Imperialism, British or otherwise.

It was pathetic but I had sympathy with the guy, he was getting a bollocking for taking so long since they kept assigning him other jobs while he was clearly going to be busy with this one for some time without some proper equipment.  

Eventually they organised another guy and quietly asked for help from a local farmer with a digger and we got it sorted, still had to fight customer services to get a credit for a month of service though.

If that's the question (I apologize if not), then I believe the answer is No. I think the regeneration is one of those pesky ""fixed points in time"". While it has been referred to as him sort of being pulled out of his own timeline, I believe the meeting of incarnations is STILL part of your timeline. 

HOWEVER, I would point out that the episode Fathers Day (2005, S01E08) shows 9 coming back into his own timeline from a few minutes previous. This could be looked at as a mini-same-incarnation-crossover. In this instance, nine erases himself from existence sort of (one of them disappears). THIS suggests to me that there could be some basis toward the theory that Hurt could be in a different place than intended and die and potentially create a whole new incarnation. This could even delete the history and existence of everything we've seen in the 2005 reboot.

Zab was the heart and soul last season. In so many games he was the only player to show that they wanted it whilst everyone else seemed a bit uninspired.

Plus the man bleeds blue and white. Remember a couple of years ago when his dad was in a horrific car crash, comatosed, and fighting for his life? He flew out to Buenos Aires for only a week, came back, and helped beat the rags in the semi final at Wembley (and he aggravated Paul Scholes so much that Scholes went and got himself sent off). 

I still have fond memories of him kicking Christiano Ronaldo off the pitch when we played Madrid last season as well, I don't think Richards would have been smart enough to hold him at bay.

Also Micah Richards is only three years younger than Zabaleta so I completely reject the ""Zabaleta is getting older"" notion. Just because Zabaleta looks like he's been hit in the face by a frying pan a few times doesn't necessarily make him older than you all say he is.

true,stumbling_coherently,1986,,"Transfer fees are amortization payments based on the length of the new contract a player signs (AFAIK) which is why its interesting to me when the topic of having ""a lot of cash on hand"" comes up. so lets say Bale signs a 4-year, Spurs get roughly 20 mil a year, arguably yes that is a good deal of money, but as it has been pointed out, they've already spent a bit.  Attracting bigger players still ultimately depends on Champions League ball which for the past couple season has slipped away from them through poor luck and inconsistency. 

As far as performing better, Soldado is very underrated IMO, Nacer Chadli is another of the Belgian Golden Generation that looks bread for the Premier League and Paulinho's talent is obvious, his is the biggest of the transition factors though.  All in all these are very good and calculated signings by AVB and all very dynamic players in general.  

Personally they're still somewhat weak in defense, Vertonghen killed it, but its a Dawson/Kaboul toss up for his partner, steven caulker is gone which only leaves Kyle Naughton, I think offensively they're dangerous but there defense will be there undoing especially with the defensive holes in kyle walker's game becoming more apparent. 

Overall I think that Bale leaving would force the team into a dilemma of needing to go big or go home.  His leaving forces the underachieving players to step there game up at the risk of losing it all.  It has been pointed out numerously that without Bales game winning goals last season Spurs would've finished barely mid table.   

I think this is the most talented looking spurs lineups in quite a while with Sandro coming back as well as Dempsey and Dembele (make no mistake both will be integral) and if spurs were smart, they'd take a little less cash and bring Modric back though I doubt that'll happen.

I believe that will explain everything perfectly. 

""In order to keep the half-hour show and the announcement under wraps, the BBC promoted it last week as an entertainment pilot that would pay tribute to 50 Years of Doctor Who. For television schedules they instead listed a repeat of Celebrity Mastermind in the timeslot.... BBC America, meanwhile, have had a repeat of The Eleventh Hour scheduled for Sunday afternoon.""

If it says Eleventh hour - set your DVR to it. I did the safest option and literally set every single who ""episode"" to record just in case there was any mix ups. xD

This is what is showing on my guide (CENTRAL TIME ZONE)
10:30 AM  - 1:00 PM ""The End of Time"" 
1:00 PM - 2:00 PM ""The Eleventh Hour"" 
2:00 PM - 3:00 PM ""The Best Below""
3:00 PM - 4:00 PM ""Victory of the Daleks""
4:00 PM - 5:00 PM ""The Time of Angels""
5:00 PM - 6:00 PM ""Flesh and Stone""

So in case you don't have a dvr, or for that matter a satellite that shows a guide (bc apparently that's a thing) convert the central time to your time and wah-la. You're safe. If I were you, I'd just set your TV to BBCA all day and worst case scenario you're stuck with watching epic who episodes.

true,Jayesar,null,null,"&gt;BT are favourites to hold the naming rights to the new Spurs stadium?

Them and Qatari airlines seem to be the only ones discussed. Spurs demanding £150m paid over 10 years but early whispers are that if spurs get that amount it will more likely be a 15 year deal. Regarding the conflicting interests, I haven't even thought of that and just poured over some spurs discussion and it hasn't come up, so I don't know. 

There are some ties between Bale/BT with him being signed on as a pundit for the next 3 years, he is also all over the new BT adds on loop on TV right now so it probably wouldn't help the relationship if we flogged him off to Madrid. If spurs think holding Bale will help secure naming rights for the stadium it is true that there is essentially no price that Madrid could pay that would land them Bale (would have to be £200m). I would wager that behind close doors the majority of the chairmans effort is going towards securing those naming rights, as that is the one block on current club progression.

&gt;Do Spurs see any of Bale's image rights?

I just re-read the article that gave me the info on the income increase with Bale and it wasn't due to image rights. Instead spurs had a rise to £18m last year in commercial revenue which is expected to increase again as spurs confirmed that number of official supporters groups in the U.S. doubled last season. Spurs earned £2m more in Live TV payouts than Arsenal/Chelsea last season because they were shown so much. Final bit is that spurs lost £31.5m due to not making the CL, if the transfer window ended now I think Bale + new signings would take 4th from Arsenal. That £31.5 + increased revenue + increased fan base + increased TV is quite large, makes you think twice about selling the player when you (in a best case scenario) could make up half the fee just by holding onto him for a year.

I hate this meme.

-ve income tax, or the more traditional benefits, serve ensure people a certain standard of living, something society as a whole desires. It doesn't subsidise employers, who could perfectly well continue to pay shit wages in their absence.

Taxes are best if; they discourage something bad (with externalities) like driving, or alcohol consumption; or when they have minimal distorting effects on the economy. 

A minimum wage fails both of these tests, badly. It discourages employing people, and most would agree employment is good. It distorts the economy by making some people's labour worthless and inflating other's.

It's an economic technique which belongs back in the 19th century.

Very much my initial response. 

1) It was only a relatively fleeting and preliminary discussion last night, but I think you might be right regarding it being a fixed-rate savings and thereby subject to income tax. I'll double-check this evening, just in case.

2) Never having been keen to just take someone's money, I'd be inclined to establish an arrangement with a lender as tenants in common, with my dad, my partner and I each taking on different shares of the property. In addition to this, a deed of trust such that no one party can force the sale of the property. I'm not sure how reasonable an approach this is in terms of point #4 and the possibility that he might want all the cash back at some point in the future.

3) This is something of which I am very much aware. Even if I didn't take the £30k, heaven help my mortgage repayments it we one day return to the double-figure rates of decades past.

I think there is a case to be made for dropping this terminology but it still seems to be very popular and is easily a way to communicate a rough idea of political leanings. 

Looking at America, it's easy to see how the middle is moveable. The US' political spectrum is to the right of the UK's. The Democrats look like rabid Tories and the Republicans are to the right of them. The UK's political spectrum is moving to the right insofar as Blair was the heir to Thatcher and the Labour party did the groundwork for the Tory party's abusive regime. Compared to the 80's when the Labour party was still advocating some sort of socialism, the UK's political spectrum has moved to the right. There is no mainstream political party or even figures who argue for socialism or any way of even curbing capitalism. Where is the left?

It had effective total independence in practice if not in law. It's seats in the lords are available to other religions: the members of the other faiths generally just chose not to take them. And it recieved no funding. 

The ECHR with 50 years of fiercely protecting the rights of faiths is not going to permit state interference in its faith on that basis. 

Critical is that the ECHR generally does not turn on technicalities. It operates on broad principles in keep with the general nature of the convention, and those will never extend to forcing a priest to perform a ceremony against the tenets of his or her faith.

Or, sorry, 'protecting the children and communities', as reddit has some NSFW posts and I've seen links to copyrighted material posted across several subreddits. 

Whatever our PR machine may be, theirs is stronger. Just look at the reaction to the protests from a couple of years back. The overall narrative wasn't ""let us solve the underlying problems that lead to young people behaving this way"" but ""lock up the scum!"" And people believed it. 

I would also disagree with saying that ""nobody is happy"". Perhaps on reddit you will find many like-minded people, but on the streets, I can safely vouch for the fact that I was the only one bothered by all that is happening in my circle of acquaintances. And whilst the 'porn filter' has now ruffled a few feathers, most people I speak to are not only not bothered by the GCHQ surveillance, they indeed support it. 

I don't think protests will work anymore. It's just a way of getting onto a watchlist and hushed up if one becomes too loud. It's very easy to marginalise a group as a 'bunch of extremists'. Hell, did anyone listen to the thousands protesting the Iraq War? Tuition fees? Tax cuts? No - all dismissed as 'lefty lunatics' and promptly ignored. 

The best way I see out of this is to unite behind a political force that counters all that the modern apparatus stands for, in a logical, rational and non-radical way. All it takes is to show other parties that there is widespread societal support for an alternative to the current narrative and I think we would see a shift towards a more sensible direction. But ""logical, rational and non-radical"" doesn't exactly capture headlines. And, more importantly, there is no such force on the scene at the moment.

A couple of problems I can see arising though are firstly not everyone agrees on the issues you've mentioned above. This is partly down to the press polarising opinions, but its hard to have a mass protest when people care about different things.

Secondly, the major problem with mass protest and direct action in this country is that public opinion is generally negative towards disruptive mass protest, again this is partly down to the press but also because people don't want disruption and trouble, all they want is for a nice quiet comfortable life - somewhere safe to bring up the kids, enough money to enjoy some of the pleasures in life, like a holiday once a year.

I am reminded of an artist from Chicago who insisted that the 1984 election had to be rigged because none of his friends or acquaintances had voted for Reagan.

true,yumineko,null,null,"My husband lived in Texas for a year, and then spent long periods in New York when we were in the process of moving to the UK.

First, the US is more diverse culturally than people recognise. Issues he might experience from living in one area, even in an urban setting might be different than another. 

You may need to order food and WATER for him. The word ""water"" is a huge one for some Americans to understand if it is said with an English accent. Americans generally say their ""t""s closer to a ""d"". It doesn't matter if you are in a city or not, native English speaker or not. I get issues here with people not understanding me, especially when it comes to food. I generally order for my husband in the US and he orders for me here. Everything other than food seems a bit less of an issue for some reason.

Speaking of accents, people may think he's from somewhere other than the UK. Don't let him think that the entire US are ignorant yokels if someone asks if he's from Russia or Australia. I don't think that the whole of the UK is full of idiots because I've been asked where in Somerset I'm from, if I miss Australia, or told that someone never gets sick of listening to an Irish lilt.

He will get asked why he is there. He will generally probably have more personal questions asked of him by strangers. It depends on where he's from here in the UK, but generally, American people are much chattier. There are exceptions.

I could go on and on about the differences, but I don't know if it will help so much except to highlight the differences. You could get a few books on British culture. If he's English, I suggest ""Watching the English"" by Kate Fox.

As an immigrant, I have to say that he will need to be prepared to rely upon you a lot until he finds his feet. This is probably one of the most common things transatlantic couples talk about when one finally immigrates. He might feel infantilised by the dependency. He might not. Just be aware that you should try to find ways to make him feel like he is in charge of some aspects even if he doesn't find a job immediately, doesn't understand how things work (like my husband was incredibly embarrassed when he lived in Texas and was teased a bit when he asked where he needed to send his TV licence fee) or manages to build a social network.

But learn to cherish the differences. Let him talk about how things are done in the UK and how it is different than the US. Share your own insights. There's a huge difference between noting and learning the differences and thinking that the British or American way is better. 

As for things to do before leaving:
Take do a crossing with Cunard when he enters the US if possible. Not only is it easier to take more crap with you than flying, but if you fly here and visit ahead of time, you have a nice holiday, can help with shifting his stuff aboard, he will pass the Statue of Liberty when he enters, etc. 

They do a London Pass. I can't speak specifically for the London Pass, but we did the NYC Pass, and it was totally worth it. Look over the website to see if the free entries and discounts cover things he never had a chance to do.

Even if you don't do the London Pass, he should visit Banqueting House and do the audio tour. Amazing amount of history in what amounts to a room, a staircase, and a window. You can get a package with that and a few other castles like the Tower of London, Hampton Court and so on (Historic Royal Palaces).

Look into a good VPN so he can watch iPlayer.

He should travel around Europe as much as possible. From the time he immigrates on, he will likely have his holidays taken up by visits to the UK unless you move here.

Enjoy the time when you reunite. Even though many people immigrate, it is still a fairly unusual human experience. Don't let the common language fool you; there will be adjustments. But he will probably look back on his early days with fondness.

Next - a general adversarial position to the government's policies that's fairly non-specific is just getting into politics really. If you want to protest against each of these individual things, it's probably best to address them individually.

After the tuition fees protests, protests have been conspicuously absent, yes, but I suspect that's in part due to apathy at them achieving little in terms of actual change. I'm not saying it's pointless, far from it, but I don't think trying to centralise opposition to the government's various unpleasant policies will be effective.

1) his knock may or may not be that serious, but he's our best player, and there's zero reason to risk him in preseason friendlies where one stray tackle can ruin the season.

2) We're in talks with Madrid, and they're having us hold him out of training/ preseason friendlies because they don't want to risk him getting hurt in someone else's uniform. Honestly, with the kind of money they're throwing around, Levy'd be crazy not to listen, but again, as we learned with Benteke; it's not a done deal til it's official.

3) Bale is holding out of training/friendlies as a semi-silent protest against our unwillingness to negotiate with Real Madrid. I think the Steve Nash article from yesterday was a good insight into a professional athlete's thinking, and while I will be very sad to see him leave, I can understand why he wants to, and he's going to get us a lot of money.

Gumtree is a good call, as are local markets. Brick Lane market is a hotspot for possibly-stolen bikes. Unfortunately, even if you spot it in a market, there's not much you can do without a frame number to prove that it's yours.

You should look at getting back the frame number if you want a real chance of recovering your bike. Have you kept the original receipt from when you bought the bike? If so, it might be on the receipt. Even if it isn't on the receipt, taking it back to the shop you bought it from might get you the frame number from their records. Even without the receipt, it's worth trying the shop you bought it from if you know the purchase date and have a copy of the card you initially bought the bike with.

Finally, this is a tenuous one, but if you bought the bike on a credit card, you might have some kind of purchase protection included with the card that you don't know about - this sometimes covers theft of new products within some period of the purchase date.

To use an analogy, I own a big house and land in the country but can't afford to pay the bills because I'm crap at finance and spent all my money.

He was really good going forward - better than most of his successors, namely Crowe, Connolly and Peltier; unlike them he could actually dribble with the ball and whip a decent ball in - but somewhat suspect defensively. That said, of the aforementioned successors, only Peltier is perhaps better defensively.

The problem was that his defensive lapses and status as captain led to a lot of people getting on his back, using him as a scapegoat for poor performances (the same would later happen to Howson, but not to the same extent). I think this, coupled with Leeds wanting him to take a pay cut, drove him away.

Would I take him back? In a word, no. His confidence playing for Leeds was shot by the merciless fans (you can tell by now that I thought they went overboard in their criticism of him) and he's not only older but more injury prone than the two players we have at right back already. Moreover, Byram is leaps and bounds ahead of him. Richardson wouldn't make a good centre half and playing him on the wing would see him struggle to get into the game, much like Aidy White.

true,chrisjd,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"I think you are undervaluing peoples Labour. The only reason a business would employ someone on minimum wage is because the value that person adds to the business is greater than the cost of £6.19 an hour, which isn't actually that much. Of course they would much prefer to pay them less for doing the same amount of work, and for the government to pick up the cost for them. But when forced too they choose to pay the higher wage rather than firing people. 

I admit if the minimum wage was high enough then people would start losing jobs, but I don't think we are at that situation now or that we would be if the wage was raised to a living wage of £7.45 an hour. Do you really believe that a person's Labour is worth so little that they couldn't even earn enough to survive by working full time? This is not true, it's propaganda, we are all taught to undervalue our Labour and to believe we are paid according to the value we add. We are paid according to market values, the low paid are only low paid because there are other people willing and able to do their job at the same or a lower rate. A negative income tax would distort the market by making sure people always have enough to live on, so don’t care about being paid very low wages. You talk about taxes discouraging things; you must admit that a negative income tax would conversely encourage low wages unless a minimum wage existed to balance this out.

I don’t know where you get the idea of the minimum wage being a 19th century idea, it was only introduced at the very end of the 20th Century.

true,nikcub,lfc68,null,"Now would be a good time to clarify release clauses. A release clause (or buyout clause) is a section of a players contract that describes additional circumstances under which a player can have his current contract terminated and registration transferred to another club. The usual law post-Bosman is that a player under contract can only transfer to another club once his current club agrees a fee and terms with a purchasing club. A release clause dictates a fee that if met compels the club to release the player and allow his agent to speak to the club that is activating the clause.

Release clauses are mandatory in player contracts in La Liga. When a club signs or re-signs a player you will usually hear about what release clause is contained in the contract. For eg. when Messi recently re-signed with Barcelona his release clause was set at £215M. A team that offers this amount compels the current club to allow him to speak to the buying club. The term is a standard legal term and you see it in financial contracts - a fee that is paid or conditions that can be met for a contract to be terminated.

Release clauses were made mandatory in Spain after the players union took the league to employer arbitration over a case where a club wouldn't allow a player to leave. The funny thing about football player contracts is that under most employment laws they are actually illegal. Each time player contracts have been tested in court decisions have almost always ruled in favor of player freedom.

The first such notable case was *Eastham vs Newcastle United* in the UK High Court in 1953. It abolished the old ""retain and transfer"" system and found it to be a restraint of trade. That decision is the foundation of modern football player transfers, signings and re-signings and most important the ability for a player to terminate his contract and transfer with a fee being paid.

The next big decision was the Bosman ruling, that said a player that runs down his contract is free to sign with any other club. More recently there was the Webster ruling which allows some players to terminate their contracts if certain conditions are met.

The general trend is that players have obtained more freedom as parts of the old system are torn apart after being found illegal under restraint of trade and movement. Football players are no different to any other employees, and most of the western world has employment laws that allow employees the freedom to decide where they want to work (forcing someone to work for 4-5 years as football players do is not legal). 

The current terms are still tough on players as you can see with sagas such as the Modric transfer and now the Bale transfer. These court decisions had an impact Europe-wide but some countries took further steps to liberate player/employee movement in football. One of those was Spain and the introduction of release clauses.

Arbitration in Spain found that a player that wants to move to another club but isn't allowed to because his current club won't accept a transfer fee is against freedom of movement laws. They introduced a new law that mandated release clauses in all player contracts, so if the player wants to leave their current club they are able to subject to compensation being met. Release clauses are decided between the club and player at the time of signing a contract. From the clubs perspective, you want to set the release clause high (high enough that in effect there is no point) but from a player perspective you want to set a reasonable release clause so that if things don't work out they can move on (or take up a dream move to a larger club).

Release clause levels are part of negotiations. Highly paid players will often have high release clauses as clubs want to protect their investments. Up and coming players on lower wages usually negotiate a lower release clause into their contracts (for eg. Thiago at Barcelona, and Verane at Real Madrid each had a release clause of 20-25M until recently). 

So every player in Spain has a release clause, and the figure is made public (or is revealed to other clubs on request). If a bid comes in that matches the value of the clause the player automatically is allowed to speak to the other club (for eg. Bayern met Martinez's release clause and didn't even speak to Bilbao). Most clubs prefer to not activate release clauses since it can damage relationships with other clubs that you have to deal with on an ongoing basis. Even when a release clause is met, it is very often the case that the transfer is concluded as a normal club-to-club transfer at the same value of the release clause rather than the release clause being activated (i'd say 90% of ""release clause"" transfers are of this type). It is very rare that release clauses are activated without the selling club being involved in the transfer (I can immediately only think of three off the top of my head - Martinez, Illarramendi and Figo. Transfers like Cavani are just normal transfer that are just at the same value as what the release clause was set at).

The confusion in the UK arises because release clauses are not mandated there. They are not part of the standard player contracts and nor are they required or sanctioned by the FA or Premier League. Some agents have chosen to include a release clause in their player contracts as a *special consideration*. For eg. Demba Ba. The language and how the release clause works in each of these cases in the UK is different, which raises confusion. For eg. Pere Guardiola introduced what he thought was a release clause into Suarez's contract that didn't end up being a release clause. The other thing with the UK player release clauses is that nobody has challenged them in court or in arbitration, so nobody is really sure if they can be upheld or if they are even legal. Newcastle *could have* challenged the Ba release clause but decided not to, since most clubs prefer not getting into protracted arguments with fellow clubs (which is why the Arsenal £40,000,0001 bid and follow up is such a big deal, its rare for clubs to conduct themselves in that way with each other). 

The only release clauses you can be certain of are those from players in a league where they are mandated. Everything else is more informal and not tested. Premier League clubs are able to purchase players from Spain after meeting the release clause, but in-turn are not obliged to set release clauses on their own player contracts. 

In the case of Liverpool, Atletico and Diego Costa, I would be surprised if this deal is completed as an activated release clause. Liverpool are much more likely to go back to Atletico and negotiate a standard transfer that just happens to be of the same amount that the release clause otherwise would have. 

Even Real Madrid President Perez, who is one of the most agressive MD's in world football in terms of targeting players and signing them, said that a release clause should be a last resort, and that he prefers that Real Madrid do not activate them as it is not worth upsetting fellow clubs or destabilizing relationships over a single player transfer and a few million euro/pounds. You'd prefer to work out player transfer amicably. 

The release clause is also likely not the last we will hear about further freedom to player movement. I really thought the Modric case would set off a new challenge either in UK or EU courts or sports arbitration, but it was not to be. While player contracts may still strictly speaking be illegal, there is a balance that needs to be struck between the rights of clubs and their development of player assets and the freedom of movement of players. This is why it is rare for a football club managing director to outright refuse a player move in the face of a bid and a player wanting to leave. They don't want to end up as *that guy* that set off a court challenge from a player that saw contracts further liberalized. 

My own thought is that release clauses are a good thing and should be mandated and standardized across all football, but that the value should be calculated based on the players wages. If you want to retain a player and increase their release clause then you will need to pay them more. There is also a big problem in football where the only way a player can get a pay raise is by committing to a new long-term contract, which leads to off-contract verbal agreements from DOF's and MD's to players that even though they are signing a new long-term contract, they would be allowed to leave if the right bid came in (again Modrid and Bale, both who are said to have claimed that they only signed new long-term deals at Spurs which involved pay increases under the condition that they would be allowed to leave if a bid came in). Those informal verbal deals need to be formalized, and a release clause in the Premier League (one set against wages or not) is a good way to achieve that.",0,1375444104,null,0,false,0,cbfg2ez,t3_1jjz1l,t1_cbfg2ez,t1_cbff7hx,null,1429971466,30,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,30

true,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"&gt;Leaving the EU [but staying in the Common Market] would mean the UK retains self-determination

*Well* there's complications surrounding that. For instance some countries are part of the Common Market but not part of the EU. They have to implement all the relevant legislation and they get no say in how it is made. They have to pay taxes to European projects which sometimes/often they don't actually benefit from. They do get certain opt outs. For instance Iceland has an opt out on fishing and Norway has an opt out on oil related law but they've opted in to the rest of the economic stuff which means they don't face taxes when trading with Europe in those things *but* if they wanted to stop implementing the legislation regarding any of the other stuff they would have to start facing trade barrier like import/export taxes. (TL:DR they have to implement most EU legislation *anyway*)

The point is, if you 'become independent from Europe' but stay in the European Market are you really that independent? Some would say you end up even less independence because you get so little say in what laws are made and you don't get to help pick the members of the European Commission (like Jose Mannuel Borroso) and you don't get to be in meetings of the Council of Ministers *and* we don't get to elect members of the European Parliament. So we lose almost all influence over the legislative process and are basically left to lobbying in a similar way to the US or a corporation. Keeping in mind we probably wouldn't have anywhere near the lobbying weight that the US has. 

Though I fully agree with you that this is a bad article and does not represent the argument properly. It's resorting to oversimplifying things to make people agree rather than relying on the actual validity of a pro-union argument or the flaws in a pro-independence argument.

Edit: Capital letters where they don't belong. Independence instead of independent. Implement instead of implemented.

1. As someone else mentioned one big thing is soft power. That the Queen has met so many presidents is quite a statement itself and as a diplomat (Prince Philip aside) she seems to do a respectable job.

2. Novelty. In a world which increasingly has elected head of states, many of whom turn out to be corrupt (Berlusconi, Chirac) that we have an institution that has survived for the better part of 1,000 years with only a small break is quite impressive and as the recent birth of Prince George shows attracts quite a bit of global coverage which would probably not be as significant were he not to be the future head of state.

3. If we keep a distinct head of state we'd end up paying someone to do what you have described and chances are they would come from an affluent background much like our PMs. Now, I can appreciate that some people would get a warm fuzzy feeling from voting for the head of state but points 1 and 2 make me think keeping them would be better.

4. The amount of constitutional change required to get rid of them is disproportionate to any potential benefit and there's a whole host of things we could do to make our country and government better without getting rid of them and keeping them as a purely symbolic head of state.

5. ""They spend the tax payers money frivolously"". Spend some time in the public sector and you'll quickly realise that compared to a lot of the waste that goes on £20k on a dress is a positively sound investment (slightly facetious but only slightly).

6. I doubt many tourists come here purely for the royal family but big events (wedding, baby birth etc) probably do draw a big foreign crowd.

There is no evidence for this, at all.

&gt;Novelty. In a world which increasingly has elected head of states, many of whom turn out to be corrupt (Berlusconi, Chirac) that we have an institution that has survived for the better part of 1,000 years with only a small break is quite impressive and as the recent birth of Prince George shows attracts quite a bit of global coverage which would probably not be as significant were he not to be the future head of state.


This is a stupid argument. The attention is as embarassing and negative as it is positive.

&gt;If we keep a distinct head of state we'd end up paying someone to do what you have described and chances are they would come from an affluent background much like our PMs. Now, I can appreciate that some people would get a warm fuzzy feeling from voting for the head of state but points 1 and 2 make me think keeping them would be better.

Ah the typical royalist method for argument: belittlement. Anyone who disagrees with the monarchy is a child. Cute, but it stopped working awhile ago.

&gt;The amount of constitutional change required to get rid of them is disproportionate to any potential benefit and there's a whole host of things we could do to make our country and government better without getting rid of them and keeping them as a purely symbolic head of state.


A simple constitutional convention to rid the country of the monarchy is in no way 'a lot of work'. Saying 'oh its hard' is probably the saddest excuse for not doing something anyone has ever heard.

&gt;""They spend the tax payers money frivolously"". Spend some time in the public sector and you'll quickly realise that compared to a lot of the waste that goes on £20k on a dress is a positively sound investment (slightly facetious but only slightly).


This is a fallacious argument.

&gt;I doubt many tourists come here purely for the royal family but big events (wedding, baby birth etc) probably do draw a big foreign crowd.

A completely unsupported assertion. In fact Versaille, which was vacated by royals in the 19th century attracts *more* tourists annually than the still occupied buckingham palace despite the fact that the former is in the outskirts of paris and the latter is in central London.

In addition, read and memorise every hero's abilities, every single one may be used on you and it is important to note the type of damage they do, a pure damage ability is much more scary than a equal damage magical one. Try and think what you would do if X ultimate is used on you. 

Use the guides selectable in the top right hand corner, they take a little time to load but some of them offer great insight into particular hero's.

The more valuable the land (when imagined undeveloped), the higher the tax. I'd imagine this would replace council tax, business rates, stamp duty, and the other perverse land taxes out there.

The idea is simple enough in theory; land is finite, and wasting valuable land (i.e. urban land) is a travesty. An LVT acts to spur landowners to make the best use of their parcel of land as they can. The tax due on a central parcel of land is the same whether it is vacant, a one floor building or a skyscraper. This would force landowners to make the best, most productive use of the land. Either way, the public receive a benefit from their tax payments, or from the newly constructed facilities and services.

Compare that to today's tax arrangements where businesses are taxed *more* the more they develop a parcel. This ends up with people buying parcels on the periphery, parking it for a few decades while roads, bus routes, tube stations and housing/retail go up around it and eventually cash in when resold.

The only other way to be part of the single market is to be a member of the EEA. EFTA is just a free trade agreement.

Members of the EEA have no political representation or say in any legislation made at the European level.

If Britain left the EU and then negotiated membership in the EEA, it would have to implement laws it did not help create, which would be hilarious since most advocates for leaving the EU make the case for it based on returning national sovereignty and self-determination.

Britain could retain full national sovereignty by leaving the EU and joining EFTA, but it would lose access to the single market.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; I think there is a definite line between wanting filtering for content on illegal things and wanting filtering for legal things (no matter your slippery slope argument).

The child porn filter doesn't even work anyway - no paedophile goes on to google and types in ""child porn"" and clicks on the results. Even if they did back then, they'll now be using things like Tor or IRC or something else - and the filter is useless for that. But what it has meant is that the likes of the MPAA can now go to court and get whatever website they want blocked on the largest ISPs in the UK.

Labour have even more of a reason to not be trusted over things like these - they have absolutely proven that they have an authoritarian streak and there is every reason to suspect something. They also created new laws to ban ""obscene"" content, which was then filtered - scope creep. The Conservatives are marginally better but not amazing.

The exact same arguments that people have against this filter could be applied to Labour's - like the stuff about ""they're using porn as an excuse to get it past the Daily Mail set"" - in Labour's case it would be ""I have no problem with filtering illegal and depraved content"". The end result is the same.

&gt; RE the workfare bill - Labour did not support it. The whip was to abstain (following concessions in the bill) and 44 rebelled and voted against. I know there is a lot of fun in Labour bashing, but we should get our facts right.

Regardless, that's a cop-out. According to parliament.uk, ""To abstain is to refuse to take sides in a vote. However, abstentions are not officially recorded in the House of Commons or the House of Lords."". So abstention in this case helped the bill to pass - had Labour ordered their members to go against it would have been defeated or it would be a much closer result (I don't know the numbers) - and had it still passed, they'd have something good to crow on about. Instead they have absolutely no moral capital in this area.",0,1375447913,null,0,1375448152,0,cbfgr08,t3_1jjury,t1_cbfgr08,t1_cbfgo7u,null,1429971147,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

As someone who worked in the then privatized Pathology dept I can with some authority say it was a hideous failure which put lives at risk. The private company repeated failed to pay, not only is staff on time, but the medical supplies companies who provided the reagents for routine blood analyses, who then of course withheld delivery of vital supplies. The number of staff was cut back meaning that portions of the laboratory work were done by completely unqualified technicians as the qualified members of staff were required to do oncall which meant coming in at 9 in the morning and remaining awake and onsite until the following lunchtime.
The entire lab was hooked up to a computer system that repeatedly went down for days at a time, meaning the entire lab ground to a halt, delaying blood analysis for sometimes days at a time and meaning that any tests done were resulted by hand written forms resulting in incorrect matching of test results to patient notes.
I will now and forever be thoroughly against privatizing any area of healthcare as a result of my years working in that environment.

Could do, but I don't particularly. It was necessary for the human race to evolve past being nomadic hunter-gatherers and it happened before laws on property even existed. When it happened there weren't even any property rights, so it wasn't possible that claiming land was theft.

&gt;I think land is in a separate category because it could be but to better use than it is now, and it's also very unequally distributed at the moment. 

Silver in jewellery could be put to better use making low resistance circuits. Plastics in consumer goods could be put to better use building wave-power geerators. Gas for ovens could be put to better use generating electricity, and that electricity could be put to better use in scientific experimentation and engineering. Everything you own or ever will own could be melted down and reused for something that's arguably better. 

&gt;and it's also very unequally distributed at the moment.

If you have land, you can trade it for goods. If you have goods, you can trade them for land. Land's effectively a commodity, nothing more, and two people can have the same amount in assets if one has 50 acres and the other has £50M- or they can trade with each other and things be the other way round.

It's not at all unique because some people have more than others, the same's true of literally any thing that you can buy and sell. If you start siezing land without siezing assets then you discriminate against people who chose to invest in land rather than in other assets.

&gt;Also unlike other private property it will last forever 

What private property doesn't last forever? Gold jewellery does, furniture does, houses do- something like a car probably won't unless you spend more than it's worth keeping it in good condition, but otherwise nearly everything lasts ""forever"". I have some money I inherited from my grandparents, and they inherited money from their parents, and they inherited money from theirs, and so on, and so on. I didn't inherit land, but if I wanted, I could probably buy some (it'd be a really small patch in the middle of a field somewhere probably, but I *could*). Why should I be better off because my great-great-great-greatetc. grandfather decided to sell his farm and give the money to his son instead of the land?

          The Norwegian government, Anne said, tries to influence
          legislation at an early stage.

Added to if a new law is passed, of which a conservative 30% might apply to the UK, it is not a case that Norway has to simply like it or lump it.  They have since demonstrated, when pushed, they don't have to act on it - as they did when they blocked the EU Postal Directives.   Furthermore, the EFTA Icesave court ruling also goes to show how much room for interpretation EFTA countries have when it comes to regulation.  It's not a case of a ruling appearing via fax.  It doesn't work that way.  The Judge in the Icelandic Icesave case actually ruled that like it or not the EU had no power to determine how Iceland interpreted the application of EU legislation.  Iceland won.

So there's that.

-----------------------

Then I'd like to address what you portray Ukip's argument as.  If I may, I'd far rather see what the Ukip statement actually says rather than what might be a third party projection.  You say it wouldn't fix anything for them, they say:   

               A majority of voters would prefer the UK to be 
               a member of the European Free Trade Association 
               (EFTA) as opposed to the EU, according to a new 
               survey published today by the Bruges Group [conducted 
               by Survation]. 

               Of those expressing a preference in the survey, 
               a clear 71% said that Britain would be better off 
               as a member of the trade group EFTA, as opposed 
               to 29% who thought that Britain should remain a 
               member of the EU. 

               The 71% in favour comprised support across voters 
               intending to vote for all of the major political parties.
               (Conservative 81%; Labour 54%; Lib Dem 50% UKIP 
               95% and others 62%) in fact. EFTA differs from the 
               EU in that it would not have jurisdiction over the 
               UK’s agriculture, fisheries, home affairs or justice 
               policies. EFTA would also allow the UK to negotiate 
               free trade agreements with countries outside of the EU. 

               In addition, Britain would become [a]gain a sovereign 
               nation with more power over its domestic affairs. 

Farage himself has previously said on the matter:   

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXsk0jroOog

Let's not talk in terms of where people would like Ukip to stand so they can give them their best sucker-punch argument.  Let's address where they actually stand, and what they actually say.

-----------------------

&gt;**""We'd be an economic satellite state of the EU, and the EU is large enough to demand some serious amounts of sovereignty in return for free trade.""**

This is just fear speculation.  Here is a list of countries with Free Trade agreements with the EU:  
 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_free_trade_agreements

These countries haven't had to hand over any sovereignty to the EU;    none, and the UK as a net importer is in a much stronger position than many on that list.

We've even got a legal right to negotiate 'without prejudice' under Lisbon and preexisting EFTA signatures outside the EU.

------------------------

&gt;**""Being part of the EFTA but outside the EU frankly isn't a rational option, the current four members of that set are there for reasons which simply don't translate to the UK's situation at all.
Switzerland wants to keep its banking sector away from EU control, Norway wants to keep the profits from its booming oil sector for itself for as long as it lasts, Liechtenstein isn't willing to give up its monarch's powers, and Iceland is in an intermediate state for the process of accession while the fisheries policy conflict is resolved.""**


So all 4 have different, unique reasons to each other to not be part of the EU, but you are arguing there is nothing unique about the UK which might provide a 5th reason?

- Like the UK having the world's leading finance centre and not wanting it to be run/restricted by inferior financial markets on the continent?  

- Or the the UK's shale gas field with projected reserves greater than the US, China and Russia?

- Or the UK's unique demands with regards to foreign policy due to inheriting overseas territories and obligations to them which makes a common European foreign policy unworkable?   

- Or the UK inheriting a shared common culture and language through the Anglosphere and Commonwealth which means the UK not being able to negotiate its own trade deals outside an EU commissioner as being particularly restrictive in the UK's case.

(You might also want to update your information on Iceland - they've had an election since.  EU ascension is a dead fish.)

------------------

&gt;**""In addition, if we leave the EU, we will lose our Schengen opt-out, and considering that all current non-EU EFTA members are part of Schengen, he EU will likely require that as a condition of EFTA membership.""**

The UK signed its EFTA membership twice, once as part of the EU, once as an independent outside of the EU.   

So not only is this an unfounded speculation which doesn't bare true with its other free trade agreements, it doesn't even have a legal leg to stand on.

It's a strange argument to make that by leaving the EU we lose an secured opt out from something associated with being part of the EU!  Especially for a country which is, ya'know, *an island*.

-----------------------

&gt;**""What UKIP don't realise is that if they got what they have been campaigning for in full, they will wreck the sovereignty of the UK far worse than EU membership ever has.""**

Let's summise this.   Weigh up the sides on two scales....

In return for accepting ~30% of regulations, all of which broadly open to UK interpretation, the UK would be entitled to attend negotiations  before it went to a vote and then would still be provided with the option to opt out, veto for itself, which it currently doesn't have.  

                                        Versus

In return for this the UK would get control of its (1) fishing, (2) agriculture, (3) oil and gas fields, (4) much of its employment regulation including the working hours directive which has harmed the NHS, (5) stop the privatisation of the Royal Mail/Post Office, (6) regain a seat on the WTO, (7) pay significantly less, (8) secure the right to negotiate its own trade agreements outside the EU, (9) control of home affairs and (11) justice, (12) leave the ECHR of the European Arrest Warrant and allowing for a new UK Bill of Rights to be formed, (13) retain control of UK foreign policy, and (14) not be pulled into a post-national federal Europe with its democratic deficit.  At the moment if the voting blocs pass a regulation it applies to the UK and the UK can be pulled before the ECJ and a foreign judge if it does not comply.  (15) Under an EFTA court, instead of the ECJ, it would be a British judge who knows British law.

Scales are little lopsided.

Oh, and it appears it would be the democratic choice too, so there's that too, but importantly the argument that leaving the EU would make the UK LESS SOVEREIGN is particularly specious.  It doesn't stand up to any scrutiny, certainly when one considers that the three largest EU voting blocs are all pro-Federalist in nature.",0,1375449244,null,0,1375549165,0,cbfh1ev,t3_1jk1wj,t1_cbfh1ev,t1_cbfgf5s,null,1429971012,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

Actually paying people the money that a court had ordered they were owed? This isn't a case of giving money to fat cats, these are people on benefits and were working for nothing. Labour obviously didn't want to help them.

It's one thing for the government to retroactively amend a law, but it is indefensible that a party that claims to support people like this, failing do it at a crucial moment. I would like to say that I hope people recognise this when they go to the ballot box but based on the polling there's evidently a braindead percentage that will vote for Labour like sheep, no matter how shit they are.

&gt; I'm sure it does work to some extent (albeit not that well).

Too many loopholes. If the content you want is on a site that is on the blocklist, AND if you are with a large ISP, then it will stop you. But it won't stop you signing up to a small ISP that doesn't filter, and it won't stop you getting your fix in many other ways. It is not worth the effort.

&gt; Irrespective of this, there is a massive difference between creating a blacklist of stuff that it would be illegal to own anyway and censorship of legal content (whatever the reason you do it for) for the sake of decency.

I agree that there is a difference in reasoning, but my point is that the end result is the same. Both approaches result in ISPs having the ability to filter, and it opens the door for a government or a court to expand the criteria, change it to be a mandatory compulsory filter with no opt out, or any other condition later on. The Labour filter has proven that.",0,1375449896,null,0,1375459603,0,cbfh72d,t3_1jjury,t1_cbfh72d,t1_cbfh3nj,null,1429970940,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Both because it is correct and because it is practical. As a republican I have many issues with UK democracy and governance not necessarily in order of importance:

1. The influence of royal privilege on power. Just how much interfering is Charles doing to keep his quackery paid for by the NHS?

2. The influence of the church. As we've seen the church is perfectly content to stand in the way of British mainstream politics. Putting themselves on the opposite fence to ordinary ethics without an apology. I feel for them. Their position is untenable and we should exam this relationship so the church never has to defend the indefensible in future.

3. The West Lothian question and the general compatibility of necessary devolution with the governance of England.

4. The contradiction between an increasingly diverse British politics and a system designed to produce a ""winner"". The fact that this winner has a smaller and smaller mandate with each election without proportional reduction in power.

5. The continued existence of the anachronism of the hereditary peers. Who do have a say in parliament unlike the monarch.

6. The lack of legitimacy in the Lords in general. I don't want direct democracy but perhaps we should consider a more diverse system (maybe split the political blocks so that Scotland, Wales and NI get peers selected by the devolved body. With Westminster picking the English contingent. Three applies).

7. The fact key components of the UK system are hamstrung by their illegitimacy. The Lords is effectively a talking shop because it lacks legitimacy. I'd support weakening (but not abolishing) the parliament act if the Lords were made to be more legitimate. To a lesser extent the key powers of the monarch are either non-existent or practically held by the PM. Ideally those powers would be active and not held by the head of the executive/legislative. However this requires that the holder has democratic legitimacy.

8. The insufficient gap between legislative and executive powers. The subsequent legislative rail road that arises from it. Partially this could be neutered by alleviated by more proportional legislatives.

As you can see there is so much that fundamentally smells about our system. True a lot of this involves weakening or redefining the nobility but I see this as a need for a wider reformist movement that looks beyond the mere existence of the monarchy.",0,1375451015,null,0,false,0,cbfhhdz,t3_1jk27z,t1_cbfhhdz,t3_1jk27z,null,1429970804,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

One could argue that is now in the process of changing. Both Prince William and Prince Harry have at least gone out into the world to do something other than just ""be a Royal"" (and not just by receiving an honorary military position), and one would hope future generations will continue to do so.

&gt;They are idolised not only by the UK, but by lots of other countries around the world simply in light of the fact that they are either born or married into the royal family. Neither of which, in my opinion, is worthy of the admiration and glorification which they are accustomed to. 

I agree with you on this. But then there are lots of people who are admired and glorified for doing very little to actually deserve it. It's part of the culture in which we live. 


&gt; In addition to this, they are such a waste of money, especially in this economic climate. Seeing Kate Middleton going to a ball in a £20,000 dress which she'll probably never wear again is disgusting when that money could be put to so much better use somewhere else. They spend the tax payers money frivolously; flying private jet everywhere, lavish holidays, limousines, the list goes on and on. 

In exchange for her having £20,000 dresses and not being able to profit from Crown land, we all pay a bit less in tax. 

That's the situation in essence.


&gt;The only argument which is in favour of them is that they bring in revenue and tourism. But do tourists really come to the UK solely to see the royal family? I don't think so.

Not neccesarily the royal family themselves (although they possibly hope for that too) but they do to see all the associated royal bric-a-brac.

In general if I intrude into legally private space to take a photo it's illegal, but if I take a photo *of* private space from a public space it's perfectly legal. That is, if your garden is next to a main road I can photograph you from it, I break no laws.

Of course UK law has harassment as an offence so if you have a garden next to your main road and I set up shop day in day out to take photos of your crotch as you get in your car, while shouting obscenities at you and rubbing my crotch - then the police will probably be quite happy to get rid of me.

In general though, if I'm not breaking the law by being in the place I am, then I can photograph you and there isn't anything you can do about other than smile.

Lots of little hitlers will tell you otherwise these days though, including the police who've become absolutely atrocious for telling photographers that they're doing something illegal or prohibited when they're not.

&gt; key components of the UK system are hamstrung by their illegitimacy. The Lords is effectively a talking shop because it lacks legitimacy. I'd support weakening (but not abolishing) the parliament act if the Lords were made to be more legitimate. To a lesser extent the key powers of the monarch are either non-existent or practically held by the PM. Ideally those powers would be active and not held by the head of the executive/legislative. However this requires that the holder has democratic legitimacy.

It is infeasible for illegitimate bodies to hold power (at least in the public eye, done quietly with nods and winks you can get homoeopathy on the NHS). The Lords cannot properly fulfil its function while it has no legitimacy. The reserved powers of the head of state are not used correctly while the Queen is not democratically legitimate.

Take what happened with the Iceland deposits scandal. It was a great thing. The parliament of Iceland went against a huge public outcry to pass a bill. Their president refused to sign it, citing the public outrage. That couldn't happen in the UK.

true,Zippy129,null,null,"&gt;frankly we've both proved to be mistake prone and frail at the back.

Not really, no. We conceded the second least goals last season, just behind Man City. Contrary to popular belief, which has been dramatically tainted by a few comedic errors, we are very solid defensively.

&gt;He'd be going to aclub with a manager that, if rumors are to be believed, ddoesn't want to spend big

That would change, surely, if he were to come to us for 50M+

&gt;1.) I doubt arsenal would offer him much more than he makes here

We have substantially more money than you. This does include with the wage bill as well: we can afford to sign 3 players on 220K+ per week, if financial reports are to be believed. In truth, you guys have done a fantastic job trimming your wage bill, and could probably now offer some pretty competitive wages too. 

&gt;2.) He wouldnt be going to a side that's likely to win silverware next season

That would change if we are to acquire him and Gustavo, however. In fact, we don't even need Gustavo, Arteta is absolute class. The only issue is his age, as he isn't getting younger. If we do get him, we will be challenging for the CL. We are actually fantastic in that competition, and if we had a game-changer like Suarez, we could actually have a decent chance despite being *very* clear underdogs. 

&gt;3.) He'd be leaving a set of fans that love him to play at a team whose supporters hated him a year ago

Very true.

&gt;4.) The grass just isn't much greener. He definitely gets one extra year in the CL

I'll doubt you at my own peril, but I don't think you will make the CL next season. No one in the top 4 is really looking like they will be ousted, although I do rate you higher than Spurs as far as your chances go at a crack at the top 4. If anyone absolutely will be kicked out, it is looking like it will be us, but again, with our manager, I seriously doubt that will end up being the case.

true,koleye,eu,American in Britain,"&gt;Isn't it the case that EEA countries have the right to veto any EU legislation? And I'm pretty sure that both the Swiss and Norwegians have diplomats in Brussels to influence what happens if need be.

They do not have this power. They have almost no influence within the actual EU institutions. They are basically told what they have to do per their membership agreements.

&gt;I simply meant that pro-EU'ers cite the EEA as the option the UK would be lumped with if it was the leave the EU - like it's a threat.

It's not so much a threat as it is pointing out that the EEA is objectively a worse option than EU membership. Leaving the EU and joining the EEA is absolutely idiotic. Why should Britain leave the EU, where it's one of the most powerful member states, with a great deal of influence in legislation and policymaking, only to join the EEA and be forced to do what the French and Germans say anyway?


&gt;I'm sure the rest of the EU is tired of the ""wishy washy"" attitude - but isn't that a reason to let the rest of the EU steam ahead with whatever it wants to do and let the countries that aren't comfortable remain in the single market for the benefit of both?

Well the whole thing at stake here is to prevent the UK from making a massive mistake by leaving the EU. Britain's future is inexorably tied to the EU, much like Canada is to the US. Leaving the EU could make it easier for the EU to integrate faster, but it would also resign Britain to a second tier country, which I'm sure some people would be fine with, but it's hard to imagine that the country that created the world's largest empire, and prides itself on special relationship with the only remaining superpower is uninterested in shaping world affairs.

The 21st century is going to be run by the US, EU, Russia, China, and India. The UK can either stay with the EU or fade into irrelevance. Unsurprisingly, I'd prefer the UK to remain in the EU, but if the people really want to leave, then so be it, it'll be their mistake to make and eventually regret.",0,1375453145,null,0,false,0,cbfi2nk,t3_1jk1wj,t1_cbfi2nk,t1_cbfhuvb,null,1429970530,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,bonzoxedge,null,null,"It looks like I'm a bit in the wrong! There was a standard press-conference this afternoon, as a preview for the Kortrijk vs. Zulte Waregem game this weekend. The coach of Zulte Waregem, Franky Dury, didn't show up. Apparently he needs some time to let everything sink. There was however one of the older players (Karel D'Haene) that did show up and talked about the situation. Here it comes: Chelsea didn't demand anything! It's Thorgan's manager, John Brico, who demanded Zulte Waregem to let Thorgan become captain. If not, he would withdraw Thorgan from Zulte Waregem immediately. It seems that he wants to see the market value of Thorgan rise.
Big twist is that the manager of Zulte Waregem knew it from the start that Thorgan had to become captain. It was the task of the coach (Franky Dury) to tell the players. He didn't do it yet, because he thought Thorgan needed some more time to grow in that roll. It's not the first incident between the manager and the coach/team (earlier this season he tried to sell the ""stamnummer"" (don't know how to translate this, it's the basic number every football club in Belgium has and is proud of) and relocate the club to play in another city/stadium, and after that there's been the transfersoap with Malanda).

true,flapjackcarl,lfc99,,"My rebuttal:

Yes, you conceded very few goals, but many of those were individual errors, as you say. I think that still constitutes frailties. If you're solid, except for a lit of costly errors, then you're not solid. Will that be true next season, who knows? But if last season is evidence, it's cause for concern. 

In terms of spending, it's hard to argue that if you bought Suarez you would shatter that reputation. So the argument is someone circular in that regard. He wouldn't go because they don't spend, but if he goes they spend. I'll counter with this instead: does he want to go to a team that's been beat out over small differences in valuations for class players frequently (I'm referring to Mata and higuain)? Maybe, maybe not. That's just my take

1.) And you really think arsenal would offer him 200k+/wk? I find that to be highly doubtful...that would shatter your wage structure. I can't realistically see him getting more than 150, which I think we could match. Not doubting the money is there, only commenting on wengers history of keeping to a rigorous wage structure
2.) I agree that arsenal will be challenging for top 4 next season, but not for actually winning CL. So that would be no change for him. But even with Suarez I don't see y'all challenging the likes of barca, Madrid, bayern, Chelsea, dortmund etc.

4.) At this point in time it's hard to say given that there's a month left in the window. So I won't fight this very hard. But on current transfers, were looking a lot better. Will that be true come September? I won't try and speculate.

&gt; This sounds illogical. How can you oppose the system without opposing the system?

Ah, but you can oppose the system in various ways. 

As I said, starting an aggressive opposition movement online poses several problems already: 

*a)* You are giving the government a precise list of people who oppose your policies to the extent where they are ready to take direct action. You have these people's names, IP addresses and their online history. All you need is to identify the key players and have them either come over to your side or silence them through what you know. Or simply discredit them. 

*b)* An organised group like this gives you a group to vilify and blame. Most people don't use reddit. But most people *do* watch national television and read national newspapers - these are in the sphere of control of the government. Just look at the GCHQ scandal. Ever since the D-notice, there has been nothing in the media with regards to UK spying, with the exception of the Guardian. 

A group like this already puts itself in a very isolated and vulnerable position. It would be so easy for it to become a 'group of hackers, pirates and social outcasts' and for reddit to be banned, due to its pornography, copyright breaches and the spread of extremist ideology. 

A political movement from within the system is much more likely to succeed, in my opinion. There are factions within the Conservative movement as well as Labour (not to mention Liberal Democrats) who are disillusioned with the present system. All it takes is one of these factions getting enough support to be able to influence party doctrine. Or, indeed, a new political force. 

Then it's fighting the system within the remit of the system. That is much more difficult to fight against, as one can't exactly 'ban the system' one is trying to uphold. 

Again - I'm not saying that is the one and only way. It just makes more sense to me. If I had a way, I'd be a political scholar. I'm not.

Let's hypothetically say that no trade agreement is made, that the UK goes completely out on its own, which nobody is advocating, arguing, or without slightest suggestion of it happening beyond some people wanting to put the willies up other people...

...people still get their BMWs and Mercs.  They'd just pay an import/export tariff like the US-EU currently does, so their BMW or Merc would just cost a little more.  

Do they still have fancy cars in the US?  BMWs, Mercs, Porsches, Audis, Ferraris, Bentleys, Rollers and Astons,...

Exactly.   

But that's all hypothetical.  Nobody is suggesting going down that route and it's in no-one's interest, on either side.    

Then again, we could just drop our side of the tariff like the US does compared to the EU and get the cars for the same price.  That leads us into trade talks, as since the UK buys more than it sells, they kinda want us to drop our tariffs - or strike a free trade deal - because we have the best lobbyists in the world a.k.a. their own domestic industries wanting to sell us stuff.

We don't have to go on this carousel of hypotheticals before getting to the meat course of the real EU question: the EU is going towards federalism, it can't do it with the UK present, so how much and do we scale the Norwegian style contributions up by capita or GDP for the UK,  whilst also having a bilateral Swiss style immigration policy with the EU.  We'll still pay towards a common market but not a political union, nor be a member of it.  That's the question.

You sure? He started over Walcott at Euro 2012, and Walcott most certainly *is* an England regular. 

&gt;'the best manager in the league', that's precious.

Really? What makes you say that? Before building our stadium, the board asked Arsene if they thought that it would be a good idea if they would start the construction sooner rather than later, and asked him what they thought would be a realistic expectation for the club during the entire process. At this time, Liverpool were extremely competitive, Chelsea had gone from a club that were challenging, to a club that were winning, United was busy being United, and there were several other quality teams in the league such as Everton and Spurs. Wenger said he would be able to keep Arsenal in the top half. 

So we build our stadium (speaking of which, you REALLY need to get on that if you want to be considered a potential big club for the future), lose our stars year after year (something which I think Wenger could garner a bit of fair blame for, but I do think it is mainly the fault of the board), and rack up mountains upon mountains of debt. What do we do? Well, we continue to finish top 4, continue to breed youngsters, and now we are in a better financial situation than any self-sustaining football club in the world bar Real Madrid, Barcelona, Manchester United, and Bayern Munich. If we can sign some players and push on to win some trophies in the next few years, Wenger's reign at Arsenal will be regarded as one of the most amazing managerial feats in history. Especially considering that every other club that has attempted a stadium expansion has ended up going the way of Newcastle, Leeds, and Portsmouth. 

Oh, not to mention, you know, the unbeaten run and all that. And, tell me, who has won the FA cup more times than Wenger in the history of English football? Oh, and it was pretty sweet that he won us the league a few times. 

Mourinho is an unbelievable manager, I really respect all that he did at Inter, Porto, and Chelsea. Not to mention, he did break a record with RM in fantastic style. Accumulating 100 points in a season might seem easy to us as FIFA players, but it is an other-worldly achievement. He is a frightening manager not only for his tactical nous, but because of the fact that he is a winner at heart. But I don't think he has provided the same level of consistency that Wenger had, and that cannot really be argued against. I do also think that if he were managing us instead of Wenger during our stadium construction, we may have finished in the top 6, but he would have depleted the fuck out of our finances and left us with a far worse foundation for the future. 

&gt;there is probably only one player in the Arsenal team that i'd personally call world-class, if that, and several weak links.

Agreed on the world class bit, but player for player, we are still superior to them. If you go through each position on the pitch, we are miles ahead of them in terms of the quality of starter, as well as the depth of squad, in every position except for goalkeeper and left wing (or wherever the fuck Bale plays). Really, I urge you to compare, I can do it for you if you want, just tell me in your reply.

2) Communism is possible to achieve, but due to the power it invests solely in the state, Machiavellian, domineering, and ruthless people are attracted to positions of power and often manage to seize them. (FA Hayek said this). This results in a communist state which is lead by a dictator. Sometimes these dictators are benevolent, like Joseph Broz (who was a truly good man, even Churchill liked him!), but far far far more often they are power-mad ideologues who will incur any casualties in pursuit of their ideal. Opposition will be denounced as ""fascists"" or ""Wreckers"", or even just an ""enemy of the people"". Long story short, it results in a big brother society.

My current T-mobile plan is £2/month cheaper than giffgaff and is exactly the same as their £10 goodybag with the exception that I have 'unlimited' internet with a 1GB FUP rather than the strict 1GB offered by GG.

The deal I'm on isn't advertised though, I went to a shop and we put the plan together as a means of retaining my custom when my previous contract expired.

My current deal:

* SIM-only
* £8 p/m
* 500 mins
* Unlimited texts
* 'Unlimited' internet (FUP of 1GB, although I've been over 5GB in a month quite a few times and received no additional charges)

The only 'downside' is that it's a 12 month contract as opposed to giffgaff's 30 day rolling contract, but it's cheap enough that I'm not bothered about that. The fact it's a fixed term contract also means they can't go changing it whenever they feel like.

true,Nark2020,null,null,"There's a tension between:

* Their foreign uses in providing a British identity (powerful, stable, historical) when dealing with other countries and bringing in tourists. The monarchy creates a symbol of 'Britain' which can help the country stand out as a place for business people to do business with, politicians to respect, or tourists to visit. The tourist economy is under-estimated but hugely important in a world where the global rich have more money and leisure time than ever before. There's a lot of cross-over between 'tourists' and 'wealthy investors' who are often the same person.   

and

* Their domestic function as making everything that happens (laws passed, policies enacted, wars fought) look as though it's part of a ye olde tradition, part of the fabric of some essential thing called 'Britain'. 

Except 'Britain' is a contested concept - not only re: Wales and Scotland and Northern Ireland, but also Cornwall and the north; and this particular royal family are less than 200 years in the country. The United Kingdom was originally meant to be a 'modern' state when it was formed in the 18th century; much of the olde traditions are actually Victorian faux-gothic and mock-tudor and weren't at the fore-front of people's minds when the UK was formed.   

And all of British politics post-Thatcher represents a radical break from the past - the globalised free market situation with its particular attendant wars is entirely new in many ways.     

So the illusion of continuity and tradition is arguably dangerous, lulling us into a false sense of security and blinding us to what's actually happening. 

TLDR: The Monarchy gives us character but also makes it look like we live in a fixed Medieval-Shakespeare-Victorian fantasia when actually we, like everyone else, live in a world of McDonald's, container ports, coffee bars and internment camps.

Yes, because I know what I'm talking about and the EU openly promotes it as policy!  It's also why the Norwegians ultimately said 'no dice' to the European Postal Directives.

The break up of the Royal Mail and Post Office monopoly and allowing their profitable revenue streams which they used to offset the less profitable routs be open to competition effectively bleeding the natural monopoly through a series of cuts came from the EU over a series of mandatory directives.

EU Directive 97/67/EC     
EU Directive 2002/39/EC     
EU Directive 2008/6/EC      

http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/post/legislation/index_en.htm

&gt;...and the NHS? 
  
I'm saying the Working Hours Directive harmed the NHS, yes.

I'm repeating exactly what the unions and the British Medical Authority warned about.  It means we have junior doctors on wards with less training for longer.   It didn't stop them from working unofficially as they hit the books at home, but it meant they had to spend most of their time on the wards and little time in the classroom. 

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8062314.stm

&gt;You're blaming workers' rights legislation for problems in Britain? 

Some of it, yes.  Take the founder of the UK's 30% Club.  That's a group set up to promote women in the boardroom and in business.  Ironically they're the ones attacking the EU's attempt to introduce a boardroom quota system.  In fact it has prompted the founder of the 30% Club, Helena Morrissey,  to finally say enough is enough and it's now time to leave the EU.   

This is a woman, a very successful CEO in her own right, who campaigns for women's rights in the workplace, who is saying exactly the same thing that I am saying.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/10206639/Enough-is-enough-lets-leave-the-EU.html    

We also have to address EU maternity and paternity rights if we want equality in the workplace too, because at the moment it's extremely skewed.  

I dare say best intentions by the EU, but with terrible results.

&gt;You've listed paying workers less money as a bad thing? Because that's what leaving the EU is all about

Actually, the EU is what's driving wages down.  It's created an hour glass economy (in the UK at least), which also restricts upward mobility, stretches the middle classes, traps the lower classes, creates less paid work, and inhibits efficiency and innovation:

It affects everyone, even if they don't realise it. The way you speak, wht you read, what you do in your spare time... Everything is used in judging your class. I don't even think about it as it's so ingrained in your life.

- Where do you see yourself within the class system?
I see myself as something between lower-middle, my parents are 'technically' lower class but my lifestyle is more middle than lower. Generally people like to think they're lower class than they are (except for the upper class).

- How do you feel about the class system?
It's pretty stupid when you think about it, however it almost goes unnoticed because it's how your life has always been. You don't know any different.

true,shakawhenthewallsfel,lfc12,,"With Suarez, I think the point isn'd so much ""can Arsenal offer more than Liverpool?"" -- obviously the answer is yes, at least in the short run -- it's can Arsenal offer more than someone like Real Madrid.

Because here's how I see it: yes, Suarez would prefer CL to no CL. But what he *really* wants is to be playing a side that's looking to *win* the CL. That's why he's talking about ""one phone call [from Madrid] changing your life.""

Now, he's currently 26, will be 27 in Jan. So whatever club he goes to next is likely to be where he spends his peak years. The grass is greener at Arsenal, but it's fucking brilliant neon green in Madrid (or at Bayern), so I think there's a decent chance that if they don't bid for him this year, Suarez sticks around for a year in the hopes of going to Madrid either in January or next summer.

That's because I think ultimately, he really wants to be in Madrid. Partially for cultural and family reasons, and partially for winning-the-champions-league reasons. If he moves to Arsenal now, he's going to be there for at least 2-3 years, meaning that by the time he's available for Madrid again, he's nearly 30 and is (probably) a bit less appealing.

Of course, this all assumes Suarez and/or his people operate with some sense of logic, which may not be a fair assumption. But unlike some other LFC fans, I don't think he'll stay here even if we *do* qualify for the CL next season, because a 4th place team scraping its way into the CL is not what he really wants. Doesn't matter if that team is Arsenal or Liverpool, he's not going to be satisfied with that.",0,1375455760,null,0,false,0,cbfiwic,t3_1jjz1l,t1_cbfiwic,t1_cbfhxe9,null,1429970141,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Yeah you lost Carra, and that is a loss for the whole of the footballing world, and I myself am sad to see him go. I must say, though, I can personally attest to the quality of Kolo Toure. He was a rock for us during our unbeaten run and he absolutely dominated teams. His play is far from the best part about him though. The man is a model professional. Initially during our unbeaten run, he was the one we were unsure about, and there was a lot of negative press speculation and pressure from fans regarding his role in the team. What did he do? He kept his head down, worked hard as ever, never caused problems, and consistently produced fantastic performances week in week out. Even at City, he was not first choice, but each time he was called upon, he performed for his team and worked hard. If you could have one experienced professional to even come close to filling the boots of Carragher, which he still probably won't, you would want him, John Terry, or Ledley King. That said, expect defensive solidity next season, especially if you manage another signing. 

Now for your signings, I would argue that you weren't in desperate need of players to challenge your starting XI, although they certainly would not have hurt. What you did need was some depth, and you got it. Not to mention, you acquired a hot prospect in Luis Alberto. Nice job with Mignolet, too, very solid acquisition that. If I were in your place, I would be quite bullish about your chances for next season. I can't really see you cracking the top 4, but expect quality outings from your side. I know I will certainly not be comfortable about visiting Anfield, and I will be weary as all hell when you come over to The Emirates.

true,intangible-tangerine,eng-Bristol,Brizzlefoshizzle,"Hell no! 

The most stable, prosperous and human rights respecting countries in the world - The Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden ... are constitutional Monarchies. That's not a coincidence. We tried Republicanism once and it was a disaster. Republics breed polarisation of peoples. It's all about getting 'my side' in to power rather than serving the common good. When we pledge allegiance to the Monarchy we are associating ourselves with something beyond Partisan divisions, an actual tangible institution, not some abstraction like a flag or a 'British dream' that sounds nice but is ultimately without substance. What do Republics have to bind them together other than arbitrary national borders and the bureaucracy of governance? They are subject to the whims of the mob, to the false promises of politicians who hold not only power but also the symbolism of their very country itself. What happened to those European nations that lost their Monarchy in the 20th centuries? The ravishes of Communism and Fascism. Even in those Republican nations that are outwardly democratic the pattern is one of power being dictated by wealth and values being prescribed by elites. The current actions of the coalition government  - the terrible NHS bill et al - are symptomatic of a creeping Republicanisation - with Cameron hoarding executive power for himself and his cronies - casting himself in a Presidential mould acting as if it's HIS government instead of acting as a PRIME Minister of Her Majesty's government. A government which he does not own any more than Milliband does.  

The power of the Monarchy in our system - which is being so dangerously undermined - is not vested in authority exercised directly by the Monarch - but in the authority of those who swear allegiance to an institution which is greater than themselves. 

Judges who vow to uphold the laws and rights of the subjects of Her Majesty. 
Police who swear to uphold her peace. 
Doctors who swear to act in good conduct toward her citizens. 

To have a constitutional Monarchy is to have a relationship between the State and the People which is sanctified. It is a bond made not through lip service to abstractions - but from homage paid to a real living breathing human being with whom the people have a cradle to grave relationship - a person whom they will protect and treasure - not because they are infallible or invincible - but because they are subject, as we all are, to the ravishes of time and circumstances. A Monarch is a nation rendered in flesh. Monarchism is love for one's country tested and strengthened through love of a flawed human being, it is about acknowledging that a nation is not a flag or borders or currency or language or a piece of paper, a nation is a relationship that human beings chose to have with each other and like a Monarch it will only survive and prosper if those people make it so. Loyalty to a country is easily corrupted in to loyalty to political ideology and xenophobic notions of superiority - but the same loyalty channelled through a living breathing Monarch is underpinned by a bond of trust between human beings.  To break a British vow of allegiance means breaking a vow to a human being, to something that is REAL. 

You should not chose to preserve the Monarchy just because it is the pragmatic thing to do, you should do it because it is YOURS. Because you belong to this extended family we call the United Kingdom, the Overseas territories and the Commonwealth Realms. The loyalty that you feel toward your friends and family and your compatriots and all of the people in the world should be the strongest motivator - the driving force making you want to improve the world for yourself and everyone else - and this, the most sacred and most powerful of human drives, is the best system for underpinning a government because it ensures that our higher selves must always be out guides. 

We do not get to chose the Monarch just as they do not get to chose their role. (Although we have ways of getting rid of ones who are not loyal to us as we are to them.) It is an easy thing to be a Republican - to vote for a President who suits your personal tastes and then declare loyalty to them - to be a Monarchist - to swear loyalty to a person who may be ugly and old and awkward - but whom you love unconditionally because you hold a sacred trust with them and through that trust you strive to do the best for the country and the world that you both inhabit - that is a harder thing - but it is a foundation built on stone, not shifting sands.

http://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/about-us/faqs/

&gt;Although the ownership of some property can be traced back to Edward the Confessor, the estate as a whole essentially dates from the time of the Norman Conquest.

&gt;In 1760, George III reached an agreement with the Government over the estate. The Crown Lands would be managed on behalf of the Government and the surplus revenue would go to the Treasury. In return the King would receive a fixed annual payment - what later became known as the Civil List.

&gt;Today, The Crown Estate operates under the auspices of The Crown Estate Act of 1961, which declares that the estate shall be managed by a Board who have a duty to maintain and enhance the value of the estate and the return obtained from it, but with due regard to the requirements of good management.

&gt;The Crown Estate belongs to the reigning monarch 'in right of The Crown', that is, it is owned by the monarch for the duration of their reign, by virtue of their accession to the throne. But it is not the private property of the monarch - it cannot be sold by the monarch, nor do revenues from it belong to the monarch.

&gt;The Government also does not own The Crown Estate. It is managed by an independent organisation - established by statute - headed by a Board (also known as The Crown Estate Commissioners), and the surplus revenue from the estate is paid each year to the Treasury for the benefit of all UK taxpayers.

&gt;To explain further, one analogy that could be used is that The Crown Estate is the property equivalent of the Crown jewels - part of the national heritage and held by Her Majesty The Queen as sovereign, but not available for her private use.",0,1375456490,null,0,false,0,cbfj5hh,t3_1jk27z,t1_cbfj5hh,t1_cbfhgvp,null,1429970026,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I can understand this is probably to do with the little boy that drowned in the old pool.  I'm 6'4 and the deep end of the fun pool only came up to my neck, in the old there would've been a foot or two below me.  But in the whirlpool it is especially noticeable. When I stood in the whirlpool it only came up to just below my waste. It was really quite awkward having to curl up into a ball and walk around the loop, especially if you go when it's busy.  

The blue and green flumes are pretty intense. I've been to a few waterparks on holiday and been on all the flumes and had no problem. These surprised me though.  They should probably use mats, my back was getting scratched on the way down, but it probably won't matter once they get worn down a bit. Red is more suitable for kids but I saw some tiny kids brave enough to go on the blue and greens.  The blue is all about speed, they have a little clock timing how fast you went through it. (I got 12.5 secs, record for that day was 12, all time record was 1.1 which I don't think was genuine for some reason.  Red and green flumes have effects you can choose at the entrance. I can't comment because the greens effects weren't working when I was there. The reds were working but I was unable to select anything because they use the durable touch screens you sometimes get in museums that you really need to pound.  I just went down quickly because I felt awkward standing there.  

Diving pool was also a bit of a disappointment, because you couldn't get on the 2nd board as it faces the exit for the yellow flume.  In the old one, the flume overlapped with the top   diving board, which worked well as few people use it, and it was only open for the last half hour before the pool closed (as far as I know). Tbh I never saw if the top board was open.  

Training pool was standard but at the moment it is divided into tight lanes to deal with demand so I can't criticise it for that.

Overall it's quite clear this is a pool designed for children.  I don't actually feel any desire to go back.  It also feels like it was just poorly designed when it comes to space.  I wondered how they were going to cope with the lack of space when it was built and the answer to this is that they haven't really. I feel like if you are going to spend £31 million on a state of the art pool they should've found a better location and designed it better.",0,1375457005,null,0,false,0,cbfjc68,t3_1jkgv5,t1_cbfjc68,t3_1jkgv5,null,1429969939,2,false,dundee,t5_2sh1y,2

As for induced seismicity it will be less than that caused by coal mining for instance, an upper limit on any tremors is around 3 on the Richter scale, not enough to do any damage and barely able to be felt.

It also wasn't too long ago that I remember watching Wilshere outclass the Barcelona defense at home aged 18. Dembele is quality, but so are Cazorla, Ramsey, and Ox. Ramsey I love, especially, as he was an absolutely crucial part of our squad for our 12 game unbeaten run at the end of the season with his unmatched work rate and his never ending pressing. I do rate Lennon, but not over Walcott, Ox, or Podolski. I certainly rate Sandro, I think he is great, it's a shame he is prone to serious injuries. But Arteta is better. Arteta was one of the best passers in Europe last season. In fact, he may have been the best, I will check Opta later tonight. I also think the defensive side of his game is criminally underrated. He is not too good at the physical aspect of defending, but he is my favorite player in the league to watch from a standpoint of the technical aspect of defending. I do also rate Gylfi, but he had a bit of a poor season and we can expect a marginal role from him next season.

You forgot Rosicky. And come November, you may be sorry that you did if he can stay fit. He was another indispensable member of our starting XI as we mounted a challenge for the CL with a 12 game unbeaten run at the end of the season. Zelalem is also one to look out for, even though he is 16. 

There is also a man named Abou Diaby still on our books somehow, who certainly has something to offer if he can stay fit, which unfortunately he won't.

Ox did start in Euro 2012, but lost his place after the first match and only featured as a sub from then on. saying *'He started over Walcott at Euro 2012, and Walcott most certainly is an England regular'* is actually pretty annoying, you could have looked for yourself to see that was only the France game, but instead you make me say it. at the moment he's a squad player with potential, and a fair amount.

as for Wenger, yes, all that stuff was great, but it is in the past. you're only as good as your last game in sport, and for the last few years Arsene Wenger has seen his best players leave, failed to win trophies and kept a decent financial situation going for Arsenal. not a bad achievement, but not the best in the league by any stretch.

But, I'll elaborate on that for you. Turan was also injured a lot this past season but, whenever he was playing he was always a livewire. He's probably our 3rd best player overall in the team I'd say, I'm sure some other Atleti fans would argue with that but I can say he's no doubt one of the top 5 best players in the squad. Costa, though, was most definitely our best player this year. He blew everyone away by how quickly he rose from obscurity to one of the most talented attacking minded players in Europe.

Lennon is definitely better than Ox right now. Ox will be a fantastic player for years to come, but right now Lennon is streets ahead. I think Walcott's the only English winger above him at the moment; him and Cazorla are the only advantages your midfield has over Spurs.

I think if Sandro stays fit, he is on par with Arteta. Because he's played so little lately people tend to forget just how good he is. I like Arteta, but he makes poor decisions in high pressure situations, and is liable to some pretty bad individual errors. I can't fault his passing though, I agree with you there.

If he loses value, I don't think it would be just 1 or 2million, but more likely a drop by about 50million.

Spurs need to consider the risk that this could happen and balance it against the potential chance of reaching CL if he stays.

I personally don't think that they will make it to the CL even if he stays and cannot imagine how him staying would generate much revenue for the club (a want-away player is not likely to help shirt sales that much).

If spurs get an 80m offer, I am fairly confident they would take it.",0,1375459148,null,0,false,0,cbfk417,t3_1jii44,t1_cbfk417,t1_cbf4724,null,1429969507,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

Anyway, I wouldn't be surprised if we don't have a fix starting XI next season. Mata, Hazard, Schürrle, Oscar and KdB are all on a very high level and all deserve playing time and while Hazard and Mata may still be individually the best of these 5, they are also the 2 with the worst defensive workrate so even if we'd bench them that wouldn't make us really worse as a team.

true,NobilityScooter,null,null,"Gunner here. This is the fairest assessment of the Suarez situation I have read, from either perspective.

If he comes to Arsenal, he boosts our hopes of winning silverware/being competitive in CL. But realistically, Arsenal would still be long way off being a true top-tier squad.

If he stays at Liverpool, your progression since BR took the reigns will continue, and your new signings will only help bolster your chances of a top 4 finish. But, being realistic again, those chances are no better than Arsenal or Tottenham, it puts all 3 teams on a very level playing field. 

Ultimately, Suarez belongs at a truly elite side, and neither Arsenal nor Liverpool can offer that for a number of years. Like you say, there may well be CL football for Suarez at Liverpool or Arsenal, but let's not kid ourselves, we're not likely to win it any time soon. 

From the Arsenal perspective, the only way we can become an elite side is by making such marquee signings, but we (well, the majority of Gunners) are under no illusion that Suarez alone would give us a genuine shot at the title. It would simply be a big step in the right direction.  Similarly, from the Liverpool point-of-view you cannot afford to let a player like Suarez go to a rival, as Arsenal's transfer dealings over the past few years have brutally shown.

Personally, I tend to agree with you that Suarez will hold-out for a move to Madrid in January / next summer.

true,hexapodium,null,null,"That would inflate prices massively and create a perverse incentive to never buy property - since supply of land is fixed, price elasticity of demand is high (observe, modern London). If the LVT can be commuted into an attachment on the sale price of the land, then it will just add on to the seller's 'desired' asking price and drive it up (on mortgaged properties) or inflate rents (on rented property, making it harder to leave rented for owned property). 

A better option would perhaps be to offer significant discounts on LVT owed on main dwellings under a price or use threshold, and perhaps on owned commercial premises under a certain size as well, which would insulate those who get maximum use out of their property (ie, by using it as their home or small business) while penalising those who leave it vacant or under-used. This still leaves the problem of rent inflation due to price elasticity, which can only really be stopped by making building houses profitable. It might be best to deal with this by making the LVT progressive on expected value - i.e. land is taxed based on the expected value of any planning permission currently valid, or else on the expected value of whatever the best-case option in the local development plan would be expected to return plus ten per cent (to incentivise developers getting planning permission, developing the asset and then putting it into use, receiving effective discounts at each stage). You'd then have to have some sort of punitive tax fund (reimbursing that 10% levy and some of the rest) set up by government to reimburse buyers of the properties outright, in order to keep prices at initial sale relatively constant.

An LVT isn't, in principle, a bad idea (it's probably much better than all the other options), but it does create serious issues in mixed rental/ownership situations because it's tied into such an elastic market. 

Oddly, the Bedroom Tax is a form of resource underutilisation/land value tax, except that it's deeply regressive and misidentifies both aims and needs (you can't move social housing tenants into one-bed housing that doesn't exist; misidentifying 'underused' rooms which are actually needed, etc).

I'll admit that burning effigies of a priest, particularly the one you were referencing, is mostly undefendable and is the product of people who truly are what you are accusing me of being, and mostly organised by other organisations that are not affiliated to the Orange.


You made as lot of accusations there so I'm going to address them.

Sectarian.
All Orange doctrine and ceremonies discourage sectarianism, but it does have a certain set of beliefs that most others are incompatible with, such as Catholicism and Islam and other non-reformed Christian faiths. Freedom of religion is important and something to support and maintain as it allows everyone to practice, study and critique their faith. Forced religion is no religion.

Racist.
Well Foli Bruce, past Grand Master of Togo, would disagree with you, currently Mr Bruce is in the UK having to leave Togo due to religious/political persecution, and was involved in platform proceedings during the twelfth and Scarva.

Sexist.
There is a women's order, however demand for women's lodges has always been lower than men's. It there was a greater demand this would change, but at the moment there isn't.

Catholic hating.
Well we do disagree with them on religious grounds but nowhere in the order is there any encouragement to hate them, individual members may have their own views on the matter but it would have been learned elsewhere. The order simply couldn't exist if it were, the order is strongest in rural areas, a lot of out members are farmers who simply couldn't operate if they were bigoted, many get their Catholic neighbors to do the milking on the twelfth, its how the country has worked for years.

Bigoted?
Where one would judge someone based on an aspect of their life despite having very little knowledge on the subject? When a learned individual with intimate knowledge of the matter presents a point that is country to your views, you can just dismiss it because of who they are despite having not met said person. Yes bigots exist but its not because of Orangism.

I think the boss really rates Giroud, but I think he is looking to use him as a 40+ appearance squad player rather than an undisputed starter. Podolski will be playing predominantly on the left, but I do think the boss with give him some chances through the middle too, but our lone striker system really doesn't suit his strengths through the middle, which is undoubtedly going to hinder his performances there. 

As for Ramsey, it is tough to predict what his role will be. Towards the end of the season, Ramsey was indispensable and starting every game over Wilshere, but Wilshere was coming off the back of a 6 week ankle injury, so he was gaining fitness. It is really tough to speculate the extent of his role and whether or not he will start over a fit Wilshere, regardless of how good he is. But, these are good problems to have after all. On the other hand, he might be favored over Rosicky. It all really depends on training, I think, everybody seems to be doing well.

If a person worked 48 hours one day, then not again for a week, it would be fine within that part of the WTRs. The rule about not going over 48 hours a week (averaged over 17 weeks) is pretty strict in that employers can face criminal charges if their workers do, but employees can opt out. In theory they can't be made to, in practice they are.

However, the main thing here are the [rest breaks](https://www.gov.uk/rest-breaks-work) rules; for every 6+ hour shift an employee is entitled to a 20 minute rest break. They have a right to an 11-hour break in every 24 hours of working time, and a right to a 24-hour break every week (or one 48-hour break per fortnight).

However, these have to be claimed, and while they cannot be denied in theory, in practice employees may be forced not to use them.

I really hope your next sentence doesn't exactly describe that there must be competition and the Royal Mail-Post Office monopoly shouldn't be broken up.

&gt;...They state that there must be outside competition 

There it is.

&gt;I'm not talking about boardroom quotas I'm talking about everyday rights

Same thing.  You just don't want to talk about *these* everyday equality rights.

Am I to understand that I can't post anything that makes your argument look bad.  Are those the rules now?

&gt;the working time directive is for most people very good, 

But not the people I mentioned, or the people they serve i.e. everyone.   

So the question is then why we shouldn't have a UK tailored working time directive?  A one size fits all European solution doesn't work.  It also hamstrings SMEs and favours corporations.   

&gt;An article that starts by saying unions are bad and a torygraph article,

So I also can't cite any arguments in EU-sceptical publications now too, lest the ad hominem?

&gt;Economics isn't a science 

It's a social science, which is the best we have.   It might not be too great predicting forward, but we can certainly say that the current situation is causing an hour glass economy, because we observe it happening with a surplus of skilled labour for unskilled work.

&gt;you cannot say the EU is driving wages down with certainty

I can say a lack of controlled immigration is, and you certainly can't say the EU is driving the real term wage up, not when the CAP and energy policies are most definitely making things more expensive!

&gt; I can also post articles that support my viewpoint.

THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING!!!  That's how we actually discuss the issue instead of dancing around it.  That way we can actually identify any erroneous thought.

&gt;That it will cost us a huge amount of money to leave and continuing trading with the EU and we'd have to follow product regulations anyway, just we'd have no voting power.

Between 10 and 30% if we use existing EFTA models, whereas we currently have 100%.  We have minimal voting power because the UK isn't represented well in the major voting blocs, we would however have much more room for interpretation (thanks Iceland for the example), and  a workable veto for ourselves (thanks Norway).

Your economist article makes its argument with what it describes as, 

         ""If Britain walked away entirely—the most extreme scenario""    

Exactly what the submission argues, exactly what nobody is arguing, and then it doesn't portray it as all bad - but it does mean regaining sovereignty, control of our courts, all outside the Economist view.  It later tries to qualify this line of inquiry of saying we might go down a more Swiss model, but would probably not get the exactly same deal.  Again, nobody is arguing this.  That's why they call negotiations.  It doesn't mean we couldn't negotiate a UK deal, and as the Economist argues, even in the worse case scenario then it's not all bad - without taking into account the other non-Economic perks.

The Economist article then says,  

           ""If Britain were to join the Norwegian club, though, 
            it would remain bound by virtually all EU regulations,""

Well that's not true.  Even Norway that has voluntarily opted into some regulations isn't beholden to that.  Iceland is about 10%, the UK would be looking at ~30%, plus since the article was written Norway has used its veto.

The game has changed since the article.

          ""Norway has to swallow almost every regulation that 
           comes out of Brussels, despite having virtually no 
           power to shape them, they will waver.""   

Wishful thinking.  I've just quoted an anti-EU Norwegian politician who is quite happy with the deal and argues the opposite.  That by the time it gets to a vote the politicking has mostly been done, which Norway is involved in, and then they still get the veto - which they've since used.

            ""The most likely outcome would be that Britain would find 
             itself as a scratchy outsider with somewhat limited access 
             to the single market, almost no influence and few friends.""


This is exactly what we see here.  Fear-touting speculation but with nothing to back it up.  It completely ignores that it wouldn't be in anybody's interest, that the UK already has an EFTA signed agreement outside the EU, that the UK would be able to strike its own deals outside the EU which it is eminently placed to do, and that the EU has a legal obligation to enter talks 'without prejudice'.

And the elephant in the room?  

            ""once departed, it would be all but impossible to 
             get back in again.""

The article all but ignores the direction the EU is moving towards: post-national federalism.  There's absolutely no political or democratic  impetus to go into EU Federalism.  It's arguing the EU as maintaining a status quo - it's never done that.  It's always been pushing for more and more integration. 

The article is plagued with omissions, least of all the political aspect, but it hardly portrays a doomsday scenario for all its polarisation.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"       The British Geological Survey today estimates that the 
       amount of shale gas trapped in the North (the so-called 
       Bowland shale basin) is 1,330 trillion cubic feet. This would 
       be the biggest figure in the world. As the graphic below 
       suggests – America has 682tr, Argentina 774tr and China 
       1,275tr. These are the ‘technically recoverable’ amounts of 
       shale, and the BGS estimate is for total UK capacity. 
       “The proportion of gas that it may be possible to extract 
       is unknown as it depends on the economic, geological and 
       social factors that will prevail at each operation,” it says.

       This leaves open an intriguing possibility: that Britain could 
       become the Saudi Arabia of shale. To put this figure into
       perspective, if only one tenth of our shale were recoverable 
       it would still be enough for 50 years of UK consumption, 
       according to the Global Warming Policy Foundation.

I brain farted Russia (although they're still not put in the picture), but I was on the ball remembering US and China.

Let's not split hairs,    

For little Britain it's absolutely huge even if we low ball.

On top of that, the favourable reputation the UK has always had with other member states has helped to acquire opt-outs for those areas where the immediate effect of integration was perceived to be too detrimental.

Even when you are only talking about economic effects, you already have one of the biggest and richest markets at your doorstep with only small hurdles complicating trade. The farther removed your trading partner, both in terms of geography and regulation, the more expensive trade becomes. 

On top of that, while it is smart to diversify in terms of who you are trading with, you are more likely to get good conditions for trade from a new partner when you have a prospective market of 500 000 000 people to bargain with instead of only 50 000 000.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"I'm going to be honest here and say I will continue to miss Modric more than I will ever miss Bale. Of course I appreciate Bale as a player but I never quite warmed to him as much as most Spurs fans I interact with. I suspect that is largely because I'm not British so I don't really get attached to domestic players any more or less than foreign ones. 

Luka for me is a pure player who is often and unfairly construed as a mercenary. He came from nothing and worked his way up to being a world class footballer, and that's basically all he cares about: playing at the highest possible level of football. 

Bale is harder to know, if that makes any sense. We have the anecdotes about visiting his mom and being with the same girl since childhood, but that's about it. Modric has an honesty and passion about him which manifested itself in both positive and negative ways, but everything Bale ever says feels like it goes through a PR representative. 

Luka once said something along the lines of ""Barcelona? I would love to play there, but in the Champions League for Tottenham."" It was naive but it was heartfelt and not manufactured by some agent. 

The closest Bale will ever get to saying something like that is ""Yeah I'm enjoying my football, the gaffer's got the best out of me, I'm happy at the club."" He's the master of the trained wishy-washy cliche that always leaves room open for any outcome. 

From the plastic surgery to the new hairstyle to the trademarked logo to the commercial deals, Bale is emphasized as a marketing tool just as much as a world class footballer. This is a key reason he will likely be sold for almost triple that of Luka in spite of the latter being every bit as talented and important. 

Luka's behavior during his departure can't be ignored of course, but when you contrast it with Bale right now it almost feels like more of a difference in strategy from the players' camps. 

Luka was (unfortunately for us) always very open with his intentions. He used the Suarez approach of courting interest in public and answering the questions asked of him. 

Bale's camp on the other hand is dead silent, which one might expect from a group much more focused on image. Yet where are all these stories coming from? Are we going to stay in denial and pretend ostensibly reputable papers like The Independent and The Guardian are literally just making shit up? They are being fed information to print. Maybe Madrid are doing it, but if that's the case and Bale is opposed to a move, where is the counter information?

I think ultimately both players wanted to join the exact same team for different reasons. Ironically Luka will always be considered the mercenary when it's Bale who is very much the groomed poster boy trying to maximize his marketing value.

Given this is coming from guardiola, it puts paid to that nonsense rumour about arsenal needing to be officially in the CL.

I would still argue for keeping him despite his desire to leave and rejecting any potential transfer requests. A sulky Suarez at Liverpool is still better for Liverpool than a scoring Suarez at Arsenal and £40m.

true,aeisenst,num5,,"I think people are underestimating the importance of the signings we've already made this summer. One of the reasons that Bale looked so amazing last season was that the entire rest of the offense was useless. Between Defoe and Ade, only 16 goals were scored. Assuming that Soldado is what we hope, and he can put together 20-25 goals on the season, a lot of pressure is taken away from our wingers.

Besides the now-patched problem up front, we saw serious issues in the midfield. Moussa is great, and Sandro (while healthy) is great, but we had nothing for a third midfielder, forcing us to play Dempsey on the wing, and swing Bale inside. Adding Paulinho gives us one of the strongest midfields in the PL, allowing five legit attackers in the box on attack (Striker, 2 wingers, Paulinho and Moussa on the edge). Again, we can split Bale's contribution over these players and still improve.

So, even if we don't sign a replacement, I think this team is better than last year. We took two bonafide weaknesses (striker, central midfield) and replaced the with strengths, while taking our biggest strength, and replacing it with passable. Hopefully, we'll make a real replacement for Bale, like Lallana, that will replace world class with very good.

4-4-1-1/4-2-3-1 formation that focuses on pressing high up the pitch and moving the ball around quickly. We are quite vulnerable at the back to teams that are composed enough to withstand our relentless pressing.

##Players##

**Obvious choices**

*Schneiderlin:* In my obviously quite biased view he is amoungst the very top defensive midfielders in the premier league. Positions himself well and wins the ball back at the best rate of any player in the premier league last season (interceptions/game + tackles/game). 

*Lallana:* Came through our youth system around the same time as Walcott and Bale but stayed at the club through League 1. Great technique and has been for several years the key player in our midfield.

**Choices that are less obvious**

*Cork:* Plays exceptionally well but is overshadowed by Schneiderlin so gets less mention than he should. A great all round midfielder.

*Lambert:* Has had great seasons since we bought him in League 1 and stepped up well to the premier league. How much he fits in with Pochettino's plans is uncertain and we have been linked with several strikers to replace him so his position is not the certainty it has been the last few years. Still a great striker lumbered with the false idea that he is just a lethargic target for crosses.

*Boruc:* After a nervous few few games he showed up big time to help us stay up with several key saves when our defence pulled the all to regular stunt of falling apart. Going into this season knowing we have an actual choice for goalkeeper from the start will make a big difference.

##Fan's (my) Perspective##

The club is on the way forward. After going into administration and dropping to League 1 the speed of our recovery after the Liebherr buyout has been outstanding. Cortese has made some unpopular decisions but ultimately his decisions have helped the club get to where it is now. We have made a couple of good purchases in the transfer window and I am still hopeful for 1-2 more. Our team is still ridiculously young: Shaw (18), Clyne (22), Yoshida (24) Schneiderlin (23), Lallana (25), Cork (24), Wanyama (22), Ramirez (22), Rodriguez (24) and will only get better. Pochettino brings an exciting style of football to the club and I feel under him we can finish in the top 10 this season.",0,1375473243,null,0,1375473703,0,cbfppnn,t3_1jk4lu,t1_cbfppnn,t3_1jk4lu,null,1429966893,7,false,SaintsFC,t5_2tboa,7

What you need to realize is that you can't dance around a word in the hope that it will stop being offensive. The gay community needs to take that word and do to it what the black community did with ""nigger"". Embrace the word. Use it as a term of endearment. Show the world it doesn't bother you. A word is only as offensive as you make it. 

Sitting around and getting buttflustered at people using it in a non-homophobic context doesn't accomplish anything.

That's a fair point. Some people do struggle with conveying their meaning but threatening to kill/rape someone is taking it to a whole new level. If that's their starting point then it probably points to some deeper violent streak in them rather than a poor grasp of language.

I think it's in favor of Tottenham here. Modric was great last season but in the beginning he was called out as a flop (along with Alex Song) by Marca during Modric's slump. 

If Madrid DO spend the reported 100M+ for Bale, I'm sure Levy can use the money wisely to build a title challenging and CL-ready team for Tottenham. I think some Arsenal fans at /r/soccer said it best, Spurs with 100M is more scary than Spurs with Bale. 

There are also reports that Di Maria and/or Fabio Coentrao plus money will do it for Bale's transfer. Tottenham will get two world-class players plus sufficient amount of money to get 2-3 more players.

I recognize that you are not calling your gay friend a faggot (good for you).  But, again, the word faggot is a derogatory word for a homosexual.  So, in your long journey to find an appropriate word to describe your silly friend in a negative context, you landed on the word faggot, which if you don't remember, is a derogatory word for homosexual, and still is.  

Your substituting faggot to mean something negative is offensive to many gays, most gays, and I can speak for them, which you cannot.  You may harbor no ill will against homosexuals, and I suspect that is the case, but the word you're using, and yes, the way you are using it, stems from a homophobic culture.  Society would not have adopted faggot in that context if it meant something positive.  You may not find it homophobic, but your opinion doesn't really matter, because homophobia affects other people, and NOT YOU.  So, stop being a self-involved jerk, take into account how other people feel, and stop using the word.

Or don't.  Tell the gays with pride that you use that word frequently amongst your friends.

Costumes had been made, fittings done, we were heading towards the first photo call - mere days before the first day of filming. We had a different look altogether, a bit more pirate-y, big long coats and all that stuff - and Matt hated it all, so we knew we were in trouble. He hated everything. On the last day - in the last half an hour of the last day we could make this decision - he asked if he could try this jacket. I think it was his, this old tweedy jacket with elbow patches. So he put that on, and he liked that, he liked his tweed jacket and his elbow patches. Then he said, 'Could I try braces?' So he put the braces on, and I'm thinking, 'Yeah, that's not bad.' It wasn't spectacular, it was just okay.
&gt;
&gt;""And then he said, 'Can I have a bow tie? And I said, 'Absolutely no. Under no circumstances are we having a bow tie! It's retro, outdated, ridiculous, it's a pantomime idea of what Doctor Who is like. We are not having a bow tie!' But Piers said, 'Just let him try it with the bow tie.' So we stuck a bow tie on him and it just looked fantastic. Instantly! And you could tell that he, for the first time since the costume fitting started, was leaping around the room pretending his pen was a sonic screwdriver, and absolutely believing it! Beth [Willis, the third executive producer] had popped out for a while, so we got her back and I thought, well, 'Surely we've just gone mad, so let's see if Beth thinks this looks okay.' She came back in and she loved it. Girls sometimes just smack you round the head and say 'No, you can't wear that, it's ridiculous!' But she didn't - she loved it, too! And that's the reason I signed off on it that day. I mean, he's a clothes horse, Matt, he looks good in anything. But he just stood there in the other costumes chewing his lip and looking miserable. When he wore the bow tie and the braces and the tweedy jacket he was honestly jumping around the room with his pen going 'Fzzzt!' being Doctor Who.

This is what I saw and in response to what you are saying I said well I don't see why we would have to sell as we aren't obliged to sell. What else would you like me to say? Yes there doesn't seem to be a lot of interest outside of Arsenal right now so yes they would give us the most money. Do I think we would sell for under 50? Honestly probably not. Rodgers would spend the money and we can't get a single replacement because we have no CL to offer, hence why most fans want to see Suarez stay regardless and give it another year especially if we add Costa now.

And here's the team I think we'll line up with:

---------------Kenny

Peltier---Lees---Pearce---Warnock

---------------Green

Murphy-------------------Varney

------------McCormack

--------Hunt-------Smith

I don't really know who he will play with on the right, because Austin is a dead cert to go there once he's available, but for now it's either Norris, Tonge or Varney in my opinion. McDermott doesn't seem to rate Norris and Tonge is too slow, while Eddie Gray thought that Varney might start on the wing, saying he's the only player he believes could do well there. With that in mind, in addition to my belief that he really wants to start with Hunt but knows he can't drop Varney, I think it will pan out this way.

It could be either Smith or Poleon up front, but I think that he'll go for Smith because Poleon is still inexperienced and inconsistent, while I believe that he will know what he's getting from Smith. Just my opinion, but it could go either way.

Then, the FA cup claim isn't much, given Wenger's longevity; compared to Chelsea's recent form it's irrelevant. Then, this continued top 4 claim: the only challenges have been since city forced their way in. The two most recent years have only fallen to Arsenal because of a stunning end of season turnabout coupled with spectacular Spurs collapses and (in one year) an outstanding season from you-know-who. 
The stadium is lovely and really unlike any other I've been to. However, there has been no inclination of enhanced expenditure from the club. The bids for Suarez are far below his value (so ambitious for an entirely different reason than many people think). 
Mou is less consistent than Wenger, but all of these 'inconsistent' years have seen his teams do better than Arsenal on every front. It's not just his doing, but worth noting. 
Finally, the Spurs squad. I think the squads were pretty close in quality last year, but with the additions of Paulinho, Soldado and another £100M of players they seem incomparable.

A person has to give between 7 days and 3 months notice before cancelling an agreement to waive the 48-hour restriction, and you have to let them know in writing (which is sensible because once you're back within its scope, the employer can face criminal charges for letting you work more than 48 hours a week).

A dismissal where the main reason is related to not signing a waiver (or not agreeing to vary or extend one) is [automatically unfair](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/18/section/101A) for the purposes of unfair dismissal in the ERA, and in such cases things like the requirement for having to work there for 2 years before being able to claim for unfair dismissal.

I strongly think this country's a melting pot, a melting pot which might be starting to get a little too hot. Perhaps this will all die down with our/my generation as we get older and the older lot die off, however if it continues as it is, we're headed on a path of death and destruction.

People are angry about these 'gangs', people are angry about the MSM's failure to report on these gangs, people are angry about the ghettoisation of whole sections cities and people don't see anybody listening. 

If, and it's a big if, we do see a 'wave' of successful terrorist attacks (or a sufficiently large one) in the future, I fear for many law abiding, normal people of this country.

true,podpool,null,null,"""I had a chance to leave last year,"" said the England captain. ""It was for a club in the Champions League, not a Premier League club, but I wasn't tempted. I've been through that before.""

Gerrard refused to name the interested club but it is understood that it came from Bayern, who ended the season as European champions. Now Gerrard believes that that level of interest in a player then aged 32 should be instructive to Suárez. Arsenal are the only club so far to have bid for the disillusioned striker and Liverpool will not countenance selling the 26-year-old to a Premier League rival for £40m plus one pound.

The midfielder explained: ""That is the message for Luis. Move on if you want, further down the line, but a player of his calibre should wait for the big one to come to him. He deserves to play for one of the best teams in the world, a Barcelona or a Real Madrid. They will come calling for him again. I am hoping from a biased point of view that he gives us another year and shows us the form he did last season. Maybe it will be time for him to go next year or the year after. I don't think it is the right time for him to go just yet.""

Gerrard admits Liverpool's prospects of ending a four-year absence from the Champions League next season rests on the Uruguay international. ""What we can achieve this season depends on whether he stays or goes in my opinion,"" said the midfielder, who fears the divide between Liverpool and the top four could become permanent without a recovery in the near future.

""That is my main worry,"" the 33-year-old admitted. ""I think that is the main worry for every Liverpool fan. It is no different for me as a player. The only difference is that I am in a position to do something about it on the pitch. I am sure all genuine Liverpool fans have that same concern and worry – that it becomes permanent and we can't bridge that gap – but we've got to keep fighting.

""I have confidence from looking at the last six months of last season that we can prove people wrong and break into the top four. But certain things have got to happen to help us do that and one of them is the main subject on everyone's lips – Luis Suárez. If we lose him we are taking steps backwards. If we keep him and add to him we will have a much better chance.""

Liverpool have bid £21.8m for the Atlético Madrid forward Diego Costa but, with several big money targets missed out on, Gerrard insists the club cannot afford to sell Suárez, who has three years remaining on his Anfield contract. He added: ""Can you imagine the reaction if the club just allowed Luis to go and to go to one of our rivals? Imagine the reaction around here if they just gave in easy. I think the club are doing the right thing by wanting to keep their best players.

""Look at Tottenham's stance on Luka Modric and now Gareth Bale. They don't make it easy for sides who want their top players and we need to do the same. That sends out the right message to supporters. It shows the supporters we mean business, that we are capable of challenging, and the only way to do that is by keeping your top players.""

Equally, Gerrard believes Liverpool have to demonstrate their intent to Suárez by landing major targets even in the absence of Champions League football and amid fierce competition. He said: ""The club has a responsibility to attract top players and to make all our jobs easier in trying to get back in there. I know they are trying their best to do that but what we have to accept is that there are other big clubs out there offering big money, and if they bid more than you there is nothing you can do.""",0,1375481434,null,0,false,0,cbfspfl,t3_1jkwr4,t1_cbfspfl,t3_1jkwr4,null,1429965427,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Either way, I don't think he's going to Arsenal. Suarez' people have already agreed that the contract as written and signed by both parties doesn't not say that a bid over 40 million means he can talk personal terms.

So, he'd be arguing before the CAS, that a verbal agreement was made on top of the written agreement. The club is not going to agree with that. It's word vs. word and Suarez doesn't exactly have that great of a reputation, but he does have a history of breaking rules and fighting outside the bounds of the agreements he has signed to get a desired move.

I just can't see a rational arbitrator ruling in favor of Suarez in such a dispute, particularly when he would be trying to force a move to a direct and immediate rival for a Champions' League spot. His camp has to see that, which is why I think he won't hand in the request.

true,TandAQandA,null,null,"&gt;I agree again. It's mad how many, assuming we believe the police, terror attacks there would have been had our intelligence services not been doing their jobs. I count at least ~10 plots since last year being publicised.

And how many people are even aware? What few people even buy a newspaper quickly turn it over and read it back to front. The BBC is full of tabloid shit about 'slebs.

&gt;I strongly think this country's a melting pot, a melting pot which might be starting to get a little too hot. 

But it really isnt though. BME are concentrated in their own areas they have colonised, those natives who dont like it grumble to themselves and move. Most cockney speakers now live in Essex. I have been saying this for at least a decade, wembley/harlsden has been ethnically cleansed.

&gt;People are angry about these 'gangs', people are angry about the MSM's failure to report on these gangs, people are angry about the ghettoisation of whole sections cities and people don't see anybody listening.

Few people are angry, mostly because most people never imagine it happening to their daughter because their kids are not known to the social services/police and go around doing drugs and getting pissed with 40 yr old men when the parents have no idea where they are.

Noone cares what the working classes are whingeing about, they are all bigots according to the champagne quaffers in islington. The head honchos in labour dont give a fuck, demography is destiny and the votes lie in the ethnic enclaves, the rest can be bought with welfare and shitty cooncil jobs, their principles do not override their love of benefits.

And if the natives get uppity all their texts/emails/facebook is logged along with heGPS on their mobiles and facial recognition will soon sort them out.

true,Colinfucius,lfc99,,"This will get buried, but the fundamental flaw here is that football supporters are so excited about potential signings that they do not care to look at the reasons whether another club would want to sell. They think, ""He is perfect for our squad and we've offered his value. That means we *deserve* him.""

Papadopoulos would be perfect for our team, but would the player even come here? No comments from him whatsoever. Does Atletico want to sell Costa now that Falcao's gone and he's a fan favorite? Even if we've met a release clause (which can be dubious and unreliable, as we've just seen turn in our favor), does the player want to live and play in a foreign culture with no CL football? We have no idea. All that matters is we get to fantasize about these players and our perfect starting XI. Fuck whether they're even for sale in the first place, because we love our club, so why wouldn't they?

Everyone wants the same thing in football. Consistent CL appearances and trophies, leading to long term success and international support, all the way until you can claim you're the best club in the world. We want it, Arsenal wants it, Mansfield Town wants it. It's a zero sum game, and giving away talent within your own league can be devastating if you are trying to build a program.

This outlines my exact problem with Arsenal supporters. They refuse to look at it from our position for even one second. Aside from the fact that they haven't even met the player's value by a *long* shot, they feel like they **deserve** him because they never spend money, they want him, and Suarez wants out wahhhh wahhhh wahhhh.

If they could take *one* moment and pretend they're in Liverpool's shoes, it becomes immediately, blatantly obvious why we won't sell. 1) He's our best chance at top four, 2) We're competing **with** Arsenal for top four, 3) Even with a giant mountain of money, we cannot attract this level of talent this year, 4) Time is running out in the window, and with so much talent already snatched up, there's no way in hell we're letting last year happen again, 5) If we hold out, it weakens our opponents! Players are slipping by while Arsenal twiddles their thumbs, and that's *perfect* for us.

Alas, they refuse, despite how simple this logic is. Every single word out of our organization's mouth echoes exactly what I just said. If Suarez really takes this all the way and puts in a transfer request, we would still rather have him go on strike than play for Arsenal, and that's the truth.",0,1375482574,null,0,false,0,cbft3q8,t3_1jl5xd,t1_cbft3q8,t3_1jl5xd,null,1429965240,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7

If we win 38 games by scoring 1 goal per game and conceding none, we win the league regardless of whether Suarez is at Arsenal or not.  Their position is of little consequence- how our team performs and it's results are paramount. 

Has Suarez taken us up the league table?  Did he take Ajax up their table?  No to both.  Us: 7th pre-Suarez.  7th with Suarez.  At Ajax: 2nd and 3rd with Suarez (and out of the CL, I might add, which is very unusual for Ajax).  Post-Suarez:  1st every year since.  All a coincidence?  Perhaps, I suppose.

I also believe you're making a what I would consider flawed assumption that Suarez would help them move up the table while not considering that ANY decent striker could potentially help Arsenal up the table and, if they can afford Suarez, they can most certainly someone other than Suarez.  It is not the case that if they don't get Suarez they can't still improve anyway but it is likely the case that if Suarez stays as LFC we will not be able to improve beyond the squad we have now.   

In summary:  if we keep Suarez, we cannot improve beyond what we have and we likely have a PO'd player on our hands.  Whether Arsenal gets Suarez or not, they can improve regardless.

true,bazz725,null,null,"Hi Growlbot,

Firstly, loving the team reviews, fun and interesting content, far beyond the normal and simple things you'd find. So, on with the fan content:


PLAYERS


The legend, le legend, le God that is Le Tissier. Can't mention Saints from the 90's or 00's without mentioning the man most people alive today would probably rate as our best and player. A unique style of immense skill, an incredible shot from anywhere on the pitch and just an overwhelming appearance of laziness. Type in Le Tissier top 10 goals into YouTube and enjoy sheer brilliance.


Worth mentioning in terms of historical are also players from the late 80's and 90's who went on to become huge names, such as Shearer, Keegan or.... others that I can't currently remember because it was before my day, or at least I was too young to remember.


Current players we're proud of obviously include those bought through our youth system, especially Lallana who is the only one to have stayed with us from his ""batch"" of youth players, and of course the currently much praised Shaw. Ward-Prowse looks to have the potential to be a great CM, though a key aspect of that role is usually a calmness and control that come with experience.


Ricky Lambert. Talisman striker, if you know Saints atm then you know him, along with many others he's a prime example of the England international system being biased and/or broken, and it's happened with Saints before, such as Crouch when he was with us, or Beattie, or even le tissier in the mid to late 90's. If Torres is worth 50 million for getting his goals last season, then Lambert for 1 mil is a steal, having now scored over 100 goals for the saints. Also, in a manner similar to me tissier, has beastly penalty taking record for us, not sure of the precise numbers but pretty sure he's still not missed one. More reason for England to take note.


I'm going to forgo Schneiderlin talk, because his praises quite deservedly get sung a lot in /r/saintsfc, and also /r/soccer, and instead mention Cork, who if you look at closely enough, you notice that following his return from injury, we started performing outstandingly well compared to our season start, and also statistically performed better than Schneiderlin in the second half of the season in terms of tackles and interceptions. Missing the first few months through injury means he is often overlooked via statistics and the like, which favour Schneiderlin.


MANAGER


Pochettino has bought an attractive, attacking, high tempo and high pressure game to the saints, which hopefully with a full pre-season behind them the team will have mastered to a good level ans maybe overcome some of our weaknesses from last season. As a person I'm in two minds because Adkins was simply a nice bloke thrown out and replaced with a relatively unknown foreigner who didn't speak a word of English and is only known in England as the man who have away a penalty against Owen in the world cup. 


A word on Adkins also, a man who I think most saints fans will agree was extremely harshly treated in terms of his exit and deserves nothing but the best from here on out as a manager because of what he did for us. However I'll always get behind the new manager, and the new play style and tactics are very nice and fun to watch, so I'll support Pochettino as long as he's around, which for the sake of stability I hope is a while.


THE CLUB


Something few people remember is that before our relegation in 2005, we had been a top flight team for 27 years. Lowly Southampton of the 90's were perhaps the equivalent of Wigan. Lots of great escapes from relegation, punching above our weight in terms of transfers, despite cashing in on our best youth. The relegation and subsequent low point can be said to stem from just never reinvesting enough in the squad. Despite building a shining New stadium, a quality player or two might have gone a long way.


Of course no review of saints will skip the youth centre, but it's something that deserves to be mentioned as much as possible. Counting only players in say the top two divisions, you could quite easily build a full and decent quality team of pure Saints FC youth. Obviously including Bale, Walcott, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Lallana, Shaw and Ward-Prowse, but also players such as Chris Baird, Andrew Surman, Nathan Dyer and others.


St Marys is a very nice stadium, 10 years old now and still looking shiny and new, regularly filling up to capacity with the return to the premier league, but often being amongst the highest attendances while wallowing in league 1 and the championship too. Season ticket prices remain quite high for the level of the league we were at, relative to other ""bigger"" clubs and such.


What I will say now is that the following are my opinions alone and not necessarily representative of all or even most fans. 


Having the Leibherr family funds is doing wonders as is the business sense of Cortese, however the chairman has shown himself to be temperamental, while also alienating some of the club's stars. He runs things as much as the manager, and definitely has a lot of the final say in the signings, especially when it come to the bids, so a good relationship between manager and chairman is key. 


I think the future is very bright for us. With the youth in the team, and the young talent we seem determined to bring in, we are building a squad that will progress strongly, and hopefully to Europe, in my opinion in a couple of seasons thanks to the investment behind us at present. This investment has finally also allowed us to say no, we won't sell our best youth off, and therefore we can nurture and also benefit from our own players that can do so well.


Personally this summer I would love to see a top notch striker join our club, along with a good providing attacking midfielder to go with Ramirez and Lallana, adding completion and depth. We have a constant stream of youth coming through, and seeing maybe one break into the team per season would be great, more obviously even better, and as such whenever I talk about transfers it is always assuming that although good, not all players coming through our academy are Bale's or Walcott's, and outside talent is still necessary. All in all very happy and hopeful time to be a Saint.

EDIT: A slight side note of disgruntlement for me is our home kit this season. A poor attempt from adidas that is just one of their £10 shirts with gold stickers for our badge and sponsor on. I'll support saints whatever they wear, but that doesn't mean I can't feel both disappointed and insulted by this kit adidas have given us.",0,1375484143,null,0,1375487348,0,cbftm2g,t3_1jk4lu,t1_cbftm2g,t3_1jk4lu,null,1429965003,3,false,SaintsFC,t5_2tboa,3

Last season we generally went for a 4-2-3-1. It was a fluid formation, easily morphing into 4-4-2 when needed (Jay Rodriguez moving up to play alongside Lambert). Pochettino likes his teams to press high up the pitch, attempting to slow down counter attacks with pressure on the ball. It's great when it works, but can leave us vulnerable at the back - the sight of midfielders running with the ball at our unprotected defence was all too familiar last season. Schneiderlin and Cork are crucial to this system, with Schneiderlin's quick pressing and Cork's defensive positioning. It'll be interesting to see where £12m man Wanyama fits into this equation.

I think we'll stick with these tactics this year, particularly as a lot of fans hope for Gaston Ramirez to have a better season this time around, now he has a full pre-season under his belt. 

This leads me nicely onto players. If Gaston plays to his potential we've got an absolute diamond on our hands. No surprise seeing as we took him from under the noses of Inter Milan/Spurs/Liverpool. He could be huge for us this year, however if he doesn't start performing I expect to see him on a plane to Italy sooner rather than later.

Another player hoping to catch the eye this season will be Emmanuel Mayuka. Influential in Zambia's winning Africa Cup of Nations team, he did absolutely diddly-squat last year. He's looked much livelier in pre-season and will be a useful option on the wings or up front. Blistering pace and with a cannon of a shot, whenever he has the ball under control the opposition defence should be scared. Unfortunately it is a rare sight so he has left defenders fairly untroubled until now. 

Look out for Maya Yoshida at the back. A player who grew into the season last year, and became a class act. His partnership with new signing Lovren will be very important.",0,1375484901,null,0,false,0,cbftupu,t3_1jk4lu,t1_cbftupu,t3_1jk4lu,null,1429964891,2,false,SaintsFC,t5_2tboa,2

In that respect, I haven't really seen a massive difference between now and last season. It's just, as you seem to suggest, now we interpret it in a certain way. 

Sure - he didn't celebrate a goal. A *friendly* goal. If I have learned anything over the years of watching football, it's that friendlies mean nothing. But even if this points towards something bigger than a mild attitude problem, I'd still think an assist like that per 10-15 minutes of game time is a pretty solid return for someone who is supposedly not trying. 

The boy can't live without football. Whilst I would be annoyed but not overly despondent if he goes to Madrid, selling him to Arsenal is a bit like letting your rival marry your attractive model wife and you marrying three goats to replace her.

Plus, any big international, especially American, who joins MLS helps promote the league, and that's definitely a good thing.

Jose Ramon de la Morena has told of important news in the case of Bale. And it is that Tottenham has accepted this afternoon the offer of 96 million de Real Madrid for the Welshman, but for next year, not this year.

Real Madrid has told Bale of Levy's response and the player is thought to hold a press conference, presumably this Saturday, to announce that he feels deceived because Levy will not keep his word.

Last year, Bale came to an agreement with the president of Tottenham in which the latter would allow the player to leave if a legitimate offer came and Tottenham did not qualify for the Champions League. Both conditions have been met but Levy refuses to let him leave.

The player has talked this afternoon with the president of Tottenham to ask directly when he will be allowed to leave.

Yeah, I used to be too before I realised it wasn't feasible.

A machine gun specialist isn't for killing people for the most part, it's about suppression. Providing a cover fire for other infantry units. The likelihood, in an environment like Afghanistan is that he didn't even see someone long enough to get a shot in. It's a long, hard boring slog in in dry lands where old mujahedeen fighters take pot shots at you from a hill side. You glorify it more than I ever could. 

I'm not jingoist for suggesting that you don't appreciate being part of this country. If you don't like something you have the democratic means to do something about it, but you simply choose to resent it.

Levy agrees to sit down and start negotiations with Madrid. Things are going quite well and it seems we will get a fair bit of money for him as we all know. We bring in one or two more quality signings before the deal is done. This way we don't get sodomised on the price because clubs know we have money.

For whatever reason we don't get a direct replacement for Bale. Not that he can be replaced but there is nobody to really fill his role. We spend time searching for a replacement, and Levy makes Madrid sweat a bit to squeeze an extra few million out of them.

Madrid are happy because they are getting what they want, and once again Spurs have rolled over in the face of dirty tactics and underhanded bullshit from Madrid. Transfer deadline day comes and we have no replacement for Bale. This subreddit and various Spurs sites are littered with complaints about how Levy has once again left us without a key element of our team. We got a striker, but now we are missing a midfield wizard.

Levy sits in a darkened room next to a fax machine and a telephone in Londond Perez calls from a darkened room in Madrid to say the first payment is ready, and that as agreed they are going to pay an extra £5million since Spurs were unable to get a replacement in time. At the mention of the extra £5million Levy knows is done and allows himself a wry smile, he has Levy'd Real Madrid. He finishes the conversation and sends the fax through to real Madrid.

Perez and Zidane sit sweating as the form comes out of the fax machine, Zidane snatches the paper from the machine almost tearing it. He holds it up to the light, tears forming in his eyes. Perez looks at him and whispers ""We've done it, we got our man."" Zidane pushes him away and turns the fax around. Perez's eyes widen in horror, staring back at him is a picture of Levy smiling. Below the picture the text reads ""DON'T FUCK WITH ME PEREZ, I CONTROL THE TRANSFERS, I CONTROL THE UNIVERSE, NOT FOR SALE AT ANY PRICE MEANS NOT FOR SALE AT ANY PRICE.

And AV/PR/whatever, nothing will ever work perfectly - but they are still *more democratic* which on principle anyone who gives a shit about life and liberty would be all for even if it comes with a few drawbacks.

(As a side note, those issues aren't very difficult to solve in a technical sense, the real problem with them is if we change to AV/PR while leaving the rest of the system in it's archaic state with a bunch of stupid rules about how hung parliaments work, which is unfortunately where a bunch of people are too, unfortunately - in reality they might be a bit harder to change, of course, but again, we're talking about something of the utmost importance to the entire country, here, you'd hope there would be the will to sort that out - if there wasn't so much vested interest in the status quo).

true,Tony49UK,null,null,"It may just be as easy as changing your Domain Name Server (DNS) away from your ISP and using another one like Comodo, AVG, Google and OpenDns.  Essentially all web sites have an IP address eg. Reddit.com is 161.58.104.2.  When you type Reddit.com into your address bar your browser asks the DN Server what the IP address is for that web site.  It's like a phone book for the Internet.  If the ISPs block solely by not having banned sites on their servers than changing the DN server will get around it.  It's easy to change the DNS provider in either the OS for desktops, most routers (but not BT HomeHub) and jail broken/rooted  Androids.

An other alternative is to use a VPN, which creates an encrypted tunnel from your computer to an other computer.  For this it's preferable to have the server in another country e.g. Holland, France, Sweden etc. It's widely used by banking employees and other sectors where security is important, who have to log in to their work computers whilst on the road or at home.  Another use is by people who use P2P software as it can get around ISP throttling (where they restrict torrent speeds) and also means that the users IP address is different from the home address, so they can't be prosecuted.  As you're using different jurisdictions and the better overseas providers don't log who used what IP address and port people are using.

true,CapnJager,,Rum and coke. No ice.,"My mum's worked in a mental health institution before ... She doesn't talk about it much.  
She also worked in nursing homes for years - specifically homes that housed residents with mental health problems. I spent my summers in these homes when I was younger and couldn't be left in the house alone - my mum would just take me to work with her.  
Apparently I was a bit of help ... the nursing homes were pretty much used as a place to offload elderly relatives and having a bright, innocent child wandering around lifted their spirits. I'd chat with them, help at mealtimes, wheel the ladies to the hairdresser once a week, attempt to play the piano and play dominoes and card games with them.  
  
I rarely saw family visits and when I did they were usually because of a birthday. The visits were horribly brief ... 20 minutes at the most.  
  
Sorry for going off on a tangent...  
  
I think that psychiatric/forensic nurse and police officer are going to bring various types of heartbreak. Being a police officer will mean dealing with any trauma/stress on the scene (I've dealt with wonderful officers ... *trying to find a relevant comment I made a while ago ...* [Relevant comment!](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/uujxs/enough_stories_about_bad_cops_not_all_cops_are/c4ytx6i)) and I assume psychiatric/forensic will involve dealing with the aftermath.

The funniest thing was when this guy tells me that all Americans are terribly racist. Then, within minutes, he explained to me that ""Pakis"" are the worst people in the world. He was completely oblivious to the irony and hypocrisy he just demonstrated.

But he does not have capacity when it comes to making decisions about contraception and cannot be relied upon to use condoms or other birth control methods effectively to prevent pregnancy.""

His mental disability is good enough to decide whether he consents to sex.

But his decision making is so badly impaired with regard to decisions about contraception and birth control that he isn't considered autonomous over such decisions and as such, those decisions have to be considered by the court for him because he cannot make those decisions himself. 

Because the court is making the decision for him, it has to be sure that he wants it (which remember isn't necessarily clear with severe mental disability), and that such a decision is supported by experts and his parents.

It's not about forcing him, it's only ""forcing"" him because he technically isn't making the decision himself, even though the decision largely rests on indisputable evidence that this is what he wants. Forcing is just a sensationalised term to use to describe that. 

Therefore he wants it, and there is a case for the Court to decide as they have to see evidence that he definitely wants it, that it is safe and medically suitable for him to undergo such a procedure and that those close to him support such a decision.

The biggest failure would be if he leaves at the end of the window for less than we could have gotten otherwise.

We don't need a direct replacement for Suarez as he was effectively replaced already (as a central striker anyway) by Sturridge.  So, instead I think we need a good inside left forward and inside right forward.  Arguably the right side is covered by Aspas (a very clever signing I think) who is backed up by Downing.  Now we need a left side attacker which could be Costa or, if I had my druthers, Konopylanka.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; You give your democracy away when you join the EU.

Hah. It's true that one gives away *sovereignty*, but I would argue that we *gain* democratically by being in the EU.

I'm not saying that the EU is a bastion of democracy - everybody knows that there's a democratic deficit - but the state of our domestic democracy is truly awful as well.

Let's compare the two systems:

|Area|UK|EU|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Lower chamber|Elected by First Past the Post, has safe seats|Elected by Proportional Representation|
|Upper chamber|Life-long political appointment; Some members have a seat by birthright; largest chamber outside of China|Composed of ministers from elected governments|
|Executive|Appointed by monarch|Elected by lower chamber|
|Civil service|[Sir Humphrey Appleby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphrey_Appleby)|Unelected Eurocrats|
|Competencies|May legislate on *anything* at *any time*|Scope limited by treaty|
|Constitutional/treaty amendment|Act of Parliament|Unanimous decision by all 28 member states|

There is a need for international cooperation on many issues. Trade, policing, communications, society and culture are heavily and increasingly cross-border. Globalisation, as over-stated as it sometimes is, continues to grow.

The two best options to address these issues, it seems to me, are as follows:

* As part of the EU. As a supranational entity with a common body of law and common institutions, the EU makes incremental and lock-step changes easier to develop and implement. It also allows for changes in different areas to work together better, reducing conflict of laws. There is also democratic oversight at a supranational level in the form of the European Parliament which allows significant civil society involvement.

* Using ad-hoc treaties and conventions. Each issue is dealt with by a single treaty, probably with different nation states for each issue. There is no guarantee that states will fulfil the obligations of the treaties fully unless there are ad-hoc or semi-permenant bodies set up to oversee treaty implementation (e.g. the WTO or the proposed ACTA body). Negotiations would happen behind closed doors, with no involvement by civil society and would be presented to national legislatures as a fait acompli.

The latter option is often used to circumvent national legislative oversight. It allows for [forum-shopping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forum_shopping) and [policy laundering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy_laundering).

true,rydleo,null,null,"Who said they would need to be as good as Suarez?  Suarez, individually, is a top, top footballer.  In the context of a team, however, he's just one of 11 people on the pitch and his individual ability is much less relevant to how he fits into the team and, in general, he's not really a team player.  Again I have to ask, if Suarez is so awesome, why are we in 7th place this year and 8th the year before?  If he was the '3rd best footballer in the world' as I've heard some say, why aren't teams beating down our door to get him even at £55M when it's pretty clear we'll let him go for that?  Hell, Real are willing to pay apparently £85M for Bale but won't bid £30M less for the 3rd best footballer in the world?  The only conclusion there for any sane person is Real (who have a lot of pretty smart people on staff who know their footie) don't think Suarez is worth what Bale is.  Perhaps that should tell you something.    

Arsenal led the league in possession last season and it's a cornerstone of what they do.  Suarez had the 2nd most turnover of anyone in the league, averaging 2.4 per game.  Suarez took almost as many shots on average as Cazorla and Giroud combined.  Simply put, he really doesn't fit into their style of play at all and frankly I don't know why they want him.  He's got a good OVR or whatever on FIFA.  Who cares?  He doesn't really fit our team very well to be honest nor will he really fit the way Arsenal play either.  Do you really think they couldn't find another decent striker who could score 20+ goals after taking over 200 shots?  Frankly any striker that doesn't score at least 20 after taking as many shots as Suarez did is anything but decent.

As for we can still improve- not sure if you're aware of this, but the club is pretty well broke and has been for years.

I think a similar post or wiki page on here would be good to point new fans towards.

Basically the thought of ""Oh great, more American fans"" is something that shouldn't be had. Having a bigger community and family of fans is such a blessing. If I could have thousands of people wanting to talk about the Earthquakes, I'd be ecstatic. Band wagoners come and go, but don't doubt how much a new fan can love the club. I may not be a true Yid like other people here, but I do support with all my heart as much as I can. You can't see that as a bad thing for the club and its fanbase. 

So basically we need people here to be friendly and a helping hand and not looking down on new fans no matter where they are from and why they started following the club. Look at me, I started following because of watching some CL, the Quakes becoming partners with Spurs and people could be like ""You aren't from England, what makes you a true fan"" etc. But I learned about the history of the club and I fell in love.

Also, here he is saying exactly what I'm saying in his routine:

true,imperio115,null,null,"Peter Capaldi has a huge chance at being the next Doctor for these reasons:

1: He’s older and an older doctor would freshen things up a bit and moffat hasn't ruled out casting an older doctor

2: He’s been a fan since he was 10 (and they did cast a fan before a.k.a David Tennant)

3: he's been in Doctor Who before and was in Torchwood: Children of Earth. they can't cast an actor who's already been in the show you say? well anyone remember Colin Baker? he had a major role in the Arc of Infinity storyline and even shot the doctor so why not rule out the chance. sure he was in Torchwood but it doesn't really seem to belong to the Who universe anymore especially after what happened concerning miracle day and children of earth. 

4: He's a great actor. He's won an Oscar and a BAFTA in comedy. also he's great as Malcom Tucker and certainly has the range to play the Doctor just watch him in The Hour.

5: Betting for him has stopped completely with the odds in his Favor.

Granted he is filming The Fifth Estate right now and Malficient sometime in 2014, and is gonna star in the BBC 2014 production of The Three Musketeers (but we don't know the length of the series or air date) but if David Tennant could make movies while he was the Doctor certainly so can someone like Peter Capaldi or Chris O'Dowd or any other actor who's name is up for nomination who is a realistic choice.

Most importantly take any of these names rumored with a grain of salt as before Matt Smith was announced as the Doctor another actor was heavily implied to be the next doctor and had huge odds in his favor so keep an open mind Whovians. also even if he isn't the next doctor come Sunday i'm still gonna watch his stuff

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"The seventh Doctor is my favorite. I told myself when I started watching classic many months ago that I wouldn't pick a favorite. I wanted to love all the Doctors. And I do. But the seventh has stolen my heart.

He's got a dry humor with a dark Time Lord power underneath, and of course, a kickass companion: Ace. Their relationship is so unique, it's a tag-team ""you do the talking, I do the walking"" with 7 as a sort of stand-in parent/guide and tutor. Yet at the same time, it's almost, if you want to put on the goggles, romantic. But because of the tutor/guide thing and 7's distant otherness, it's very platonic.

And by dark Time Lord power I mean that during the seventh Doctor's era you got the feeling that while the seventh seems like a goofy dusty professor on the outside, sometimes you can tell there's an undercurrent of something. This something is alien, it's terrifying, and it's dangerous.

But it's different from the godlike awe I get from the tenth Doctor. This is where it gets hard to explain. The tenth Doctor's godlike-ness, in my opinion, relates to his vanity. Both are very unique to the tenth Doctor (unlike the shallow narcissism of the sixth or fourth).

But the tenth Doctor makes you think that he is some kind of tragic and lonely god high above us who lives in another plane. The seventh Doctor feels more like a pervasive sense of otherness. Dark otherness. (That and it's been pointed out to me that while Tennant is a fantastic actor, he can't do ""eccentric"" to save his life despite being a master at barely-concealed-anger. McCoy has the opposite acting strength/weakness.)

Btw, this dark sense of otherness is very strong in the novel Lungbarrow. Funnily enough, he is revealed to be the Other in the novel and his cousins in the House of Prydon often wonder what the Doctor is. He's Time's Champion for one thing...
What's interesting is that I say these things about the seventh Doctor but I don't know how I reached this feeling. Probably because of the story Remembrance of the Daleks. It was my first seventh Doctor story. I think. I don't know why, but there's something compelling about his personality. It's a blend of dignity and humility, comedy and darkness.

In retrospect he's also an amazing Doctor (and I'm more sure he's my favorite now) because of his excellent run on Big Finish Productions' audio drama range. McCoy's stories have made me cry. Yup. And break my heart. And just recently I listened to what is, imo, the best radio drama* I've heard yet out of 200+ and it's with SEVEN.

*Despite the term ""radio drama"" it's primarily just for purchased on www.bigfinish.com (though it has been on radio).

true,frothewin,null,null,"&gt;Your admission that you won't use it in public is an admission that it is an inherently offensive term

No, it's an admission that other people would find it offensive. I obviously don't think it's offensive or else I wouldn't use it.

&gt;it makes you cowardly to use the term in a way that you can escape the consequences.

In the same way that it's cowardly to change your word choice at work or around family.

&gt;You call a person a pussy and that's offensive. Your intent is to hurt.

So I take it you don't use ""pussy"", ""cunt"", or ""bugger""?

&gt;offending millions of people who have spent their lives fighting people who use that word to dehumanize them

Evidently not because a black person has never confronted me on it. It has the potential to offend, yes. But I've never actually used it to offend.

&gt;There is a difference between trying to offend the speaker, which calling them a dick might do, and then in one fell swoop offending millions of other of people.

Again, calling someone a cunt or a pussy is derogatory to half the population.

&gt;Just because a black man isn't there to hear you doesn't make it any less offensive.

We must have a different definition of the word offensive because I disagree with this on a fundamental level. It can't be offensive if no one is around to be offended. It's *potentially* offensive, but using it in correct company isn't offensive.

true,reddituser354,null,null,"While I agree with most of your points, your WW2 points are incorrect.

&gt;It's really stupid when people say the US didn't show up until the last minute in WWII.

I agree with this, because the US joined halfway through WW2 (late 1941) rather than towards the end. I would also like to point out that the US didn't voluntarily join WW2; Germany and Italy declared war in response to the US declaring war on Japan.

&gt;The allies would have lost if the US didn't do anything.  

I'll agree the allies wouldn't have won so easily, but the UK held its own against a German invasion thanks to a superior Air Force and Navy. Even ignoring this, Most of the war was fought in russia [the majority of the German casualties were against Russia, not the west.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_casualties_in_World_War_II).

&gt;The US did the most in N. Africa

The US joined slightly after half way through the North African campaign, and while they helped, [in no way did 'the most'.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_African_Campaign)

&gt;the Med

This doesn't really make any sense; the 3 key land points in the med(Gibraltar, Malta and the Suez canal), were all British owned. [Wikipedia suggests that the USA only played a supportive role](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Mediterranean).

&gt;Italy

The amount of fighting the US did in the Italian campaign is not as significant as you suggest, the US and UK were fairly equal.  


&gt;while simultaneously fighting Japan on the other side of the world will very little help.

The Pacific campaign began for both the US and Commonwealth forces in December 1941, with the invasion of Hong Kong and the Pearl Harbour raid. Other than bases on Guam and Wake Island, this was the only attack on US territory in the Pacific campaign.  
The Commonwealth however had to deal with [The Burma campaign] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma_Campaign) within a few weeks, as well as various other battles(Malaya for example).  
However, even if we were to ignore the efforts of the British commonwealth, your statement is ignorant of the million dead Chinese soldiers who died fighting [80% of the Japanese military](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War#Japanese_forces).
In fact, the Chinese military force of 5 million actually means they 'did the most'  in the pacific campaign.

So while I agree the US did much of the fighting in WW2, they bloody well didn't do it single handedly as you imply.",0,1375508306,null,0,false,0,cbg0rgu,t3_1jkhln,t1_cbg0rgu,t1_cbfupgc,null,1429961597,33,false,INGLIN,t5_2v1ve,33

&gt;They're going to instinctively downvote it to try and make the facts go away. Just watch.
Brits are motivated by their inherent need to belittle the US and rewrite history to depict the US in an unrealistically negative way. Because Brits see any slight made against the US, no matter how blatantly false and hypocritical, as an immediate boost to their own pride, because pretty much their entire identity is based around comparing themselves to the US.**Comes with the territory of being our lapdog, I guess.**

yeah but im sure they've lost demographics like this before during the old years and it likely didn't hurt them as much. for example look at Sherlock, i mean Sherlock and John watson have always been portrayed as older men but now they are portrayed by younger actors aka Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman. hell even Moriarty is suppose to be an old professor but he's been portrayed by Andrew Scott who is like in his 30's.  

It's all about choice, accepting change, and going on faith really when you make a decision like this. sure some people may leave the show if the doctor is old, sure it will alienate some of the younger viewers, sure it will make people mad, but when its someone like john hurt or even possibly peter capaldi; who are really great actors, you just don't pass up on a opportunity like that you gotta take that leap of faith and hope people will love the actor and the decision regardless of what happens. 

you as a viewer have two options accept and move on, or protest and rage quit the show. while its never an easy thing to accept change in due time most people will accept it. just look at matt smith and how sooooo many people were like ""WHO THE FUCK IS THIS GUY HE'S TO YOUNG TO BE THE DOCTOR"" and know people love his portrayal of the doctor and dont want him to leave.

But it wasn't done in a dickish way. It was a learning experience.

Now if someone doesn't agree they'll just downvote with no counterpoint argument or try and make a point of personally insulting you for that lack of knowledge. Then everyone else ( usually ) upvotes that dickish reply like it's some sort of one-upmanship competition that someone has to win. It's like a playground argument. 

I mean not everyone knows what you know on a subject or shares the same opinion and vice versa, so I don't see why you should disrespect someone for not having that knowledge or a differing opinion. 

Can you imagine if a school or uni worked like that, you give your opinion and if it's wrong or slightly obtuse then everyone turns against you till you walk out of the classroom never wanting to add to the discussion again. Some learning experience there. 

Personally it just stops me saying what I want to say here and I comment less and less.

true,Sgt_General,,Do it for Redders 4: Never Stop Doing it!,"Steve Morison is a player who really winds me up. Here is a man with a proven record of scoring goals in the Championship during past seasons, yet he for us he was workshy and uninterested. I can't remember the last time I saw a player with a proven record of effectiveness do so little for the club on the pitch. He just clearly wasn't bothered. I know that he had injury problems last season, but there is no way a player can be deemed fit enough to start or come off the bench and be justified in never challenging for the ball or breaking into a sprint.

Another thing that winds me up is that I've seen quotes from Morison and sources close to him about how important first team football is to him - as if he wasn't getting that at Leeds! He played in every game he was passed fit for, with the exception of the game or two when McDermott decided to take him out of the firing line. Simply put, if McDermott could have conceivably found a way for Morison to have excelled and fired in the goals, he certainly would have kept him and continued paying the lad 17k a week. But Brian must have known that Morison wasn't going to do the business.

I can understand Morison being frustrated at being ousted on the first day of pre-season training, but there must have been a reason. Maybe Brian wanted to take a look at him and was unimpressed by his lack of fitness - it stands to reason that any player incapable of keeping up the fitness regime he talked so much about would be on their way. Or perhaps he saw straight away that Morison's careless attitude was still prevalent. On the bright side, at least he's a player who actively sought a transfer (albeit only on a loan basis for now) out of the club, instead of sitting on his big contract to spite us.

The only reason I can see is so they can say ""look how forward thinking we are! We made the Doctor a woman! Girl power yeah! 

I'm not sexist. Don't paint me at way, and if I get down voted so be it. I just think it'd be gimmicky to change.

I *sort of* feel like that about a black doctor but not as strongly. 

The doctor was born a male. The established canon of the show has never **shown** a time*lord* become a time*lady* that's why there were time ladies in the first place! 

There was one line in one episode, it'd be wrong to change 50years of established history over that.

Bring the Timelords back sure, bring Romana back and have her travel with the Doctor again yeah! 

But the Doctor should remain male.

Arsenal can win titles with Suarez. We had the second best defense and third most goals scored last year, and that was when everything was against us (key players like Cazorla, Podolski and Giroud hadn't acclimatised to the PL, Ramsey, Wilshere and Diaby were huge question marks etc.), and without a world class striker.

Your article, my emphasis 

       Reports emerged YESTERDAY that the UK might have 
       around 1,000 trillion cubic feet of OFFSHORE shale gas, 
       a figure  the Times and Wall Street Journal are attributing 
       to the British Geological Survey (BGS). But when we asked 
       BGS, it told us it doesn't recognise the estimate, 

Your article relates to a potential **OFFSHORE** discovery which was reported 'prematurely'.     
It is dated **19th April, 2012**.

The article I cited:   

        The British Geological Survey TODAY estimates that 
        the amount of shale gas trapped in the North (the 
        so-called Bowland shale basin) is 1,330 trillion cubic 
        feet. This would be the biggest figure in the world...
       
And if you don't know where the Bowland basin lies, or haven't been following the news, there's an additional link to the BGS which says:   

          The British Geological Survey (BGS) in association 
          with DECC has completed an estimate for the resource 
          (gas-in-place) of shale gas in part of central Britain in 
          an area between Wrexham and Blackpool in the west, 
          and Nottingham and Scarborough in the east. The 
          estimate is in the form of a range to reflect geological
          uncertainty. The lower limit of the range is 822 tcf* 
          and the upper limit is 2281 tcf, but the central estimate 
          for the resource is 1329 tcf.         

Between Wrexham and Blackpool, Nottingham and Scarborough.  It  relates to an *ONSHORE discovery*.  There's even [an image of the 64 investigative bore wells they dug.](http://www.bgs.ac.uk/research/energy/shaleGas/images/presentation/wellData.jpg)  All onshore.

This is an **ONSHORE** discovery, in addition to your post, and the British Geographical Study has confirmed and released their study for download.  It is dated **27th June, 2013**, the same date the Ukgov hosts have for the release.

Different discoveries.

Ballpark estimate with margins of error?         
1.3 *Quadrillion* cubic feet of *ONSHORE* shale gas!

&gt;One thing that irritates me as an Arsenal fan is the fact that he 'might consider' a transfer request.

It irritates me as a Liverpool fan too. Handing in a transfer request ought to be the beginning of a transfer saga, not the nuclear option after weeks of bullshit. It was the same with Xabi Alonso, whose reluctance to hand in the request made things more protracted than necessary and in my opinion was a major factor in the fact that he wasn't properly replaced.

Also, the voting system is almost inevitably in a gridlock, meaning that no matter how much you associate with a 3rd party, the chances of this party making it into congress are so low that you might as well not go vote in the first place, because you have to achieve a majority in a state, which is darn near impossible.

About the wages, you can't JUST take average wages into account because considering most of entrepreneurs come from the US, and considering how vast the income discrepancy is in the US, the average will always be high in a capitalist nation. You have to factor in things such as the median income showing you how much a middle class person in the US earns, deviation to see how filthy rich the 0.1% of the top earners in the US are and how filthy poor the bottom 10% are. You have to  take into account the work conditions and things of that sort to see that America isn't as well off as you might claim it to be.

As for your 'why did we finish where we dod it suarez is so good' let me ask you this, where would we have finished without his goals? One player can't do it all.

You cannot say that with any certainty. I think it's possible that it might actually be good for Spurs to lose Bale.

We may end up with a more balanced team without Bale. We certainly will have plenty money to invest in quality players.

It's worth adding that he cannot stay now anyway. It's gone too far. It's like Berbatov and Modric all over again. The player's head has been turned. He's refusing to play.

[The line-up](http://i.imgur.com/aXqvWk8.jpg)

Now, down to some stats. Here are some interesting facts from the results:

* More people chose **Hazard** than **Mata**

* /r/chelseafc loves **Rami**. He was nearly half of people's choice for DM, a position that proved difficult to choose

* **Ivanovic** fails to make the starting XI (EDIT: It seems that this has happened as those that didn't put him at right back, put him at centre back. He picked up a lot of votes in both categories but not enough to get him in the starting line-up in either. I think he would probably be in 60-70% of people's starting line up either at RB or CB)

* More people would rather see **Blackman** start over **Schwarzer** (granted these are small numbers and anyone who picked anything other than Cech ~~should~~ ought not be taken seriously)

* Over 15% of people believe **David Luiz**'s best position is in DM

* **Ba** is no longer a first-team choice

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Based on the results I have compiled a 7-man bench that provides a spread of positions rather than the 7 most-voted players outside the starting XI:

**Blackman - Ivanovic - Essien - van Ginkel - De Bruyne - Schürrle - Torres**

Ferry or shuttle. No problem.

This is part of the problem surrounding the whole EU debate.

Somebody has said something, right or wrong, agree or disagree, and somebody else seemingly has opened an unconnected text file on their computer, copied the contents, pasted it, and the discussion hasn't moved on.  And in the ciiiiircle of Terry Gilliam's Brazil someone else then recopies and posts it, but nobody is reading any more and the actual issue isn't addressed.

The submission in this case made a very clear attempt to address how much was coming back, it was even a crux beyond the headline.

Discussing something is supposed to be about establishing the reality to the situation, the nature of the problem, and possible explanations.  That's never going to happen if someone just copies and pastes a prefabricated argument that doesn't address the issue.  

That, or they've written a response without getting past the headline.  One that ignores that everything they claim the UK receives could still be had and for much less outside the EU - without losing access to the single market.

You could Fisk that comment with a red pen and take everything out as being either (a) not relevant considering the article, or (b) not dependent on being in the EU.

----------------------

The real issue is if the budget keeps going up, but for every £1 that comes back £5 has to go in, and if the rebate is getting ever smaller with every country's ascension due to how it is worked out, and where 5/6ths of the entire spend is spent on either the protectionist CAP or the  woefully inefficient Cohesion Fund, then even before it becomes an anti-EU issue, or even if you're incredibly pro-EU, the issue is how to plug the holes because it is becoming LESS efficient whatever your wishes for the EU might be.   

This is the issue:

- Half the budget is being spent on CAP but food prices are still GOING UP and more people are still struggling with their weekly food shop.   

- A third of the budget is spent on Cohesion and Development yet more schisms and fractures are appearing, especially in Med states.   So LESS cohesion.

- Member states are whipping themselves into AUSTERITY, yet at the same time the EU BUDGET is INCREASING.   

The response you copied was to say look at the £1 we do get back for every 5 we put in, and look at the 1/6th of the total spend that isn't being squandered (although I could go into that too).   

What the article points out is that spend is going significantly up, at a time when key EU areas of policy are producing less.  Can we address that please.",0,1375528531,null,0,1375548296,0,cbg3usf,t3_1jl6ij,t1_cbg3usf,t1_cbft7z9,null,1429960154,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Check to see if your lights are working, if they are check to see if the engine will crank. If it doesn't, jump start/bump start it and see if it will maintain idle without dying - leave it idling to try and charge the battery and try and start it again. If it starts then the charging system is fine, if not then it's only one of three things (battery, regulator rectifier, alternator).

We don't yet know how the block will be implemented, porn and P2P have been two of the biggest driving forces behind faster broadband speed uptake.  OFCOM says that ""Super fast"" 40Mb+ broadband is only usually wanted in families with multiple teenage children.  Removing porn and P2P is likely to decimate demand for fast internet.  Therefore whilst ISPs will see a reduction in bandwidth after the porn ban.  It is also likely to see a reduction in demand for FTTC/FTTP.  The ban whilst called a ""porn ban"" also hits a load of other areas such as P2P, gambling, social networks, ""esoteric sites"" whatever they may be as well as suicide and ""getting around the block"" sites.

It's probably therefore not in ISPs best interests to really hit down hard on ""banned"" sites but to have a block in place that satisfies the Government but still allows people to get around it.  Just how many phone calls do they want from lets say husbands saying ""I want to watch porn but I don't want my wife to know that I've broken the porn block"".  Can you imagine just how many irate customers and ""funny"" phone calls there might be?
And this is all being done as implement this or we'll regulate/ pass laws etc,  If the ISPs show some level of co-operation they may well escape the legislation.

I got a place through a site called GapBuster (http://gapbuster.com/ - but their site's changed, not sure if they still do it). I had to do a stupidly easy online test to register, then could choose assignments.

Assignments were things like 'Go to PC World and pretend you're a student buying a new computer for university work and games' or 'Go to Pizza Hut and order a two course meal and drinks'.

During the assignment, you had to keep track of various things, depending on where you were (how clean is the establishment, how knowledgeable are the staff, how long between each course), etc. Afterwards, you had to write up an evaluation form and email it back.

The pay was pretty low, but you'd get free stuff (the more free stuff, the less pay). When I did the PC World job I had to buy something worth £5 or more, and I got £5 back. I also got £8 and transport paid. The Pizza Hut job I didn't get paid, but I got £25 of the meal paid (it came to £26 because I took somebody with me).

It's not a solid job by any means, but it's quite nice for a source of extra income and it can be fun.

So we should spend billions creating separate terminals and enforce aircraft from within the EU to only use those terminals? I don't actually see how this logistically how this would work (for example at busy periods), or who would foot the bill. You'd also have to replicate the border and customs staff, it would just be a logistical nightmare.

When you actually think it through, what we have right now is perfectly adequate. The problem with allowing people to simply come from mainland Europe unchecked is that the rest of mainland Europe doesn't enforce it's borders properly, for example France doesn't stop illegal immigrants coming to the UK, and infact actively encourages it.

true,milikom,eng-durham,Durham,"It's not the government doing the drilling.  If the drilling is too expensive, the companies simply won't do it.

Edit: Reading my comment back, I think I phrased it such that everyone will get the wrong end of the stick.  I know that there is a minimum price - my point was meant to read that the government should be encouraging drilling.  I can't help but completely disagree with Mantonization, as he's made it seem like the government is disregarding everything bad about fracking to somehow make money off of it.

&gt; If that's the case, then once again this is a Tory government concerned more with following ideology than following facts.

In fact, I think that if you examine the facts surrounding fracking it makes sense to incentivise companies to go ahead with it.

Although the scientific consensus is moving towards recognising that fracking does cause minor tremors, they are so minor that only 3 have every been felt on the surface worldwide.  The misrepresentation that anyone who lives near a fracking site risks losing their home in a pile of smoke is nonsense and I feel is responsible for the marge amount of stick that this new technology gets.

The other main opposition to shale gas is the possibility that it might somehow infect the groundwater.  But a study conducted by the British Geological Survey concluded that ""... where the problems are genuinely attributable to shale gas operations, the problem is with poor well design and construction, rather than anything distinctive to shale gas.""  I would argue, therefore, that it makes sense to invest in this technology that it might become even safer while retaining the same benefits.

Following the facts, it appears that fracking is no more dangerous to the public than drilling for oil or setting up wind farms.

&gt; It's not about doing what's best for the country.

In the face of rising prices for oil and gas from overseas and depleting stocks I think that it is prudent for government to encourage this new technology that we might become more energy independent and better utilise our natural resources.  The huge amount of energy that could be gained from such an endeavor would be of huge benefit to this country, vastly outweighing the inflated risks.

&gt; It's about showing up those damn environmentalist liberals, and making money while you're doing it.

I would like to point out that earlier this year the government threw a massive bone to environmentalists by way of wind power companies by *doubling* the minimum price for electricity produced by wind power.  But of course all anyone can remember of the Tories approach to green energy is the 25% cut to the £1billion subsidies given to the companies that set up the turbines.  If anything about the Tories' ideology could be said here it's that they would rather pay for the actual electricity produced rather than the turbines which are not a guaranteed source of power in and of themselves which just seems logical.  Either way, there has been a net increase in the grant to wind power (assuming that the turbines will turn a profit for the companies running them.)",0,1375532419,null,0,1375538350,0,cbg4bjv,t3_1jmcqc,t1_cbg4bjv,t1_cbg3pr4,null,1429959937,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9
