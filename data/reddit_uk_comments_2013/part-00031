&gt;Why are people on pensions more vulnerable in times of austerity, if their pensions are unaffected?

The increase in living costs experienced by pensioners [tends to be higher than the national rate](http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/pensions/article-2062107/Pensioners-suffer-worst-inflation-cost-living-soars-20-years.html), so their incomes are being stretched further and further as time goes on, even if they rise in line with CPI, which I believe is the current highest figure in the triple-lock.  This is a fall in their real income, which makes them more vulnerable.

&gt;That is factually wrong, welfare spending has doubled as a percentage of GDP since 1961, with most of the extra money going on pensions:

Fair point - you're right that welfare/pensions spending as a proportion of GDP has doubled in the past 50 years.  I think the website I linked to treats welfare and pensions as separate categories, and adding them together does indeed double the proportion of GDP, in line with the reports that were linked in that Lib Dem Conference article.

But I stand by the comment that overall spending as a proportion of GDP has not changed drastically in that time.  Indeed, between 1950 and 1975 it was actually rising, averaging out to about 40% of GDP, while we managed to pay down debt worth around 150% of GDP.

40% of GDP is also a fairly typical figure for government spending nowadays, so I also stand by my main argument; it is absolutely clear that paying down the current debt level (around 70%) does not require special austerity measures.  In addition, applying austerity to welfare could be actively detrimental to the most vulnerable people in society.",0,1360959095,null,0,1360959424,0,c8ftxe2,t3_18kos3,t1_c8ftxe2,t1_c8fomlx,null,1431304661,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Unfortunately that wasn't the vector of attack from this article. 

It seems Mr. Horrible histories is upset at the fact people share good things they absorb, good knowledge. He's pissed off that libraries are - in his twisted mind - an obstruction to some sort of literary cash cow hollywood.

I hope he actually fucking goes to a library, pays attention to all the effort librarians put into schemes to help kid's read, lend them books that their guardians sure as fuck wouldn't have BOUGHT them, and provide an environment where people can get into reading, or enjoy reading at whatever age.

Yes, we're old and musty, YES I do realise that most texts are more easily available online than in a library.

But you have acted illogically! You've not responded logically to what I've said:
&gt;&gt;Correct me if I'm wrong; but AFAIK homosexuals aren't allowed to play music or have religious scripts read during a ceremony for a civil partnership, and religious institutions are not legally permitted to perform civil partnerships. Those are all things that are allowed for hetrosexual marriages. It's clearly discrimination.

&gt;I'm saying I don't see anything illogical or inconsistent in my view; it is just a view different to yours. [...] They could have a ceremony or blessing in any church that would allow them too; with music and reading or whatever they wanted.

No they can't honestchristian! They fucking can't! It's not that you and I have ""different views"", it's a fucking fact that gay people aren't allowed to *""have a ceremony or blessing in any church that would allow them too; with music and reading or whatever they wanted""*.  
It  is not logical to respond to my argument by just saying things that aren't true.  
Look it up:  
&gt;[It is prohibited for civil partnerships to include religious readings, music or symbols.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_partnership_in_the_United_Kingdom)

On wikipedia or another reliable website.
&gt;[The difference exists principally due to protests from religious groups about recognising same-sex couples and heterosexual couples in the same way. In fact, religious institutions are not legally permitted to perform civil partnerships.  
[...]  
On 5 February 2013, the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill 2012-2013 was debated in the House of Commons and was approved by 400 to 175 votes. The Bill, if turned into an Act, will allow same-sex couples to marry in the same way as opposite-sex couples can.

If you don't mind I'd also quite like to know what *logical and consistant* thought process lead you to typing this out:  
&gt;You seem to be dangerously close to wanting to force churches who don't recognise gay marriage as marriage to have to perform them.

What about what I've said has lead you to believe that I want that to happen? Could you please tell me what wording I used that *seems to be dangerously close* to supporting discrimination against churches? The sentance of mine that you quoted hardly indicate such a view, and I don't think any of my unquoted sentances do either. For what it's worth, I *don't* support such an absurd law, I'd oppose one if it was proposed, and no such bill *has* been proposed! It's a myth that the uninformed homophobic religous groups are spreading:

It's stuff like that, that makes me think you're a troll. You've not really responded to what I've said - you've just repeated your own opinion and not attempted to back it up or discredit my own.

&gt;perhaps you didn't catch the word 'outrage'. I agree it was disrespectful, I do not agree it warrants such an overblown response.

Well I suppose that *is* opinion and it is where you and I differ on this subject. I think it's extremely distasteful and I think this moment would not be inappropriate to vent some outrage at all the outrageous stunts the Sun has pulled over the years.

&gt;The Sun is just doing what it has always done, and it is ridiculous in my view to be particularly alarmed to discover that they would use a picture of an attractive woman to sell a newspaper. 

In which case just downvote and move on - that's what you do if you think a topic is not relevant to the subreddit. I still don't quite believe that you're not defending the Sun though - you say you're not defending them, you're just trying to convince people not to attack them . . . 

&gt;The great irony of this whole thing is that the Sun knew all too well what they were doing, and likely anticipated the backlash would become a story in itself. They orchestrated the whole thing, and have kept 'the Sun' brand in the spotlight across the national media for a few days, playing everyone like puppets. All this outrage simply ups their profile further.

That is something we can agree on then. I don't think that means it's pointless trying to get the Sun to clean up it;s act though.

true,TheEvilScotsman,scottish,Scotland,"Terry Deary seems rather questionable at times.

I've seen him have a go at History as a university study, and his reasoning was very limited. He had a go at historians for limitation, which all historians worth their salt will admit to, and said that it was a way in which they pick and choose facts for their argument. While this is true, this is also what makes it useful as a subject. Historians analyse  the available information, to the best of their ability, and pick out what appears to them to be the most essential information. This of course leads to different interpretations, but they are valid as long as they can be defended with facts. From this we can work out long-term causation and use it to try and work out how we got to wear we are and how we can progress. His argument boils down to the belief that there can be such a thing as objective history, but this belief is ungrounded in fact.

I could argue differently, but this is the most sincere argument I can make in the limited time I currently have (rather like how a historian may argue a certain case given their limitations). 

Now his comment about libraries is similarly from a place of ignorance. Books cost money and times are tight. The library is a welcome place where knowledge can be freely gleaned. His argument that he would be earning £180 000 in sales as opposed to £6000 is compelling, but again not grounded in fact, as it assumes that the desire to read a book and the desire to own a book are the same thing. All that would result is that fewer people would read his books, and all books. He would rob the British people of the ability to read widely.

Thank you! :)

Edit: Okay, I'm hijacking my own comment since this one is at the top. 

You guys. Seriously. I can't say thank you enough. All of your comments have really motivated me to get the dress finished. I solved the fit problem tonight and picked up the netting to puff out the skirt, so if I focus this weekend I think I can get it done with the exception of the rhinestones. Those take forever. 

I was seriously frustrated with this dress but the response to this has kicked me back into gear. I am beyond thankful. 

I will post pictures of it again before FanExpo, once it's finished. I will be wearing it in these pictures, it won't be on the dress form. 

While I may decide to sell this exact dress in the future, perhaps after FanExpo, I don't intend to produce any more and sell them. I'm so sorry, but I just don't think I could do it. I've tried turning my hobbies into a source of income before and it's failed miserably, so this is one thing that I'd like to keep and enjoy forever. :) I'm also very fussy and given how often I make my friends come for fittings when I'm sewing things for them, it would drive me mad to sew for someone that isn't here. 

Again, thank you ALL of you for your comments. This was the kick in the ass I needed to get back to work on it! 

Edit, a month later.. OP delivers!! For those of you who are coming across this later in the game, I posted an update last night.

true,weblypistol,null,null,"&gt;I'm not sure what you are trying to say here. The point behind this post is that Brooker started out as a single fellow sat in his flat recording sections for his own

It was a set.

&gt;very unknown TV show (Screenwipe) that originally aired on the obscure BBC4 channel

[Brooker was known](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TVGoHome). He's spectacularly well known now. And that is not over a short space of time. Maybe more your attention span.

BBC4 is not obscure.

I like Brooker a lot. He has done well. Doesn't mean a stupid pic that basically says the same, give me votes has real valid worth. He fits into this sub lovely, I've posted about him. Wasn't a stupid pic saying look at Brooker though. Your post is not Screenwipe. It's not Weekly wipe. It's a pictures of a set. No philosophical discussion of the series, no comedy input. It's a set being changed. We all love Charlie but your direction is one Barry Shitpeas would take as significant.

Have I explained enough or do you want to post a picture of Brooker saying "" I like him ""?

A correction. *You* embarrass the sub. Your post was a picture or two of a set. No real content. That's the point. I love Charlie but am not going to hero worship. If I wanted to do that google images would suffice. The post had no content.

Because of how that concept was aborted, and how old the concept is, I don't really see them returning to it, although anything's possible.

I've since been to one much more frequently but it's one I'd paid for at Uni, that had specialised sections for my course. Once during summer break, I went to a public library and they couldn't offer the type of books I needed for my course in the way I needed, so public library's have been useless even when I've needed them. Since leaving Uni I'm back to never needing a library. The same goes for all my family and friends - if you use a library you're in the *major* minority.

His views on money are neither here nor there for me, but I can see his point. He does raise an interesting comparison with the cinema trip, though. Why is it accepted that entertainment in book form should be 'free'? I agree with knowledge being free (and so that aspect of a library), but entertainment... not so much.

If anything (and I know library's are trying to offer this) having access to the internet is more important than access to books, and that's what needs to replace library's. Several kindles and some computers placed in a museum/art gallery can replace an entire library.

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; One person kept commenting on my speed and acceleration, constantly telling me to ""accelerate faster"" and ""get up to the speed limit"".

This is right. 

&gt; I'm an ~~extremely patient and careful~~ over-cautious driver and many times I feel I would rather drive at e.g. 30mph on a 40 road, especially as a learner. Is that illegal?

It's not illegal, but it's probably against the highway code. Certainly, when I did my test a few years ago (less than 10), my instructor told me that you will fail the test for it.

To be a good driver you should be confident and aware. You should be capable of judging speed and distance correctly. 

Most all the time, if you're driving at the speed limit, you could drive faster perfectly safely.

Our speed limits were set when cars weighed twice what they do now and had drum brakes. Modern cars have disk brakes, traction control and ABS, and are designed so that they can be driven safely at over 100mph on the autobahn.

If you can drive safely at the speed limit (which you usually can, on A-roads and dual carriageways and stuff) then driving at 15% - 25% below that seems to indicate a lack of confidence.   

Hesitancy is dangerous, not just for yourself, but for other people, too. Driving too slowly isn't hesitancy, as such, but IMO it's related.",0,1360973610,null,0,1360977072,0,c8fy73z,t3_18lr42,t1_c8fy73z,t3_18lr42,null,1431306742,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Let me show you mine. 15 goals this season, thats 1 goal less than Frank Lampard, who happens to have played 8 games less than Torres this season. Frank is great, and I hope we sign him, but our striker should be scoring more than our mid thirties year old midfielder who has 8 less games. 15 goals is also 1 less compared to Mata, another (brilliant) midfielder of ours, Mata has 42 appearences tho, one less than Torres, but Mata also has 18 assists just this season which is amazing. Together, Ivanovic and Cahill have scored 12 goals this season, hell, everyone at Chelsea seems to be scoring this season, not just Torres.

Compared to all of this, Torres' stats seems rather bleak, especially when you consider his playing time, number of appearences, and the fact that he is playing in front of players such as Hazard, Mata, Oscar, Ramires, Lampard, who happen to be world class mid fielders.

Most other teams that are contending for important competitions, teams such as Man U, Real Madrid, Barcelona, PSG, Juventus, Atletico Madrid, Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund all have a clinical strikers on form (e.g. RVP, Messi, Ronaldo, Falcao, Zlatan). Would Torres be good enough to be the main striker in either of these teams? If no, then there's not many good arguments left for why he should be our main striker either.

It was very psychedelic during [Four's run,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqqWDqZYm78) and it was also very yellowish and reddish during [Nine and](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qan9Q-mO1uI) [Ten's runs.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSQgysXVHEU)

Point 3: *Doctor Who* is a show about traveling through both space *and* time. If it were just about traveling through time, you'd get something like the *Back to the Future*, except with aliens and monsters.

Point 5: Space has been utilized before in the intros. [Five's intro](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deQN2iP1mHQ) was set in space, as was [Seven's.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nhemnHrIsg) Both space *and* the Vortex were used in [the intro from the movie.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RZ2fBX8i-A)",0,1360976790,null,0,false,0,c8fz0km,t3_18jywn,t1_c8fz0km,t1_c8fms84,null,1431307130,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"Personally I am a student and fairly financially secure currently. Decent degree headed my way and student loan takes care of the present day; so I can't say I'm under particular financial burden. 

I think some of my personal data online is protected by the EU where the UK protection runs out. The combined protection being greater than just the UK rules.

I have also personally enjoyed the ease of travel around Europe. I have noticed my mobile roaming costs coming down, and I appreciate the NHS healthcare agreements in the EU (e111 card? Not sure).

I know a few people who have left university and have been looked after by job seekers allowance whilst out of work. So my friends in worse positions than I also seem to be doing OK. 

Other than my actual friends I feel no more affinity to one human than another, so I don't resent ""British money"" being spent on someone outside the UK. Obviously I personally think waste is unpleasant and money spent on French agricultural subsidies (for example) could be put to better use. But I can't say I find these things affecting my life.

So in short: I enjoy a few more legal protections from the EU than the UK alone. I also enjoy easier safer cheaper travel. I imagine I also enjoy some imports as a product of freer trade in the EU. You're right that we would still trade with Europe but we would be less powerfully able to negotiate from outside. Our financial contribution buys us some influence. 

I apologize for any rambling. I just typed this on my phone. 

Edit. There's all sorts of other shit the EU gets up to that I support (and that I don't). Butthis is just off the top of my head that has affected me. I also think strong collaboration with our neighbours is a valuable thing, even if it costs ""us"" money. I think it boosts Europe as a whole and I consider Europe just as much ""us"" as I do the UK.  Edit2. Strong cities in the UK prop up weaker ones.

And I went atleast once a week for 10 years. Now what? I'd say my parents got value for their money, yours didn't. 

&gt;I went to a public library and they couldn't offer the type of books I needed for my course in the way I needed

Its impossible to know what to make of this other than to say (1) clearly the public library isn't going to stock a myriad of specific academic texts and (2) ""in the way I needed"" suggest that you had some specific needs that the library could not meet - not that the library could not get the book. 

&gt;Why is it accepted that entertainment in book form should be 'free'?

(1)Because as a society, we've repeatedly collectively decided this.
(2) Because a book is simply different  different to a film. Different costs, different user experience, different users. You can buy buy books from bookstore if you want to own the instance of the rights to the IP. This is a red herring argument. The point is that society choose to subsidise the library through public funds because of the value they add to society. There is nothing stopping a cinema chain from claiming the same, and lobbying for subsidies. 

&gt; I agree with knowledge being free 

Huh. What? 

&gt;but entertainment... not so much.

And where is the delineation. If I read a fiction book but learn something from it, does it stop being entertainment and start ""knowledge""? What about if I take enjoyment from an academic text?

&gt;If anything (...) having access to the internet is more important than access to books

Completely and painfully wrong. What more important is access information, inc. authoritative versions of texts, free from censorship, in a way that suits your consumption requirements. 
   
&gt;Several kindles and some computers placed in a museum/art gallery can replace an entire library. 

Its very depressing that you think this. Libraries do many things that you don't see / use / acknowledge. This doesn't make them useless, it means that your opinion is useless. Fortunately you don't have large say in funding discussions.

There's no agenda on my part and if I sounded aggressive then I'm sorry; I know you're just stating your opinion.  I just find it to be deeply misinformed.

The one difference that you're quite correct about is that children of gay parents are usually subjected to discrimination but where does the blame lie for that?  Is it with the loving gay parents or is it those with attitudes like yours?

&gt;Normal people read through this bullshit, it's actually a bad thing if you say statements like that because people wont take you seriously and begin to think 'oh look its another fake gay study, trying to make us support gays'.

My case in point.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I don't agree with your comment but I feel bad that you're getting so many downvotes and that you're being called a troll.  Also, as a gay man who, at some point, hopes to adopt, I feel I have something to say on this.  I don't really care to ""argue"" with you, but I think you may need to open your mind.

&gt;it would just all feel so surreal when I realise I'm in a different situation than everybody else.

Everyone is in a different situation from everyone else.  Should this apply to single mothers?  Single fathers?  Separated parents?  It also *especially* applies to those children who are moved to and from foster homes, who're made to live with people they don't know particularly well, they end up living with other ""siblings"" who aren't their real siblings (bearing in mind they can often be split up with their real siblings), they can be moved school etc.  I've met kids who were adopted (by opposite-sex parents), and then put back into the system after years of having lived with their adoptive parents.  **That** is likely to separete these kids from everyone else around them.

&gt;Then imagine learning about gay people bumming each other, as a child who has only just learned about what bumming is.

Alas, in gay relationships we usually just call it ""sex"", but I feel I should tell you that not all gay couples ""bum"".  However, surely you realise that anal sex can be done by heterosexual couples as well, and therefore it's entirely possible that *your* mother, at some point, took it up the bum?  Is it a pleasant thought?  No.  It's no more pleasant than the idea of your mum entering into bondage with your father, it's no more pleasant than the idea of your mother queefing on your dads face.  Teenagers manage to learn about all these sexual activities without putting much thought into whether their parents have done them.  This applies just as much to the children of same sex parents.  

**(apologies for using such disgusting images there, but it was to make a point!  I can promise you that, as a gay guy, the idea of queefing is especially difficult for me!)**

&gt;Or watching TV as a kid seeing a man and a woman together you'd think 'is that what I want or do I want to meet another dad for my child', those thoughts must go through a childs head as they make sense of the world. 

As someone who had a mother and a father who lived together...I still experienced these emotions.  As much as I assumed I would marry a girl, I still couldn't help but fantasise about kissing Freddie Prince Jr dressed as Fred from Scooby Doo!  Realising my sexuality was a very long and painful process.  What we need here is parents who are more open to discussing issues with their children, who aren't uncomfortable explaining things to their children, and who don't pass on their own closed-mindedness.  A same-sex couple can explain to their parents, in the same way I explained to my three year old nephew; some boys like girls, and some boys like boys.  Explaining homosexuality to children is extremely easy, it's when you try to tell them that it's wrong it becomes difficult.  There are actually quite a number of childrens books aimed at tackling issues like this, and if you'd like a list, I'd be more than willing to oblige.

&gt; You never know though, maybe I'd of thought I'd have been better in care and left in the system instead of being put in that situation. Infact as an adult now I would prefer to be just left in dorms or wherever kids in care sleep. Mind you, then I might be on a life on crime because thinking 'fast money' and asserting dominance by fighting and knocking out the other kids might have been how I felt like I was somebody.

I'm assuming your source of information for these comments is the widely acclaimed musical ""Annie""?  Whilst I do have fond memories of that movie, I'm afraid it's not quite like the real thing.  It's unlikely that you'll be scrubbing the floors with a cast of girls singing ""It's a Hard Knock Life"", and it's also unlikely that a millionaire Mr Warbucks is going to come and make your life magical and let you keep the puppy.  What you might get however, is a complete lack of family because you're being moved from home to home, you are likely to be interviewed by social workers a lot, you're more likely to fail at school, more likely to be bullied at school, and consequently more likely to drop out as soon as possible, thus leading to less prospects for the future.  A good dose of psychological harm might manifest itself later in the form of depression amongst other things.  The BBC did a fantastic and extremely moving documentary which followed the lives of some children in the social care system, and if you watch that I'm sure you'll see what a painful and heartbreaking process it is.  If you would like, I'd be more than happy to find it for you.

&gt;perhaps with lesbians it wouldn't be so bad because that's woman love.

I don't *quite* know what ""woman love"" is, but I assume you're referring to the whole idea of a mother's loving embrace etc.  All I can say is that you should go and look out to the world, and see that not all mothers are so loving.  Certainly, to my knowledge, science has not found a way to prove that a mother loves her child more than a father...afterall, can you quantify love!? 

&gt;I just feel like it is necessary to evaluate this properly, for ourselves, rather than abiding by the notion that its just pure discrimination because same sex couples can adopt.

We have evaluated this for ourselves...who do you think decided that it's discrimination in the first place?  Do you think these rights were a benevolent gift from our enlightened government?  No, gay rights activists have had to campaign for that, in much the same way they had to campaign to have their own existence recognised.

Anyway, I know that's a bit long, but I really do hope you look more closely at what I've said, and more importantly, what **you've** said.  I am a teacher, I currently work specifically with children who have severe additional support needs, and I will be more than willing to adopt a kid with ASN if that's what life gives me.  I have just as much desire to have my own children as anyone else!  I have just as much capacity for love and compassion as anyone else!  I understand children as much as anyone else!  Having worked in secondary schools, I'm acutely aware of how cruel life can be for children, and I hope to God I can strengthen my kids enough to deal with the possibility of homophobic remarks at school.  Remarks which stem from a homophobic attitude much like the one *you* have expressed; that homosexuality is a lesser form of love.  That it is not capable of sustaining children, nor capable of enriching the institution of marriage.

**Tl;dr - If you want to help the children of same sex couples; don't take them away from their parents.  Teach your own children how to be tolerant.**",0,1360983721,null,0,false,0,c8g0pyo,t3_18l3zs,t1_c8g0pyo,t1_c8fxplr,null,1431307940,29,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,29

* Biere Speciale allowance - £10
* Smoking - £10

I was fortunate enough to get my rent frozen between 2nd and 3rd year as a condition of quickly renewing the lease with the land lord. There were overheads in the form of one off payments like tv license but I think that was roughly £20 each.

Some weeks were more expensive than others and naturally others cheaper than some (when I was away for summer/easter/winter).

I didn't work at Uni but instead worked all my summer holidays and the occasional days in Winter.

Compared to my housemates and coursemates I lived very frugally. many of my housemates were doing 3 nights out a week which I found not only challenging financially but also to fit around the work load of 3rd year.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I read your first quote to me, then a bit of the bold text, then the TL:DR.

That means you didn't read my post.  If you don't want to learn or to try and see something from a different perspective, that's fine...but I would advise you not to voice your ill-informed opinions.

&gt;So, as you're a gay male I feel as though you shouldn't be trying to debate with straight males like that, we're just different man.  I don't go onto gay forums, and specifically push 'straight acceptance', trying to make gay people feel 'dirty' for being who they are.

I see, so reddit is a ""straight forum"" is it?  No one notified me (or the rest of the reddit community).  It is no more a forum for straight people than it is a forum for white people, for women, for under 25s etc.  It is a forum for people.  This particular sub is a forum for people living in, or interested in the United Kingdom.  That is all. 

And the reason you don't need to preach 'straight acceptance' is because there's no need to.  Straight people are not granted any less rights than gay people (quite the opposite) nor do they face discrimination for it in daily life.  Plus, at no point did I make anyone 'feel dirty for being straight'. 

&gt;You shouldn't be trying to make me think differently right now by quoting me and addressing your picked out points in which you disagree with

I think I replied to just about every word you said in your previous comment...how were my point's ""picked out""?!  I certainly hit all of your major points...which I realise you haven't replied to. 

&gt;I mean, if it's less tax payer money keeping children in care and they aren't more likely to be gay or 'hurt in any way mentally', then yeah I might consider supporting this.

It's **more** tax payers money keeping children in care, and the children of same-sex couples are **no more** likely to be gay than the children of heterosexual couples.  There have been ""proper studies"" done on this, and if you looked them up you would easily see that.

&gt;just debating by quoting to me won't change my opinion

I didn't simply quote you.  I quoted you so that I could divide what you said into different points, therefore making it easier for me to make a rebuttal.  If you look under the quotes...you'll see the rebuttal.  You seem to like bold so let me do this...**THIS IS A REBUTTAL!**

It's hard to take this comment seriously when, by your own admission, you haven't even read my entire comment.

And finally, people aren't downvoting you because you're not a lefty and they are.

It seem all stories after that are based on that one. While there have been rumors of it since then, Smith himself denied it to the [Radio Times](http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-08-28/matt-smith-on-the-doctor-who-50th-anniversary---i-doubt-therell-be-a-regeneration) a week after the story started making the rounds.

&gt;Smith had previously scotched rumors that he'd signed up to play the Time Lord beyond his 50th year, telling press at the launch of series seven opener ''Asylum of the Daleks'': ""I don't know where this talk of the 2014 contract came from ... I haven't signed anything new.""

As of December 2012, Smith told the [Telegraph](http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2012/12/24/interview-with-%E2%80%98doctor-who%E2%80%99-star-matt-smith-%E2%80%98the-essence-of-the-show-is-the-same-old-alien-hot-chick-travel-through-the-universe%E2%80%99/) in response to ""Are you doing the next one [series]?""

&gt;Well, I might be. I hope so. Yeah, 2014, who knows? We’ve got a 50th anniversary and then after that of course – that goes out in November – so one assumes there’ll a Christmas special after that and I would hope to be a part of it. I take each year as it comes.

I could be wrong and, if so, I apologize, but it's all up in the air. Until the BBC puts out a definitive statement it's all rumors and guessing games. Only time will tell.

You make some interesting historical points but I'd argue you have it the wrong way round: society is not more liberal because of technology ... Our modern technological society exists *because of liberalism* and *in spite of* conservatism. 

The default state of humanity a thousand years ago was feudalism: life was nasty, brutal and short (often even if you were a noble) for centuries. 
Pretty much every advancement and new idea that took us away from that was opposed, often violently, by the conservatives of the day.

- The rise of towns, guilds and merchant classes
- Limiting the power of monarchy
- Moving from merchantsism and protectionism to free trade (once upon a time Adam Smith was the new kid with scary ideas)
- Almost every idea to come out of the Renaissance
- The scientific method
- The Enlightenment
- The industrial revolution (seriously read what the aristocratic establishment thought of industrialists !)
- Oh yes, the agrarian revolution too for that matter.
- Ending slavery
- public education 
- Extending the vote (fantastic example: fought by conservatives every step of the way when given to townsmen, all men them women)
- The NHS

The 'establishment' at the time are often made uncomfortable by new things because they threaten the status quo (in which they have a comfortable position thank you very much) .. and frankly learning to think in new ways and accept change takes a bit of effort.

Face it my friend: across history conservatives have been wrong about almost everything significant and opposed almost every new good idea. The irony is the conservative position in any given century would have been unacceptably liberal to a conservative a couple of generations beforehand.

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"&gt; No they can't honestchristian! They fucking can't! It's not that you and I have ""different views"", it's a fucking fact that gay people aren't allowed to ""have a ceremony or blessing in any church that would allow them too; with music and reading or whatever they wanted"".

oh dear, you weren't paying attention. I never said the ceremony was an actual civil partnership. I said they could have it blessed or recognised in any church that would agree to do so. Point being those who want a religious element to their union can access that, from any religious group who will. 

Religious groups are not allowed to carry out civil partnerships, but they are allowed to carry out all kinds of religious ceremonies and blessings for the civil partnered. 

&gt; Could you please tell me what wording I used that seems to be dangerously close to supporting discrimination against churches?

Because your original point was that there existed 'unequal legal rights'. When clarifying, all you mentioned was that they couldn't have a civil partnership carried out in a church. I pointed out that whilst that's true, it doesn't represent discrimination, because anyone who wanted to bless a civil partnership can do so. I don't see how you are going to get rid of the so called 'discrimination' unless you not only *allow* religious groups to carry out civil partnerships (note: not sure why this matters anyway as it's not a 'legal right' to have a religious ceremony for anything), but to actually *require* them to recognise same sex partnerships as they currently do marriages. 

To sum up; the issue is more complex than your black and white view. 

&gt; I think it's extremely distasteful and I think this moment would not be inappropriate to vent some outrage at all the outrageous stunts the Sun has pulled over the years.

I agree this is opinion and we differ. We can still be friends. 

&gt; In which case just downvote and move on - that's what you do if you think a topic is not relevant to the subreddit.

I disagree, this subreddit exists for discussions. I am allowed to share my opinion just as everyone else. I actually upvoted the article because I think it's interesting and I like to discuss things. 

&gt;  I still don't quite believe that you're not defending the Sun though - you say you're not defending them, you're just trying to convince people not to attack them . . .

it's more subtle than that. I'm trying to get people to question their motivations for attacking the sun, and whether similar vitriol would have been poured out against the guardian (or huffington post). and why it matters.

&gt;  It's not unhealthy for society to call it out on it's continuous bullshit.

well I just think its pointless. The Sun exists and has influence because of the people that buy it. It would be more appropriate to target the audience than the supplier.

&gt;Wales has become a husk of a nation. The decline of the language, the stripping away of links to its history and culture, has induced a kind of dementia. It’s a country which no longer remembers who or what it is – so it simply exists. And accepts the guiding hand of its neighbour.
&gt;
&gt;The removal of the Welsh personality has created a void which is being gleefully filled by the English media’s tub thumping brand of Britishness – the royal family, the Armed Forces, Team GB and all that. And there seems little hope of anything changing.
&gt;
&gt;There’s no fight or energy left. No upsurge of anger. No dissent. No political will. No obvious solution. Just a blank stare, a rugby top and a grim Welsh cheeriness; a nihilistic acceptance of fate. While Scotland gains confidence and considers independence, Wales is left retreating into the arms of its abusive partner and going gently into that good night.

Seems to me there's a contradiction here.  The decline of the language appears to be being related to a removal of Welsh personality. Though clearly culturally, the decline of the language has had a a negative impact, do I, as a South Walian non-Welsh speaker, feel less Welsh? It's impossible to say.  I certainly don't feel English or indeed British as a concept, I am very much Welsh.

The contradiction that I refer to then crops up in the last sentence.  Scotland is ""gaining confidence and considering independence"" (although personally I highly doubt Scots will vote for this) while its native tongue is in a far worse condition than Welsh.  Notwithstanding the fact that I really don't believe the final rhetoric that Wales ""is left retreating into the arms of its abusive partner"" (devolution surely contradicts this), the fact that Scotland is moving away from England without a strong language surely indicates that there are other matters at play here.

Edit: and finally, let's step away from the rhetoric.  It wasn't the whole of England who ""placed a pillow over (the Welsh language's) face and smothered it"" - if we are looking to allocate blame, it would be to English politicians/civil servants (although this would ignore issues such as migration relating to the industrial revolution, open borders etc).

First, Italian food is even more regionalised than British food: you would never get some dishes served in the North common to the South and vice versa, so you'll need to be more specific.

Also, the Italians go small on meats and seafood and big on sauces and flavouring them. British cuisine is at its best when it just brings really good ingredients together to complement each other: beef and horseradish, steak and kidney, lamb and mint, etc. We're not afraid to leave a really good piece of meat on its own with the lightest of seasoning: the Italians would feel the need to work it a lot more in general.

The Michelin star restaurants in Britain nearly all excel in bringing unusual complimentary ingredients together. It's often food that is simple in concept, hard in execution and rather unique.

As a last thought, the French will spend hours to prepare a meal that takes minutes to eat. The Italians spend minutes preparing a meal that takes hours to eat. The Americans spend minutes preparing a meal that they'll eat in minutes, and the Brits spend hours preparing a meal they'll happily eat over many hours.

And it's probably there that the Brit reputation suffers: we used to overcook veg and then serve it as part of a stodgy meal that takes an age to eat.

true,ucbmckee,english,England,"tl;dr British food is rubbish because British people don't give a shit about it not being rubbish.

As an American who has lived in the UK for a bit over five years, I think the main difference is one of culture. Although you can find amazing food here, most English people I've met place a relatively low value on the quality of their food. The standard fare that you get in most people's homes, or that you see most people eat for their 'common' meals, is really quite unimpressive. Convincing someone to have a lunch consisting of anything other than a boring sandwich from Pret, for example, is a chore. When I've seen people try to get 'fancy', they act a bit embarrassed, like they're trying to act posh. It's this 'tall poppy' syndrome that seems to be at play, perhaps. Maybe some of this will change, with the growing popularity of cooking shows like the Great British Bake-off, but I do feel comfortable saying that Britain does not have a culinary culture en masse.

America, by contrast, places a much higher emphasis on the quality of its food. Or, perhaps, there's a greater acceptance of experimentation and trying to be 'fancy'. Across all economic levels, I think there's greater pride in being able to cook a good meal. Certainly, there's a greater acceptance of culinary diversity. Ethnic food in the UK, whether it's Indian, Mexican, Chinese, etc., has all been perverted significantly to be palatable to British tastes (fewer spices, sweeter, more homogeneous texture/flavouring). Although such perversion also occurs in the US, from comparison in my travels to the 'source' countries, it happens to a much lesser extent. What I do know, at least, is that I've had far, far better luck eating meals in random American homes and at random American restaurants (regardless of state) than I've had in London and its environs. Admittedly, some of this may be new to America - certainly, growing up in the 70s, most of the food I remember was pretty awful - but there has undoubtedly been a change in culinary culture since then that has elevated the quality of American food.",0,1361015634,null,0,false,0,c8g5w7z,t3_18mcrn,t1_c8g5w7z,t1_c8g4y9s,null,1431311064,-19,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-19

They just didn't seem to serve them unless asked, and when they did you just got a few peas and soggy green beans or something. 

I also didn't find the food we happened to eat all that different to what's available over here. Obviously there's the problem of not knowing where the best local restaurants are but from a fairly random sampling I left a bit disappoionted to be honest. In fact my most memorable experience was eating a beef stew type thing which despite being starving I simply couldn't finish.

&gt;&gt; you need to accept that driving at that speed can cause just as much danger as speeding by the same amount

&gt; So doing 20 on a windy and wet 30 road is more dangerous than doing 40 on the same road?

Why would you assume that?

It's a matter of driving an appropriate speed for the road conditions (I believe the advanced driving test uses very similar wording to that, and will even encourage speeding in order to meet the appropriate speed). 

If it's a matter of driving an appropriate speed for the road conditions, then it's evident that if your driving instructor is urging you to drive faster, it's safer to drive faster.

No one is telling you to drive 90 in the rain.

If I'm behind you and you're driving too slowly, I'll assume you're dangerous - I'll assume that you're driving that slowly because you're 70+ years old or because you're asleep at the wheel (or otherwise not paying attention) or that you just don't have good reactions or road-skills.

true,Mr_Wolfgang_Beard,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"With all due respect honestchristian I think you're absolutely full of shit on the Gay Marriage issue. You're deliberately misleading with your own statements and you dodge around actually addressing my own points. You're either a good troll or a good politician. Let's go through this point by point:

 * I started off this discussion by saying that [homosexual couples don't have equal rights to hetrosexual couples](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/18kvx6/if_only_a_hot_woman_could_get_murdered_every_day/c8fqxdo).  
 * You said they do have equal rights: [*""I think it is both logical and consistent* [to say] *that civil partnerships already gave gay couples identical (equal) legal rights.""*](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/18kvx6/if_only_a_hot_woman_could_get_murdered_every_day/c8fr0ql)  
 * I gave an example of a right that hetrosexuals had that homosexuals did not, and stated that that this was clear discrimination: [*""homosexuals aren't allowed to play music or have religious scripts read during a ceremony for a civil partnership, and religious institutions are not legally permitted to perform civil partnerships. Those are all things that are allowed for hetrosexual marriages. It's clearly discrimination.""*](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/18kvx6/if_only_a_hot_woman_could_get_murdered_every_day/c8frzir).  
 * You repeated to state that homosexuals have the same rights as heterosexuals: [*""you raised the legal rights; the legal rights were identical in civil partnerships.""*](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/18kvx6/if_only_a_hot_woman_could_get_murdered_every_day/c8fs6vu) and proceeded to imply that the example I gave was untrue: [*""They could have a ceremony or blessing in any church that would allow them too; with music and reading or whatever they wanted.""*](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/18kvx6/if_only_a_hot_woman_could_get_murdered_every_day/c8fs6vu)
 * I said that you're wrong, and repeated myself by giving that example of a legal right that homosexuals don't have that hetrosexuals do and providing quotes to back me up [*""It's not that you and I have ""different views"", it's a fucking fact that gay people aren't allowed to 'have a ceremony or blessing in any church that would allow them too; with music and reading or whatever they wanted'.""*](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/18kvx6/if_only_a_hot_woman_could_get_murdered_every_day/c8fv67z)

Now you have the fucking nerve to come out with this statement!  
&gt;[your original point was that there existed 'unequal legal rights'. When clarifying, all you mentioned was that they couldn't have a civil partnership carried out in a church. I pointed out that whilst that's true, it doesn't represent discrimination [...]](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/18kvx6/if_only_a_hot_woman_could_get_murdered_every_day/c8g4iml)

Pardon me if I've missed it, but at what fucking point in this conversation do you think you actually agreed that homosexuals have fewer rights than heterosexuals?! This is the first fucking time you've admitted that there aren't equal rights between the two groups! You *never* 'pointed out that that was true', you just argued with it over and over untill I pointed out that it was a fact. Don't pretend that you've used reasonable arguments in this debate - you've twisted and turned like a snake, and now that I've pinned you down in one spot you claim you were always in that spot.  
It's shit like this that makes me and others think you're a troll.

Let's move onto the next illogical and inconsistent thing you've just said:  
&gt;oh dear, you weren't paying attention. I never said the ceremony was an actual civil partnership.

You slimy git. It's technically true - you never said that the ceremony was an actual civil partnership. [That doesn't mean I'm wrong though](http://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/the-fallacy-fallacy). It actually just spreads light on your bullshit once again, because believe it or not - I never claimed that civil partnerships couldn't be blessed afterwards in a church. It's extremely suspicious honestchristian:  
I said heterosexuals couples can have their relationship legally recognised and religiously blessed and play music all at the same time, but homosexual couple can't. You tried to counter that by saying that [they have the same rights, and can have their legally recognised relationship blessed while playing music](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/18kvx6/if_only_a_hot_woman_could_get_murdered_every_day/c8fs6vu). I flat out don't believe that you were not trying to imply that homosexuals have identical rights to heterosexuals, I think you deliberately left yourself enough space to wriggle out of it if you backtracked. Ultimately that is beside the point though, because what we're left with is square one again: ""I think that homosexuals don't have equal rights to heterosexuals and that this is discrimination - you disagree""

Let's move on to the next illogical and inconsistent thing you've just said:  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Obviously this thread isn't about Gay marriage so you don't have to discuss it if you don't want to, I'm just pointing this out as one topic where you seem to speak illogically and inconsistantly.

&gt;&gt;&gt;[...] You seem to be dangerously close to wanting to force churches who don't recognise gay marriage as marriage to have to perform them. 


&gt;&gt;Could you please tell me what wording I used that seems to be dangerously close to supporting discrimination against churches?

&gt;[...] I don't see how you are going to get rid of the so called 'discrimination' unless you not only allow religious groups to carry out civil partnerships [...], but to actually require them to recognise same sex partnerships as they currently do marriages.  
To sum up; the issue is more complex than your black and white view.

I'm sorry, but all you've actually said there is you don't understand how something works so you're just going to ignore what I've said and be scared of something that won't happen. [I've even given you a source specifically stating that what you think will happen won't happen](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/18kvx6/if_only_a_hot_woman_could_get_murdered_every_day/c8fv67z). What do you make of that honestchristian? You've stated that not giving equal rights to homosexuals is not discrimination against them because if they did have equal rights then churches would be discriminated against. I've just told you for the second time that you are incorrect to think that. What do you have to say about that? You might not understand why you're wrong, but that is irrelevant unless you can prove that you're actually correct.  
The issue isn't actually very complex at all, you've just said you don't understand it. It's very simple: gay people should be allowed to have their relationship legally recognised in the exact same manner that straight people are allowed to have their relationship legally recognised.  

Let's move on to the next illogical and inconsistent thing you've just said:  
&gt;(note: not sure why this matters anyway as it's not a 'legal right' to have a religious ceremony for anything)

You're now trying to distract and deflect away from the argument. No one is trying to say that it *is* ""a legal right to have a religious ceremony for anything"", and there's no need to bring that up. I'm just pointing out that heterosexual people have a legal right to have a religious ceremony, but homosexual people don't and I think that is wrong. They should have *equal rights*.  
Either give homosexuals the same rights as heterosexuals, or take away the rights that homosexuals don't have from the heterosexuals. Because as you said yourself honestchristian *""it's not a 'legal right' to have a religious ceremony for anything""*, so as long as everyone is treated equally by the law at the end of it, I don't care how it's done.

Hopefully by now you can see why I and others have accused you of being a troll. Your arguments and debates are full of holes and logical inconsistancies. You say things and then go back on them, you are misleading when you describe your own opinion, you deliberately phrase things in precise ways that you know will be interperated as invalid arguments and then act all pleased with yourself when you reveal that what you said wasn't actually wrong (it was just irrelevant to the discussion) and then use that to imply that the other person is therefore wrong, you flat out lie about things you've said, the list goes on and on.

This kind of behaviour in a debate winds people up, and when it happens over and over and over people are going to call you out on it and start to wonder if really you aren't trying to change anyone's mind, and maybe you just want to troll them.",0,1361017420,null,0,false,0,c8g61v2,t3_18kvx6,t1_c8g61v2,t1_c8g4iml,null,1431311136,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,womblybat,null,null,"I was taught that when pulling out at a junction, if you are doing it right ie at an appropriate gap in traffic, you should be able to complete the transition without forcing the car that ends up behind you to slow down. Ie you have time to get up to speed with the traffic on the road. Moving with the flow of traffic prevents a build up of vehicles behind you or sudden braking when the driver behind realizes you aren't going to manage his/speed in time. This is all based around the idea that traffic built up behind a slower vehicle drives closer together increasing risk of collision at rapid breaking etc. Smaller gap= less time to react. Also reduces risk of inadvisable maneuvers like impatient idiots overtaking inappropriatly. It does however bank on the general speed of traffic being the recommended speed ie. at or just under the limit. If you are doing 35 in a 40 zone that could be considered reasonable. In some countries going 10% under the speed limit is a finable offense on dual-carriageways/motorways. At the end of the day it is better to go a little slower if you are not confident rather than have an accident as long as your lower speed isn't going to be cause of an accident itself. However there should come a point in your learning process when you can comfortably drive at the recommended speed on most roads.

true,suo,uk,Blighty,"&gt; Ethnic food in the UK, whether it's Indian, Mexican, Chinese, etc., has all been perverted significantly to be palatable to British tastes (fewer spices, sweeter, more homogeneous texture/flavouring).

I hate this perception of Westerners. I've been abroad where locals have said, 'Oh, our food is too hot for your palette'. and every fucking time it's a walk in the park. I know more British people who grow insanely hot chillies and who eat insanely spicy food than any Indian I've ever met. I've also been coerced by a group of Indian friends in Dubai to come join them at a restaurant which serves, 'the spiciest food around', only to consume everything they throw at me without wincing like they expected me to. 

It's so fucking annoying when people say, 'our food is too hot for you'. No it isn't mate. Dave down the road cooks hotter fucking curries than that. 

Also, most Indian cuisine you find in the UK was invented here so they're not necessarily perversions of original recipes. As for Chinese and Mexican food the UK has nowhere near the same amount of diaspora from those countries as does America. For that reason you guys are more likely to get a wider taste of their cuisine which is more likely to be more authentic too. 

&gt;  Maybe some of this will change, with the growing popularity of cooking shows like the Great British Bake-off, but I do feel comfortable saying that Britain does not have a culinary culture en masse.

I think we've had our fare share of cooking programmes over the last 20 or so years, Masterchef, Ready Steady Cook, Delia Smith etc... 

&gt; What I do know, at least, is that I've had far, far better luck eating meals in random American homes and at random American restaurants (regardless of state) than I've had in London and its environs.

This surprises me actually. I've always argued that real British food is ALL about home cooking. Pub grub is what gives us a bad rep because they're mostly poor attempts at Shepherds Pie's, Sunday Roasts, Toad in the Hole etc.. that your mum or nan would make at home.

Great in theory but not every vehicle out there is a modern car. A significant proportion are 1990's made and could have rear drums, no abs etc. Your are also assuming drivers are maintaining their cars and brake systems regardless of vehicle age. 

Another consideration is heavy goods vehicles which need much greater distances to slow down and weigh significantly more. Forcing these to slow unexpectedly could create a very real danger. 

And driving over 100mph is never safe because whilst the vehicle might be capable of it, you are the limiting factor. You cannot react quickly enough to situations as they arise.

Tooting is a good choice but be careful how far you are from public transport. From the place in surbiton  (Zone 6) I stay part time I can be in central London MUCH quicker than my friends in tooting.

Other places to look include Stratford, and the more easterly parts. Not sure if Dalston or thereabouts is still affordable. East and south basically. Cheaper flats can pop up all over if you are willing to spend some time looking. The London property market is very haphazard with lots if ex council flats, which are perfectly nice, but often cheaper (for complicated reasons) and nice areas right next to dodgy cheaper areas. 

Use tfl.gov.uk journey planner to check how long it takes to get from a given place to where you need to be (eg work, or central London generally).

I needed to be able to quickly flick through lots to see if any are relevant to my needs, project and style. Ordering 2/3 over wouldn't be helpful - I don't know what I need before hand, I'm there to find inspiration. Graphic books *are* a format that can't be replaced by the kindle or internet viewing, so would be a reason to keep librarys around. But I understand that I'm in the minority of people that needs to consume them, so they're not available as I need and I just have to buy them or and share through friends. By the same comparison, people who consume library books full stop are in the minority of people in the country, and should find other means to consume books like I do.

The library system is painfully outdated, and that me, my family and all my friends aren't getting value for money is telling - if you are getting value for money you're in the major minority, there's no denying it.

Books are different to a film, but that isn't reason enough for them to be 'free' to all. Being a book does *not* give it special value. If the argument for keeping librarys is that you might not want to buy the book, than DVD rental shops should be publicly funded - but that would be silly. DVD rental shops are on their way to extinction because the consumption format is outdated. The same should be happening to librarys as there isn't a substantial enough demand for them. 

You mention as a society, we've repeatedly collectively decided that books should be available, but times are changing. And many people don't take this view by default anymore. I'm not a fool to mention the older generation will have to die for times to move on, it's just how life works.

That you've called my opinions useless is rather insulting, and it shows there isn't much point even having a discussion with you, as you're will to just blanket anything I say as wrong because you disagree with it.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"What's conspicuously missing from the ideas and activism around this proposal is an actual economic plan. You can reinstate the welfare spending that's been cut (or rather, whose rate of growth has been slowed after the recession). And then what? Spend a lot on infrastructure? Except you have to operate within the margin which creditors are happy with. What we're talking about is by definition marginal variations in spending, and this is conspicuously at odds with the dramatic ideological rhetoric.

Moreover, they're still pretending that fairness miraculously matches up with economic growth, rather than being a pained compromise. We have a certain amount of extra money we could borrow before the interest rate goes to 3%, a certain amount to go to 4%; this money is finite, it is marginal. We have to decide how to allocate it. It is unavoidable that what is immediately fair (increasing welfare spending) is not the same as what will actually improve growth and jobs in the medium and long term (building infrastructure, most obviously motorways and fibre optic).

This is the attraction of opposition, that you can be pleasingly vague, and build a broad coalition. But what is the actual point of it all? You know, really, this has been the problem with the Lib Dems, not how they govern, but how they oppose. They built a party without consistent ideals, and when it came to decision time, half their supporters were shocked at what the other half believed. I can tell you from personal experience, the Lib Dems love their social occasions where no one discusses anything too much in detail.

The reason why people are less interested in this form of opposition than they were in the past is that it's becoming more and more apparent that Britain is no longer a great imperial power that can make decisions through diktat, our role now is to compete on equal terms, as a relatively small player. So our politics is going to become more and more like those of Denmark or Sweden's, less about sweeping ideology, more about pragmatic national interest. Our governments now must first and foremost work within the constraints placed upon them. It's no longer appropriate to pretend we can change the way in which the world works on our own, and to pretend that whoever's in government can just sort everything out with a grand gesture, and the swish of a pen.

Oh for fuck's sake, you simply don't understand the issue. Transgender IS NOTHING TO DO WITH SEXUALITY. If you can't even frame it in the correct terms, your opinion on the matter is absolutely irrelevant.

Julie's piece is akin to calling all black people 'thieving niggers' in its offensiveness to the trans- community. The former isn't acceptable and neither is the latter. Being born into the wrong body is, interestingly enough, considered a disability, here in the UK and trans- people are, by and large, semi-accepted except for bigots like Burchill and yourself (of which there are many in the workplace). I doubt you'd consider it acceptable to slur me for having a birth defect, so why not take that attitude and apply it to trans- people?

If you don't understand the issue, fine. Just don't spout your bullshit opinion as if it matters.

true,TheMemo,blue,The Gentleman,"&gt; I don't think you have the right kind temperament to be a local representative of anyone. 

Probably true, I ended my comment 'your local representative...' rather facetiously as - as you pointed out - my tone is hardly in keeping with that. 

&gt; Everyone has the right to have the piss taken out of them - better?

No. Everyone has the right to take the piss out of someone, but there are limits of acceptability. While I am not saying that someone should be silenced for certain views (I believe in freedom of speech completely and utterly) - though the Observer believed so in this case - if you say things that are racist or otherwise bigoted, you will be called out on them and they will follow you for the rest of your life.

There are consequences to everything you say or do, and the right to take the piss out of someone does not free you from the consequences of angering people.

Furthermore, you equate her words with 'taking the piss' - now I understand you probably have no idea about transgender issues and know no transgender people, but her comment was not harmless, it is comments like hers and the 'gender gatekeeping' that it implies that leads to the significantly higher than average amount of mental health issues and suicides in the trans- community.

&gt; I have written nothing to suggest to you that I am a bigot so please don't call me one.

You consistently misrespresent an issue you clearly know nothing about, and downplay an attack as 'taking the piss.' To someone like myself who has studied concepts such as gender and sexuality for many years, you appear somewhat out-of-touch.

Let's see what she wrote, shall we?

""Though I imagine it to be something akin to being savaged by a dead sheep, as Denis Healey had it of Geoffrey Howe, I nevertheless felt indignant that a woman of such style and substance should be driven from her chosen mode of time-wasting by a bunch of dicks in chick’s clothing.""

""To my mind – I have given cool-headed consideration to the matter – a gaggle of transsexuals telling Suzanne Moore how to write looks a lot like how I’d imagine the Black &amp; White Minstrels telling Usain Bolt how to run would look.""

A group of people, born in the wrong body, desperately trying to get to the point (with painful treatments and surgery) where their physical attributes match what their brain is *telling* them should be there, are equated to the Black and Whit Minstrels - as in - 'you'll never be a proper woman.' I am glad the law disagrees on that point.

""To have your cock cut off and then plead special privileges as women – above natural-born women who don’t know the meaning of suffering, apparently – is a bit like the old definition of chutzpah""

Once again, we see that Julie bigotedly decides that gender is a matter of what you were born with between your legs. Just a shame that the scientific &amp; medical community no longer agrees with that assessment and that we now know that both gender and sexuality are a spectrum that depend on both physical attributes / genetics and socialisation. We also know that physical sex characteristics can develop late, and that some children are born without differentiated sexual organs - and the doctors, at that point, choose the sex of the child. We also know that the brain has distinct differences between the sexes, and those differences support the idea of 'being born in the wrong body.' We also know that gender roles are largely a result of socialisation and have nothing to do with what is between your legs.

People with legs probably don't make fun of those who were born unable to walk but now rely on prosthetic legs. If they did, you'd probably think badly of them.

Both Julie's approach and yours is of minimising the issue and not taking it as the disability and physical ailment that it is.

You're both fine to take the piss, of course, it's just that more compassionate people will think you're a bigoted dick.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"That's a fair point to raise, but it seems to me it's far from clear what the outcome of the coalition's tax policies has been, and whether they are in fact shifting the tax burden from the rich to the poor:

*In favour of the argument:*

* The coalition decreased the top rate tax from 50% to 45%. Labour had previously increased the top rate tax from 40% to 50%, but said it was a temporary measure.

* The coalition put the VAT rate up to 20%.

*Against the argument:*

* The coalition are in the process of increasing the personal allowance, from about £6000 towards £10,000, which is a disproportionate tax rebate for low income earners.

* The coalition increased Capital Gains Tax (essentially, income tax for people who have enough money to make investments), from 18% to 28%, for those people who are earning at the top-rate.

Edit: Also, it seems to me that the anti-coalition activists in the Coalition of Resistance (I think they are consistent enough on this to talk about as a group) are distinctly saying that this isn't just about fairness, but also about economic growth. That's true both for:

* The Green party, who talk about green stimulus - I'm an environmentalist, and very pro-solar, but I recognize that, for instance, paying to install solar panels which will produce electricity at four times the cost of conventional power is a rubbish way to invest in infrastructure.

* Those who want to bolster or increase welfare spending over infrastructure spending, who talk about increasing consumption as stimulus - to some degree, you're talking about choosing to spend money on paying a construction worker to be on JSA, against employing him to build a motorway.",0,1361034590,null,0,1361054133,0,c8g8sss,t3_18muj9,t1_c8g8sss,t1_c8g7ux4,null,1435583916,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

Its impossible for any positive change, the money is now well hoarded away and most will never get a sniff of it. The minimum wages paid out probably are in most cases part of the taxes the employer has avoided paying back to society. (that is if they are paying for their workers in the first place).

It saddens me that people are exchanging their time and lives working for a pittance, only in turn to purchase things made by slaves on the other side of the world, it is a race to the bottom and we are in the last few furlongs.

There needs to be a LOT less emphasis on the belief we need to spend money to have a good time, this starts with children.

There needs to be less distraction through consumerism, so people can really see that they are getting fucked over, time and time again.

There needs to be a big sign saying 'You aren't 'lucky' to have two jobs that pays you the steam off some fatcats piss - you have been born into a system where you and your kids, and their kids too are fucked - the rich have the multipliers in place for their wealth'.

When things do turn bad, which will happen shortly - those with the cash will be in gated communities in the south and the rest of us will just have to survive - being a Yorkshire man i would like to see our counties managed locally and all the wasteful rot removed to be something like it was back in the 90's.

But above all - the kids of today need to see that immediate gratification is not healthy.

Warnock's tactics in the last few games have left a lot to be desired really. I can't remember a time when he made a positive substitution with enough time for them to make a difference rather than a reactionary one.

I also read somewhere that Warnock stated the players available on loan would not have improved the team. Would David Bentley not have been a good one to go for? or is he past it? Why bring in Ryan Hall and Tonge and sit them on the bench? He says we need wingers, well he signed one and doesn't give him a chance. We also had the Robbie Rogers who seemed a decent prospect that never got given a chance once he recovered from injuries. He can't have been as poor as Warnock seemed to think if he has close to 20 caps for the USA? Although I could speculate in light of recent events his mind might not have been in the right place at the time, which is unfortunate

I'm not going to pretend I know anything about managing a football club, but some of the decisions Warnock has made recently have been baffling to say the least.

&gt; flash has DRM, and it works fine on Linux, as does iPlayer

Flash DRM works, but as it's not supported right in hardware it's theoretically possible to just crack the application and read off the unencrypted stream (which is why standards like Trusted Computing and HDMI, which support encryption in hardware, saw such an enthusiastic reception from content-creators).

I'm not aware of what (if any) DRM system the iPlayer uses on its streaming programmes - last I checked it was [basically straight FLV video](http://beebhack.wikia.com/wiki/IPlayer_TV#Comparison_Table), and the only DRM they used was WMV (Microsoft, Windows-specific) on the downloaded files for offline viewing.

Equally, *some* DRM can be implemented at the app level... but these days it's basically just a mild deterrent unless it's also implemented in the OS and hardware level as well, which is why many content-creators heavily invested in DRM (eg, the TV/movie companies supplying Netflix with content) typically tend to insist on that.

DRM itself has a use-case (eg, for rentals), but only at the expense of robbing device owners of control over their own (bought and paid-for) hardware/software... and it radically distorts the relationship between media consumer and producer, to the extent that the media producer basically ends up owning your hardware, at least functionally, if not legally/officially.

There are also those of us who doubt that DRM is even necessary (let alone *moral*) in the first place - it only exists to prop up an obsolete business model based on trying to stuff the genie back in the bottle, creating artificial scarcity in a medium that's inherently post-scarcity, when the realistic, forward-looking (and arguably even *moral*) solution would seem to be to instead embrace the post-scarcity nature of the medium and develop business models that work within that new framework.

The web has done fantastically as an open system based on open standards, and with a compete absence of DRM.  Hell, given this success even many content-creators have started experimenting with DRM-free sales (Amazon MP3, iTunes, Youtube web-series, etc) without suffering unduly from piracy.

Given that freedom, tradition, common expectation and present trends it just seems incredibly regressive to now start baking DRM into HTML5, along with all the user-hostile changes and creeping encroachment onto users' own freedoms, systems and even physical devices that it almost inevitably implies.",0,1361037690,null,0,false,0,c8g9kto,t3_18my1n,t1_c8g9kto,t1_c8g96ku,null,1431312299,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

I also think that the reason the left seems to have been decimated is mainly because of the fuck-ups of New Labour and the first past the post system. I can't see Labour mounting a credible challenge for a generation. The sad thing is I can't see the Tories doing that either and the credibility of the Lib Dems is shot to pieces too.

I think it's important to note the economics of it all. The coalition has to work with what it has available, which isn't much. The decision to bail out the banks wasn't made by the coalition, it was inherited. Furthermore in any coalition it's going to be difficult to get policies through. I actually think the coalition has been the best possible outcome of the last election, with the Lib Dems at least partially pulling back the tories from full blown toryism to an extent, admittedly at the cost of their credibility.

Right or wrong we are where we are with a massive amount of debt on the table and the banks getting away with it.

It's a peculiar thing form, and the championship has thrown up some weird runs of it, such as Barnsely, Bristol and Ispwich all beating teams at the top in recent weeks.

With regards to Warnock I know he hasn't been the best in recent times but the owners have made it clear he'll more than likely be staying till his contract runs out. So we might aswell stick with him till the end for the sake of results.

I believe Rodgers played his debut shortly after he signed but was knocked out in it, this led to another injury and ruled him out for some time.

true,p7r,uk,United Kingdom,"I think your comment about British veg was valid until about 10-15 years ago. Now people tend to cook vegetables much less, and steaming/blanching techniques are now more widespread. 

When I was a kid it was a common joke that the Christmas lunch staple - the brussel sprout - tasted disgusting and made you fart. Then a few TV shows pointed out that was because everybody was overcooking them. Now when you see them on a menu you can expect a bit of crunch, a beautiful and full flavour - quite sweet, in fact - and they're not going to give you wind.

And so it is across the board. The most popular takeaway in Britain is curry. In fact, many curries available in Britain were invented here. If you've ever eaten a Chicken Tikka Masala, you weren't eating an Indian dish but a British one.

Our second most favourite cuisine is probably Italian - or at least a sort of mediterranean fusion. Mezze is now as easy to find as Masala. We ""get"" what the French and Germans do and incorporate some of their ideas and recipes into our own cooking. Spanish, Greek and Lebanese restaurants all flourish. Eastern European specialities are now commonly found in supermarkets (thanks to a recent influx of Eastern Europeans), and there isn't a single type of booze from a single corner of the planet that is not enjoyed somewhere within the four corners of this little island every weekend.

And all of that has informed the rest of our cooking and eating.

British cuisine is all about fusion, but in the original sense rather than the modern ""let's throw some spring rolls and prawn crackers next to this green curry"" interpretation. 

British chefs are obsessed with one question: what can you bring together to make an amazing taste combination that hasn't been thought about before? Some British foodies like me might even own a [flavour thesaurus](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0747599777?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3194&amp;creative=21330&amp;creativeASIN=0747599777&amp;linkCode=shr&amp;tag=vagueware-21&amp;qid=1361040835&amp;sr=8-1).

The technical execution has traditionally been lacking because the combinations have been so good that the execution didn't need to be there: you'd have to be a moron to mess up most British dishes. My girlfriend until recently never bothered to time cooking pasta!

As we've taken more from the rest of the world the technical execution has had to improve, and that's why cooking shows are more and more popular on UK TV. All the top TV chefs honed their craft abroad (Oliver in Italy, Ramsey in France, etc.), and then brought those skills and ideas back to British recipes.

That caused other chefs to up their game and get better and better, to the point where we now have chefs whose technical skills are off the scale (e.g. Blumenthal), and inspiring home cooks to up their game.

So today British cuisine is far removed from over cooked sprouts.

It's now about taking the best ingredients from our farms and seas (and those from around the World), ideas and recipes from across the globe including Europe and the old ""Empire"", and improved technical execution.

It is therefore, in short, some of the best food in the World.

Just follow the advice elsewhere in this thread: avoid food in chain pubs and chain restaurants (Bella Italia is as bad a place as any ""Steakhouse""), search out the top reviewed places you can, be willing to try ""British"" outlets actually taking ideas from other cultures (British street food is doing this very well at the moment, IMO), and look for classic combinations done technically well, but also don't be afraid of things that ""sound"" weird like ""cabbage mousse"", available in one of my local restaurants.

And never pass up a chance for a Sunday roast in an independent pub or restaurant, accompanied with a good quality cask ale. Go for the beef, ask for horseradish, and check out the roast potatoes and yorkshire puddings and how it all goes together so well.

FSG seriously screwed the pooch on this one. In going for a younger, better squad, we lost the leadership we needed. It was done to meet a bottom line, not to win the league. 

FSG will learn from this mistake and try and keep older players on, who have leadership quality, but on smaller wages. I expect Gerrard to stay and just be the senior player LFC needs, Downing will have to change his attitude to stay otherwise he will be sold to cover his transfer fee, Skrtel needs to become a leader like Agger, and Suarez, while playing unbelievably well, needs to lead by example and be a role model for the youngsters. 

As for any transfers in, I think we an older, elite winger. Someone to connect the midfield to the attack and be a game changer. Obviously, Ronaldo is out of the question. But, someone like him. The explosiveness, the air of importance, and the ability to change a game are qualities needed for us.

And you think I don't? He's gone his way and I hope it works out for him, but his time at City definitely didn't bring out the best in him.

&gt; He loves City, he said he loves the fans and we loved him.

He may have loved the fans, I know some fans loved him, but City? I can't be sure that he loved City. I'd have to see some proof, and unfortunately, there wasn't much on the pitch.

&gt;  It wasn't the right environment for us or him of late and so that had to change.

You mean we weren't easily winning? He never came on and put in 120% when we were losing. He just skulked around, not even trying to get back into it. Deny it, go ahead.

&gt; I find it absolutely impossible to dislike him, he doesn't have a bad bone in his body. He is clearly loving his football and very happy and there is no reason for us not to be happy for him.

I understand, I don't wish bad things upon him, but I'm done with that chapter, I'm glad he left, we can focus now on football rather than ego. Maybe this isn't what you agree with, maybe I should be all loving and worship our players, but that kinda respect has to be earnt. When you play like Micah Richards, like Zabaletta, like Garry Barry, like SWP, then maybe you'll get my respect, but Balotelli acted like we were an inconvenience, and that hurt me every time he didn't give a shit.

The grocery store near my last home (Berkeley Bowl) had no fewer than 20 varieties of apples, 15 varieties of tomatoes, etc. And the quality of them all was far, far superior to what you can pick up here. Some of this may have been influenced by living in California, which is an amazing place for fresh, flavourful ingredients, but I've lived in other states and travelled extensively and the freshness and choice of both meat and veg is generally superior.

&gt; CRAIG MURRAY: Well, his fear is that he would very quickly be extradited on from Sweden to the United States, either extradited or rendered. And the Swedes actually now have a sort of legal rendition law for speedy temporary rendition to the United States, as it’s called. That’s what is worrying Julian Assange. Though I should say, I mean, my experience of the way they treat whistleblowers and my experience of what we have seen of the process in Sweden, I would say there must be just as big a fear that he will be unjustly convicted of rape, which I’m quite sure he hasn’t done. But if he arrives in Sweden, he will immediately be jailed. There’s no provision for bail. And the thing which most people don’t understand is that rape trials in Sweden are held entirely in secret, so nobody would ever see any of the evidence. The next thing we will hear is the verdict. My own view is the most likely scenario is that it’s been cooked up well in advance and that verdict will be guilty. And it’s very possible to do that because not only is the trial held in secret but there is no jury.

They want to do so to get access to all the stuff which, to be blunt, you have blithely taken for granted, and which is bought with prosperity, and/or created with modern industrial civilization- decent healthcare, ability to travel and move around in cars or planes, access to TVs, computers, mobile phones, washing machines and dishwashers that mean that people don't have to spend hours each day doing backbreaking chores, fridges to store interesting food, varied food itself, and on and on and on. And these genuinely useful inventions are constantly being added to, new therapeutics or diagnostics (see all the venture capital pouring into stem cells), new ways to generate electricity without fossil fuels, cars which are more efficient (plug in hybrids are a complete revolution in modern civilization, which previously relied on oil almost completely). I want to live in a country which not only has equitable access to these things, but which is pushing forward, and making a contribution.

We have been integrated in spain-by force, after the UK betrayed us in 1714- for the last 299 years, being independent for more than 1000 prior to that. 

We reffer to Catalonia as our own country, in contrast to the spain, which is the ""state"" or superstructure we are integrated. 

The solution to your problem? very easy, get independent, until then nobody will take you seriously. I have to admit, and you as well, that you have it quite easy under the UK. Even though Wales is the poorest ""home nation"" int he UK you get all the perks, and recognition under the British system; in contrast, we are in a perpetual struggle to even mantain our identity and sovereignity inside spain; no matter how hard we had it, no one paid attention to us until our government started to opnely seek independence.

Not too bad for a crippled old man.

ANYWAY, truth be told I'm not especially keen on Villa coming here unless it's at a reasonable price, since he probably only has 1-2 more seasons left in him.

Firstly, if you are from Catalonia, however good your English is, it's not your native tongue, correct? Allow me to explain:

Region: Noun
An area or division, esp. part of a country or the world having definable characteristics but not always fixed boundaries.

Is Catalonia and autonomous community? Yes. Is it independent? No. Is it a region? Yes. Now, I was not trying to insult you by calling Catalonia a region, but it is a geographically correct term, is it not?

Secondly, was my question: how do I get people to take my country seriously? Or was it: how do I educate people about Wales? I think you will find it's the latter. I came here to find a suggestion on how best to desribe my country, the same way you no doubt have to explain the situation of your country (oh wait, sorry, you're not a country, yet) to others. 

Do I profess to know everything about European politics? No. Do I hold it against people here that they don't know the situation of Wales? No. I came here to simply ask a question on how to explain it.

Reina is on the down slope ever though he is still good I think if this is the case he is one to go. Coates hasn't shown enough to stay.

Downing - 10 mil 
Coates - 7 mil 
Andy - 15 mil 
Then the guys who won't make it, like Eccleston, Pacheco, Spearing, Wilson, Gulacsi, Flanno, etc.  Bringing in another 5 mil total.  

That's 37 mil...plus what the owners give us (30-40 mil) I'll round it to 70 mil to spend. 

We'd need a LB to cover/compete with Enrique. 
2 CBs to cover/compete with Skrtel and Agger 
a RW to replace downing
Probably another Winger who can possibly play as a striker 
A CAM who can score 
hopefully a thug CDM

German clubs are generally decent deals, he'll be down to the last year on his contract, so despite the fact he's worth almost double that in normal terms, I think we could get him very cheap (look at Holtby to Spurs) as he'd leave free in a year.  He can cover RB if Kelly keeps getting hurt, but can also be a starting CB, with Agger.  3 good players for 2 spots creates competition and with how many games we play would be good. 


Ashley Williams-8 mil An experienced leader at the back (Captain of Wales and Swansea) gives us much needed experience.  Not the tallest, but fantastic in the air anyway, and would be our new Carragher, except much younger.  BR knows him well, he can come in right away and play for us, add some steel and still use the ball well.  Kind of contingent on us getting into EL, I'd still have him if we didn't but 4 quality CBs would be upset about playing time if we don't have the extra 10-15 games a year to rotate them in.  That said most teams have 4 that can play. 


Bruno Martins-Indi - 10 mil The left back is young, but a huge talent.  Can play CB as well, adds to us another physical presence, but still good going forward.  Can get a better cross off than Enrique, and will help our set piece problems as he's solid in the air and a great athlete.  


Tom Ince - 6 mil Left footed winger who has added goals to his game.  I know it's the championship but his stats are incredible.  Think he could at least produce as much as Downing has, on half the wages.  He knows the club, wants to be here, and can be a fantastic squad player.  Might not be a regular starter, so good to go with a cheap option.  With our 35% ""sell on"" fee for training him, we'd only pay about 4 mil 


Kevin Gameiro 8 mil - He's got movement similar to Borini, but is actually a more polished scorer.  Can play wide, or through the middle, and just has a fantastic sense of when to make the run off the ball.  Think he could just absolutely feast off service from Suarez and Sturridge, and those 3 could play together and completely destroy defenses, as they're all goal scorers.  He's the additional ""winger/striker"" we sign. 


Christian Eriksen - 10 million pounds another huge opportunity as he's got 1 year on his contract.  People claiming we're already in talks for him, I think he's the #10 that BR wants.  Goals, assists, vision, skill on the ball, 2 footed...think he'd be fantastic for us.  


Geoffrey Kondogbia - 10 mil Big, strong CDM who is still under the radar despite his performances for Sevilla and the France youth national teams.  He's got a silky smooth touch as well, could be like Sissoko before his eye problems.  Adds a bit of steel without sacrificing possession, and could be available cheap given Sevilla's financial problems.  Also gives us a left footed CM to give us some balance in the middle. 


That leaves us with:

-----------------------Reina 

-----Johnson---Howedes--Agger--Martins-Indi

----------------Gerrard-----Lucas

----------------------Eriksen 

-----Suarez----------Sturridge----------Gameiro 


and 

----------------------Jones 

----Kelly--------Skrtel-----(Martins-Indi)---Enrique 

----------------Allen----Kondogbia

--------------------Hendo

That said, I have always been a Bayern fan, that wavered a bit as I don't get the German league on TV here and other things like that, the coverage just isn't as good so that took a back seat.  But as an 8 year old I was obsessed haha, my family even flew over for Christmas one year to see one of Lothar Matthaus's last games in Germany.  


I became a bit of a Sevilla fan as I studied abroad in Seville and lived about 100 yards from the stadium.  Went to a few games, got to really support the team for a few months, and made some good friends who are fellow fans so it's a good way to keep in touch, and the team grows on you when you care about people that are also fans, and thats your way to stay in touch.  Always liked them before that too, but that time there made me a ""fan"" so to speak. 


Finally I've also always supported my local team here in the US, DC United.  Season tickets for many years, and will always be a fan of them as well.

true,Lokopopz,lfc99,,"Carroll's already gone AFAIK for somewhere in the region of £17m?   

Skrtel hasn't been great this season, but the whole defensive thing this season has been very up and down.

Coates needs to go on loan to get experience. 2 years ago he was Uruguayan U-21 player of the tournament when they won. (fairly sure that's accurate, hazy memory)

Reina to Barca looks like it'll happen either in the summer, or next summer, but atm he's first choice, and we're seeing flashes of class, but also questionable decision making. But now that Butland has gone, Ter Stegen has gone, i would love us to hold on to him as i'm unaware of any good ""upcoming"" prospects. But this is just the rumour mill, Man Utd were apparently looking to sell De Gea, which would've instigated the idea that Casillas would move, Valdes would move and Reina would move, but then he goes and has a stormer and it's all ""ohh yeah he's maturing and he's great, he'll be the the #1 for years"". (as an aside to this though, i think the most likely target if Reina does go is Begovic, as he's a great keeper [albeit behind a very strong defence], the implication being that Stoke bought Butland for next season, ergo Begovic will be moving on.)

Henderson is a starter atm, no chance of him moving, he looks class and will only get better, so he won't go. 

Enrique, we're woefully short at LB already, don't think he'll go. (yes he's been out of form lately, but that's more to injury than anything else imo...)

Downing, probably going to go, yes he had a bad first season, and yes he's gotten better this season, but it seems fairly inevitable that he's on his way out just because of how bad that first season was...",0,1361062353,null,0,false,0,c8gfq70,t3_18nwu8,t1_c8gfq70,t3_18nwu8,null,1431315262,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

&gt;  Just because a truck is limited to 56 doesn't mean it is actually capable of GOING 56 

Every truck on the road is and more. They might not be able to go up hills that quickly when fully freighted compared to one with a larger engine but other than that they can do 56MPH. If they couldn't nobody would buy one because time is money.

Why do you think lorries had speed limiters fitted? Its because of people complaining about them speeding. Speed limiters have been around for nearly two decades and speed limiters were made mandatory for all lorries registered after 1/1/1988. Back in 1988 Artics had a maximum GVW of 38 tonnes and typically ran 9 litre 320BHP engines. I used to drive an old 1986 Leyland Roadtrain with a 290BHP engine that had no problem doing &gt;60MPH because it had no limiter fitted. Nowadays they have a max GVW of 44 tonnes but typically run 13 litre 420-460BHP engines. Are you seriously suggesting they're not capable of doing the speeds a truck could do in the mid 80's?

The only reason some trucks are doing 55 whilst others are doing 56 is for the same reason 10 cars driving down the road all with the speedos on 60MPH will all be doing slightly different actual speeds.",0,1361065513,null,0,false,0,c8ggik6,t3_18lr42,t1_c8ggik6,t1_c8g7m1a,null,1431315637,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Begum is a generic term for women. It's like wanting to be 'lady x' or 'ms. x'. It's obviously going to be extremely high. 


Other surnames like Patel, Khan and Singh are generic caste/societal surnames. In many parts of India individuals have a family surname and a caste surname. People often choose one or the other depending on various circumstances, including group identity or distinguishing their own family name.

Interesting example, as there's a fan site [http://www.finalgear.com/](http://www.finalgear.com/) which links to torrents for all the shows, and IIRC the Beeb are aware and have explicitly said they don't intend to do anything about it.

Probably Top Gear is a bit of a special case, though - as close as the BBC gets to commercial advertising, the licensing issues are relatively limited, and there's the Clarkson factor - I wouldn't be surprised if he'd downloaded torrents on the show.

true,mabye,null,null,"I think the reason is that historically, and even recently and in the present for most crimes, not having anonymity really isn't a problem and also has advantages such as the ease of spreading information to obtain more witnesses or information about other crimes. From the other direction, it's in principle a fundamentally desirable thing which is why the right to a public trial is considered a human right...avoiding issues with corruption and also contributing to a healthy court system where information from all cases can freely be shared and compared. For most cases and most crimes, everything functions fine without anonymity and would arguably do worse with it, so we don't have it. 

From this point of view, I think the real problem is the rise of the kangaroo court of public opinion, as presided over by tabloid journalism. This is arguably a relatively recent phenomenon, and is the core of what leads the public trial system to no longer seem fair. With so much of the population swayed to pass early biased judgement and ignore the actual findings of the law, the principle of innocent until proven guilty is potentially breached in a way that normally isn't a problem. I think you can see this in the fact that the entire issue never seems to come up except with rape cases, even though as you say it's strange to think the entire system is like that. Of course, it is a very real phenomenon and perhaps really does merit a reappraisal of the laws.

I'm personally inclined to think the situation is rather more complex than the easy armchair analysis would make it appear. There's presumably a good reason that these proposals are so controversial, but it seems hard to get to the details of why this really is. Some points seem easy to dismiss by writing the word 'what' in bold capitals, but on the other hand statistically it seems likely that there really are very few highly publicised but unjustified rape cases whereas anonymity may well drastically reduce convictions. Perhaps that's a reasonable price to pay, I'm honestly not sure, but it depends entirely on statistics and numbers that are hard to know and which are rarely brought up when the intuitive answer seems so obvious.

I also wonder, if something *does* need to be done, is there an option to limit tabloid justice other than blanket anonymity...though in that direction you hit difficult problems with freedom of the press. That said, you perhaps hit them anyway - nobody was very happy about super-injunctions, for instance.

It's time for Assange to just fucking go to Sweden already and face his accusers (due process) instead of wasting tax-payers money and pandering to the paranoid delusions of conspiracists.

There's a really good part where it shows Ronaldo take a curved and knuckled free kick with a super high speed camera.

If the ball is struck with spin on it, the spin creates a predictable pattern of air pressure in the ball (high pressure near contact side, low on other side I believe) which causes it to swerve in a predictable manner (from high pressure to low pressure side).  If the ball is struck with no spin, the air pressure inside the ball remains relatively evenly spaced out.  This means that the ball is more susceptible to changes in air pressure outside of the ball, and the seam of the ball or a blade of grass is enough to change the pattern of air pressure around the ball significantly enough to alter the course of flight.

I don't have time to re-watch or find the video, but I think I remember the explanation fairly well.  There were articles written about R.A.

true,lapin7,null,null,"In the Bundesliga, we have our international 'friendship' - with Borussia Monchengladbach. That's been going on for a good few years and has its roots in the European Cup final we played against them. There are trips between supporters of the clubs every year. I know it's hot to like Dortmund at the moment because they have the glory, but it would be nice to see more here people be aware of Monchengladbach and Liverpool.

In the SPL, I think there is a misconception (within Liverpool and elsewhere) that Liverpool goes with Celtic and Everton goes with Rangers. But I don't think any kind of sectarian or cultural divide of this sort is really existent. Both clubs have engaged with Liverpool - Rangers have that Ibrox/Hillsborough banner and Celtic have that Justice banner. King Kenny was a Rangers fan turned Celtic hero, which sums it up in a way. Celtic adopted YNWA after Liverpool, I think after Hillsborough, and many current Liverpool songs are based on Rangers and Celtic songs. Certainly the Irish influences in Liverpool and Glasgow mean that a lot of Old Firm supporters are also Liverpool supporters. So there is no answer with regard to the SPL. But you may as well just avoid the mindless hatred and soggy football of Glasgow, if you want my input.

I also think that recently we've had a fairly warm relationship with Barcelona. You can see on youtube that, at Anfield, the visiting Barca supporters sang with YNWA and after the match exchanged songs and applause with the Liverpool supporters at the away end. If you watch it, they chant their hymn that they always do (great song) and then the Liverpool fans applauded and each set of fans chanted for the team of the other. The histories and identities of the two clubs should also be compared. Barca's defiance and sense of cultural individuality is very similar to Liverpool's, and the historically left-wing connections and identities of both clubs are significant. Probably certain things in recent years will have helped me view Barca better, such as the two CL final wins against United, Mascherano's dedication to the Liverpool fans when he won it, and them overshadowing MUFC and RMCF, two teams I find quite distasteful. But this is more of a personal one and it may be stretching it to say there's really a friendship between the two. Some people like Real Madrid because of Xabi and Arbeloa and other things. Personally I think Arbeloa is a disgrace when he plays, like Pepe and Ramos with all the dirty play, and Xabi has a bit of it now too.

And who do I hate? Real Madrid, as I've suggested. Napoli, Lazio, AC Milan.  But there's no one you should hate 'as a Liverpool fan'. Except Napoli.",0,1361074240,null,0,false,0,c8gioz8,t3_18ni8a,t1_c8gioz8,t3_18ni8a,null,1431316726,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8

true,bainesworld,lfc87,,"""I know how I'm supposed to feel about various teams in the EPL""

Why does there have to be a way to feel about certain clubs? Watch some games and decide who you like and who you don't like.  I don't like United, but only because I grew up as a Liverpool supporter in the 80s surrounded by Mancs and the rivalry naturally grew at school, not because someone said I should hate them, i really like Everton because they play very nice football.  I don't see how being told who to like and dislike can enhance the game, if you love the game, make your own mind up.

For what it's worth... In the SPL I like Motherwell and dislike both Rangers and Celtic, despite being a Rangers fan as a kid.  In La Liga I really like both Real and Barcelona (how could you not, there are great to watch) and don't think there is a Spanish team I don't like.  In Italy I like Fiorentina because of their purple kit sponsored by 7Up in the early nineties, I have no problem with Napoli and I don't like either Madrid team.  In the Czech league I support Bohemians as I like their general philosophy, the fans and the stadium in a ten minute walk from my front door.  I like most teams in the Premiership, except Man U, Man C, Chelsea.  I find it funny when Arsenal lose.  On an international level I support England with all my heart, but when the inevitable happens in every tournament I get behind Germany.

However, these are just preferences and I'm only emotionally invested in Liverpool.  Do yourself a favour and make up your own mind, don't worry about what other fans think.  True fans will always will always accept that you like who you like and true fans will always feel close through the club, and the passion for Liverpool is all you need.",0,1361084547,null,0,false,0,c8gkx31,t3_18ni8a,t1_c8gkx31,t3_18ni8a,null,1431317774,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

So murder, violence, theft fraud... charges don't carry ""stigma""?

If you get publicly charged with stealing from your employer that can have a devastating effect upon your future employability, as could a charge for murder, child abuse... by Ms McGowan's reasoning surely the identities of all suspects in all cases should be protected until conviction.

This would surely be problematic as I expect valuable evidence in pretty much every case would be really rather difficult to obtain without disclosing the identity of suspects.

Victims of sex crimes are given anonymity because people have in the past not reported crimes because there's an element of shame (hopefully less now than in the past but it seems to still be extant) in being the victim of a sex crime not present for most other kinds of crime.

I fully realise that a knee jerk reaction based upon initial ideas of fairness would suggest this anonymity works both ways  but upon closer examination that knee jerk reaction is just wrong.

His form hasn't been good recently, but he was our player of the season last year. If he doesn't improve before the summer and we can get a decent price, then I wouldn't be too disappointed, but I wouldn't like to see him go.

He's just started playing well! Unless someone's willing to pay a very good fee I wouldn't support selling him.

Absolutely fucking not.

Playing well recently, but I think that we need a different class of player to mount a top-5 challenge next year. I'd be OK with selling him.

Of course he'd deal with the legal issues before putting that on TV - he's not stupid (or at least not that stupid) and no doubt his on-screen persona is deliberately played up for entertainment value. But he certainly does and says things that get people riled up all the time.

If he has advocated torrents or even used torrents on the show, making a fuss about this would be blatant hypocrisy, and though I don't know whether he has actually done this it would seem consistent with that on-screen persona. That's what I meant.

Actually, I have a vague memory of some reference to Clarkson trying to torrent some piece of music, then contacting the musician because he couldn't get it - getting the CD along with a quote to the effect that it was bad that no-one was even stealing the music. But that could easily be confused with something else, or I might just be imagining the whole thing.

I wish he'd been around longer; his Doctor was a scared war survivor, the sole survivor, and it showed again and again. He didn't flinch when death struck before his eyes, but he couldn't bring himself to commit more genocides, or let unnecessary deaths go on, and he was never cruel. 

I thought that everything about him was amazingly motivated; the manic smile and passion used to keep the darkness in the back of his mind. The anger and power is what slips through when he can't keep that darkness back. I felt like 10 was manic at strange times, although I still find that he's amazing. 11 I feel is a masterfully rendered old man, acting like a child with his two best friends. But 9...so good, so solid, and too short-lived.

I loved Dalek, because it showed a side of the Doctor that NO other Doctor has been able to capture since. A wild, angry, vengeful man nearly (but not ultimately) willing to step over the edge he's been clinging to. The Empty Child is amazing purely for the end: 'Everybody lives Rose! Just this once! Everybody lives!' The joy that he shows is almost heartbreaking, when you realize what events this regeneration has witnessed that has led to so much death. And finally, the finale. He makes the ultimate decision to pull himself back to the light when he has the option to destroy the Daleks with the humans as casualties of the last act of the Time War. He is unwilling to commit double-genocide again. He dies saving Rose, a last act of selflessness. And his last words, where though he is obviously scared to die, to move on, you sense that he's glad that he can put the darkness to rest.

http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/5927937/#squad-player


Subs: Oscar, Ramires, Luiz, Moses, Torres, Turnbull.

A 3-4-3/5-4-1 with wingbacks. I feel that this would be something Conte would attempt, should he come to us, since he has been using a 3 man defense so well at Juve.


Use Ramires for Lampard, Luiz for Mikel, Moses for Hazard if we need more directness and wingplay, and Oscar for Mata to rotate the midfield. Bertrand can stand in for Cole while Paulo/Ivanovic can do the job at the right back when need be.

When on possession, Mikel drops back to help the defense, while Cole and Azpi push up to provide width. Mata and Hazard can drift into the center like they tend to do now and switch places while on attack, since that's when they are at their creative best. 

When on the defense, Mikel moves up to perform his ball winner/midfield destroyer role, while the Cole and Azpi drop back to form a back five. Mata and Hazard drop to midfield and Ba stays the lone man up front to form a 5-4-1. Terry will have a limited defender role and get additional protection since he is getting old.

This will also work nicely when Lukaku comes back next year and we sell Torres. And if we buy Fellaini, he will move into where Lampard is slotted right now, and provide a more physical presence in our midfield, protecting our little Matas and Hazards from being bullied. Maceachran can be groomed into the Lampard's deep lying playmaker role too, provided he hits the gym and drinks a lot of protein shakes.

We may need more cover at the Center back though, but Luiz and Ivanovic provide us the versatility since they can play both CB and CDM\RB respectively. 

This means HazMatCar will never happen, but it has proven to be nothing more than a gimmick, and we have been very weak defensively when these 3 have been on the pitch at the same time.

But pretty much all towns have a market of some sort, including the shitty concrete towns that look like they are from 1984. So what are you REALLY looking for? ",0,1361090213,null,0,1361090549,0,c8glsx5,t3_18onk1,t1_c8glsx5,t3_18onk1,null,1435583245,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,NervousEnergy,eng-yorkshire,Welshman in Yorkshire,"It seems what you're really after is more of an idea of little-England than anything that exists in the real world.... 

If it helps, your pictures show in order the City of York (which, as I live there, does have all the qualities you described: as well as nasty traffic jams, crime and rundown council housing, and boarded up shops). Then Chester: which has a gorgeous city centre and fairly horrible suburbs. St. Ives is a historic seaside town. The next photo is probably somewhere rural on the Thames river. Then you have Oxford; which is chock-full of old buildings and is very vibrant (and has all the usual problems) considering the massive University population. Then Tewkesbury, which I've never been to, and then somewhere in Hampshire.

Some other places I personally love: 

Norwich has a permanent market in the city centre and lots of shops, including an independent shop district. It's pretty vibrant, and has nice old buildings, a uniquely shaped castle, and a cathedral. 

Lincoln, up by the cathedral at least, is very pretty and has winding cobbled streets with old streetlamps. 
In fact, Lincolnshire has a few nice towns that I have visited, including Market Deeping, Boston, and Stamford, which seem to have the qualities you want. 

Cambridge is basically the sister to Oxford and is pretty and vibrant.

Another university town is Bath, which is famous for the Bath-stone used in the building construction. 

Oop North, we have Durham which is nestled in a river valley, and Harrogate is a historic spa town. Settle borders the Yorkshire Dales National Park and has a very strong community-feel. 

Down in the Peak District: Bakewell (of Bakewell tart fame), Buxton (of Buxton water fame), and Leek are market towns which are on some fantastic terrain, but I think the type of architecture isn't really what you are looking for: it's all a bit black and dark. 

Shrewsbury has a really great town hall and lots of hilly cobbled areas and parks. 

I was born in Brecon, and its a pretty classic mid-Wales market town, with the mountains right on your doorstep. 

But all these places have their own sets of problems too, and I think you might be falling into the trap of looking at Britain through rose-tinted spectacles.

It's usually about an inch across including legs, but sometimes you see one that's two inches across, and you think 'bloody hell, that's a big 'un!' These guys like your bath too, and seem unaware that a plughole is a silly place to live...

We've also got a kinda smooth one with a massive arse but smaller legs that lives outside mostly. Light brown with yellowy bits. Goes nuts if you blow on it and bounces up and down in its web, and will get upset if you put bits of leaf in it's web, so it'll go and cut them out. 

There are the tiny tiny ones that people call money spiders for some reason. (There's some kind of folklore that if you let it walk all over your hand then you'll get money, but I don't think that that is a very sound fiscal policy.) Their speciality is travelling by blowing in the wind, Dylan stylee. This means that you often find them landing on your fucking face on a nice autumn day when you least expect it. They are not dangerous, but you still flail at your face like an idiot for a moment or two. These guys are normally black, but my friend swears he saw a red one once.

We've also got a little black one with white bits that looks really harmless, and is only an eighth of an inch or so across, but this little bugger likes to give you a heart attack. He lulls you into a false sense of security but can jump like a bastard. You'll be a foot or two away and having a look and BAM! he's either on your face or he's disappeared. Sneaky, sneaky little fuck.

We've also got a couple of them with bodies the size of a grain of wheat, but really long, really spindly legs. They kind of skitter everywhere. People call these 'daddy long legs', or 'harvestmen' but no one is actually sure if they are spiders, insects or the same thing. We also have a similar looking flying thing with long flappy wings that gets called the same thing, but is definitely an insect, but is remarkably annoying.

That's about it. There are some tiny red things that run around on bricks and pavements on hot days and squish remarkably satisfyingly, but I don't think they are spiders.

Hope that helps!

First is Tegenaria duellica. Then Araneus diadematus - normally only seen in the autumn. The money spiders are mostly linyphiidae of various species, they are black but there is indeed a reddish one that is very common, Robertus lividus. 

I'm not sure about ""a little brown one with whistle bits"" but it could be a jumping spider from its description. By far the most common jumping spider is Salticus scenicus but that is very much black and white, not brown. A brown jumping spider that's commonish is Euophrys frontalis but it's not the sort of thing you'd see every day.

Lastly we have Pholcus phalangioides which is very common in houses in the southern parts of the UK. 

And the passing reference to the red spider mite correctly points out that it isn't a spider. You've got me on the proper name though, best ask an acarologist. 

I'd also add a candidate off my own for southern areas, Steatoda nobilis. It can bite, unlike all the others, but with only minor effect and it hardly ever does.

Wednesday there is a market in the town of [Knaresborough](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knaresborough). I used to live there a few years ago, it is a nice place.

Thursday the market moves to Ripon, where there is a cathedral, town crier etc.

Fridays i think it is Skipton that has the market.

Then on Saturday it is Skipton again, and also Otley iirc. Otley is a strange place.

All these places have seen money used to increase tourism / improve facilities for visitors.

Ripon is probably my favourite one amongst these, but it is a real shit tip at night sometimes unless you enjoy fighting and chavs. Knaresborough used to be much the same, lots of drugs - not sure if it is any better nowadays.

Otley and Skipton markets used to have some cool stalls with army surplus stuff, music and paraphernalia whilst Ripon and Knaresborough used to be mainly produce and clothing.

The idea of a single family surname passed down from father to both male and female children, and which is given to a man's wife, is a relatively recent western European concept. In most other cultures that isn't how it works.

Edit: I [found a link](http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Pakistani-name) that gives a bit more information. Note that traditionally, married Pakistani women don't actually have a surname -- but of course if they live in the UK the census form requires a surname to be entered, so it will be put down as ""Begum"" meaning (roughly) ""respectable wife"".

true,thatstevelord,cnty-england,AmazingBlazingBasingstoke,"&gt; I'm curios as to why you think the ""debt on the table"" is the responsibility of the Banks.

Perhaps my statement about the banks getting away with it is unclear. The banks required a bailout in order to survive, when they should've been (under standard keynesian economics) allowed to fail. The recapitalisation by the government shifted debt from the banks' insolvency into public debt to be paid off mostly through bonds and taxpayers.

&gt; I can assure you that the majority of blame lies solely upon people taking out debt that they cold not afford to pay back, for fripperies and luxuries that they did not need.

Actually it was the relaxing of regulations that allowed the merger of wholesale and high street banking that caused much of the problems, as high risk trading on derivatives could be backed by a more solid bank. If you really want to sum things up, it was repackaging of debt as currency and the sale not just of the debt, but on things derivative of the debt that allowed the volumes of money involved to exceed the world's economy, and when that bubble burst it triggered a cascade down through the system that hit the retail arms of the then non-segregated bank functions. If the wholesale trading banks were split, then them going bust would've affected things like pensions and insurers and we'd still be in the shit but people would still be able to get mortgages and loans. Having the two on the same balance sheet meant that having one go under would take out the other.

But as someone who worked in a bank and dealt with credit based products I'd expect you to know that.",0,1361101581,null,0,false,0,c8gmxl4,t3_18muj9,t1_c8gmxl4,t1_c8gdx0o,null,1431318791,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

The rest didn't like him as they were sick of Tory rule.  He presided over a time when the Tory party were falling apart and destroying them selves with scandal.  Disliked by much of his own party and his party disliked by much of the country he was on a hiding to nothing.  Same for Brown to some degree. 
But in 1992 he got relected so it was the his last term that was his undoing.  And he was a part of the sleeze that was turning the nation against politicians having an affair with Currie. 
I am not surprised about Cameron.  To centrist for much of his own party, leader ""the nasty party"" to many others, I doubt any prime minister who had to make cuts would be loved.  I personally don't like him as a leader although I think he is probably a good guy.  
Post Blair every one thinks that the PMs role is to be an everyman, hey call me Tony.  We end up with experts in sound bites and quips at the dispatch box but they don't earn our respect.  And if I look across the house at Milliband I see the race to the bottom.  Rather than trying to out do the incumbent with strong policies and leadership we have another who thinks that every public outing should include a poor joke and a dig at the opposition. 
I'm a bit too young to remember Callaghan, I was 10 in '79 but I do remember the winter of discontent and the general feel of the last years of the 70s seemed that of a tired country wanting something new, although that may be massively effected by my learnings since that time.  But I don't remember it being a nice place and I do remember the change in the 80s to a new optimism, although I was anti Thatcher I can now see that many of the things that were done needed to happen to turn the country around.

I'm sure GFH are interested in the maturation of our young guns like Byram and White, maybe even Poleon (don't know very much about him)
and according to [transfermakt.com](http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/en/southampton-fc/altersschnitt/verein_180_2012.html) Southhamptons average fielded age was between 23 and 26 this year and was between 23 and 28 last year. On the other side of that, our average age this year has been between [25.75 and 29](http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/en/leeds-united/altersschnitt/verein_399_2012.html) and if you change the year to last year you'll see that Grayson's average lineup was on the low end, and Warnock's were always on the high end.

I doubt though that we'll get Adkins in now, or before the end of the season.

Another interesting country w.r.t. surnames is Iceland, where people still don't actually have surnames other than the traditional Nordic patronymic. So take for example the singer Bjork, her full name is indeed just ""Bjork"". To distinguish her from other Bjorks in Iceland she might sometimes call herself ""Bjork Gudmundsdottir"" but that means, quite literally, ""Bjork, Gudmund's daughter"", because her father's name is Gudmund. I don't know if she has a brother, but if she did and he was called ""Erik"" he would then call himself ""Erik Gudmundsson"" -- ""Erik, Gudmund's son"".

Did the labour government cripple America and France an Gemany and Holland too? Because they all suffered from exactly the same recession. The world economies are highly interconnected, just as when the credit crunch happened in america it affected all of us. We can't export if no one is buying and when recessions and depressions are global, everyones economy slows down.  The world didn't exit that period until the mid 1980s when the OPEC countries overproduced as the oil price dropped. 

Just like the last labour government didn't ruin the economy, we are in a global recession. 

The previous government created PFI contracts to build hospitals and schools, but this government have set the NHS on a path where it now has to compete with organisations that can afford make a loss on their services for a few years until the NHS is starved of funds and trusts start failing. These private companies are going to take the profitable work and leave the rest for the NHS. The Tories have slit the throat of the NHS and now it is bleeding out. It won't exist within twenty years. It's gone and you can thank smarmy Dave for that.

Edit: Whoah, apparently pointing out a false argument is unpopular. Maybe I'm not 'contributing to the discussion'.

She in these days is an easy scapegoat and hate bandwagon people can jump on without understanding complex issues of Economics, History and Politics. 

To her credit, she was an outstanding leader, not in the sense she held head office but in charismatic ability and rhetoric. She was someone who inspired courage and loyalty. Hard to see in contemporary times with all the propaganda levied against her, I make special reference there to **propaganda** because she does have massive failings which I will go into in the next paragraph, but these should be adressed in a clear, unbiased manner which I often find lacking in the emotionally fueled  ""poor us, proletariat"" circlejerk and hate bandwagon she has against her. She was a shrewd diplomat and in many regards to Foreign policy she without a doubt represented Britain in the best way possible, as evidenced by her negotiation of the UK EU Rebate, and the Falklands Islands war in which she wrangled use of US military bases as a staging point for naval projection onto the islands. 

However, it does have to be said that in catastrophic regards she did not have a clear follow-through plan after her privatization plans as evidenced with the high structural unemployment that followed her tenure. She merely fixed the problems that Britain was going through at the beginning of the 80's but she did not repair the damage that said fixing would cause. This is what she should be criticised for, and it is what I *do* criticise her for, I do not parade around thinking that her and the Conservative party of that era can do no wrong and it is vengeful workers who propagate misinformation about her. 

Every leader has things that they did right and wrong, even dictators. But in recent British history, in my opinion, Thatcher is a much maligned, propagandised and emotionally charged subject that sometimes it is hard to see through the bullshit.

The main problem with this is rights.  The BBC doesn't own the rights to the music used in their programmes, so any programme with non-public domain music in it (a lot) can't be used like this.  Similarly, there are things like having clips from non-BBC produced stuff, in things like documentaries and reviews. Similarly again, photos are difficult to clear (for things like QI, etc.).

Additionally, the BBC use independent production companies to produce a lot of their stuff nowadays (which is a good thing as it supports the creative industries in this country). They like to be able to commercialise what they've made after the BBC has aired it, etc. (a lot of the time with the help of BBC Worldwide, so some of that money goes back to the Beeb).  They also co-produce a lot of stuff with international broadcasters - HBO, Discovery, other public broadcasters around the world - who have a similar view. Things like Planet Earth, Parade's End, etc.

Judges must apply the law, otherwise their decisions will (successfully) be appealed. Part of the law they must apply in these cases is the Human Rights Act 1998.

If the government really wants to change the way judges decide these cases, they need to legislate. As soon as they do, the judges will apply the changes. But until they do, the judges will have to apply the current legislation (which was passed by parliament, and can only be repealed by parliament).

But passing parliamentary motions and giving press interviews will not and cannot affect the way judges apply the law.

* Oscar was incredible today. Easily our best player. He's certainly improving. 

* Rafa actually made a good substitution - i.e at the right time. I might have liked to see Torres come on for a bit because Ba wasn't brilliant today - but then again we do need him for Thursday.

* It was great to see RA smiling to himself after Lampard scored his 199th goal. Please let that be hinting at something?


Let's hope for a full match of that second half performance on Thursday!

If you really have empathy, try empathising with the family of the young boy who was killed.

Can you understand their pain? Can you understand why some people would have very good reason to want harm to come to Venables?

Here's the thing. Justice isn't fair, it can't be fair unless we institute a total eye for an eye policy (which is obviously a bad idea).

The victims of crime will nearly always come out on the bottom of the pile in any particular case. The family of the deceased will never get their relative back, the rape victim will never be un-raped.

Justice should be blind and neutral (and rightly so), judgements should be based on logic and what is the best for society as a whole. But at the same time you have to empathise with the victims who will never fully recover and who have to live with the effects of crime for the rest of their lives.

&gt; Imagine trying to get on with your life. Trying to live with what you did. And then everyone knows who you are and what you did. Whats the point in living when all you will receive is hate.

true,pikeybastard,null,null,"He was the most powerful chancellor in history, operating almost as co-pm with Blair on most domestic policy. There's an in joke in the civil service, which was  there being a 'case of the TB-GB's' whenever no.s 10 and 11 tried to involve themselves in the inner workings of another department. Many ministers were Brown loyalists, following his policy line rather than Blairs, which was the main reason for Blair's constant reshuffling of cabinet- he needed the Brownites to govern, but knew that to achieve his agenda couldn't allow them too long in any one post. 

As a chancellor he inherited an economy with strong long term growth, well balanced and with a euro opt-out. Unfortunately like many he subscribed to the doctrine of the third way, which was to deregulate and unfetter the financial system and big business in the hope that the boom would fund big public sector spending, which worked for as long as credit was elastic. However in a boom it's easy to look good, as Ken Clarke once said, the test of an economy is in straitened times, and Brown left the economy in a huge hole for 2008. Economic growth was not born of high labour productivity, high value opportunities, high production or exports, but a property and credit bubble. That's why the UK economy crashed so hard in 2007/2008, and is largely still flatlining. Our manufacturing base shrunk from over 22% of the economy to 11% between97 and 2010- 3 times the fall from 79-96. Our exports were stagnant. The structural mistakes made are shown by the current economy, where there is record employment but low productivity per man hour, lower than the rest of Europe. As a PM he harshly reaped Blair's hangover, but also his own, and largely was the architect of the division within his party that led to his downfall, bringing in the Blairites (eg Mandelson, who is a sociopath but also a genius) when it was too late.

I know this will likely be downvoted as Brown seems very popular on Reddit (maybe he isn't, but it seems so), and this is understandable- Osborne is such a super-colossal shitbag, and people in hard times develop very short memories. But he really was one of the most damaging politicians of the modern age; the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and he inherited the strongest hand ever passed on to a uk government, and passed on arguably the weakest.

Firstly Margret Thatcher was Prime Minister, not President.

Secondly there was an oil crisis before Margret Thatchers leadership, and this lead to the inflation and resulting interest rates you saw during her leadership. 

Things aren't instant. The economic cycle takes some 40 years to run.

Also you're well aware what happened in 1992, the interest rate didn't magically jump, we were kicked out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). This isn't something that can happen again, and so I didn't include it in the list of things that can cause the interest rate to rise above 8%.

Absolutely.

Each of these keeps only some of the basic elements of a mob football match (scrumming, throwing, kicking, dribbling, tackling, and set pieces like throw-ins) and they've all formalised and legislated them away from the barbarity they used to be.

And it was mob football that was [made illegal](http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2007/feb/07/theknowledge.sport), not anything prissy like the modern codes. Really mob football is probably still illegal: it'd just be called ""affray"" or ""riot"" now.

Much as the practitioners of each of the modern codes likes to think of theirs as ""real football"" (and the others as wrongheaded softie business), truly if no-one is getting hit in the face with a shovel, it's not really football.
