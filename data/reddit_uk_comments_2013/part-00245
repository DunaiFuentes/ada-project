Yeah it's weird that tabs on paper are just fucking banal,boring instructions but you play a certain lick or riff enough and you sort of adopt or inherit the mentality of the dude that played it if you practise it enough?

I know it sounds mental, but i still literally pore over mark knopfler's sultans of swing...and I've been playing the same licks and trcks for like a decade but I still have shit to learn, like the personality of a guitar solo is so indescribable and amazing. I'll never be good enough to fucking rock off my own shit, but it sure feels good emulating hendrix, clapton or whomever.

p.s. [The track that I guitar'd the most on and spent years studying.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCJCQiWxxc)

e2a: sorry, I'm in cups so am gonna explicitly describe this piece of music for the benefit of nobody but me, sorry to shit up your post wth my self-centredness, but this is something I need to do......

That first riff is gob-smacking

Then Jimi plays on the E (more, later)....then the stacatto when reflecting the vocals when it represents an A chord,.,,

Then in the break bit before the verse it plays the riff that makes the song, it's so outspoken, so direct and so lyrical! who needs a bloke sing8ng the words, when the guitar weeps the same song....

Sorry, this is bad analysis, and I know [jimi's version](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiBF_hJ3sSE) was much less dramatic. But I think this is the archetype of mastery of a guitar.

He never knew how fucking amazing he was, he was a teenage guitar4 player, he had no idea that he would he would literally 'level up' our understranduing of music, and our appreciation of it,......

Nobody born after Jimi can understand a universe that used to exist before jimi changed the fucking world.

RIP Never forget.

There are others that will pay people to browse a given website for 30-60 seconds or click on a video so it registers a view triggering ad revenue in exchange for a few pennies. Do it enough and supposedly you can make £20 or so in a few hours. Over at /r/beermoney they do a fair bit of it.

true,notnotcitricsquid,null,null,"A credit score is a fictional number generated by a company based on what they believe is desirable. The score you're given by Experian for example is not the score that Natwest would have when you apply for a loan. Every lender has their own criteria that they judge people on, some lenders put much higher value on low credit utlisation while others put the most value on the number of accounts that you have open. Your credit report is a good way to understand where you stand (the credit you have, your utilisation, what lenders will see, how many applications you've made) but the scores are complete fiction that you should ignore.

The most important thing is that you do not default on anything, that you exist on the electoral register and you have low credit utilisation. Although you can do things to improve your attractiveness to lenders, on the whole you'll gain the most from keeping yourself in the black.

The best way to use a credit card to improve your credit rating is to spend ~25% of the limit every month (instead of using cash) and then pay that off at the end of the month, that way you're showing that you're able to regularly pay off your responsibilities and that you're not using all of your available credit, which would show you're not very good at managing money. Your ultimate goal is to demonstrate you're reliable, stable and not desperate.

If you don't need a credit card at the moment and you're just thinking about the long term, focus on making sure that you're utilising as little credit as possible (keep out of your overdraft; pay off your credit card every month) and that will be more than enough to show that you're a responsible adult. Mortgage companies are not *that* picky, just as long as you can afford the mortgage and don't have a negative history, so don't panic about small things like day to day spending, as long as on the whole you're not in necessary debt or defaulting on debts...

The best solution (probably, imo) would be to give more power to the Westminster government and to remove some from us, but the downside to that is many people would feel like it was a regression and not progess for NI. In reality I think we're going to have to simply suffer for the next 50~ years until we start getting politicians who don't give a flying fuck about religions/point scoring on prodestant/catholic issues (stuff like catholics wanting things translated to Irish and then protestants wanting things translated to Ulster Scotts). 

What really scares me about our government is the fact that Sinn Fein are a league apart in politics from the DUP, they're just much better at appearing rational and generally looking good. The reason that scares me is because I personally don't want a united Ireland (despite associating myself with being Irish and not British).

Ok, let's put this on pause and buy myself the time for this extremely long term plan to be able to develop.  Not sure what it is yet.  Sure I will by the time it comes up though.

My assumption is that, similar to Amy's recreation of the universe, the state of the universe will sustain itself, to include their memories of it occurring in their own personal time lines, keeping them in existence, but the event will no longer be part of the time line they have access to, like a five minute skip in a movie where the rest of it continues along but you can't access within that messed up part.

&gt; Dr Pepper was introduced to the Australian market in 1997 with a short-lived TV advertising campaign and low-priced 280-ml cans sold through supermarkets. Dr Pepper was subsequently sold in 1.25-litre plastic bottles alongside other major brands until 2003. Cadbury Schweppes stated the product did not gain acceptance by Australians, whose detractors complained that the drink tasted like ""cough syrup""[citation needed] (a tag also given to sarsaparilla). A report on the soft drink industry by IBIS accused Cadbury Schweppes of failing in their marketing of the brand, given its global appeal. It is probable that the major problem with the marketing campaign was in advertising it as ""American"". The use of the Statue of Liberty moving to Australia and passing cans of Dr Pepper on to two Australian males made its imported (i.e. ""non-Australian"") status clear.
After withdrawing from the Australian market, Dr Pepper arrived without fanfare in New Zealand.

true,Lozzy1256,null,null,"Honestly you don't need to worry about this. Your credit score is poor because you've not proved yourself yet. Getting a new credit card will put your score down a fair amount if your score is already based on sparse information, which it will be because of your age. It will take 6 months to a year of good history building, and in this time your card will age, your limit on your card will probably go up if you prove you can pay your debs, and the credit card will stop being new, all of which will make your score stronger than ever before.

I'm not a big fan of premium bonds, personally. The return on them is atrocious! You're much better off getting that money into a high interest (tax free!) ISA. If you have more than (I think it's) £5500 saved, you'll probably have to split your money between a normal ISA (which I personally think is the better one) and a stocks and shares ISA (which is a little bit more risky IMO). You can save up to £1100 (ish, I've not checked the figures in a while!) every year and any return you get (interest) is tax free, it's a pretty sweet deal. After you've had your ISA for one year make sure to shop around and transfer to a better one, since your rate will most likely be an introductory rate for one year!

As for the overdraft, I really wouldn't worry about reducing the limit. That counts as credit available to you, and you want to be able to have that in case of an emergency. As a student who is away from home, it's absolutely vital to have some money available to you which in your case will be interest free in case of an emergency! If something happens at home and you need to get there RIGHT NOW, it's going to be great to have a spare £600 interest free that you can use to pay for overpriced train fares/buses/flights. Obviously it's ideal if you can not use that money, but it also helps with your credit score. The fact that the bank has given you this line of credit does make your credit score better.

In terms of credit card usage, try to use your card every month for one thing. I normally use it to buy petrol and occasionally a big shop, if I've not been driving much (or have persuaded the fiance its his turn to fill up the car!). I phoned the bank when I got the card and arranged to have it paid off in full automatically when it was due, out of my current account, and most banks will have the option for you to set this up. It's super easy if you're credit card and current account are with the same bank, but it's totally do-able if they're not. Just make sure that you're using the card for one thing every month, and you're not utilising all of the available credit on it. 

So to summarise; use your overdraft to pay for emergencies, it's interest free so if you can't scrape the money together to pay it off by the end of the following month then you don't need to worry. Use your credit card for one or two food shops every month, and set it up with your card provider for it to be automatically paid off at the due date from your current account. Keep at it! Your accounts are new because you're young. You aren't (it seems to me) in a financial position to buy a house any time soon, so don't worry about it too much. Make basic steps to build up your credit (like you're doing) and enjoy being a student. Make the most of the opportunities available to you!

(N.B. Don't take out another credit card until this one has stopped being new! I'd recommend at least a year before getting another credit card, but even that might be a touch too soon!)",0,1384677874,null,0,false,0,cdg9o7r,t3_1qsfvt,t1_cdg9o7r,t3_1qsfvt,null,1428625920,7,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,7

Downside: It stops working above a certain altitude. This wasn't a problem for me as I only cared when it was on the ground, really. The bit in between was a Raspberry Pi. The GPS receiver and mobile were plugged in to the USB port of the Pi, and the Pi read the GPS info, wrote a text to the mobile and sent it every thirty seconds.

Thanks for asking, it allowed me to refresh and update my understanding on this (last I read about this was a good 5-10 years ago)

&gt;You will quite often hear that women who started having sex young or women who have a lot of different sex partners are more likely to get cervical cancer. But really, this is only true because the earlier you start having sex and the more men you have sex with, the more likely you are to pick up an infection with a high risk (cancer causing) human papilloma virus (HPV). And so then you are more at risk of developing cervical cancer.

&gt;It is not correct to say that women who get cervical cancer have it because they were promiscuous (slept around). After all, you could have only slept with one man and still caught the virus if he had it. If he's had lots of partners, that will increase your risk, because it indirectly exposes you to possible sexual infections from lots of other people.

&gt;Health education may help women reduce their exposure to HPV and so reduce the risk of cervical cancer. Some studies have shown that teaching women about healthy sexual behaviour, such as using condoms, avoiding sex when they are young, learning how to talk to their partner about safe sex and reducing the number of sexual partners, can help them behave in ways that may lower their cervical cancer risk.

So unless the Gov and Schools are willing to VASTLY enhance the quality of Sex Education for teenagers, this information risks being lost.

That's great to know, thanks.

Hah, yeah, it's hard enough guessing what the rules changes will be for tax &amp; allowances over the next few years, let alone 30. Still, hopefully there will be some sensible system in place.

&gt; When you die, the money you purchased your annuity with had gone (unless you have a guaranteed period or spouse's pension).

It's rather an unusual thing, betting on your own lifespan. I suppose by saving for retirement I'm kind of doing the same thing.

&gt; The fund value of the Income Drawdown is taxed around 55% and paid to your estate.

That's good to know. I think when I ran the numbers it looked like I'd be able to retire with more money than I currently spend, so splitting it and having some inheritable would be nice.

Do you have to be so rude?

You shouldn't be stealing office stationary, but it is hardly as important to people's lives and well-being if stationary was to run out compared to drugs. No matter how powerful the drugs, running out of them unexpectedly due to employee misconduct can have much greater ramifications than running out of paper.

&gt; One of medicines she took was Ibrufen,

So you pick out a relatively harmless drug of the stolen ones and say ""look she only stole something that wasn't worth that much."" These medicines she stole are not exactly the focus, but it is entirely unacceptable for a nurse to be stealing medication, regardless of how much it costs, how potent it is, or how common it is.

Whether it is common practice to steal drugs from hospital is another matter, what this does do is bring into question her character. It certainly doesn't make her a competent health care professional.

&gt; Wrong. They didn't find the medicine until after they'd arrested her.

So they arrested her for the fun of it?

&gt; For six weeks, on just a fingerprint!?

I don't pretend to know all of the evidence they held, nor should you. As far as we know she was held under reasonable suspicion based on the evidence available, unless a report is released showing this not to be the case. A fingerprint is not really going to be the only evidence, there will be other factors that you refuse to consider.

Of course, if you feel the police were overzealous with their attempts to convict her and only had very flimsy evidence then your beef is with the police investigation, not with the laws being enforced.

&gt; You mean should they not consider the multiple statements and testimonies of people close to the suspect but without bias?

How people perceive a person in no way overrides the evidence against them. Their personality is often taken into consideration when determining guilt, but it is not anywhere near as valuable as hard evidence.

&gt; Please, don't join the police force, just stick to making fuck-wit comments on Reddit, it's safer for us all that way!

How does this even relate to anything? This person was a suspect in a case, was held as a result of being a suspect for a time (maybe it was too long, don't know enough to judge). This is entirely standard procedure. What you are asking for is exceptional treatment, which is not reasonable.

Does it suck she was detained and later found innocent? Yes, obviously.

I understand you love the guy (his footballing no homo pun intended) but others have diff opinions. Your opinion is not above the rest. I have seen him play when he was in Atletico and when he plays for Colombia he is a great player no doubt. For me Cristiano is not better than Messi they're on the same pahe when it comes to dominating but I'll give the edge to Cristiano because wherever he has played he has dominated.  Whether it was in the Portuguese First division or the Premier League or the National Team or especially La Liga Cristiano has shined brilliantly.  
It is harder to play in the Premier League no questions asked. Its a more physical style of play than La Liga I know Messi is one of the Best players to have ever played the sport I just want to see him play in england. I can guarantee you he wont accomplish 90 goals a year ever if he were to play there as you see from Cristianos stats in england he scored what 80 something goals in over 150 appearances with Man U and in la liga with Madrid he has scored 130 something goals in 120 something games? Yet u don't want to say its not harder to play in the EPL? 
Before you respond let me remind you so u wont go off the deep end

Volunteer applications
The DBS definition of a volunteer is defined in the Police Act 1997 (criminal records) Regulations 2002 as:

“Any person engaged in an activity which involves spending, unpaid (except for travel and other approved out-of-pocket expenses), doing something which aims to benefit some third party and not a close relative.”

To qualify for a free-of-charge criminal record check, the applicant must not benefit directly from the position the DBS application is being submitted for. The applicant must not:

benefit directly from the position for which the DBS application is being submitted
receive any payment (except for travel and other approved out-of-pocket expenses)
be on a work placement
be on a course that requires them to do this job role
be in a trainee position that will lead to a full time role/qualification

It states on the DBS application form ‘By placing a cross in the yes box (at section 68) you confirm that the post meets the DBS definition for a free-of-charge volunteer application. Please note that DBS may recover the application fee if box 68 is marked in error and this could result in the cancellation of your DBS registration’.

true,DiscoPopShop,null,null,"I think he will most definitely start Lamela on the right. After his performance in his last game, he was in my eyes and I'm sure in AVB's eyes too, ready for the Premier League. The issue is, Townsend at that point could not be dropped. He hadn't done anything wrong, and dropping him would be unfair. He didn't play his best last game and he knows that, so he'll have to accept being benched for a game (although it is against City). And its now Lamela's opportunity to grab.

After the right wing, the left wing picks itself. I'm not sure on Chadli's status, but Lennon or Siggy could be played  (also Townsend but I'm not a big believer in that). Playing both Lamela and Lennon would be far too aggressive in a game against the best attacking side in the league, especially as a lot of their prowess is in the wings (with Navas being the traditional type winger and Silva and Nasri drifting infield having at least one of the wings protected with a slightly more defensive winger who can track runs and make tackles is vital). That leaves out Siggy as the standout choice to me, unless he goes for the surprise of Holtby on the left which I doubt he will. 

In midfield I think he'll start Sandro and Paulinho, Soldado up front and Walker - Dawson - Chiriches/Kaboul - Vertonghen as the back line. Not sure if Lloris can play, but if he can he will.

It is logical that the higher earners pay more, after all they earn a hell of lot more.

But you know what would help reduce the tax burden on the higher earners who actually pay tax? getting the higher earners who employ 'tax avoidance' schemes to prevent paying their share of the tax burden.

true,withabeard,,Pint of best - with a top if it's hot.,"So to set it out. I'm someone who doesn't describe themselves as a dare devil. Yet, I ride motorbikes, I climb regularly, I mountain bike and I'm looking to get more into skydiving this year. None of these activities need to be dangerous. But to be safe you need to be constantly learning about them.

When I go to different climbing walls/gyms I tend to watch what other people are up to. Sometimes it can be a great way to learn new techniques. Not just for climbing itself, but sometimes for belaying (the guy on the ground controlling the rope to stop the climber becoming pavement pizza). There are lots of different devices and techniques for belaying, some better (more bomb proof) than others.

When you've got a mountaineering group or something, these are often people who have been climbing for 40+ years are are all still alive. For some, this is skill. They have been learning new techniques in that time, improving and looking after themselves. For others, and sadly the majority, it's luck. They're lucky they've not had an accident yet.

So as an example, all belay devices on the market at the minute require you to hold the ""brake line"" when belaying. It's a little hard to explain through text, but basically you hold that rope and the belay device engages stopping the rope feeding out and your climber dropping. There are some devices that assist you and mean less of the onus is on you. These devices almost always will hold the rope for you. Lots of people become complacent with this ""it's worked every time for me"" and so they get into letting go of the rope at times and try to fob you off that it'll be fine. Mostly it is, sometimes it isn't.

Belaying on the whole is a hard thing to master. Sometimes the difference between the climber just falling off and the climber dropping to the floor, is how you're standing. Many people who learn through friends don't get taught the difference. Then they teach other friends. At this point, the knowledge is lost completely. The best way to learn is through recognised courses at the gym.

Another example, free soloing. Climbing &gt;30' without a rope. Some people see this as the ultimate expression of a climber. The raw ability etc. Some people then seem to think as long as the route is easy ""you'll be fine"" you can do that climb. Well yes, maybe you can. But what if the rock breaks? What if part of the ""easy"" route has fallen off and is now a hard route.

However, get it all right each time. And it doesn't have to be a dangerous sport at all.

It is not certain that your qualification would be accepted b the UK registration authority www.hpc-uk.org for info. You might want to contact the IBMS as well for advice www.ibms.org.uk

UK NHS scientific services are currently in turmoil. Very few jobs are being advertised (the UK professional journal (IBMS) seems to have between zero and three jobs per month. Ten years ago there were maybe 10-15 pages of jobs! This is because the NHS scientific services are being privatised by stealth; centralised into mega-laboratories; and posts down-graded into unqualified positions in order to save money.

Assuming that you will need to 'top up' your qualification to get UK registration - you are most unlikely to find a UK hospital to take you on in a trainee position, and in any case it would be a band 3 or 4 pay post - which is barely above a living wage IMO for most of the UK.

- Jackson Lake's 'Sonic Screwdriver'- I hadn't even thought of that one...next time I'm at a hardware store though...
- The Sonic Cane- I'm in the process of putting the parts I'll need together to make it, I'm a theatre technician and I have the skills necessary to make a few things so...
- River's Alpha Meazon Pistol- in process, the project has kind of stalled, but once I settle into a work schedule I'll pick it up again (I'll post images of my progress and final product once it's finished)
- Jack/River's Sonic Blaster- It is almost impossible to find/buy and the one place I did find it, it cost about $500...so a bit cost prohibitive.  However I do want to make one, because I find that type of thing fun, however some of the parts need to be crafted with things that I don't have easy access too.
- Sarah Jane's Sonic Lipstick- I may make it eventually, we'll see
- 8's screwdriver(s)- I've never seen it as any different than 5-7's screwdriver, although with the new images from ""Night of the Doctor"" I may be getting one and moding it a bit.  As for his screwdriver from the other media (comics, radio, books) It's a very detailed crafting project that I don't really have time nor resources for, but we'll see.  
- ""the first doctor doesn't have a sonic screwdriver""-  yeah, that was a typing error on my part, I meant the 2nd Doctor's screwdriver.  I know it's supposed to be silver, and the button is supposed to be in the middle, but it's a pen flashlight that i had, and it was close enough for me to put it in with the others.

Men who were either forced, or mislead through propaganda into the trenches. World War one is the very definition of a pointless war.

For most things when she's out and about though she just moves things to arms length if she can't see it up close, it doesn't seem too bad. 

At the time, there were two types being offered - I think one involved making an incision (LASIK?) and the other didn't. Either way, one was a bit more expensive but she opted for that. Have a read up about the types, as I don't remember many details, but I think the 'cheaper' option has come along quite a bit since. All the same though, for the sake of a few hundred extra quid when it's involving the quality of your vision for the rest of your life...It wasn't cheap though, I know that. Looking at it, might have been PRK ish? Her prescription was around -4.00 I believe.

The procedure didn't hurt at all/didn't feel anything apparently, but her eyes were sore for a few weeks after. Had lots of eyedrops to put in regularly for a couple of weeks, and some hilarious plastic goggle things strapped to her face to sleep in to stop you rubbing them or irritating in the night (I assume). :D Bit blurry for a few days I think, and she's always said that her vision seemed to peak a few weeks after, rather than right away.

But these are generally not used because errors can be greater, they cost more then a simple tray with a trap door, increased cost to maintain, increased size requirements for machine and increased power use. I would like to add for self service machines you would require a coin sorter to be in the machine first to separate coins going in and a separate one to sort coins going out (if you pay with a tenner) this can lead to the customer getting more change back than they should've and vice versa. 

On those machines notes are sorted into separate cartridges one for £5.00 notes one for £10 and so on (imagine a card sorting machine) to be used as change. Notes put in by the customer typically (though not on all machines) go into a note box (holds many differing notes). A similar thing happens with the coins.

Some machines have a coin/note recycler which sorts what comes in and adds it to the ""bank"" to give change. These are more expensive to maintain.

Nearly all machines sort out coinage though, that is more often than not, done using a belt with holes which runs around a drum and as a coin passes the required hole the coin drops and shoots to its required case.

1). Not really applicable. Just don't go cheap. 

2) my eyes were awful. -9 or something. Same kind of reasoning you have mentioned. I also couldn't wear contacts because my eyes are too convex. 

3) $3000. I also have a lifetime warranty so I can go back for touch ups if I ever need to. 

4) no I've never had to wear glasses again for anything. 20/20 vision. Although for the first year it was difficult to see at night because of some halo issues, but that seems to have subsided. 

5) no I did not take out insurance. Just make sure you go to the right place. I got some good advice: just remember that any consultation you go that you don't pay for is a sales pitch. 

I also had really bad eye sight. Horrible! So I had to get PRK surgery rather than the more popular lasik. It's an older technology, but because my eyes were very bad I had to get that method. I can't remember the reasoning behind it. It hurt, though. Not the procedure, but up until a week after it hurt like he'll and I could barely open my eyes.

The next day I got a quote from the body shop for £110 including vat. I text her and within the hour she brought over the cash, I tell my insurance company to drop the claim. Everyone's happy.
If she never paid up I'd simply let the insurance sort it out. 

Do note tho, The incident remains on record for the next time you renew but my quote didn't get affected by it. I don't know if the woman's quote was higher because of it but my insurance company assured me that it's only logged and is under ""no claim made"". It gets wiped after 3 years (some 5 years)

That makes no sense at all.  You've obviously got no idea what a Ponzi scheme is.  A decentralised ponzi scheme?  If Bitcoin is, then so is every other traded commodity.  Bitcoin investment (if you treat it as such) is zero sum, and who wins is going to come down to the success of the traded item.  That's nothing like a Ponzi.

&gt; The oddest thing is, there's not some grand conspiracy to get people to invest. It's just a bunch of people who want their coins to be worth more, spreading misinformation and distorting the facts of bitcoin.

Spreading misinformation?

&gt; It's nothing like pingit

It's just like pingit; only the unit of transfer is the bitcoin not the pound.

&gt; For example, anyone wondering into /r/bitcoin would think that there's literally no negatives to buying a bitcoin

Yeah; because r/bitcoin is the whole of the bitcoin community.  Every subject-based reddit is a circle jerk.  So what?  If you spent more than five minutes in there you'd also notice that there is a lot of commentary that is sensible -- ""don't put all your money in bitcoin""; ""bitcoin might not be a success"" are regulary comments.

&gt; I've been saying this since February when they started climbing in value and my words are as true now as they were then.

To be honest, given that you've been saying this for so long and the open-endedness of your time scale for failure -- I really can't see what evidence anyone could present that would ever make you think bitcoin isn't a disaster waiting to happen.  Scientific theories are only scientific theories if they are falsifiable -- would you care to give the criteria that you would accept as falsifying your theory?  If not, then it's just your opinion.

&gt; Also, I'm an impartial voice since I don't own bitcoin. Are you?

That doesn't make you impartial.  You've picked a side and you push for it (I know that since anytime I mention the word bitcoin in r/unitedkingdom, you pop up and say exactly the same things) -- worse, now that you've publicly and strongly made this case, you can't back down without losing face.  There are only ""bitcoin owners"" and ""not bitcoin owners"", ""non bitcoin owners"" who have heard of bitcoin and choose not to buy some (which is fine, like you) are just as partial as bitcoin owners.

I'm not suggesting anyone convert all their money to bitcoins.  However, if you'd bought a hundred quid's worth in february, and just left them in your wallet, you'd now have 20 times that amount of value -- a lovely bit of walking about money.  Perfect for just the occasions when you might use pingit, and all you'd have at risk is £100.

It's simple. When I go to a shop I actually use, and it's a payment option. Then I'll admit I was wrong. 

&gt;worse, now that you've publicly and strongly made this case, you can't back down without losing face.

I don't care about losing face when I'm an anonymous person on the internet. I'd happily admit I was wrong if I thought I was at all wrong. 

&gt;However, if you'd bought a hundred quid's worth in february, and just left them in your wallet, you'd now have 20 times that amount of value -- a lovely bit of walking about money.

That's correct, but why are you saying that? You're subtly hinting at future performance based on past performance. That's wrong, imo. You're clearly trying to get people to buy in, even if you're not stating it outright. It's infuriating. 

There were people that bought in at $250 in April then had their investments cut by more than half by May. They bought in on the exact same hype you're displaying. 

The problems I see are:

1) It's a complete fucking ball ache to get money in and out of. 

2) Nowhere useful accepts it. 

3) The places that do decide to accept it generally get very few bitcoin orders. Wordpress recently removed it as a payment option after only taking a 'few hundred dollars' over 6 months. Reddit have said it costs more in accountant hours than it does in saved credit card fees. 

4) Bitcoin is a better marketing tool than it is a currency. You get to spam all bitcoin related forums with your domain name if you start accepting bitcoin. 

There's just better options if you want digital currency. OKpay, for example. I can go to my local newsagents about a 2 minute walk away, give them cash, they give me a code then I can use that code online to redeem for products on ecommerce sites that accept it. 

Completely anonymous, no charge backs, etc. 

Now, as nerd gold I can understand bitcoin. The problem is, its current value is speculation that it will become a widely used currency online. 

I think that'll never happen. I think if everyone just admitted it's more like gold, then the price would become more realistic. 

Basically, it's a commodity which is currently overpriced because people wrongly think it's got a future as a currency.  ",0,1384721237,null,0,1384721493,0,cdgkzkl,t3_1qs3sh,t1_cdgkzkl,t1_cdgkjo3,null,1428620497,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I think you cast the proponents of bitcoin in an unfair light -- we all accept that bitcoin could be zero tomorrow.  If a fundamental flaw in the protocol is found, they will suddenly be worthless. Then we'll all be wrong; manifestly and publicly.

&gt; That's correct, but why are you saying that? You're subtly hinting at future performance based on past performance. That's wrong, imo. You're clearly trying to get people to buy in, even if you're not stating it outright. It's infuriating.

Well I didn't mean to.  I meant that you can, just as you could in Feb, put £100 into bitcoin.  Not your life savings, and you will have walking around money.  As it happens, if you'd done that in Feb, you'd have more than that.  Will it be the same next year?  Who knows, but the point is that people like you were saying it was all going to be a disaster then too.  So far it hasn't been.

&gt; There were people that bought in at $250 in April then had their investments cut by more than half by May. They bought in on the exact same hype you're displaying.

Except those people have now doubled their money.  You're cherry picking your data points -- selecting the absolute peak, and then the subsequent trough.  They are certainly volatile, no question.

&gt; Negative points.

All accepted.  But there are positives too.

&gt; There's just better options if you want digital currency. OKpay, for example.

It's interesting you mention OKPay -- one of the easiest ways to get bitcoins is to deposit into OKPay then use their cash out to bitcoins facility.  It seems odd that you don't think that's difficult, but you do think ""It's a complete fucking ball ache to get money in"" (and out).

There must also be a measure of the cost to *other human beings* of shutting down a major arterial route or public transport network for the sake of just one or two individuals. At what point does their death/problem exceed the suffering of thousands?

To state: ""all deaths or suicide bids are more important than all living people"" is at first glance honourable - but I don't see any of those people rushing over to Africa to do all they can to prevent deaths there.

Gallifreyans were not always known as ""Time-Lords,"" and even in the days of things like *The Deadly Assassin* and *Trial of a Time Lord*, not all Gallifreyans were called that.

The Time Lords are an aristocratic elite to the other Gallifreyans, who are seen as throwbacks to the Dark Times - a time when Gallifrey faced similar conflicts over material wealth and energy supplies as modern Earth.

Rassilon and Omega were contemporaries at the end of the Dark Times, and had elevated cosmic sciences to levels which make our greatest achievements look like little more than cave paintings and pointed sticks.

Among their developments, Rassilon had come up with an idea for harnessing the incredible forces of a black hole for productive, rather than destructive use. It's not clear whether he actually had time travel in mind, or if this was merely an attempt to solve an energy crisis, but based on what we know about how Gallifreyans tend to think, he merely used an energy crisis as an excuse for performing costly and dangerous experiments on a massive scale.

To execute his plan for the black hole, however, it's properties had to be tightly controlled. It had to be in the right place. It had to collapse at the right moment. Its event horizon had to have the right diameter. All of these seemed out of Rassilon's control, and the plan was nearly abandoned as impossible.

Enter Omega, who had independently developed technology capable of exerting just such control over the core of a star. Using his stellar manipulator - the Hand of Omega - he could position a star exactly where it was needed, and crush it into a tailor-made black hole (Omega stood a little too close to the flame, so to speak - see *The Three Doctors*).

The resulting properties of this controlled black hole (later referred to as the Heart of the TARDIS) granted the Gallifreyans a better understanding of the fabric of space-time, and taught them how to stretch, fold, twist, collapse, and even punch a hole in space and time. The black hole itself was shunted into a pocket universe, and dimensional interfaces were constructed all around it, linking its fierce energies to independent travel capsules. Again, its not clear whether these capsules were initially capable of time travel, or if this was a later addition. The earliest such capsules were extremely dangerous to pilot, akin to early space exploration on Earth, but later refinement made them reliable enough to be commonplace.

As the technology developed, however, it created schisms in their society: Some embraced the idea of manipulating space and time to explore the universe and all its wonders - but others questioned the wisdom of relying on forces beyond all comprehension, and risking the destruction of reality itself through the misuse of those forces. The former group dedicated their lives to study, research, science, and reason. The latter group gradually became treated as outcasts, as the influence of these Time Lords spread throughout their culture.

Becoming a Time Lord means completing the academy, a task which would take a human lifetime from early childhood. Being accepted into the academy is not completely a matter of breeding, but it is rare for throwbacks or savages (those who come from ""the other side of the tracks"") to even be considered.

By the time the Doctor picked out Marnel's type 40 in the maintenance bays and decided to take it for a joyride, all of the above was practically ancient history. Rassilon had become a figure of near-myth, his later exploits and eventual fate shrouded in rumor. Omega was largely only remembered for his single technological contribution to their breakthrough. Travel in space and time was a matter of routine for Time Lord culture, and they had then long been immersed in the raw energies of the vortex.

By the time Theta Sigma was inspired to see the universe firsthand, rather than through a Matrix projected reality, Gallifrey's people had come a long way over the course of tens, possibly hundreds of thousands of years. And, by that same time, throughout the rest of the known universe, amino acids were only just beginning to bond into persistent forms.

But, for all their advancement, natural evolution on Gallifrey abruptly halted the moment the idea of Time Lords first came into being. This was, itself, intentional - they decreed that the whole of reality should be a fixed, known value which would neither flux, nor wither, nor change its state. They rewrote Gallifrey just as they liked it, locking it into their own ideal, and even attempted to preserve the whole of eternity as an immutable thing.

So no. TARDIS coral did not evolve naturally, neither was it designed through some form of genetic manipulation: It was created by rewriting reality itself. It also isn't the sole component of a TARDIS as a functional vehicle: Rather, that coral is the living factor added to the technological components allowing for better interface between the pilot(s) and the ship.",0,1384725268,null,0,false,0,cdgmrse,t3_1qsc5l,t1_cdgmrse,t1_cdg6fle,null,1428619665,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

I first went to him when I'd foolishly decided to cut my hair off (drunkenly) from shoulder length to about two inches long, and he fixed me! And he was such good fun and loved good wine, so we would talk wine during haircuts. Sadly, come the third haircut I was disappointed; there seems to be a thing with hairdressers whereby they make a huge effort the first time you visit to be amazing and thereafter they make very little effort, just doing the minimum required to make it look decent, but nothing like your very first haircut with them and certainly not enough to make you happy. You fellas are so much more fortunate in that you can chop and chose and it doesn't cost you a king's ransom. I have paid a king's ransom and less and still walked away thinking 'HMMM.' It's pretty hard work being critical when you're in a salon because it's not very British, is it? When I say 'please do not give me big hair', I must truly be talking in tongues, because *every* fucker does it. I DO NOT WANT TO LOOK LIKE A 1980S THROWBACK!

I think I'm going to place my faith in pornguy. I've also just subbed to /r/FancyFollicles and if I'm still not happy, I'll go to them for advice.

And, if you really want a brain baker to consider, what about Tennant's ""partial"" regen when he redirected the remainder of the regen energy into his severed hand? Does that count as a full regen?

true,AJH1779,eng-lancashire,Lancashire,"&gt; The best reason you can come up with that nurses aren't allowed to steal medication, is because you think the hospital will run out

Are you fucking kidding me? Are you deliberately misunderstanding me? Because if so, just say. No fine really, you can say it. You can say ""I have absolutely no desire to change my viewpoint on this. I have made up my mind."" I will take that as a note you in fact do not think there could be any justification for the police to detain a suspect for a period of time during an investigation into the deaths of several people if others say they are a nice person.

I was giving a reason why it was worse than stealing stationary, which is also a big no no. How do you possibly justify theft in any case? Because the NHS is wasteful? Well if all the nurses were at liberty to empty the stock cupboards of drugs at their own discretion, don't you think it would be bloody wasteful? Just because the NHS has a myriad of other problems doesn't change the fact it is still wrong to steal.

I seriously do not understand how you can consider stealing medication, of any kind, is somehow acceptable conduct of a nurse. It simply is not unless they have very good reason, and the nurse should be honest about it.

But since most of the rest of your post is simply an attack on me, I think I should educate you on something. Who *I* am is entirely irrelevant, I could be an NHS director, or a child in the slums of Sao Paulo. Not only is it irrelevant, it makes you immune to change, which makes this discussion just what I thought it was, pointless.

As for your other point about fingerprints being the hinge of the case. I repeat that we **don't** have all the evidence. The *physical* evidence may have consisted of fingerprints, but there are other forms of evidence which would be considered and not reported. When each nurse is on duty, who they are caring for, who administered the drips, who had opportunity, etc. These are all circumstantial, and likely why the case was weak, but it is going to be more than just fingerprints, even if that doesn't sell newspapers. It may have been the police had her as the prime suspect because *she happened to be the most likely to be doing the poisoning.*

So frankly no, you simply do not understand what you are talking about whilst talking out of your arse and thinking this somehow makes you better than me, which based on your conduct is simply not the case.

E: Almost overlooked your other ""point"":

&gt; We have this thing called the internet, you're on it right now 1. It allows us to gather knowledge 2. which can then be used to formulate opinions. I see you skipped right ahead to step 2.

Except your initial statement which I disagreed with the ""caring, competent, promising nurse"" was not really as truthful because she in fact was unprofessional in stealing drugs. The other point you made that she somehow was hideously wronged in being detained for six weeks I also disagreed, based on the *lack of information* we actually have. You made a strong judgement based on the little evidence you have gathered through the media which is not a police investigation or an internal investigation which actually have the authority to judge.

I hope you like reading, doesn't take much to type a few hundred words. Takes more time trying to pick whatever is relevant from your posts, since they are so filled with irrational vitriol.

Germany is awesome. I can really recommend Berlin. I've been once with family and once with work and loved it every time. There's a ton of culture there and some of their museum contents are amazing.

But dont fly into farking Schonefeld airport (where the cheap airlines go to!), there is nothing there (because they've been trying to close it and open a new one for a few years, so no-on will invest and a lot of the facilities are just closed), and if you get stuck there for say 5 hours there is nothing to do for that time...

The words of ""Scots Wha Hae"" are emotionally powerful, but there is a similar emotional power in the instrumentals of Fiddle and certainly in Perthshire Amber.

""Scots Wha Hae"" to some may seem to be a depressingly sad song of what was lost, but it's also about what Scots have stood up for.  Freedom, liberty, and self-determination.  Those things are what Scots once fought for, shed blood, and died for.  They didn't just fight the good fight then go home.

Then Torres has a great game, or Eto'o snatches a win or a draw out of nothing. There might be an argument for Luiz at CDM since Lampard has been objectively pretty poor so far, but Luiz hasn't exactly made the most of his time of the field and very clearly doesn't deserve the start over Terry or Cahill.

Just going down the list and trying be as realistic as possible:

Everton - Liverpool:
I would say this one is gonna end up a Liverpool win. Suarez and Sturridge are pretty much the only thing to get excited about on that team except maybe Coutinho. Everton might be able to frustrate them, but I think Suarez is too much on fire to be shut down. 

A-S:
Arsenal should win this for sure and send a little reality check to Southampton. I can't really see this one going the other way. Maybe a draw if Ozil disappears like he did against Utd.

City - Spuds:
This one could be funny since, depending on how you look at it, a team that can't be denied playing a team that doesn't let in goals OR a team that can't stop letting in goals against a team that can't score any. I think Spurs are going to play better defense than City will attack and will either draw it 0-0 or get all 3 points.

Us:
If we play Schurrle, we will win. If we run the attack through Ivanovic we will drop points. 

CC - Utd:
I'd say Utd are the strong favorite, but Cardiff has pulled off some nice results and they definitely can't be written off. If Utd come in looking to coast they will get beat. ",0,1384730224,null,0,false,0,cdgoyiu,t3_1qtw2j,t1_cdgoyiu,t3_1qtw2j,null,1428618644,5,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,5

What originally was a symbol against the pointless slaughter of war, has somewhat devolved into simply supporting our troops and by proxy the establishment. It has partly become, or perhaps always was and is growing more popular, a nationalist symbol of Britain and what 'we' fought for. In reality it should be a day to remember all victims of war and a time to reflect on whether there is a necessity in fighting at all.

For example for this remembrance day I was working in a shopping centre when we had the two minute silence. In previously years I had attended some in that place, and some elsewhere. Before the silence it would normally be announced by someone saying: ""We will now have a moment of silence for those victims of war."" Or ""We shall now remember those who died"". However this time a not very bright sounding girl said:

""We will now remember, and give thanks for those who died for this country""

This may be a minor example and only a slight trend away from the original meaning, to a more nationalist one. But I have seen the poppy change in the last twenty years to wearing it as a sign of loyalty to the country and a mark of respect for Britain's loss rather than the world's. It's a subtle change and certainly not yet a serious one but I do want the symbol to return back to it's more pacifist and universal origins.

true,landlordfeefraud,null,null,"""Can you expand on what the police would actually do with a report""
Take statements from the relevant letting agency employees, put them on notice that they are under criminal investigation, make a report to the procurator fiscal who will ultimately decide whether to prosecute. There are alternatives to criminal court proceedings, such as agreeing to a Fiscal Fine.


""One being the contravention of regulation for which there may be some penalty, and one being something that can result a criminal prosecution?""
Yes, you are correct that this is not well understood. Charging a premium is a criminal offense, with the penalty being a fine at level 3 on the standard scale. This would be prosecuted in the District Court (or JP Court as they are now known), together with other reasonably minor statutory offences carrying small fines.

There are other pieces of (housing) legislation, such as the deposit regulations, which specifies that certain conduct is unlawful - but this does not rise to the level of criminal conduct. The distinction is when the legislation uses the words ""shall be guilty of an offence"" or ""liable to a fine at level X on the standard scale"" means the matter can be prosecuted before the criminal courts.

So charging a premium is a crime, whereas failing to secure a deposit is not.

In practice, what is likely to happen is that the police will attend at the letting agent and speak to the individual member of staff who has signed the receipt, or otherwise the owner or manager of the office. As it is a crime, it would be for the police to take a statement, give a crime reference number, make investigations, establish if there is sufficient evidence, and submit a report to the procurator fiscal. It is the PF who decides whether it is in the public interest to bring a prosecution.

The key thing here is that the police investigation will put the letting agent on notice that this is a matter where criminal proceedings could be brought. Perhaps not the first time they do this, but if the police and crown office receive multiple reports about the same firm breaking the law, they may commence a prosecution. There are other ways to deal with this matter, such as a Fiscals' Fine.

My understanding of the law is that it would be the individual employee who took the payment who would be subject to a prosecution. If they are spoken to by police, I think most right thinking members of society would think twice before repeating conduct that the police has advised could lead to a criminal prosecution. I think most would rather tell their employer that they will not break the law, and potentially risk being disciplined...rather than face a criminal record which may prevent future employment. Terminating an employee for failing to comply with an illegal company policy would almost certainly be grounds for an unfair dismissal claim.",0,1384730706,null,0,false,0,cdgp5xg,t3_1qazug,t1_cdgp5xg,t1_cdbnr9m,null,1428618548,1,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,1

The number of outages I had was unreal, their customer service was akin to calling Satan's minions and this was only two years ago. NO. Just no. 

Your poor dad :(. Is he doing okay? Is your mum panicking like a mofo or completely in control? I'm assuming they are still married, perhaps naive of me. 

&gt;oh dear, i have a similar thing with my family - I talk to my sister a few times a year 

I fell out with my sister 2.5 years ago and haven't regretted it for a day since. I genuinely think my life is better without having her in it. She developed a hugely sanctimonious bullshit complex over the last three or four years whilst her marriage broke down, and without even asking for advice I would get hours of lectures on what I was doing wrong with my own life. One particular incident springs to mind. We went for dinner a few days after I'd tried to give up smoking, she tried to preach to fuck at me that telling my boss my plans for my future career (I was a temp and was always going to leave and discussed how/when to do so with boss) was the *worst* possible thing I could ever do; she was of the belief that withholding information was key and that by disclosing my desire for more money, I'd made myself instantly sackable and now that I had told her that, I'd made myself vulnerable and open for a cheaper replacement; six weeks later after an honest chat with my boss I got a 3k payrise for the rest of my contract and shortly after that, I got a completely unexpected 1.2k bonus (I thought only permies got those, it was a huge hurrah day). My boss was nothing but supportive and understanding. The sister spent most of the dinner asking me why I was being so aggressive. Truth told, it wasn't the nicotine withdrawl, it was her preachy fucking bullshit. Also, it was a 4 month contract and I stayed for 13. Yeah, great advice, fuckwit. She'd spent so much time trying to psychoanalyse problems that she considered herself to be an expert in them. It's pretty boring listening to someone who thinks that they are always right regardless of information to the contrary, and whilst I can be an opinionated and stubborn minded cow at the best of times, I always think back to how that particular close-minded dinner revolts me. I DO NOT WANT TO CHOKE ON YOUR SHITTY, MISPLACED OPINION. Just go away. 

She's also the only person to have ever told me that she doesn't think that women over 30 should cut their hair short: it's a young person's thing and anyone over the age of 30 just cannot carry it off. Many months after I went short. 

What a c word!

I miss my nephews though. Must text them actually.

The rest of my family are hit and miss. My nan was a witch with nothing positive to say; 6 girls, 2 boys, all of whom are Daily Mail reader sorts, although my mum and one of the uncles are a little bit better than that (if and when they put their minds to it, it seems to be an old people thing to fall into the Daily Mail trap).

If you've no idea what I'm trying to convey then why not ask me. 

Klonowski refers to the Anna Klonowski Associates limited report that was done into Wirral Council and cost the taxpayer about £416,000. The report looked into a number of claims that a whistleblower who used to work for them made. As well as undercharging people by an estimated £3.3 million, Wirral Council overcharged a bunch of disabled adults to the tune of ~£760,000 then said they wouldn't pay it back as it would affect their benefits. 

In addition to all this there was a suspicious death that wasn't investigated, an allegation of rape that wasn't investigated when it should have been and taxpayer money going to a group linked to serious organised crime, but as you say why should you care? 

The files that were appendices to the Klonowski report were (in the main) not published and seem to show a different story to the narrative that it was all the fault of two officers in management who both left the employment of Wirral Council a day before the report was published, paid off to the tune of £110k each. 

Other documents show that councillors agreed the policy that led to the overcharging and therefore should take some responsibility rather than blame it solely on two former employees!",0,1384731771,null,0,false,0,cdgpm70,t3_1qu624,t1_cdgpm70,t1_cdgi84d,null,1428618339,-1,false,Liverpool,t5_2r21z,-1

Ironically it was first thought at the inception of radio that the public would become widely more educated than ever with the capability to broadcast the lectures of the finest professors in the land to every home in the country, while education has improved over time this new enlightenment age does not seem to be the case.

The issue when it comes to marketing that is that they are held down by this sense of inadequacy and intimidation from ever trying to even understand anything that occurs in academic discourse, they're told all the time there's people at the top who have this special knowledge about things that it's not your place to try understand, just mind your own personal affairs at the bottom.

Perhaps it's also an issue with the idea of the ""lowest common denominator"" brought about especially from broadcast media, whereas in other forms of media like books you can move up gradually to more advanced material that are virtually impossible to understand without starting with the basics.

Whereas with broadcast media like television in order to make the most money you have to reach the largest field of people, so any media that assumes knowledge in the viewers will alienate a large amount of viewers whether they have the capability to understand things or not, even just a small percentage of viewers being alienated in this way would ruin the chances of any large success (which seems roughly to increase exponentially with viewers rather than arithmetically).

This is why even documentary series have to assume a large proportion of the viewers have not seen the earlier episodes and thus can not expand into more complex areas of the subject.

Like finding a 20ft snowdrift is condusive (sp?) to good sleep. Dear god man, what drugs do you take and can I have some, pretty please? 

&gt;Not at all, before I started with this I was a grumpy sit at home ""don't need no outside or exercise"" kinda guy. Got into climbing as a way to distract myself (when you're up on the wall you can't think about anything else but the ""now"").

I like the sound of this. My friends are becoming increasingly coupled up and babyfied; I think I need to start making new friends! Exciting stuff is a big bonus. 

&gt;So, other that salty nuts, what keeps you up at night?

Dreams of a husband I left 12 years ago and general day to day shit such as hating my sister. I also have some amazing speed/death related dreams. Confirmed adranalin (sp) junkie I think.

----------------------------------

oh absolutely, their are lots of other things that factor into a players decision, you wouldn't believe how close some players have come to signing with us only to pull out last minute over some minor shit..

I've said a couple of times Chelsea is a team with no loyalty (to a certain degree) they'll keep spending and keep buying the next wonder player and play them regardless of who already is in the team.. they've done it time and time and time again and although they have incredible depth as a result it means other teams are scrapping to pick up players that realize they've been conned with the illusion and the big pay rise

City I'm certain are going after a much more experienced, 'bigger' name. 

United wont bite unless they shift rooney or hernandez, Arsenal I can see going for him because they're dicks when it comes to shit like this..

that's the headache, I think (and we know) Suarez could be just as deadly on the left and right wing but i don't think he's a viable long term option, but your right again, we'd need to have a just as proficient winger on the opposite side to really make it work but it would really boost the team

Khumalo had a trial with Spurs earlier this season and impressed manager Harry Redknapp who said: “He's not expensive and we had him over on trial and we like him.
“He's got potential and we've got a tie-up with the club SuperSport so we've taken him on.
“It will be a great chance for the kid. He's a great lad. He comes from a poor background and he's desperate for a chance, and we're going to give him a chance.”

This isn't really forshadowing but to be completely honest The Doctor has no right to call himself The Doctor anymore. Many recent episodes have commented on how his name no longer means what it's supposed to, and in it has in fact created a whole new meaning of the word.

In *A Good Man Goes To War*, River Song mentions that on a planet (said planet had been a topic of discussion throughout the episode due to one of the enemy soldiers actually meeting The Doctor on that planet, her home planet, and believing that he isn't evil and is a great man) the word 'Doctor' directly translates to 'Warrior'

Another example is on the episode *Cold War*, The Doctor is faced with the problem of having no one to talk to Grand Marshall Skaldak, because he knows that it will refuse to talk to a soldier. The captain of the submarine states that there's ""No other way, I'll do it."" to which The Doctor replies ""You're a soldier; he'll smell it on you. I'll do it"". The Captain then says ""And he won't smell it on you, Doctor?""

&gt;**The Doctor:** She came back. Opened up the heart of the TARDIS and absorbed the Time Vortex itself.

&gt;**Jack:** What does that mean exactly?

&gt;**The Doctor:** **No one's ever meant to have that power. If a Time Lord did that he'd become a god—a vengeful god. But she was human. Everything she did was so human.** She brought you back to life. But she couldn't control it. She brought you back forever. That is something, I suppose. The final act of the Time War was life.

The passages mentioned use god as a general noun, rather than as the capitalized God seen in the Abrahamic religions.

2. The Army of Ghosts &amp; Doomsday (02x12 &amp; 02x13)
3. Utopia, The Sound of Drums, Last of the Time Lords (03x11, 03x12 &amp; 03x13) (These are important for later.)
4. Silence in The Library &amp; Forest of The Dead (04x08 &amp; 04x09) (I don't know if these are really important; it's just in case. It is quite a key moment in The Doctor's past &amp; future I think.)
5. Turn Left, The Stolen Earth, Journey's End (04x11, 04x12 &amp; 04x13)
6. The End of Time Part 1 &amp; 2

1. The Eleventh Hour (5x01)

2. Victory of the Daleks (5x03)

3. The Time of Angels &amp; Flesh and Stone (05x04 &amp; 05x05, Important for the season finale or you just won't get it)

6. The Doctor's Wife (06x04)

7. A Good Man Goes to War (06x07)(Important for Finale)

8. Let's Kill Hitler (06x08) (Important for if *she* ever comes back)

9. The Wedding of River Song (06x13)

10. Asylum of the Daleks (07x01) (Important for 50th? It's his last run-in with the Daleks until then.)

11. The Angels Take Manhattan (07x05) (Companion change!)

12. The Snowmen (Christmas 2012 Special, 7.X2)

13. The Bells of Saint John (07x06)

14. Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS (07x10)

15. **THE NAME OF THE DOCTOR**(07x13, extremely important episode as of now)

With 11's seasons you have to understand they run on a continuous story arc, which is why you need to watch lots of episodes to get the finale each time around, sorry.

They're the most important episodes as of (21/11/2013) but I **strongly advise that you watch every episode when you get a chance**, you will certainly not regret it.

If you absolutely must watch the special on Saturday specifically, I recommend the following episodes to get an overview: 

For 10: 
&gt;Army of Ghosts, Doomsday, Smith &amp; Jones, The Runaway Bride, Partners in Crime, Silence In the Library, Forest of the Dead, The End of Time (To get an overview of this Doctor's companions, plus his regeneration into 11th.)

For 11: 
&gt;The Eleventh Hour, The Pandorica Opens, The Big Bang, The Impossible Astronaut, Day of the Moon, A Good Man goes to War, Let's Kill Hitler, The Wedding of River Song, Asylum of the Daleks, The Angels Take Manhattan, The Snowmen, The Bells of Saint John, and The Name of the Doctor. 

In my opinion, those are the essentials just to get an overview of things for the anniversary special if you don't have time to go through the whole of the new series. 

Edit: And you can go back and watch the others later if you want. Or, just try to avoid spoilers on the anniversary episode, watch at your own pace, and watch it when you're ready, between now and Christmas. :-)",0,1384739538,null,0,false,0,cdgsui0,t3_1quz39,t1_cdgsui0,t3_1quz39,null,1428616760,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

That used to happen in Classic Who. When the show was brought back in 2005, it was revealed that a Time War took place and almost all the other Time Lords were cut off from the rest of the universe to prevent the war from escaping. The Master avoided the war and was able to meet the Doctor by accident, though he's now locked away in it as well.

&gt;If the time lords had the ability to move through space and time, couldn't they see what was going to happen if the demise of the time lords is a fixed point?

If it was a fixed point, foreseeing it wouldn't do them any good. If it's not a fixed point, it's precisely because history can change that traveling to the future doesn't give much warning -- the future they see may not be the one that comes to be.

&gt;Also why does a race which travels through time have a concept of time if they can travel through it?

Everything has scarcity, whether there's one of them or a billion. If there were only ten mona lisas they would be worth a lot to anyone who wanted a mona lisa, if there were 6 billion they wouldn't be. Replace mona lisa with gold, music, whatever- it's still true.

the British pound is a fiat currency and it's not tied to anything.
