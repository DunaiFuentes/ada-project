Possibly a bit more if you're not ready to read loads of guides and watch lots of competitive action. Probably about 2000 hours of your time overall will be enough.

But who knows! Maybe you've just got the knack and can do it much faster than that! 

Main advice to offer would be to get involved with community action as much as possible, firstly it will get you some good friends to play with and secondly you'll find so much info around that will help you to improve as you go. 

Once you feel like you are competent at actually controlling the heroes, start to read the guides and in depth analysis of matches/players/heroes and it will open up a whole new world of DotA strategy that you won't even have thought about before.

Most people who would like to give the competitive scene a proper shot are tied down by that the fact they have to work 10+ hours of the day so have no time to improve and find/practice with a team.

I hope i50 (with its larger tournament and prize pool) will do some good for the scene, even if a UK team doesn't win it again, it will garner more interest from prospective sponsors and tournament organisers which is usually a positive thing.

The few people that have come close so far to making any waves in the scene seem to have fallen because of attitude problems. I dunno, maybe this is just a British sensibility thing. A couple of teams (e.g new Infused - ex BCE) have appeared and/or changed there roster recently so i50 will be interesting at least to see their results.

The current availability of UK community features I believe to be sufficient for the amount of interest there is, with higher numbers, the need for new tech/spaces will increase but currently there is no need/business opportunity.

The BBC as well as others which I've pointed out in my long post often host 'Middle East experts' that have come from think tanks that are ultra hawkish war mongers who have been central figures in bringing about war but they never make clear who exactly these people are, neither do they offer a list of organisations they are affiliated with which would make the reader/viewer sceptical of their stance.

[From 10/4](http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/1nnojg/breaking_yword_can_result_in_arrests/cckeou9?context=3):

&gt; I'm Jewish. I'm of two minds about how okay I am with the ""Yid"" moniker. I wouldn't use it myself, but I won't begrudge Spurs fans using it for themselves when they're acting in good faith. That said, I think the community needs to think harder than ""We'll sing what we want!"" about the history and meaning of the word. It's background and usage were, until very recently, solely and exclusively anti-Semitic in the Western World. That's a very hard legacy to just paper over without some quality soul-searching. We should tread lightly here.
&gt; 
&gt; Ninjedit: if there's anyone who should be investigated for anti-Semitic language/behavior, it's opposing fans who ""joke"" about the gas chambers or remark about ""money-grubbing"" or make hissing noises. That shit's vile.

[From 9/14](http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/1mc8vm/a_jewish_take_on_tottenhams_yid_question/cc869rp?context=3):
&gt; A fellow Jewish supporter here - posting from the middle of my Saturday morning class (scheduled especially for today), where they are serving breakfast (which I can't eat), and at which I cannot properly pay attention (because I have not eaten). I could go on for a bit about the amusing appropriateness of a group of Jews discussing their multiple opinions about a subject related to Jewish self-identity and race, but I want to underscore a point I made a few days ago here, and which is reflected in OP's link but which I think should be reinforced.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Yid"" is a vulgar word. It's derogatory and hateful and comes from a place of hatred and intolerance. It is the non-English equivalent of the word ""kike"", the Jewish equivalent of the word ""nigger"" or ""chink"" or ""mick"" or ""wetback"". Whatever we want it to mean, or however we want to use it, that meaning has not disappeared; there are millions of Jews still alive today who have suffered the insult of being on the receiving end of that word - in the United Kingdom, in the United States, across Europe, wherever. My father came to America in 1961, after 12 years in the Soviet Union; his travel papers listed his nationality not as ""Ukrainian"" - he was born in Kiev - but as ""Jew"", because Jews were considered an ""Other"" population within the USSR. He remembers being addressed as ""Zhid"", the Russian variation of ""Yid"", many times during his childhood, never mind being approached by curious children looking for horns on his head and hooves for feet, because they'd been taught by their parents that this was what Jews looked like.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not saying that words can't change their meanings, or be reclaimed from a dark and disgusting past. But I am hesitant to be quite so protective of the ""Yid Army"" moniker and its related chants and self-identifications among Spurs supporters. I think there would be quite a bit of shock, consternation, and discomfort in the black community if there were a team based in the Compton neighborhood of Los Angeles whose fans called themselves ""Crips and Bloods United"" or proclaiming that theirs was the ""Coon Army"". I think race and derogation are too complex, as historical problems on both sides of the Atlantic, to think that we can re-appropriate the terms associated with them for our own purposes.
&gt; 
&gt; If our fans are going to use the word ""Yid"" - and I am not, repeat not, saying no words can ever develop different meanings and applications - I think they, and we, have an obligation to make sure that its history is fully and completely understood in its proper context. And I think we should be careful before we proclaim or decide, as a collective group of fans, that we can say ""Yid"" without offending our own fans, or Jews generally. The source of its usage for us (the long-standing association of the Jewish community with Tottenham and North London) is an admirable thing to respect and to try and turn around against anti-Semitic assholes from other clubs. But it's a delicate subject, and should be addressed delicately.

Basically the BBC (and many other television producers) used to routinely wipe old programs from the master tapes so the tapes could be reused. Those tapes were expensive and it saved them a lot of money by reusing them, and there really wasn't an incentive at the time to archive the old shows, they didn't think anyone would want to watch old TV shows.

Because of this a lot of historic TV is gone, lost. 106 episodes of Dr. Who from the first two doctors are currently missing.  I heard once that the only reason we have Monty Python's Flying Circus was that someone stole the master tapes so they couldn't be wiped.

In most cases when a lost episode is found it's because it was transferred to film for international distribution. Once in a while film copies of something that was transferred get rediscovered in an archive or someone's closet or something.

When he had the central role under AVB last season, the whole team was sort of set up from the outset for Gareth to play in that spot and to get the best out of him, so much so that players like Sigurdsson and Holtby were pushed out of position from minute one.

Well firstly we have to remember the BBC are NOT there to cater to what you specifically want, but more for what the people of the country want to see. If we want to see Reality shows etc. then its that we see.

On your point of them having nothing for public service, that's blatantly untrue. 

Skipping over the entire Cbeebies and the CBBC channel, which cater to the young, there are lots of documentaries and talk shows designed to cater for discussion. For example, tomorrow night I count 9 separate shows across the four main channels between 7 and midnight. Ontop of that there are several other shows like Question Time designed to do this. Yes we no longer have things like the OU or Sky at Night, but the world changes and so must these shows.


Finally, I always find this argument about BBC news to be comical. Of course they report what the party in government has said, that is sort of what caused the news piece in the first place. They then follow the format of a presenter talking about what it could mean, often with a graphic to help show it. They then get an opposing politician or two to discuss why its apparently bogus.

Thats all a NEWS show should be doing, not giving an argument for either side. Thats what channels like Question Time or Newsnight do.",0,1381261868,null,0,false,0,ccno4gk,t3_1nz5ay,t1_ccno4gk,t1_ccnnejz,null,1429200310,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I'd still recommend registering with a GP as soon as you can, though.

2) Three do what they call an ""all you can eat data"" tariff. I doubt it's truly unlimited, and I think they block tethering, but assuming you're not using it to torrent stuff 24/7 through your phone it should do the job. It's worth shopping around though, the available tariffs and plans change on an almost weekly basis.

3) I can't really tell you except to say that when I bought my wife a Kindle HD last year she had a hell of a problem setting it up to connect to her Amazon (US) account. She did manage to do it eventually but I suspect you might run into similar issues.

4) The current government is pushing hard to get as much paperwork stuff online as possible (basically because of austerity measures, so they want to sack as many civil servants as possible). But it does mean most common things, from filing taxes with HMRC (assuming you won't be PAYE), to renewing your car's tax disc, to registering with the local council on the electoral roll, can now all be done online.

5) I'll have to pass on this one. When my wife first came over here she found Citibank very helpful as they had branches both in London and in Philadelphia (which is where she's from). That was a good 14 years or so ago, though, and obviously the banking industry has changed a lot in that time.

If we're talking more realistically, hard to say. This may be controversial but I could see Balotelli excelling in that role, he has the strength and guile to hold up play really well, contributing to our 'total football' attacking movement, while also having clinical finishing abilities. I know he just transferred to Milan, but they're currently in 12th, so say we make CL for next year, keep Suarez one more season, finish top four again, Suarez goes to RM, and Milan finish out of Europe both years I could see him tempted to move. Now whether his temperament and consistency will be good enough is a fair question, but I don't think anyone can doubt his skill. 

Another great option, although pretty unrealistic would be Manzukic. Now obviously he will never jump ship to Liverpool from bayern, but if he somehow ends up forced out of the starting XI, and/or doesn't feature in Guardiola's plans he could look to move elsewhere. 

Not sure if there's any obvious locks for answers, both in that they'd fit the system enough, be talented enough to replace Suarez, and want to play for Liverpool and be affordable to buy, so it's all just speculation.

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"&gt;The whole point of my post was that he doesn't sacrifice or alter this philosophy for anyone. Most of your response fails to understand this simple point. It's incredibly naive to think that a brand of philosophy doesn't adapt depending on whether you're playing against Hull city or Man City.

But you, with hindsight, can't suggest valid alternatives. Taking injuries and other factors into consideration for the examples you gave AVB is essentially hamstrung. You suggest Sandro vs Chelsea, but it seem that he was fit. I touch on your suggestion to put Townsend on the left below.

&gt;You may think so, but it was informative nonetheless (e.g. he set out the same as NLD at WHL last season). Our back line was almost identical to last season, but still struggled massively with Giroud and Walcott.

If something isn't broken... I am not sure of the issue here. The high line worked last season against the same set of players. AVB went with it again and it didn't work, I don't see what reason he had to change it.

&gt;Is there any stat more meaningless than table positions after 7 games? 

You cut my quote off at the point where I mention the streak goes back as far as the Newcastle/Wigan games (not just this season). In fact, we are in a very healthy position when looking at all results in 2013. 

&gt;You also completely fail to take into account the fact that we've only played Chelsea &amp; Arsenal out of the top 6 so far (every other team barring Arsenal have played 3+ games) taking one point

We took 0 points from the same fixtures last year (5-2 and 2-4 compared to 0-1 and 1-1). Not wanting to pick at small things here, but City have only played Utd, Chelsea have played us and Utd (for 2 points) and Utd have played Liverpool/City/Chelsea for 1 point. So your comment 'every other team barring Arsenal have played 3+ games is simply not true, Utd are the only ones and they picked up 1 point. 

&gt;Sandro must be fit enough if he was allowed to play the full 90 minutes against Anzhi after 10+ hours of travelling on one of the worst pitches I've ever seen.

No, easier competitions with less risk are always used to ease in players. Kaboul played for the U-21's last season and wasn't close to a PL berth. Being fit for Europa League group matches (where Harry Kane is valid player) is not the same as being PL fit.

&gt;Siggy, Holtby, Defoe. The argument is not simply about playing a natural wide player, but adapting to the game (e.g. the lop-sided nature of our attack and West-Ham's defines). Even switching Siggy and Townsend on the pitch would of at least of been a bit more interesting.

I simply disagree that those are valid options on the right. In fact, I would consider all suicide. But let's not squabble over that as it is clear we degree on something that is purely subjective. That may be the reason we are on opposite sides here. I don't consider those options, when coupled with the injuries (and integrating new players) I don't see what room AVB has really had to move thus far. 

&gt;You paradoxically say that our defense is one of the best in the league based on a few games against lower placing teams, but when I mention that against these same teams we've struggled to score, it's invalid? 

I think there are reasons aside from AVB to explain the lack of goals. For example, our defensive set-up is barely changed from last season (Lloris, **Rose**/Naughton, Vertonghen, Dawson, Walker), it is safe to say that it is settled and we can draw conclusions from that. Our offence on the other hand has been revamped (Dembele, **Paulinho**, **Eriksen**, Siggurdson, **Soldado**, **Townsend**), I don't think it is fair to draw such harsh conclusions so early. Especially when all indications are that goals will come (possession, shots, chances etc).",0,1381264306,null,0,false,0,ccnp3pp,t3_1nzhpb,t1_ccnp3pp,t1_ccnjk4r,null,1429199853,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Never the less though, just looking around most cities in the southeast there is ample brownfield building space on old disused industrial land.

It's no use just building houses - they have to be affordable, in the right place, connected to local ammenities like schools and buses etc. That sort of thing takes time.

I will conceede though that the rate of house building now is insufficient and the government ought to be doing more to encourage it. I suspect they are afraid of dumping supply onto the market as high demand is pretty much the only factor pegging prices as high as they are.

It wouldn't buy a house in the south east but it *would* buy a part-share flat or small house. A couple (say a teacher on £30K and a nurse on £20) could get a respectable family starter-home in most parts of the UK under this scheme with just £10K in the bank... whereas previously they would have needed closer to £40K - and thats a tall order for people in their late 20s to save. And I'm all for that, after all these guys are mostly late 20s/early 30s and looking to have children, and they need the security of home ownership to do that. Its one thing for students to rough it for 3 years in a damp rental house, but when you have kids thats another matter.
 
I actually agree with Cameron on this - it irks me that young professionals that have worked hard to secure excellent career jobs cannot get on the housing ladder for lack of a deposit - whilst low paid unskilled labourers of their parents generation on ~£18K who bought in the 80s/90s are now sat on very valuable property.

With the right enforcement this could be one of the conservatives best policies imo. Personally though I think it needed to be coupled with a clamp-down on Buy-To-Let. That would encourage amateur landlords to sell, which would dump property onto the market that would be ideal for these kids to buy. In effect they would be buying the homes they are currently renting - then renovating them.

true,VaqueroGalactico,null,null,"First of all, I really appreciate your questions and the goal of discussion and improvement. I agree that there have been some serious problems with our game this season, and they have been obvious at times in our first seven games.

[Here](http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/dec/01/the-question-harry-redknapp-tactically) is an interesting article about Harry's tactical brain. While he's always chosen to portray himself as an Englishman's Englishman with a disdain for tactics, there are notable instances of him changing the game through a tactical switch.

AVB, I think, is better at setting up his team from the beginning. Under his management, I feel like we have a clear game plan with defined roles for players, as opposed to 'Arry's more free-form style. In the long run, I think we are and will be a more consistent team because of it. It's still very early in the season, and our starting 11 this year has 5 or 6 new names, so I suspect he's focusing more on making ""Plan A"" smooth and effective. AVB is a man with a clear idea of how he wants his teams to play and I think he's trying to instill that style into his players. Over the course of the season, I would expect to see more tactical flexibility, but I suspect this early his focus is consistency of style.

As to your specific questions:

1. Interesting question. There are definitely games where I would love to see Sandro starting, but Dembele and Paulinho have done well overall. Last season we had problems with a lack of creativity in the middle, and against teams that play primarily defense against us the double threat of Dembele's dribbling and Paulinho's passing and shooting is a good thing, I think. Perhaps the two need to communicate a little better in terms of one of them staying back, but a draw against a team like Norwich or Fulham is not a positive result for us, so I understand the onus on moving forward and hopefully scoring.

2. Historically, AVB's teams tend to use one winger that comes in off the line (Hulk at Porto, Sturridge at Chelsea) and one winger who stays wider (James Rodriguez/Varela and Juan Mata, although he moved infield more). I would like to see Lamela on the right, cutting in with Walker overlapping, and Townsend on the left with instructions to stay wide more of the time.

3. He's not naturally a winger... his natural game is to get into goalscoring positions, not to provide crosses for a striker. He's done reasonably well scoring goals from the left, but it is quite awkward without Rose overlapping as we pose no wide threat. I think he's decent defensively, but a winger he is not. That said, I don't think he's in our first 11 if everyone is fit and in form.

4. I think it depends on the team and the situation. Manchester United, Liverpool, and Manchester City, and Arsenal have shown that they have trouble when pressed, so I think that might be a great idea in those cases. Chelsea like playing on the counter, so this may be as effective, but if we play as well as we did that first half against Chelsea, I won't complain.",0,1381267458,null,0,false,0,ccnqcye,t3_1nzhpb,t1_ccnqcye,t3_1nzhpb,null,1429199266,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

There's Snowdon obviously (the Pyg path is my personal favourite, but the quieter paths on the western side of the mountain have a lot going for them too), but the Glyderau, Carneddau, the Nantlle Ridge and Moel Siabod also offer some great walks. Quite a lot of Snowdonia's 3000-ft mountains can be reached from Ogwen Cottage up the valley from Bethesda, so that would definitely be worth a visit.

Loads of other walks you can do, too. Anglesey's been mentioned, I see, but as there's a [path which winds itself along the entirety of Wales' Coast](http://www.walescoastpath.gov.uk/default.aspx), there's plenty of potential for coastal walks on the mainland too. There's also the three peaks of Yr Eifl on the Llŷn Peninsula - highly recommended both for the amazing views and for the substantial remains of an iron age hillfort on a subsidiary summit.

In secondary school we had a 'bring your own book' day, the teacher was away and the 6th former 'teacher in training' (not even qualified IMHO) didn't have a clue.  So I brought in a book I was reading.  Tom Clany's Red Storm Rising, not to every ones taste but I enjoyed it and was on my 3rd read through of it (so I was skimming it). 

Nobody else in the class was asked to read aloud to prove they were reading it, I was at this age a little nervous about public speaking and still am if I don't have any prep time; unsurprisingly I mumbled, stuttered and misread passages.

MY BOOK, that is MY property was confiscated and replaced with a dog eared copy of one of those 'Blue boy/Red boy' things you give infants, how one ended up in a secondary school I've no idea.   The singular reason was:

But this is a re-writing of our performances that simply isn't true. Look at West Ham for example, we came into the game thinking we'd steam roll them, but everyone seemed to forget that in the last game we were saved by a Gareth Bale wonder goal after going behind (deservedly) twice. They caused all sorts of trouble for our defence on that day as well. After that we squeaked by against Arsenal, lost to Liverpool and Fulham, drew with Everton, Wigan and Chelsea and then laboured to 1-0 wins against Southampton and Sunderland. The 3-1 against Man City was welcome, but we weren't playing particularly effective football towards the end of the season. That Man city game and the 3-0 win against Reading on 1st January were the only games we won by more than one goal in 2013.

26 hours on a coach from the Bridge to Munich, driving through the night stuffing our faces on some anonymous late night cafe in Belgium. getting to munich at like 11 in the morning all head to the marinpaltz. Found a nice little bar that did very big pints with lovely girls in that traditional german garb. Did mean to move on after a few but instead spent the whole afternoon. Filled up soo many munich fans, in the end it was 10 of us and over 500 of them but we still sung loud and proud. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvZSDJfw8Wc  (grey shirt and beard in the first few seconds is me) 

No violence, no nazi songs or german bomber just a really lovely chilled out atmosphere , i made sure to speak to as many german fans as i could. I love germany and think their the best people; the English and the Germans are so similar. 

Got on the tube; I was hammered at this point, shouting carefree across the whole carriage.     

Got outside the arena  at like 6 i think, passed out on the grass, woke up at like half 7 and it was just like 'oh yeah we got a cup final now, thats why were here'. Got a German hot dog when to the match. Lovely stadium, I reckon we were outnumbered 3-1 in there by munich fans, scary flags and loud chanting by them I knew this would be the toughest match we ever played and I couldn't bare to watch us lose.   

They score - just bugger and try to keep it together.

Drogba scores - YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS - o my god we have a chance .
Robben Penalty - FUCK!
Penalty saved -  ........this could be it, this could be the night.

warming up for penalties --  I was trying not to be sick.
Mata misses - that was it head in my hands blocked out all sound and vision, couldn't watch.

4 minutes later i look up and cole puts it away, the schwein misses. 

who is it? is it drogba? Its drogba! THIS IS IT! HE WILL SCORE THIS IS HIS DESTINY! 

and then the world erupted, i hugged the guy next to me, i looked over to see my friend late forties followed Chelsea all his life and he just sat on a step and cried, he couldn't take it in. seeing di matteo embrace romnan, seeing JT lift it and lamps and then mata, seeing drogba and torres hug, luiz sing and ivan on the bar. leaving the stadium was like a ghost town, the Germans were in quiet distraught and we just couldn't believe; no cheering just grinning like idiots  it It was magical and unfortunately all to soon over as it was back on the coach to drive 26 hours  back to London but it passed like a dream.

We even got back in time for the parade which was nice and finally made it real.

i watch all the you tube videos every-now and then and two things always happen; my heart catches in my throat and I think drogba will miss  and I get the warmest feeling when i see them lift it and it all comes flooding back. 

It wont be topped that it just wont, not even if we beat Arsenal 5-0 in a European final at Wembley.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Do you even watch Doctor Who?

&gt;I didn't see any evidence that Donna's relationship with her mother had changed, we just saw a wedding, what does that tell us? 

When Donna begins traveling with the Doctor, her Mother is extremely critical of him, the notion of traveling through time, and her ability to do anything meaningful with her life.  In an alternate timeline, she even goes as far as to call Donna a disappointment.  Yet at the end of Journey's End, when the Doctor says Donna was the most important person in the universe for a moment - her mother contradicts him by asserting that ""She still is [the most important person in the Universe], she is my daughter.""  The Doctor's response (""Maybe you should tell her that once in a while"") shocks and hurts her.  These dramatic difference in her views of her daughter symbolize how her opinion of Donna has changed over time.  That we didn't see much of a change in Sylvia's *actions* isn't too surprising - as she is portrayed as stubborn and proud person who wouldn't directly meet she is in the wrong.

Furthermore - you completely ignore the other part of Lesteriuse's argument which correctly observes that Donna's relationship with Wilfred has changed dramatically.  Wilfred loves Donna throughout the entire arc but his assertion that she is a ""better person"" after meeting the Doctor is not only a testament to how her character developed but also how deeply that development changed Wilfred.  Over and over again he begs the Doctor to some how change her back even though he knows that is impossible.  Wilfred's pain mirrors that of the audience: we watched Donna rise to incredible heights only to lose it all due to circumstances beyond her control:

&gt;Actually, Donna is the worst example you could think of, she was building towards a great arc and then she was set back to zero, undermining everything she went through. 

Donna losing her memories doesn't negate the significance of her actions or her journey.  She saved countless worlds regardless of whether or not she remembers it.  We also see plenty of times when Donna is compelled to do things for reasons she doesn't understand which are tied to her time with the Doctor, showing signs that she has in fact changed thanks to her time with the Doctor.  But from a real world perspective, the above isn't even the most significant factor here.  Doctor Who is just a story, there is no Donna Noble or TARDIS or Doctor.  The value of storytelling comes from the impact stories have on their audiences, not how imaginary characters ""feel"" or ""think"".  Regardless of what Donna remembers about her past, *we* remember it all and Donna's story arc is effective precisely because of how it ends.  There are plenty of people who meet the Doctor, do great things, and continue on their merry way.  We have heard that story before.  Donna's arc is deviates from this theme and presents with an extremely mundane character we can identify with and makes her time with the Doctor very tragic.  That is a dimension of Doctor Who that is under-explored but very important.

&gt;Rose has some good development in series 1, in series 2 she becomes more and more irresponsible. In total, her arc consists out the following: She starts of as being head over heels falling for the Doctor and ends as somebody that is so head over heels falling for the Doctor that she needs her own private Doctor to be happy. 

Rose does NOT start out as being head over heels with the Doctor.  She starts as a young woman who is unsatisfied with her life.  She works at a shop, is an a dull relationship with some guy, when suddenly this strange man shows up and offers her an adventure greater than anything she could even imagine.  Rose's so-called ""irresponsibility"" is anything but that.  One of the major issues being explored during her arc was how a companion's relationships change when they're with the Doctor.  That had never been discussed in any of the previous iterations of the Doctor Who and it laid the groundwork for Moffat's disappointingly barren exploration of the same idea.

Rose's ending is also much more nuanced than you dishonestly summarize it as being.  Rose was in love with the Doctor and expected to travel with him forever.  She eventually has to grapple with the idea that one day she will leave her - like he left Sarah Jane Smith - and that maybe his feelings aren't reciprocated. This possibility is suddenly and unexpectedly thrusted upon her when she is stranded in the alternate universe and once again is stuck in a dead end job. To make matters worse, her final exchange with the Doctor left things entirely up in the air.  He was about to profess his love before his hologram disappeared - or so she would like to believe.  Much was unsaid.  So in an instant she goes from traveling the universe with a man she loved, living her wildest dreams and in the next she is left entirely unfulfilled both in the sense that she didn't do nearly as much as she hoped with the Doctor and that she no longer can be with the man she loves.

Nevertheless, the changes in her character are dramatic.  She gets a sense of right and wrong, a desire to change the world and a knowledge of the universe which makes her totally different than those around her.  Her mother even wonders if one day she will cease to be human altogether because of her journeys with the Doctor.

&gt;Watch The Eleventh Hour and then watch the Rory in series 6, taking on Cybermen and punching Hitler in the face. Watch Amy in The God Complex

Which is precisely Lesteriuse's point!  Rory's grand change has nothing to do with anything that happens on screen and everything to do with some lousy plot twist Moffat concocted.  Yes Rory goes from an awkward and insecure boy to a self-assured warrior -  but that change comes not through his adventures with the Doctor but rather a very specific event.  The old Rory is literally erased from time and replaced by duplicate made solely from Amy's memories of him.  He was an idealized echo of Rory, whose confidence came only after 2000 years of change *that we never actually see*.    If you actually compare Eleventh Hour Rory to his later incarnation, its clear that all his ""improvements"" are derived from this event while most of his failings seen originally are still - quite irrationally - around.  Hell, in *Day of the Moon* he is STILL paranoid about Amy running off with the Doctor.  Your examples don't even contradict what Lesteriuse asserted.  Lesteriuse says he is a mumbler and after he punches Hitler he unassuredly mumbles about the entire situation they're in.  Lesteriuse asserts he unconditionally loves Amy and when he battles the Cyberman he does so specifically to save his life.

&gt;But don't start on character arcs and shit. Because that's exactly where RTD failed twice and Moffat has so far succeeded (although I'm a little worried with Clara at the moment).

If you like different companions than other people, that is fine.  But don't start shitting on other people for inventing things and not paying attention to the show when you yourself do the exact same thing for the rest of your fucking post.  Does Moffat's characters show development? Of course.  Are Davies' characters perfect? Of course not.

true,ibpants,1972crest,,"Sure.  I worked briefly in the Quality department at Ticketmaster UK (and Ireland) and I think we *were* the only branch outside of North America at the time.  At one point they sent out a customer service document to all of the call centres with certain expectations and our manager got back in touch with them to tell them more or less to shove it up their arse.

The differences come from our national character.  We're naturally a lot more standoffish in the UK, more emotionally guarded, and generally suspicious of unwarranted friendliness (I could go into way too much detail, but I think this is due to the much higher population density in the UK, and I think the difference between northerners and southerners backs me up), we also have a long history of friction between social classes.  

What this means on the customer's end is that (all outcomes being equal) customer service is considered good when it's efficient and largely impersonal.  You're unlikely to be referred to as 'sir' or 'madam', chances are you won't be told to 'have a nice day', no one will pretend that they were happy to help you, you may feel like you've been hurried off the phone as quickly as possible, and if you're British and under the age of 65 you'll probably be glad of it.  

In the US, I can't speak so much for what customers actually want, but companies certainly believe that customers aren't quite so precious about their time, and that they are happy to indulge in the illusion of having a temporary friend.  There's also an expectation that customer service *should* go beyond expectation - they say things like this in the UK, but I don't think they appreciate what it means - it means accepting minor losses in order to keep future business, for instance ""Your shirt arrived unprinted, sir?  Please accept my apologies, sir.  I'll refund the entire cost, you can keep the unprinted one and we'll send you a printed one free of charge, sir.  I'm happy to have helped you today, sir.  Thank you for calling.  Have a nice day.""

Now the weird thing is that I've never met a Brit that visited the US and didn't prefer American customer service, because I think Brits are just as taken in by the illusion that Americans are all happy and friendly to everyone, but we know Brits, and we don't trust them when they seem happy for no good reason.

I studied the IB and needed 35 with 6, 6, 6 at Higher Level to get into my university (a fairly good one), if you could relate to that more easily. You specialise a lot earlier in Britain, so although you'd only take 3 A Levels as SirJadams said they go into a bit of depth. I know A Levels are about as hard as the IB in content (except you take half as many), so I think they would roughly correspond to AP level of difficulty.

I couldn't say if it would be worth going for A levels over a foundation course; I do not think you'd be able to study A Levels for free if you did go to college here so that might be worth bearing in mind, but I reckon academic A Levels will open more doors for you than they'd close, definitely. Most decent universities will ask for at least two Bs and an A at A Level, and the really good ones more. They tend to be a bit weird about unfamiliar qualifications; as I mentioned, I studied IB and some of my friends got offers worth maybe a hundred, two hundred UCAS points greater than A Level students applying for the same course (almost no universities use [UCAS points](http://www.ucas.com/how-it-all-works/explore-your-options/entry-requirements/tariff-tables) these days, but they're still handy for comparing your offers.

true,Dogba11,present,,"So this past summer Chelsea came to the U.S. for pre season. They established base in Washington D.C., about an hour away from where I live. Found out they were having training session at Catholic University and went through Chelsea tv/ twitter/ player's twitter/facebook to see what the pattern of training was. Realized there was almost always a morning session. So I went with a couple of friends to try to watch them train and maybe get an autograph if lucky. Went there drive was awful cause of traffic but there was no training at the time.

A couple of days later we tried again, I did more research and saw that Gigi Salmon on Chelsea tv said that there would be a morning and afternoon session the next day. So I went in the afternoon, it turns out Mourinho had canceled afternoon practice in the last minute because he wanted the players to get some rest before playing Madrid the next day. When I found out, I was really disappointed. So that was 4+ hours driving back in forth only for the taste of disappointment. 

But, you know what they say about the third time... We tried for the last time on Friday, the Roma game was Saturday (which I had tickets to) and I knew Friday was our last chance. So we took the all too familiar 1 hour drive to catholic university, and praise the lord training was going on!! There was a bunch of around 30-40 fans around the athletic complex (which had been shut down for the team). It was a closed training session like all the others apparently so we had to resort to watching training behind the back fence near the trees, view was okay but we kept getting harassed by security.

As the team was getting on the team bus the fans were behind the fenced gate calling out each player we saw (We were across the street of the gate because security not let us be on the same side of the street as the fenced gate. Was able to still see all the players walk from training to lockers then lockers to bus, they all waved to us which was pretty cool. 

Then, quite unexpectedly, with most but not all of the players on the bus the fence opened and out stepped DAVID FREAKING LUIZ!!! All the fans ran across the street. Somehow I found myself among the first few to reach him (I must've sprinted faster than Joe Cole in his prime :p) I was asking if he could sign my ball along with others when he said ""Kids first"" in his Brazilian accent it sounded like ""Keedz first"". He sounded quite scary but I think it was just his accent. Nonetheless, I didn't want to piss off a hero of mine so I kinda hung back till all the little snots got a picture, autograph or whatever. Then I politely, timidly asked him again. He happily signed it, and a friend got a decent pic of me holding my ball while he signed it. I was completely over the moon, didn't think of asking for a proper picture together until near the end. But by then it was really congested and he left soon after. I was kind of disappointed not to get a proper pic but there is one of him signing my ball.

They were the last to finally get rid of mechanical on-screen presentation ornaments (1985).  They were the last to switch to 24hr TV broadcasting (November 1997).  They were the last to go widescreen (1998).  They were the last to go HD in any form (2006?) and many flagship shows were SD-only well into 2010 with many regions and plenty of regional news studios still not upgraded even now.  They were the last to introduce an on demand service (Christmas Day 2007).  Now they're going to be the last to a basic +1 channel which will still be loaded with repeats.

BBC 2 may have been the first colour TV channel in Europe when it was upgraded in 1967, but even then, only a fraction of its content was in colour and only certain areas (read: Greater London) could receive it whereas the Americans enjoyed near-ubiquitous colour TV since about 1964.  The move off of 405 onto 625 lines was a lift-and-shift for everyone when the old signals were switched off, much like analogue signals recently.

true,enviousjealous,flair6,,"I'm a Londoner that married into an american jewish family and now live in the US. As another yank mention here, *Yiddo* doesn't mean much here. When I described the use of *Yiddo* and *Yid* to the older members of the family they didn't see much issue with it. Note, they are all, of course, quite sensitive to anti-semitism; having had large portions of their family wiped out in the holocaust. Even so they just chuckled and shrugged and we moved on.

Having said that, when discussing the current issue in more depth with the wife, I found it hard to create analogies that fairly represent the issue (this of course has been a feature of the discussion all over the media and the web). I tried replacing Yid with Kike, a far more common anti-semitic slur here (use of the nigger analogy are totally off-target IMO). Once I did that she said she would be uncomfortable with non-Jews trying to take ownership of the word.

So, not so clear cut, especially when looping-in people who are not familiar with the subject.

Personally I think this is really an issue for north londoners and the english football community alone. We can all pitch in from afar, but use of the word evolved in unique way in that environment. If you need to be educated that the word is offensive or not, then you can't really offer any insight, as the analogies available to understand the complexity are just too blunt – ""It's like Kike but, y'know, not as bad, as it had a different history""; or misdirected – ""It's like rappers saying nigger, innit"".

Personally I do think that this is an issue of people *choosing* to be offended. The fact that the issue is not clear cut is the perfect time to say enough of this. [I'm with Stephen Fry of the subject of offence](http://imgur.com/fGelg).

I just thought of another analogy that may work. Football in Britain has always been inextricably linked with the working class. If we applied the same logic that Baddiel is spouting to class, we should ask all supporters to not glorify their working class heritage, as this simply encourages opposing fans to deride their lower class status. e.g. West Ham fans are banned from referring to themselves as *the cockney boys* as this just sets up the song ""No Noise From The Pikey Boys"".

The working class has long been subjugated the world over, but no one is saying that people should not celebrate a link to it for fear of encouraging further subjugation. That's what is happening here, but with cultural heritage instead of class.

Because to teach it that way is a crime against ourselves as a society.  We insist on shoving square pegs into round holes then we wonder where the next Hawking, Darwin or Plato is.  We've taught them to hate something they love and for some that love never comes back, they're too bitter after their 'education' to ever think about it again.

I remember an adage about a child and parent dragged in to the head teachers office as the kid wasn't performing well in lessons.  The radio was playing music and the child couldn't keep their feet still.  The head teacher said ""You're child is a dancer, send them to a dance school.""  so the parent did and yes, that was indeed a dancer; I believe ultimately a famous one as well.

We as a society need to accept that we need to offer tailored packages for our children, we should be educating them not teaching them.  We need dreamers, writers, artists and such of all shapes and sizes because without those people and their love of their profession... who are we as a society?  Are we not defined at least in part by such peoples efforts?  How many people in this thread now bitter at the idea of Math or English would of been another Hawking or Dickens or Babbage?

As I've said, I don't support banning the word, and if British law *is* inclined to police the use of derogatory language I think that action should be directed at the fans of other teams who use it purposely to insult, rather than at Spurs fans who use it to signal their fealty to the Jewish community of North London and to proclaim common cause in their fandom.

true,SuperSonic4,eu,Burrrmin'am,"&gt;If someone has been libelled, they can sue. If laws are broken, the police can prosecute.  The MP expenses scandal showed what the problems of press regulation are. Numerous FOI requests met with repeated stonewalling until a whistleblower sold the data to The Telegraph. 

They can but how far is an individual likely to get when the paper may as well have infinitely deep pockets and can hide any bad press. I also remember how long it took anyone but the guardian to admit the phone hacking scandal

&gt;You're right, the press is censored in a financial sense. If you don't like what they print, don't buy the paper. It's creepy and illiberal to have the state decide what should and shouldn't be in a newspaper.

If only it was that simple. If I stop buying a paper it doesn't mean everyone else does. Sensationalism sells and there is nothing more sensational than a barely true story. 

&gt;If this passes, we'll end up with a ridiculous situation where the newspapers can't print stuff that's common knowledge on the internet because news sites based in the USA enjoy first amendment protections that we're so keen to do away with.

It's not a binary issue and whilst I admit that it may get out of control if not checked I do feel limited laws necessary to curb the excesses including trial by media and making sure everything is verifiable fact.

The issue with the Asian gangs has been that they're nearly all of Pakistani background, they groomed the victims in question, used violence and drugs, they worked together, they pimped out these girls to often hundreds of other men from their community (and even found doctors willing out to carry out back alley abortions), and once these men have been convicted we start hearing stories about how the community were not in the dark about what was going on.


When a demographic is over represented in a certain crime it is pertinent to take notice and recognise we might have a specific problem within that community. However there has been a complete reluctance by the state to do this.

We recognise and have mechanisms in place to deal with caste discrimination in the Indian community, as we do for FGM in the Somali community, and for gun crime in the black community. It is not taboo to talk about these things yet it somehow is to do so for Pakistani peadophile rape gangs.

The key difference here is that none of those other groups are a solid voting block for the Labour Party unlike the Pakistani community, this leads to them being reluctant to even recognise that there is a problem and the Conservatives are trying to distance themselves from their old racist image.


And I am afraid that state inaction will lead to people taking justice into their own hands. This year in Leicester it turned out that a group of Pakistani men were doing this to a Sikh girl, this resulted in a group of Sikh men stabbing five Pakistani men they believed were the perpetrators (turns out they stabbed the wrong men).",0,1381304966,null,0,false,0,cco2152,t3_1o1ovk,t1_cco2152,t1_cco1m7v,null,1429193737,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,myimportantthoughts,cnty-uk,It's grim up North London,"&gt; The average wage for an Oxford maths student six months after graduating is £43,000, £20,000 more than the average for maths students across the country.

I wonder if this takes into account differences between students before they reach Oxford (I don't think it does). Obviously the students getting into Oxford have very high A-levels and interview well, so it would be more fair comparing eg. someone with AAA who *didn't* go to Oxford and someone who did.

I imagine that the difference between someone with AAA at A-level who went to Oxford and someone with AAA who went to Manchester/Imperial/LSE/Edinburgh/Kings would be nowhere near £20K, though there might still be a difference.

The maths student with eg. BCC at A-level is already way less likely to make £40K after graduation than the AAA student *even before their first day at university*.

And I never claimed that SM DOESNT use DXM. I simply said RTD uses DXM in ALL his season finales without any/much explanation. At least season 1 we saw bad wolf all over the place but after that it was just all over the map. SM's DXM is always about reality being shattered and trying to fix a paradox and season 6's Teselector was introduced much in advance and he simply made the logic work for the case. Like most other things it was put in there before hand to ""fix"" that part of the story about the fixed point in time which required him to be there at that exact spot. It's simply a loophole which gets revealed at the right time and is NOT DXM. DXM is when you pull a god/godlike powers out of nowhere and use it to ""fix"" everything. Considering the fact its part of the time agency of which we are familiar with Captian Jack Harkness, seen the effects of it in ""lets kill Hitler"" it's simply using stuff that's been part of the story for quite a while. Thats just careful planning on SM's part. How is that not continuity? He has a consistent premise wibbly wobbly time, fixed points, paradox when fix points are violated. Then sets forth to create his story from that and existing canon: Doctor has fixed point, whole season revolves around him avoiding it, season ends with him resolving it.  Theres no DXM at all. 

River song isnt a plot hole. Shes as much a plot hole as Harkness is. She's simply traveling through a different times and every meeting with the Doctor is just another intersection. She just happens to be traveling backwards in our perception of time because the first time we meet her is at the end of her timeline. 

The only time RTD put anything together for the finale was season 1 where there was bad wolf all along their travels but even that's really shaky as it had very very little to do with the story.

The problem we have is the BBC and Sky News who are constantly raping our minds with stuff to do with Islamic Extremism, we're fed the line that we are under threat from everyone who lives in the middle east because they don't like us.


It's not our way of life they hate, it's our foreign policy etc. The sooner everyone realises that yes, we do have a threat to our security but NO we won't give up our privacy the better we can be.

Don't believe everything you read in the Daily Mail, don't believe everything you see on TV and most of all hear from people online (Such as myself, don't believe me) 
The fact of the matter is we could all die at any point, today tomorrow next year etc. The problem is how we're being pushed down by fear.. and the fear that we need GCHQ and the NSA to keep tabs on everyone for our protection.

**In Bangor** there's just [Gwynedd Museum and Art Gallery](http://www.gwynedd.gov.uk/gwy_doc.asp?cat=3657&amp;doc=13261&amp;Language=1&amp;p=1&amp;c=1), but Penrhyn Castle is pretty stunning once you get in there.  

There's also Pontio who arrange various things around the town and you'll probably see one of their events books laying around somewhere.  They will at some point become a big arts centre, gallery, theatre, cinema etc. but that's probably not going to happen before you leave.

A little further afield in Caernarfon, there are three places:

* [Galeri Caernarfon](http://www.galericaernarfon.com/eng/events/events.php) is a theatre/cinema with a small gallery.
* [Oriel Pendeitsh](http://www.gwynedd.gov.uk/gwy_doc.asp?cat=26&amp;doc=62&amp;Language=1&amp;p=1&amp;c=1) is inside the Tourist Information Centre that's directly opposite the castle entrance.
* [Bocs](https://www.facebook.com/BocsCelf) is a small arts centre just down the road from Oriel Pendeitsh.  They have a focus on work by young artists but they're closed for refurbishment in October, though.
* If you're going to be in Caernarfon, you might as well check out the Roman fort at Segontium too.  (I'd suggest doing it in the summer, though.)

In Conwy:

* [Mostyn](http://mostyn.org/) Llandudno is probably the biggest, fanciest contemporary art gallery in North Wales.  I'm quite a fan of the place but don't get a chance to go out and see it as often as I'd like.
* [Venue Cymru](https://www.venuecymru.co.uk/) is a theatre.  If you're looking for the big, touring shows, they'd mostl likely be here.
* [Cineworld Llandudno Junction](http://www.cineworld.co.uk/cinemas/42) is pretty much the only multiplex cinema you'll find before you reach Chester.
* [Conwy Food Festival](http://www.conwyfeast.com/) is coming up at the end of Oct, it's pretty good.  The whole town is taken over with interesting food stalls, live music and live art events.  I **think** the digital arts festival [Blinc Digital](http://blincdigital.com/?page_id=2563) happens in the same town and on the same days as the food festival but after dark. 

On Anglesey :

* [Oriel Ynys Mon](http://www.visitanglesey.co.uk/en-GB/oriel_ynys_mn-16.aspx) in Llangefni, Anglesey.  It's another big gallery but the work in there tends to be a lot more traditional and less challenging than that shown in a contemporary gallery like Mostyn.  They also have a museum room which has some interesting bits.
* [Oriel Tegfryn](http://www.artwales.com/gallery-ot-en.php) in Menai Bridge is a commercial gallery, but it's still worth having a look around if you're in the area anyway.  After going there, I'd suggest walking down to the edge of the Menai's waters so you can go under the bridge (the view is amazing), then walk around to Church Island (a small island completely covered in grave stones) and then back up for dinner at the Jade Village.  (The best Chinese restaurant for miles).

true,_njd_,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"Partly because BT has allocated blocks of local numbers to ""Communications Providers"", taking out entire ranges of numbers. Also three-digit DDI prefixes for businesses to claim a thousand numbers for private use.

What do Communications Providers use the numbers for?  
Maybe this: [""Look like a Bradord based company""](http://www.dbs-uk.co.uk/telecoms/local/bradford-phone-number.html)

&gt; use an 01274 Bradford phone number and point it to your landline.
&gt; Numbers are also available for 479 UK towns and cities.

I'm not sure why BT couldn't have allocated in each area at least one unused initial digit or digit-pair that could be a prefix for a new range of numbers: you can't use 1 or 9 (because 999 and 112, 1471, 150, etc), but what if all (say) Bradford numbers start with digits 2-8, but none with, oh I don't know, 23----?

Then you could use 23 as the prefix for a new range of numbers: 10,000 if you keep to six digits, but you could allow seven and go to 100,000: 2300000 to 2399999.

About nineteen years ago BT solved this problem in Bristol, Reading, Leeds, Sheffield, Nottingham and Leicester; they changed to entirely new region codes with a prefix (like ""2"" or ""9"") in front of all the existing numbers. So Leeds became 0113 2nnnnnn. You can only do that trick in seven or eight places, but the point is they added a seventh digit, allowing for ten times the capacity.

**--Edit--** Could it be that contacts software, phone firmware, smart-phone operating systems and (more likely) crappy old switching equipment _still_ only allow 11 digits for UK phone numbers?

They're being used to hit targets in Pakistan by the US government, and *that* isn't good...but the idea of an unmanned Predator/Reaper drone is OK. I mean, ultimately, there's no difference between bombing a Taliban hideout with a drone vs. an F-16, an Apache, or a cruise missile.

I don't buy the ""It takes the humanity out of combat"" argument either--my response to that is ""Great!"". Humanity is the *last* thing you want in combat...sure, you hear stories about things like the German fighter plane escorting a damaged Allied bomber back to base, but the reality is that, in an emotionally kinetic combat situation, a soldier or pilot *in legitimate fear of his or her life* and pushed to the breaking point by stress is going to make some pretty poor decisions: are you more likely to judge, objectively, whether the figure on the horizon is a journalist with a TV camera or an insurgent with an RPG when you're in a hot, sweaty pilot's seat, knowing he could squeeze a round off at you, or you're in a cool, air-conditioned trailer and you've got nothing on the line?

Another example--the Haditha massacre, in which a group of 12 US Marines from 3rd Battalion in Haditha, Iraq massacred 24 Iraqi civilians. They had been on significantly extended tours, much longer than the normal time period a soldier is supposed to be in a combat zone. They'd just lost a comrade, they took fire from an unknown location and ended up killing a *lot* of innocent people.

They should be punished for their crimes, as *nothing* can excuse mass murder like that. However, it's worth exploring. None of us in this subreddit would ever say we'd kill someone--it's completely unthinkable. But what happened to those guys? If we were the 13th member of that platoon, we were actually in the thick of it, would any of us raise the flag? Why did they get to the point that they did? It's an easy out to say they are just monsters. But how did 12 monsters happen to be put in a platoon together?

I think when you put people under that kind of constant life-threatening stress, they can break. Just like soldiers who leave for war normal, and come back with terrible flashbacks causing them to have outbursts they'd *never* normally have. Drones, and combat automation in general, seem like a solution to this problem. Sure, it's stressful to be in any combat situation, even if you're a drone pilot, but I trust people to make better decisions when their life is not on the line.",0,1381314679,null,0,false,0,cco36ra,t3_1o1iml,t1_cco36ra,t3_1o1iml,null,1429193198,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

The sat nav analogy is very simplistic but sort of right. The receiver has a clock in it and calculates it's location using the time it takes for the signal to be received by the satellites, the clocks in satellites are supremely accurate atomic clocks, fractions of a second are lost every few years, the satellite sends its accurate time down to the receiver ~~and the receiver sends back it's signal with the accurate time it received the signal, the time taken for that return journey is calculated and~~ **edit** signal received on the ground and time calculated there. an approximate distance is given, psuedorange. More satellites means a more accurate fix as the timing can only be so accurate from one satellite but as you increase the number the area of possibility becomes even smaller, think of a Venn diagram with 6-7 circles all at the same distance from the centre, the point where all the circles overlap is very small. Add in a local ground station at a known location and sat nav can be accurate down to fractions of a metre.

The signal can be degraded by; modifications to the satellites (ie, USgov messing with GPS, they did this to throw off some middle eastern types using gps in the desert a few years ago), atmospheric conditions meaning the signals take longer or are bent due to density changes and give false readings, and too few satellites meaning an accurate fix cannot be given, GPS covers most of the planet but the signal is very bad at the poles because most of the satellites orbit closer to the equator.

The risk in my mind is that drone strikes lower the threshold to initiate violence, roughly like adopting tasers has lowered the threshold to violence amongst some police forces. Bringing war closer to a video game is a fundamentally dubious move, and one that cannot be divorced from the vicious blending of the notion of militants with any male of a certain age in a region. There is a huge amount of fudging and falsification going on in official reports on the effects of the strikes, partly dissected [here](http://www.livingunderdrones.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Stanford-NYU-Living-Under-Drones.pdf), and that's to me part of a worrying trend of Western militaries re-establishing opaqueness over conflicts where with considerable toil some transparency has been established in recent decades. What are the implications for (mis-)informing the public when violence is so mechanized and remote? Can we embed journalists with drone packs?

Two recent examples where the police abused their powers are the Stephen Lawrence case and the union construction workers case.

Another example of the kind of thing that can happen with unchecked powers of surveillance - the attempted blackmail of Martin Luther King Jr. into committing suicide. It doesn't matter that GCHQ or the NSA might not take an interest in *most* people who really may have 'nothing to hide'. That they can do this to any single person should be of great alarm to us all.

We now have a situation where these people can store every single thing we do on the internet, and our precise locations throughout the day (using our expensive new personal bugging devices) and scroll through it all without even a warrant from a judge. And this came about not after a real debate over how our security services should operate, and what privacy means in the modern age, as is supposed to happen in a democracy. It crept up right under our noses, and anyone who told us what was being done to us was painted as a traitor and/or harassed by the security services.

If NSA employees are able to spy on their romantic interests (as they did in at least a dozen cases) without any oversight (most of the cases we know about were *self-reported*) then there is nothing to stop them from compiling detailed information on the communications and movements of a politician or activist - or even a judge making a ruling on the scope of the surveillance state's powers. If that doesn't scare the hell out of you more than a few dozen people being killed on a bus every decade or so then I'm not sure what to say.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I'm pretty certain terrorists do use both the internet and smartphones. Yes there is the potential for the abuse of power and that can have horrific consequences, but the potential for abuse alone is not enough of a reason to not implement something. 

Authorities do abuse power, and that must be called out and things must be done to try and prevent it happening again, but that doesn't always entail curtailing the power authorities have. Were the Stephen Lawrence case and union construction workers case related to GHCQ surveillance, or were they just an example of power being abused? I'm not defending abuse of power at all, and I know the handling of the Lawrence case by the police was awful, but in those instances reforms of policy are often implemented, to prevent power being abused again. 

It is alarming that there is the potential for such abuse of surveillance, which is why checks on the power are essential. I don't agree with the ""nothing to hide"" argument for the record, but again the potential of the power being abused is not enough to prevent the power being used at all, as long as checks are in place to address the possibility of it it occurring. 

&gt; If NSA employees are able to spy on their romantic interests (as they did in at least a dozen cases) without any oversight (most of the cases we know about were self-reported) then there is nothing to stop them from compiling detailed information on the communications and movements of a politician or activist - or even a judge making a ruling on the scope of the surveillance state's powers

That's a slippery slope; the potential for someone to do those things doesn't mean it will actually happen. IIRC, in terms of GCHQ at least there has to be a reason logged as to why certain data is searched or viewed, to prevent the kind of scenario you have mentioned possibly occurring.

I bet Mail readers secretly google some weird ass shit, like horrible things that would make them look really bad if they were to be dug out. I mean, they must search for some really hateful stuff.

Now, I don't think the data mining by the NSA is that important compared to how the information can be accessed by an actual living breathing human being. Say you get arrested under the suspicion of something you didn't do, but it doesn't matter because you're in custody. Then they pull up your personal file that you can't delete, even though it has some things in it you'd rather forget (did you have a haemorrhoid in 2005, or was it just something you'd eaten?). The police go through every strange looking website (and there are some really fucking strange websites in my history, I'll tell you that one) and build up a picture of you.

Not the picture of you you share with your friends though, not even your carefully crafted facebook profile. The *real* picture of you. All the worries you've used your search engine to ask about. All the problems you've had in your relationships but kept secret because you didn't want to do anything stupid. All the hopes you've had dashed by finding out, yep, someone else already had that brilliant idea of yours.

This builds up a really weird picture and ""bing bing bing"" the psychology test is in (which, correct me if I'm wrong, but has never been able to track every piece of information you've ever looked for, so probably isn't that accurate, but who will a jury believe, you, or an expert in criminal psychology who has been working with the police for 5 years?) says that you match the profile of a serial killer. After all, you watched that video of a tickle me elmo burning 15 times in two weeks. So the police investigator asks you *""Normal people don't look at what you look at, why aren't you normal?""*.

There is some dark shit in the bread crumbs of information you look at, if you can't connect the dots in the right way people could jump to some really weird and unfair conclusions about you. Mail readers can be hateful spite filled monsters but they aren't criminals, there is a big difference between someone that searches for *""how to get rid of all the polish/indian/muslim/black people on my street""* and someone that actually follows through with it.

I don't believe it is safe for the security services to have the capability it wants. They have already been caught lying and covering up their activity, so how can we trust them when they say there is sufficient oversight and regulation? Is there any follow-up when they fill out that form to make sure their snooping only covers that specific context? And who does that follow-up? An independent regulator, or court? In America they have a secret court meant to oversee the surveillance program, and even they have admitted they can only rely on what the NSA tells them. This makes them essentially useless. http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/court-ability-to-police-us-spying-program-limited/2013/08/15/4a8c8c44-05cd-11e3-a07f-49ddc7417125_story.html

The system they are building can be turned from something meant to 'stop terrorists' into a tool of the police state overnight. Perhaps there is a way to implement this in a way that is safe, but certainly not with the laws and the institutions that we have in place. 

&gt;the potential for someone to do those things doesn't mean it will actually happen

The risk that it will happen is reason enough to put a stop to it until we have a full and open discussion on how such a system can be implemented without putting civil liberties and privacy at enormous risk.

&gt;Not every foil of terrorist plots is publicly released either.

&gt;There have also been several terrorist attempts since the bus bombs, some of which were foiled by intelligence gathering, so it's not really a few dozen people being killed on a bus every decade. Not every foil of terrorist plots is publicly released either.

Who tells us this monitoring is essential? The security services. Who has an enormous interest in having this kind of monitoring? The security services. If they had their way we wouldn't know they could conduct this monitoring at all. Surely this is the real enemy of democracy.

&gt;I'm pretty certain terrorists do use both the internet and smartphones. 

Why would they, knowing what they know now? MI5 would have us believe that simply knowing that they may be monitored will cause them to take such great care in their communications that they can no longer be stopped.

Financially, I think overall there is probably little difference over a whole lifetime between renting and having a mortgage as usually (though maybe not right now in London...) renting is slightly cheaper than having a mortgage, so you can build up long term savings in the same way that you build up capital in the value of the property you own.

I thought nothing of it until an hour later when someone else arrived and mentioned that the van was still there. I went down to have a look as I vaguely knew the owner of the Alfa and asked what was going on... They'd changed the (alloy) wheel for the space-saver spare and 'something was ticking when the wheel rotated'. I immediately asked what size bolts they'd used as the spare was a lot thinner than the original wheel... sure enough he'd used the same bolts and they were too long. Sat next to him, in the box he'd removed the locking wheel nut key from, was a full set of short bolts for the spare wheel. 

Obviously I don't suppose all RAC patrols are this useless but if their recruitment process doesn't weed out the people who can't change a wheel... It's not a service I'd pay for.

The AA on the other hand I have a lot of respect for. Admittedly I have a friend who works for them but their recruitment process was extremely rigorous and the patrols have the discretion to do what they think is best for the customer, be that driving round for an hour to find parts so the customer doesn't miss their holiday or entirely ignoring the car and taking the customer to the funeral they were trying to get to then dealing with the car later.

But seriously, you're suggesting all human progress is directed at better ways of fucking things up. I'm sure you can be happy sitting in a cave, playing with stones, but I'm of the opinion that scientific progress is making life easier and happier for a larger group of people every day.

Yes, there are problems with businesses focussing on profit rather than the ""good"" of everyone everywhere, but the fact is, your chances of dying from cholera are considerably less now we have medicine and research.

Computers turning people into zombies - you're on Reddit! Also not all computers are used by humans directly. Think phone exchanges, power station and water utility monitoring, even the equipment used to detect pollution and climate change. Without all these, we wouldn't even know there is a problem until it was physically visible.

Malaria could be eradicated tomorrow if there were supply lines and some oversight capable of governing such an operation. This would require huge amounts of raw materials (science, technology), communication (science, technology) and manpower (fed by and maintained by...). You can't just jump to a cure.

As for the people working pointless jobs - people were doing that long before modern technology got in the way. Not a lot of logic and reason went into pyramid building. Still got done. Several times.

Historically the production and distribution of luxuries was far more unbalanced than it is today. As technology and trade has evolved over history, economists (using logic and reason, please don't confuse them with todays ass-hats) realised that a strong middle class was important, and created such a populous. This helped created a workforce that could decide what type of work they wanted to do, and allowed education to be more widely available.

Oil is required not only to produce food, but to transport it to people homes. If the entire planet were farmers, the soul destroying jobs you're pissed off with would be far more repetitive, and far more likely to kill or disable you. With the aforementioned logic and reason, we can stockpile food for times of hardship, and move product from high yielding areas to more disadvantaged areas, fast and efficiently. We can also protect people from the likelyhood of theft, including insuring against losses. More logic and reason.

[This](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587711003552) paper reviews the evidence and differences between the two environments.  

The fact that Irish culls seem to have reduced bTB incidence should not be used as evidence against our own cull trials specifically due to these differences.

true,barejokez,null,null,"the simple answer is that yes, there are several points in favour of owning your own home. however, that is not to say that it is the best thing for everyone:

* you can extend / redecorate as you please (within legal limits)
* you can't be given notice on the whim of a landlord
* you can also take control of any issues such as repairing a boiler without waiting for a landlord to get round to it (though you will have to pay)
* you can get a dog

It *probably* also saves money over the long run. i would be genuinely interested to know what the economic difference of renting vs owning is   over a lifetime, taking into account mortgage costs, repair costs, insurance costs vs rent. that would be really interesting.  i'd also like to know over what time period renting becomes a better option. that's quite a complicated question, but maybe someone somewhere has done a study?

Anyway, advantages of renting should also be considered (or even living for free with family/friends. there are some people who have spent their whole life in one house, for example). they include:

* flexibility if you want to move to a new location
* don't have to worry about maintenance costs or buildings insurance

Personally, I am fairly indifferent to the idea of bringing him in at the moment simply because of his age and the (as you said) we have Sandro, Capou, Paulinho and Dembele (not to mention Carroll coming back next season).  

On the other hand Pirlo is absolute world class and one of the top 10 players in the world.  He would bring something to the team that we have been missing; a deep lying playmaker who can be the midfield metronome setting the pace of the attack and he could serve as the type of veteran who can set an example to the rest of the team on what it takes to be successful at the highest levels of the game.

I think we would be better served by strengthening other spots on the squad but i don't see myself being broken up if we were able to sign Pirlo.  

Amazing as it is to say...Pirlo would almost be a luxury signing, no desperate need but brings a level of talent/experience to the team that we don't have.

NB: Numbers in 000's

* Readership = 4298 (second most popular paper in the UK, behind The Sun)

* Main demographic = ABC1 (@ 2756)

* Readership age breakdown = 624 @ 15-34, 3674 @ 35+

So strictly from this we can see that The Daily Mail is popular (although the industry itself has actually been in terminal decline for the last 4 years - ALL newspapers have been losing readers every year, with some at -8/10% YoY). People from the highest social groups are much more likely to buy it than those from lower social groups and it is much more popular with over the age of 35 than those under the age of 35.

I read these figures every few quarters, they used to actually be more detailed but I think you have to pay for that now. Anyway, based on my own anecdotal evidence (don't ask for a source because the source is my brain) - the Daily Mail is the most popular newspaper for those over the age of 65, and it is the most popular mainstream newspaper for women.

EDIT: just in case anybody notices, circulation and readership are different things. Circulation = how many copies sell, readership = total circulation multiplied by the average number of people who read each copy.

Example 1. Student is studying a demanding professional course, lets say, medicine. Such courses require a 100% pass rate to achieve the qualification, thus if you fail anything, and don't succeed on your 1 free resit, you fail the module and the year and have to repeat.

This initially sounds quite fair, you fail, tough. However, if you are from a wealthy background, you can afford the resit safe in the knowledge that in the end it will be worth it. If you are poor, then that's your one and only chance of further education over. Welcome to McDonalds.

Example 2. You have in the past gotten further education, say an open university course. You have decided that it is necessary to retrain in order to find a job, or that that open university course has now allowed you the grades/necessary knowledge in order to pursue  a proper degree. Unfortunately that open university course now counts against you as you are no longer eligible for funding towards course fees. 
 Now you are faced with staggering expenses if you wish to obtain that qualification, again not much of an issue if you are wealthy enough to afford it.

Thus at the end of the day, if you are poor, you get only effectivly one chance to improve your lot academically, but if you can afford the course fee's, then you can take as many stabs at it as you can afford, thus returning degree's, albeit slowly, back into the exclusivity of the wealthy.

The whole idea of tracking grades in comparison to previous years is why we are in this mess to begin with. Of course the real issue is that grades are meaningless. The grade focus is harming education more than helping it because teachers will teach to the test rather than just teach.

In light of it, the 1997 is effectively redundant.  The whole point was to provide a definitive, statistically powered study to answer the question of whether culling could impact bTB (for which badgers are an undisputable vector, although the fact that many other wild species are vectors, along with the role of cattle-to-cattle transmission, clouds the role of badgers in driving bTB).

Conclusions:
&gt; After careful consideration of all the RBCT and other data presented in this report,
including an economic assessment, we conclude that badger culling cannot meaningfully
contribute to the future control of cattle TB in Britain.

&gt; Our results indicate that while badgers contribute significantly to the disease in
cattle, cattle-to-cattle transmission is also very important in high incidence areas and is
15
the main cause of disease spread to new areas. The key aspects of reducing cattle-to-cattle
transmission are improved surveillance through more reliable, and possibly more frequent,
testing and control measures limiting spread through the movement of cattle between herds.
This is consistent with data from cattle pathogenesis and field studies. Our modeling work
indicates that implementation of cattle control measures outlined in this report are, in the
absence of badger culling, likely to reverse the increasing trend in cattle disease incidence
that has been a feature in GB for decades. It is also possible that more effective cattle
controls will lead to a decline of the disease in badgers, although the timescale for this is
likely to be slow.",0,1381325580,null,0,false,0,cco5770,t3_1o1eg2,t1_cco5770,t1_cco4hvh,null,1429192259,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

In terms of whether it saves you money in the long run, the only information I have found so far points towards the fact that it would lose you money or not make any difference. When i've got my research organised into a dissertation or a chapter, I will post this up for you to have a read through!

[this] (http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/business/buy-rent-calculator.html?_r=0) is a useful calculator to work out which is best for you. It's american but the same principles can be applied to the UK.

Personally, if I were to buy a house, I would be buying something really cheap and grotty and improving it to add value, not just assuming it would gain value with inflation. There are two type of ownership models: buying to sell for profit and buying for a home (and sometimes a combination of both)

Coutinho is going to get targetted in this league now people know what he can do, and Suso will be the same once he is back next year. It's important that we have multiple high calibre options all over the pitch, and Pastore would be ideal for me.

That sounds insane to me. The problems you mention are all caused by greed, inability to think for the long term, and other human flaws. Only logic and reason will solve them. 

The logical, reasoned thing to do would be to prevent and solve these issues, as scientists are currently attempting... but the solutions are not widespreadly being put into practice because it would significantly cost us now for no immediate benefit.

&gt;Money has been invested in space shenanigans that could have been used to eradicate malaria.

Technology isn't independent of each other. Without space technology (a far smaller expense than many other things, such as the military), who knows if eradicating malaria would even be possible?

All of the GPS satellites are synchronized, so they all send out the beacon message at the same time. Once the receiver receives at least 4 beacon messages, it can start to calculate position.

This is taken mainly from [here](http://www.pocketgpsworld.com/howgpsworks.php), combined with a Mobile Comms module I did in Uni a few years back, and a quick skim through the Wikipedia article, which turned up no reference to the receiver transmitting anything, and only to messages being sent *from* the satellites. 

I'd also hedge my bets on what I think, because the antenna on many GPS enabled devices is just too small and too weak to reach space before SNR gets too high. GPS operates on a similar range of frequencies to mobile phones (GSM etc). 2W (about 33dBm) is about the max transmission power from them, and they can barely travel a few miles. 

The path loss is roughly 182dB ( L = 20Log*_10_*(4πd/λ) where d=21,000,000M, λ=0.19029 ) at GPS frequencies from ground to satellite... And I've forgotten the maths from this point on.

No they wouldn't. Because exactly of that risk. You're not getting this, drones give government the chance to do something they otherwise might not do. Certainly not on the same scale. 

You really think the US would be spending so much more and risking so much more to bomb villages in Pakistan? If so why weren't they doing it before drones became widespread?

Drones make it cheap, easy and risk-free to commit mass murder. Like I said, if Assad had drones there would be much, much more air strikes happening in Syria then there is right now with his MiG's and killable pilots.

Without drones the US would be doing much less strikes around the world, and there would be less murder and bloodshed. They wouldn't simply be doing it instead with a fighter jet or cruise missile. If you really think that you're living in a deluded world.

Contrary to what some other people are saying, there certainly is such a thing as loyalty and gratitude to an employer. Only you know whether your current employer has earned that. 

But whatever the issue is, until you're offered a better job this is all irrelevant. And, presumably, if you're going to interview to try to get one, you'll pull together an argument for why they should hire you. Which would involve showing them how much you've done for your current employer. 

Well, what works for one works for the other. If you're offered the job, you now have a bargaining chip (so to speak). So if you feel you're not recognised by your current employer and you want to leave, leave. If you feel you owe them something, you're able to take that same argument - in whatever form you've created it: presentation, or whatever - and explain that you've done big things in 5 months and it's been noticed elsewhere. You've been offered x, not to mention a formal contract etc etc, and you feel that this is a great opportunity blah blah ad nauseam. 

If they're decent people and they can't match the package, they won't resent you moving on as long as you give them a reasonable amount of time to find a replacement. Set a date and explain that you have to be strict with it as you have to honour your new agreement. 

If they're not, and they're shitty with you about it, then bad luck... you've had your first unpleasant workplace conversation.

They're used on the battlefield, for reconnaissance, information gathering, surveillance - all the crucial parts of warfare which aren't avoided simply because of the risk, they can't afford to avoid them. Those are all things the government an already do, but they give them a cheaper, safer and better option. Drones have excellent loiter time compared to manned aircraft, much cheaper to operate and easier to service in the field.

You know what else can commit ""mass-murder""? Anything. Cruise missiles. Artillery. Bombers. It's nothing that hasn't been done before. You think Assad limiting himself because he's afraid of losing his aircraft? Of course not, he's using bloody *helicopters* to bomb people for goodness' sake.

Why weren't they doing this before drones were invented? What makes you think they weren't? They performed strikes on [neighbouring countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Menu) in the Vietnam war with manned aircraft - with fighter jets and bombers. They shot down [airliners](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_Air_Flight_655), and [civilian institutions](http://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2013/mar/12/gulf-ii-timeline-us-iran-encounters) in the Persian gulf. They even attacked [Libya in 198](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_United_States_bombing_of_Libya)6 with the loss of an aircraft and two airmen - yeah, looks like they really weren't running the risk before drones were around huh?

If you think drones are the only thing that's allowed governments to do anything like this, you ought to read more military history. It's been done for decades.

true,this_sort_of_thing,eng-GreaterLondon,London,"No, because the context is completely different. In this specific scenario, the drone war the US is having, is only happening because of the drones. Politically and economically speaking the US wouldn't be doing exactly what it's doing with drones right now, if it wasn't for the drones. The whole targeted killing/assassination program. Being able to constantly hover around North West Pakistan (or anywhere else) and bomb targets at will, these are things that ultimately are only being achieved because of the drone technology. Not that the US couldn't do it with other things, but they wouldn't do it with other things. Not in this scenario.

Drones allow a nation to potentially cause far more destruction for a much cheaper price, politically and economically. Like I said, it's about the grand strategy. The diplomacy. The politics at home. Which make drones a far more accessible option for governments than other more conventional means of bombings. Which is why they are generally seen as quite destructive in many circles.

Think about this. It's 1965. The US wants to blow up some house in Latin America for whatever crazy reason. Its options is an air strike or commando raid. Both of which are risky and politically sensitive. There's a much higher chance the US will simply not do anything due to this risk and thus nobody dies, for small operations such as this sometimes the risk outweighs the reward. Now fast forward to 2013. The US has a third option, send a drone out there. Suddenly the option of not doing anything is basically non-existent at this point. Blood will be spilt. The risk is negligible. The reward is great in comparison.",0,1381336381,null,0,1381336598,0,cco925f,t3_1o1iml,t1_cco925f,t1_cco8wnj,null,1429190458,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The key to this story is not that the police are investigating crime. Although some would argue intellectual property theft is not a crime, I wouldn't.   I do have concerns about the law describing it as  ""Serious crime"" however.

The key to this story is the police are sending out official looking letters to law abiding companies asking them to break a legal business contract with a UK citizen without having any authority to do so, and worse, they are asking them to essentially provide the names of any visitor to this legal website to be stored in a police database - **none of whom have broken the law by visiting the site** - even if they download a torrent link, that in itself is still not illegal in the UK.

That's not what I meant and you know it. Stop being a dickhead on purpose.

You're not bothering to read what I say. I'll post my example again:

Think about this. It's 1965. The US wants to blow up some house in Latin America for whatever crazy reason. Its options is an air strike or commando raid. Both of which are risky and politically sensitive. There's a much higher chance the US will simply not do anything due to this risk and thus nobody dies, for small operations such as this sometimes the risk outweighs the reward. Now fast forward to 2013. The US has a third option, send a drone out there. Suddenly the option of not doing anything is basically non-existent at this point. Blood will be spilt. The risk is negligible. The reward is great in comparison.

Drones allow the US to go after small targets that it otherwise would perhaps not go after. It opens up a whole new chapter of potential killing for them for reasons already stated. Hence why I say they wouldn't be using drones if they didn't have drones. They wouldn't be using anything. Not for these kinds of strikes. You keep bringing up conventional conflicts as examples of conventional hardware being used, but that's not relevant to the context in which drones are used.",0,1381337541,null,0,false,0,cco9jjk,t3_1o1iml,t1_cco9jjk,t1_cco9a1g,null,1429190199,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

For example, even Mo Farah, who has practically lived his whole life in Britain and has a British father has been called a ""plastic Brit"".

There's something very uneasy about scrutinizing the ""purity"" of national representatives and defining (for example) true Englishness. In the end, all athletes compete for themselves/for their team and all praise should be given to them - even if people on their couches feel a sense of shared achievement when their nation's representatives succeed. It is somewhat irrational to feel ""national pride"" for the achievements of professional athletes. 

If we achieve perfect ""purity"" and nation states compete against each other with 100% home-born, home-residing, home-loving athletes, what have we achieved? 
Now we can truly decide which nation produces the best people to [slide stones across a sheet of ice towards a target area which is segmented into four rings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curling) and thus makes the nation superior to others?

If by 'operate' you mean having the ability to access these sites, then sure - but there are already laws that govern the blocking of these sites by UK ISPs. The police here are going after a foreign organisation, rabbiting on about the law in the UK which doesn't apply to them unless they have some sort of connection with their services.

&gt; If I start ""oddspace's hitman company"" just outside of the UK's waters, and throw fishes really hard at people in the UK when I'm paid to by other people in the UK, do you think the UK are just going to let me carry on?

Hold up. Digital data transmission and physically assaulting someone are vastly different things in the real world and law. That to one side, your example really has no relation to what's happening here. You're comparing digital transmission to physical violence, and bringing a person into the country to carry out those acts.

The registration services are not based in the UK. They are not run by people in the UK. They are not operated in the UK. They could be perfectly legal where they are based. In addition, they have not been proved to be breaking any UK law through a court.
If the content they offer is illegal in the UK, you then block that content - in the same way that the person throwing the fishes should be denied entry into the country . The courts can do this *now* and with ease.

The same applies to drugs - they could be legal in other countries, but if you bring them into the UK you're breaking the law. This doesn't mean the UK has a right to go after those countries because you made the decision to bring them back.

&gt;It doesn't matter where I am, under UK law what I'm doing is illegal. 

**Exactly** - what **you** are doing is illegal, not what the registrars are doing necessarily. They are *not* getting the registrars to block access to the domain for people in the UK, they are wiping that domain out for everyone *in the world*. That includes places where that content might be legal.
We are playing world police in line with America and it's going to cost us a stupid amount of money to do so.

true,SlindsayUK,cnty-wales,Wales - Swansea,"The issue with unmanned drones is that they currently give a military force the ability to conduct a new form of asymmetric warfare. Specifically, it gives the Government the ability to *impose* war upon another society if they are not similarly armed while not experiencing the effects of being at war ourselves.

To put it another way, we can impose this state on others almost indefinitely without experiencing any of the major consequences of war (no loss of life, no *risk* of loss of life, no hardships for the civilian population, nowhere near the same costs). 

What we haven't done is sit down and think about what the other side of this warfare is going to look like. At the moment we are happy to use military tactics against these groups we don't like because we get to ""win"" using it but in the long run, then what? War has a lot of rules ingrained in it that we don't always think about but now with drone strikes we break many of them.

If destroying drones is beyond an enemies means or having a financial impact is beyond them then what do they do? Their tactics will evolve ins response  to this because to fight a war, you need to *kill* people. If the people we fight can't kill the millitary, where are they going to look next? Will they even be out of line? How would people on this sub feel if we heard that a member of the Taliban had crept into the bedroom or a drone operator here in the UK and slit their throat or they blew up their house?

Basically, we haven't thought out where this is going properly. We have almost totally removed the ability for people to fight back against us under the current rules but now we're sitting back relishing our victories not realising that (IMO) the rules are about to change and we aren't going to like them.

channel money and privileges to its client groups, in return for those
groups' past and future contributions to its expenses.

This is not recipe for good government, so after a few years of
unsatisfactory results the public vote in a different party which
proceeds to favour its own set of client groups.  Round and round it
goes.

agree.

'What's the point in calling the team Tottenham if it's got nothing to do with people from Tottenham?'  After a while I just realised it makes more sense to understand Football teams as businesses (because that's what they are).  That way it makes complete sense for anyone to be able to play for 'Tottenham' - because the region restriction is not applied, and the name just becomes a poetic relic of the origins of the league structure.  Tottenham becomes the name for that business, and the industry they work in is football.

That's why International football is different.  You couldn't have Zola playing for England... because he's from Italy.  Obvious.  That's what changes the 'slant' of the structure.  You don't have the freedom to try and create the perfect team, you just have to pick from a local pool.  I like it better, because I preferred the idea that you can't just buy the best team - which I think is pretty droll.  I think the 'quality' of the football is lower, because you just have a more limited pool of choice, but that's kind of what makes it more fun for me.  

If you can essentially buy players on the international scene (by opening the pool up to just - all the footballers in the world) - it doesn't make the scene any *worse* as such, it just changes what it's about.  It just becomes the same as league football - which is fine - just different.

If they decide it's actually fine to take anyone on to the national team now providing whatever minimum requirements of naturalisation are met - then after 10 years it'll be just like league football.  So they'd no longer be any point in having league *and* interntional football.

true,turdburglersc,null,null,"its only possible if you assume that its always possible to improve, that there is no hard limit on how much information a child can learn in a year.  and that even if there isnt, that the variance in average child ability for a year must be smaller than any increase, else the school could fail through no fault of their own.  

so even if its mathematically possible, schooling isnt as simply a question of teaching n amount of information there must be a limit on that.


secondly this reinforces the biggest critisism you see of the current school system, that they only teach to the test.  if a school is pressured even more by test results we will continue with the current trend of schools turning out high scoring but poor students. 

now obviously theres a huge debate about teaching methods you could have, but long story short most people agree that teaching just to pass a test is bad for the child in the long term, nothing this government (or the last one) has done to education has changed that.  so this is a bit of a circlejerk but behind that its also a stupid policy.",0,1381348052,null,0,false,0,ccoduv4,t3_1o2nl6,t1_ccoduv4,t1_ccoc1wv,null,1429188186,25,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,25
