His work rate is phenomenal, but he doesn't really threaten going forward and can disappear in the big games. 

I do like Montoya pick up as a solid future investment, he probably could even challenge for a starting spot right off the bat. We need to stop shuffling around our defense every game, everyone looks out of sorts back there.

Good midfields like Juventus's with Asamoah, Vidal, Pogba and Arsenals with Wilshire, Flamini and Ozil/Ramsay are all versatile players. They rotate, make runs when necessary, good defensively, decent passers, good on the ball. I realise these are all players we can only dream of buying at the moment, but buying players with all round attributes should be a priority rather than a specialist. 

Benayoun was exactly that, a versatile midfielder who could operate as a winger, number 10, central mid. Same with Raul Meireles, Albert Riera even Jonjo Shelvey. 
Henderson is the only one close to this at Liverpool at the moment. Lucas seems incapable of taking the ball past halfway. The number of times we have seen Gerrard lose the ball in the last 3 months is getting laughable.

Suarez has his head elsewhere and doesn't want to be here.  Johnson is, I believe, thinking about his likely departure.  Moses could care less about Liverpool.

Bench: Jones, Skrtel, Toure, Allen, Alberto, Moses, Sterling

- Agger/Skrtel is a toss-up. Skrtel's been great but it's time to settle that back four and I think Agger's the guy moving forward. Sakho needs to be playing.
- I don't give a shit if Gerrard thinks he's Pirlo or Alonso, he fucking isn't, especially as long as he can't even make a simple pass. Today, he couldn't connect on his ""Hollywood"" balls either. He doesn't have the energy or defensive acumen to press relentlessly and intelligently like we need. Henderson back there will bring out the best in Lucas. Gerrard further forward will create more chances, not like he and Torres created with power and pace but by picking out the runs of the forwards and fullbacks, whipping dangerous balls into the box. It's killing the team having those two flipped, despite how Gerrard wants to affect his legacy. If he won't take that personal hit for the team, put Alberto or Allen in that position. It won't happen, though. We'll continue to watch him and Lucas get overrun while Henderson creates nothing as an AM.
- With Suarez in a free role, playing off of/with another striker, we get the best out of him. If we get the best out of him, we win games. That's not to mention that I think he, Coutinho, and Aspas will link up beautifully and bring out the Aspas we thought we were getting.
- With our fullbacks pressing up (and Hendo covering), Suarez and Coutinho floating out wide, we'll get more width than Sterling and Moses gave us today.

true,S00L0NG,null,null,"Some better than me done a really good post about this,i will re-post it here (http://www.reddit.com/user/realslicedbread) 

This article, and the related ones in the telegraph, are such sensationalist bullshit it's hard to know where to begin.

First, if this woman was exhibiting psychiatric symptoms she would have been assessed by TWO independent doctors and an AMHP before being detained in a psychiatric hospital. (At least one of the doctors would've been trained in psychiatric medicine and an AMHP is a specialist social worker/nurse with additional training in mental health issues). Three separate professionals will have reviewed her case and felt it was in her best interests to be forcibly detained for assessment.

Initial detention is know as a ""section"" (from Section 2 of the Mental Health Act 1983) is for 28 days and the patient is closely observed for their behaviour, attitude and though processes. The Sunday telegraph article states that she was in there for 5 weeks before the C-section, and thus longer than the 28 day limit.

She must've been reassessed before the full 28 days for consideration for a section 3 - detention for up to 6 months with a view to treatment (as opposed to assessment in S2). This will again have to have been by 2 doctors and an AMHP. These orders last 6 months and need to be reviewed before they expire.

So far all the above will have been done by professionals with psychiatric backgrounds. As she was pregnant, senior obstetricians will have been involved too. Together they must've reasoned that a C-section was the safest way of delivering this baby. This may have been related to her mental state, maybe medication, maybe something else. There are many reasons a C-section was most appropriate for her in this instance.

If you are going to do anything to a patient you better read up on the Mental Capacity Act 2005, especially if you are going to put her under the knife. It's long and boring but the gist is that there is a legal statute giving guidance on how to define mental capacity, what to do when there is no capacity, and the people involved. Here is a pertinent part pulled from Wikipedia:

    Restraint is only permitted if the person using it reasonably believes it is necessary to prevent harm to the incapacitated person, and if the restraint used is proportionate to the likelihood and seriousness of the harm.

Note the word proportionate. If anything less than C-section was a viable and safe option for delivery, an operation would not have been performed.

Almost certainly an IMCA will have been involved too, since she will have been assessed as not having capacity and about to undergo surgery. They are Independent Mental Capacity Advocates, independent people there to speak on the patient's behalf. If everything was not 100% above board you can bet your life that that operation would've been halted by a judge.

Operating on someone who doesn't give consent constitutes assault - you can also safely bet the surgeon will have checked and cross-checked everything with his/her medical indemnity provider to make sure the operation was performed legitimately.

Finally the article states that a judge gave permission for the baby to be delivered by C-section. Every i would have been dotted, every t crossed; there is no way anything was left unexplored before submission to a judge requesting an operation on a woman without capacity.

Are you telling me a judge, senior psychiatrists and obstetricians, social workers, independent advocates, lawyers and healthcare staff all colluded to rip this woman's baby out against her will? And statues like the Mental Health Act and Mental Capacity Act implemented to protect both patients and caregivers? Give me a fucking break.

There is more to this story, but without knowledge of the case or experience in social work I can't really comment. However there are still things I feel are worth noting:

In many forms of mental illness (including bipolar disorder) patients will have poor memory of their actions and thoughts during the time they were critically ill. Partially due to improvement in their mental function, partially due to the medications used, partially due to the elapsed time to takes to recover. Often when they are well they have poor recollection of why they were detained in the first place. All of these articles seem to be based on what the woman is saying now (who is currently well and on meds), and her lawyer. No one else has been able to speak on the case, and rightly so due to privacy laws.

Social workers are incredibly hard working yet likely even more underfunded (and undervalued) than medics. Their caseloads are so heavy, a complex case like this may have taken up hundreds of man hours. It would take everything they have to sort out the issues with this ""foreign"" baby and it's mother in the UK alone, never-mind trying to cross borders and liaise with the Italian legal system and social services. And honestly are we expecting the notoriously fast Italian judicial system to come in and save the day?

And talk of this new guardian? The the mother's ex-sister-in-law? Who lives in America? The ex-partner isn't even the father of this baby. And not that the baby gets to live with a half-sister at least, but a woman with whom it has no blood relation, has probably never set eyes on this baby yet, and lives in fucking LA!? Could you imagine the uproar if the child did go to LA. ""Social services give British baby to unrelated American woman, despite backlog of parents wishing to adopt in UK"".

Everyone should be able to imagine the stringent and onerous vetting process prospective parents must go through to adopt a child. How the fuck is a struggling and overburdened social service supposed to vet this ""very capable mother"" and ""rock"" of a woman who lives 5000 miles away?

The system isn't perfect and often makes mistakes. It's rigidity (due to the huge number of regulations and stakeholders involved) makes rare edge cases even more difficult to handle. But let's not make out like the government is stealing this poor woman's baby from her. I'm certain everyone involved is trying to do the best for the woman and the baby.

true,thepancakebreakfast,lfc68,,"* Auburn alum here. Was there watching at Skybar. Best football game I've ever seen. There have been a few threads on reddit about this game with more background and context that y'all can explore, (including Stephen Fry's visit to Auburn for a previous Iron Bowl) but if you want to know anything about the game or the sport, don't hesitate to ask.


**Injection of Relevance Here**

I was talking to a friend of mine earlier tonight and he said he watched the game with a girl from South Africa and that it was her first time watching a college football game. This game was as insane as can be and is a serious candidate for best game ever played. He said the girl was overwhelmed with the whole experience. This reminded me of my first *football* football game I ever saw: 2005 Champions League Final. That game turned me from a stubborn ""that's not football, this is football"" American into a massive semi-rabid football fan and Liverpool supporter. The love that emanates from the fans, the sight of pure joy, and the culmination of unrivaled intensity hits you like waves in games like these. It helps illustrate to a wider range of people just how amazing sports can be, and what passion looks like and more importantly, what it feels like.

* By the way, College Football is the only sport in the same universe of intensity and awesomeness as Football. I'd advise you all to give it a shot. For Auburn/Alabama specifically, there is a great documentary on Netflix called ""Roll Tide/War Eagle"" that covers our rivalry, which is arguably THE best rivalry in (USA) sports.

I agree with nearly everything you said.  I don't know that Paulinho played a blinder really, but he made a difference simply by having another body up front willing to throw himself about a bit.  He has no idea how to play the #10 role however, so it was a mixed result.  I was kinda hoping to see Dembele up there instead.

Your comments about midfield triangles hit the nail on the head.  This season we've hugely lacked midfield penetration.  Our players just don't seem to know how to get between the lines to create problems yet.  Our positioning is too conservative.  Barcelona do this kind of keepsies all the time, but it works for them because:

a) They have the individual quality to keep the ball properly for long periods of time.

b) They constantly look to stretch the play and keep the ball moving across the pitch back and forwards.

c) They have players constantly looking to make killer runs and passes.  Even when they don't take these options, there are still options being created and opposition players are being drawn out of position.

Holding onto the ball with no one making runs or finding intelligent space is an exercise in futility.  At least today we seemed to move more fluidly than I've seen us do this season.  Still a long way to go however.

Lennon was terrific too.  He worked because he's a natural winger... he can threaten to go outside and cross with his right foot, but he can switch it up and run diagonally cross-field too.  Townsend can't do this when he's played inverted, and nor is his decision making as good.

Britain Privatize, keep infrastructure, don't bother to break up infrastructure.

The trouble is british telecom is the main monopoly so it's not a free marketplace at all. The process of unbundling the exchanges was only a show and worse still where that hasn't happened what you get is rebranded bt package sold through another provider, or the same through bt.

Why this is a scandal, a privatised monopoly is not a free market system and should not be treated as such. It offers an unfair advantage for whatever business holds it and poor value for the taxpayer, who not only paid for building the telecoms system of britain but then see it given part and parcel to one company instead of said system being rented out to virgin,bt etc for a fee. 

This system used by almost every other country ensures that the infrastructure of Britain is well maintained and more than paid for in fact making a profit for the government.

I didn't get to watch the first half but the heatmaps show that Oscar, Juan and Nando spent quite a bit of the first half in close vicinity - most of it in the right attacking third.

Bringing Lamps and Ba on seemed to spread the play and allow a little more stabilize type to the formation and fluidity to the game. Lamps usually occupies left of center midfield. With Oscar off, Mata and Ramires worked on the right of center midfield, Hazard worked the higher left flank with his dribbling, while Ba &amp; Torres harried the Saints CBs constantly.

With Oscar gone, Mata had more freedom to explore the pitch. In fact, his second half average positioning puts him almost next to Ramires in a CDM-ish role. His desire to track back defensively was quite evident but not always successful. Still he managed to do what he does best a lot of the time - get off peaches of through balls, crosses and defense-splitting passes.

TL;DR: Bringing on Lamps in place of Oscar, allowed Mata to play with more freedom and a more 'central' role in the second half.",0,1385967244,null,0,false,0,cdrkezc,t3_1rul0e,t1_cdrkezc,t1_cdr1h54,null,1428430141,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

Solar and wind have peaks, as your piece admits and I doubt you'd disagree with. During those peaks you don't let the energy go to waste, or try to store it as electricity in batteries, as that would be impractical. But using it to compress air and store that in tanks, which would be far safer than gas - and again, as your piece says, the marginal cost of doing this would be zero once infrastructure is in place, and it can be used to generate electricity by driving small turbines to make up any shortfall during trough periods.  

No extra new technology is needed to do this, and it's safe and clean and removes the reliance on imported fossil fuels and it would be cheap and easy to implement.

We aren't in a position to not play our best XI. Ok, Sturridge is out with an injury, I don't understand why the hell Coutinho is on the bench, and while Toure isn't too bad, how can we justify starting him over Sakho who was one of our best defenders along side Skrtel, and Agger is still much better as well. I honestly cannot believe that we started Moses + Sterling, why the hell is our BEST link up player on the bench? Was he injured? He came on and was by far our most threatening player.

I think now people will begin to realise that we actually have a paper thin squad when it comes to attacking options that we want to play. Lets look at City and Chelsea. City have Aguero, Dzeko, Nasri, Navas, Silva, Negredo and Milner (kind of). Chelsea have Ba, Torres, Hazard, Mata, Schurrle, Oscar and Willian. 

We have Suarez, Sturridge and Coutinho, some may argue Moses, but he ain't done shit since his first match. Aspas is crap, and we don't have the freedom to give him more time, we NEED points. Sterling is still far too young and inexperienced, has failed to make a reasonable impact. Luis Alberto, again, we CAN'T be bringing on players like this, a kid who while decent, hasn't scored/assisted in the prem, has little experience, and lets be honest, isn't that great (sure the potential is there, but thats not what we need or want). 

We need some signings next month, some good ones. We can't put on performances like these against mediocre clubs regardless of how well they play and expect to make top 4. These are where the points are at.

Some may argue that we were unlucky in this match where we let in 2 deflected goals, and without a doubt we were in that respect, however we played poorly overall, couldn't create many good chances, unable to press or penetrate, and there were a handful of 1v1s with our Mignolet because we were caught out. I am worried that if we play like this against City, we will be down 5 or 6 goals.

         Coutinho
    Lucas/Gerrard/X
    Enrique/X Skrtel Sakho Johnson

Mainly, we need depth. I feel that Suarez/Sturridge/Coutinho is strong enough up front. However, we DO need subs ready to go in all these spots. Another striker to rotate between Suarez/Sturridge, another player able to take over for Coutinho as well, maybe a solid Winger to come on for Henderson.

I'm not so sure about Henderson, I feel he can start and that is ok, but we probably need another player to really give him some competition, he is not consistent enough, and having another player get game time over him based on form will be better for both us and him.

I'm ok with Lucas/Gerrard, and I do feel that Suso can come in for Gerrard in the coming years, while we probably need back up for Lucas as he plays a position that is susceptible to suspension and injuries.

We need someone else to come in for Enrique when he is out..Cissokho is crap, and Flanagan is alright, but won't be anywhere near good enough IMO for at least a couple years. I'm happy with Skrtel/Sakho/Agger as our two central defenders.

I'd like backup for Johnson, he is good, but I think he needs competition..

Aspas/Cissokho are both shit, Luis Alberto isn't a player we can use (too young/inexperienced and we NEED points) often. Sterling is a confusing one. Moses is shit, but I think its ok for him to be on the bench.

Even then, it's damaging Scotland's for self subsistence, and forcing it to rely on money given to it by London; that's not economically healthy.

If the government's goal was to make jobs and money in the North and for Scotland,then they should be investing directly in regional projects, infrastructure and urban renewal. But their goal is not to make money for the North, and certainly not for Scotland; but to make money for Greater London; billions, even in the worst case scenario.

I'm not entirely sure that Westminster is *deliberately* doing this (which, frankly, is an even more worrying idea) but HS2 just doesn't look to be a very effective way for making money for anywhere other than London, and Birmingham. There are better ways to invest the money.

I think where you are seeing inconsistency (tell me if I've misunderstood you) is in the sequence of events? But I think that seems to rest on your idea that the moment time locked the war at a particular point in time, which isn't really how it would work...timey wimey and all that. As an example, Dalek Caan broke the time lock to rescue Davros, but that was from the first days of the Time War IIRC. So its actually the whole Time War that was time locked - IE you couldn't change the course of history - not that anyone was physically trapped. . The only possible inconsistency I can see is that the Seer time lady in TEOT prophesieed that Gallifrey would burn, but I reckon that's where Bad Wolf/the Moment and the multi drs and Clara changed things, which therefore isn't a contradiction as such, just changing the future..

I feel like a bit often we tend to jeer because Lamela isn't starting, or because Ade didn't get a run out, when actually, Soldado and Lennon had very good games.

Often on /r/coys, we can praise the obvious, Walker, and miss out on those who really make the game tick, so I wanted to highlight the fact that Lennon was key in all of that. Especially in giving Walker the confidence to come forward, knowing Lennon could cover defensively.

Paulinho wasn't a stand out player that game, but he did press well and link up nicely. He also just acts as a body in the box, which always helps and is something we just haven't seen enough.

If I have to criticise Soldado, it's because we tend to see him drifting near the edge of the box, when we want him to get stuck in. Walker is great at making those sharp, fast crosses along the 6 yard line, and if Soldado would get into those danger zones, we may seem more goaldados. It's something van persie, negredo, giroud do really well.

Oh yeah, and Chiriches gave away the ball too much. Vertonghen was caught out of position too much. Both of which left us vulnerable. (Had to say those ones at the end because /r/coys adores them!)

Only when Oscar came off and Mata given the keys that he showed what he can do. Hazard also seems to work better with Mata. The difference I have noticed with Oscar and Mata, is Mata is more decisive with the ball, quickly attacking. Oscar likes to see what develops and then decides what to do. 

To be perfectly honest, Mata is never going to be a as good of a defensive player as Oscar is. For me, that's perfectly fine. Nobody is complaining about Xavi being a liability. Does Chelsea not have Lampard as a defensive midfielder? Lampard doesn't exactly ooze of defensive prowess either. Have a solid foundation and it shouldn't be a problem.

That said, travelling east, you'd probably find similar levels of support in the Estonias and Lithuanias of this world, in spite of a lack of real benefits to their memberships as a result of the ""brain drain"" on their economies from emigration. Poland, again, is a different case - their own economy, thanks partly to the Euro 2012 projects and partly to their increasing role as an offshoot of the German economy, has picked up and many are going back for work now, but without those big projects the open door risks doing more damage to the ""emigrating"" nations than the welcoming parties. It's still nigh-on impossible to find a worker with practical skills east of Berlin.

Finland did.  Quite recently too.

Similar deal in the French and Finnish governments extended loan guarantees.  It's an easy and effective way to attract private investment.  It's pretty much just a green light to potential investors to say this project is going ahead.  A similar thing as to when capital was put up by Westminster for the new Green Investment Bank in Edinburgh, only that wasn't just a loan guarantee but actual capital.  Private investment will  take the lead.  EDF have already begun drawing private investment and sharing private, non-socialised risk.

Big projects like these need a catalyst, and that's all this really is.

As for perhaps investing this loan guarantee to renewables, this is baseload energy.  We desperately need baseload, renewables don't provide that.  Baseload is the uniform demand below peaks and troughs and it's currently either gas, coal or nuclear.  They're closing coal powerstations and gas is becoming more expensive.  You can either lower the baseload by increasing efficiency or lowering demand but no amount of renewables will currently meet it with the technology we have available.

I'd much rather have an under-performing Agger and a solid defence than a Skrtel playing out of this world and an un-organised back four.

I do agree that Lucas hasnt been great in the last couple of games, I think part of that is to do with the fact that every time we take the ball over the half way line the players brains turn to mush and the ball comes back just as quickly. He cant stop *every* attack that comes our way, and the fact that we seem so bad with the ball in the opposing half means that whoever we play get tonnes of chances to run at us.

Sterling on the left because he gave Figueroa a hard time for most of the match until Brady could help him. Imagine Johnson up against Figueroa. He'd have beat him 9/10.

Henderson to push up and help Cout/Suarez.

If it is complex, I'm in awe of the effort and skill and designing it and pulling it all off. (Of course if the illusion is shitty or easy to see then I'm not in awe in the first place.)

true,topright,logo4,,"A few things to add... you'll be getting a train from Euston to Manchester Piccadilly. The carrier is Virgin Trains. They run every 15 mins and generally take 2hr05mins to 2hr30mins. 

The standard cost is about £75 but you can get great deals on their site if you book in advance traveling out of peak time. 

Beware the difference between Advanced Off Peak and Off Peak. The former means you can only travel on the specific train you booked for. That sounds like a good idea to save £££ but you'll have to pay for another standard ticket if you miss your train, wiping out any saving - and then some- you may have made.

You can walk to the stadium from Piccadilly. It's only a mile or two and the nearer you get to the ground the bigger the buzz as the crowds grow. I walk from The Smithfield- a City pub- a bit further away and it really builds the excitement for the game.

There's a fan zone at the ground open for business before after the game with beer and food and various bits of entertainment going on. It's the closest you'll get to tailgating in the UK. This is also right by the club shop which gets horribly busy on match days.

The obvious pub to go to near the ground is Mary D's. It's a City oasis but fuck it gets busy so it's not always an option.

There's loads of pubs in town to watch the game at if you can't get a ticket but be warned... if City are playing at home United are away so any ""neutral"" pub will have reds. Generally it's alright but trash talking is not welcome in the UK and it will not go down well. We're all mancs together until comes to football and there's always one dickhead who has had too much drink and not enough love from mummy. I wouldn't bother wearing a City shirt if you're watching in town.

That said, I'm very proud of Manchester and we're generally a welcoming bunch- you'll find Manchester much more welcoming than London- so I'd urge you to take some time to have a look around and maybe spend a night in town. 

It's a good party town with loads of bars and nightclubs and a great music scene. The Northern Quarter is probably the best place to go for bars. Just hit up Thomas St and find one you like the look of.

There's also a shit-ton of history in Manchester thanks to advances in industrialisation- birth place of mass industrialisation, engineering- first ever passenger railway, chemical engineering- birth place, computing- first computer and social welfare- Das Kapital was written by Marx while in Manchester.

Do you honestly believe there is not a case to make for equality in Video games?

Do you honestly believe that the feminine issues are not issue at all?

Why?

You may not agree with Trope vs Women in Gaming, but having people debate things about the video game industry is an important part to bridge the gap between games and the rest of culture.

There is a reason people look down on you for playing 60 hours of GTA, but have watched all 90 hours of the LOST box set. Your hobby is still outside of mainstream culture and is catching up quickly. The US lawyers and judges cannot bring the hammer down on the whole industry, but we can look into improving the image and variaty of the gaming industry.

Before the indy-boom, can you say you didn't get board of games being about a blank character white man with a gun, in the early to mid days of last gen (360, PS3) it feels the only difference between many titles was the type of gun you were holding and the landscape:

* The mass-effect mass accelerator sniper riffle at the backwater planet. 

* The Fall-out mini-nuke launcher in the wilderness which was the Capital of the USA.

* The M-16 of a solider in Modern Warfare through the backstreets of old soviet cities.

* The Gravity Hammer welded by Halo's Master Chief on a planetary-sized, life-destroying mega structure.

* The Bee-launching plasmid with steam-punk Gatling gun of Bio Shock's underwater dystopia.

All these brilliant games have **very** different feelings and settings and story types and mechanics, but strip them all down and the entire industry was white-man with guns, usually in 1st person.

Game developers didn't want this, they wanted a larger variety of different stories to be told, and more and more publishers would seek to make them streamlined to the standard. Players wanted this too.

Why not give exposure to someone who is advocating for a change in the way games are designed. This wont stop the Call-of-Duty's being made, won't stop the big games coming out but may put a bit more diversity in triple A game industry.

The article doesn't really go into enough detail to easily tell, but it seems like the issue might be favouring one type of energy (nuclear) over others. The major issue here seems to be Germany and Austria refusing to allow nuclear to be subsidised as non-carbon, which is ridiculous.

Regardless, EU law is based on proportionality and allows anti-competitive approaches (subsidy) if it has the effect of promoting competition. There is all sorts of ways they could find in favour of the Hinkley Point deal - it could easily be argued that promoting nuclear has the effect of encouraging competition within the British energy industry, for example.

So Jose is left with the choice of favoring a CAM that can press or one that can create as good as any in league and probably the world.

I never really used the term carer - I guess foster parents sounded nicer to me.

Over about 7 years we looked after probably around 100 children - many were short term emergency care so we only saw them once and we had a big house so if there was a big family of children  for emergency care then we'd take all of them - we didn't want to see children split up. I think 7 was the most (2 families of children who were together) - that was an interesting few days!

We did a lot of respite care as well - have some children for a weekend a month to give other carers or parents a break.  I liked this best and became very close to my foster brothers and sisters. Of course this had to end at some point and that was very hard for me. 

That was one of the times when a social worker upset me - she called the house and my parents weren't home so rather than call back she left a message that the next weekend was to be the last visit of 2 children and then hung up.  It clearly didn't occur to her that as a child (about 12 yrs) I might be attached to the children who'd be visiting us for years. 
She was a bad egg but shes still very much part of social services and well rather high up for what I can tell - she doesn't think of the children in care or the carers or even colleagues from what I hear. The fact she is still a social worker is one thing that really bothers me.

Pretty much every child who visited fitted in well - I can remember the one who didn't - she was the same age as me and we clashed. She only came once or twice.  But it worked best if there was a gap in ages - when I was younger - I was 7yrs old when we started - we had lot of teenagers so I was the younger sister and many of them were lovely to me! As I grew up then we had younger children so I was the big sister and I could look after them - take them to the park and things.  

Every child was special to me and it was hard when we stopped but it was right time - I was 15 yrs old and needed the time to focus on school.  

Also our last child was an emergency care child who ended up staying for years.We would have kept him for life but we needed some support - I needed some support. He was an child who'd been through so much and he was very difficult. We did argue - like a brother and sister really but I needed time away from him but his social worker (same as the previously mentioned one) refused to allow respite (although she allowed it for his carers after!)
 We were so close and saying goodbye broke my heart. And seeing how he turned out aftet being passed from family to family after us and now from what I hear he turned out in the worst way because of it. Because budgets were more important than looking after a childs best interests.  

As a foster sister I didn't get any of the support offered to young carers - Don't  get me wrong - my parents were a massive support but it would have been nice to talk to someone else sometimes.

 The things you hear from the children - they'd often speak to me about what happened to them, the abuse,  - you can't cry in front of them, must be the strong one but rushed down to my parents after some of those conversations. After that my parents would tell me some of the children's background so I could be a bit more prepared about what the children might say. 

It is nice to occasionally hear about my foster family growing up and being ""normal"" and having been able to put their past behind them. 

I took part in a few schemes to talk to the children of future fosters but they never didn't anything after this.

Sorry kinda rambled there - I guess my main bit of advice would be to have a support group for the children of foster parents - once a month maybe have some adults they can talk to and then also to each other.  Maybe take them bowling or something so there's an activity going on.

Give them someone to talk to - Don't just offer it as I doubt they'd say yes but I'm sure they'd talk to someone if they were there.

true,steefen7,null,null,"Honestly, I know that Jose's chosen style for this team is heavy pressing and winning the ball back before it reaches our back line, but we clearly saw tonight that we can win without needing to do that. We were winning 2-1 before injury time and it could have been a lot more. 

In the defense of Jose's team choices so far this season, Mata has been inconsistent and less than stellar in his chances before last night save the Arsenal game. Oscar has really shown his work ethic, but we last saw last night exactly what Mata can do. Yes, he can't win the ball back as well as Oscar at the moment, but he brought calmness and composure to the attack and showed that he can send in a good ball from pretty much anywhere in the attacking third. Oscar hasn't shown that. 

Everyone is talking about Mata's game like the assists were merely on par with the importance of his defensive liabilities, but without those passes we don't win the game (at least not in the same way). If anything, I think Mata made the case for more rotation within the our central attacker slot, which I think is a good thing. We have a lot of depth all across our attacking midfield and there's no reason we should tie our hands by saying that the central attacker can only be Oscar. Oscar has shown that he can play an insane amount of matches,  but that doesn't mean it's healthy or good for him. 

I thought he played pretty well and showed a lot of what he lacks and what he has in abundance and the end result was a win, which is all the really matters.",0,1385989495,null,0,false,0,cdro88l,t3_1rvp15,t1_cdro88l,t3_1rvp15,null,1428428350,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

It's just an internet comment, a small string of 1's and 0's somebody bashed together in half a second on a virtual world that doesn't really exist. Words can't describe how meaningless it is. It's like walking down the street and seeing a little strip of paper with ""*Fuck you, cunt*"" written on it. It shouldn't make you cry. Are you really such a weak minded person that an anonymous comment collapses your world? Come on.

If you don't like it, don't read it. Especially on Twitter, you don't *have* to follow the cunt.. it's not like he's on a plynth outside the bloody pub. Or write an equally meaningless comment back. None of it matters. Not only that but **wishing for something doesn't actually effect reality you precious fuckwits**. If I hope all the children die in fires tomorrow it **doesn't make it more likely**, I'm not actually causing anything.. you're just a fucking idiot.

You can block him, you can get Twitter to ban him or you can take the most effective route and stop letting the stupid meaningless shit other people say have such a dramatic effect on your life *because that's the reason they do it*. You're just making it worse for yourself, you're painting a big target on your back and telling the world that if they say nasty things on t'internet you'll go off the bloody rails. *""I'm a bear and I'll go mental if you poke me with a stick*"". What the fuck do you think is about to happen? *poke*.

""*Don't feed the trolls*"" was correct in 1993 and it's correct now, they exist *because you completely over-react to the things they say*. They find it funny that you let it bother you, they understand how uncontrollable and lawless the internet is, they understand how all information on it is treated equally and how **you need to be your own content filter**.

Also, his message might be offensive but it's just as fucking pointless as all the people in all the places who type *""My condolences""*. It's just fucking babble to make us feel better, do we really need to all get together and tell each other just how tragic a helicopter crashing into a pub is? I'm sure we all fucking know, call it instinct. He's just not joining in on the national circlejerk of sadness, instead he's attacking it. Boo fucking hoo. You don't get to be right just because you claim you are more honest, solemn, charitable or polite than other people that's fucking stupid.

*""I'm really nice to my granny and you're not, therefor my stance on healthcare is correct. I really honestly deep in my heart of hearts believe it to be true also, so that that makes me double correct!""*. That's not how it works shitstain.

Call him an arse, shun him from society, spread rumors that he's got nasty diseases.. fine.. He's a cunt but I will defend his right to be a cunt until the day I die because at some point all this moral majority shite will turn on something you like, you'll have the minority opinion, you'll be the 'horrible' one and I hope someone will stand up for your right to be different from everyone else.

I could place a link right here in this comment to imgur and until *you* click it and *you* see the contents you won't know if it's cute or disgusting. That's powerful, it's the first time in human history we can really do that. Newspapers, TV shows, Books, Music.. they all have editors. They all have people smoothing the edges off reality to make it palatable. Not anymore. We have accidentally invented near absolute free speech, I can almost literally beam an idea from my brain to yours, with no interruptions, no judgements, no filters and with no information lost.. how amazing is that? Yet these fuckers want it taken away because *""that man said a nasty thing""*? Fuck them.

true,devineman,logo,,"I thought Navas had a really good game and our defending lacked cohesion and communication.

Navas' off the ball movement was brilliant and the Swansea defence were shit scared of him.  Every time he changed his pace in a countering situation they absolutely went to pieces at the back and scrambled around to try and deal with the problem.  He picked and chose the right moments when to do this to allow his mates more thinking time on the ball.  One of those ""when you do something right, it's like you've done nothing at all"" deals.  Watch the game again and watch how many ""false starts"" he made, it was beautiful to watch and an absolute nightmare to defend against.  Navas played the role of a guy who is about to punch you in the face but keeps faking it.  After a while you just become a snivelling wreck, unsure about how to defend.

I thought our defence was schoolboy yet again.  The communication and leadership aspect just isn't there at the moment and they end up sitting way too deep.  Neither Panti, Lescott or Demichelis is taking on the domineering role and it isn't the job of the fullbacks to determine the height of the defensive line.  This is one of the reasons why Shelvey essentially had a shooting practice training session in the first half; because the gaps between our defensive line and our midfielders was WAY too much, purely because of how deep we sat unnecessarily.  I also think that their positioning is often dodgy.

Realistically our defence concedes far too many opportunities and we've ridden our luck in that respect for the entire season.  I can't remember the last time City conceded so many chances that went begging, probably in the Keegan season in Division 1.  We're blessed that the teams that have come up against us have had a severe lack of quality up front or this season could have been very different.  Replace Shelvey, Walters, Aluko, Ameobi and Mirallas with players with a bit more quality and our season goes from ""happily third"" to ""bottom half"".  

This season we've only been faced with quality teams who haven't gone to pieces twice; and Bayern and Chelsea both beat us.  We have no right to be happy with our defending this season and again we allowed players time and space to carve out excellent chances.  We're lucky that early on in the season the league is so jumbled and everybody is still trying to find their feet, including ourselves, but if we don't sort this out quickly it will cost us in the long run.  

I also think that the excuse of blaming it on injuries is short sighted and lazy.  Firstly, we didn't look any better when Kompany was in the team and secondly, Demi and Lescott are both highly experienced and professional defenders who have played at the highest level for a decade.

There are effectively three competing models of retirement going on in the world. All of them very expensive. State pensions. Private savings. Property. Two of these are directly paid for by the young for the benefit of the retired and retiring. Direct savings is a proportionate system where the person taking the pain is the person benefiting. Right now Britain has a skewed balance between these things where my generation is facing the prospect of going entirely down the savings route while propping up a generation that went for both property and pensions at the same time.

She's the former partner (six years) of notorious sectarian butcher [Stevie ""Top Gun"" McKeag, Adair's most prolific hitman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_McKeag) who killed 13 innocent Catholic civilians including pharmacy worker Philomena Hanna, who often supplied medicine across the interface. After shooting her point blank in the face about ten times, he inexplicably started singing ""follow the yellow brick road"" whilst making his getaway. McKeag was himself murdered when he made threats against Adair after Tracey started sleeping with Adair too (if you've got the book Mad Dog by Lister and Jordan, [you'll see this on pages 295-297](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aKzB6O2Nli8C&amp;lpg=PT222&amp;dq=tracey%20coulter&amp;pg=PT222#v=onepage&amp;q=tracey%20coulter&amp;f=false)).

If she's going to lie down with dogs, then she can't expect to not catch fleas. She is absolute white trash, deserving of no sympathy whatsoever. This intimidation by her father's organisation, whilst unjustifiable, should perhaps make her sympathise with the victims of both UVF and UDA thuggery, who she has associated with so closely in the past, and make her question why she maintained links with such wankers.

I made no mention of equality, or my position on the portrayal of women in video games. I believe both of them are issues, but I don't believe it's a problem of gender, but of diversity. Be it female, fat, thin (skinny), black, hispanic or asian, there's a lack of diversity in our protagonists.

My problem was purely with the exposure given to Sarkeesian, whose interest in equality is non-existent and whose interest in womens issues (if any, is counter-productive) pale in comparison to her interest in self-promotion and profit. She's essentially an internet troll who conned $160k out of people to make a video series that presents a legitimate issue that's poorly/stupidly argued and wrapped up in troll-bait, resulting in the fount of hatred and attention she so desperately craved.

Realistically all this money should be spent and none of it should be placed in savings or used to service debt, though this is hard to monitor and it shouldn't be monitored unless its causing problems. Debt collectors, for example, could never demand this money. Everyone would have it, ex-criminal, stay at home mum, millionaire, drug addict, pensioner it doesn't matter.

If you're worried about people not doing anything all the time because they can go for a free ride, well, this is the society we already live in - the richest people are speculators who's rarely actually put their labour into anything that fixes the problems associated with society.

It wouldn't make people lazier, as well, because all the minimum wage jobs would have to be staffed and if people weren't staffing them the price of luxuries would go up. 

Student loans would be removed as it would easily be enough to live in a shared house or dorm. For luxuries students would probably have to take jobs over summer (or just get more money from mum and dad). (If we made education free again, anyone with the necessary qualifications could get 

As labour would be very difficult to coerce people into, the more hated jobs would have to provide incentive for people (as would highly skilled jobs). This would probably push up the price of luxury goods as most of these are moved around by people that probably hate it.

There would be no need for a retirement age, people would work for as long as they wanted to and those that were especially sick could still get benefits if they could reasonably demonstrate that they were needed; which is considerably better than it is now.

true,ggow,null,null,"To be fair, &gt;10% is a bit blunt though a reasonable approximation. Simple approximations are easy to collect and offer more reliable data. Defining fuel poverty as your energy bill pushing you below the poverty line is a much better definition and relies on only the same pieces of data. What's your gas bill, what's your income. 

The average part of it? I do not understand that at all. The calculation isn't all that difficult though, it has been routinely collected for a long time. Perhaps it's a crude way to account for the fact that, as fuel is considered separately, the poverty line should be lower in this calculation. (A poverty line which accounts for everything you need minus fuel has to be lower than one that accounts for everything you need.)


If this is a genuinely better definition, which I think it is, save for the 'average' aspect, then this is good public policy. Articles like this retard the implementation of good policy because they get flak for it. Another example would be the immigration figures. It does not make sense to count international students in net migration figures as their residence here is temporary but removing them would bring a political shit storm down on the heads of anyone who dared to do it Subpar policy because of the media aspect of politics. 


EDIT: The article has an explanation for the average at the bottom. 

&gt;According to an MPs’ committee, the new definition will move more 800,000 households out of fuel poverty, as many poor households are smaller than average and cost less than average to heat. This means that even if heating costs a significant part of their income, a household still won’t technically be “fuel poor” because the amount it needs to spend to keep warm is still below average.

The logic is if you're spending less than average, but fuel moves you below the poverty line, then you're not fuel poor but poor. It might seem like semantics but from a public policy perspective it's a worthwhile inclusion. Measures to reduce fuel poverty will not affect them (tax rebate? they barely pay any fuel tax as is. Insulation coupons? Their energy bills are already low, probably have efficient homes already.) because they aren't fuel poor. Other policy instruments is needed to help them. What those are depends on your ideological bint. Reduce taxes, more growth, rising tide lifts all boats and all that on the right. Wealth taxes, more welfare, welath redistribution on the left.

I have some criticisms on this sort of thing (not on any kind of moral ground and I don't find any of it offensive) but I don't like the idea of someone creating programmes and comedy routines based solely around a disability. Sometimes it comes across as someone with the disability laughing at the disability itself and it being acceptable because they're doing it and it allows others to share that without it being taboo or offensive. The problem with that IMO is that its still people laughing because someone is different. I have a disability myself and I can see that funny things happen as a result and I can joke about it and joke about the issues it causes however when you get to the point where your just laughing at the fact that you're different it starts to define you as a person. I know this from personal experience as right up until the end of 6th form I was the butt of every joke and thought even if it wasn't related to me or my disability because hey roblevmil is that different guy wouldn't it be funny if he was in this ridiculous situation. 

Anyway I'm going on a bit but my main point is that this kind of show has potential to be hilarious. I'm sure your friend is a funny person otherwise he wouldn't have gotten to this point. So if it's filled with jokes and funny situations resulting from his disability then I'm sure it will be great however if it's just a kind of 'he's doing something we''re not supposed to laugh at but it's now okay to do so' sort of affair then I see it kind of wearing a bit thin.

In-case you hadn't noticed the world was a savage brutal place, no matter which country, place island you were in.
The world was not peaceful. in fact it was in constant wars were women and children were raped simply because they lived in another country.

What the British did, with they're intelligence, advanced military equipment, and idea and what ever else. was first to trade with other nations, and build a massive navy in order to protect ourselves.
prior to our indusrialisation, were were under constant attack from the french, germans, picts (norway) and the scots.

constant plundering of this island, men were killed and your daughters got it worse!

what England did was fight back, and by fucking god it did it well.

there were no ""friendly"" places back then. you either destroyed your enemy or it destroyed you.

its a shame both you and me were brought up in the nanny state, it makes you forget what an absolute hell the world was before.

Its true, the English slaughtered killed and traded with every god damn nation on the planet. but if we hadn't England would have been nothing more than a block of coal.

if you don't like the results of the British empire, then I suggest you go and live in the poorest parts of Africa.

The only difference with Queen Victoria is that she was actually against racism and preferred alliances with other countries rather than conquering them.
no body got killed by Queen Victoria unless the bloody asked for it!

You are are in no position what so ever to criticize the British empire when you are sitting in this country reaping the rewards!


whats disgusting is YOU leaching off their poverty!
How many things did you buy from China this year?
How many times have you bought this from poorer countries?

Im sorry but just because England had the fucking brains to do something about it does not make them the bad guys.

And who says their poverty was leashed?
What would happen if we didn't trade or buy things from other countries? Maybe you should consider how many ""poor people were EMPLOYED to make your mp3 player?
If you didn't buy from them, you would see a lot of foreign jobs disappear!

I cannot believe that you have committed such a treacherous act!
We brought health care and medical advancements, technology and education (including building schools to so many countries.
How do you think the slave trade was so successful, and why did other countries agree to trade agreements with us? you think they did it because they were forced? I don;t think so. maybe there were incredible benefits to them also?
Th Suez canal for example. without the British Investment and building bridges etc. the Suez canal would never have happened.
Egypt did not have the money, the knowledge or the resources to do it. So guess who built it? The British. it was a deal made fair and square, only the citizens of Egypt didn't agree as they were to under educated to understand, and constantly kept attacking British outposts along the canal.

You really need to look at what you're talking about.

This means that even if heating costs a significant part of their income, a household still won’t technically be “fuel poor” because the amount it needs to spend to keep warm is still below average.

The logic I'm taking from that is, if the amount of fuel you require is below average, and still moves you below the poverty line,  you're not 'fuel poor' but 'poor'. 

It makes sense to make that distinction as efforts to alleviate fuel poverty will not help them, they're not fuel poor. Reducing green taxes doesn't help them, they pay hardly any as their bills are already low. Offering insulation coupons doesn't help them, they're probably in an efficient house as is.

Their job isn't to report on the news it is to give a bit of controversy and opinion and as far as the Mail (or any media for that matter) their job is to get people in and reading because of their opinion.  They are effectively the same as talk radio hosts...they aren't expected to report ""News"" they are expected to weigh in with an opinion and hopefully that opinion brings in readers whether they agree or disagree with the opinion.  Really it is a shame that people refer to them as journalists as they are much closer to entertainers than journalists.

Barkley and Keys on the other hand are much closer to true journalists, they want to report ""news"" and try to keep opinion subdued when they report.  They will occasionally weigh in with a bit of opinion but they do try (and often succeed) in being impartial in their stories.

To be fair to Big Sam, he basically voiced the opinion that most people put out there, that he respects what AVB said but it may not have been a great choice in the long run as it adds fuel to the fire.

I can see this being the most troubling aspect. Do you do this by Council area? It would need to be different depending on where you live. London is a lot more expensive to live in than Livingston. Then people will have neighbours who are entitled to more than they are despite staying in the same areas - where boundaries cut towns down the middle. Because you live on one side of the street you get less than your neighbours?

&gt;There would be no need for a retirement age, people would work for as long as they wanted to and those that were especially sick could still get benefits if they could reasonably demonstrate that they were needed; which is considerably better than it is now.

I'd argue that the income would need to be different for pensioners and people aged 18. Particularly because many 18 year olds (who are working) still live with their parents whereas pensioners have increases costs for heating (medicine in England too).

true,plutarel,null,null,"Well I think there are several answers I can give you, but here's the essential off the top of my head:

I don't want to live in Romania because there is no future for me there, just grunt work that is paid at 20% it's actual value. I can't afford a decent vacation, I would pay for 2 years to get a smartphone and the infrastructure generally sucks. I can't see myself raising kids in the future without at least trying to find a better environment for them. Isn't it natural to strive for a better future for yourself and your loved ones? Would you not do the same?

So, basically: I can afford a better standard of living while doing the same kind of work. I pay taxes just like everybody else, and I don't see it as decreasing the number of ""fruits"", as you say. I believe that would increase the amount of productive work done in the country. More work, more taxes, more money in the state's coffers (""more fruits"").

Plus, let's take your fruits theory and apply it to an example. Fishermen in the UK are protesting the amount of fish they are allowed to take is too low because it is regulated by the EU. If the UK were to leave the EU, they could fish more and there would be more fish available for everybody. They would thrive and think nothing of the fact that the fish population would be decimated and their industry gone. But to the fisherman leaving the EU is definitely the way to go so he can make more money. 

I'm trying to understand the reasoning behind this ""us"" vs ""them"" mentality. Europe has been at peace for a good while now, why bother invoking nationalism? I've never identified that way with my international friends, I'm just me. I get the feeling not enough people know about ""those"" Romanians and their culture. We're still living, breathing people that walk, talk, smile, make jokes and try to make a living. Perhaps that would help in alleviating the ""fear"" (if I can call it that) of the unknown.

He could have been waiting for the opportune time like you say, but I remember various times throughout the game that he would stop, either waiting for the overlap or a simple pass inside and more often than not look unsure on what to do. His link up play with Zabaleta doesn't seem to click just yet too. That being said, his speed and clinicality on the counter is light years ahead of Silva and Nasri, which more than makes up for a slight lack of intricate dribbling ability. 

While I agree with you to an extent on the defence and the huge hole they create, we are getting much better. As I mentioned in my previous post, the defence are sitting deep because they do not have the pace or midfield cover to play a high line. 

The main problem with the defence at the moment in my opinion is the formation. **Disclaimer: I would not change the current formation for the world.** Amongst the big teams across Europe, two striker formations are no longer a norm. They can be completely overridden by playing a modern sweeper and overloading the midfield, Bayern showed us this. 

City currently have Yaya and Fernandinho and require them to perform Central Midfield duties, aswell as defend the huge hole our low lying defence create. This may be an unpopular opinion, but Yaya is a lazy defender, he just doesn't mark and cover the same way Fernandinho does. Combine that with the fact that most modern formations play between 3 to 5 players in the space that Yaya and Ferna are supposed to cover and you have our problem. The gap between the defence and the midfield is way to big. This is what allowed Shelvey the time and space yesterday and it will keep happening, probably even when Kompany comes back.

true,phishsticker,lfc68,,"Might not be the thread for this but whatever. I mentioned this before and apparently a lot of people disagree, but a midfield 3 of Gerrard, Hendo, Lucas is not balanced at all. You can choose any 2 of the three and it's fine but you absolutely need a player who can bring the ball forward and pick a pass. Whether it is Coutinho, Suso, Alberto you need at least one in the side. Not only that but there are no goals in that midfield 3. Gerrard gets a few from set pieces but that's about it. With no attacking threat, you would at least expect our midfield to help solidify our defense, but that hasn't happened either. With Enrique out and Cissokho being shite, in terms of width we have a massive problem as well. Flanno is good defensively but cant push forward because he has no offensive ability at all so our width is basically limited on the left side. Moses is the one who should be making up for this but he has been extremely poor and our only replacement is Sterling who has been terrible as well, so we have quite a problem at the moment.

Hull was a perfect example of how we have been relying purely on our strikers up till now to create everything. Suarez had to continuously drop deep vs Hull because it's the only way he'll ever get the ball. If Coutinho gets injured before Sturridge gets back I think our chance of getting 4th is pretty much gone unless we make a couple signings in January. I know a lot of people have already written off Aspas but I think he can definitely help fill the void left by Sturridge because he can both pick a pass and score a few goals. Moses has been awful but I can't think of anyone better we could replace him with at the moment other than stick Aspas on the left and Hendo on the RW (or vice versa) with Gerrard in the middle. I think the ideal formation until Sturridge is back is: 

-----------------Mignolet----------------

Johnson-----Skrtel-----Sakho-------Flanno

------------Lucas-------Hendo-----------

-----------------Coutinho----------------

-------Aspas------------------Moses-----

------------------Suarez-----------------

true,aaronhere,null,null,"I think there may be a couple overlapping problems - none of them insurmountable.

1) injuries have weakened the thinnest spots on the team.  The two areas LFC could probably least afford injuries -  LB/RB and Striker - have been the positions most injury prone this season.  Meanwhile, the areas with an abundance of depth - CM and CB - have been largely injury free.

2) Playing players out of position.  The starting lineup for last game was a mess.  Moses cannot play (in my opinion) a CAM, nor is Henderson a right winger.  And Sterling is best utilized as a sub in a counter-attacking formation instead of as a starting winger.  Additionally, Coutinho playing on the left has also happened a bit too often.  Meanwhile, neither Gerrard or Lucas offer enough going forward in a 4-2-3-1.  Their lack of mobility becomes really apparent when watching someone like Paulinho for Tottenham track all over the field and add a real option in attack.

3) Midfield and player politics.  How do you remove the captain from the team?  As many here have been arguing, playing Lucas and Gerrard together really has not worked.  The midfield has been overrun far too often and the link up play with the forward has been, at times, atrocious.  Additionally, the blueprint for beating the team has been high-pressure, which isolates the forwards and makes our midfield seem really immobile.  How many times have we been unable to retain possession, or have just given the ball away cheaply and had to beat a hasty retreat?  

4)  Poor FB play. Enrique has been marvelous at times, but can be inconsistent.  Johnson has been frustrating at best - often giving the ball away or failing to beat anyone 1 v 1.  

All of this is to say, I think things are not at bad as the Hull (!) game made them seem.  I think one starting calibre (doesn't have to be world class) FB and a new CM should be enough to get the team into the top 4.  Addressing the problems of the Gerrard/Lucas CM pairing, as well as putting players in their preferred position, would also help.

true,Thetonn,eng-sussex,Sussex,"Britain was one of the most prepared nations for war that the world had ever seen in 1939. Its military was better equipped than the Germans, with more tanks and a stronger navy. Its troops were better trained and maintained. Its industrial production, taking the empire into account, was far higher. They had a higher population, more popular will across the planet, more money to buy imports and a stronger merchant navy. They also had more submarines than Germany, greater scientific investment and strong ties to the United States who were able and willing to provide massive amounts of goods and services which Germany just could not acquire.

In short, Britain and France were exceptionally well prepared for war, had a stronger economic and industrial base, and should have beaten Germany and Italy convincingly. Even after the fall of France and the restructuring of the economy to cope with a hostile european market, Britain was still more likely to win the war in the long run. Germany had no way of invading Britain and its air capacities were far weaker than Britains, as shown in the air campaign.

Britain was not the plucky underdog standing alone against a tyrannical, larger army. It was one of the strongest militaries the world had ever seen placing too much emphasis on technology and the avoidance of casualties against an enemy which was quick, decisive, and aware of the importance of logistics.

Newsflash, people earn 8 quid a day or less in their home countries, or they can work abroad and earn 80 quid a day ... which would YOU choose?

In the Philippines at least, (I'm sure India, Pakistan etc are similar), there is no welfare system, no housing allowance, no food stamps, no dole cheque, no pension, no medical coverage, NOTHING, unless you have a job to try and provide for yourself and your family.

No work = no food = you die. Fact of fucking life. However, we've got a severe overpopulation problem, and 1000s competing for each and every job locally. Result, *every* job from street sweeper to qualified nurse with 20 years experience all get paid the exact same minimum wage.

So these guys are happy to sacrifice years away from home and family, working in other countries, because they can earn more in 5 years there than they could in 50 in their home countries.

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"&gt; I can see this being the most troubling aspect. Do you do this by Council area? It would need to be different depending on where you live. London is a lot more expensive to live in than Livingston.

The thing is, a guaranteed minimum income fixed nationwide would provide a massive dis-incentive for bubble areas like London, which are caused by a huge heterogeneity income, this policy couldn't remove this, it could just reduce it. People move to where there is work because they need to move *or* they have ambition. If we remove migration by necessity we have now can create a job market which is far less horrible for the people on the bottom end. As people that are poor would have money, they would spend it in their areas creating a far more fluid economic system; people would have work opportunities because people would be giving businesses their money.

Curing the envy of people at the top of society is not something that government policy (except perhaps education?) should really be involved in, but the income needs to be fixed across the nation because otherwise you create incentive just to move to a different town; the incentive should always be to work but because the game is not *indignity or starve* but instead *indignity or no luxuries* employers have to treat their staff with significantly more respect which would encourage investment in the improvement of working conditions and automation.

&gt; I'd argue that the income would need to be different for pensioners and people aged 18. Particularly because many 18 year olds (who are working) still live with their parents whereas pensioners have increases costs for heating (medicine in England too).

As I say, this wouldn't be about taking anything from those that need it the most. Pensioners is a huge group; from people like my family which needs no money, to people that literally just have the state pension and fuck all else with no end in sight.

You could probably say *you don't get this whilst at home* but I think creating all these conditions of the system is part of the problem we have now with these stupid ""strivers vs skivers"" debates that don't have any way of improving quality of life. 

&gt; Why do students get it? Curious about the logic.

If we need highly skilled jobs for a future with technological, scientific and cultural progress we need to create incentive for *anyone* to improve their level of knowledge about the world. Individuals should never feel trapped into choosing between education and starvation, or working and degradation.

Funding Circle are having a renaissance on the rates over the last two weeks. I am seeing 2% higher in each major risk band (8/10/11% in A/B/C). Downsides, this is making older investments harder to sell and any premium you might of got last month will be gone.

If you want these rates just be selective and bid on the £90-100k loans (and above). I bid money as soon as any loan I like completes 100% funding. Lots of companies out there prefer speed of disbursement OVER rate, so you can catch the occasional super high rate.

Sure there are big economic benefits to being in the EU but, when you're pulled down into recession with them, have to fund expensive bailouts and have huge amounts of uncertainty, all because some countries lived beyond their means to the extent where they couldn't recover, the benefits don't look as rosy. Then you have India, Brazil, China... With these countries being rising economic powers, the benefit of Europe doesn't seem as hot as they did 20 years ago.

Going into detail about immigration; the UK didn't need people to work at Tescos, McDonalds etc. in the 90's and early 2000's, nothing really changed when Eastern Europeans started arriving. They forced wages down, lowered working conditions and made getting a job far more difficult for the people without skills that these jobs provide(d) a safety net for.

Meanwhile the additional population puts more of a strain on housing and local services.

All for what? So that McDonald's , Tescos, etc. could make more profit that has minimal benefit to the UK as the tax money goes overseas to tax havens?

There aren't many compelling and demonstrable arguments for the average person on the street to be part of the EU.

And herein lies my biggest gripe with Moffat's storytelling. He needs to show rather than tell. Granted, it'd be easier if River were travelling with the Doctor full-time, which is something we can't have, and I accept that. But I want to see more development and the bookends of their relationship. This is important character development stuff! I don't want to hear that she found out his name at some point for some reason off screen*. I don't want to hear that they're off to the singing towers for their last real goodbye. That stuff needs to be seen and understood and can't just be throwaway references! If we want to believe this relationship, we need a bit more evidence. 

Moffat can do brilliant wibbly wobbly timey wimey plots, which I love, but when it comes to character development, he falls kinda flat.

I had a really odd experience after a collision a few years ago. 

A car drove into the back of me at some lights. As none of us were injured I was happy to deal with it at the roadside but the other driver kept insisting that I call the police, so I did. 

When the police turned up it turned out the guy had no insurance. He got took in the police officer's car (presumably to be written up for driving without insurance) and his car got impounded.

There *are* situations where you genuinely think you are making a good decision, based on the information available, but something bad ends up happening. That shouldn't be a crime, you make good decisions but mistakes can happen.

I don't think there is any situation where free speech is involved that you could successfully argue that though. Like the morons who burned someone alive because they thought he was a peadophile.

This article just reinforces my bias. Lovely story. You never know, do you? I'm glad he got the feedback. I'm dazzled he shared it with the rest of us. 

It's not just a Whovian thing. Decades ago I participated in tough group-therapy sessions at a Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital - *very* angry men who were trying to figure out why they kept drinking too much, getting into fights, abusing their wives and children, drifting from job to job... Angry, frightened, unhappy ex-soldiers who had finally figured out they couldn't tough it out like a man should. They were not happy with that conclusion.

It was a demanding group. Guys had careers, kids, jobs, mortgages and lives waiting for them to get their shit together. We had *no time* for whining or bullshit or drama. There was violence bubbling beneath the surface. And these were men who had been trained in violence.

So one day a guy joins the group. He told us his story. He was there on court ordered therapy. He was a fuckup, a drunk, a loser, a failure as a parent, yattayattayatta - we let him talk it out. 

Finally, I piped up, ""Well, at least you had the good sense to come here and get help."" 

""Yeah,"" he says, ""But..."" and he went on to list the ways he was a worthless piece of shit. It went pretty much like that for two sessions - one guy would say something like, ""You're here now. You the right thing,"" and he would say, ""Yeah"" and we'd hold our breaths, and then he'd say ""Buuuut...."" and dive back into hopelessness. 

It got to the point were one of the more angry guys leaned across the table and got right in his face. ""Listen asshole. I'm gonna tell you you did something right. And you're going to acknowledge that. You're going to say, 'Yeah,' and you're **not** going to say 'But...'. You're just going to shut up and think about the right thing you did. Or so help me..."" At this point the moderator, Laurel, a small pretty lady we were all in love with (sorta - it was group -transference and all that) asked angry biker guy to back off.

He did. Then he said pretty much what I said, ""You came here to get this straightened out. You did a good thing. A right thing."" And Mr. Hung-up says, ""Yeah.""  Wait for it. ""Buuuut..."" and dives back in. He. Simply. Could. Not. Stop.

This went on for another session or so, with less anger. Then one day he came in all excited. He had gotten  permission to leave the hospital grounds for the first time since he had arrived. He put on his civvies and went to a grocery store and bought cigarettes. Uh huh. And guess what? As he finished paying, the nice grocery lady said, ""Have a nice day.""

Quote (it is burned into my cortex): ""And I thought, 'Yeah, I could do that. I could have a nice day. It doesn't always have to be shitty.'""

The image I have in my head of the rest of the group looking at each other always makes me laugh. We're gobstopped. Angry biker guy roars to his feet and leans across the table yelling, ""*YOU GOTTA BE KIDDIN' ME!""* Laurel sat him back down.

And from that day, he started making progress. I don't know if it all got better, probably not. Maybe. But somewhere out there is a bored Safeway clerk who is an angel of mercy and doesn't know it. She is also one of my favorite people in the world. She doesn't know that either. I like that. It opens up possibilities, and *that*, I guess, *is* a Whovian thing.

The sages want us to be mindful of what we do, but how can you be mindful of something like this? A random generic greeting strikes home. A tacky, silly, under-budget Science Fiction show lights a bleak place, opens doors of possibility because one man is an engaging, funny actor who decided to give it his best shot.

We do more kindness than we know. We do more kindness than we *can* know. Thumbs up for Tom Baker for the reminder.

**Edit** Thanks for the gold. I'll accept it in the spirit of the show Dr. Who. What I like about Dr. Who most is that things are not merely gritty and desperate, black and white, do or die, like, say, *Battlestar Galactica*. There is room for something else, something often surprisingly strong and life affecting. 

Sometimes you're confronted with a trivial choice, and you can do the nice thing or you can do the stupid, mean thing. Even if you choose the nice thing, often it doesn't mean anything, just a ""pfffttt"" of decency and it's gone. But *sometimes*... sometimes it goes all whimey up and down the timeline and takes a life of its own and saves the day - or makes someone's day better. You just don't know.

The jobs that the old would've got when they were in their 20s are not as readily available to people in their 20s now. This leaves a void of experience for the young. This then impairs their ability to earn more later in life. It also leaves them with less money saved up which can be used to buy a house (meaning they are paying rent - another drain, usually to someone older) or move location to a better job.

If the old retire, they may become a burden upon the state, but the potential contribution by the younger person who would take their place (either directly or via a chain of promotion) is larger than if they'd kept working.

Additionally, I believe having young people in employment results in more innovation - based purely on my observation that older people tend to become stuck in their ways when more efficient ways exist.

If you mean prevent an German invasion of the UK, then yes I am inclined to agree up to a point. A mass D-Day style invasion of the UK by the Germans could however have overcome the UK in a military sense, even though the political integration would have been exceptionally difficult.

If by win the war, you mean the war against Germany and the intention of freeing occupied countries from occupation -- then on its own there is not a hope in hell that the UK could ever have done that, and over time it would have become increasingly difficult for the UK to defeat ""the rest of Europe"" in a war.

Britain had more than enough tanks in the British Isles that any German invasion would have been a slaughter, to the point we ended up sending thousands of them to the middle east because we had more than enough. In addition, the army that was in the UK was exceptionally well trained and would have been in a strong position to counterattack, while the Navy could have interupted any shipping.

There was a brief rifle shortage, but that is the natural consequence of creating new battalions. Once this was overcome, Britain would almost certainly have won any attempt to subdugate her militarily.

With regards to the war against Germany, there was little reason before the fall of Japan to assume that it could not. It had a larger population base with which to raise troops, greater industrial output, greater access to raw materials, greater economic capital and, perhaps most importantly, a smaller population in Europe to maintain. Germany had to import massive numbers of goods merely to sustain its population which the navy was effectively preventing from happening. 

The possibility of a British intervention on the continent was planned for and prepared for. While US and Russian intervention changed things massively in our favour this was more effective in convincing the British to actually act than anything else.

The flaw in what I am arguing is of course Japan, whose campaigns in the east destroyed British economic power and diverted massive amounts of resources and manpower, but if it were just the British Empire accessing the international markets and a German occupied Europe the numbers clearly fall down on the British side.

It's the right place to be as it creates massive depth and huge options at the top end of the formation and it shouldn't be so difficult to manage the playing time of 3 forwards with injuries and dips/rises in form.  Sturridge in particular looks like one you want to keep rested a bit more as he is so prone to picking up knocks and niggling problems, it's like he's constantly playing injured.

This works out well if you're the writer, since you have all the ""boring"" context stuff in your head. When you're the audience, however, not so much.

Ultimately, Moffat should better adhere to the philosophy of Doctor Who in that it should be more about the journey than the destination.

""I have a friend who's an artist and has sometimes taken a view which I don't agree with very well. He'll hold up a flower and say ""look how beautiful it is,"" and I'll agree. Then he says ""I as an artist can see how beautiful this is but you as a scientist take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing,"" and I think that he's kind of nutty. First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me too, I believe. Although I may not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is ... I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside, which also have a beauty. I mean it's not just beauty at this dimension, at one centimeter; there's also beauty at smaller dimensions, the inner structure, also the processes. The fact that the colors in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting; it means that insects can see the color. It adds a question: does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms? Why is it aesthetic? All kinds of interesting questions which the science knowledge only adds to the excitement, the mystery and the awe of a flower. It only adds. I don't understand how it subtracts.”

Person B, a wealthy pensioner, needs to go into care. The government pays for this partly out of the taxes person A pays, even though they could easily pay themselves.

Definitely. I think aging the Doctor by hundreds of years was a big mistake. It was such a throwaway and really did nothing than tell us that he's had a ridiculous amount of time to live with no development to show for it. One hundred years is a *long* time and a lot can happen during that time, but for all intents and purposes it's the same Doctor that left Amy and Rory. I don't think I would've minded so much if it wasn't such a large number.

Although I have my grievances against Moffat, he has more than made up for his faults by creating amazing stories. Not to mention the 50th anniversary was a masterpiece that was just so wonderfully Doctor Who. If Moffat could do character development as well as RTD, we'd all be screwed.

&gt; ... he's there and it's good for his evolution. It's good for Chelsea because he belongs to us for a long time and I'm happy with that

He's right, Lukaku *is* on contract with the club [until 2016](http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/en/romelu-lukaku/profil/spieler_96341.html?from=direktErgebnis), he's scoring goals almost weekly against our opponents, and he's evolving as a player. 

It's entirely fair for Lukaku to have wanted a move especially if he wants to be in the squad for Rio. People have mentioned it before about our Belgian players, Wilmots wants guys with lots of professional minutes in his squad - this was noted as a particular concern for players like Lukaku and De Bruyne. Unfortunately, Lukaku didn't want to take the gamble of competing against 3 other strikers to secure first-XI minutes - why not go be the big fish in a smaller pond of strikers?

I'd wager that if this all this occurred in 2012 or 2015, there would be less of an issue over this verbal transfer request / loan to Everton and Lukaku would be actively competing for and securing first team football at the club.

My question is whether or not this will be an issue come the end of the season. This is a guy who said in February that he wanted to [become a legend at The Bridge](http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11661/8474316/Romelu-Lukaku-believes-he-can-become-a-legend-at-Chelsea), hopefully he still feels the same way amidst the rumours that Martinez wants to buy him. I think it's a moot point though, I doubt Everton would shell out the dosh to buy Lukaku.

If I'm speculating, Eto'o will probably depart as he seemed to sign as a stopgap measure (that and his contract is only until June of 2014), Torres will ride out the remainder of his contract until 2016, Ba will depart in the summer, Lukaku will return and become a starter who competes/rotates with Torres, and Piazon would stay with the club in 2014 as a third alternative to a forward.",0,1386008728,null,0,false,0,cdrucvr,t3_1rx6tl,t1_cdrucvr,t3_1rx6tl,null,1428425424,23,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,23

No, they really can't. 

Under EU law you cannot go to an EU member state and start claiming benefits. Even if you have the right to stay in the country for longer than three months (and you need to have a job to do that) you still need to prove an additional level of attachment to the country, be it owning a house or having a long term job.

Not to mention the UK already imposes a potentially illegal additional check on EU nationals coming to the UK, the Right to Reside test.

This idea that you can just get on the train to the UK, get off and walk into a jobseekers office and get a cheque is a complete fallacy.

We are not at all a soft touch nation when it comes to welfare.

67s went largely unwanted when the mail traffic they were built for was lost to road transport in the first half of the 2000s. I think they have found a good niche as passenger locos now, it keeps relatively new locos in traffic and I think the two 'Royal' locos will outlive the Mark 3 coaches now used on the Royal Train.

&gt;Allow the employee to be accompanied at the meeting

&gt; Workers have a statutory right to be accompanied by a companion at a grievance meeting which deals with a complaint about a duty owed by the employer to the worker. So this would apply where the complaint is, for example, that the employer is not honouring the worker's contract, or is in breach of legislation.

&gt;The chosen companion may be a fellow worker a trade union representative or an official employed by a trade union. A trade union representative who is not an employed official must have been certified by their union as being competent to accompany a worker.

&gt;However it would not normally be reasonable for workers to insist on being accompanied by a companion whose presence would prejudice the hearing nor would it be reasonable for a worker to ask to be accompanied by a companion from a remote geographical location if someone suitable and willing was available on site. 

Couple of things to clarify, if she is being bullied did she report it? if so is this disciplinary then coming about as a result of her own grievance being raised? 

Also you are entitled for the person to be dealing with the grievance to be Neutral, generally be a manager from another site who has no dealing with anyone related to the grievence, and this being totally neutral.

The point of red lights are that they stop all traffic so that someone proceeding on a green light can be 95% certain someone isn't going to travel into their path.

A cyclist *can* cause very real injuries to a pedestrian. The stop time on a set of pedestrian lights is so low that unless you're proposing to travel at speed, by the time you've approached, slowed, checked that nobody is going to suddenly dart out (and they've right of way, so there's no need for them to consider whether you've seen them), and crossed at a slow controlled speed then you may as well have stopped for them in the first place for all the time you've made up.

Don't forget that even an emergency vehicle running on the blues treats a red light as a give way sign, which is what you're proposing.

Whilst there is an argument that cyclists should be allowed certain exemptions to acknowledge their vulnerability, allowing them to jump one type of red light is hazardous to the pedestrians and everyone else (including themselves) when inevitably cyclists don't recognise the type of red light they *can* jump and start jumping lights they can't putting themselves in the middle of a very dangerous situation.",0,1386009673,null,0,false,0,cdrur60,t3_1rx0mn,t1_cdrur60,t1_cdrs9p1,null,1428425240,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Alos this
&gt;Asim Qureshi, research director of Cage, a campaign group that has been in touch with many of those who have been stripped of their citizenship, said: ‘Theresa May’s move is the latest expression of the systematic way in which the UK government has aggressively stripped Muslims in particular of their most basic rights under the guise of the “war on terror”. The fact that the coalition has managed to denude at least twenty Britons of their rights since coming to power three years ago, whilst the previous government managed only five in over a decade, is a real cause for concern.

How do we know they were all Muslims? religion should make no difference to revocation of state?

*Edit*
Also who exactly is funding his battle against the UK Government?

&gt;Al Jedda, who came to Britain as an asylum seeker in 1992, automatically lost his Iraqi nationality under the law of the time when he became a British citizen. In 2004 he was detained by British forces in Iraq and held for three years on suspicion of planning terrorist acts. Because he was held in military detention he was never charged. He has claimed he was ill-treated in British detention.

wait so he came to the UK and obtained Asylum, then decided to go back to Iraq AFTER we have just 'liberated it' (and it was in the throws of Sectarian violence started by the Ottomans 500 years prior) 

Stripped by Jacquie Smith after being stopped by military forces on grounds of Terrorisms (no further info on how or what this was) gets freed then sneaks into Turkey and starts legal proceedings against the UK?

1.) You have to follow someone to get their messages (or follow someone who retweets their messages). It takes one click of a mouse to unfollow someone.

3.) Twitter has a block feature, so even if your friends are retweeting it and you don't want to unfollow them just to get rid of the bad tweet you can still remove it from your stream.

4.) Twitter has a customer service department, terms of service, rules etc so if Twitter agree with your position the user can be removed entirely from the service. 

5.) It's well within your capability to respond to the user with reason. Try change their mind, try get them to see it your way.

6.) Twitter is an entirely optional product. If you unfollowed, you blocked, you reported and it's still there haunting your dreams or whatever you can just *stop going to Twitter*.

Eto'o had won essentially everything there was to win before he moved from Barcelona to Inter Milan (3x league titles, Copa Del Rey, 2x Spanish cups, 2x Champions League Titles), and had won something like 5 titles in one season with Mourinho before deciding to cash out at Anzhi. At 32 I think he's just having fun now and collecting a cheque, and he ultimately had decided to either go to Inter Milan (where he had played before) or Chelsea (where Mourinho his former manager is), that has to count for something.

Ba seems loyal to the league itself considering after West Ham got relegated in 2011 [he turned down a sizable bonus](http://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jun/15/demba-ba-west-ham-everton) to stay in the league. He was doing really well at Newcastle before Chelsea came knocking in January, and I suspect if they didn't he would have stayed and continued to link up well with guys like Cisse and Cabaye.

That aside, I think the future would look something like what I had mentioned. Torres, Lukaku, Piazon (Bamford maybe, if he gets some time at a team better than MK Dons), with Schurrle taking some precedence over Piazon in the forward slot when they're not deploying him out wide.

true,Zakialwe,eng-dorset,Dorset,"&gt; The problem is that for the past few decades Britain has had extremely lax immigration policy which in the most part has been a huge economic &amp; social burden to the country

Really, because its almost like you've made a completely unsubstantiated Daily Mail statement. You certainly don't quote any sources.

How about some evidence that the complete opposite is true:

[A study](http://www.cream-migration.org/publ_uploads/CDP_22_13.pdf) by the University College London notes that immigrants to the UK since 2000 have generated a significant net benfit to the UK by paying more in taxes than they recieve. This is contrast to British citizens who paid less tax than they got back. 

[The OECD agrees](http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/social-issues-migration-health/international-migration-outlook-2013_migr_outlook-2013-en#page2), and on page 157 you will see a nice grapth that shows that even when you include pension costs immigrant households contribute more than native born households on average.

[Eurostat notes](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-11-034/EN/KS-SF-11-034-EN.PDF) that despite, as you put it decades of ""extremely lax immigration policy"", the UK  has a foreign population well in line with other EU nations like Germany, France, Ireland and Spain. 

Strange that despite our super lax rules we seem to be on on par with other big industrial nations when it comes to immigration, and also that up until the recession all these nations had good, thriving economies.

Similar restrictions on things such as hate speech can be found across Europe, which makes up a fair chunk of the western world. Look at the scope of things such as laws against Holocaust denial across Europe, something that isn't illegal in the UK.

The UK definitely has freedom of speech and freedom of expression, just not to the extent seen in the USA, a country that is far more the exception than the rule. For better or worse, European nations generally seem to have a different interpretation of what constitutes free speech.

What if we can place that kids with a family tomorrow and it can have a happy, safe little life, never knowing the issues around where it came from?

I would love to be able to say she is ""cured"" and to give her the kid back and everyone to live happily ever after.  But that is not a likely outcome and just handing the baby back as soon as she has a good day is not the same as making that happen.

At the end of the day, we need to do what is best for the kid first and for her second.  You can disagree with that list of priorities, but unless you do, leaving the baby in a home with guarunteed safety is better than putting it with a mother who is at best very questionable.  And in the longer term, kids are best staying where they are, where it is stable and where they are used to life.

She doesn't own that kid.  It's not really ""her's"" any more than it is ""your's"" or mine.  It is it's own life and it deserves the best chance at the best future.  Not to be passed around as suits warm feelings.

It's worth adding that apparently it is teens who spend a lot of time being fostered, babies are in demand and can go straight to adoption.

Obviously he will still be doing his share of the defending but because he has 2 players behind him there wouldn't be a huge gaping hole to play in when he forgets that that it's not 2009 anymore and he's not playing as a second striker behind Torres anymore with Mascherano there to judo chop any potential attack in the throat for him.  This pushes Coutinho to a wider role and that kindof sucks but he can still be quite effective and there's nothing wrong with him drifting about a bit and interchanging with the other forwards.  BR freaking loves his inside forwards anyway, so it fits.  And then Stevie will need a rest sometimes at this point so we can move Coutinho central for those matches if we're secure in our defensive prospects.  The boy is a terror on opposing defences when given the freedom of the whole park to play in and orchestrate the attack.

That said, it still isn't right.  And it won't be right with the players we currently have.  We need at least one new midfielder.  Someone like Bender or Matic would be a really good fit (though I highly doubt we have a chance in hell at either of them).  They're both strong and mobile, plus they can play with the ball at their feet.  Having one of them alongside Lucas will really change things hugely.  Against Everton we saw Lucas play possibly his best match of the season so far but I really think he was only able to perform so well because he knew he had Allen backing him up.  When he's got too much ground to keep track of Lucas gets stretched too thin and can't manage it all.  He's an outstanding ball winning midfielder but he needs someone to help him fill the space, he isn't athletic enough on his own.  Pairing him with a very mobile partner in a double pivot would really lock down our midfield now and finally provide us that solid platform we need to dominate a match.",0,1386011726,null,0,false,0,cdrvmsi,t3_1rv05t,t1_cdrvmsi,t1_cdrhqyk,null,1428424830,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Whilst independence is a central issue for both parties I think it's reasonable to say that it's a issue of greater prominence, up until the last couple of years at least, to UKIP than the SNP.

I can't really describe it but I guess to me there just seems to be more about the SNP than UKIP; they don't seem like a one issue party which is how I perceive UKIP. They seem more mature, they've been around longer and are actually involved with governance.

Take away the focus on independence and you're left pretty much which an excessively populist faction of what generally would be the conservatives (that's my perception).

true,Orsenfelt,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; So, in your opinion would you be happier if the document that governs your rights was similar to the way the United States Constitution is set up, in that the First amendment is the right to freedom of speech without censorship?

Yes. 

I think there are certainly flaws with the way the US does it, you obviously run into issues where corporations end up being allowed to spend unlimited amounts of money on political campaigns and things like that *but* we should have a more defined line.

Currently our free speech law works much like our weapon laws, where it's written in a vague way so that just how much of a crime you committed can be determined on a case by case basis. 

Which actually works *decently* for weapons laws, for example if you carry a knife whilst hiking it's probably not going to be a problem but carry the same knife through dark alleyways in a city then it becomes a crime. It's all down to the police officer deciding when he catches you if what you are doing is reasonable or not. It's not ideal, and I know the concept kind of scares Americans but we've done ok for years with it that way and it doesn't seem to be abused.

However in speech issues it's usually not a police officer that notices first. It's not a 1 on 1 discussion of ""*What are you doing with that, sir?*"".. it's more often the case like this where someone says something stupid on Twitter, lots of people get outraged and flood the police with it. So for speech stuff there is a lot of public pressure from the get go and I think that makes the police/governments cave to it and to go along with punishment to try and make the situation settle down.

So actually for me you could say the law itself isn't the problem, it's people thinking the police are the answer to people saying nasty things... *but*.. if we had more defined free speech laws it would be easier to throw this stuff out of court and get the message across that people are allowed to offend you.",0,1386012911,null,0,false,0,cdrw56z,t3_1rwlil,t1_cdrw56z,t1_cdrvkfd,null,1428424590,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

&gt; Should an officer be held blameless for ordering his soldiers to commit war crimes? According to your logic, yes, since he's saying something and not doing something.

Whoa there Godwin, let's slow it down a little.

There is a huge, HUGE difference between some fool saying something to an audience, and an officer who is giving an ORDER to his subordinates.  The audience has no expectation or requirement to carry out anything a public speaker has to say; they have their own will.  That is NOT the case in a military organization.  Or even a civilian organizational hierarchy for that matter.

&gt; Lucy Reynolds is an academic who has studied the background of the NHS in detail, learning in the process what the appalling consequences of privatisation will be.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkTnCtg_Omk

Logically, the easiest way to push through reforms amounting to privatisation is to sabotage the service through intentional bad management, unnecessary restructuring, and misalllocation of resources.

Such sabotage will lead to bad performance, which will lead to the compliant media dutifully reporting bad performance (sans the analysis and context required), which then translates into public dissatisfaction and the generation of consent for vaguely-understood ""reform"".",0,1386014978,null,0,false,0,cdrx1x7,t3_1rxh94,t1_cdrx1x7,t3_1rxh94,null,1428424166,32,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,32

It just feels like they've been around for ever - let's face it, they have - and with there still being no viable replacement for them in the pipeline, it's a mystery to the best of us what the hell's going to happen once 2020 rolls around.

Frankly, the 2020 accessibility deadline is something that, at this rate, is never likely to end up being fully enforced. Never even mind the complete impractibility of implementing that legislation on the most rural routes served mostly by 153s - unless there really is a true 3rd-generation scheme agreed in, say, the next three years max, the majority of the periphery rail network would be forced to close - let's face it, the entire Sprinter family would have to be significantly modified - only Greater Anglia's 156's have received such modification, meaning that even the huge 158/159 fleet, a backbone of services in vast swathes of the country has no such preperation. We're potentially talking billions to ward off the axe of rural services nationwide, all thanks to poorly-applied legislation which takes no notice of the practicalities of its very existence.

I didn't even mention the pacers. Oh god, the pacers. I have a soft spot for the crappy old things, but it's a farce that they're even still running in 2013. Yet there's now the very real threat of they themselves being forced out of service in 5-7 years time without any replacement in sight. Cattle class will seem a luxury at this rate.

The whole situation is set up for a flurry of last minute purchases that will result in unreliable, non-standardised classes of locomotive not seen since BR first experimented with new classes in the late 50's. Don't try to claim it doesn't happen on the modern railway, either - the spectacular mess of the replacement of Slam Door stock by the 458 ""Junipers"" or the major teething issues of the FGW 180s proves the risk associated with new trains - the fact that many of the routes the 180s used now rely on older 150 sprinters is perhaps a perfectly ironic example that refurbishment is often a better option.

Personally, I like to think the answer would be for Bombardier to develop a single-car equivalent of the Turbostar series to fill the 153 gap (given their proven reliability, flexibility and which would also help standardise fleets), but even then, we'd essentially be relying on a nigh-on 20-year old design for our railway future: madness.",0,1386014980,null,0,1386015652,0,cdrx1yj,t3_1ru5m2,t1_cdrx1yj,t1_cdrumg6,null,1428424166,2,false,uktrains,t5_2z9xu,2

true,Orsenfelt,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; If you really think that words have no power and value then why are you writing in the first place?

Not quite what I think. I think we choose to give words power, they have no inherent value. A certain collection words can both be a funny joke from a comedian and a racial slur.

There are plenty of situations where words can be used to hurt, situations where you can't easily avoid them and sure some places where your own mental fortitude might not be enough.

However I don't believe the internet to be one of those situations, if anything I believe it to be the opposite. It's an excellent training ground, it's a place where you can view the whole gamut of opinion from terrible to great but still be physically distant from it, still be able to make it all go away with one click.

I've been online, unsupervised, since I was about 7 years old and long before there was the nice mainstream part of it like Facebook. I've seen all sorts of terrible stuff and I don't think I've numbed to it, I've just became more aware of my own mind and what I'm willing to experience. I've became capable of being my own filter. 

People online today, your mainstream average society people, their internet training comes from Facebook. A place where people have real names, real faces and a nice little list of privacy settings. To me those things are all a lie, they are a facade that prevents people learning how the internet actually works and what the possibilities actually are. They treat it like just a more interactive version of television and that's why it so massively shocks them when it's revealed to them that actually there is no control. There is no barrier to entry.. and they run to the police.

I think that has to change. I don't think cyber bullying etc is *good* but I do think that trolling (Deliberately saying provocative things to get a reaction) can actually have a positive effect, it can train people to be a little bit more aware of the technology they are using.

true,northerncal,lfc68,,"That was my main concern, just that there is no one in midfield who can break up play, so you risk inviting unnecessary pressure on our defense by not having a ball winner until you get to the backline. In addition, you have nobody defensively skilled to cover an opposition CAM, exposing exploitable space between our lines. I agree that having 3 cbs + a fourth defensive player in midfield sounds excessive against Norwich, but no cover until the center backs is risky, so it's a tough line to walk. I guess the question than is why do you think it's important enough to play with 3 cbs? Because that is a look we have just done before, or do you believe it addresses something specific to Norwich? 

If the former, I might look at training a cb (maybe Agger) to play a little further forwards as a water-carrier in a double pivot with Allen, that way Allen would have more freedom to move up the pitch when in possession, helping dictate the passing and tempo, and Agger or other cb/dm would stay back just ahead of the backline in protection. It likely would take a decent amount of training to get players used to this scheme, but I think it has potential to be a little more 'well rounded' as a formation for weaker sides compared to simply 3 cbs and no dms, especially (maybe only) against teams with 1 striker formations.

true,Zakialwe,eng-dorset,Dorset,"&gt;  You realise that the jobs that these people are paying tax on could have gone to natives?

The job market is basically supply and demand. If there isn't the supply of workers to fill the demand then migrants will fill the gap.
In the UK this is often because a lack of investment by the Government in vocational training over the past few years has left companies, like the one I work for, struggling to find workers with even basic levels of experience in things like welding, or assembly.

You know how much money it costs to train a worker to do these things? A lot. Shareholders hate costs.

So when you're a business you've got a choice, you can either move to where workers with those skills are, or you can hire migrants. Either national or international.

Not to mention that most of this work is temporary in nature, like farm work. Why bother training someone to do a job for 3 months when you can hire an immigrant for the same price who has the experience already from their home nation?

This is not the fault of migration, its the fact of our labour market and the lack of investment in it's own population by the Government.

&gt;Do you not care about the horrendous overcrowding in this country? Our population density is literally ridiculous. What about the people taking money out of our economy by sending it home to their families?

Those are two very separate issues so let me address the first initially.
Yes I care. Global population levels are in my opinion too high. Luckily they're stabilising and should start falling nicely through the next century or so. The UK is again, in my opinion too overcrowded, but this is subjective. Someone from say Belgium would consider the UK rather empty by comparison to their home.

So yes, you're right immigrants contribute to the population of the UK, have a prize.

But is this all bad? To address your second point, so what?

Immigrants send money home, this is indeed I suspect quite common. But they still need to live somewhere, buy food, clothes, petrol, the occasional night out, taxes, bills etc. So yes, maybe they aren't saving for that big British made car (lol) but they sure are contributing to the economy regardless. And if you bothered to read the studies I linked before you'd note that migrants put much more in the communal pot than they take out. Even if they do send money home.

And when they get old, what do most EU migrants do? They do what we do and go either back to their home country, or somewhere warm like Spain, leaving space for other people here in the UK.

&gt;Dismissing any non-positive opinion on immigration as ""B-but that's a Daily Mail statement! Racist!!11!!"" doesn't help your cause.

I didn't, making things up doesn't help your laughable excuse for a case against migration. I mean come on subjective opinions one after the other is great in a loud debate down the pub when no one gives a shit, but on the internet you're gonna get destroyed. Unless you comment on YouTube of course.

I give you reputable evidence from independent sources, and you give me hyperbole and slander. Great.

&gt;I suspect you don't care anyway, you live in fucking Dorset where there are about 7 other people and you don't feel the effects of immigration.

I do care, surprisingly, otherwise I wouldn't be spending my time arguing the matter with a complete stranger over the internet...
I moved here for work, yes I'm an internal migrant! The horror! It's very nice here in fucking Dorset. Though you're right, there are few immigrants, just tons of pensioners who's pensions need paying.

I work for a medium sized manufacturing company. About half of the design staff are foreign, some from the EU and some from elsewhere. If the foreign staff left, we couldn't keep going, and all the semi skilled and unskilled shop floor workers would be out of a job.

For anyone with any skills, working with foreigners is just a normal part of daily life. 

Unskilled workers tend to think that their pay rate has dropped due to an influx of foreign workers. Sometimes they might be correct.

This is not solely down to either of these players though - I read an interesting piece on the game today that was talking about our midfield, and about how difficult it was for the wingers because of the position of the rest of the players. Henderson should not have been at CAM... that was the worst mistake in our line up, and the article suggested (I think correctly) that the outcome would not have been much better no matter who we had on the wings.

Toure didn't have a bad game - it wasn't great, but with the exception of Skrtel (unlucky sod...), did anyone really have a great game?

Henderson... what? He is not a CAM. Never has been, nor will he ever be. a few weeks ago the sun was shining from this guys arse, and rightly so.

true,trasofsunnyvale,lfc12,,"Saying he doesn't put in 100% is an absurdly naive view of tactics and player roles, especially in our midfield. Also, to say Gerrard is ""stationary"" is criminally incorrect, for me. He moves a lot. I can't tell you how many times he was standing at the top of our box defending when Hull had the ball in our third. Further, he usually is in the vicinity of our opponent's box when we're in their third (although, I admit he did this much less against Hull). 

What needs to be accepted is that his job is not to bomb into the box anymore, he is there to pick out players to start the attack/counter and to make sure we spread the ball around the pitch and keep possession. Henderson is there for work rate and to operate as a true box-to-box player, and we'd see how well he does at this if he'd take his chances.

I do concede, that, yes, Gerrard needs to help out in defense. But he largely does. Yes, he also needs to be able to support the attack, especially with his finishing skills. And he does, just not as often as in previous years (and even less so with our personnel, which has usually been quite attacking this season). He is not there to run into the box every play or track back every play. No one dogged Xabi about this--I don't get it. What Gerrard once was doesn't necessarily dictate what he is now--or more importantly what he needs to be.

There is the first virtue, he has given up his whole life to save others for no payment (and so far that's 900+) years. He never lets his companions die (apart from Adric but he was annoying) and even though he once had the chance to destroy all the Daleks (his worst enemy) in the cosmos, he chose not to as it would still be genocide even if they were evil.

We spend ten times this amount on servicing debt, almost 12 times as much on welfare, about 30 times as much on pensions and almost the same again on healthcare. These proportions grow even more if you factor in local govt spending.

Yes the MOD has had some ridiculously stupid acquisition problems, but lots of these are caused by moronic decisions taken by politicians for political reasons, eg. Gordon Brown delaying construction of the new aircraft carriers for a year or more, adding billions to the cost. Or cutting equipment numbers so that the cost per unit spirals upwards, making them seem less affordable so they all end up getting cut (see Nimrod).

Hey now, other people commit war crimes. Yellow card for premature Godwin-calling.

&gt;There is a huge, HUGE difference between some fool saying something to an audience, and an officer who is giving an ORDER to his subordinates. The audience has no expectation or requirement to carry out anything a public speaker has to say; they have their own will. 

Again, you're arguing the case for the soldier having responsibility, as if I'm arguing against it. I'm not, I agree completely with that. What I'm saying is that the officer ALSO has responsibility. You might think an order is different than a tweet or, more broadly, a public speaking agenda, because the officer expects his soldiers to follow his orders. However, that line becomes blurry when the orders are illegal; the soldiers may or may not follow those orders. If the officer is optimistic about the morality of his soldiers, maybe he *doesn't* expect his soldiers to actually follow his orders at all, so now he's just saying shit with no expectation of anyone following along. Does that absolve him of responsibility for ordering something illegal?

Now take a public speaker in a politically, racially, religiously, whatever charged environment, who has every expectation - more than the optimistic officer up there - that some idiot out there is going to make a stupid decision because this public speaking is going to rile people up. They have every expectation that their actions in terms of what they say are going to hurt other people. 

I'll stop and say that *morally* I think this situation is very clear, and I hope you agree to that as a starting point. Legally, it's not so clear, but it's not hard to imagine that there are some situations - say, an ""officer"" of a terrorist organization giving ""orders"" to fanatic ""soldiers"" - where people who just speak have legal responsibility.

true,ParrotofDoom,english,Greater Manchester,"Some traffic regulations actually increase the level of risk posed to cyclists by other road users.

For instance, ignoring a stop line at a red light can, on occasion, make the cyclist far more visible to other road users and give him/her the chance to clear the junction before anyone else.  Sometimes you can filter several hundred yards to the head of a queue of traffic, only to find that the ASL is blocked.  Best to ignore the stop line and park directly in front of the lead vehicle than stay alongside it.  And there are traffic light controlled junctions which are controlled by sensors embedded in the asphalt.  Often, those sensors won't register a bicycle, so you just have to ignore the light and make your way across.

Another example is not being able to cycle on standard pavements.  There is a road near me, the A556 near Knutsford, that would be utterly crazy to cycle on (60mph, four lanes, single carriageway).  And yet to do so is quite legal.  When I cross that road I do so by using the pavement, like this:

http://goo.gl/maps/xhPp6

Illegal but much, much safer for me.  And since it's in the middle of nowhere, I've never seen a pedestrian on that pavement.  Ever.  Similarly, there are some footpaths on which cycling isn't allowed, but which offer a vastly safer alternative to the busy roads surrounding it.

Most traffic laws are written for motor vehicles.  For instance, it's illegal to overtake another vehicle in the zigzag area of a pedestrian crossing, but it isn't illegal to overtake a cyclist there, despite the same risks being evident.  And it's also illegal to drive on a pavement, but that law is widely flouted and almost never enforced.

I would like to think there is enough electrification planned over the next decade that 170s could be cascaded down (ha!). They would need re-gearing and downgrading to 75mph units for most rural routes though if we're being honest.

I live in a semi-rural area and rely on the train because I don't hold a driving licence. I hope the idea of rural lines being forced to close is a 'worst-case' scenario. Yes the accessibility mods need doing but as I understand it, technically only one coach per train needs doing for the train to be compliant.

158s and 159s will get mods easily once the 156s are done, I think there are a lot of companies planning their 2020 work now. I would hope so anyway! The legislation is very poorly applied because we are about the only EU nation who put a deadline on the accessibility work.

One thing the 458 and 180 have in common is the manufacturer, Alstom. That was when their trains didn't work 'out of the box'. The 458 is now doing well for reliability (see the Modern Railways magazine 'Golden Spanners' awards).

FGW wanted a Voyager equivalent in the 180 and didn't get it, again the reliability was poor. Now the 3 operators are working with Alstom they are improving, but they needed a lot of work even recently to get there. Same with the 175s Arriva Trains Wales have, they got them after First North Western had to iron all the bugs out. Even then they got mechanical mods recently.

Frankly the Pendolinos were about the most reliable thing Alstom built at the start of the last decade.

You will see his first encounters with monsters such as the Daleks, Cybermen, Master, Silurians, and more. You also see his people and begin to understand why he left Gallifrey.

However the classic series is very good in its own right and should not just be watched to better understand the reboot but because you want to see the Doctor encounter adventures, new experiences, comedy, Moral challenges and conundrums.
Recommended episodes are Genesis of the Daleks which explores the allegory behind the Daleks and morality http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkelV2WUNdw, City of Death  which is  Douglas Adams and his comedy, Rememberance of the Daleks for this scene and lore and good story http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blzpa5oyUVg. The Deadly Assassin shows him adventuring and shows why he left Gallifrey as well as being a good political thriller.

He definitely doesn't run as much as Henderson or Lucas, but he's not noticeably less mobile in his approach, for me. It's one thing to say he isn't the player for that type of play, but that we need him to be and a totally different statement to say he's ""slacking"" which is completely questioning his commitment. Isn't he beyond accusations of slacking at this point? Do you truly question his commitment? If you want to compare him to a player slacking, look at him versus Moses. Moses appears like he won't dirty his shirt for Liverpool.

He doesn't cover as much ground as before, but I don't see how one can ignore the role of tactics in the explanation for that. I don't think it makes sense to drop Gerrard because whatever we gain from someone more mobile with better endurance is cancelled out greatly--in my opinion--for what we lose without Gerrard's passing, ability to keep possession and his skill on set pieces.

I almost fully agree with you - no need to expand on the parts where I agree, it's basically the same as anyone else.

Now, the interesting part:

Take comments, like, homophobia. Authorizing those type of comments will, if those are numerous enough - and they often are, create a toxic environment for many; the hate of some, passivity of many, would send a message ""you don't belong in this country"". Would you leave those comments, or would be ok to forbid them?

In case some says you can't draw a line between homophoc/antisemitic/etc. comments and just cunt comments: most of the time, you can. Just from a set of principles (like the Human Rights Declaration), you can very often see if the author is just making a negative comment, or attacking a whole group that did nothing to him/her.

I'm perfectly fine if other country citizens answer differently to this, but I like how my country (France) is doing. Except that the law is badly enforced.

&gt; It's like walking down the street and seeing a little strip of paper with ""*Fuck you, cunt*"" written on it.

Finding a random strip of paper in the street is more analogous to being in a chatroom, when a troll comes in and says ""*Fuck you, cunt*"" to the chat. If you find such a slip of paper, you don't know if the paper is directed to you, or anyone else. It is anonymous. A one-time message from someone you'll never see again. That paper could be meant for the guy behind you, or the guy in front of you.

A more apt analogy would be if you saw multiple strips of paper, all from the same person, with different criticisms directed at you. Like if I saw a piece of paper that said ""You're worthless, Orsenfelt. *-Jane.*"" Then another, ""Orsenfelt, nobody likes you. *-Jane.*"" A third, ""Orsenfelt, you should kill yourself. You'll amount to nothing. *-Jane.*""

For if someone, one person, is continually harrassing you, there is still a degree of anonymity. But it is known to be the same person, over and over. Maybe ""Jane"" is a pseudonym. Regardless of true name, it's the same person, repeatedly. And the comments are directed at you, as opposed to just some random wanderer of the streets.


&gt; Not only that but wishing for something doesn't actually effect reality you precious fuckwits. If I hope all the children die in fires tomorrow it doesn't make it more likely, I'm not actually causing anything.. you're just a fucking idiot.

I don't see how the comparison you make is fair, for a few reasons. I'll go to the letter C.

A. The death of all children, by fire, is infeasible. Saying ""I hope you commit suicide"" over the internet, and that hope coming true, is feasible. Just because you wish for something incredibly unlikely *(like the death of all children)*, and it doesn't happen, that doesn't mean your words have no effect on smaller-scale issues, like one person's life. Your argument here is essentially ""Saying 'I hope that I grow tentacles in the next five seconds' doesn't cause it to happen. Therefore, my words never influence real-life events.""

B. Children do not choose to die in fires. Fun fact, children have the lowest suicide rate, of all age groups. Adolescents have the highest rate. If you bully someone over the internet, and you cause their suicide, you pretty damn well caused that death. Your words influenced an individual into taking their own life. With cyber bullying, or just hate speech in general, online or offline, you've swayed an individual. An individual with the power to bring your desires to fruition. By telling the world that you want children to die, you accomplish nothing. Because no one has the power to burn all children. But one person has the power to take their own life.

C. It doesn't matter if your wish comes completely true. If your hateful words towards children cause one psychopath to set an orphanage on fire, killing two children, you are still responsible. Your wish didn't come true, but you still caused the deaths. Likewise, if you cause some teenager to attempt suicide, yet fail in his attempt, you still are culpable. It doesn't matter if you make the kid commit suicide. What matters is your words' effects, regardless of the end goal you had in mind. **You can cause a tragedy, even if your words do not come true, word-for-word.**

&gt; You can block him, you can get Twitter to ban him or you can take the most effective route and stop letting the stupid meaningless shit other people say have such a dramatic effect on your life because that's the reason they do it.

I have one question. Do you think people choose to be bothered by what others say? Do you think someone wants to be gutted by the insults they receive over the internet? If so, then you are sorely mistaken, friend.


I think that people should get thicker skin. That would be great. But it isn't so simple as saying ""I am no longer bothered by this."" Until people have the perspective to just sit down, stop, and ask ""Does this really matter?"", we should be conscientious. We should treat each other like human beings.

I don't think people should be punished for what they say on the internet, to one another. But don't trivialize the victims here. For some, it isn't so easy as saying ""I no longer care about what anonymous internet people say to me.""",0,1386022014,null,0,false,0,cds0cca,t3_1rwlil,t1_cds0cca,t1_cdroam9,null,1428422618,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3
true,mushroomchow,null,null,"Turbostars are a very good ride - I sure miss them given that when Central Trains got cascaded into EMT, they all ended up being replaced by extra 156s. Theyre still alright, but not nearly as good for the long haul - the Lincoln train springs to mind.

I still think there's a very real need for single-car units. The flexibility they offer is second to none. Increasingly on the Lincoln-Leicester train, they're tacked onto a 156 as a third coach for rush hour capacity, but another 2 car unit would be impractical due to a mix of 2-car length platforms and that extra capacity being wasted when it could be used elsewhere.

The reason I'd use the turbostars as a model (besides to support UK engineering!) is their sheer reliability, which is even more important when there's only one engine to rely on. Electrification is slowly gathering pace, granted, but at nowhere near the level needed to remove the need for replacements on dieselised routes.

Back onto the Pacer situation, I was going to suggest that refurbished Sprinters from EMT could cover their retirement once the MML electrifies, but their diagrams are mostly over routes that won't be part of the scheme (Lincoln, Norwich and the Hope Valley to name a few) so that's another possibility out the window.

Good to hear Alstom have sorted themselves out now, too.

Edit: Oh, and if I remember correctly, the Turbostars Central operated are fitted to work with Sprinters too? That'd be a godsend for any areas where they would be phased in to replace them.

The former is crucial because Lennon can either burst down the right and cross on his stronger foot, or vary it up by making diagonal runs across the field.  He's less naturally talented than Townsend, but knows his role on the right better and is a more natural fit for Soldado's style of play.

Also, Paulinho offered some power and energy up there.  He didn't have an awesome game, but he did close down well and cause Utd problems.  Too often this season, our most attacking central midfielder has sat in front of the opposition CDM, which means Soldado effectively has 3-4 defenders around him at any one time.  There were times yesterday when Paulinho played so high that he was level with Bobby... makes them both harder to mark, and Paulinho will naturally win more balls up there than Soldado.

I mean, look at Alex Salmond and the SNP's recent manifesto for independence. It runs to several hundred pages and part of the case they make for an 'independent' Scotland is guaranteed childcare for all. Jesus wept. That's not a confident case for independence. But that's the kind of bollocks that would work its way into a modern codified constitution. I'm trying to imagine the United States' Founding Fathers worrying about childcare as they pondered independence and their constitution. Fortunately, they were concerned about protecting the fundamental rights that would be won upon their independence (and in such a relatively short and simple document, too).

Besides, unless such a constitution existed outside of the legislative and constitutional practices of Parliament, it would be ultimately meaningless: it could be easily modified or repealed in the ordinary way that other legislation is enacted.

1st Doctor: 

— “The least important things, sometimes, lead to the greatest discoveries.”

— “I don't believe that man was made to be controlled by machines. Machines can make laws, but they can not preserve justice. Only human beings can do that.”

2nd Doctor: 

— “Our lives are different to anybody else’s. That’s the exciting thing. Nobody in the universe can do what we’re doing.”

— “There are some corners of the universe which have bred the most terrible things. Things which act against everything we believe in. They must be fought.”

— “Keep it confused, feed it with useless information. I wonder if I have a television set handy.”

3rd Doctor: 

— “I want to see the universe - not rule it!”

— “I'm not wild about computers myself, but they are a tool. If you have a tool, it's stupid not to use it.”

— “I sometimes think that military intelligence is a contradiction in terms.”

4th Doctor: 

— “You know, the very powerful and the very stupid has one thing in common. They don't alter their views to fit the facts. They alter the facts to fit their views. Which can be very uncomfortable if you happen to be one of the facts that need altering.”

— “There's no point in being grown up if you can't be childish sometimes.”

— “I never carry weapons. If people see you mean them no harm, they never hurt you. Nine times out of ten...”

5th Doctor:

— “I try to believe three impossible things before breakfast.”

— “Dreams are important. Never underestimate them.”

— “When did you last have the pleasure of smelling a flower, watching a sunset, eating a well-prepared meal? (...) For some people, small, beautiful events are what life is all about!”

6th Doctor:

— “Planets come and go. Stars perish. Matter disperses, coalesces, forms into other patterns, other worlds. Nothing can be eternal.”

— “In all my travelling throughout the universe, I have battled against evil, against power-mad conspirators. I should have stayed here. The oldest civilisation: decadent, degenerate, and rotten to the core. Power-mad conspirators, Daleks, Sontarans... Cybermen! They're still in the nursery compared to us. Ten million years of absolute power. That's what it takes to be really corrupt.”

7th Doctor:

— “Everyone remotely interesting is mad in some way.”

— “If we fight like animals, we die like animals!”

8th Doctor:

— “Never turn down tea if it's offered to you. That's impolite, and that's how wars start.”

9th Doctor:

— “You lot, you spend all your time thinking about dying, like you're gonna get killed by eggs, or beef, or global warming or asteroids. But you never take time to imagine the impossible... that maybe you survive.”

10th Doctor:

— “[they've got guns] and I haven't. Which makes me the better person, don't you think? They can shoot me dead, but the moral high ground is mine.”

11th Doctor:

— “In 900 years of time and space I've never met anyone who wasn't important before.”

— “The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things. The good things don’t always soften the bad things, but vice versa the bad things don’t always spoil the good things and make them unimportant. And we definitely added to his pile of good things.”

— “Hey, do you mind if I tell you a story? One you might not have heard. All the elements in your body were forged many, many millions of years ago, in the heart of a far away star that exploded and died. That explosion scattered those elements across the desolations of deep space. After so, so many millions of years, these elements came together to form new stars and new planets. And on and on it went. The elements came together and burst apart, forming shoes and ships and sealing wax, and cabbages and kings. Until eventually, they came together to make you.

You might be able to argue that it was directed at the groups he was slurring but unless you follow the idiot or go look for it.. he isn't pushing his moronic bile in your face.

On the second point, words don't cause things to happen. People *use* words to justify the things they cause. Take religion as an example, people cherry pick until they come up with a strand of religion that coincidentally endorses everything they like and disparages everything they don't. 

As for **C**, isn't that the same argument used by people who blame victims of rape for getting raped? If you go burn something down that's on *you*. You made the decision to do that. It's not my fault (because it is out of my control) that there exists people too weak willed to not do terrible things.

&gt; I have one question. Do you think people choose to be bothered by what others say? Do you think someone wants to be gutted by the insults they receive over the internet? If so, then you are sorely mistaken, friend

I think the people we are talking about, the people who saw that tweet and put in the effort to share it with their friends with the express intention of also having them offended, the people who picked up the phone and made a conscious effort to have the kid jailed... I think those people to a large extent choose to be offended.

I, personally, am no offended by much but when I am offended I don't have this ""*Something needs to be done about this!*"" attitude. I just *be offended*. It's not the worst thing in the world and I think the crux of it for me is that *being offended* is a natural part of being a human. By all means try and correct the behaviour, start a discussion.. but don't treat 'being offended' like some kind of ailment that needs to be cut out society or cured.

To bad it is on the forefront of Jose's mind.  To say ""defenders are for defending, attackers are for attacking, you can't have it all"" is one of the grossest oversimplifications of football strategy I've ever heard.

Jose has a system in place: high-pressing, high-tempo, quick counters; and in order for it to work the team needs to be cohesive in their effort.  Mata is not the right kind of cog for that wheel.  He is the reason we looked lackluster until Oscar came off, and since after that move his defensive duties lessoned, he flourished.

When Oscar was on the field Mata had the regular duties assigned to him by Jose, the same ones he assigns all his AMs: press, track back.  If Mata had his druthers, when we are out of possession he would still be trying to find pockets of space in the opposition to spring attacks from once we win the ball.  This is how he was allowed to play the past two seasons.  We don't play that way anymore though, and Mata doesn't have the burst of pace to transition from pressing to attacking as quickly as our other attacking midfielders.

true,sacredstones,null,null,"a lot of people seem to connect Coutinho to Creativity and think that is what we are missing. but I think its more a matter of someone who can keep the ball in the oppositions half. When Coutinho gets the ball, he turns and keeps it in the half. The opposition backs off a bit and we end up possessing the ball in the oppenents half and allowing time for out forwards to get into positions for a pass. Creativity (i define it as extremely good vision and passing technique) helps, but for me, a true 10 is what we are lacking. Someone who will receive the ball in the middle, slip past a challenge, brush off a tackle and suddenly be left with only one opposing CM to deal with. Hendo is the exact opposite of this, and with Moses and Sterling not coming in to support, we had no foundation to build the attack on. We couldn't keep any possession in the middle because Hendo/Gerrard are not comfortable in possession. I really think this is our biggest problem at the moment. When Sturridge would drop deep and keep the ball, it settled the team. When suarez/coutinho does it, it settles the team. Against Hull, we didn't have that kind of player. Suarez couldn't drop deep as much because he was the sole striker and Hull were extremely well organized. Without a true attacking mid, we had no way to get through the wall. 

Lucky for us we have players who can do this in Alberto, Suso, Coutinho, and Allen (kind of), so hopefully we see more of these types of players being used in the future. ",0,1386023396,null,0,false,0,cds0yik,t3_1rwvtn,t1_cds0yik,t3_1rwvtn,null,1428422330,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

On the other hand, we have to really ask what the NHS is and why it should be preserved. Most of the reason the NHS gains favour as opposed to the American system is that it is free at the point of delivery. No poor person is going to end up millions of pounds in debt because they broke their leg, or end up dying because they couldn't afford to see their GP.

But if that is ***all*** we like about the NHS I see no reason why commercial interests can't be involved. Whether you want to believe it or not, the NHS is pretty fucked up from a managerial point of view. The bad thing about governments delivering services are that they tend to be overly bureaucratic and extremely inefficient. The good thing about commercial interests is that they tend to lead to efficient systems.

Just because a service is delivered by a private company, doesn't mean that we will end up with people dying on the street.

http://www.amazon.com/Dr-Who-Eleventh-Doctors-Screwdriver/dp/B003FHXMDC/ref=pd_sim_t_1


The 10th has 2 continuous sonic sounds, and has 2 buttons-- one to be pressed when the screwdriver is retracted, and one when it is extended. It is a pretty simple toy but reasonably accurate to the show. It has two ""tips"", one is a pen and one is UV ink. The UV ink will dry in no time, and I don't really use the pen, so I just keep the UV ink tip as a nonfunctioning part of the toy. The bulb in the screwdriver is UV, so it's a bit of a purplish blue.

The 11th has 4 different sounds, 2 of which are ""hidden"". It definitely has a bit more play value than the 10th because of the spring loaded claw action. The bad part about this is you have to use a bottom mounted button for the sound feature when the sonic is in claw mode-- or you have to use a fingernail to activate the tiny pin button which has moved up the shaft. This screwdriver is much louder than the 10th doctor's screwdriver, and the light is much brighter than the 10th's.

Has Sterling had a good game since December of 2012? I can't remember one, yet he gets the start.

Is Kolo Toure a better option than the £40m of CBs sitting on the bench? Should we really play Skrtel (a right footed player) on the left side of central defense when we have two £20m left-footed center backs on the bench?

What I am sick of is this sub talking up Henderson and Toure like they are the shit when it fact they are at best bench players for us. Henderson *maybe* could start in a holding role if Gerrard is unavailable.

true,microbluemann,null,null,"* Point One

I was speaking on a more general level. This specific incident will likely blow away in a few months. I'd rather address the underlying issue of hate speech, on the internet, **overall**.

I don't have the statistics, but I imagine that the vast majority of people are not offended by hate speech towards groups. Rather than pandering to the teeny-tiny minority of people who care when an offensive slur is tossed out, I'm discussing what has more drastic societal impacts. I know of no cases, in which someone has killed themself over a slur. So why not discuss the real issue, which causes self-killing, in our society?

* Point Two

It seems simply ridiculous to me, that someone would be looking for criticism on the internet - *ooh, here is a good insult to justify my suicide!* - to cherry-pick and justify their death. **A depressed person, if left alone, will not kill themselves for no reason.** The hate speech causes death.

* Point Three

Actually, it is not the same argument used by people who blame rape victims for their misfortunes. Now, I'll admit that my ""crazy psychopath"" example was a poor choice. But the logic still stands.
&gt; It's not my fault (because it is out of my control) that there exists people too weak willed to not do terrible things.

If I am driving drunkenly, late on New Year's Eve, and hit a pedestrian, it is not the pedestrian's fault for being out on a dangerous night, when there would very likely be drunks out. If you incite a tragedy that would not have occurred otherwise, then it is your fault. As I've said, suicide does not occur without a catalyst. If you choose to be that catalyst, the blood is on your hands.

&gt; By all means try and correct the behaviour, start a discussion.. but don't treat 'being offended' like some kind of ailment that needs to be cut out society or cured.

The ""*being offended*"" isn't what I'm worried about. Being offended is healthy. It shouldn't be cured. What does need to be cured is the fact that people act with the express purpose of causing offense. Offense causes a number of unpleasant emotions: shame, embarrassment, anger, sadness. When an individual acts with the express purpose of causing these emotions in another human being, there is a problem.

* Last Words

Hate speech should be protected. I'm not arguing for a censorship of the people. But the hate speaker should not be morally protected, when s/he causes tragedy. Legal protections can exist without problem. But when you step in and say that ""words don't cause things to happen,"" you absolve the murderer of his guilt. Words have a profound impact on the world. We should work to a better future, where words are used for good. The path to this better future is not a justification for those who need to learn the wrongs of their ways.

true,NEWSBOT3,cnty-uk,Londontown,"&gt;    The benchmark study comes from the University of Utah in 2006. A test of 41 adults found that driving while intoxicated was actually less dangerous than driving while talking on a hand-held phone or a hands-free phone. The study found non difference between performance in the hand-held and hands-free conditions, but cellphone users had more crashes than drunk drivers. That was a small study but its results have been repeated.


&gt;    This year, a study at Touro University of 80 drivers found that impairment between drunk drivers and hands-free cellphone drivers was roughly equal.


&gt;    In real life, 24% of all car crashes involve cellphone conversations, according to the National Safety Council.


&gt;    And, if you're still not convinced, the MythBusters crew put the hands-free myth to the test and found that Adam, who tried to conduct a conversation over the phone, did worse on a driving course than Kari, who drove drunk.

true,HugoRune1965,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;Some traffic regulations actually increase the level of risk posed to cyclists by other road users.

&gt;For instance, ignoring a stop line at a red light can, on occasion, make the cyclist far more visible to other road users and give him/her the chance to clear the junction before anyone else.  Sometimes you can filter several hundred yards to the head of a queue of traffic, only to find that the ASL is blocked.  Best to ignore the stop line and park directly in front of the lead vehicle than stay alongside it.  

But stop lines are set back from a junction to allow clearance for long vehicles to turn into the road. So if you are in front of the stop line then you are putting yourself in the path of lorries turning right. 

&gt;Another example is not being able to cycle on standard pavements... 

Apart from a few exceptions, this is still dangerous to pedestrians. 

&gt;Most traffic laws are written for motor vehicles.  For instance, it's illegal to overtake another vehicle in the zigzag area of a pedestrian crossing, but it isn't illegal to overtake a cyclist there, despite the same risks being evident.  

Probably should be illegal too. 

&gt;And it's also illegal to drive on a pavement, but that law is widely flouted and almost never enforced.  But the same people who decry cycling on pavements almost never mention driving on pavements.

I would have thought that most people would assume that this is taken as read.  I didn't think that I need to explicitly state that I don't approve of motor vehicles jumping red lights either.

If you want to agree with every single thing Jose says and does, that's up to you, I don't idolize him in the same respects as many, I rarely look up to anyone, and I take that as an advantage in assessing football.

Good point on the single car units, maybe a 3-car train is better than a 4-car, yes. I just can't see how you build a 'modern' 153 though. By the time you factor in luggage racks, a wheelchair space or two, and an accessible toilet you'd be left with about 60 seats. Plus you have to factor the cab in, do you want a 170 style cab or something like the newer 172s with the corridor connection?

I would agree we need to keep Bombardier Derby in business, we can't keep throwing them orders for 20 EMUs here or there as is happening now.

I'm glad that further electrification is going ahead, but the lines being done now like the Great Western, Midland etc should really have been done after the East Coast 20 years ago. If that had been done, maybe we could now be electrifying regional and rural lines.

true,SeanOrange,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"I was really off-put by the comparative breackneck pace of the new show -- only 45 minutes, and lots of running.  Just an indication of higher production values, mostly.  Doctor Who has gone from being a cult classic to a perennial cash cow for the BBC.

The original show was slow, it was plodding, and it was imagined as a serial where a single story could take up four half hour episodes (sometimes even *six*, ugh).  That format was played with a lot near the end of its original run, but some core facts never changed: low budget, video tape instead of film (again, budget), and just the fact it was a serial drama in the '80s that was produced in the style of, and had many of the trappings of a soap opera.

Doctor Who and action never used to be synonymous.  When they would try to do action, it would just come off kind of silly.  So you saw the characters spend a lot of time chatting with each other (usually locked up in a cell somewhere).  The frenetic energy of the Eccleston Doctor just did not jibe with my memories of Doctor Who or what I expected.  But even as a kid, I would detect boredom creeping in at the corners.  I loved certain episodes, but hated going through specific parts.

Now you get a lot of ""timey whimey"" and handwaving to resolve an episode's plot in the final few minutes.  I found myself hoping early on that they'd do more two-part episodes just so they could sit down and rest a bit more than they have done.  (I feel like The Day of the Doctor 50th Anniversary special benefited *greatly* from the breathing room of its 75 minute run time.)  It wasn't because I found the show exhausting, just... more superficial.  The Doctor Who I knew and loved was about heavy moral and scientific concepts.  New Who relies more on the crutch of ""time travel is magic"" out of plot necessity.  Whenever the pace can be slowed a bit, it seems like a lot more can happen... if that makes sense.

I wouldn't start from the beginning.  I'd jump into a well-planned story arc, like the Key to Time series (Tom Baker), or the Keeper of Traken and Logopolis serials (also Tom Baker).  John Pertwee had some great stories as well, like his Spearhead from Space premiere, or the alternate reality story Inferno.

Actually -- I just looked up inferno, which was broadcast in SEVEN PARTS, totaling nearly three hours.  That's probably the biggest barrier to enjoying old Who: the time investment.  It's really not meant to be shotgunned like a modern series; you really need to pick and choose, and fill in the pieces later.

If he WAS 100%, then Rodgers would have been a fool to not play Skrtel and Agger. Hopefully thats not the case. 


What I can't see or justify is playing Hendo at CAM. Sure, Allen was just coming back from injury and Alberto is untested...but Hendo has also proved to be poor when he's under pressure, which is what the CAM is always surrounded by. Sterling AND moses have both shown miserable workrate defensively. Moses more so than Sterling. Rodgers KNOWS that hendo has extreme workrate and excels on the right. He's proven on the right. His best games are on the right. He should've taken a risk with alberto/allen in the middle and kept Hendo in his best spot at the same time removing a player he knows will have a low workrate (moses/Sterling). Really disappointed in his decisions. He doesn't have MUCH choice given his depth, but he didn't have to play 3 liabilities at once.

Even with Oscar playing well, Chelsea has not looked fluid. Chelsea, at possession, has looked all too predictable. Load up the box and Chelsea will most likely come away with nothing.

true,drakfyre,null,null,"I do agree on the general terms that it is immoral to encourage people to hurt other people.  Heck, I agree on the absolute terms even; I don't think there's *ever* a good reason to hurt people, and for that matter, I don't think there's *ever* a good reason to tell people to hurt people.  I personally try to avoid hurting anyone, even inadvertently, which leads me to censor myself.

Which means, intrinsic to my philosophy, that there's no reason to hurt people who have sent a message encouraging people to hurt eachother.  Nor is there even a reason to hurt people who ACTUALLY hurt eachother.  This is now far, far outside the legal reality we live in, where people who are hurt by someone have the legal right to pursue monetary damages against those who hurt them, and governments have the legal rights to detain, punish, and even kill people who hurt other people.

I am not saying that my philosophy is realistic, by any reckoning.  And that's why it's so important that speech be free.  If laws ARE ""wrong,"" if morals have been thrown to the wayside by a government, people may have to take action into their own hands in order to fix the problems BEFORE things get out of control.  Communication plays a key role in this, and these communications would LIKELY contain threats of force, as the only law greater than the laws of man are the laws that we are (currently) bound by physically: some wounds never heal, and people who die can't come back.

Despite violence being against my own moral codes, the choice to use violence to solve a problem may be the ""right,"" ""just,"" and ""moral"" thing to do.

None of these laws do that - they are about the way you express your opinions.  For example, think about the following situations:

* someone gathering a mob and saying ""I hate &lt;race&gt; so let's start a campaign of violence against them""
* someone saying to a friend ""I hate &lt;race&gt; so you should go and kill that guy over there with this knife""
* someone saying ""I hate &lt;race&gt; so I'm going to kill you""

You want to know what's wrong with Liverpool right now? Steven Gerrard. Take away his dead ball delivery and what have you got? Tactically he's worse than he ever was and in a team that wants to move the ball in quick short passes, he slows the play before trying to ping Hollywood balls out wide. But because he's Gerrard, it's easier to rile against Cissohko for being skinned by Sanga, at Allen for a bad miss, at Moses and Sterling for being outplayed by a compact and resolute hull defence, at Henderson for playing out of position and trying to do his own job and tactically cover Gerrard too.

Giving out is easy as is following the crowd. None of the players being slated since the Arsenal game deserve it. Maybe it's the rise of the internet, maybe it's society. I've witnessed what most people call the best english side ever assembled the Liverpool '88 vintage. I also saw that team replaced by horrendous players (Kosma, Kvarme, Piechnik, Dundee).

I think that he will have a rough start, mainly because he is older. Many people(mostly younger female fans) want a ""cute"" or ""hot"" doctor and care more about eye candy than character.

I think that an older Doctor will get rid of the whole Doctor-Companion romance thing that ruined what could have been good companions(I look at you Martha, and Rose wasn't much better(sorry Rose fans).  But honestly girls, he is a 1000 year old alien.) The Day of the Doctor, and an older Doctor will hopefully serve to eliminate the biggest problems the Doctor has(romance and genocide) and allow the Doctor to again become an adventurer. The pace and style of New Who combined with the Best Friends travelling through Time and Space aspect of classic will be incredible. 

I think that after his initial rough patch, and denial at the loss of Smith, Capaldi will be great. I am hoping that he hides youthfullness beneath a rough exterior. Smith acted young and joked a lot, hiding the fact that he was a sad old man. Capaldi is an older man, but will hopefully exude a playful youthfullness, having the greatest burden of his life lifted off of him. As an older man, he will be easier to take seriously (many people's original issue with Smith, also mentioned by characters within the show), and as we have seen from his other performances, is capable of being mean and cruel when necessary, yet funny and playful at other times. 

I want the 12th Doctor's outfit to reflect these character traits. It should show both his older darker side, and his young, newly freed playful side. Maybe a day cravat in deep green or navy blue and a button down shirt, topped with a 70's style smoking jacket in leather or black velvet. Accesories should be relatively few (he won't find fezzes cool) perhaps just a scarf in deep green or navy blue, but not the same as his day cravat, and not super long. Dark pants, dark dress shoes. His sonic should be sleek and streamlined, with lots of black and silver, Kind of a combination between 4's and 10's",0,1386031520,null,0,false,0,cds483c,t3_1rxudg,t1_cds483c,t3_1rxudg,null,1428420807,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Either way, I've grown up loving soccer above all other sports, and am very glad the MLS is taking off and I can enjoy the growth of the league from a seat among the biggest and loudest fan base in the league (allegedly). 

Since NBC picked up EPL games this year, my friends and I all decided to pick teams to follow to help us fill the void between MLS seasons. I hate the idea of bandwagons, and supporting what people consider the popular teams just because they're popular, so I decided the easiest way to avoid confrontation involving the topic in any way would be to pick a ""middle of the pack"" team. West Ham seemed like a team with some decent potential and you don't have a guy in charge named Big Sam for nothing, so I hoped his influence would generate some positive momentum that I could appreciate. I also tend to appreciate a little adversity when watching sports, because I find that winning (or losing) all the time can get pretty mundane.

Focusing on immigration ignores factors like the stunts pulled with the ~~EU Constitution~~ Lisbon Treaty which angered lots of people, and the disaster of the Euro that vindicated skeptics and created the impression that we're shackled to dysfunctional continent.

There's hundreds of millions of English speaking people outside the UK, while over 10% of England isn't of European origin.

The UK actually has fewer reasons to dislike the EU than many other EU nations.

I have no clue. but you cannot just say the internet is different to the rest of the world, and people cannot be arrested for things they do on it. 

&gt; It's like walking down the street and seeing a little strip of paper with ""Fuck you, cunt"" written on it. It shouldn't make you cry. Are you really such a weak minded person that an anonymous comment collapses your world? Come on.

No it is not. If it was like that then people would react like they do when the see paper on the street.

The difference is that it is traceable back to the person who wrote it. In which case your warning should be. ""Dont post your racist comments where people can trace it back to you if you don't want people to complain about you""

You are the one asking for special privileges on the internet for people too stupid to anonymise there fuckwit hateful speech. 

If I sent all my friends a letter telling them something insane and racist, and one of them thought wow you are  a dick and sent it to the police. Now that is the same as this. Maybe sending me to prison would be an over reaction. But my friends would still have had every right to complain about me.

Also on a practical note. ""don't feed the trolls"" is not something abstract form real life. It is  the internet equivalent of ostracizing a delinquent member of their community. In real life this used to be sending them out in to the woods to be an outlaw. Now is called sending them to prison. 

The analogy should be between a small community where people can effectively self regulate, and with a large one that might need a police force to help. When you were on your small user groups in the 90s then don't feed the trolls works (to an extent). But on twitter I don't see your campaign to ignore racist people getting well enough organised for it to actually work. Maybe I am wrong. But if just ignoring the trolls and filtering your own content was the best way to run a large message board then reddit would not need upvotes and down votes to *filter it for you*.

**Essex County Council responds to interest in story headlined ""Essex removes baby from mother""**

2 December 2013

**Key Dates**

There have been lengthy legal proceedings in this case over the past 15 months.
 
Mother detained under Section 3 of the Mental Health Act on 13 June 2012

Application by the Health Trust to the High Court 23 August 2012

Application for Interim Care Order 24 August 2012

Mother took part in the care proceedings ending on 1 February 2013.

Mother applied to Italian Courts for order to return the child to Italy in May 2013. Those courts ruled that child should remain in England

In October 2013 Essex County Council obtains permission from County Court to place child for adoption
 
**Context**

The Health Trust had been looking after the mother since 13 June 2012 under section 3 of the Mental Health Act. Because of their concerns the Health Trust contacted Essex County Council's Social Services.
 
Five weeks later it was the Health Trust's clinical decision to apply to the High Court for permissions to deliver her unborn baby by caesarean section because of concerns about risks to mother and child.
 
The mother was able to see her baby on the day of birth and the following day. Essex County Council's Social Services obtained an Interim Care Order from the County Court because the mother was too unwell to care for her child.
 
Historically, the mother has two other children which she is unable to care for due to orders made by the Italian authorities.
 
In accordance with Essex County Council's Social Services practice social workers liaised extensively with the extended family before and after the birth of the baby, to establish if anyone  could care for the child.

Hell, there are parents who let their kids do whatever they want full stop. I'm an advocate of free speech but also of balance and looking out for those who either can't look out for themselves or are too young to know better. Parental blocks don't work because chavvy mum who couldn't give a fuck if her kid is watching Cartoon Network or a jihadist beheading online so long as he doesn't bug her during Jeremy Kyle won't use them. And it's kids like that who need guidance more than most.

Broad sweeping opt-in censorship isn't the answer, nor is blatant piggy-backing a bucket list of unwanted anti-government stuff onto that censorship. It's a social issue that won't just go away, especially as net access becomes easier and cheaper and kids are getting more access to hand held devices they can secretly watch in their room, on the toilet, the school bus whatever. As adults we should have the right to filter our own content, but our kids should have the right to be kids, regardless of their background or the ability of the parent to behave responsibly when it comes to keeping tabs on what the kid sees and does online.

Honestly I don't know what the answer is but I think what the govt is attempting is counter productive and will only inflame people's paranoia about creeping attacks on freedom of speech. All I know is that I wouldn't want my kid to watch a Mexican dude getting his head chainsawed off or two girls eating shit out of a cup and I don't want anyone else's kid to either. If not being able to make pointless inflammatory remarks on twitter is the price to pay for innocence then I'd say fuck twitter. But unfortunately govt has a hard on for this whole fucked up anti-activist, pro-corporate surveillance state thing so any attempt at approaching a solution will just end with them abusing the system and pushing through their nasty agendas.

true,Ghwyr,hampshire,Hampshire,"&gt;the NHS is pretty fucked up from a managerial point of view. The bad thing about governments delivering services are that they tend to be overly bureaucratic and extremely inefficient. The good thing about commercial interests is that they tend to lead to efficient systems.

Whilst I totally agree with you that the administrative and managerial structures within the NHS are deeply flawed and wasteful that in itself is not necessarily justification for privatisation/commercialisation. Such commercialisation is not a ""magic pill"" that fixes everything and the commercial partnerships are just as bad and as deeply flawed (if not worse) than the NHS (ATOS, SERCO and G4S for example). What we should be doing is looking to the private sector for guidance and advice, seeing where they are doing better (or worse) and taking those ideas and improvements into the NHS and giving it a full systemic overhaul from the ground up... but importantly keeping it all within the NHS.

At the end of the day why would you break apart sectors of the NHS and place them in the private commercial sector on the (unproven) assumption that can do the job better/cheaper and allow them to make ridiculous profits from that deal (which as we have seen elsewhere they will move offshore and won't pay UK tax on) when we could instead adopt those ""best practices"" from the commercial sector within the NHS and take those financial savings (and would-be profits) and plow that back into improvements within the NHS itself instead of lining someone else's pockets. 

The NHS has it's flaws yes, but commercialisation is not the answer, it needs to be overhauled and to adopt better administrative and managerial practice from the private sector but it needs to do that on it's own terms and be tailored to it's needs. Most importantly the money needs to be kept within the NHS where it will work for the NHS and not in the hands of private companies. 

The NHS is not a commercial organisation, it is there to provide an ""as needed"" service to an endlessly changing and variable clientèle each of whom needs something unique and different from the NHS. No two patients are the same, you never know what they will need or when, or how long it will take to deal with them. Because of that most commercial and business models simply do not apply to the service the NHS provides and as such commercialisation and privatisation are far from simple or effective solutions to the problems the NHS faces.

I think CS did more for cross age interaction than any theme day the school could come up with.

It could also have got a mention during the Starcraft/esport segment. Especially since CS:GO had a $250k ($100k first price) tournament going on when 'How Games Changed the World' aired.

In January 1996, when I was 7, my dad's work moved us to the UK. We were living in Surrey and the first day of school the first question I got asked was 'What team do you support?'  
  
Well I had no real idea. I'd been in the country all of a week and while I had played football for a year or two the concept of supporting a team was something I'd yet to encounter.  
  
So I went home and asked dad and his answer was West Ham. So West Ham became my team. He took me to a bunch of games during the 2 years we lived over here and I fell in love with the club.  

Picture of me at a football training camp.... thing in Surrey

We moved back to Aus at the end of 1997, and while I could no longer follow it like I did, they were always a part of me, whether I was playing FIFA or... whatever.   

I was heartbroken when we were relegated in 03, even though I hadn't been able to see much of the season, and I followed our 2 promotion campaigns as best I could.  

The cup final in 06 was what really brought them back to me as it was on Free To Air. Being able to watch them play in such a huge match meant so much to me and I, like the rest of us, was absolutely devastated at the end of the game.  

A couple of months later we got Foxtel (basically Sky) and I was able to start watching games far more regularly. Further, I turned 18, meaning I could go to watch games at the pub where I discovered the huge West Ham community that exists in [Brisbane](https://www.facebook.com/groups/brisbanehammers/).   

I made some fantastic friends through there and I've had the oppurtunity to watch the Brisbane Group and other groups around Australia grow. The clear highlight was the playoff final in 2012 - an incredible night with 400 Brisbane Hammers packed into our pub (and a decent showing of Blackpool fans too)

I realise this is sorta supposed to be an origin story but I'm gonna bring it up to the present day now just because.  

Anyway, June 2012 I decided I needed a change of scenery. Took my fancy teaching degree and up and moved to London. First thing I did after making that decision was buy a season ticket in the Bobby Moore Lower. I went to all but 4 games last season and had a fantastic time. Couldn't afford a season ticket this year but I've managed to get along to both Cardiff games, the Villa game and our most recent game against Fulham.

I love West Ham and they will always be a part of me. Even when I move back home in the summer I will continue to support them and sing my heart out everytime we all get down the pub.  

Anyway, sorry for getting a bit off topic there.  

Come on you Irons!

true,WooperSlim,null,null,"The Doctor, as far as we know, started out as a renegade:  Stole a TARDIS and left Gallifrey to explore the universe.  Over time, the Time Lords (set on non-interference) decided to use the Doctor as kind of a scape-goat, to allow them to interfere unofficially.

Perhaps the first time he became famous on Gallifrey was when he saved the Time Lords (and the rest of the universe) from Omega, but not sure how publicized his involvement was with that, as he doesn't appear to be famous when he returns to Gallifrey as the 4th Doctor.

The 4th Doctor, to give himself time to prove himself innocent of the assassination of the Time Lord President, decided to run for the presidency.  Skipping ahead, he became the President.  His memory was affected at the end of that, and doesn't seem to recall being President, though Borusa (who later becomes President) and others in their company do.

After Borusa was condemned by Rassilon, the Doctor was appointed by the High Council to be the next President, but after the Doctor ran away, he was deposed.

Then we come to where you *have* seen, and should know that the Doctor became the destroyer and (and revealed in The Day of the Doctor) the Savior of Gallifrey.  As for your question on why the Doctor took it upon himself to end the Time War, really the only explanation we get is from [""Night of the Doctor""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-U3jrS-uhuo) and ""Day of the Doctor"".  The only thing that put him in that position was, as they seem to imply, he's the only one who would do it.

However, there appears to be some aspect of the Doctor that we still aren't aware of:  the biggest of which being, Why is his name a secret?  One woman who knew his name said of the Doctor, ""He is more than just another Time Lord.""  Again with the 7th Doctor, he was once explaining an ancient artifact from the beginning of Time Lord society, the Hand of Omega, and said, ""And didn't we have trouble with the prototype.""  Ace asks, ""we?"" and the Doctor instead says, ""they.""

Once you nationalise a company, they get lazy, stop innovating and focus on providing you the minimun for the maximum cost they can get.

true,DanishPastry,null,null,"I'm not going to address a lot of what you've said because, frankly, I'm having trouble wrapping my head around a lot of it, but there are a couple of things I'd take issue with: 

First, the comparison to a homophobic bully - I think there *is* a difference here. One is targeted abuse, and the other is saying something provocative and distasteful in a public forum. No, if you're being specifically targeted and victimised, walking away isn't an option; but if you're in a public space and happen to come across someone saying something you find disagreeable, then it really, really is - or, as OP said, you could talk to whoever manages that public space and have them limit the person's ability to say hurtful things in the future (this is the kind of self-governance that I *think* you're advocating for the internet). 

Secondly, unpleasant as you might find it, freedom of speech *does* entail the right to say cruel, hurtful, discriminatory, or otherwise offensive things because, to paraphrase what you said, arbitrarily deciding what the fuck ""acceptable speech"" is is just as repressive, it's just a different sort of repression. Make no mistake; any line you try to draw between 'acceptable' and 'unacceptable' will, ultimately, be arbitrary. God knows, I find a lot of UKIP and the BNP's rhetoric disagreeable, but I'm not going to deprive them of the right to say it, because not everyone agrees with some of the things *I* say, and goddamn I do not want to lose the right to speak my mind. I mean, you accuse OP of ""claiming to champion freedom while glorifying your version of freedom and only that version"" but, really, how is what you're doing any different? 

No one is saying that people don't have a right to their emotions. No one is is saying that people don't have a right to be offended, or take issue with other people's opinions. The law, however, does not, and can not take offense; it is impersonal, and people should strive to remember that it is not there to soothe their stinging ego when someone says something they don't like. 

(I take issue with your attitude towards ""the people who aren't as emotionally or intellectually stable"" as well - it seems very condescending, and you seem to be using them as justification for dictating how everyone else should behave - but that's largely besides the point).

true,therosseverett,null,null,"For some reason it took the text from my tumblr post and made it one giant paragraph. Here's the piece with line breaks:

The candles on the menorah always casted a glow that captivated Laurie much in the way she imagined the snake charmer’s tune entranced a cobra. She swayed a bit with the flames. The soft cacophony of her family in the other room played a nice background noise to her inner thoughts.

She pinched her toes in her new Ugg slippers. Normally she didn’t like the smaller Hanukkah gifts, but it was hard to argue with her feet when they felt like they were experiencing love for the first time. Alone in the kitchen, she took a deep breath as if to savor the peace and solitude of the moment before she would be called to return to the living room where the rest of her family waited for her to start their game of Monopoly.

She took out her phone and started flipping through her JDate app; no one good. Her brother Alan had brought his girlfriend Rachel home with him this year and her mother’s inquiring glances wouldn’t let her hear the end of it. She placed her phone down on the table in defeat and stood up, wondering to herself if anyone had chosen the hat token as their piece yet.

Bzzzz. Bzzzz. She turned to her phone to see who texted her, but the screen remained unlit. “That’s odd,” the buzzing continued. Getting louder and louder, until it wasn’t buzzing anymore, but almost a whirring. A whooshing.

WHOOSH. WHOOSH WHOOSH.

She covered her ears. Loud noises gave her headaches. In front of her, as if out of thin air, a blue Police box materialized right in her kitchen, next to the island (granite counter tops, stainless steel utilities, recently updated; very nice, really).

Normally very communicative and articulate, Laurie was speechless; which was a first. What was this in front of her? Was she high? Yes, a little. The door to the blue box opened and out stepped a man with a tuft of straight brown hair and an awful bowtie that immediately distracted her from the whole situation.

“Ew.” Laurie spoke finally.

“Ew?” said the man in an English accent that caught Laurie off guard. She looked in his eyes and decided he was cute enough and English enough that she could forgive the bowtie, at least temporarily.

“Who are you?” asked Laurie.

“I’m the Doctor,” said the Doctor.

“You’re a doctor?” Laurie lit up.

“I’m the Doctor, actually,” corrected the Doctor.

“What kind of Doctor?” Laurie was cautiously optimistic.

“Well, it’s a bit complicated,” started the Doctor.

“Oh, I get it, you had more than one specialty. It’s okay, my dad’s a podiatrist and an orthopedist. He runs his own practice,” Laurie interrupted. The man didn’t seem to be with anybody; no ring on his finger. “Did you come here alone? No girlfriend or… wife?” Laurie tried to peek around and see inside the mysterious box.

“Just me, I’m afraid. I’m traveling alone for the time being,” The Doctor started to do some looking around of his own. He made his way over to the leftover food on the buffet. He smelled a latke.

“What’s this box?” Laurie snooped around it, “It looks like a changing room at Macy’s.”

“That is my TARDIS.”

“Is that German?”

“No, it’s Gallifreyan.”

“Ah. My dad drives a Tesla.”

Laurie was perplexed. She’d never seen such a weird car before; much less one that could appear out of nowhere. This Doctor must be really successful, she thought. Discretely, she adjusted her bra.

“So, what brings you here?” Laurie batted her eyes at the handsome Doctor.

“Funny you should ask that, actually,” the Doctor turned his attention to Laurie. He thinks I’m funny, she thought.

“It seems the lights from your menorah, right there, attracted me here.”

He thinks I’m attractive! She deducted.

“My TARDIS seems to think that this is a place I need to be, but apparently it brought me to the wrong point in time. You see, the TARDIS can travel through space and time. Say, how would you like to come along with me?” asked the Doctor.

“Yes. Mom! I’m going with a Doctor to travel!” yelled Laurie.

“Finally!” yelled her mother from the other room.
“Wait, don’t you want to know any more about what’s going on?” the Doctor spun to Laurie who was already at the door of the TARDIS.

“Nah, not really. Let’s go. Does this thing have seat warmers?” Laurie tried to open the door as her mom came into the kitchen holding a nice down jacket.

“Laurie, honey, take this jacket, it’s cold.”

“Mom! Not now.”

“Where are you going? Will it be cold?” her mother was concerned.

“I don’t know, Mom. I’m going through space and time.” Laurie whined back.

Laurie’s mother pushed past the bewildered Doctor, a man thousands of years old who was not entirely sure what he was being witness to.

“Just take it, space and time sounds cold. Are you gonna need a snack for the ride?” Laurie’s mother forced the jacket upon Laurie who begrudgingly took it.

“No, we’ll stop along the way,” assured Laurie.

“Actually, time travel happens instantaneously, and while we won’t be able to stop for food, it will only feel like a couple of minutes,” Interjected the Doctor. Laurie’s mother turned and looked at the Doctor for the first time. She sized him up.

“You look thin. Just take some kugel and a turkey leg,” insisted Laurie’s mother. “I have some matzo ball soup frozen that you can bring. Let me just defrost it.”

“That really won’t be necessary-“ the Doctor feebly attempted to dissuade Laurie’s mother.

“Nonsense, it’ll just take a second,” she had already put the bag in the microwave. She pressed a few buttons, but stalled on the last one. “Ugh, this damn microwave. You know, I told your father it was going to break on us one of these days and lo and behold: phhbbbllttt,” she stuck out her tongue, “And when we have company, nonetheless. So is my life!”

“Allow me,” the Doctor pulled what looked to be a long metallic cylinder out of his breast pocket and pointed it at the microwave.

“What is that, a gun?” Laurie’s mother pulled back. The Doctor looked at the object in his hand.

“This? Oh no, it’s my sonic screwdriver. That should do it.” The microwave whirred to life as Laurie’s mother shot an impressed look to Laurie.

“He’s handy, too!” she declared. The soup thawed slowly. They waited in what the Doctor considered an uncomfortable silence for seconds.

“So what kind of doctor are you?” prodded Laurie’s mother.

“It doesn’t really work like that,” the Doctor answered patiently.
“My husband has this thing on his leg, do you think you could take a look at it? MARTY!” she called to the other room. “It’s the size of an egg, we have no idea what it is. MARTY! Come in here!”
“Mom, he doesn’t want to look at Dad’s leg,” insisted Laurie.

“Do you know David Zucker?” continued Laurie’s mother.

“Mom, ohmigod stoppit,” Laurie pleaded.

“Laurie and him went to Brandeis together. Between you and me I think she had a little crush on him,” Laurie’s mom whispered the last part.

“I’m afraid I haven’t had the pleasure,” the Doctor was starting to wonder if he had made a mistake in coming here.

“He’s a handsome boy. Good family. Are you married?” Laurie’s mother was inches from the Doctor.

“You know, I really should be going,” the Doctor attempted to squeeze past Laurie and her mother. DING! The microwave signaled that the soup was ready.

“Okay, here you go you two. Will you call me when you get where you’re going?” Laurie’s mother took the soup out from the microwave.

“Yes,” reassured Laurie as if it was being imposed upon her. It was. “We’re going to have to call her when we get to space and time, okay?”

“Actually, Laurie, I think it might be best if you stay here.” The Doctor, now in a bit of a panic pressed himself toward the TARDIS between Laurie and the island, which, again, was topped by some very nice granite.

“But… I thought I was coming with you. You said we were going to travel and you were going to get me a hand bag,” Laurie’s worry was causing her voice to rise to an octave that would make a dog wince.

“I never said anything about a bag and on second thought it might be too dangerous,” back-peddled the Doctor, “For me.” He snapped his fingers and the TARDIS door shot open allowing him to leap inside.

“Do you see that, Laurie. It doesn’t look like much but it’s so much bigger on the inside. The décor isn’t great, but look at the open space. A nice area rug could go a long way.” The TARDIS door snapped shut as Laurie banged her hands against it, desperately clawing to get in.

“I have air miles, can I meet you somewhere?” Laurie begged. The whirring started again and the TARDIS slowly disappeared from their view. A defeated Laurie looked on the floor where the Doctor’s blue box once stood.

“What was that?” Laurie’s mother was taken aback.

“That was his TARDIS.”

“Sounds German,” concluded Laurie’s mother. “You’re better off. Come now, we’re waiting on you for Monopoly. I’m the hat.” Laurie’s mother headed back to the living room with Laurie walking sadly in tow, a tear dropping onto her new Uggs. This night couldn’t be any worse.

Censorship is the bread and butter of feminism. It's in a woman's emotional nature to get butthurt and offended when her views are criticized because like an immature child, she becomes emotionally attached to everything.

Nevertheless, the negative media coverage in order to generate public dissatisfaction has undoubtedly been in action for at least the last year, most notably by The Times. Why is this I wonder? A) The Times is considered respectable enough to influence public opinion from even your average middle ground voter. B) it is owned by a man who will undoubtedly benefit from the contracts on offer from even semi-privatisation.

News International have put the NHS on a road to hyper-accountability, shamelessly exploiting any skewed facts they get their hands on to undermine its services. In reality, as a result, the NHS is as transparent and under-pressure as ever, and by nature this probably leads to increased performance!

In sum, I'd argue that News International (and obviously the Mail, but I think that is down to ideology and populism rather than ulterior motive) have actually indirectly helped increase the quality of service provided by the NHS (or at least will in the long run), yet have also managed to reduce the public's opinion of it.

The government/Murdoch media (some might argue more-or-less the same thing) have also likely been lobbying the BBC, because at least until recently, there was a serious lack of impartiality regarding it's coverage of the NHS.
