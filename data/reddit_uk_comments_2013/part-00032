If the Labour government hadn't pissed all the money up the wall that they inherited from the previous Conservative government, then we would of been able to apply keynesian style stimuli to the economy *now*. Rather then spending all of the money *then* and basking in the glory of an economy that grew not through sound governance, but through debt. Debt that my generation and future generations will have to pay for, which will reduce our standard of living.

However, since there is no money, the governments only real option is to cut services, all of which creates uncertainty.

true,7zark77,eng-GreaterLondon,London,"Endorsing forced labour - or working out a system where people earn skills to get a job? Do you really think it is healthy to give people money and expect NOTHING in return? Please explain to me how that is (a) most importantly helping the person seeking a job and (b) helping society? 

Yes, this requires a massive overhaul of so many things, from the education system to the welfare system to employment law, but I think it's a given that the so-called benefits culture is not healthy. 

The problem is, any solution that anyone tries to present is immediately met with cries of 'exploitation' and this in turn keeps the same jobseekers in the exact same position, with no skills, and no job. 

I also don't think it's the job of the government to pay the wages of private companies, so disagree with you that they should pay more JSA. 

I think they should return to a system along the lines of the YTS - applicants get paid a small wage, but there is a structured 3 - 6 months training scheme with a reputable company. There might be a job at the end of it, there might not, but the person leaves with real skills. My sister did one in the 1980s, and she remains with the same company 30 years on, and has a great job. There will be winners and losers, but what's important are the skills.

* it adds variety to their diet (in taste terms)
* they are confident that it isn't harmful (as a result of the law)

I'm sure they still eat plenty of vegetables - it's just that nobody really wants to *have* to eat vegetables 24/7/365. It's pretty depressing. Adding some cheap mince now and again probably livens that up somewhat.

In this case, the beef has been completely falsely advertised and may even contain dangerous contaminants. That is illegal.

&gt; The problem is systemic, why can't people in a supposedly advanced civilised industrialised Western nation afford to eat decent food when the vast majority of people from much much poorer developing nations can?

This is simply untrue. A huge number of people in poor countries are malnourished in some fashion, and I would be very interested to see any statistics supporting the idea that the 'vast majority' of people eat better than in the Western world. If you aren't eating meat because you can't afford it, that isn't good for you. Humans are omnivorous and meat contains several nutritional components that are much more difficult to get from vegetables. 

Problems in nutrition come from two different angles depending on where you live: in rich countries the problem is that people eat too much and become obese. In poor countries that problem is that people don't eat enough or can't get the right nutrients. When we (in the west) associate vegetables with being healthy, it's because they contain fewer calories and so make you less fat. On the other hand, in poor countries, the problem is that many people can't afford to eat much else than vegetables and rice. This is *also* a bad thing. Being limited to a small selection of foods is bad for you as well.

**tl;dr** people buy that mince to make their lives a little bit less depressing, safe in the knowledge that at least it won't harm them. Vegetables do not magically equal good.",0,1361117841,null,0,false,0,c8gp6a2,t3_18ow96,t1_c8gp6a2,t1_c8got5l,null,1431319882,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

She doesn't need to change the law, the government loves and fully agrees with the existing law. The existing law is fine, it doesn't need changing.

The issue the government has is that judges are implementing the law selectively and not the whole law, the law clearly states *(Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights)* that if a foreign citizen is likely to reoffend or represents a danger to any citizens, then the judge must deport them, even if they have a family here. That need to protect citizens is very clearly laid out in the law, and supersedes the family bit but the judges are selectively ignoring it. 

No new laws are needed, the government just needs to get Parliament to pass a motion telling judges to enforce the whole law and stop being selective, because that's not how law works. This is the reason for all the confusion with people not understanding why new law doesn't to be made etc.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"&gt; This is a common misconception, it may surprise you that benefit spending as a share of GDP fell during the first 11 years of the last Labour government; it only began to rise in 2008, after the financial crash, as hundreds of thousands of Britons found themselves out of work through no fault of their own. http://www.turn2us.org.uk/pdf/Mythbusting.pdf

Yes, I don't disagree with you, of course I don't think unemployment benefits were rising through the New Labour period, because after all unemployment was going down. Although all welfare including pensions and tax credits will have risen. What I was saying is that they rose after the recession, and the cuts have reduced the growth.

This comes back to what's most fair against what's most effective. You have a structural deficit going into a recession, tax revenue goes down, unemployment benefits go onto a new plateau, you have a certain amount extra that can be borrowed, and in subsequent years benefits, uprated with inflation, are rising faster than GDP or revenues. This is the fairest thing to do, but it means the books can't be balanced. So you introduce departmental cuts, but that means that cuts fall on the services which poor people rely on most, and job losses on those who are predominantly employed in the public sector - people in depressed Northern towns and cities, and women. Still, there's little money for infrastructure spending, which will not only introduce demand, but also increase the efficiency of the economy. This is a vicious circle, and the only way out of it is to redirect some money (the amount is subject to debate) from what's immediately most fair to what's most productive.

What annoys me is that they don't realize, or at least don't publicly accept, that there's no way to simultaneously satisfy all of these demands. They pull in all directions, and what you're trying to find is an equitable balance. The situation is at root unfair, and we're talking about more competent management, or about marginal shifts, but people still pretend as if the government has a magic wand which it is refusing to use, presumably out of spite.",0,1361118408,null,0,1361118750,0,c8gpau6,t3_18muj9,t1_c8gpau6,t1_c8gkwt5,null,1431319940,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

This would completely defeat the point of any content protection, and therefore a Content Decryption Module should be able to identify if the operating system supports such features and either flag to the operating system that it should seek a flag and enable/disable the feature as appropriate, or refuse to play the video. We feel that it would be helpful if the specification was able to specifically identify errors relating to this usage case.

No, that's true...on the other hand, it's perfectly possible to eat rat/dog/cat/etc. meat without harmful effect.

&gt;they are confident that it isn't harmful (as a result of the law)

Not any more it would seem.

&gt;it's just that nobody really wants to have to eat vegetables 24/7/365.

Erm, in fact, many people do, and a substantial proportion of the world has to.  I'm not advocating vegetarianism, but eating less meat is certainly a good, wholesome and healthy option for many people, which needn't be boring or unappetising, and is certainly something the vast majority of the world's population are forced to do.

&gt;Adding some cheap mince now and again probably livens that up somewhat.

If you're doing it only now and again you can afford to be more picky.

&gt;the beef has been completely falsely advertised and may even contain dangerous contaminants.

Absolutely, prosecute the fuck out of them (I doubt they will though!)

&gt;This is simply untrue. A huge number of people in poor countries are malnourished in some fashion, and I would be very interested to see any statistics supporting the idea that the 'vast majority' of people eat better than in the Western world.

I can't provide you data, but I live in Vietnam, admittedly in a relatively wealthy part (Saigon), and I guarantee you the average family here is dining on much more healthy organic food, including meat, than the average family in the UK.  But it is changing...

Probably, but shorter supply chains, and much greater and more intimate knowledge of suppliers prevented it.

&gt;If most of the market moved to buying 'higher quality' meat, the incentive to cheat would move to that segment of the market. It's simply about the money. The perceived quality of the product offers no protection whatsoever.

To a degree I agree, but there are other important factors, like industrial farming, long international supply chains to countries with crappy consumer protection, anonymity of suppliers, failures in tracking, poor animal welfare, chemical adulteration, high pressures on and low profit margins for growers/originators, the supermarket supply model, etc.",0,1361119132,null,0,false,0,c8gpgqh,t3_18ow96,t1_c8gpgqh,t1_c8gp9xb,null,1431320024,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Is an awesome formation. Coutinho occasionally joining the front 3, letting Suarez find space behind the striker when he can, sturridge goes wide when he can. Apart from Downing keeping it simple on the right hand side, the fluidity from this formation has been the key to our success today.

true,gaudini,null,null,"Maybe I can bring a slightly different perspective, as I actually started watching the series at season 5. True, it's a break from the past, but it also provides a good jumping-on point for new viewers, like me. I see it kind of like the problem a lot of comic books have -- they accumulate a lot of complex backstory that fans love, but that makes it seem prohibitive for new readers (or, in this case, viewers).

In fact, my friend who got me into Doctor Who sold me on ""look, you enjoyed Stephen Moffat's 'Sherlock,' just try out 'Doctor Who' since he's now head writer. You can jump on with the Eleventh Doctor, and if you don't like it, you can stop. If you like it, you can go back and watch the rest."" And that's what I did.

Don't get me wrong, I love the Ninth and Tenth Doctors, but I'm still not sure what I would have done if I hadn't been hooked by the Eleventh, mainly because (as much as Christopher Eccleston is probably my second favorite of the new three Doctors, after Matt Smith), the Ninth Doctor's season takes a little time to really find itself, which is natural for new/re-boot shows, and I had a couple other shows on my 'to-watch' list.

What I do know is that I enjoyed seasons 5 and 6 so much that I went back and watched it straight from Christopher Eccleston, and then moved onto Classic Who.

So, I'm glad they provided me that jumping on point where the viewer can pick up the show and not feel like they have to go through 4 other seasons first, because it's what got me into Doctor Who. I know a lot of other fans might disagree with this, but I think its a good move for introducing the show non-Whovians.

1+2: I agree, those meats aren't harmful. The problem is that it was falsely advertised, and as such those people should be prosecuted. If we were more vigilant in enforcing our own regulations, this wouldn't have been a problem by default.

3: A large number of people are vegetarians, but [certainly not a majority](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism_by_country). Humans aren't really meant to never eat meat, and so there are a few nutrients that we need that are most commonly present in meat. [This article](http://www.medicinenet.com/vegetarian_and_vegan_diet/page2.htm) lists a few of the major ones. Of course it's possible to get them from other sources, but this is more difficult and the specific foods required may be more costly. As a result, an optimally healthy fully vegetarian diet is still ruled out for those poor people who can only afford to eat vegetables.

4: But if they were picky, they would have to eat meat even less often. On top of that, there's no apparent return on their investment. Assuming that all products are legally produced, they don't get anything extra apart from slight moral smugness when they buy more expensive meat. If you're trying to feed your children on a low budget, I doubt that's something that you are worried about.

5: Yes, they should be prosecuted, and hopefully will be. It's too early to make assumptions but I think the weight of public outrage will ensure prosecution here.

6: Studies have suggested that 
&gt;there is no evidence of a difference in nutrient quality between organically and conventionally produced foodstuffs

See [this article](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/no-health-benefits-from-organic-food/) for a range of supporting studies. The first link (to the systematic review) is probably the most pertinent.

Article 8 is a qualified right. That means that the state can interfere with it, but there needs to be justification in order for that interference to be lawful.

This means that in every case, the judge must undertake a balancing exercise, by trying to balance the interests of wider society (public safety, the prevention of disorder or crime, the protection of the rights and freedoms of others) against the rights of the individual.

Obviously, in some cases the balance will favour wider society (in which case, deportation), and in other cases, it will favour the individual (in which case, no deportation).

Hence the law does indeed ""allow"" deportation, as you say. But there is a difference between 'allow' and 'require'; just because the law allows someone to do something, doesn't mean the law says they have to do it.

Thing is, there's a lot of ignorance in your comment, but there needn't be. All of this is freely and easily accessible on the web. Can I suggest that you have a look at [bailii](http://www.bailii.org)? Try doing a case law search using the terms 'article 8' + 'deport'.

Based on what I remember from studying the Sexual Offences Act, those allegations would be sexual assault (or possibly common assault), rape, sexual assault, and rape.

The key argument with all of those will be the issue of consent. The Swedish prosecutors are saying there wasn't consent, Assange is saying there was. That is thus a matter for trial.

Technically penetrating someone while they're asleep (count 4) isn't *definitely* illegal; it *can* be illegal or not. Being asleep creates an ""[evidential presumption](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/75)"" that there isn't consent, meaning it shifts the burden onto the defendant to prove there was.

The lack of a condom is significant if consent to sex was given on the condition that a condom was used. Therefore the consent is taken to be withdrawn if there isn't one.

&gt; What about when those countries decide that asylum is available to anybody making a six figure donation or something like that?

Has Assange offered a six figure sum? Why muddy the waters? Anyway, from a cursory look you are an agitator against Assange. That's fine but you also seem to want to promote the idea of a wronged justice system, yet pick arbitrarily which to give priority. You are putting Swedish law ahead of international law and Ecuadorean sovereignty.

Now to this ""evading"" justice: the sentencing range for the ""minor rape"" accusation is 0-4 years. ""Ordinary rape"" is that which used force bun not violence, a minimum of 2 years would have been served, and this was the original accusation but was down graded through lack of evidence. If the witness statements even those edited by the police were found to be enough for conviction the probably sentence if Assange is unlucky is 2 years. That's shorter than time already served under quasi-house arrest, arrest and time sheltering in the Ecuadorean embassy. It wouldn't have cost Assange 600k in legal fees (just for the first lawyer) and 100k of collective bail monies either. He could have already served his sentence and be back out on the streets. That would have been the rational decision **even if guilty** unless there is a greater threat, a more grave worst case scenario—perhaps an administrative clique that wants to hunt him down like a hi-tech terrorist.

And back to Assange. The fundamental issue is that he hasn't ""escape"" the justice system, he's just not in the one you want. There is of course the greater question: what do you do when a ""justice"" system seems to have been corrupted? Remember it was the Swedish police that leaked Assange case to the press, and that's how the identity of one woman got out.

I think Coutinho pretty damn well, looking forward to see more of him.

I'm a bit disappointed with Borini, mainly because he came on fresh against very tired and demoralised defenders, but didn't chase after the ball and pressure the defenders like Sturridge and Suarez. He's content to sit in front of their back four and wait.

Allen seems to slow games down a lot, he doesn't seem confident enough to bring the ball forward or to make a probing pass. He looks forward, sees one or two white shirts, turns back and passes it to Agger/Carra or sideways to Gerrard. The difference between him and Lucas when it comes to distribution is that Lucas makes simple passes as well, but he always looks forward.

Sturridge was fantastic today, very clever with his feet, turning away from defenders or doing fancy flicks. Unlucky not to get his goal earlier. We really rely on him to be the goal threat, in the first half he was the only one that put himself in positions to score.

Suarez... what can I say? Brilliant performance. Him and Sturridge work very very well together. MoTM, no question.

Gerrard was good as well, pulling the strings in midfield, but I think he could have played better. Or maybe the other players just made him look average.

Downing's game was like Gerrard's. Pretty good, but I'm sure he can do better.

Johnson and Enrique were brilliant. They were pretty much wingers the way they were both playing, especially Johnson. When Borini was off he was like a bloody striker, making Sturridge-esque off the shoulder runs down the right. Enrique had a good goal, and powered forward well when necessary.

Defenders, not much to say about. Good distribution, I guess. I was quite impressed by that one run Agger made forward in the first half, around the centre-left, faked a shot and then gave it to Suarez in a good position. Carra did well as well, making vital interceptions

Reina is the same, not much to talk about. Good distribution as well, I suppose.

Henderson was lively as usual, ready to meet any player holding on to the ball to make sure nothing dangerous comes of it.

For the publicity. Ecuador has a rather spotty reputation when it comes to upholding freedom of expression (not that other places don't), and this was a nice distraction. Plus it's a fairly simple way of being rude to the UK. They may be regretting this decision now...

&gt; An Icelandic MP was advised by her administration not to travel to the US lest she faced prosecution because her association with Wikileaks.

Right, which sort of makes sense. But there's a difference between ""if you've annoyed the US, don't go there"" and ""hide in London because the US is coming to get you!""

&gt; It makes no difference whether he is under the care of the Swedish or British authorities they seek the same end, so he asked Ecuador for political asylum and it was granted. He didn't walk into the Foreign Office.

The problem with this is that it involves a bit of re-writing of history. Assange *did* walk into the UK, and *did* get his (then) solicitor to go to the UK police to let him know (a) he was there, and (b) how to get in touch if a valid arrest warrant was made. He then voluntarily surrendered to the English courts when the warrant was issued, and stayed within his bail conditions during the 18ish months his trial was going on. It wasn't until a couple of weeks after his final appeal was rejected (and a few days before he was going to be sent to Sweden) that he seemed to suddenly decide the English authorities couldn't be trusted and that he needed to flee to Ecuador.

That doesn't strike me as the actions of someone who is afraid of the English justice system, but of someone who doesn't want to face trial in Sweden (for whatever reason).",0,1361120946,null,0,false,0,c8gpvos,t3_18n9sd,t1_c8gpvos,t1_c8gnkrs,null,1431320211,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Funny, all other Assange apologists seem to think so.

&gt;Assange wants to set up Wikileaks in Sweden but the reason for the denial is kept confidential.

Just for clarity: Assange was not denied setting up Wikileaks in Sweden. He was however denied residency.

&gt;Suddenly he's turned into a serial rapist

No he's not. There's only one accusation of rape, so unless you consider a series of one a proper series, he was not turned into a ""serial rapist""

&gt;VP Joe Biden is calling him a ""hi-tech terrorist""

Irrelevant. Biden is the VP of neither Sweden nor Britain. It's only relevant if you already assume that the US is involved.
  
&gt;Palin what's him to be ""hunted down like Osama Bin Laden"".

Even less relevant for natural reasons.

&gt;Before I got into politics I'd have been surprised to learn that Sweden was part of the clandestine torture operations of the US.

Is there a time table for when the two Egyptians won't be a ""relevant"" argument any more?

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;those meats aren't harmful. The problem is that it was falsely advertised, and as such those people should be prosecuted.

Agree on all this.

&gt;If we were more vigilant in enforcing our own regulations, this wouldn't have been a problem by default.

Doubt this though.

&gt;A large number of people are vegetarians, but certainly not a majority.

Well, I don't see that as a particularly good nor thorough source and it doesn't provide much numerical data, just  few factoids and snippets and opinions.  But, more importantly, I said specifically, I wasn't saying anything about vegetarianism, just the fact that most of the world eats a lot less meat than Brits do!  The entry on China is a case in point.  The Chinese aren't vegetarian at all, they will eat many meats we'd freak out at, but as a percentage of their diet it's much much lower.  Same in Vietnam.

&gt;Humans aren't really meant to never eat meat, and so there are a few nutrients that we need that are most commonly present in meat. This article lists a few of the major ones. Of course it's possible to get them from other sources, but this is more difficult and the specific foods required may be more costly. As a result, an optimally healthy fully vegetarian diet is still ruled out for those poor people who can only afford to eat vegetables.

Yup, we're omnivores, I'm not making the case we're vegetarians.  We could be if we chose, but you're right, it requires effort and sacrifice from the PoV of someone who eats meat.  I eat meat, I'm not being hypocritical on this.  But we could choose to be less intensive meat eaters, we could respect animals more and reduce the proportion of our diet which is meat.  If we did that, animal welfare would improve, our health would improve, poor people's lives would improve, economic development might improve, and the quality of meat could improve too.

&gt;there's no apparent return on their investment.

Of course there is.  There's very good evidence lower meat diets are healthier.  Add to that the better quality of the meat they'd be consuming (and the addtional money they could spend on things which improve health like better oils, nuts, fresh fruit, all good).

On number 6, I'm not promoting organic specifically, but I'm very dubious of some of the research which has been output by corporate funded departments saying that industrially produced food with loads of toxins is just as good as food produced the way food has been through history.  It's hardly impartial.

On the Vietnamese malnutrition thing, certainly not going to deny there is poverty and malnutrition, particularly in certain parts of the country.  But overall, and bearing in mind the political agendas of some of those organisations which talk about ""development"", I'd say the diet for people who have access to the modal wage here is good*, can the same be said for the UK?  The modal wage in the UK is what? 15,000 pounds?

On the downvoter, don't sweat it.  I'm well used to my stalkers and those who like to downvote anything which presents a view they don't agree with or just follow the herd - upvoted = upvote, downvoted = downvote.

true,[deleted],null,null,"35k is the average household income, I should have been clearer (if I was to use the average personal the average donation would be even lower). A fact for you: 31% of households live on up to 15k, so yes any average about wealth is misleading. In that light 50k for some books is a bit obscene, perhaps for anything it is a bit obscene considering the relative and real poverty. 

You are also forgetting something, people using libraries are sharing a single copy. More maths: there are 4500 public libraries in the uk. Let's say that each bought a copy at 5£ for his latest book. That's 22.5k up front plus the 6k. This guy is suffering entitlement. Why should we cut more trees down, use more oil, have more underpaid workers at Amazon, just because he thinks his vastly above typical income is not good enough?

&gt;Surely he can't use flattr through British Libraries?

Why not? He could use kickstarter as well, get the money upfront and release the book for free and be ""flattred"" ever after. He could do book signings... there's plenty of room for innovation, he's just being a typical liberal that wants all the freedom for himself whilst denying the people the right to organise and share cultural wealth.

&gt; His point is that when 500k people borrow his books he makes **£6,600 which isn't right**. There should be a cap, I agree, but it should be closer to £50k, which is a fair salary to someone providing intellectual content to half a million people.

I find this appalling actually. The implication is that he would change his mind about shuttering the library system if he had greater state handouts. He's basing his moral judgements, and so are you highlighted in bold, on personal financial gain. Remember, 7p is the low average. 500k readers, 35k decide to donate a pound. The cake can be split many ways. The point is he already has an audience, time to innovate rather being lazy and on the offensive.

TPB never broke any swedish laws whatsoever. It was not illegal to share movies/music/games online when they got raided.


&gt;There is no proof that the US is involved.

US is the global police, you see. They can do what they want to do. Another case would be that of British student Richard O'Dwyer. He shared links to some american TV shows, so US nearly managed to get an extradition order from the UK courts, even though the kid has never been to US, never did anything directly related to US, never hosted any material that belonged to anyone in US.

Yet it was pretty close to him being sent there against his will and then being killed in jail. 

Same with Assange and those girls, it's all just a silly excuse in order to get him. US can't simply say ""He fucked our shit up, so we will kill him. Give him to us."" Yet remember how all payments were blocked, how PayPal, Visa, Mastercard and others froze his accounts? You think they did it for fun, all by themselves? If that doesn't make you think that US government is behind the whole deal, then I don't know what will.

So you claim that there are no obvious connections to US, yet the article says:

&gt;Fearing that upon his extradition to Sweden he would be immediately re-extradited to the US – where his lawyers say he may face the death penalty – Assange fled his house and requested political asylum from Ecuador.

Yeah, I feel that it's less than he deserves based on the impact his books have, and so does he.  When people strike over pay, and they only earn £10k, everyone's sympathetic, but this guy only earns £6.6k a year from a distribution of 500,000 and you find his complaints appalling.

He's entitled to feel aggrieved at the way that libraries reimburse authors IMO and I'm sure that a lot of people feel the same. People have this belief that authors should write for their product to be loved, rather than financial gain, but it's still his job.

Assange tries several times over the course of a month to get the Swedish authorities to interview him before he leaves the country, and they don't want to talk to him. Suddenly when they decide they do want to talk to him, they feel they need to issue an interpol red notice to do so.

Assange still agrees to be interviewed over the phone or video chat, and Sweden declines, despite allowing the same thing for other, more violent, criminals.

Now Britan is spending gobs of money over this, when either of these governments could pay for a plane ticket to send a someone over to interview him in person if they really insisted on taking things this far.

Over what?

One woman who he had consensual sex with multiple times complained that he did it again once while she was asleep, and that he paid more attention to his computer than her.

Another woman who he also was having consensual sex complained about a condom breaking. This woman has since left Sweden and is reportedly refusing to cooperate with authorities anymore.

Yes, they did.

&gt;US is the global police, you see. They can do what they want to do. Another case would be that of British student Richard O'Dwyer. He shared links to some american TV shows, so US nearly managed to get an extradition order from the UK courts, even though the kid has never been to US, never did anything directly related to US, never hosted any material that belonged to anyone in US.

That is not proof, it's just empty assertions.

&gt;Same with Assange and those girls, it's all just a silly excuse in order to get him. US can't simply say ""He fucked our shit up, so we will kill him. Give him to us.""

But they can say ""He fucked your women, so we will kill him. give him to us.""? That makes no sense? It's actually down right retarded.

&gt;Yet remember how all payments were blocked, how PayPal, Visa, Mastercard and others froze his accounts? You think they did it for fun, all by themselves?

I don't know, but that's Wikileaks you're talking about, not Assange. Don't confuse the two. It's also not relevant. If you could please stay on topic.

&gt;If that doesn't make you think that US government is behind the whole deal, then I don't know what will.

Maybe proof. Any proof. Like, just a piece of proof. Doesn't even have to he a complete proof. Irrelevant and baseless assertions just don't do it for me.

Don't confuse Assange's paranoid fantasies with reality. Just like there's no proof that the US is behind this, there's no proof that Assange would be extradited to the US.

In any case, I'm not qualified to make many useful points about diet. The level of misinformation on the internet and in 'common sense' is staggering, and many assumptions about what is healthy will turn out to be wrong.

I am arguing that consumers should be free to buy whatever they want at whatever price it is offered and be confident that it is safe to eat and that it is what it says on the tin. The blog entry argues that it is consumers' job as a whole to try and control the quality of meat by boycotting certain types of product. I think that this job should be performed by legislation and the FSA, not the public.

&gt;I'm very dubious of some of the research which has been output by corporate funded departments saying that industrially produced food with loads of toxins is just as good as food produced the way food has been through history.

Just because something is natural doesn't make it better. Human history has been riddled with massive famine and disease as a result of poor farming and food production processes. A quick skim of the systematic review I quoted suggests that it received no external funding and was based at Stanford. It also contains this quote:

&gt;Between 1997 and 2010, U.S. sales of organic foods increased from $3.6 to $26.7 billion (1 - 2). Although prices vary, consumers can pay up to twice as much for organic than conventional foods 

This raises some important issues - a $26.7bn industry (in one country alone) should be able to pay for some of its own 'dubious' studies to sway the evidence in its favour, but it appears that this has not been the case. Furthermore, would it not be favourable to the food industry to scare people into buying organic? It looks like their profit margins would be a lot higher as a result. It certainly worked for the bottled water companies.

&gt;I am arguing that consumers should be free to buy whatever they want at whatever price it is offered and be confident that it is safe to eat and that it is what it says on the tin. 

Of course, but this is just stating an ideal.

&gt;The blog entry argues that it is consumers' job as a whole to try and control the quality of meat by boycotting certain types of product. I think that this job should be performed by legislation and the FSA, not the public.

But it wasn't, and s/he and I are arguing it cannot be.

&gt;Just because something is natural doesn't make it better.

For sure, deadly nightshade, etc.

&gt;Human history has been riddled with massive famine and disease as a result of poor farming and food production processes.A quick skim of the systematic review I quoted suggests that it received no external funding and was based at Stanford. It also contains this quote:

&gt;&gt;Between 1997 and 2010, U.S. sales of organic foods increased from $3.6 to $26.7 billion (1 - 2). Although prices vary, consumers can pay up to twice as much for organic than conventional foods

&gt;This raises some important issues - a $26.7bn industry (in one country alone) should be able to pay for some of its own 'dubious' studies to sway the evidence in its favour, but it appears that this has not been the case. 

But still, most famine is caused by human agency - war, privation, etc.  Disease, couldn't say I'd guess most of it is natural, but there's plenty of human generated or exacerbated disease too.  Broadly speaking, I'm not going to defend the organic food industry, which is mostly an industrial capitalist industry like any other.

&gt;It looks like their profit margins would be a lot higher as a result. It certainly worked for the bottled water companies.

Well, precisely.  Plenty examples of green-washing, and ""ethical"" capitalism have been blown to shit with a bit of examination of what is being marketed.

&gt;Depending on how you measure the average wage here, it's about £20-25k. 

These are the mean and the median.  The latter is not a bad measure, but the former is grossly distorted by high salaries afforded to very few people - like bankers and chief executives.  The median is better, but the mode is the salary most people earn, and since the distribution isn't bimodal, it's not a terrible measure to use if you're interested in what many/most (albeit not the majority of) people have to exist on.

true,Airazz,uk,Coventry smells,"&gt;Yes, they did.

Please name a couple.

&gt;That is not proof, it's just empty assertions.

Not empty assertions, just clear claims from the courts. O'Dwyer never did anything that was a crime in UK. However, what he did is indeed illegal in US, which is why he was wanted there. They eventually settled to him paying £20,000 or something like that, which is a bit too much considering that he never committed any crimes.

&gt;But they can say ""He fucked your women, so we will kill him. give him to us.""? That makes no sense? It's actually down right retarded.

Sweden is more willing to cooperate with US than UK is, that's why US wants him to be extradited to Sweden. Rape accusations are just silly excuses.

&gt;I don't know, but that's Wikileaks you're talking about, not Assange. Don't confuse the two. It's also not relevant. If you could please stay on topic.

That's directly related and that's the whole issue here. That's why US tortured Bradley Manning, that's also why they want to capture, rape and kill Assange. They're both the top guys at Wikileaks.

Unless you have any other explanation as to why Assange might get a death penalty if extradited to US. 

&gt;In fact, I don't think I've even heard a believable scenario where he even could be extradited to the US. for what crime? 

Wikileaks. Releasing classified documents to the public. You know, treason of the Flag and all that. You may think ""Wait a second, he's not a US citizen..."" but that doesn't matter to US. If they want to punish you, they will. Think about Megaupload, it got royally raped and escaped on a technicality.

&gt;Has he even been in the US in the last decade or so?

No need for that, literally. You're probably not very good at this whole fancy ""reading"" thing, so I'll repeat: British student Richard O'Dwyer nearly got sent to US because what he did is a crime in US.

I think it can be - I think it is difficult to implement and I don't think it's being done perfectly right now - but I do think it's possible. 

On the other hand, I think that if people voluntarily pay more for meat, the market will respond by simply increasing the price of their low quality meat, and nothing will change. I think any move that encourages deregulation in favour of 'letting the market decide what it wants' will turn out to be a very bad idea. (See American healthcare, telecoms etc.)

One of the crucial issues is whether we need to do more to regulate the ethics of farming (e.g. the conditions that animals are kept in). Another issue worth considering is whether we need to investigate a baseline price for meat. This might help to ensure that farming remains economically viable and prevent further conglomeration of food producers into few, powerful entities. This is the sort of thing that needs to be the target of actual research.

The invasion was in October, there was little impact from it. 

What happened was that the Taliban were seeking international recognition as the ""legitimate"" power in Afghanistan. The UN had told them that eradicating the opium trade was a precursor to this. They then told their followers that it was ""un-Islamic"" to grow opium in order to use religion to push the agenda. [It had worked by Feb 2001](http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&amp;dat=20010216&amp;id=5vFRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ZXADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4713,4323481). 

&gt; And then after 2001 it's back to business again.

That was the Northern Alliance, our allies and [we knew in advance this would happen](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/nov/25/afghanistan.drugstrade). They were growing most of the opium, always had been. The little amount in 2001 [was grown entirely in their region](http://www.rawa.org/na-opium.htm). 

The UK media had to spun this full tilt to imply it was the Taliban, I was aware of this at the time and it was infuriating to watch them constantly lie to us. The reality is [quite different](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_transnational_anti-crime_and_anti-drug_activities#Corruption_and_the_erosion_of_the_rule_of_law), the American's are [directly aiding the trade to build alliances](http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Afghanistan/US_Forces_Narcotics_Trade.html) with the Northern Alliance Warlords like [Karzai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Wali_Karzai#CIA_connections). There are even [pictures of them guarding poppy fields](http://www.globalresearch.ca/are-american-troops-protecting-afghan-opium/5309922) for them. US propaganda radio stations were broadcasting messages like:

&gt;&gt;  [""Respected people of Helmand. The soldiers of ISAF and ANA do not destroy poppy fields,"" it said. ""They know that many people of Afghanistan have no choice but to grow poppy. ISAF and the ANA do not want to stop people from earning their livelihoods.""](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/apr/28/afghanistan.declanwalsh). 

Let's face it, the American's have a long and dirty history of using the narcotics trade to fund their causes. IMHO the case has been completely proven that this is happening in Afghanistan today.

true,Dossena,null,null,"Liverpool is the only team I support (well the U21s too) but as a fan of football there are a lot of teams I quite like and hope do well (unless playing us). 

From the EPL I've always had a soft spot for Man City just because of the ""the enemy of my enemy is a friend"" feeling in regards to United. I was incredibly happy during the last day of the season last year when Man City got the dramatic win to snatch the title from United's grasp at the last possible moment. 

I've been a fan of Swansea since they were promoted a couple of seasons ago. Just liked their style of play and like many of their players. 

From the lower leagues I always like to see Plymouth Argyle do well (doesn't happen often in recent years) because of family connections to the city. 

I live in Scotland but wouldn't say I have much of an interest in the SPL. I do have a slight liking towards Celtic because my mum supported them when she was younger plus they have the Dalglish link. 

From Spain I like Barcelona just because I admire how they play and so many of their players. Same with Dortmund in the Bundesliga. 

Then there are teams I like because of a player. Like CSKA Moscow for Honda and Napoli for Cavani (and previously Dossena). 


Teams I dislike include; EPL: Man United (obviously) and Chelsea. Stoke City because I don't like their style of football. QPR (because of 'Arry), Spurs and Aston Villa. 

And I know I'm supposed to not like Everton but in reality I don't actually mind them too much. Obviously I hate it when they're doing better than us and will always want to beat them. Maybe it's because I haven't grown up in Liverpool so haven't experienced the proper rivalry between us. 

I also dislike Real Madrid (but still love Xabi). And I'm not much of a fan of Rangers. Mainly because the majority of Rangers fans I've met or know are pricks. ",0,1361127295,null,0,false,0,c8gri8q,t3_18ni8a,t1_c8gri8q,t3_18ni8a,null,1431320976,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

The Police and Criminal evidence act sets out, in section 24 what constables may arrest for. 

http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/section/24

An arrest must be justified by by meeting certain points and the person in question must be suspected of committing an offence, having committed an offence or be in the process of committing an offence.  

This particular section of PACE was later made defunct by section 110 of the serious organised crime and police act in 2006. It basically confirms what PACE says. 


(a)to enable the name of the person in question to be ascertained (in the case where the constable does not know, and cannot readily ascertain, the person's name, or has reasonable grounds for doubting whether a name given by the person as his name is his real name);
(b)correspondingly as regards the person's address;
(c)to prevent the person in question—
(i)causing physical injury to himself or any other person;
(ii)suffering physical injury;
(iii)causing loss of or damage to property;
(iv)committing an offence against public decency (subject to subsection (6)); or
(v)causing an unlawful obstruction of the highway;

These points are completely redundant if a person is has committed no offence. We are not simply allowed to arrest because we deem that a person needs medical treatment.

Facilitating illegal downloading of copyrighted material. I'm only going to mention the one they broke, since I have no interest to cooperate in your goalpost moving enterprise.

&gt;Not empty assertions, just clear claims from the courts. O'Dwyer never did anything that was a crime in UK. However, what he did is indeed illegal in US, which is why he was wanted there. They eventually settled to him paying £20,000 or something like that, which is a bit too much considering that he never committed any crimes.

That's not what the assertion was about. The assertion is that the US ""can do what they want to do"". The O'Dwyer case could perhaps be used as circumstantial evidence that the UK isn't the best place to be. It's hardly conclusive though. Either way, Assange could be out of  the UK tomorrow if he wanted. Well, he could before he broke bail, now I don't know.

&gt;Sweden is more willing to cooperate with US than UK is, that's why US wants him to be extradited to Sweden. Rape accusations are just silly excuses.

And that's just more baseless assertions. Hell, you just provided evidence that the UK is just as, or more so, eager to please the US. I will repeat myself just for you: there is no proof that the US is involved in this affair. None. That's why you have to resort to what-ifs and ""duh-it's-obivouses"".

&gt;That's directly related and that's the whole issue here.

Then show how.

&gt;That's why US tortured Bradley Manning,

Irrelevant. There's a major difference between Manning and Assange. The US actually charged Manning. Then there's all the other things, like Manning being in the army et al, but that's superfluous.
 
&gt;that's also why they want to capture, rape and kill Assange.

How do you know that? All you know is that a few individual think that. In fact, that last bit was so exaggerated that I'm thinking you're having a laugh now. 

&gt;They're both the top guys at Wikileaks.

Who? Assange and Manning? Manning was not involved in the management of wikileaks at all.

&gt;Unless you have any other explanation as to why Assange might get a death penalty if extradited to US. 

No one knows why he would get that since the US hasn't charged him. They haven't even hinted that they want him, only that they were investigating if they could charge him for anything. Years later, they still haven't. So, there's no indication that he is wanted by the US, and there's definitely no indication that he would receive the death penalty. The latter is quite honestly just absurd. I bet you can't find a similar case the last hundred years where the accused was murdered.

&gt;Wikileaks.

""Wikileaks"" is not a scenario.

&gt;Releasing classified documents to the public.

Not a crime for Assange.

&gt;You know, treason of the Flag and all that.

Not a crime for Assange.

&gt;You may think ""Wait a second, he's not a US citizen..."" but that doesn't matter to US.

False.

&gt;No need for that, literally.

Technically no, it isn't.  If he committed a crime more than a decade ago it could in some cases still be investigated.

&gt;You're probably not very good at this whole fancy ""reading"" thing, so I'll repeat: British student Richard O'Dwyer nearly got sent to US because what he did is a crime in US.

You're in no position to be condescending, seeing as how all you have to back you up are fantasies and earlier mentioned what-ifs. He was not extradited, and that was the UK. See how that's not the same thing as being extradited from Sweden? Maybe you're smug remark about literacy was just common projecting.

The difference seems to be that when I took part in it, you could do a placement in any type of job you were interested in, it didn't have to be a shop. A friend of mine wanted to work in engineering, got a placement with a company and at the end of it he was hired to wire plane parts for the RAF.

true,logopolys,hartnell,Hartnell,"Frankly, none of the new Who Sontarans have lived up to my standard of what the stories should have been.  *The Time Warrior* was a fantastic story which (combined with *The Sontaran Experiment*) demonstrated that the alien worked well not as an invasion concept (despite their backstory) but as a single-man threat.  New Who screwed this up from the beginning, as their entire plot (their stratagem, if you will) relied on a genius human youth and a complete lack of military presence, both aspects counter-intuitive to the point of Sontarans.  (This is quite apart from other assessments of that story; it was a fine story, but not a good Sontaran story.)

Sontarans have fallen into the new Who tropes of aliens.  Aliens are either big invasion (which is over far too quick to be called a proper invasion), creepy-creepy (think *Fear Her*, *Night Terrors*, *The Idiot's Lantern*, etc.), not evil but it takes the whole episode to be properly understood, or one-offs who hang out with the Doctor sometimes.  This last is largely Moffat-Who, starting back in *A Good Man Goes to War*, but also covering your man Strax.

Frankly, I miss the loner aliens, the single-man threats that were more effective stories because they had so much focus.  *Dalek* is virtually the only new Who story to do this right.  (By no small coincidence, *Dalek* is also the best new Who Dalek story.)

And, Chelsea have managed him very well by sending him on a loan to Atletico where he is in the starting eleven of a team challenging for the title, and will get to play CL next year. 

All in all, there seems to be a very well timed succession plan in place, which is a good thing.

and he left without saying it back. he was in love with her too. he loved her so very much and had to leave her in another dimension and thought he would never see her again. when she mentions the baby he thinks she's pregnant with Mickeys baby, you can SEE the pain in his face, but when Rose tells him its not her you can really see the relief. this scene was just extremely perfect and just thinking about it gives me a horrid case of feels.

The doctor tells her that he's burning up a sun just to say goodbye. she asks why he can't get through, and he tells her that 2 universes would be destroyed. she responds with ""So?"" AHHHHHH she loves him so much that she would destroy 2 universes just to be with him.

Rose was definitely my favorite companion. I hated the fact that she was with Mickey from the start, and i was glad when he got left in the parallel universe because now things would be easier between Rose and the Doctor. i liked Martha, Donna and the Ponds, but lord i just loved Rose like no other.

Now that you actually show me a picture black and white is more accurate. I think at primary school we called them wolf spiders. I have no idea why this may be, nor if that is even actually a type of spider. 

As you seem to be a spider expert, or at least more expert than me, d'you know anything about the homing instinct/territorial activities of the big hairy ones that are about 2"" across? 

I did an experiment a few years back where I put a daub of tippex on the back of a huge one that had set up home in my bedroom and released it outside my window (Ground floor room, window only a few inches from the floor) and he made his way back to his corner. Over about a week or two I released him at progressively further and further points down the road in a hedge,and he managed to get back from about 40' away, then never made it back. He was called Billy. 

Obviously the results are hardly reliable, as this is one spider, non repeated and the white dot on his back may have made him more vulnerable to spider eating creatures, but does this sound like a typical range?

 I think what we've got right now is working, it's just not traditional. Another point from the postmatch thread was how nicely Ba was able to field long balls and how he was involved with almost every goal. Strikers are meant to score and they should, but given our squad and formation I think it's excusable if our strikers score less than the average striker. 

When you've got Fruandentor Mazacarsespard all in the starting XI with the eye for goal, your lone striker will likely score less goals and that's okay with me...

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;As any new job seekers knows, real experience counts over a college certificate

No it doesn't. There is no hard and fast, no black and white. I left university prematurely thinking this, worked for free all over the place in all manner of roles, some of them at very prestigious places, and then found that most employers want a qualification, and the others see you as overqualified for the minimum wage roles. You go the other route and get the qualification and it's not enough unless you also have experience - which is why most uni courses now have you go off to work for your third year. 

People aren't doing nothing if they're collecting JSA. It's actually quite a drawn-out process, as each job needs a new cover letter written, a different C.V. showcasing or focusing on relevant skills, endless amendments and edits, and that's just if you're able to find anything to apply to. Then you have only two in fifty applications even _viewed_, and none responded to, and then you have interviews with places that turn out to be scams or carefully-worded door knocking or pyramid schemes preying on the desperate with no assurance of pay that would cost you £12+ a day you don't have on transport just to not get any basic wage. That's all before anything like volunteer work. I'm willing to bet that anyone earnestly looking for work is doing as much actual productive stuff than most office workers.

And even if it is a well-intentioned way to give people work experience, nobody but supermarket HR departments are going to look favourably on a month or two of shelf-stacking. It's not exactly the sort of thing that's going to turn the tide and switch up your fortunes overnight. There's also the problem that you can end up far worse off as a consequence, even if it's paid work. I landed a seasonal role doing just this, and it not only cost me as much money to work there as I earned, it impacted my claim for the following two months so I at one point got less than a tenner in a fortnight.

You'll be lucky to get one player out of every youth team making your first team squad unfortunately. We do have the likes of Livermore and Caulker, both of whom have had England involvement, so we've not done that badly recently.

Also, the better (and richer) you get, the less likely you are to risk playing a youngster. Ajax do turn out great players, but their league situation allows them to bring youngsters through under less pressure than we do here. There are no shit teams in the PL, and to use the cliché, no easy games, so you have to loan your players out, and hope that they're nurtured well and are given games in the lower divisions.

Personally, I'm hopeful about the current crop of youngsters we've got, the performances in the NextGen last year and the U21 league this year have been promising. Coulibaly is talked about as having a lot of promise, we'll see how his loan deal goes, and Pritchard, too. He could feasibly make his debut in the next year.

Oh of course, even though she may think otherwise sometimes.

I can honestly say though that in the 20+ years I've been watching football I've never come across anyone actively supporting 4-5 clubs. Liking clubs, fair enough, supporting no.

I understand that the rules of economics are that you charge what the market is prepared to pay, however if every landlord gets this sudden new tax burden then every landlord will increase their rent at once, and no tenant will have any option but be forced to pay more. If it was a few landlords then they would have to take it on the chin, but it isn't, it's every landlord in the whole country so it will be burdened onto the tenants.

To put it shortly, what the overall market will bear will slightly increase.

Also many landlords set up companies to own the properties and do the rental from and so they would be able to avoid this tax very easily, since you wouldn't be able to impose a second property tax on a company. It takes 10 mins and £15 to set up a basic Company with Companies House. You could even have a separate company for each property. Too easy if you know how.

He didn't just 'inherit' the horrific economic situation, which many of his supporters claim. He went a large way to creating it, via deregulating too far and actually **increasing** borrowing during good times rather than paying down the countries debt load.

He was totally out of his depth as Prime Minister, being unable to hold together a coherent cabinet or command his ministers and was absolutely bereft of new ideas after 10 years of New Labour. About the only genuinely new idea he had was creating a 'British Day' which went nowhere. He also singularly failed to connect with the British voters, now you don't need to be a charismatic PR man like Cameron or Blair to do this, you just need to come across as approachable, understanding and intellectual, Brown only managed the last of these.

He was very much a failure as a PM, totally out of his depth. The only really good thing he did was prevent economic catastrophe by his speedy recapitalisation of the banks, providing an example to the rest of the world and later leading the global effort against the credit crunch. Because of this I have a feeling that he might be treated more favourably 20-30 years down the line in History books but we still have to remember who wholeheartedly supported the economic policies that caused the crash, who stupidly claimed to have 'put an end to boom and bust' (one of the most **hubristic** things a politician has ever said) and who actually increased Britain's debt and budget deficit during economic boom times not seen since the post war years!",0,1361139402,null,0,1361140224,0,c8guuzz,t3_18or39,t1_c8guuzz,t1_c8gmvsv,null,1435583046,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,hennell,cnty-uk,Bristol,"I don't think that would happen, as it wouldn't be a sustainable system. If no-one works then no-one earns, so who's using the trains that drive themselves? The economy has to support itself, allowing people to work at a rate that gives them enough funds to buy the products others make. On a global scale now you have areas of poorer countries(/low cost labour markers) make products that the employes could never afford. However they can sell them to a richer market; a market that dies if we all become unemployed.

Before jobs became 'rare' the economics of such a situation would start to level things out. At a certain point I think the minimum wage level would collapse, as that would give the potential for people to work at a cheaper rate then the machine, and (given the substantial labour savings) products would become cheaper, theoretically allowing wages and prices to merge to a lower, but sustainable level. Of course with less pay, the need for the more luxury products starts to dwindle, so they'd loose their profits until the machine's became too expensive for the quantities needed... which could end up in a massive death of business, or a return to manual labour; hard to guess generically.


Of course while I'm not sure all jobs become rare, some things are definitely moving that way. Take self driving cars. Once they get good they're going to be a massive problem. Not for me mine you; I can't drive, getting a auto-car will be fantastic. But how long before the trucking industry replaces drivers with machines? They can drive non-stop, no sleep, toliet or meal breaks; no risk of crashing (Or at least less then a tired/overworked driver), and have no pensions, health or other costs that human drivers will take up. Sure they'll need repair, technicians etc but as soon as the total cost becomes less using a machine, why wouldn't they head that way? Makes sense; of course now you've got loads of jobs disappearing, where the main qualification was  'anyone who can drive' (Bit more then that I know, but that's the basic entry requirement).

Will this happen? I have absolutely no idea.

**Edit:** I do think, however, that it is in our interest to automate and increase efficiency as much as possible. To use one of your examples: trains. I think we should be converting to driverless trains as quickly as possible to increase reliability and reduce cost. While some people may be made redundant in the short term, I don't think it's sensible to subscribe to that kind of Luddism. After all, nobody claims that the job market is now suffering because we don't employ coachmen or hand-loom weavers. When one job becomes unnecessary, it just frees up resources to do something else useful. 

I hope the same thing happens to cars too. If you think about the number of hours of people's lives that could be freed by eliminating the need to drive it is truly enormous. It would also eliminate accidents, decrease journey times and reduce energy usage. I can't see why there isn't a huge push towards it (well, except from Google). As long as people want to drive recreationally, they will have the chance to do that. Driverless cars will simply be there to eliminate sitting through hour-long tailbacks on the M25.

I don't think putting either of them in would change more than 5-8 goals than we currently have.

We have too many small-centralised players who are great with the ball and great at creating chances. However, they're not great at pulling defenders out of position.

Without Moses, we have no width to pull players out of line and we constantly rely on trickery to get us through by MASAZCAR. The smart teams know this and just sit back, wait for the error and hit us on the counter

I was puzzled by this statement as it doesn't ring true.  Looking at the CAB website and specifically [this](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CDQQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adviceguide.org.uk%2Findex%2Fh_renting_from_a_letting_agency.pdf&amp;ei=hGEhUbifG82QhQenr4HwAw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEL6SaV1h6-PCDaQ_vR3OPg9gDZyQ&amp;sig2=WHR2Q9VFK2VKu5jfG2UFxQ&amp;bvm=bv.42553238,d.ZG4&amp;cad=rja). It looks like 'administration fees' are perfectly fine.  

&gt;What a letting agency can charge for 

&gt;**A letting agency can charge you:** 
 
&gt;**an unlimited fee once you have signed a contract to accept a tenancy**
 
&gt;You must have agreed to take the tenancy before the agency can charge you. 
 
&gt; **Administration fees**
 
&gt;Many agencies will charge you an administration fee. This fee may cover things like the cost of preparing the tenancy agreement, checking references,  making up the inventory and any other costs of setting up the tenancy. Many  agencies will  charge you for renewing your tenancy agreement once it expires. *

&gt;The connection between more and better has been broken; our needs for many products and services are already more than adequately met, and many of our as-yet-unsatisfied needs will be met not by producing more, but by producing differently, producing other things, or even producing less. This is especially true as regards our needs for air, water, space, silence, beauty, time and human contact...

&gt;From the point where it takes only 1,000 hours per year or 20,000 to 30,000 hours per lifetime to create an amount of wealth equal to or greater than the amount we create at the present time in 1,600 hours per year or 40,000 to 50,000 hours in a working life, we must all be able to obtain a real income equal to or higher than our current salaries in exchange for a greatly reduced quantity of work...

&gt;  Neither is it true any longer that the more each individual works, the better off everyone will be. The present crisis has stimulated technological change of an unprecedented scale and speed: 'the micro-chip revolution'. The object and indeed the effect of this revolution has been to make rapidly increasing savings in labour, in the industrial, administrative and service sectors. Increasing production is secured in these sectors by decreasing amounts of labour. As a result, the social process of production no longer needs everyone to work in it on a full-time basis. The work ethic ceases to be viable in such a situation and work-based society is thrown into crisis...

He's not contradicting himself at all, they're different circumstances. Coutinho was injured for a month or two, while Sturridge had a minor strain that caused him to miss one game, most likely as a precaution. Sturridge has also been at full fitness for 3-4 weeks now, while Coutinho has only been here for 2 weeks. That's hardly enough time for the training staff to get him where they want him to be fitness wise, so it's only logical for them to bring him along slowly. No need to throw the kid straight into the fire, especially when he's been struggling for confidence and fitness. Bleed him into the first and build his confidence up.

true,scoutisimba,cnty-uk,Cambridge,"Robots will do jobs we have been doing and to a much better standard than we ever could. They will do jobs we can’t do at all and the ones we have yet to imagine. That in my view is inevitable, and I do believe it will lead to a lower percentage of the population being employed overall, especially over the next 50 years (even if high-tech jobs are created). I say that not only because traditionally labour intensive jobs seem highly likely to move into automation when it becomes economically advantageous and technologically possible to do so, but also because of some of the [thoughts this economist has.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/william-lazonick/robots-dont-destroy-jobs-_b_2396465.html) 

However I don't think we'll see a true paradigm shift in how societies function until we have very cheap energy in addition to automation. Or entire system of consumerism may well depend on the majority having jobs so that people can actually buy all this junk we produce, but perhaps we'll be less bothered about profits and more concerned with welfare if we ever get an army of robot slaves running around on pseudo-free energy doing for us anyway. If not we'll just have to come up with stuff humans can do that robots can't. 

&gt;Trains are starting to be able to drive themselves.

Well, we've already had that technology for some time really. In fact given all the recent advancements with image recognition we can even react dynamically to hazards. I think nowadays the friction against such things is trending away from technological limitations and moving towards human behaviour. Who wants to get on a plane with no pilot?

&gt;UK and Sweden don't have death penalty, so according to all the international treaties and shit, they can't extradite/deport people if there's a possibility of them being killed/tortured at the country that's requesting the extradition. 

That fact that the UK and Sweden doesn't have the death penalty is not the reason that they can't extradite if capital punishment is on the table, but it's true that they can't. The same is of course true for crimes of a political or military nature, or if torture is a possibility.

Your experiment sounds really interesting! I'm not aware of any evidence that spiders actually have a homing instinct - although they may well respond similarly when put in the same situation, and follow the same stimuli to reach the same destination. 

I don't suppose the spider liked the Tippex but scientists do worse to invertebrates all the time, so I wouldn't worry too much about that. The big spiders are *Tegenaria duellica*. The ones in the webs are normally females, for what that's worth, so maybe it was Billy-Jean you had there. They don't actually wander much (although the males definitely do) as they tend to build their web and stay in it.

The Paper:

Muslim Unemployment and Ethnic Minority benefit costs aren't part of the same sentence, are two seperate statements.  **Not all ethnic minorities are muslim**.

So, if you read the figures accurately, in the context of total spending, you realise that the percentage spent on Muslim employment **MUST** be under 2% of all benefit spending, and considering there's a whole 92% *not* spent on ethnic minorities.

Also, remember that reasons for muslim unemployment may also include the fact we're in a huge economic crisis and also that there's a trend towards anti muslim sentiment which isn't helped by people like you spreading misleading information around.

But is it equally reasonable to not show it to the British court**s**? I think it's borderline idiocy to keep such evidence secret. That's why I'm thinking he doesn't have anything. He is not a stupid man.

Now I feel slightly bad that I didn't feel bad.

I only did the experiment because I had moved Billy-Jean out of my bedroom, gently and in a polite fashion, but next night there was another big spider in exactly the same spot. I wondered if it was the same one, or if it was just another one stealing the territory, hence the tippex and the experiment. When she returned the next night from just outside the window I wondered how far she could make it from, and put her a few feet further a day until she never made it back... 

I think this does call for a repeat of the experiment, perhaps with actual controls and repeatability and so on! I'm pretty sure you can get tippex still, but maybe a UV marker pen would be kinder, unless that would attract UV seeing predators... 

On an additional note, it *was* a wolf spider I was thinking of. We used to hunt them in the field at school, they were ridiculously fast as you say, but you could corner them if you were cunning, and that's when they jumped (or more likely scurried fast at young me making *me* jump* ...)

I haven't watched this for a while, but IIRC this references even earlier predictions being made since the industrial revolution. And of course Star Trek made the abolition-of-money prediction in the 60s.

The Mighty Micro also makes a point about the big social changes that would be necessary to allow this. In simple terms, everyone would be living on the equivalent of benefits, so the stigma for that would have to end. And while the employed could still gain some financial and other rewards, there would have to be some way to prevent them (and the rich-enough-to-invest classes) from hoarding all the wealth.

Actually, if hardly anyone is earning money, the current business model probably couldn't be sustained - who exactly would businesses sell to?

And there's political problems as well - how do you convince those with wealth and power to give up the system that made them wealthy and powerful?

A complete elimination of employment is unlikely, as well - at least in the shorter long term, there will still be a need for artists and extroverts to create entertainment products. Scary thought, though - maybe in the distant future, AI will be at least capable of developing all our art and entertainment too.

Extremely long term, I imagine we're looking much more at Ian M. Banks and the Culture rather than Star Treks no money model. Star Trek seems pretty inconsistent, even self-contradictory at times - not so much TOS or TNG (which have the on-a-starship thing to avoid most of the issues), but you see some problems in DS9. Take for example Siskos father, who runs a restaurant - is that a for-money business or not?

true,Airazz,uk,Coventry smells,"&gt;In the real world, you don't automatically get something because you want it.

I don't think it's fair to assume that real-world laws apply to US. 

Again, they fucked over TPB in Sweden (what TPB was doing was NOT illegal in sweden), they fucked over O'Dwyer (what he was doing was NOT illegal in UK) and they fucked over Kim Dotcom in NZ, but had to let him go because ""He takes our movies 'n shit"" isn't a valid accusation. Yet they still managed to go there and to fuck everyone's life up.

So the chief investigator of the first TPB raid was offered a job by Warner Bros. if he did a good job fucking the servers up. Guess [where he works now](http://torrentfreak.com/chief-investigator-pirate-bay-employed-by-plaintiff-080418/). 

Also, as a bonus for you, [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pirate_Bay_trial#Plaintiffs) is the official list of plaintiffs in the case. Don't say that Americans aren't involved in it.

You may say that the *government* isn't involved, but it is. Remember the Megaupload case? That was pretty much the same thing, yet CIA were roaming all around the planet without issues, fucking shit up. 

Same thing with all those SOPA's and CISPA's, their main targets are sites like TPB and Wikileaks. Those new legislations are not being passed for fun or for the sake of artists, they're being passed by the billion dollar record labels who lobby the government.

&gt;So they failed [on Kim Dotcom] too.

Just because of a technicality. Don't ignore the fact that the american officers came there, raided his house, arrested his stuff, took his computers, copied his hard drives and sent all the data back to US for decryption. 

&gt;Yet they haven't done anything [about Wikileaks] in years.

Yea, except sending CIA and FBI agents to various countries that are related to the case. I don't think that's nothing.

You'll have to rephrase that, English is not my first language.

&gt;You were talking about how the American government is omnipotent and can do whatever it wants internationally (while still having to spend two years making up an excuse, apparently). 

Assange's extradition to Sweden is one big move, you can't ignore that. There is no good reason why Sweden would need to get him just for questioning. There is a Swedish embassy in UK, they can do the questioning there. It's not such a big thing. The only logical explanation is that he might be extradited to US from Sweden.

&gt;Now you're talking about big business controlling the American government. Am I supposed to assume that it's really EMI that's after Assange?

Nah, EMI is after the Pirate Bay, with the government supporting them. Assange is being chased just by the government. 

&gt; By something I clearly meant filing a charge or maybe even making an extradition request.

I like how you just brush away every bit of proof because it doesn't support your side of the story.

An investigation is still ongoing, it didn't stop and it was not cancelled. The extradition request was not made because it would expose US and their desire to rip Assange apart.

The trick is that US is still very into the Wikileaks thing and Assange was Wikileaks' spokesperson and the front man. It's quite obvious that they would like to have a private chat with him in Guantanamo or some other summer resort.

&gt;Bittorrent is just a technology, and the torrent files don't contain the cables, just hashes.

&gt;Oh so now it's sensational journalism from right wing conspirators lol

The Telegraph is openly Tory.  The Tory party is right wing.  I don't know how else to spell it out to you.  I also pointed out that the figures the telegraph gave you were also misleading, because when looked at in the context of overall spending the 8.6 billion spent on ethnic minorities was a tiny fraction of the overall spending of 160 billion.  And that ethnic minorities encompasses quite a large and varied portion of our demographic, Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities a smaller fraction still, so we're looking at less than 2% of the benefit budget going to unemployed muslims.  And if you hadn't noticed by the new statesman article you yourself black people are suffering a similar unemployment problem, which is more likely due to the recession.

Can you see how this doesn't fit the narrative you're trying to present here?  It's dishonest and it's not helping.

Most people's jobs are not crucial to meeting the basic human needs of food and shelter.  If people were happy to sit at home and do nothing but eat all day, then most of the workforce could be unemployed. 
 
However humans have other needs.  The need for fun, romantic love, emotional fulfillment, relaxation, socialising and exploration.  And most of all purpose.  The other industries we have in this country, fulfill these needs.  The bar and restaurant industry provides us with fun and socialising.  TV, cinema and music provide us with fun and emotional fulfillment.  The travel industry lets us explore other countries.  The spa and hotel industry helps us relax.  And all these industries provide many, many jobs which provide a sense of purpose.  

So no, jobs will never become rare because it's human nature to want to do something and having met one challenge to want to meet another.

I think it's a valid point to bring up though, because we have struggled with opponents that collectively, as a team, press us high up the pitch. There's a big difference in quality between the team started today compared to their usual starting lineup, a lineup that had the best away defense in the PL.

true,stop___grammar_time,silver,Silver,"Well think about it objectively. Do you really expect an entire town to believe some wild story by a little girl? Remember, the Doctor was only there for a little while, probably no more than an hour or two at the most and little Amelia was the only witness. The only real evidence that he was there was a knocked down garden shed, something easily enough given a mundane explanation in a small town like Leadworth. 

Amelia wasn't the most believable witness either. She had no parents, and it sounded like she had only relatively recently moved into town and didn't like it. Her wild stories could be easily attributed to her acting out and having a wild imagination.

I mean which sounds like a more likely scenario to a normal Leadworth resident:

""A big blue box fell out of the sky and crashed into the garden shed. A man in raggedy clothes climbed out and introduced himself as a doctor, told a bunch of fantastic stories to a little girl, ate half the food in the fridge, then climbed back into the box and disappeared without a trace. The only witness was some little girl who recently moved into town.""

Or,

""A raggedly dressed vagrant knocked down the Ponds' garden shed for god knows whatever reason, probably looking for stuff to steal. The Ponds' little girl came out to see what the commotion was, and the vagrant smooth-talked her with fantastic stories into letting him into their house and letting him eat their food. He then left, talking the girl out of calling the police by promising he'd come back for her. She's lucky he wasn't murdered, there's all sorts of crazy homeless folk wandering around these days.""

Everyone going on about how Bale is banging in free kicks now, but it's just a recent thing he could even make a goalkeeper to make a save from free kicks, let alone score them. Hoddle used to score free kicks for fun.

Despite how apparently terrible we are, Suarez has performed to a level where even his haters see that he is comparable to RVP (to think Suarez scored most his goals being supported by an at the time 18 year old Suso and 17 year old Sterling, amazing). 

Today's result was good, the performance was great to see after a tough week, and yet I felt unusually flat about it.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"&gt;how his whole life kinda revolved around being the doctor for his whole life.

I'm confused by this circular reasoning.

Anywho, the seventh Doctor is my favorite. I told myself when I started watching classic many months ago that I wouldn't pick a favorite. I wanted to love all the Doctors. And I do. But the seventh has stolen my heart.

He's got a dry humor with a dark Time Lord power underneath, and of course, a kickass companion: Ace. Their relationship is so unique, it's a tag-team ""you do the talking, I do the walking"" with 7 as a sort of stand-in parent/guide and tutor. Yet at the same time, it's almost, if you want to put on the goggles, romantic. But because of the tutor/guide thing and 7's distant otherness, it's very platonic.

And by dark Time Lord power I mean that during the seventh Doctor's era you got the feeling that while the seventh seems like a goofy dusty professor on the outside, sometimes you can tell there's an undercurrent of something. This something is alien, it's terrifying, and it's dangerous.

But it's different from the godlike awe I get from the tenth Doctor. This is where it gets hard to explain. The tenth Doctor's godlike-ness, in my opinion, relates to his vanity. Both are very unique to the tenth Doctor (unlike the shallow narcissism of the sixth or fourth).

But the tenth Doctor makes you think that he is some kind of tragic and lonely god high above us who lives in another plane. The seventh Doctor feels more like a pervasive sense of otherness. Dark otherness. (That and it's been pointed out to me that while Tennant is a fantastic actor, he can't do ""eccentric"" to save his life despite being a master at barely-concealed-anger. McCoy has the opposite acting strength/weakness.)

Btw, this dark sense of otherness is very strong in the novel Lungbarrow. Funnily enough, he is revealed to be the Other in the novel and his cousins in the House of Prydon often wonder what the Doctor is. He's Time's Champion for one thing...
What's interesting is that I say these things about the seventh Doctor but I don't know how I reached this feeling. Probably because of the story Remembrance of the Daleks. It was my first seventh Doctor story. I think. I don't know why, but there's something compelling about his personality. It's a blend of dignity and humility, comedy and darkness.

In retrospect he's also an amazing Doctor (and I'm more sure he's my favorite now) because of his excellent run on Big Finish Productions' audio drama range. McCoy's stories have made me cry. Yup. And break my heart. And just recently I listened to what is, imo, the best radio drama* I've heard yet out of 200+ and it's with SEVEN.

*Despite the term ""radio drama"" it's primarily just for purchased on www.bigfinish.com (though it has been on radio). They use the original actors for Doctors and companions, have full cast with full sound. It's not people sitting and narrating. It's like tv but for your ears.

true,matcht,lfc12,,"A new centre back is absolutely necessary, and I must say I am a huge fan of Chico. At the beginning of the season I thought he was an overly-aggressive, rash defender but now that he has settled he looks like one of the most composed centre backs in the league. He is very athletic, has a great leap, timing in challenges and comfortable in possession. He is also approaching his peak age. Swansea have been very solid this season (before today they had conceded the least away goals in the league). [Whoscored](http://www.whoscored.com/Regions/252/Tournaments/2/Seasons/3389/Stages/6531/Show/England-Premier-League-2012-2013) have him in their team of the season. Granted this is his first season and the pressure of playing for Liverpool is very different to Swansea but I think we should look at him.

Even though Martin Kelly coming back would help greatly to our fullback issues, and as cover in CB, I still think Johnson playing left back isn't something we should regularly resort to. We have much better balance with a left footed left back. 

A physical midfielder is key for us, especially for closing out games. We also look weak from defending set pieces, someone like Wanyama would help with that (although I don't necessarily think we should sign him - asking price is far too high). 

Despite having a seemingly overcrowded midfield, I think we should sign a young midfielder who can eventually carry the burden Gerrard currently does, in being the key midfielder to instigate attacks and control the game. Henderson could well become this but I feel he lacks the authority to play such an important role. Someone like Benat would be perfect, he is an extremely talented Spanish midfielder who is out of contract in 2014. Very good distribution from deep, great at pressing and a set piece specialist. With the amount of games Gerrard has had to play this season, we may need someone like him next season. Although I am saying this with little regard for Joe Allen, he may still regain form, and since it seems as if I am asking for far too many signings.

Obviously we continually create chances and seem to miss far too many but our attack seems strong at this moment, in particular Sturridge. But considering we did struggle without him against West Brom I can see why fans think we need another striker. Borini may come good but it is difficult to determine.

I would suggest that you try to actually watch some games first before trying to pick a team. No point in picking a team solely because of a video game. I almost always use Wiziwig.tv as a source for my online streaming. Most of the match threads here at /r/chelseafc and /r/soccer have streams also. If you have Fox Soccer, they show EPL games on the weekends. 

By saying that you have no other way to connect to a team in Europe is pretty vague. I'm sure you can find more connections than just FIFA. You also don't have to just search for a team in the EPL. Try to watch games in some of the other European leagues. The big four are the German, English, Spanish, and Italian leagues. 

However, if you still end up a Chelsea fan, we'd gladly accept you into our community. If you want to know more about the team, I'd suggest you watch the games and then participate in our match threads, and our pre-/post- match threads also. It's sort of hard how to answer your extremely broad question. If you have more specific questions, I'd be glad to answer, and I'm sure everyone on this subreddit would be glad to answer. http://www.weaintgotnohistory.com/ is a wonderful site for news, and it is also a site that gets posted on this subreddit quite a bit. 

I just want to make sure you don't jump into something without seeing all the aspects of it first.

EDIT: 
I guess I can answer your question about the league system since it's pretty straightforward and short. 

As far as the league system goes, it is extremely simple. There are multiple leagues in a nation, completely dependent on the nation. Then there is a promotion/relegation between leagues. For the EPL, the lowest three teams in score by the end of the season will get relegated to the 2nd tier league (the Championship). However, the top three teams from the 2nd tier league will go up to the 1st tier league as replacement.

The thing is, a lot of things within society are fundamentally scarce. Something like food or clothes can be made to a certain extent to the amounts which are required, but in Britain, the land and the housing stock in particular are fundamentally limited. We could all be twice as wealthy, and we would just spend twice as much trying to outbid each other for the decent housing. 

Although I'm strongly capitalist, it might well be, in the very long term, we end up looking back towards Marx's ideas. If enough of our requirements are post-scarcity, we might need some ideas like that to come to joint agreement on resolving the scarce loose-ends.

If you are in the bottom three when the season ends, you get relegated to a lower division and the top three from that division move up. 

In a season you play games in the league, the FA cup, the Capitol One cup a.k.a. the League cup and if you qualify for it, the Champions League or its younger brother the Europa League. If you get in the top four in the league, you play Champions League football with all the top clubs in Europe. If you get 4-6 (I believe) you play Europa League, the teams are still top class but not nearly close to Champions League. The FA cup and the League cup are domestic cups and every team from all divisions can play. After that it works like a normal cup, you get qualifiers, rounds of 8 and so on. This year the final is between a fourth division team and a first division team. 

Chelsea's golden era started in 2003 when Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich bought the club. We have since then won the league three times, the FA cup four times, the League cup twice and the Champions League last year, the pinnacle of European football. 

The players in the team are world class but it's a newly put together team and it's pretty young so hopefully we can get our shit sorted out for next season. This season we started off great but it all went to shit and culminated in us losing our beloved manager, club legend Roberto Di Matteo (when I say losing I don't mean he died, he just got sacked) and replacing him with probably the most hated man in Stamford Bridge, Rafael Benitez. We are currently sitting in third place in the league and we didn't make it past the qualifiers of the Champions League despite winning it last year so we are playing Europa League this year.

Search around but if you do end up wanting to really follow Chelsea here is a quick and dirty (not in-depth) summary of things you should know.

Chelsea Football Club were founded in 1905. Our stadium is called Stamford Bridge (or just ""the bridge"" for short) and it's located in SW London (in Fulham if you want to be precise). Chelsea has always been a fairly successful club but hit pretty hard times in the 70's. Things got better in the 80's and 90's and by the late 90's Chelsea was a consistent performer in the first division (I'll explain what that means below). The most dramatic change of recent history though came when our current owner, Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, bought the club in 2003 and pumped in gobs of cash to stabilize the financial situation of the club. That turned the club from a strong, consistent first division side into a club of title winning caliber. The team has been one of the dominant teams in England (and Europe for that matter) ever since. If you want to read in depth about the club's history wikipedia has a pretty good summary: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Chelsea_F.C.

The way the football league system works in England is pretty similar to most other European countries. The league is divided up into multiple ""tiers"". The first division (known as the Premiere League) has 20 teams in. They play 38 matches a season (2 against each team, home and away). Teams get 3 points for a win, 1 for a draw and 0 for a loss. At the end of the season the bottom 3 teams in the league get relegated to the next tier. That means that they get demoted to the 2nd tier of English football. In the 2nd tier, the teams that finish in the top 3 get promoted to the 1st division (premiere league). The bottom 3 teams in the 2nd tier get relegated to the 3rd tier and so on and so forth. It might seem a little confusing at first but this will give you all the info if you want all the details: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_football_league_system

As of this moment Chelsea are currently 3rd in the premiere league behind Manchester United and Manchester City.

In the first division the top 4 teams qualify for what's called the Champion's league (what we won for the first time last year, which is really, really fucking big deal). The top teams from the top leagues in Europe (English league, German league, Spanish League, etc.) qualify for the Champion's league each year. It's basically a big knockout tournament to determine who is the best club (the ""champion"") in Europe, which is why it's such a prestigious trophy. Again if you want the details have a read here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League

There are also what are called domestic cup competitions. These are knockout competitions between the teams in each country among themselves. The English teams compete for their own cups, the Spanish compete for theirs, etc. They take place at the same time as the league competitions and feature the same teams but are a completely separate competition from the leagues. There are two big ones in English football are the F.A. Cup (football association cup, the FA is the governing body in English football. Each country has their own) and the League Cup.

A few players you should know:

* John Terry is our captain and he is a legend for the club and a saint. The media loves to shit on him but that is neither here nor there. He is, in my opinion and the opinion of most everyone here, a really good guy. He plays defense for us, his position is center back (CB).

* Frank Lampard is another club legend currently playing for us. He is a midfielder and is 3 goals away from becoming the highest scoring Chelsea player of all time. He will break that record very soon.

* Didier Drogba no longer plays for us, but he was our main striker for the past 8 years and was pivotal in helping us win the Champion's League last year. He left on the best possible terms and we love him to death. He is also a club legend.

There are other really important players you'll need to know, but you'll learn them as you go.

Right now we have a lot of young, talented players and the future is looking very bright. Our manager situation is pretty iffy but that's an entirely different subject.

Also let's be realistic here, you will get criticized for being a bandwagon fan by supporters of other teams and you will get lots of nasty things said to you but they can all fuck right off because their opinion means jack shit. Why you like a team is your reason and your reason alone, don't let anyone else dictate your allegiances. Best thing to do is just ignore the people who give you grief because it's not a winning battle.

There's a LOT more to learn but hang around here and you'll start to pick up on things. Ask questions if you don't know someone, everyone is pretty friendly on this board for the most part.

That was a really brief overview of things but hopefully it answered some of your questions. Feel free to ask anyone here about specifics, I guarantee everyone will be more than willing to share their opinions and insight on things.

I think what's clear is that we do need a bit of veteran experience and leadership. So, I do hope that we find someone in the summer to bring those qualities to the squad.

Two things that I would say regarding the summer is this:

* While Stewart Downing's improvement has been immense this season, I can't shake the feeling that he's still not quite right for this squad and this system. I pull for Downing to continue to improve because I think that will only improve his transfer value in the summer.

* I know players like Lucas don't grow on trees but our squad looks so much stronger when Lucas is in the squad and a bit lost when he is injured. Perhaps players like Joe Allen will emerge as an understudy to Lucas but I think we need an experienced veteran comfortable in the Lucas role in case Lucas suffers another injury, has a dip in form, or simply needs to be rested.

Still plenty of time left in the season to see which players emerge and which players fall. A lot can change in between now and the start of the summer window.",0,1361169893,null,0,false,0,c8h3ew5,t3_18py7x,t1_c8h3ew5,t3_18py7x,null,1431326660,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

More than a couple of hundred years ago, almost everyone on the planet would have been employed making food for themselves, and a little extra to sell on. Now, farmers are a tiny minority. Something like 90% of the population lost their jobs in that process. Likewise, all the old trades are basically dead- dressmaker, tanner, hooper, blacksmith, printer (newspapers used to employ huge numbers of people to physically arrange bits of metal for printing). The bridges in London wiped out the jobs of the watermen (there's still a guild of watermen, who put in a formal complaint every time a bridge is proposed), the cars the jobs of the people looking after and breeding horses, and so on. We have already been through perhaps three or four cycles of job extinction.

I think what is happening now, with ongoing automation, is also not so much that jobs are being lost, but that unskilled jobs are being lost. And that introduces several serious problems. First, people without in-demand and/or transferable skills are being thrown on the scrapheap, or being put in positions of ever reduced power, and that is socially divisive. Second, our culture and society are inflexible, and we will find it very difficult to adapt.  Lots of working class kids are taught that being well-educated is pretentious, and that does not bode well for their future in a high-skill economy. Lots of middle-class kids are educated in a purely abstract way, without any reference to the real economy, and its new demands. No matter how interested someone is in classical literature, it is cruel and futile to put huge numbers of people through that style of education with very little prospect of turning it to use in the real world.

IT WAS THE INVESTMENT BANKS TRADING DERIVATIVES AND VALUING THEM GREATER THAN THE ACTUAL DEBT THAT CAUSED THE BUBBLE THAT CAUSED THE CRISIS.

It wasn't people taking out a 100%+ mortgage. It wasn't an overheated property market in the US and UK. It wasn't people using their credit cards for things they never needed. It was the investment banks conducting high risk trading to overinflate the value of the products they were trading. I was working with a few banks when it all went south. All the fancy apps they had to manage Structured Investment Vehicles off the back of Credit Default Swaps and Collateralized Debt Obligations.

By [mid-2007](http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1723152,00.html) the CDS market was around $45 trillion but the combined corporate and municipal bond and SIV market was less than [$25 trillion](http://www.rkmc.com/publications/articles/credit-default-swaps-from-protection-to-speculation), meaning that about $20 trillion of the CDS market were bets on the possibility of a credit event of a specific credit asset not owned by either party to the CDS contract.

As for your moral arguments blaming it all on the consumer, I'm not surprised you're being downvoted when predatory marketing tactics were being used by nearly all the banks and the banks were freely lending in that way.

The taxation issue is an interesting one. I think food choices are so deeply ingrained in people by the time they begin purchasing their own food that you risk ending up with the majority still eating the processed crap, but just paying more for it. 

The real problem is education, cooking is a skill and an absolutely essential one. If your parents never teach you to  cook and you grow up pulling boxes out of the freezer then it's a difficult cycle to break for the indervidual. If we want future Generations to cook for themselves then cookery should feature much more heavily from the first to last years of education.

You're right, there was a time when Banks were risk-averse and didn't make stupid lending decisions (like credit products for benefit claimants, which was a beyond retarded idea and should never have been allowed) and yes, the Banks started doing stupid things like that to fund risky investments after the merger of high street and investment Banks (and yes, that should not have been allowed, but the FSA allowed it to go ahead) but there was a *massive* drive when I worked for a Bank to lend. 

The attitude towards lending was, in a massive way, shaped by the Governments attitude at the time, of giving people credit, letting them buy shit, and keeping people happy and satisfied and distracted.


I stick by my point - nobody, at any point was ever forced into taking out a credit product they could not afford. Nobody. Factor in the 14 day cooling off period, in which people could decide to cancel, and there is no reason at all for anyone to have been lumbered with a massive credit card debt other than stupidity or greed or a lack of fucks given on their part.

Yes, the banks should have kept investment and HS Banking separate. it was profoundly stupid to ever merge the two. But off the back of it, nobody was made to take out loans, mortgages when they had no deposit, etc.

The responsibility for this lies with pretty much everyone - the banks, the FSA and the consumers.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"One thing I think you have to take account of is how reduced is a parent's capability to control the way their child thinks, through what their child watches, listens to or reads, compared with previous generations. My parents grew up in households which barely had TV, most of the contact with the outside world was with friends of the family, mostly through the closed and homogenous community of the church, or with children in similar positions. Obviously this has elements which are extremely negative, but modern media, with multi-channel TV, and particularly the internet, means that children now are bombarded in a much more ubiquitous and sophisticated way with messages that are crafted to make them desire these products. 

Parents have to be extremely sophisticated themselves to work out ways of counteracting the influence, and, practically speaking, they have to live in communities which are taking joint action to counteract the message*. If a child is taught by adverts that eating McDonald's is part of a happy, normal childhood (as I was when I was younger), a parent cannot counteract that if all the other children are going to McDonald's with their parents. Ubiquitous advertising and media availability mean that these things can never now be an issue just for a single family, they are issues for the whole of society. And when it gets to the stage where [33% of 11 year olds are considered overweight or obese](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19661085), that's when I think we have to stop complaining about the nanny state, and start finding pragmatic and reasonable ways for large sections of the population to avoid growing up with permanent and debilitating medical problems.

It's a sorry day where in order for a human being to have a discussion of any sort he has to be spitting with rage. Have you never seen someone type a response without losing their shit? Really? I'm sat here with a face straighter than an arrow, my blood pressure is perfectly fine.

&gt; Mario was great for the club, he's arguably done more for the club as a brand then any of those players would do as players.

This is true. He has definitely brought attention to the club, both good and bad, but I like players who play well, so I have a bias.

&gt; It is very easy when you've become a Oil-rich club to seem like a faceless corporation, having Balotelli gave our club characters that fans of other teams might not know we have as a club so yes I will miss him.

He is an expensive character though. You cannot buy someone just for their character. I believe in the team, the squad performance, and if I could swap a few big named, under performing stars for some low key, hard working stars, and be 2 points behind united rather than 12, would I? You can bet your mum's house I would.

&gt; I was very critical about Mario on here, have been all season, me and devineman have had one of his many arguments on here about Balotelli but like I said, I'm still sad to see the back of him but it is what is best for both of us.

At least we can agree on that.

&gt; As someone who lived in Manchester, I saw Balotelli a couple of times when he's been around and it is absolutely impossible to see him and not be made happy by that, even if he was just walking into a club. I will miss that.

Again, this is not a team based desire, it is a personal one of yours, and of other fans. Sure it was cool to see him out in his ""camouflaged"" car, but unless he's going to drive it onto the pitch and score for us, it's irrelevant.

true,kinelfire,null,null,"It would indeed be a separate crime. However, trying someone for multiple crimes at the same time increases the chances of securing a conviction. If a rapist is only identified after the convicted (a 90+% chance they won't), the prior conviction cannot be mentioned in the new trial, as you are aware. Rapists don't always start off by raping someone, nor do they limit themselves to one victim. There's a good reason that Strathclyde police are wanting to find the man who has already assaulted 3 women - escalation. 

I've said it before; the police do not identify suspects willy-nilly. They only do so if they have good reason (based on what they believe to be solid evidence) and possibly if they need help finding the suspect. The law regarding suspect anonimity was changed for a reason, and not because the government of the day believed that every single alleged rapist would and should be named. Believe me, they are not. You would notice the 16,000 names in the papers. 

The police being bad at investigating rape tends to put people off reporting and continuing on to the courts, rather than leading to supporting maliciously false allegations. Perhaps you would like to familiarise yourself with attrition rates? 

Lastly, that the majority of rapes aren't reported isn't the biggest problem. The biggest problem is that people prefer to believe it wasn't rape because she (usually) was drunk or high, was wearing revealing clothing, didn't say no, didn't say no loudly enough, let him into her bed, kissed him, didn't fight back, didn't fight back hard enough, was married to the guy, had gone out with him previously, he's a nice guy, he wouldn't do things like that, he's not a violent person, he's been my friend for so long and I know him so well, she's crazy, she's regretting the consensual sex they had, she wants revenge because of x, y and z. That's the biggest problem. If the amount of energy spent on minimising and excusing rape was directed instead to teaching people to not rape, the conviction rates might be a bit better. And that's also why it's much better to take an alleged rapist to court to be tried for multiple counts of the same crime, rather than to try them several times.

And, seriously, how often do you see allegations of rape on the front page of The Sun? ",0,1361181708,null,0,false,0,c8h57al,t3_18nuya,t1_c8h57al,t1_c8h4yvt,null,1431327577,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Don't make junk food more expensive, make healthier food cheaper. When you have a fixed budget that you need to get 21 meals out of, plus the extras of household cleaning and personal care, you need to go for the cheapest option foods which is often the most unhealthy. 

The cost of fruit and veg is ridiculous at the moment, and the cheaper fruit and veg not only tastes awful, (particularly fruit) but rots very quickly. Farm shops/markets are good in that the produce is often cheaper than the supermarkets, and better quality, but it still isn't that cheap. Plus you often need a car or public transport to be able to reach these places, yes you could walk but lugging heavy bags of fruit and veg back home just isn't an option for some. 

They also need to focus of food manufacturers, no one seems to have the balls to take on Tesco et al and compel them to make their cheap convenience foods healthier. Tax *them* heavily when they use shit quality ingredients in their basic value lasagne, and then fill it full of salt, sugar and fat to compensate for the poor taste. The recent horse meat scandal underlines the need to regulation on what goes into foods.
You can try and make people accountable all day long, but unless you tackle the source then it will make little difference.

He pointed out that the rise of ""lmproved"" devices - such as cars that are capable of greater reliability and higher speeds - do not increase efficiency, or reduce the requirement for human toil, in fact the opposite is frequently the case.

He also pointed out that the efficiencies which are an inherent part of improved systems of work, tend to alienate people from the work that they do, and this results in lower self esteem and damage to the fabric of society. (So whereas in a ""poorer"" economy we'd have had a few butchers and a bakers and a shoemenders and tailors a hundred other trades in any small town, we've now largely lost those skills and replaced them with fairly generic ""retailers"")

This isn't to say technological progress is an inherently bad thing - he wasn't a Luddite, and neither am I (he typed on his computer). But if its benefits to society are by no means to be taken for granted.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;There is no capability to totally remove all benefits from a person and leave them literally homeless and peniless.


Actually there is. Assuming you are claiming job seekers allowance and then getting your rent or mortgage paid for you because you are claiming job seekers, and then getting your council tax paid and rates assisted with, it all hinges on you being on job seekers. As soon as the job seekers benefit is removed the other benefits are automatically removed too. 

This man will now loose his job seekers as the main condition of job seekers allowance is that you ""need to prove you are actively looking for work"", and he is not looking for work and infact actively avoiding it. He will go to his next job seekers appointment (every 2 weeks), they will immediately pause his benefit, he will have a mini trial a few weeks later with a manager and possibly a county court circuit judge or magistrate, they will find him guilty because they always do and he will be kicked off job seekers and all his other benefits for 3 years. 

I know a few people this has now happened to, and the current government loves doing it. Depending how long he's been claiming for they may ask him to pay some or all of the money back too and possibly give him a suspended prison sentence. They can do all this from right inside the job centre, you don't go to any court or have any trial with a jury or anything.

I appreciate that you want the work, I appreciate that you're a hard worker, but if I was employing someone then the last thing I'd want is them driving off the road from exhaustion on the way home from my warehouse.

I would do anything to ensure that doesn't happen - it's far more palatable to have the lads complaining about their hours than it is to put them in danger.

If you don't like that explanation, then I'd probably rather hire two people for 8 hour days and get full efficiency out of them, than employ one person for a 16 hour day, but have him incapable of picking at full capacity during the second half of his shift. 

You say that your employer is creating more hassle for themselves by limiting your hours.

true,guernican,null,null,"Well, I agree with some of what you're saying, which is why I think we're talking at cross purposes. 

Attrition rates are poor: spectacularly so. But it's not the choice of the victim as to whether a case goes to court: it's down to the work of the police in preparing the case and the prosecutor in deciding whether there's a reasonable chance of conviction. And we're not talking, here, about police identifying - or publicising - suspects. It's one thing to go to the public with serious intent to uncover a putative mass of past criminality from one individual, and it's another for newspapers to link a suspect's name to a specific case, or series of cases, because the cases themselves are ""news-worthy"", by which I mean sensational, or grotesque, or whatever. I'm also trying to think of an instance where the police have gone to the public mid-trial to drum up more evidence for a suspect. It seems unlikely, but I'm happy to be proved wrong if you have an example. 

But the real problem with your argument is that you're using a statistical approach to answer a specific point. It doesn't matter that 15,999 of the year's rape cases aren't mentioned in any newspaper. It doesn't matter which page of the Sun ""Paedo Dave"" features on. Whatever the overall percentage of ""rightness"" is, when it's wrong it's always 100% for the person in question. 

I'm quite interested in your point about teaching people not to rape, though. I wonder if we could expend the energy pursuing, investigating and prosecuting rapists rather than setting up education plans to explain to people that something absolutely any sane and reasonable human being would view as a crime is... uhm... a crime.  I have a pretty liberal outlook on the world but I wonder if a fearsomely effective conviction rate and stringent sentencing might also not be a good deterrent. Unless you're making a wider point about society's violently sexualised nature in 2013, in which case I can't help but agree.

Just to get a Single bedroom flat through the council i had to wait 2 years and i was at the time a med-high priority. The people on benefits who are in a 2 bed place but only use 1 bedroom will be penalised until they can be moved into something smaller. They won't be able to afford a private rented place, let alone get a deposit and then there is the decreased security that comes with private renting. 

On paper, it is a great idea. In reality... There are too many flaws and far to many people will fall through the cracks.

These are right-wing. I accept that the BBC does show these kind of programs, but I believe that this is part of it being a rounded and balanced show.

It is also a socialist construction. A service for all. This is the opposite of right-wing, so again, a balance.


&gt;For the last three years, it's also shown a strong tendency to swallow the government line on economic issues uncritically.

Economic policies are a small fraction of government. How do you expect them to go against this? Some programs do question and ask if this is the correct course of action, but they can't put out a program of David Frost just saying, ""Oi, Cameron, you're economic policies suck."" The BBC can't oppose the government, otherwise it IS then showing a political side. Not opposing one view does not equal supporting the other.

Which is exactly my point? There isn't enough social housing. A lot of the people hit by this will be people who 'need' X bedrooms, but are living in Y. Where are you going to move them to? There simply isn't enough X bedroom houses in most areas. Instead, you're going to cost them even more, pushing them further towards (and in many cases across) the poverty line. 

You're right, there is no magic wand we can just wave to ensure everyone has housing that suits their needs. But that doesn't mean there's suddenly a reason to impoverish people because of it. 

That's not taking into account the tax also hits people who should (in my opinion) be exempt. For example, people whose children are currently serving in the army.

I'd much rather a campaign to ensure kids are educated about their diet as they are about tying their shoelaces or brushing their teeth. The vast bulk of any diet problem stems from that fact 95% of people couldn't tell you what they eat.

No amount of taxes or advert fiddling can help solve an issue of control. There is no shortage of stuff people could binge on. What is needed is to make measuring and recording diet a routine the same way brushing your teeth is. Every child should weigh themselves once a week and keep a diary of their diet. That would solve most of your problems up front.

Those are actions to stop a third party shortening our lives. That is completely different to punishing someone for their health choices.

Some history for you: Gianfranco Zola signed for Chelsea from Parma in 1996. He had been seen as the replacement for Diego Maradona whilst at Napoli, and was a hugely technically gifted player. Eventually (future Chelsea manager) Carlo Ancelotti decided he no longer fit into his system at Parma, so he joined us for £4.5m. This was the start of the European revolution (as I like to call it). He wore the number 25 shirt, which has since been retired. Franco was voted the Chelsea greatest ever player in the Centinary season, and to this day I stand by that.

Essentially cooking came to represent everything that was wrong with society (i.e. women forced to stay at home), so effectively part of the agenda was to have girls in schools take other things - which they were successful in doing. So cooking classes kind of died out (girls weren't taking it, boys weren't taking it, so why have it?).       

The ""problem"" is that the strategy was wrong. Instead of getting girls out of the cooking classes, they instead should have got the boys INTO them. Right now in school kids are asked to make a choice: cooking OR wood-shop OR electrical engineering OR metal-shop.    

Now cooking is ""boring"" but useful. Those other classes are ""fun"" but almost useless. Which do you think a 14 year old kid is going to pick?

I'll use an analogy. The same tactic is used in warfare:

If you kill an enemy soldier, the enemy is down one soldier and their battle effectiveness is reduced accordingly. 20 soldiers, 1 killed, now at 95% effectiveness.

But If you injure an enemy soldier it takes several soldiers to carry them off the battlefield and you tie up their medical resources. The cost is much larger.

Accusations were made against him, the police investigated and found enough evidence to arrest him. The naming may have been in the hopes that it might compel any other victims to come forward, if indeed he has raped anyone. His arrest was a result of Operation Yew Tree, or one of the related investigations. The Savile investigation has shown that publicising the case brought more victims forward. 

If he is innocent, you can be sure that he will publicly say so, and barring media interest elsewhere, he will be given the platform to do so.

true,G_Morgan,cnty-wales,Wales,"I don't think so. There are countless tasks someone could do. They seem trivial to our culture (and that cultural bias is a core problem when dealing with unemployment) but in future it will be more acceptable for stuff that ""doesn't really need to be done"" to be the focus of employment.

Essentially the path of our mass employment has over time moved up the Maslow hierarchy. In historic times our focus was primarily on providing primary resources for basic survival. Food, fire, shelter, etc. As time went on those became more secure. Industrialisation really marked the final word in securing the base of the Maslow hierarchy. It also heralded the start of the move up the hierarchy towards employment around leisure and self-actualisation.

As time goes on more and more of employment will be near the peak of the pyramid. In truth the pyramid is misleading. There are far more opportunities for employment when your realm of work is the endless expanse of stuff that is strictly unnecessary. This is also why ""OMG manufacturing"" is such a silly idea. Stuff low down the hierarchy is always going to be less valuable.

There are two real problems with developing this reality:

1. Public perception - I.E. not a real job. Oh you teach someone to play an instrument. That is really useful! You make games. Nobody can eat a game!

2. Resource allocation - Our current systems are set up for distribution based upon need. This hasn't really been adapted for the modern reality where having Sky TV, an iPod, eating at a restaurant and going to the gym is the economy. Which is why we are actually trying to squeeze welfare to the bottom of the Maslow hierarchy. At some point government is going to have to deal with the fact new economic growth is based upon want rather than need. It is going to have to deal with resource allocation accordingly.

As it stands we cannot yet automate our leisure time but it is still something that has value. The instructor for your kids violin lessons has value and people will have to work to pay for that.

The ""best"" cooks are put to work serving foie gras on a silver spoon and I'm only half jesting. On a level above yourself it has been decided that cooking is a lower class concern (not in any Marxist sense, but one of de-prioritisation), but certainly it became work that isn't allowed to be labour, and so much so that the skills that used to be passed from generation to generation **for free** are now largely lost leaving people of similar predicament dependent on perhaps ready meals, junk food or worse, McDonalds. Do you think you can learn anything about food working at such a place? Do you think it likely that some one like you has anything to learn from someone who is in such employment? At a communal level there are a lack of teachers and a lack of skills, those with the skills are moved somewhere else in the economy.

Even if you're sitting naked in the middle of a true wilderness, the tablet/phone/whatever you're reading this on was designed by somebody.  And as technology has become more complex, more minds are required to design it.  The circuitry, the code, the materials that went into that device, the aesthetics, the ergonomics, all of that is becoming more and more complex, and more and more people are involved in it.  And the number of alternative products is growing.  While mass production has led to less flexibility and fewer alternative products, it is now becoming more flexible again.  3D printing is the almost clichéd example, but it's a strong one.  More importantly, digital production has opened up doors to millions of complex and varied niche products.  As the marketing slogan burned into our brains goes, 'there's an app for that'.  In fact, there's probably a multitude.  As such, more bespoke, tailored products aimed at more specific markets might proliferate.  And what does that mean? More designers.  

The argument for less production and less consumption is an unusual one, as the two don't relate perfectly.  If we recycle more and waste less, which will become easier, again due to more efficient manufacturing, then we can continue to produce.

true,myimportantthoughts,cnty-uk,It's grim up North London,"A lot of economists have been making predictions about this very issue for generations, often predicting that working a shorter (eg. 10 hour) week will become normal. 

In Scandinavia workers work fewer hours than in the UK and have much better leave for sickness and maternity/paternity. They are also more efficient and earn more on average.

One answer (that I would subscribe to) is that while work will not die out, manual labour will generally become a thing of the past, or something of a hobby rather than something that 200 people are doing in a factory. 

One economic theory is that economies move through different 'stages': primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary etc.
Primary economies are based on agriculture and natural resources, usually in a labour intensive way. eg. Zambia today, Britain in 15th Century

Secondary economies are based on manufacture and processing materials, with labour and machines eg. China today, Britain in 1850

Tertiary economies are based on services, with more complex technology and less manual labour eg. UK today

Quaternary economies are based on technological innovation like nanotechnology, computer science and bio 
engineering. Some parts of the silicon valley in the US might be described as Quaternary sectors.

So we will still (theoretically) be working, but not on the same sorts of jobs. With quaternary sector jobs increasing, it is very difficult to break into the market with zero skills. Perhaps there will be a 'underclass' of people whose unskilled labor is now replicated by machines, but people with skills in medicine, computer science, etc are unlikely to be unemployed in the near future.

and cycling velodromes require that exercise be taxed along with excluding any that cannot afford it. If one has to make special effort to run on a treadmill then that hints at a poor lifestyle and poor urban design. Why can't people walk to work, or cycle to work? 1:30hr each day is given to sitting in a car for many just for the commute, 24hours a week is given to the TV (on average), and physical activity is marginalised to the odd 15 minutes here and there on concrete playgrounds or a few hours on a wednesday afternoon where you can get abused for ""not being good enough at the pursuit you don't want to even be doing"". (Not ragging on sport, I was approach national level athletics at one point but why does it have to tightly connected with machismo and over competitiveness?)

Serious and not a condescending question: why can't you or don't you cycle to work? More questions: digging the garden, chopping firewood, picking apples, working a hammer or saw? We have a culture of doing nothing and then paying for the privilege of running nowhere on a rubber track and lifting weights for no end—but yeah, let's tax salty food and shrink fizzy drinks. ಠ_ಠ",0,1361199057,null,0,false,0,c8h7esf,t3_18qm7c,t1_c8h7esf,t1_c8h7925,null,1431328615,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I'm all for this, but I think we need to take each case on it's own merits and only penalise those who genuinely do not use the spare rooms. 

If you've got a Dad who sometimes has a kid stay over, then they should have a spare room. If you've got an older couple who have no use for the two spare bedrooms they have, then they should move.  

These are not private individuals homes. they are housing stock owned by the council and should be used in the most efficient manner possible. 

""And this is the accommodation they were eventually offered after that fight, but now the government have suddenly move the goalposts and they're going to have to fight again.""

I have said it before and I will say it again - there is *nothing* stopping people arranging a house swap themselves. That would mean the could find an area that they like themselves, and the housing would then be used in a more suitable manner.

I find it sickening that people see council houses as *theirs* and want to occupy a house that is to big for them. And I say that as someone who grew up in one.

Therefore, it's honestly not obscenely expensive and there are no contracts. I go 5 mornings a week, I train in the pool 3 mornings a week doing 45 minutes and around 2250-2500m. The other 2 mornings are 1 hour in the gym on free-weights and resistance machines.

I don't ""run on a treadmill"" I use the pool as I can't run on the street as I have an on-going ankle injury, which won't stand up to being run on repeatedly, as such I have to swim to get the majority of my cardiovascular exercise. I use the gym at the centre to make the most of the free weights and machines for resistance training, as I don't have the space or the money to purchase and store my own.

I could cycle to work (I do own a bike, but remember that they and their equipment also cost money!) but it's dark at this time of year, the roads have cars doing around 50-60, they're often narrow or bendy, they often have lots of water/ice or pot-holes on them and other drivers behavior make for an unpleasant experience. 

I don't have a garden (nor can I afford somewhere with one) and even if I did it would be a tiny patch of land, not something you could work. Similarly I don't have a fireplace or an apple-tree (what is this, The Good Life?).

I think your questions are valid, but I think you have an extremely distorted view of our gyms and leisure centres in this country. I find they're social places, where I find I get more than just working out on my own. They also offer equipment and instruction you won't find at home or in a park. The truth is I love to go to the pool in the morning and swimming gives my brain some time to just shut down and concentrate on one thing. I find the pool is very isolating on the senses and is actually quite meditative. 

The truth of the matter is that for those of us who make our living in offices and in other ""sedentary"" workplaces we have to make room in our days to be consciously active.

true,Cepheid,cnty-uk,Nomad,"I don't generally subscribe to that philosophy. It is fairly common knowledge that in history technology doesn't destroy the number of jobs, it redistributes them by creating new ones.

Consider where we are now, MOST people who want/can/are able to do jobs are employed, and we live in a world of 7 billion.

There will always be things to do, and as technology increases, our education systems will have to match it.

I know a few people with the same fear you have, and I think that the education system is generally where the problem lies, our education systems are improving and society appears to (for the most part) support the number of university graduates we produce, but the rate at which technology is improving in the modern era is explosive in comparison.

We are already reaching a point where education systems can't keep up with the demand for technical knowledge, e.g. Doctors, Nurses, Engineers, Scientists. Pretty soon I think there will be **heavy** pressure to encourage students to do degrees and courses that are in demand.

Just look at the tuition fees, tripling the fees already makes courses with low contact hours look like bad value for your debt. Why do a Literature degree with 6 contact hours a week and a heavy emphasis on reading and essay writing by yourself, when for the same money you could be an Engineer doing 24 contact hours and have recruitment agencies banging down your door to give you a job?

What I'm saying is, humans live in dynamic systems, and as the supply for bin-men drops, the demand for bin collecting machine operators, technicians and maintenance men increases.

We don't lose anything, we just get things done more efficiently, with less man hours, less money spent that can be spent elsewhere, such as Entertainment, Medical research, Space exploration, Sports, Writing, etc.

Look how far we have come, imagine explaining to a peasant in the 1200s about how we have cars and washing machines and central heating, they would certainly be intrigued to know what we do with all the time that frees up, yet we still manage to feel busy.

There will be unemployment bumps in the road on this journey - the biggest I can forsee are driverless cars, but human civilization will recover and always have something to do and something to work for.

Nasri would be the type of player worth picking up if it was on the cheap because he's potentially got great re-sale value when regular game time means he hits a bit of form again and decides to chase the money again (I mean, imagine how much Sturridge is hypothetically worth now after just a few games?

No out comes are not better. NHS is shit compared to even the US. I've lived in both. I lived in several places including one third world country who's health care still better then NHS.

Key words ""for the maximum number of people."" Private provides the best care with out a stipulation.

No free means: Without cost or payment EVER. Stop redefining words. By your fucked up ""logic"" private health care is also free. If you by a ticket to a show/movie it's free at the point of delivery. You just do this to make the US think you actually get free health care and they think yo do. Not to mention you have to pay 8 quid per prescription no matter how small it is. You have to pay the dentist yourself. Both of these are covered fully by private insurance that cost less then the seperate insurance tax.

I just asked where to get this ""free"" health care. You are suggesting I leave my country because I asked a question? Really? Why? Yes, I would however prefer prefer something more capitalist. But my company pays my taxes for me so it doesn't affect me in any way.

You are saying it to be rude. ""If you don't like this stupid British thing you can get out. No I don't care how stupid it is. Or how much better it is else where. Fuck you tea hater. The UK does everything the best. I know this even though I've never been anywhere else.""

I'm not in the minority. I've just not been brain washed with the idea my country is gods gift to the world mantra the US and UK has.

You are not arguing with me because I am right and you are wrong. I down voted you only because you are NOT using facts you don't have any sources nor can I find any. You where being rude ""I'm not saying that to be rude"" is like saying I'm not a racist but. And you told me to leave my country. WTF? You are just saying random shit based on nothing.

Yes my 155 IQ has trouble reasoning. Sure that's the problem. Not you foolish illogical national pride.

Why can't we live where we work? I'm not having a go at your life style, but my aim is towards the collective backwards nature that can be found in nearly all of the environment and social constructs that are designed for us.

&gt; I don't have a garden (nor can I afford somewhere with one)...

Why the hell not!? There is so much being wasted, golf courses for one thing (another privatised and elitised use of space).

&gt; and even if I did it would be a tiny patch of land, not something you could work. Similarly I don't have a fireplace or an apple-tree (what is this, The Good Life?).

My point is that ""we"" have designed out any necessary physical activity, pushed it into leisure, given desk jobs to everyone, provided supermarkets that push crap food (what's nearest the checkout chocolate and OK magazines or fruit?), then ""we"" look on in disbelief when their is a health crisis. ""We"" don't even walk to the local shop anymore because it doesn't exist and Tescos is about a 2 miles away but even walking there if you were fit enough isn't an option because car extremism makes life hideous for anything else. Could you maintain your lifestyle of gym extremism† (as in that being nearly 100% of the source of exercise) if you had two children?

&gt; I could cycle to work (I do own a bike, but remember that they and their equipment also cost money!)

My bike cost me 80£ (70s racer), plus equipment, takes it to 150£ spread over a decade, so it's almost free.

Baylis did NOT invent a rechargeable battery. He did NOT invent the idea of charging a battery from a mechanical device.  He also did NOT invent wind-up radios!

Baylis's patent is for a ""Spring operated current generator for supplying controlled electric current to a load"". Basically it's a clever mechnical device that serves as a mechnical equivalent of a battery.

Unfortunately for him, his mechanical device is simply not needed, because real rechargeable batteries have improved.

So what he wants to do is bar people from building-up wind-up radios (which he has no patent on and didn't invent), using rechargeable batteries + wind-up (which he also didn't invent) --- despite the fact that batteries are a better technology than his ""mechnical battery"".

true,marmitesandwich,yorkshire,northern monkey,"The trip in general was varied - I could only make 3 full days of the week, so I was really at the mercy of the weather. The first day it pissed it down, we dicked about climbing rocks under a bridge. The second day it pissed it down from midday - we'd read the forecast so set off early and got up and down a little peak by 1pm, then lots of lounging around. 

Day 3 was the best forecast so we planned big trips and it paid off. The entire trip was worth it for the moment where we'd finally got up to the ridge in damp, cloudy weather - the clouds parted, sun came out and we had 360 degree views of endless mountains. It was properly stunning, like we were on top of the world. The ridge stretched ahead of us for miles and we were the only people up there. I'll be dreaming about it for the next year at least. It wasn't difficult in a technical way. Getting up to the ridge was a bit of a slog, I had a bad moment where it looked like I'd have to do the ridge without crampons (it was ok in the end), and parts of the ridge itself were quite intimidating. But all in, it was more a serious winter walk than mountaineering - big views and lots of snow for not too much effort.

true,Bigizz,null,null,"A bit about the present situation at the club: the current (hopefully interim) manager is Rafa Benitez. He is generally hated by Chelsea supporters because he managed Liverpool 5-8 years ago and said some demeaning things about Chelsea supporters (among a variety of other reasons). From an American perspective, imagine if Terry Francona went to manage the Yankees (only if Francona was a pompous ass) or if Bill Belicheck went to coach the Jets in a few years (only Rafa isn't at all regarded as a genius).

He took over as manager from Robero Di Matteo, who was fired in November. He guided the club to the Champions League &amp; FA Cup wins last season. It is clear that Abramovich didn't want Di Matteo to stay as manager (he was an interim manager at the time) but he was pressured to keep him in charge against his better judgment. Di Matteo is a club legend and the fans generally sing his name when the clock reads 16 minutes because he wore #16 as a player. They do this both to show their support of Di Matteo and to show their disdain over Rafa (it is much more the later these days).

This is a season of transition for Chelsea. Drogba (among others last season) left the club and were replaced by a bunch of great young talent (Hazard, Oscar, Moses, etc. These players are the future of the club. The season started of brilliantly but there have been many growing pains. It seems likely that other club legends (like Lampard this offseason and possibly Terry in a season or two) are going to be shown the door in an effort to further rebuild the squad (again drawing the ire of many supporters).

Of course central to the Chelsea story is Fernando Torres. Speaking mostly from my own personal opinion, Torres was purchased from Liverpool a few seasons back for an insane amount of money. He was at one time the most exciting striker on the planet but came in as damaged goods and is well past his best. He was a colossal waste of money but Abramovich seems unwilling to eat the huge investment made in him so he still plays a big role despite his struggles. For me, Torres &amp; his role was a central reason that Ancelotti, Villas Boas &amp; Di Matteo were all fired over the past few seasons.

The main goal for Chelsea the rest of this season is to finish in the top 4 of the Premire Leauge in order to qualify for next seasons Champions League (ideally top 3 to avoid having to play a qualifying round this summer). The club is also involved in the FA Cup and the Europa League (a Champions League type tournament with weaker clubs and not nearly as prestigious). The club has a chance of winning both the FA Cup and the Europa League but neither are as important as a top 4 league finish (I know it sounds strange)

So why the hate on gyms? If you can do all that then you clearly spent a lot of time in one.

&gt;Why can't we live where we work? I'm not having a go at your life style, but my aim is towards the collective backwards nature that can be found in nearly all of the environment and social constructs that are designed for us.

I can't speak for everyone else but the town where my office is based is very expensive and has very little housing in it. As a consequence I'm forced to live somewhere else, I'd love to live within walking distance of my office, however I am priced out of that area.

&gt;My point is that ""we"" have designed out any necessary physical activity, pushed it into leisure, given desk jobs to everyone, provided supermarkets that push crap food (what's nearest the checkout chocolate and OK magazines or fruit?), then ""we"" look on in disbelief when their is a health crisis. ""We"" don't even walk to the local shop anymore because it doesn't exist and Tescos is about a 2 miles away but even walking there if you were fit enough isn't an option because car extremism makes life hideous for anything else.

Hey I didn't build society, I just work here. I'm much better off at my desk job than I would be in more physical work, that's not really my fault, I understand the implications of this trade-off and substitute active pass-times into my life.

I know I can't make immediate and effective changes to society as a whole, so I therefore make the changes to myself. I hope that society will change, but I have little time or resources to push for this myself.

What would you propose?

&gt;Could you maintain your lifestyle of gym extremism† (as in that being nearly 100% of the source of exercise) if you had two children?

Yes, as I said I go in the morning before work, all I have to do is leave an hour earlier (it's no more inconvenient than going to work already is). I don't consider it ""extreme"" in fact it's only slightly more than the government's medical advisers recommend to people. We're used to a sedentary society so whenever someone regularly exercises people consider it ""extreme"", I resent this as it seems to say that those who are active are ""abnormal"". In truth I follow the training schedule I do because I enjoy it, the same as those who plonk down in front of the TV every day enjoy that.

&gt;My bike cost me 80£ (70s racer), plus equipment, takes it to 150£ spread over a decade, so it's almost free.

So you have no other costs in that decade? £150 to cover all maintenance and parts including your time spent doing that maintenance work? I think you undervalue yourself or you are a bit cheap. Would £150 cover a decade worth of inner tubes, oil, replacement helmets, batteries for lights, chains, gear and brake maintenance, while you use the bike 5 days a week to cover more than 20 miles a day?

&gt;It was a question I already knew the answer to because I use the awful infrastructure everyday, suffer the abuse of road-raging cagers and general negligence.

You don't drive do you? Or otherwise you don't drive often, if you did you wouldn't see a car as a ""cage"", you remind me very much of one of my more militant friends. 

My car is a means to an end, I drive it responsibly and safely. It's not fast or flash, it's not new and the most valuable aspect of it for me is that it's reliable. My girlfriend tells me that I have extremely sharp reactions and that she feels completely safe as a passenger when I am behind the wheel. I don't speed, I find that doing so merely makes you arrive at your destination fraction earlier but infinitely more stressed. I also don't ""rage"" as I don't have much anger behind the wheel, I find that exercise has helped regulate my mood.

Don't lump all car users in with those who are poor drivers, I expect you don't like being lumped in with the fixie riding idiots that don't follow traffic law and actually practice violence against other road users and their vehicles. Let's not make this a road-war argument.

I do sympathise with you, I wish my council would be effective in their infrastructure changes, instead of installing woefully inadequate and often dangerous ""cycle paths"", which nobody uses. If there was a route I could cycle on my commute I would absolutely use my bike more often.

I think the points you make are valid, but they're not currently conceivable solutions to the problems you wish to resolve. I think the most valid and immediately achievable option is to educate people about how they eat and then to try to get them to be more active. I think that reforming society will happen slowly and will only happen when the majority of people want it to.

His notion, that it is just English, is a complete fallacy. The most recent study I could find, from 2005, lists 52% of all incidents, as English. Hardly points toward massive hordes of wreckless Englishmen in our hills.

http://www.mountainrescuescotland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Scottish-Mountain-Incidents-Report-1996-2005.pdf

I spend a great deal of time in the hills in winter, and this weekend, I was with several English people, all of whom were far more experienced than I. 

Anyway, I digress. 

There was a famous Scottish climber, possibly Dougal Haston, who once said that he climbed in the Alps as training for Scotland. Our dynamic weather system, and relatively low summits, all to often make for hazardous conditions. Last year 52 odd people died in the hills. It is par for the course, I am afraid, as the risk cannot be eliminated. The risks, however, are absolutely worth it. 

As you have shown, our winter landscape can be as breathtaking as any on the planet, as well as providing conditions to challenge the most hardened winter sportsperson. 

The ""stay in the pub"" armchair brigade can pipe down. The most exciting thing most of the UK population ever do is go shopping on a Saturday. You are more likely to die through obesity, heart disease or any other sedentary condition than a climber will by exposing himself to the mountains.

She had always taught my Sister and I that the house we grew up in was our home, but that she would move some day. She seemed to have a pretty mature attitude towards it (unlike a lot of people) and had accepted that because it was a council house, the three bedrooms and 60ftx25ft garden would some day be too bog for her, and it would therefore be unethical and immoral of her to keep it.

I'm sure she was sad. But my Mum arranged her house swap by chance. She had a card to pop in a friends door. She noticed a pregnant woman in one of the gardens of a neighbouring bungalow, and asked her if she was a council tenant, and would she like a bigger house.

First of all, don't accuse me of being a fickle fan. Being a realist about things is not being fickle. I have supported this club for 23 years and seen plenty of ""future stars"" fade away no matter where they went. Sterling may very well turn out to be a great player in a few years time, but I would really like to win matches now. Pointing out that Sterling does not seem to be a reliable player right now does not make me or anyone else fickle. Just because a player has a certain kit on does not mean you are required to believe he is going to come good eventually. That kind of thinking, by club staff in the past, is partly why we are now a mid table club.

The other reason youths don't make it in football is, of course, that a lot of youth players turn out to not be that good. The smart clubs (and fans) are the ones who don't waste years clinging to the hope that someone will finally prove themselves.

* Break up Ivanovic and Cahill as a pair. Neither one has looked sharp recently. I'd even like to see Luiz get back in the CB pair next to Terry but that's just me personally. JT/Luiz and JT/Cahill are the top two pairs for me.

* Azpi gets the nod on form at RB but I'd give Ivan the start against physical teams and superior opposition. 

* Any pair that is not Lampard and Ramires would be best for midfield. Order of preference for me would be Mikel/Lampard followed by Mikel/Luiz followed by Mikel/Ramires. I'd use Ramires mostly to rest Lampard and I'd play him on the right wing    against certain teams. He never looks like an ideal winger but when used correctly on the wing he can change the dynamic of our play e.g. better defense, mid-field support, better counter-attacking. 

* Moses and Oscar are in a tight spot because they both deserve to start. I say give em a healthy rotation for a bit and let them fight it out. The competition will be good for them. Either can make an impact off the bench too so this is a nice problem to have. I like what Moses brings to the team but I'd probably pick Oscar because he's on a tear and I think he's got more potential in forming a mind-bending partnership with Mata and Hazard and it's worth the investment.

* Baaaa over Torres. 


So my personal choice...

Cech

Azpi Luiz JT Cole

Mikel Lampard

Oscar Mata Hazard

I'm not sure about that - the bit that got bombed (the news centre nearest the road) was only a few years old. The rest of the centre was unharmed and all the non-news channels stayed on air from TV Centre  as normal throughout the night* One of the good things about it in resilience terms is that the site is so big that bits can be left open when others are shut off. After the bomb they started 'invacuations' - when something like that happens they move people right down inside. 

I know a lot has been spent on making Broadcasting House secure and resilient but it is still a relatively compact site and very prominent, I'm not sure it will be that much better in similar circumstances

*Incidently, I know a couple of people who were there that night, one of them in channel playout said that they felt the monitor stacks rattle a bit but the first they knew about the bomb was when they saw it on Sky News (News 24 had been evacuated and was on a recorded loop by then)

The Sinhalese Buddhists used ethnic, religious, nationalist and racist bigotry to oppress the tamils who were well educated and under British rule overrepresented in public positions. The Sinhalese prevented them from any longer working in public office and progrom after progrom culminated in black July, 1983 when the Tamils were made homeless in their own land - 20,000 homes and businesses burnt out in two days, groups of sinhalese walking round with print outs of tamil addresses to attack. The UN officially classed the tamils as refugees after this. They couldnt go back home and the only people in that country who offered them support were the tamil tigers. Thus began the division of the country, the tigers grew so strong they had their own air force and navy. They also forced Tamil children to fight in battle. They sent children into war. Now none of this was the fault of the Tamil people who went from suffering under one regime to suffering under another. So the Sri Lankans took on the tigers in a mass assault and they won. 

But quite simply Sri Lanka broke internationally regarded rules of law about not killing civilians and have held their own war crimes trial and found themselves innocent of all crimes. Despite bombing a makeshift hospital on consecutive days and not allowing people to surrender. 

It is widely accepted they committed war crimes. 

The Sri Lankan leaders should be in front of the war crimes tribunal in the Hague.

Sri Lanka has become a virtual dictatorship, a place where people disappear in the night never to be seen again, white vans come along take your family and you never see them again. 

Mahindra Rajapakse has imprisoned his army chief during the war on trumped up charges. Has removed term limits. Has placed his family in charge of contract distribution in the government. Tried to get himself the right to take ownership of any private land he likes and because he was stopped, his government have sacked the chief justice because she got in his way. There is virtually no press freedom in sri lanka and it is 163rd out of 179 countries in  the reporters without borders press freedom table. 

Sri Lanka is a dictatorship in all but name, rajapakse is a war criminal and a tyrant.

I'd rather our country was a bit poorer than sell weapons to a cunt like that. We should do the honourable thing and arrest him and drag him to the hague by his ears kicking and screaming, he is a very fucking evil man. The modern equivalent of Idi Amin. 

So you are quite wrong, war is a bloody affair but those who break the rules and target civilians should be tried in the Hague not sold arms by the UK. But then again we have no morality when it comes to these things, money is worth more than human life to the defence industry.

The economist has covered Sri Lanka in some depth.

&gt;The number of calories produced in America, and available to American consumers, went from 3,200 in the 1970s and early 80s to 3,900 per person

That's a 700 calorie increase in consumption (in America, admittedly). You don't need to exercise less to gain a large amount of weight if you're eating 700 calories more. If you want to exercise enough to burn an extra 700 calories a day, try jogging for 5 hours, that should do it. 

Good luck finding anyone who has become obese because they used to jog 5 hours a day and stopped. Want to find people who have become obese because they're eating 700 calories more than they were? Go to America it's full of them, and there are plenty over here too.

[This](http://www.historyextra.com/feature/obesity-and-modern-lifestyle-what-can-we-learn-history) mentions 1920s calorie consumption for the low paid and unemployed as 2000-2300. Today, 2800-3200 is more typical; again, there's no way to do enough exercise to balance that increase.

It is essentially impossible to increase the amount of exercise the average person does to balance the increase in calorie consumption. The problem is the diet. The problem is the Western Industrialised Diet, full of highly processed foods essentially designed and engineered by food companies' ""food scientists"" to be overconsumed.

Look at ""low fat"" foods. Remove fat and most of the nutrition from a processed food, replace it with sugar and other artificial additives to compensate for the loss of flavour and you have a food-like substance which, because of the absence of fat and other substances which trigger satiety responses in the human body, leaves you hungry. So you eat more of it. So they sell more of it. And because of the sugar, there are just as many calories in the low fat pseudo-food as in the original, so you get fat.",0,1361210826,null,0,false,0,c8hat5a,t3_18qtey,t1_c8hat5a,t1_c8h8xte,null,1431330218,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

*Lampard could play back in the midfield (4-1-4-1), but he's just been so good that I figure he's more of a striker than Torres has been. Playing him up front would give a rotation between him, Ba, and Torres were two could play while one rests.

*Moses over Oscar because he gives more width to the attack. Oscar could be subbed in for Mata or Hazard, since all three seem to like to play similarly.

*Mikel due to the extra stability he adds to our defense, which has seemed kinda shakey lately. Ramires could be subbed/used if more attacking options are needed without sacrificing too much defensively, or Luiz.

*Included Azpi and Ivanovich in the same lineup simply because I couldn't pick one.

If the government said that they were going to reduce JSA by £10-20 there would be outrage as people would be genuinely concerned about people starving in the streets. However, if they can say that they are 'just restructuring the local housing stock' and really, 'it's just helping those who cannot get on the property ladder' etc. then you have people coming out in droves defending the cut.

Fix the net, We were the _only_ game (and a tournament one at that) to require the internet, it took forever for them (and Dreads intervention) to fix.

Give Dota a side hall, or just our own area, shouting at these events is part of LAN gaming (we love it!) but being surrounded by CoD players who shout every six seconds gives you a headache.

Dim the lights a bit? playing under fluorescents staring at a monitor for 12+ hours is beyond bad for you.

More TUP! despite one of our machines completely dying (twice) they were ideal and you'll attract foreign players/teams.

Something over the top of the desks, I know they're rented but flat wooden boards even 2cm's thick would fix it.

Different chairs? zero give in them.

There were two particular staff members (network guy with a pony tail and someone on a Mac near where Lapin was sitting) who were exceptionally helpful.

Thanks for supporting FCUKDota Winbar/Epic, I hope we can get more teams in attendance if you decide to host again, We'll definitely try to make an appearance.

Have a word with the caterers, the food was actually really good compared to the standard for this sort of event, just £1.50 for about 20 chips was a bit of a joke.

Also PS/2 to USB converters :DD

The blue lines indicate that the bottom of the mannequin on the left and on the right are 3 pixels apart from each other - coincidentally the top of the shield on the two badges are also exactly 3 pixels apart from one another.  They are identically sized images.

Exhibit B:

Here I've cropped the shirts and lined their edges up.  As you can see, either the three shirts have managed to fall identically over their respective mannequins, or they are all based on the same stock shirt image.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; So why the hate on gyms? If you can do all that then you clearly spent a lot of time in one.

I've been mostly throwing out ideas, but specifically hate for ""the gym"" is rather hate for our collective relationship with physical exercise and what typically going to ""the gym"" is all about. It's become something of a perjury—come January there are so many that make that resolution and as many that fail come February. Further more:

&gt; The primary reason for this was that Nautilus equipment allowed the health club (at the time known as the ""health spa"") industry to offer to the general public a thing which had been previously unavailable. Prior to the invention of Nautilus, if a member wanted to train hard, in a more elaborate way than Universal equipment permitted, he had to learn how to use barbells. Someone had to teach him this. Moreover, someone had to teach the heath spa staff how to teach him this. Such professional education was, and still is, time consuming and not widely available.

&gt; But with Nautilus equipment, a minimum-wage employee could be taught very quickly how to use the whole circuit, ostensibly providing a total-body workout with little invested in employee education. Furthermore, the entire circuit could be performed in about 30 minutes, thus decreasing member time on the exercise floor, increasing traffic capacity in the club, and maximizing sales exposure to more traffic. Nautilus equipment quite literally made the existence of
the modern health club possible.

&gt; The problem, of course, is that machine-based training did not work as it was advertised. It
was almost impossible to gain muscular bodyweight doing a circuit. People who were trying to do so would train faithfully for months without gaining any significant muscular weight at all. When they went to barbell training, a miraculous thing would happen: they would immediately gain — within a week — more weight than they had gained in the entire time they had fought with the 12-
station circuit.

&gt; The reason that isolated body-part training on machines doesn't work is the same reason that barbells work so well, better than any other tools we can use to gain strength. The human body functions as a complete system — it works that way, and it likes to be trained that way. It doesn't like to be separated into its constituent components and then have those components exercised separately, since the strength obtained from training will not be utilized in this way. The
general pattern of strength acquisition must be the same as that in which the strength will be used. The nervous system controls the muscles, and the relationship between them is referred to as ""neuromuscular."" When strength is acquired in ways that do not correspond to the patterns in which it is intended to actually be used, the neuromuscular aspects of training have not been considered. Neuromuscular specificity is an unfortunate reality, and exercise programs must respect this principle the same way they respect the Law of Gravity.

&gt; *[2nd Edition, STARTING STRENGTH: BASIC BARBELL TRAINING, Mark Rippetoe &amp; Lon Kilgore (2007)]*

I believe the gym for a large part is dishonest, and don't get me started on those bullshit trainers that ruin your gait which leads to the destruction of joints and atrophy of certain muscle groups (foot arch loses strength, achilles also).

&gt; We're used to a sedentary society so whenever someone regularly exercises people consider it ""extreme"", I resent this as it seems to say that those who are active are ""abnormal""...

I'm not conflating extremism with abnormality, but the tight meaning I gave in the footnote, and it should be obvious I'm not against exertion, far from it. However, many people literally go to the gym to run nowhere listening to their iPod—yes, that's outrageously abnormal. :)

&gt; Don't lump all car users in with those who are poor drivers...

All drivers cause harm whether good or bad: air pollution, and every car on the road increases the probability of collision. There's also the social and urban destruction. If you are not a car, the roads are unsafe by design. How many children play 6ft away from a 30mph road? The best driver in the world isn't going to avoid an errant pedestrian in some contexts. However, I'm doing some statistical analysis of how (poorly) drivers over take cyclists. I was testing my equipment and on the frist run out for a 4(!) minute whiz round the local street, I had 2 good, 3 bad, and 1 ugly (speeding, on a moblie...).

Also remember, less than 50% of the UK has a drivers license—many are too young, too old, too poor, too scared, or too disabled. The car represents a tyranny of a minority!

&gt; My car is a means to an end, I drive it responsibly and safely.

For some it is an end. Suburbs were a great way of promoting and extending car use, as was building low bridges to prevent the passage of buses.

&gt; You don't drive do you?

I could do, I choose not to, and that would make me a personal bike ""extremist"" (taking one idea and applying it everywhere). Bikes:

&gt; Would £150 cover a decade worth of inner tubes, ... ,

Yes, helmet, lights, etc, no maintenance, crude figure: 20£ per year. For some 70£ could mean disposable bikes, ride it till it is a bit naff donate to local bike coop. I don't undervalue my self, my commuter was 70£ and my sweet MTB was a magnitude more expensive. Gentle riding on a bike can mean almost zero wear and zero maintenance. I'm 12 months without a flat and I forgot how long ago I needed a new tyre. (Consider how often a car gets a flat or becomes threadbare.)

&gt; they're not currently conceivable solutions to the problems you wish to resolve

Yet you conceived at least one! It's only unconceivable if you are invested in an incumbent political party and economic ideology. A living wage along with good cycle infrastructure is totally doable. For 10 billion£ we dug a hole to France, every year we find 40billion to throw at the military. For just 4billion at a high-eye-balled price at 500k per mile we could have 8000 miles of track built each year. (It ranges from 10k-500k per mile.)

true,[deleted],null,null,"One of the special features for ""Doctor Who: The Movie"" was about the comics and I was excited because, well, Doctor Who comics. Then I did some looking online and saw that... either the comics strips and the comic books or the comic books and the novels didn't share the same continuity. I will dive into a fandom wholeheartedly, but not the parts I don't need, or contradict. Like how I don't bother with many Batman comics pre-1985. Which brings me to the ""Human Nature""/""Family of Blood"" two-parter. I think that's based off of a novel with the Seventh Doctor. That was probably the nail in the coffin for me and things outside of the show. With that said, I'll more than likely going to pick up the Radio Times adventure that comes out later this year.

I think Leela had to have died before the Time War, because that didn't happen until the Eighth/Ninth Doctor. Of course, the vagueness of how much time passes on Gallifrey during each visit means that Leela could've stayed minutes before the Time War broke out. Leela's in my top four. Jo's my number one because she had a real arc compared to most Companions. Compare her when she first meets the Third Doctor to when she leaves him. Not many Companions change over time. At least, not from the newer series. Rose, Jack, Martha, and Amy were pretty much the same. Rory changed a lot, and we already mentioned the tragedy of Donna.

I think my favorite Leela story was ""The Talons of Weng-Chiang"". But ""The Invisible Enemy"" did give me K9...

I wasn't much of a fan of The Rani, either, but I doubt she would've had anything to do with the Time War, so I need closure. I also liked her bickering with The Master. With that said, I'll take Romana over a billion-billion Rani. I don't do much what-if'ing because I end up disappointed and I think that's a problem a lot of fans have of things. They spend a lot of time with their theories and when they don't get what they want, they rebel. Still, I had an idea about Clara that I won't think much about. That she's a broken Time Lady, and that maybe she's Romana. Romana was in E-Space for a while, I wouldn't be surprised if that did things to her.

I didn't like much about the Fifth Doctor's company, save for Tegan when she came back, so I don't have much to say about Adric.

They can't - supporting the children of feckless people is the price for preventing the children of feckless people sleeping under bridges or starving to death.

You can taper the amount of income that is available, but if society does not pay for those children to exist with their parents then it will pay for them to exist in care (or leave them to fend for themselves).

A better question would be just how serious is the problem? Most of the UK's benefit spending goes on pensions, not child support (there's a visualisation [here](http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2013/jan/08/uk-benefit-welfare-spending), but pensions account for 47% of spending - child benefit is about 8%).

First, I think the change from playing in Brazil to England is a lot harder to manage than a European player coming from the French Ligue to the EPL, something numerous Brazilians have shown us over the years. So Oscar's got a +1 in my book there.

Second, Hazard came with a bigger price tag as well as much more fuss and pomp, he was supposed to be THE guy, but for my money, Oscar has added more to our side than Eden, especially when it comes to the big games. Oscar's performance in the CL alone puts him above Hazard for my money. 

That being said, I absolutely love both players, and Mata is still our best player.

It's not an issue of wages, as frankly, some of the low-skilled labour will never command high wages - but people need to stop being so sniffy about the work itself - both those in offices looking down on ""menial"" tasks, and those offered such work.

I totally agree. I am a scientist, a professional and generally looked upon as intelligent and skilled. I can clone a gene, but I cannot out up a shelf. ( well not with ease). So really who has the the better more useful skills? The builder, who can build extensions, mend roofs and put in kitchens or me with my wonky shelf.

true,hotcod,null,null,"&gt;It's like when people say ""the conservatives gave millionaires £100k/yr extra""

I've never heard any one say anything like that. I've heard people say they've given millionaires a tax cut *worth* a given amount which I guess you could get confusing if you are easily confused. 

&gt;I think the thing that makes it wrong IMO is the assumption that it is THEIR money to begin with. Giving somebody less money isn't a tax. It's a cut. If you were taking money away from people, that's a tax.

This is, as you say, a cut, just like adancedwithdragons was technically correct that it's not a tax (well there's actually an argument there but it's splitting hairs) but I ask you this... If the government gave them the money and then taxed it back (like some other benefits are taxed) would people be wrong to say that it was a cut to benefits based on the number of rooms people have? 

In this case I feel it's pretty much interchangeable and quibbling over the use of ""tax"" when *even the government is happy to use that term* is a pretty pointless debate to get in to and one that I think people are using to bump the actual debate off course. 

The only reason I've engaged with it here was it's the top comment and I'm honest interested why people *care* enough about that for that to be the case. ",0,1361226388,null,0,false,0,c8hg3gp,t3_18qroo,t1_c8hg3gp,t1_c8hduxu,null,1431333071,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3

The main problem is the increasing amount of government secured pensions, as in, government workers.

This is why a lot of councils are now opting to outsource a lot of their jobs to private companies. It costs them slightly more now to pay the workers, but they save millions in the future because it's up to the private company and not the government to pay the pension scheme.

If you take a look at a lot of government worker's pensions, they are ridiculously high compared to private sector workers. And not just because they have put in more money, either.

Each generation is robbing the young to pay the old, and it won't be long before this becomes unsustainable.

true,Dread_Knight,ukdotanet,Professional Indian,"Right! Feedback...This is my first LAN so bear with me. Definitely prefacing this with the LAN was incredible. Absolutely amazing, had so much fun, definitely looking forward to going again and I hope you guys support DotA 2 at future events. Just, so much AWESOME!

I'd honestly like to first say that I genuinely think that Judge shouldn't be a consideration for head admin of a tournament ever again. In addition to leaving Lapinou, there was just in general quite a lot of confusion about the event until Lapinou took over. Really, hats off to you man. I won't comment much on the dotatalk LAN, I was pretty disappointed in what happened at dotatalk but I wasn't there so I'll leave it at that.

The tech issues...Well, honestly, after trying really hard for the best part of the day with Rabbit to assist the tech guys (Murray &lt;3) I'm actually a lot more sympathetic than everyone else seems to be. Granted, we were the only tournament to require internet access, and they really were trying to give us priority, it's not like they were just sat there doing nothing. The system they had was pretty nice but it just came down to the fact that people were just abusing the internet, I overhead quite a few people had left torrents on and stuff like that which isn't really something you should ever have to consider at a LAN event, people should be more helpful than that. They were meant to have BT infinity but it sounds like BT really fucked them, was a shame and nothing more. Personally, I'm actually really happy with how they handled the situation, they had us on top priority to fix and when I asked for the pretty cheeky request of the 2 lines entirely for us they were really happy to oblige. It would have been nice if we got it done earlier because obviously it knocked onto the scheduling for the rest of the tournament but I wouldn't complain about it personally. I think they also handled reason's PC problem pretty well, I know how it feels to have a backup die on you but glad it got fixed sharpishly.

The initial format I actually really liked, and was happy with the decision to carry on with the two games per team honestly. The idea at heart was good and I know it went on for a long time but I guess we were stuck in with it by the time it looked like it might go on a bit too late. I think that by the time we realised it was going to take us until like 1:30 AM+ we couldn't really stop all the games. Managed to reschedule Reason vs eNigma for 10:00 tommorow morning, so the flexibility was appreciated. 

Would have seriously liked information about the format, start times and stuff like that before hand. I assume it was down to judge but really, trying to organise taking down a lot of gear was such a hassle because of it, was really pretty ridiculous, if I have any criticism a start time was what i really wanted, doesn't matter if it ended being wrong and we didn't start for a while, but some sort of concrete start time would have been amazing, 4 o'clock Friday was pretty crazy but I could have met that deadline if I had to. Eventually I got some clarity on the situation that it was starting for sure early Saturday, but it was really too late. Can't emphasise how much of an issue this really was for me. This might have been Judge's fault but even if it was, someone should have hit him over the head for it.

I'd like to echo what will said about the prize scheme though, I'm not privy to everything but like, I would have liked to see a better prize structure, something for 3rd was definitely needed, I know it was 6 teams but that's just what I think.

Onto more positive stuff! Food was really good, pretty reasonably priced and SO glad you offered a good breakfast, sorted out the hilarious fork issues pretty quickly so props to you guys there. One game that should have been casted though was eNigma vs Microwave Chicken. Was a long game in comparison to a lot of other teams vs Microwave Chicken as is eNigma standard but the catering staff left cheats on and they spawned a sharper knife for us so we took the win pretty convincingly as the string that was really holding team Microwave Chicken together fell apart as we subbed in the new knife player. Needless to say some drama was had with the plastic knife but that's internal drama and we'd rather not comment on it.

Really loved the venue, was perfect, I heard you can rent out the huge hall next door which will be awesome when (yes, when) this event gets bigger! I REALLY loved the room we were in, some people had problems with the CS and COD4 players there noise wise, which granted, was sort of a problem, but nothing that better headsets and microphones can't sort out! Personally though I thought it was incredible, I could just sit back and watch people playing next to me, mill around the room and watch some absolutely incredible FPS plays. I wouldn't change it personally, but I understand where people are coming from I guess noise wise. Hopefully next time there are a few more DotA teams there so we can have more of the row to ourselves, Dingleberry &amp; Reason should attest to how incredible it was to play right next to your opponents. So much fun!

The most serious issues of all though was that your voodoo protection was a bit easy to crack through. Only took me like a minute and a half to curse will, pretty ridiculous given you guys are a big lan. ( &lt;3 )

Gonna end I guess by saying that once again, I loved your LAN, I really hope you do more DotA in the future, unfortunately I might not be able toa ttend epic11 due to other time constraints but I would REALLY love to go again and definitely plan to.",0,1361231656,null,0,1361232475,0,c8hhqnp,t3_18pyxq,t1_c8hhqnp,t3_18pyxq,null,1431333855,5,false,UKDota,t5_2uyoj,5

- Alexandra Palace - evening trip - you get a very good view across London.  Bonus if there is something going on there.  Failing that - definitely go up Primrose Hill in the evening - take a bottle, picnic and friends if its semi-warm out.  This is the view from atop primrose hill from Timeout magazine AFAIK - http://www.toimg.net/managed/images/10131911/w482/h298/image.jpg

- Usual touristy stuff - Tower of London, London Eye, Westminster, Buckingham Palace, Selfridges, Harrods, Regent Street, Leicester Sq, Covent Garden, Picadilly Circus, Greenwich, Kew Gardens, Hampstead Heath, Natural History Museum, Tate Modern, National Portrait gallery, British Museum, see something at the Barbican/Royal Albert Hall/Southbank centre/West End, Take a Boris Bike around a ride of Hyde Park, Portobello Road Market, Notting Hill

- Interesting but more peculiar - Neasden Temple (http://www.mandir.org/visitorinfo/index.htm) is well worth a visit.  Get a river ferry from the center to the O2 Millenium Dome - very nice in the evening, but wrap up warm!  Southwark cathedral is nice and has a food market just outside.  Little Venice is also worth a wander around if you're going through that way - as a passing through way - one of my nices memories was taking the long way home and strolling through on a sunny evening.


Outside of London - a big shoutout for Kenilworth castle - built from sandstone and it was so powerful that they had to destroy parts of it in the civil war, to prevent it being used as a base again - since its not as preserved as Warwick castle, it is cheaper and also off the beaten track.

Chatsworth House and Hardwick Hall are both excellent -Chatsworth is the typical Jane Austin type of country house - and very grand.  Hardwick hall is immortalised in the rhyme ""Hardwick Hall, More Glass than Wall"" - the number of windows is impressive considering when it was built!  Blenheim is also an excellent day out.

If you have access to a car - Kinderscout is worth a day trip to walk up - very nice and you get a bit of the flavour of the peaks from it.

Would you also ask whichever Unionist politicians are there where they see the flag protests going? Also ask them if they feel the rather right wing stance of the DUP and UUP alienates a lot of voters. 

And ask the Unionists why they want union, but do not want the extension of the Abortion act to Northern Ireland. I expect the DUP MLA will answer something about abortion being murder and that, as a Christian, they must oppose it. If they do answer like that I think you could put them in a tight spot by asking why, as they're making what they regard as the murder of unborn people the centre of their outlook, they want union with a country (Britain) which has a law legalising mass murder, and not union with a country (RoI) which has a strict ban on abortion.
