So a 3 bedroom house 2 bathrooms a kitchen and a garden is worth the same as it would cost to build the same house from scratch.
It would normalise the cost of good quality housing and do away with the insane situation we have in London where a broom cupboard goes for £300,000. 

Asking bankers and property speculators just 'stop being greedy' is about as much use as an air conditioned igloo.

Anyway, some ground rules.  Bump into someone, or someone bumps into you, it's almost expected that you both say Sorry even if it wasn't your fault.  Its a natural reflex for me that I sometimes say it to dogs or inanimate objects.


And whenever someone you don't know asks you how you're doing the response expected is ""Fine thanks,  You?"" even if you feel shitty.  If you're with British friends, then you can go on about how terrible your day is or whatnot.



To your question about in stores when they try and talk about other stuff, some people (especially the elder retail workers) will try and make genuine small talk, other retail workers will make ""company small talk"" it's where the company things it's a good rule to engage the customers regardless of if you want to or not.  You can usually tell by the facial expression/eyes or tone on who is engaged or just faking it.



Anyway, enjoy your stay, it's hard fitting into other cultures but if you're down south (excluding wales) you'll find that most people operate on a ""I like my personal space and if you enter it i'll stab you"", so interaction will be minimal unless you're a regular.

I'd fucking love to megabus up and say hello. God dammit if I don't make this one I'll make the next. Disclaier the following shit was done live. I don't have much to offer the worls but this was a literal lifyt of one of my live bits. usic should always be live. if possible.

true,brettvirmalo,crest,KONE|2015,"&gt; While I don't see a lot of them fitting in as a primary crest

I agree. I think one place where the club has missed the point is that an entire new design program is the right thing to be shooting for, not just a new crest. Though not a fan of the design solution, [I think Wolves got this point right](http://www.designweek.co.uk/news/wolverhampton-wanderers-rolls-out-new-branding/3035527.article) - the eyes under the stairs is brilliant.

Some thoughts on the ones you mention. If you can elaborate on what you like about them that would be very helpful.

&gt; 15 - C/D

I agree that these have potential. I need to do a bunch more sketches in these two styles to see what type of variations might push them forward. Not sure if the wreaths on either side is too common a solution (in football crests and beyond). The complex negative space in the wreath one may also be seen as problematic by the club (they want ""simplicity"").

&gt; All of Row 24

These were some of the first solutions I thought of. Use the old tower and turn the fence/sash thing into a ribbon. They to have a distinct shape (I like the idea of getting away from circles and shields) ala Spurs (tall and thin). I do think, however, that a ""more authentic"" representation of Prince Rupert's Tower is important to the club (not so tall, a bit fatter), so I think that is a the killer on these.

&gt; 22 - A

Pretty much a response to my above note. OK, no tall tower? Then I just ribbon around the short fat one. I am leaning toward getting away from ribbons, however (too old-fashioned, tend to be a bit overly complex). At least this ribbon is pretty simple.",0,1379105185,null,0,false,0,cc7shb1,t3_1mbtwr,t1_cc7shb1,t1_cc7ret7,null,1429473946,5,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,5

When I said C/D, I only meant because it kinda sits in between that column.  The design is the one with the wreath.  Has a historic feel with the wreath (also a sign of victory), has the tower which is a clear indicator of Everton, the inception year (which I find important), and the motto.  Instantly recognizeable as us.  

* All of Row 24  (Specifically C, the third from the left)

I don't feel we need the team name spelled out, honestly.  Everyone knows that tower as the Toffees.  More of a throwback to the EFC style days would be a better fit.  The three bands would say, in my mind - Top: *1878*    Middle: *EFC*    Bottom: *NSNO*    That way it's minimal letters, not too crowded (as I felt the previous crest was with the motto written out), and yet all aspects flow together.  

* 22 - A 

All the previous mentions listed above.  Simple, yet elegant &amp; distinct.  

**EDIT:**  [Here](http://myevertonnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/BLQmTa_CcAEmLXA.png) is one of the designs I have found online that, to me, is what should be the foundation of crest (or a close resemblance to it).  Has everything that makes the Everton crest noteworthy, minus the NSNO, but chat could be incorporated at the top between the tips of the wreath.

true,stormgirl,null,null,"&gt; early studies have shown wildly different results from Scandinavia, particularly when it comes to the teaching itself.

Definitely hasn't been our experience. Our pilot scheme was extremely positive, for those settings that didn't have suitable outdoor space we have helped them link up with local green spaces, we helped establish fundraising (waitrose has been awesome!) for proper wet weather gear &amp; most of our (23 last count) settings are now running at least weekly forest school sessions. If people are genuinely interested in supporting children's learning &amp; are provided with adequate gear &amp; equipment they are generally happy to be outdoors. 

&gt;basic communication issues at school-entering age are something that are a massive problem that are being talked about in Education research. 

Absolutely- but communication &amp; social skills are not effectively taught via a passive approach i.e formally/sit down &amp; listen. To really learn how to interact with others &amp; develop language comprehension and vocabulary you need to be exposed to a wide variety of people, places &amp; things. 

Logic tells us that having a greater choice of activities (i.e play) provides more of this in comparison to sitting at a desk listening to a teacher. Research backs this up. As for literacy &amp; numeracy skils- they can still be taught in this way. 

Let's consider a 4 year old child with limited language skill. He has shown little interest or understanding with maths/literacy. 
If we sit that child at a desk- repeating the ABCs, worksheets, flash cards, perhaps he might learn some of these things by rote. But that is superficial-not a genuine understanding of letter sounds, it does not provide him with an ability to decode words independently &amp; it sure as hell does not help him make friends or communicate his needs and interests to others. He might understand a very small % of what is happening at any given time, because the teacher is having to teach to the whole group and cannot give him the attention he needs. 

Let's compare that to the play based approach: Because the children are free to move &amp; choose the teachers/staff can observe &amp; look for small group 1:1 teachable moments. His teachers might observe that he likes cars. They might make road signs and maps with him, They will work gradually- observing, planning, evaluating. Inviting friends to join his play, building on his play- adding words, role modelling and repeating language, giving him positive verbal feedback &amp; repetition. They might focus on high frequency words initially- easy to see how his interests in cars might lead to scenarios of counting, measuring, writing, interaction. Responsive to his interests &amp; individual needs. Still teaching the basics. Still covering the same curriculum but in a more relevant way.

For another child- it might be dinosaurs, for another it might be music. 
The point is we are not all the same- so to expect very young children to be on the same schedule, learning the exact same things, in the same way is unreasonable, unnecessary &amp; often- counter productive.

Yes, this student would not ordinarily pay council tax. If he was in a tenancy full of other students, none of them would be required to pay. He has however **opted** to live with a working professional. It was his choice to do so therefore as long as part of the tenancy signed agrees to the sharing of bills, he should pay 50% of whatever the council tax bill for the property becomes. If he didn't wish to be liable for such bills, he should not have chosen to live with a working professional.

Likewise, he was not expecting to pay council tax. So it all depends on what was determined prior to tenancy agreement.

When you signed your tenancy with the LL you were expecting to pay 50% of bills, and this is a breach of such agreement. If your LL is not amenable, threaten to move out and prepare to actually do so. If the tenant is not willing to pay the remainder of the CT bill then your LL should.

HOWEVER, when I have moved into existing flat shares (as a student) with working adults it has usually been an upfront agreement to contribute towards council tax... for example, he would pay 25% (i.e. the ""other persons"" half... all be it discounted) and you would pay 50% as you currently do.

I think if you are hoping to have him pay 37.5% and you pay 37.5% of the bill (due to the discount) that is incredibly wishful thinking. Legally he doesn't have to pay anything, and on most properties in the south that would be tantamount to asking him to gift you about £400-700 over a year.... however much he likes you or the property if he agrees to that he's either stupid or being mislead.

That is *exactly* what the law is doing: 'the alleged victim matters, you, the accused, do not.'

&gt; It's what the public may have done and that is wrong but to use your own point this is not the responsibility of the law.

You cannot compare protecting someone's feelings to protecting someone's life.

The law, and our society which is behind the law, has a responsibility not to *create* victims. To reveal someone's identity, knowing the likely consequences, is wrong.

Withholding the identity of both allows due process to take place unencumbered by external influences. Which is what the law should always seek to achieve.

If victims need help to come forward then this should be done without creating new victims. If those on your side of the argument were intent on finding out what it is that prevents victims from coming forward in the first place -- police attitudes perhaps? -- and then putting in place systems to mitigate or remove these obstacles, I would be fully in support.

The first precept of medicine is 'first, do no harm'. A good principle for all, including the law.

As estanmilko pointed out, copyright infringement isn't theft. 

But let's go along with that analogy. If you stole something from a shop, you might be punished. But you'd be entitled to a fair trial, with the presumption of innocence. Under the Digital Economy Act, you get no fair trial: if the copyright industry says you're guilty, you could have your internet connection cut off at their say-so, without any trial and without presumption of innocence.

If you are found guilty of theft, you might go to prison.

You said it yourself. It was 24 years too late. Their apology is nothing but empty words.

&gt; I was vastly misinterpreted on this thread, but ok.

We all know what point you were trying to make; you weren't misinterpreted. You're just wrong. Simply because none of us agree with you, it doesn't mean we all misinterpreted. It just means you're wrong.

The worst part is your username. I know you claim you understand what it's all about but you obviously don't. It's not just Liverpool fans who don't read the S*n anymore, Everton fans don't either. It's a **citywide** boycott, not specifically an LFC one. It's not just the article they wrote in 1989, it was the disdain they showed against the victims, the family, the city as a whole, and their attitude regarding the city in the aftermath. They never offered a hint of an apology or detraction for years. The S*n will always be scum in Liverpool, and amongst its non-Scouse fans. It doesn't matter that they've changed editors and writers countless times since then. Each and every generation of S*n employees and management had the chance to retract that article, but not a single one did until over 2 decades later. At that point, it was way too late.",0,1379125609,null,0,false,0,cc7yqzz,t3_1mc83s,t1_cc7yqzz,t1_cc7yh6s,null,1429470400,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7
true,Technonorm,eng-Cheshire,Cheshire,"Anywhere south of the river is nice. Stockton heath is really good for a quiet night out with a good meal.

Trafficwise, beware of bridge foot island. Its the roundabout in the centre that straddles the Mersey and pretty much all traffic has to go through it. Its gridlock at rush hour. 

Shopping is good. You have golden square in the town centre which is indoors and has your usual range. Plenty of supermarkets (it has 3 asda stores In town...3!!! and a massive tesco next to the stadium). There's also the alban retail park and Europa boulevard retail park where you'll find IKEA. 

Plenty of leisure activities. Cinema is off Cromwell avenue in Westbrook (Northwest Warrington) and there's bowling off winwick road (a49 main road that runs north right through the town). Orford park (again off winwick road) has been redeveloped and has plenty of sports facilities. There's also Gulliver's world in old hall (same area as Westbrook). Its seen better days, but is good if you have kids. 

As has been mentioned, traffic links are very good. Mainline trains at bank quay station, and local/Manchester trains from Warrington central. M6, m56 and m62 in easy reach as well. 

Lymm is very nice to visit (used to live there). Check their website for events. There's always some sort of festival on there and there are some lovely pubs and restaurants. 

All in all, you should enjoy being there. Stay away from the rough estates and you'll be fine. It doesn't deserve the abuse it sometimes receives. Its a town that's actively regenerating and actually has a pulse. All the opinion of a rural Cheshire lad of course, but I liked living there. Feel free to ask any questions!

true,ithinktherefore,num1-away,,"**tl;dr: Jewish Spurs supporter here. Disagree with the FA, disagree with Baddiel, proud of the reason Tottenham fans are called Yids. But still feel a bit wary of ""mascot-ism."" Here's some quotes I liked.**

Aight, so first of all, I feel obligated to point out the irony that I'm posting this on Yom Kippur (not fasting this year — I'll be watching tomorrow morning at the pub).

Second of all, to add some context, I'm a Jewish New Yorker who spent a year living in Britain (Scotland, but I spent a good bit of time in London and made it to the Lane a couple of times).

To state my position frankly — I support Spurs fans identity as Yids, I support the use of the term, and I disagree wholeheartedly with the specifics and the general misguided direction of the FA's ruling. It's a silly little smoke and mirrors effect that lets them claim they're tackling racism in football, without actually addressing the tougher issues.

That said, I completely empathize and agree with Wolfe's double-mindedness on the issue. I'm sure there are some other Jewish Yids (heh) on here, from London and otherwise, who have opinions on this, I'd be curious to hear some of them.

Here are a few specific passages from Wolfe's article that perfectly encapsulate how I feel about the Yid issue:

&gt;It was, and may still be, a glorious act of the many protecting the few. It is people changing their Facebook profiles to photos of black hoodies following the injustice of Trayvon Martin’s shooting. It is, as Jonathan Gelberg a Tottenham supporter living in Israel said, “nothing short of heroic.”

.

&gt;And yet, is that what’s going through the heads of a stand full of fans singing: “Yiddo! Jermaine Defoe, he’s a Yiddo!” Or are they, as has been suggested, simply enacting a tribal identity? We are Tottenham, Tottenham supporters are “Yids” therefor… “Yiddo!”

.

&gt;I’m often asked whether I, an American, support Tottenham because they are the “Jewish” club and my response is always no. [This drives me fucking crazy]

.

&gt;My feeling when watching Ajax supporters sing “Hava Nagila” is that it is a form of black face.

.

&gt;It’s this collective identification that I’m uncomfortable with. It’s this that smacks of mascot-ism. It’s this that diminishes the truth of how horrible anti-Semitism really feels. When West Ham fans make hissing sounds to simulate the gas chambers, and Spurs fans respond by chanting “Yid Army!” does the average fan think of the horror and pain of knowing that if only your entire family hadn’t stayed in Poland you might have cousins, and aunts and uncles, and family reunions? Or do they simply think, “oh man, they’re making fun of my team.”

.

&gt;If you sing “Yid” because no one in the world has the right to be racist and anti-Semitic, and you believe in standing in solidarity with minorities being attacked, then by all means I stand alongside you.

.

&gt;**I find the FA and Baddiel’s argument repugnant...It is the linguistic version of saying women shouldn’t wear skirts because men won’t be able to help themselves from raping them. Or that Egyptians shouldn’t wear headdresses because it will incite attacks against Arabs...In other words, racism wouldn’t exist if people stopped being proud of their heritage. Or, anti-Semitic morons wouldn’t exist in England if Tottenham supporters stopped calling themselves “Yids.” This is the worst kind of blaming the victims that there is.**

.


&gt;But my fellow supporters, I beg you to look within. I humbly ask you to think about it when you sing “Yid Army.” Are you protecting me? Are you standing with me in solidarity? Are you defending the minorities against the majority as was so nobly done in the past? Or are you turning me into a little doll that you wave about with little or no care to who I really am?",0,1379128165,null,0,1379128456,0,cc7zgo8,t3_1mc8vm,t1_cc7zgo8,t3_1mc8vm,null,1429470067,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

Some people love Eccleston. others Tennent, other Smith.  Some love all while some love one and hate the others.

The same goes for the companions.   Some people feel that Rose is by far the best, while others favor Donna, (Craig!), Amy, Clara or Martha.   Some (like me) love them all for different reasons.

One of the great things about Doctor Who is that it is a show that is constantly in flux.   The Doctor/Companion mix is always being shaken up and changed.   If you don't like the current combination, you can be assured that it will change soon enough.   (That's both a blessing and a curse).

There are outstanding episodes in every season, and there are many posts regarding the ""best"" episodes.  I always recommend starting (new Who) with season 1, so you get a better idea and appreciation for the character.    Aside from the storyline, knowing the previous incarnations of the Doctor, gives you greater appreciation for the current manifestation.",0,1379130823,null,0,false,0,cc8079t,t3_1mcvks,t1_cc8079t,t3_1mcvks,null,1429469648,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

&gt;an Anglo-Saxon immigration event affecting 50–100% of the Central English male gene pool at that time is required. We note, however, that our data do not allow us to distinguish an event that simply added to the indigenous Central English male gene pool from one where indigenous males were displaced elsewhere or one where indigenous males were reduced in number … This study shows that the Welsh border was more of a genetic barrier to Anglo-Saxon Y chromosome gene flow than the North Sea

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Someone who has never earnt, and never paid tax, is equally entitled to benefits, it's not a pay in then take out system.

That's your personal point of view. And the government disagrees with you in respect to pensions - you have to work 10 years to qualify for a full pension. I also wonder how you feel about immigrants having full access to benefits without working. And finally sustainability - if we give *everybody* benefits without some form of penalty what is to stop *everyone* claiming? You must take into consideration the reality of the whole system - that funding must come from somewhere - that you want to encourage work and discourage laziness (carrots and sticks everywhere). Some left-wing ideal isn't going to put food on the table.

&gt;  ""You are taxed on your ""excess income"", the tax we have is a tax on earning not on being a citizen.""
&gt;
&gt; Secondly the question of whether people ""can"" work is another bad question to ask.

You don't even bother taking into account the expenses an individual like myself might incur travelling to a location that has jobs. The loss of friends, the racial abuse from the locals, having to build up a new life. Who are you to think hard working individuals have ""excess income""? That income might be what afforded an individual to work in a particular job in the first place. And then what about the non-monetary benefits? A worker doesn't have free time. Perhaps they are getting less sex. Try putting a value on free time and sex! Then let's see what your idea of a fiat currency is.

&gt; The system is built so that the bottom functioning 10% are always going to struggle regardless of whether they classify as ""deserving"" in some fashion.

Oh God. It's ""the man"" and ""conspiracy theories"" gone wild. There should be a porn subreddit for loony lefties like this who fantasise that the world is being controlled by one man.

&gt; Right wingers somehow believe that if we take away the ""undeservers"" most minimal level of benefits they'll not only find work, but they'll innovate whole new sections of the economy that will provide the extra jobs need to employ them.

Clearly you will get complete failures in life. Those who ""don't get it"". Those who will not get a job at McDonalds when there's nothing else available because they are ""above"" it. But nobody is ""above"" anything. Not when you compare our lives to those in Africa or China.

Secondly it comes down to the cultural values of a society. Britain, unfortunately, has many people like you - an inflated sense of self-entitlement. You honestly believe you are owed something! From me, from DevilishRogue, from anyone that doesn't subscribe to your Marxist views. And you go around spewing hatred! That's not positive for the economy or culture! Instead of trying to help the bottom of society to change for the better you just want to give them more and say ""there, there, you deserve it!""

That's where all of the people who initially helped bring the show back into popularity started, and look how much they enjoyed it!

That being said, you're right - Season 5 had a new head writer, new Doctor, new companion, fresh start.  If, personality-wise, you feel the person you are trying to brainwash might connect better with Eleven or Amy, then go for that.  

Both of those points aside, I have a method which currently has a 100% success rate of brainwashing people into Whovians (over a dozen friends!), including those who claim not to like sci-fi.  

Start them on Season 3 ""Blink"".  This is a great introduction episode because it doesn't require you to know anything about the show, while making you want answers to a lot of questions.  Who is that Doctor guy?  If those statues are aliens... could anything or anyone else be an alien?  Who is that girl he's with?  What happened to Sally?  It's also good because you understand right away that there are consequences for being associated with the Doctor.  The whole episode has a great vibe, good soundtrack and a good story.  Plus by the end, your person is pretty creeped out.  

Then, immediately after watching Blink, you go to Season 3 ""Shakespeare Code"".  The comedic elements of this episode diffuse the scary factor from the Blink episode.  It has another very strong non-companion in Shakespeare, while allowing you to get to know Martha a bit, get interested in the companion/Doctor dynamic all the while feeling just as bewildered and confused about the Doctor as Martha is.  There are lots of hints about him being troubled and upset (references to Rose) all the while Tennant does that great broody-brilliant thing he's so good at.  It's a clever episode, and gets you interested in ""what's really going on with that Doctor guy"", plus the fun pop culture references.

true,kingofeggsandwiches,null,null,"You have given a simplistic and senseless narrative that is nothing but your interpretation of what you think the world is. A false narrative born out of  a lack of comprehension over the true complexity of the questions at hand.

&gt;That's your personal point of view. And the government disagrees with you in respect to pensions - you have to work 10 years to qualify for a full pension. I also wonder how you feel about immigrants having full access to benefits without working. And finally sustainability - if we give everybody benefits without some form of penalty what is to stop everyone claiming? You must take into consideration the reality of the whole system - that funding must come from somewhere - that you want to encourage work and discourage laziness (carrots and sticks everywhere). Some left-wing ideal isn't going to put food on the table.

This isn't up for debate, pensions are a separate matter and immigration is certainly a different matter I don't want to touch on. Who said anything about giving *everybody* benefit. What is it with you people and an inability to deal with modal functions. People don't willingly choose JSA over working because it's a horrible way to live, the people who stay on it for a long time either have another form of income or are socially dysfunction. Of course this social dysfunction is entirely their own fault given that it doesn't constitute a disability. (I'll also add that ""putting food on the table"" is a completely inappropriate analogy to use, it's exactly such analogies identifying economics with personal finance that lead people like yourself down blind alleys such as blaming the poor, they are not at all equivalent.). It's going to do absolutely nothing for the economy by forcing the tiny % of these people into work that would do were JSA removed.

&gt;You don't even bother taking into account the expenses an individual like myself might incur travelling to a location that has jobs. The loss of friends, the racial abuse from the locals, having to build up a new life. Who are you to think hard working individuals have ""excess income""? That income might be what afforded an individual to work in a particular job in the first place. And then what about the non-monetary benefits? A worker doesn't have free time. Perhaps they are getting less sex. Try putting a value on free time and sex! Then let's see what your idea of a fiat currency is.

Wow this is completely irrelevant. Tax works by only deducting from your earnings over a certain threshold, in this sense it is excess, it is owed the moment it is earnt. 

&gt;Oh God. It's ""the man"" and ""conspiracy theories"" gone wild. There should be a porn subreddit for loony lefties like this who fantasise that the world is being controlled by one man.

Where pray tell did you get this lunatic notion. Saying ""the system is built"" means nothing more than ""the system is set up in a way so that"", I at no point implied any one individual or group were responsible or that this state of affairs, or that it wasn't arrived at naturally.

&gt;Clearly you will get complete failures in life. Those who ""don't get it"". Those who will not get a job at McDonalds when there's nothing else available because they are ""above"" it. But nobody is ""above"" anything. Not when you compare our lives to those in Africa or China. 

I'm actually ok off thanks, not from wasting my time with minimum wage, zero hours wage slavery thankfully.

&gt;Secondly it comes down to the cultural values of a society. Britain, unfortunately, has many people like you - an inflated sense of self-entitlement. You honestly believe you are owed something! From me, from DevilishRogue, from anyone that doesn't subscribe to your Marxist views. And you go around spewing hatred! That's not positive for the economy or culture! Instead of trying to help the bottom of society to change for the better you just want to give them more and say ""there, there, you deserve it!"" No they don't deserve it, and that's where your brain is broken. Broken brained Britains.

Just shut up. Everything you've said is so stupid and imaginary I can't even... How pathetic of you to believe that the labour of a few jobseeking individuals who would be looking at minimal wage anyway makes this great difference to the economy. Shut up because you don't have clue about economics, you treat it like religion where you think you can appease the economic gods by enforcing austerity, you think that if ordinary people were different we wouldn't be in this economic situation. You are the definition of a sucker. It's just childish scapegoating, you don't understand the questions at hand, you truly believe that if the average Brit changes their attitude it's going to make everyone richer. You actually blame people that make next to no difference to the economy while the toffs laugh and shit all over you as they all got their money out and into gold way before the crisis.

Then again it's only natural, in ancient times when food was short it was logical to blame and ostrachise the less productive in society,  and this is why it's so easy for people to pluck your strings. They are appealing to your underlying psychological mechanisms. What is for you ""common sense"" is actually just oversimplified trivialised lies, people fucking love sophistries because they reduce things down to things they can understand, they can't understand the economy, but they can can understand a meal table where everyone is eating but some people aren't paying. In the 21st century it doesn't work like you imagine. JSA for example costs the government 5-6 billion a year, while tax evasion and financial mismanagement has lost us the equivalent of hundreds of billions, but yeah keep picking on the little people I'm sure that at best 1 billion per year saving (+ the expense of implementing it) will bring those hundreds of billions back...",0,1379146017,null,0,1379149511,0,cc836xn,t3_1m98ay,t1_cc836xn,t1_cc82gyw,null,1429468254,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I'm not sure if you've noticed but there aren't thousands upon thousands of recording studios across the country feeding hard working sound engineers. The majority of the money from music goes straight back into the record companies holding the copyrights, with a small scrap of it conceded as royalties to the contributing artists and a pittance paid to the people that help piece that music together in the studio.

In the modern age where physical copies of music aren't needed and where virtually all the functionality of a studio can be reproduced on a home computer, record companies have no place taking such a huge cut of a musician's work.

Clearly never applied for planning permission to build a property.

The housing shortage, and hence house price bubble is a direct product of the lack of planning permission granted.

I have a suspicion that if government stopped thinking only terms of large scale developments (i.e. only being interested in granting permission for 20 houses, with 10% being 'affordable', whatever the fuck that means), and let people build their dream homes, then things would start to get better.

Drive through the country, and have a look at single cottages on hills -- think ""oh isn't that pretty, must be nice to live there"", then ask yourself if any council would grant permission for that today.

The UK is 90% undeveloped.  Building some additional properties in villages and on hills would not destroy the greenbelt.

Then there are the city and town outskirts; all the new developments are these horrid little identikit estates, with the tiniest houses the developers can get away with (got to cram in that extra house in the given area).

&gt; That's why he had to go.

Dropping either Weimann or Gabby (or moving one back into an actual midfield role) so we can play two up front seems silly, considering how well the front three system has worked for us. If Lambo goes with Sylla and Delph alongside Westwood in midfield, I expect changes will be made later in the game if we're not ahead.

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"Avoiding tax is, by definition, legal.

Avoiding tax is your duty.  Why?  Because if you aren't using a particular loop hole, somebody else is and you're paying their tax.

If a significant number of people aren't using loop holes, then there is no incentive for a government to close that loop hole.  Assuming it should be closed. If it's a perfectly reasonable ""loop hole"", then there is no problem using it.

My views on taxation is that we should be moving (note: ""_move_"" implying your tax bill would remain broadly the same if you are an average tax payer) strongly away from taxes on output/transactions and on to land-value based taxes.  There is a reason that a third of land is not registered by wealthy aristocratic estates: they don't want to pay tax on it; and they know full well that avoiding that tax is nigh on impossible -- you can't hide land in an offshore account.

true,jimicus,eng-somerset,"Where your aunt, your sister and your mum are the same person.","It's a complicated, fucked up situation, but largely of the industry's own making.

Back when Thatcher was in power, most of the nation's pubs were owned by breweries. Thatcher decided that this was effectively a vertical monopoly on manufacture and distribution, and introduced legislation to ban it - effectively forcing breweries to sell most of their pubs.

Enter the pub company. Today, most of the country's pubs - those that aren't chains - are owned by one of a couple of pub companies - Punch Taverns and Enterprise Inns. Your landlord doesn't own it, he rents it from them. And the terms they impose are usually so terrible that it's a wonder anyone takes on a pub at all.

These terms usually include: 

 - You will buy all your drinks from us. (Oh, by the way, our wholesale price is about 20-30% above the going rate for a barrel of beer. But you won't figure that out until long after the ink's dry on the contract).
 - Your rent will increase with your profits - so much so that it's pretty much impossible to make a good profit without sending most of it to us.
 - We trust you about as far as we can throw you. We'll install monitoring equipment on your lines to ensure you aren't selling more beer to the general public than you're buying from us. How this monitoring equipment works is a secret, but one thing is certain: we trust it a hell of a lot more than we trust you. So if it tells us you've sold fifty barrels in the last week but you only bought one - you're in breach of your contract. Oh, you genuinely only did sell one barrel and it's been a tough week? Tough. We don't believe you.
 - We can throw you out at any time and for any reason - or no reason at all - with zero notice. 
 - You want to make improvements, that's fine, but you make them at your expense. What do you mean, you can't afford to make improvements because we're taking all your profits? Running the business properly is your problem, not ours.
 - You've got no idea how to run a pub as a profitable business? Doesn't bother us. No we won't organise training, we won't provide a mentor, we won't even send you a leaflet. If you can't make it work yourself, we'll simply take the pub back and sell it to some other poor sod.

They can get away with this partly because it's a business-to-business contract and there's very little in law to stop a business signing a blatantly one-sided contract and partly because so many people have a romantic dream of running their own pub.

This is why so many neighbourhood pubs are closing left and right, and the ones that remain haven't seen a lick of paint in twenty years and are being propped up by a couple of elderly alcoholics.

I did not know about Megabus and thank you for that because it seems like a very useful thing to know, I will certainly use it in the future. 

Unfortunately in this case I didn't find what I was looking for: the cheapest would be a direct route but latest bus returning from Oxford is at 21:45 and with the lecture starting at 7 I would have to either walk out in the middle or miss the coach. The indirect route you suggested would be good for going up to oxford but on my way back I would have to spend like 5 hours in London waiting for a coach for Bournemouth (because the latest is at 9 and than at 5:30 in the morning) which I don't think is a good idea and it would still be near 40 pounds for the whole trip (which is much better than the 90 pounds offers I found until now but stil a bit too expensive for me).

So lets do the math then....

£50k Divided by minimum wage (6.31) = 7923 hours divide by 52 weeks = 152 hours a week divide by 7 = 21.76 hours per day...

So unless she is eating sleeping and shitting in 2hours 15 mins daily someone is talking shit..

gonna go with the politician in this case.....

As this is your first ever official wage, I can't imagine they'll deduct anything (a few pence, maybe). You can earn up to £10,000 before you are taxed.

Once you get your NINO card, bring it into where you worked and they'll let payroll know, who will then put you on the system to pay you.

What you should be prepared for though is the fact that there is always cut off days for payroll, meaning that for example, if you get paid monthly then they'll process the payments on the 18th and people then get paid on the 24th. If you'd worked after the 18th then you'll get paid the following month.

National Insurance is a tax you pay to build up an entitlement to a state pension and certain other benefits.  Your National Insurance number is a code of two letters, six numbers, and another letter, which follows you around throughout your working life and makes sure your tax and National Insurance contributions are only recorded against you, and not, for example, somebody else with the same name.

It seems a bit of a silly thing to have to wait for, as if you're only earning exactly £150, your National Insurance contributions for that week will equal a grand total of 12p, but it's still 12p that has to be paid, I'm afraid.

true,chamber37,,Joe le Tactics,"It seems counter attacking because we play fairly compact (like every 4-3-3 pretty much has to) and focus on winning the ball in midfield rather than retaining it. The system itself isn't necessarily counter attacking though. In pre-season we were more territorially dominant (against weaker teams, at least).

As for Weimann and Agbonlahor not being strikers, sure, in a 4-3-3 there's never more than one striker role... but that's not what I meant. Formations aren't rigid, and the two of them are capable strikers... so what's to say the team can't shift and make one of them more central, you know? For me, the greatest thing about Lambo's 4-3-3 is that it's so flexible. He could just as easily tell Gabby to drop deeper on the right, push Weimann forward, and shift Delph over to the left. Then he'd effectively have a 4-4-2 with the same players.

That said, I'm not sure we have the talent in central midfield for a traditional 4-4-2 just yet. I think Westwood with either Sylla or Delph in the middle alone isn't balanced enough. There needs to be a third person, who can drive forward while someone stays central to protect Westwood and the back four. Either that or Westwood sits out... which would leave us short handed creatively.

Don't get me wrong, I do think you're right about these new signings giving us options... I just don't think we're in a position to utilise them like that today. Newcastle have a strong midfield, so I'd expect Lambo to try and compress the middle (can't give players like Ben Arfa/Cabaye space) and keep working off the counter.

Might not sound very ambitious for a winnable home game, but a hard pressing game in midfield is pretty proactive. If you remember under O'Neill we were sort of similar. More compact and withdrawn when away, relying heavily on pacy breaks for goals... but much more willing to press at home, having some pretty open games.

A few decades back, children used to get caned in school. In US schools, it's still *optional* to ban corporal punishment, and it's still pretty common in the south. Where I went to high school, back in the late 90s, the principal had a wooden paddle that he regularly used.

This is all institutional, and not considered abuse. As far as corporal punishment in the home, there's no US law against it, and at the state level there's no hard and fast rule that defines what's corporal punishment and what's child abuse. One guy hit his kid with a maplewood paddle 36 times and had a child abuse charge reversed on appeal because they didn't want to set a precedent.

Some more FACTS!

http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/research/key-issues-for-the-new-parliament/value-for-money-in-public-services/the-ageing-population/

Much of today’s public spending on benefits is focussed on elderly people.  65% of Department for Work and Pensions benefit expenditure goes to those over working age, equivalent to £100 billion in 2010/11 or one-seventh of public expenditure.  Continuing to provide state benefits and pensions at today’s average would mean additional spending of £10 billion a year for every additional one million people over working age.

Growing numbers of elderly people also have an impact on the NHS, where average spending for retired households is nearly double that for non-retired households: in 2007/08 the average value of NHS services for retired households was £5,200 compared with £2,800 for non-retired.  These averages conceal variation across older age groups, with the cost of service provision for the most elderly likely to be much greater than for younger retired people.  The Department of Health estimates that the average cost of providing hospital and community health services for a person aged 85 years or more is around three times greater than for a person aged 65 to 74 years.

Yes, all those filthy old people defrauding our nation. &lt;/sarcasm&gt;

At 9, a guy got stabbed outside the apartment complex I was living at the time. 

At 12 or 13, same apartment complex, guy jumps off the roof. 

At 13 I walk out to see some guy breaking into my mom's car, before I could turn around and go inside,  he pulls out a gun and runs away. 

At 14, I get jumped on the way home from school. 

At 16, get robbed by three guys with my best friend at the time, they had their guns tucked under their belts, and as they surrounded us, they lifted their shirts just enough so you saw they were carrying. 

At 17, my mother and sister had a run in with the neighborhood kids, started groping them and what not. Kids dude..  

We had several more of these encounters with these little shits. Going to the police after every one. 

At 18, a cracked out prostitute got handsy with me trying to reach for my wallet and cigarettes. 

A few years later, I'm standing outside of the mechanics, and a guy walking by pulls a gun on me cause he thinks I looked at him. 

Last year, on Halloween, following Sandy, I was venturing out to look for a store that was opened, we had no power, and hadn't counted on it. I got mugged by 3 guys in broad daylight. They threw up colors before pulling a knife. 

I've never been affiliated with any gang activity, I've avoided trouble the best that I could. I'm courteous, and polite to anyone I meet in the streets, and I'm not safe, but banning guns would do nothing to make me feel safer. 

My perspective is much different than yours, I respect your opinions, but just cause it works for you doesn't mean it will work everywhere else. I'll even add that New Jersey gun laws are notoriously strict. So as someone said above, 'I live in fear and i use that as an excuse' maybe, but I'm just doing the best I can.

Back four was easy for me.  Walker has made his mistakes, but I'm ignoring the England match and he hasn't really been all that bad for us.

true,Darneil,cnty-wales,Cardiff,"Historical answer here, mixed with my degree in Quantity Surveying (Construction Economics).

Houses were developed like this during the Industrial Revolution (1700-1900) as a result to a need for low cost housing. People flooded to mining areas and ports for work. My example would be the valleys and Cardiff. You have huge areas of terrace housing in the valleys and examples of that in Cardiff (Most are renovated). This was to answer the need to house the vast swathe of migrants quickly and cheaply.

Liverpool was a massive port of the time, serving a lot of the local mining communities up there. People would have flooded there and as such, houses needed to be built. You then result in massive blocks of terrace housing.

Modern day, all the craze is in attached land to properties and bespoke designs as much as possible.

Society as a whole has been de-politicised. Involvement in politics is at an all time low. Party politics has drifted almost entirely to the centre, and have been there for most current students' lifetimes. 

Who are students meant to rally around? Conservatives have clearly never been an inspiring choice for students, Labour has consistently disappointed all but the most moderate on the centre-left and the Lib Dems (the usual party of protest) has obviously lost all student support for at least five years.

Further to that, students now have more study hours and higher living costs than ever. 40+ hour study weeks are not uncommon. Combined with that, lots of students now have to take minimum wage part time jobs (at the lowest real wages in years) in order to cover living costs. On top of all this, students are expected to spend a proportion of their free time on internships/volunteering/general ""enrichment"".

All of this is taking place in an environment in which graduate unemployment is at an all time high, student loans are higher than ever, and enrolment at university (and therefore competition) is higher than ever.

Don't get me wrong, I think censorship is wrong, never more so than when it is done under the guise of liberalism.

There are two ideas implicit in this:  
(A) that wanting to have sex with someone, man or woman, makes you ""bad"" in some way. And. 
(B) that when a woman says ""no"" to having sex with you, she may not have made up her mind and you shouldn't take that for an answer.  
  
Now feminism states that this encourages a rape culture. You might think ""its only a song, what harm could it do?"" But you have to realise this song has GLOBAL reach. From suburbs in New Jersey to slums in Mumbai this song will be playing. And not everyone who hears it will recognise that the song is not, in fact, encouraging rape. That where men can't get sex, and are really frustrated, they will honestly believe that the girl they are forcing themselves wants them. This is in fact how the majority of rapists think. They don't just step out the door one day and say ""I feel like raping someone"".

In 2011, the then Conservative transport secretary, Philip Hammond, alluded to the sharp rise in ticket prices since privatisation when he described train travel in the UK as ""a rich man's toy"". Five years earlier, economists at UBS bank said train travel in the UK was the most expensive in the world.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_prison#Cost.2FBenefit_analysis

&gt;Industry-funded studies often conclude that states can save money by using private prisons. However, state-funded studies have found that private prisons keep only low-cost inmates and send others back to state-run prisons.

&gt;A study by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics found that the cost-savings promised by private prisons “have simply not materialized.” Some research has concluded that for-profit prisons cost more than public prisons.

A fellow Jewish supporter here - posting from the middle of my Saturday morning class (scheduled especially for today), where they are serving breakfast (which I can't eat), and at which I cannot properly pay attention (because I have not eaten).  I could go on for a bit about the amusing appropriateness of a group of Jews discussing their multiple opinions about a subject related to Jewish self-identity and race, but I want to underscore a point I made a few days ago here, and which is reflected in OP's link but which I think should be reinforced.

""Yid"" is a vulgar word.  It's derogatory and hateful and comes from a place of hatred and intolerance.  It is the non-English equivalent of the word ""kike"", the Jewish equivalent of the word ""nigger"" or ""chink"" or ""mick"" or ""wetback"".  Whatever we want it to mean, or however we want to use it, that meaning has not disappeared; there are millions of Jews still alive today who have suffered the insult of being on the receiving end of that word - in the United Kingdom, in the United States, across Europe, wherever.  My father came to America in 1961, after 12 years in the Soviet Union; his travel papers listed his nationality not as ""Ukrainian"" - he was born in Kiev - but as ""Jew"", because Jews were considered an ""Other"" population within the USSR.  He remembers being addressed as ""Zhid"", the Russian variation of ""Yid"", many times during his childhood, never mind being approached by curious children looking for horns on his head and hooves for feet, because they'd been taught by their parents that this was what Jews looked like.

I'm not saying that words can't change their meanings, or be reclaimed from a dark and disgusting past.  But I am hesitant to be quite so protective of the ""Yid Army"" moniker and its related chants and self-identifications among Spurs supporters.  I think there would be quite a bit of shock, consternation, and discomfort in the black community if there were a team based in the Compton neighborhood of Los Angeles whose fans called themselves ""Crips and Bloods United"" or proclaiming that theirs was the ""Coon Army"".  I think race and derogation are too complex, as historical problems on both sides of the Atlantic, to think that we can re-appropriate the terms associated with them for our own purposes.

If our fans are going to use the word ""Yid"" - and I am not, repeat *not*, saying no words can ever develop different meanings and applications - I think they, and we, have an obligation to make sure that its history is fully and completely understood in its proper context.  And I think we should be careful before we proclaim or decide, as a collective group of fans, that we can say ""Yid"" without offending our own fans, or Jews generally.  The source of its usage for us (the long-standing association of the Jewish community with Tottenham and North London) is an admirable thing to respect and to try and turn around against anti-Semitic assholes from other clubs.  But it's a delicate subject, and should be addressed delicately.

Tottehnam - Shit game after shit game but squeezing out points

Arsenal - Quick goals, bad game control, give up leads, as deep as a Tottenham fan's wallet and too caught up in the circlejerk to see how poor their team is.

United - Not the same as last season as much as I expected them to be. Dropping points and the SAF mentality of grinding and pushing missing.

City - Not impressive at all, tactically they are extremely poor compared to last season. Great squad but like I predicted before the start of the season this team cant be consistent enough in the new manager's first season.

We try to contact unsuccessful applicants, but are not always able to; as you can imagine, we're usually way oversubscribed.

We always give people who've *not* played before a priority, as we like to have a gap between playtests.

true,moosecliffwood,null,null,"&gt;The arrangement of timbers is a series of tangents that describe the arc of the bridge, with radial members to tie the tangents together and triangulate the structure, making it rigid and self-supporting. This type of structure, technically tangent and radial trussing, is an efficient structural use of timber, and was also used for the timber supporting arches (centring) used for building stone bridges.[3] Analysis of the design shows that the radial timbers are almost entirely subject to compression with very little bending stress, or to put it another way, the radial lines elegantly express the forces involved in arched construction.

true,Mordisquitos,lancashire,Manchester,"One thing I simply can't understand about the UK is this meme* that keeps going around claiming it is unfair that a pint of beer in a pub is so much more expensive than in supermarkets, and that this is somehow driving pubs out of business through unfair competition. 

The argument is often made that beer in bars is cheaper on the continent and subject to fewer taxes.That might be true, but they completely ignore the fact that **beer in supermarkets on the continent is even cheaper by comparison**. 

I've lived in Spain, in France next to the German border, and in the UK. From my experience I can say that the UK is the country where the difference in cost between drinking at a pub and drinking at home is the lowest. If cheap supermarkets where the cause of British pub woes, Spanish bars and German biergartens would be much worse off.

Don't just take my anecdotal experience for granted. I had a quick look on Numbeo (user-contributed cost-of-living database) and compared the price of 0.5 l domestic beer in expensive and inexpensive cities from Spain, Germany and the UK. I'll express it as 0.5 l beer in a restaurant / 0.5 l beer in a supermarket.

**Spain**

[Madrid](http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/city_result.jsp?country=Spain&amp;city=Madrid): 3.00€/0.80€ = 3.75  
[Granada](http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/city_result.jsp?country=Spain&amp;city=Granada): 2.00€/0.50€ = 4  

**Germany**

[Munich](http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/city_result.jsp?country=Germany&amp;city=Munich): 3.40€/0.80€ = 4.25  
[Berlin](http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/city_result.jsp?country=Germany&amp;city=Berlin): 3.00€/0.79€ = 3.80  

**UK**

[London](http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/city_result.jsp?country=United+Kingdom&amp;city=London): £3.50/£1.50 = 2.33  
[Manchester](http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/city_result.jsp?country=United+Kingdom&amp;city=Manchester): £3.00/£1.79 = 1.67  

Both in Spain and Germany you pay four times as much for beer in a bar than if you were to go to a supermarket, while in the UK you can sometimes pay less than twice. Hell, in many Wetherspoons you can get pints of real ale on certain days for £1.49, which can beat the price you'd pay for the same beer in a supermarket! That would be unthinkable in Madrid.

Basically, much as I love beer and pubs, the British pub industry is a bunch of crybabies when it comes to claiming that they take a loss from supermarkets.

Nasri started dropping deeper to get the ball, and thus Rodwell and Yaya pushed up and clogged it more. Jovetic looks good on the ball. He's quick, pacy, and works well with a striker. I don't understand why he was not used on the left. He says he's best on the left, put him there! Let him and Nasri connect to create, and let Negredo find channels in between the backline. Instead, they clogged up the space for runs, and thus nothing could be found. This clogging forcers shorter passes, which slows the game. Everyone loves Milner, but again he wasn't the pace we needed to stretch Stoke out down the right side. I thought there was a mix of tactical misuse here. We played like Stoke, instead of playing like City at Stoke. We should have spread this team out, beat them with quick passes underneath them, and gotten goals early. Then you bring on Rodwell, Milner, etc and let them grind the last half out. 

Philosophically, I hate leaving games to be won until late. I'd rather break it open early. Nonetheless, I'm not bashing MP, I'm just saying that we didn't get it right today. Nastasic is my MOTM, very solid at the back. Fortunately for Stoke, they didn't make any mistakes. You need to be perfect against a team like City to get points, and they were. One mistake and we may have capitalized. They marked every header, and caught every ball. No slips, not many cards and fouls. We should have earned a few more corners, played some deeper balls, and took more defenders on. We didn't force mistakes, and played so slowly that our passes were predictable. Stoke took advantage and played well. Credit to them. Let's get it together, get quicker, get fitter, and get 3 in the Czech Republic and focus up for derby day. If people are out for MP now, I wouldn't want to see them after dropped points in a week's time.

Sig did reasonably well being a wide winger for us last season, it looks like AVB is trying him in a more direct inside forward role and it worked this game. He's also useful on set pieces.

true,MiaVee,yorkshire,Sheffield/London,"**EDIT** I know these usually go at the bottom, but some fellow posters have corrected me, some politely, some not-so politely, that I was actually a bit off in this post. 

I'll leave the original comment as-is, but apologise that I overlooked some recent and very significant moves forward by world leaders in approaching and tackling the issue of tax avoidance. This is an extremely welcome step forward and one that is long overdue. I still stand by the original post, as the situations and behaviours described are ones that have been too prominent for too long and the whole culture of cronyism and party payments for policies are sketchy and problematic. These are not things that are specific to the UK.

I completely understand and agree that benefit fraud is a problem. However, actions take to prevent this are already in place and while they're weeding out some of the genuine fraudsters, unfortunately a lot of very vulnerable people have been very negatively affected as they get caught up in mistakes in the new system or are disqualified completely from the support they need to survive. 

I recently became so disabled that I had to leave my career in central Government and am, for the first time in my life, dependent on state support. The process to claim benefits, particularly ones for being out of work due to illness or disability, are lengthy, invasive to the point of being utterly humiliating and demoralising. Even for much more run of the mill payments like income support and housing benefits, you and everybody else in your home has to submit to some level of scrutiny. 

I know that my anecdotal experience does not a dataset make, but I am a bright, educated youngish person. I've organised multimillion pound budgets and written speeches for heads of state. Yet navigating the welfare system has been little short of gruelling and immensely stressful. That does not mean that it isn't possible to game the system fraudulently, but I'm hoping it highlights that it isn't just as simple as saying ""ooh, I've thrown me back out, please fill this sack with cash so I can get a new plasma screen and a trip to Barbados.""

There is also the constant threat that I may have everything cut off as the result of an ATOS assessment heavily weighted against people with disabilities like mine. While the system no doubt works for a lot of people, the numerous cases, some high profile, some invisible, where it has failed and cost people everything from their independence to their lives cannot be ignored.  But that is somewhat besides my main point, which is that benefit frauds and lazy dickheads do not exist on anything like the scale some media outlets would have us believe. It doesn't mean that it's not a problem that should be addressed, but it does mean that we need to have a much more critical approach to kerfuffles made about ""workshy parasites"" ripping us off and driving us all into debt. 

I also said I would try to find more information on how the benefits budget in the UK is dustributed. The article I was thinking of [is here](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/06/welfare-britain-facts-myths) but frames the issue in terms of child tax credits and payments to people in employment. It's from the Guardian so I'll keep an eye out for other sources of related information in the interests of balance and update here if I find anything useful or relevant.

I apologise for not taking recent developments into account while writing this post initially and am thankful for the people who drew my attention to it. Even those who decided to chuck in an ad hominem or two. Stay classy. **/Edit**

I've tried phrasing this a few ways to make it sound less cynical, without much success, so I'll try...

Big business means big donations to the party so lobbyists get to bend the politicians' ears to ensure their interests and profits are protected. This helps enormously to keep things like tax avoidance and profligate risk-taking in the banking sector nice and legal. The consequences of which, as we have seen, are felt most sharply by the parts of society who already had very little financial wiggle room to begin with. These are the same people who politicians (not all, but a lot) only have to encounter for a couple of hours a week at constituency surgeries. They're little people, with little problems, and if they didn't want to struggle for cash they should have gone to Eton for a proper education then ridden the nepotism train into politics. They get their surgeries, what more do they want?

Tax avoidance is legal, so why should politicians do anything about it? Personally I think it's pretty damn unethical, but Amazon would probably argue that their responsibility is to their shareholders so it would be unethical from their perspective if they DIDN'T take advantage of every loophole possible. 

Benefits are something that most politicians will never need to survive. People on benefits can't afford to make massive party donations and cosy up to politicians. It's also worth noting that the majority of our benefit payments (I forgot the actual number and am on my phone, will try to find it later) go to pensioners who have worked all their lives. Again, these aren't people who can make massive party donations to cosy up to MPs. They're a lot less visible than the CEOs and PR people signing the donation cheques, so they must be less important, surely?

It's also more difficult for your average man-on-the-street to conceptualise tax avoidance by a huge multinational than the benefit fraud bogeynan created by the Daily Mail. They might be a bit annoyed at Starbucks, but they can really *hate* the family down the street who have a slighter bigger telly and no jobs. Never mind that that telly was probably bought on store credit and they'll be paying for it for the next two years, or that their kids will be even more brutally bullied at school of they don't get to wear nice trainers. No, I work hard, so fuck those fraudulent bastards. I'll stop buying Starbucks coffee though. Even though Starbucks outlets are franchise owned and boycotting hurts the local franchise owner, who HAS to pay a full tax bill, far more than it will the corporation itself.

Ultimately, benefit errors are never going to account for much of the UKs financial problems, especially while the Tories are in power. But benefits claimants are a very convenient scapegoat to keep the population distracted and angry while corporations funnel money out of our economy and into their back pockets unchecked.",0,1379179434,null,0,1379187747,0,cc897ev,t3_1mdoeo,t1_cc897ev,t1_cc87rky,null,1429465226,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

Torres has scored some important goals but has been nowhere near as important or as much of an icon for Chelsea.

The point is that Torres has is own following that randomly follow the club when really all they really care about is the fucking cult of Torres. The non-plastics are tired of this shit. A video of supreme Zola quality was posted at the same time simply to show the extent of this problem.

It's not about liking Torres or not liking Torres it's about having respect for players who have worked hard and earned it not just being a random fanboy for a hairdresser.

But aside from that, no I don't like Torres, he takes massive amounts of attention and defending and well it's bad for team morale, attentiveness and frankly if it wasn't for the Mourinho media machine he would still have the spotlight on him and his emotional state.

True. But more importantly people like Torres over the club. Many people here would follow Chelsea less if Torres left. Yes they may buy shirts, that helps financially but it doesn't help the Chelsea brand.

&gt;When, obviously, there are a lot of new fans to Chelsea.

True. It doesn't mean they shouldn't learn about Chelsea or their history. There are a lot of people here who come to this sub and all they really want to see is instagrams and stuff worshipping Torres. Despite the fact that Torres has been more or less awful since he joined the club. Don't get me wrong, I was one of the people with ""faith"", he'll be fine. As were many other people I know. Literally all of them and I, have got to the point where we would rather he didn't play and would rather he wasn't involved with the squad. His negatives are simply huge by this point.

&gt; What's ignorant is the fact that you think people HAVE to like Zola over Torres

If you have any idea about this club then about the squad, the playing of youth players when possible, our finances and reputation of the club Torres is not a player you'd be pledging your full blown support to over other players.

Some tips from my own experience:
If you're on the bus, depending on bus route and time of day/night, don't sit too near the back or upstairs.
I've actually been set alight on the single-decker 10A before now by little bastards in the back row of seats who were playing with a lighter.
That said, usually it's nothing so bad, just having to listen to loud, incessant crap music from their mobile phones.

I'll probably get some hate for this but my honest rule-of-thumb, based on experience, is generally: If they're teenagers or under (I'm including young kids here too - just cos they're 8 years old doesn't mean they won't try and start a fight), and have a shaved head or are wearing tracksuits, and there's more than one of them clustering, especially if they don't seem to be doing anything in particular (i.e. if they're hanging around near the off-license), then avoid them like the plague.

So that's the bad stuff.

- Hazard was completely pretty much non existant the first half. Too much dribbling in the second half and too many 1 vs 3, which ended up in him losing the ball.

- Ramires looked very dangerous when given the freedom. Had a sloopy pass right before the half to give Everton their goal.

- Schurrle, nothing to say, but an absolutely awful preformance by him.

- Eto'o, I'm not really sure what to say. He had some nice link ups and also had some dumb mistakes. Pretty much the story of the match for Chelsea. His feet much be made of rock. Had no touch at all.

I really didn't understand the substitutions. Ramires looked great being free. Now, you put him as a psuedo winger?

It's one of the reasons I'm so loathe to pay for a divorce: I've already wasted more than enough money on the mofo. 

When he did work he earned a small fortune though. I could never quite figure out where it all went. Yep, we'd go to some fantastic restaurants and have fine cocktails and fun, but it never fully added up to 2-3k a week. Turned out he'd become a fully blown alcoholic (I'm told they buy everyone in the pub drinks, so that explains some of the money), possibly had a drug habit that I was blissfully unaware of, and most certainly paid other women for sex, which is pretty insulting when your sex life is amazing.

Obviously rather see his wife work herself into a coma and nearly lose her mind through stress than lower himself by £5 an hour or whatever.

The only thing I can think of is the world's lamest mugging.  Walking home at about 9pm, but it was winter so it was dark.  This lad comes up and says he's got a knife, and to hand over my bag.  Rule number one of a successful mugging, kids, don't try it in a neighbourhood you've lived for fifteen years, and if you do, cover your bloody face up.  I recognised him.  I wasn't feeling too chipper, so the first words out of my mouth were ""Fuck off, Joe"".  He looked proper surprised, and ran off.

I thought about it for a couple of days.  Neighbourhood gossip held it that he was a potential father of his ex's kid, so I didn't really want to report him to the police if that turned out to be true; he didn't have a reputation as a bit of a crim.  So I did the evillest thing I could think of: I went round and told him mum.  She wasn't happy, to say the least.

Anyway, I saw him a couple of months ago in the shop.  The kid did turn out to be his, and he moved in with the girlfriend, who's pregnant again, and now he works as a security guard, not making great money, but making enough.  He said he was glad he never went any further down that road and his mum found out and dragged him back on the straight and narrow, or he wouldn't have any of that.  I dunno if he knows I told her or if he thinks she just heard it through the grapevine, but I'm pretty happy I did the right thing.

true,Girlwithnousername,,Proud 2nd member of STFC Official Fan Club. Go the oranges!,"&gt; So um heeeeeeeeeeeey you wanna grab a drink sometime or something?

I'm pretty broke at the moment: are you paying? I suspect you'll retract that request now ;)

&gt;With the divorce side I believe you are best to wait four years since break then you can both fill forms and get it sorted for very little money? Never been married so I dunno much about that side

I left him 12 years ago. It costs £500. I can find so many nicer things to spend £500 on. He might've divorced me by now or could be dead. I have no idea. I doubt he would though, the last I heard from him he was refusing to give me a divorce because then-gf would insist on getting married, and obviously he was sleeping around and very much did not want to. I got the impression he didn't ever want to get married again, I was his big love etc etc. He threw himself out of a third floor window when I left him. 

&gt;Looking back now I bet you are feeling very free and lucky to have got rid of him?

Hell yes. It was seven years of on/off/on/off. But it was also thoroughly addictive. Perhaps I had to go through that to get liking bad men out of my system. I sort as feel as though marrying him gave me the ability to leave him forever, if that makes any sense at all. 

&gt;like some to the above and stay in a marriage, grow some balls and grow up and tell your partner you aren't happy and stop destroying 2 lives!

I don't do that anymore. When things go bad or if I even start thinking that someone I'm seeing may not be being faithful, I just walk. Even having the seed of doubt in my mind tells me that if you don't trust them, that's not good, and it's time to leave. The last time this happened was last summer. Turned out he'd slept with a former college mate while visiting her when he was seeing me. Intuition is a good thing. 

&gt;Were you aware of the drink/drugs at the time? I imagine that wasn't easy to hide.

He always drank an awful lot, in fact we did as a couple really, but no, I had no idea how bad it was. Apparently my mother did though. She'd been married to an alcoholic and so knew the signs but didn't tell me. She claims that I wouldn't have listened to her... err, what? Anyway, the first I knew of it was when I did a massive spring clean of the house and found six half empty vodka bottles hidden everywhere. I tried to help him through it for a year or more, but then he pulled that shit with me on holiday and that was the final straw. The drugs: also no. Until he came home off his face once and offered me a line of coke. I had no idea. I also don't know how much he took/how often, but it helps to explain why we never seemed to have any spare money when he was working. 

He was a very messed up man. Depression, addiction, wasted intellect. I think the wasted intellect was the root of all his problems really. Still, he gave me Bowie, and for that, I will be forever grateful.

Unless you're so rich that you can afford to fly us somewhere sweet on your private jet for champagne cocktails, I think you'll find we're going halves, cheers. 

&gt;Reading some of your comments above is pulling some chords in my past as well, it's easy to be bitter about such things but actually I take it more as a well earned lesson, a necessary part of understanding the human relationship and moving on with yourself as a stronger &amp; wiser person.

I'm generally a pretty optimistic person, and even when things seem absolutely terrible, reflect and try to learn from them. Everything happens for a reason, etc. Unfortunately that relationship has fucked me up more than a bit though. Not because I'm still in love with him (nothing could be further from the truth), but more that I'm always searching for excitement, and when things aren't exciting and/or there is no drama, it feels quite wrong to me. I've probably left a few really good men because of this. I can happily live without the drama but the excitement thing... well, that IS addictive. Damn it. 

&gt;Nice to see you tried to help him and turn him around, you clearly loved him and were not selfish about what that meant.

Ha, oh god yes. 'Would I stand in front of a loaded gun for this man' is possibly an unhealthy question to be asking yourself when in a new relationship, but sadly one I ask myself more often than is healthy. I would've killed for him, and probably vice versa. Shame he had to turn out to be such an arsehole. 

&gt; can certainly see why you'd be grateful, its hard to pick a favorite as he's done a lot of amazing stuff, this is one of mine though: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMThz7eQ6K0

Lots of people don't rate his 80s stuff at all, but I do. Ashes to Ashes is a fantastic tune. My favourites change all the time. My current favourite is [All The Mad Men](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb7Xdu7STx8), which is apt for this thread. His voice in it kills me with admiration.

I think a lot of the biggest teams are simply wary of signing players from the Eredivisie. Vertonghen and Suarez didn't go to teams in the Champions League either. [De Boer urged Barcelona to sign Vertonghen to solve their defensive problems before he went to Spurs](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2138826/Jan-Vertonghen-urged-join-Barcelona.html) but they didn't go for him. Having a poor Euro didn't help him (Eriksen) either.

A lot of people on this subreddit seem to be under the impression that Eriksen has stalled in his progress over the last couple of seasons, but that really isn't the case. He was Ajax's best player last year and shows remarkable maturity, consistency, and professionalism for a 21 year old. He's also never injured. Personally, I think he'll do very well wherever he goes.

I'm sure that there are stories that his agent planted in the media, but he did turn down Bayer Leverkusen (3rd in Germany last season) where he would have had a much bigger contract than at Ajax.

They all worked out at a profit which was then put into the next one, but and this is a big but, they were all bought with the motive of living somewhere I liked with out the hassle of landlords.  Don't buy somewhere just because its a bargain unless you want to flip it quickly.  These days I don't think you can sell up that quick if your plans change or if they build a meat rendering plant next door.

Words of advice..

Get your mortgage offer sorted before you start to look properly.  Also if your doing this with your G/F, work out who owns what etc and get it put down in writing with a solicitor.  Its not romantic but a few years down the line it could save you a load of stress if things don't work out. 

If you are keen on somewhere, get an independent survey done. The more knackered the property, the more you need to know about it. A mortgage evaluation from the lender wont tell you if the roof beams are sagging and will need replacing or that the cavity walls are full of old asbestos insulation.

If your looking at knackered houses - don't underestimate how much effort (if your doing it your self), money (if your getting professionals to do it or if your  DIY) and the shear amount of time its going to take.  It took me 6 months working full time to get my current house from derelict to habitable (roof on, windows in, floors, central heating, running water and a working kitchen) and a further 2 years working evenings and weekends to make it into somewhere you would want to live (indoor bathroom, paint on the walls, doors, that kind of thing etc). I still need to put in skirting boards, tile the kitchen, rebuild the porch 7 and a hundred of other little jobs years later! 

As far as doing stuff your self goes - do it all apart from plastering.  Building isn't rocket science; you can learn this stuff as you go along.  Just use the internet, write out a plan and go slowly.  Plastering however is an art form.  Also buy a cheap nasty van as delivery prices and skips will add masses to your budget - then sell it when you finish.

As for me, attacks were mostly in the form of childhood bullying, me being the victim. It often went way beyond the 'advice' of ""just ignore them and they'll go away"".  
  
When I was about 13-14, I was walking with a friend to her house. I lived about 5 minutes (walking) away from her. Some dickhead who had it in for me was following us, I turned around to tell him to fuck off and saw most of the kids in the village (aged between 12 and 17) standing at the end of the road.  
  
I carried on walking and he came up and kicked me in the hip/pelvic area (just above my arse). I turned and swung for him out of instinct, missed, then he had his hands round my throat trying to throttle me.  
I somehow managed to kick him in the balls and he let go.  
Luckily a random person from a house nearby saw everything and let us in to call our parents.  
Minutes later my stepdad, a fucking huge, 6ft tall farm worker, was storming towards the group of kids and told them that if they ever laid a hand on me again he would be in their face with his shotgun.  
We spoke to the police about the guy that attacked me, but nothing ever came of it.  
  
Another time, aged about 15, I was on my way to the local shop. I decided to get there via a path/alley type thing (the garden gates of the house opened right onto the path) that ran behind a row of terraced houses. Halfway down there were 2 lads that fucking hated me for no reason - both a couple of years older than me - hitting a wall with a cricket bat. They saw me and threatened to beat the shit out of me with the bat, so I screamed for help.  
  
The gate nearest us opened and it was one of the lads' mother that was standing there. She shouted at me for ""making a fucking racket"", to me to ""stop being such a little slag"" then *fucking slapped me across the face* me when I pointed out that her son was threatening me.  
Again, the police were called but nothing was done.  
  
More recently, any aggro I get comes in the form of drunk men coming on to me in the pub and being called a ""fucking teasing bitch"" when I've shown absolutely no interest in them and I point out that my fiancé is standing metres away.  
Also, a ridiculous amount of people have made snide comments about my breasts, everything from ""nice tits"" to ""probably fake"".  
They're real, you knobheads.

true,EnglishNumpty,cnty-england,England,"&gt;From what I understand, the entertainment industry isn't as massive and important as you seem to be suggesting it is. In the music industry the amount of people being provided a living is tiny in comparison to larger sectors like construction or services.

I suggested thousands of people are directly reliant on the creative industries for their livelihoods. I didn't compare it to construction or services, not that any of this is relevant to the discussion in the first place.

&gt;The contribution it makes to society is irrelevant in comparison in pretty much every sense possible.

It's irrelevant to the discussion completely, the size and the ""contribution"" make no difference to whether their property should be protected or not.

&gt;I'm not sure if you've noticed but there aren't thousands upon thousands of recording studios across the country feeding hard working sound engineers.

It really depends what you count as being the media industry. A HR director at Vue is reliant on the film industry, but he doesn't work on films. 

&gt;The majority of the money from music goes straight back into the record companies holding the copyrights, with a small scrap of it conceded as royalties to the contributing artists and a pittance paid to the people that help piece that music together in the studio.

This is exactly the kind of nonsense I get every time I saw I support cracking down on piracy. People like you start coming out with these side issues, its almost as though you're justify your piracy by painting it as a stand against *evil capitalism*.

&gt;These companies that once served a purpose in distributing the music as records and CDs are now just clinging to their outdated business model and strangling any attempts to put that money back where it belongs; in the hands of the artists that make the music.

You're not putting the money in the hands of the artists when you pirate music.

Yes, it was not nice. Also, the cowards really picked an easy target. The poor sod was only 5ft 1 tall. I grew up in Brixton where mixed race relationships were the norm, the first boy I ever kissed was black, and even way back then that wasn't unusual, so it was a bit of a nasty wake up call about how rife racism really is in the UK. 

Jesus christ, where do you live? I need to know because I want to never go there. 


&gt;Also, a ridiculous amount of people have made snide comments about my breasts, everything from ""nice tits"" to ""probably fake"".
They're real, you knobheads.

Hahahahahahaha. Mine aren't big enough to be accused of being fake but I hear you sister. Some men are such suckers for the rack that it beggars belief. I find it simultaneously amusing and disappointing. After years of disbelief I have settled on using the puppies to my advantage when it suits me. I had a boss who would only ever converse with my breasts instead of my face, even when they were completely covered up. After a year of working for him and us having fairly amiable conversations whereby my breasts apparently did the talking, I decided that the best route to getting the payrise I wanted was to let them escape a little bit in a low-cut dress when we had the 'I need more money' conversation. I got the pay rise.

But I think you are right, they are already wheeling out ridiculous figures for lost sales due to piracy. $240bn is a vast amount of money, 10% of UK GDP. Are they seriously saying that if piracy was stamped out, that amount of money would just appear out of nowhere for people to spend on CDs and DVDs?

It is sad to see police resources being wasted on such nonsense.

Again, the opposition had clear chances on goal, which they completely missed. Surely we would've been punished had we allowed that in the Premier league.

Zamora had a mostly poor game again, we looked much better when he was taken off.

Hill was easily beaten by pace, something opposition managers will make note of.

SWP kept good possession and often won the ball, I think he's too easily criticised by some QPR fans. He won't score many goals but is someone I like to see play for us.

QPR players were not moving into positions for interception of forward passes until the 2nd half.


It's difficult to criticise whilst we have gone unbeaten so far this season. Hopefully the new players will add some strength in possession and some very much needed fire-power.

When I was 10, the neighbour had a fight in his front garden with some guy who flipped his shit threatening to shoot him etc, threw a bin through neighbour's front window. Police came eventually and took him away. I watched it from my parent's bedroom window in childish curiosity.

true,CapnJager,,Rum and coke. No ice.,"&gt;I grew up in Brixton where mixed race relationships were the norm, the first boy I ever kissed was black, and even way back then that wasn't unusual, so it was a bit of a nasty wake up call about how rife racism really is in the UK.

I grew up in Oxenholme, a little village just outside of Kendal. The racism there (and in surrounding areas) was astounding. I used to babysit a family friend's kid - her mum is British-Indian and her dad is white-British and this poor girl would get so much shit in school.  

One of my best friends in secondary school was Muslim and chose to wear a headscarf when she turned a certain age (16, I think?) and she got so much hate from people.  
The small-mindedness of people in rural areas is horrible, it's like they're stuck in the 1950s.  
I lived there for 13 years and I fucking hate the Lake District now. Getting out was the best thing I did.  
  
I currently live in Merseyside and have done for the past 5 years. I love it here. It has its flaws, but I'm happy.  
  
&gt;I had a boss who would only ever converse with my breasts instead of my face, even when they were completely covered up. After a year of working for him and us having fairly amiable conversations whereby my breasts apparently did the talking, I decided that the best route to getting the payrise I wanted was to let them escape a little bit in a low-cut dress when we had the 'I need more money' conversation. I got the pay rise.  
  
Nice. :-D My boss is an absolute perv, he's been my fiancé's best friend for 20 years so I know how to cope with his bullshit. He says the most outrageously perverted things to me and I know exactly how to answer. (The other day he admitted to having a wank over one of my photos ... I was published topless in Bizarre magazine this month so I don't give a shit. When he asks for more photos I just direct him to my profile on Bizarre and tell him to pay to look at the ones containing nudity).

That's not a Reddit thing, that's a worldwide thing. My last office mate told me some really shitty stories about what it's like to be black in England. She has a really nice car and gets comments along the lines of 'so, what does your husband do for a living?', the assumption being that he must of course be a drug dealer. My suggestion to her was to stock her boot up with a bunch of vibrators and other sex toys so that the next time she gets pulled over, she can embarrass the fuck out of the policemen by saying that she makes a very good living through making your average white lady happy (that's an urban myth, but let's not go there now). I don't think she's going to go for it, but the thought of the red-faced copper seeing that leaves me highly amused.

It has been tough on Pelle so far this season (no doubt you're about to tell me about the lower table teams we've faced so far...) but with a total of 4 injured CB's, a new league to familiarise himself with and a completely new team it's not hard to understand why it's been tough for him. 

We're still 4th with the best goal difference in the league (and this is the point where you remind me every point makes the difference). With a win over the top 6 teams lets say, we can afford to drop a couple of points this early on. 

Why has Javi been starting? Well I suppose the past few games we've literally not had any other options other than Boyata and as much as I would loved to have seen him play, he hasn't. So today we had a couple more options available but with CL football midweek and Salford United at weekend, I'd much prefer to see our fully fit CB's push around RVP and Rooney than be injured and watch lescott get destroyed. 

So where do we stand now? 34 games to go and 102 points available we still are title contenders (in case you have forgotten!) and can easily make up for a slow start. I think Pelle needs to start pulling things together instead of flying kites with the midfield and boss around his players a bit. ""Yaya, sprint down the middle into the CBs and as the LB comes in to help out pass the ball out wide to Navas who can swing it in to Negredo, Aguero or play it back to yourself. Meanwhile Rodwell, you cover the CM position to collect balls headed out of the box and Kompany mark the striker sitting on the half way line"". A few more pep talks like this from Manuel would give the players much more understanding of what they're meant to do. Come winter transfer window I expect a little movement if our play stays the same.

And you're right, of course, corporate donations to political parties aren't something that's going to stop any time soon, tax or no tax. I don't believe that corporate donations are necessarily an inherently evil thing, but they can easily be used to blur the lines of ethical policy making and lobbying. 

I knew that the work was ongoing but, partly from having worked in government and seen it first hand, I know there's a big big difference between talking about something/publicising a decision and seeing that decision acted on and enforced. I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but it's a long process even when the relevant outside stakeholders are happy to go along with it.

I'm glad that world leaders have finally taken their fingers out of their ears to acknowledge this as a problem. No matter when the process started, it was never going to happen overnight, but the fact the first steps have been publicly taken is very encouraging. 

Also, just because our leaders are finally starting to get serious about tax avoidance doesn't excuse them dragging their heels for reasons steeped in cronyism and cash-for-policy.

No it doesn't.

First of all if you end up employing an EU migrant then it means the local people are horrendous candidates. Migrants don't even have English as their first language, so if they beat a local candidate then it speaks volumes about their quality.

Secondly if we employ a migrant then they contribute economically and consume economically. The net result is, broadly speaking, another job created.

I know.  There are STILL Americans who don't ""get"" Monty Python.

One of the big differences is the quirks of language - our English differs enough to make a serious problem when presenting some ideas.

The other big difference, to me, is that English humor is so often subtle or has a certain subtlety to it that us Yanks miss it.  American humor often comes at you like a sledge hammer or a slamming steel door, and the Brits don't always appreciate that.  Rich Hall has a style that comes naturally to him and which the Brits seem to enjoy - he's often subtle with his humor.  You have to THINK to get his stuff sometimes.  I like that kind of humor.  Carlin was a MASTER of that.  If you didn't keep your brain engaged, he'd leave you in the dust.  He did, however, have enough ""slamming door"" humor in his presentations to keep everybody engaged.

Izzard is a comedic genius also.  I think he didn't ""translate"" well because of the language barrier and the fact that so much of what he did required that you NOT turn your brain off during the performance.

I'd love to see Louis CK make the trip, but he's going to have to take a couple classes on Brit humor if he wants to do well.

As for Rio de Janeiro, not such a good example as it was the capital until 1960, Brasilia was new city designed to be a neutral capital in a more central location. 

In regard to the old world capital cities, they have often been capitals or major world cities for centuries. Lots of history and culture there, and it's usually where all the big museums and galleries are as well. And there is the iconic stuff as well.

We're missing a focal point to the attack, we can see the opportunities being created, the amazing movement of our attacking midfielders, but as soon as we reach the opposition box, if one of them doesn't pull the trigger, we have to rely on Torres/Ba/Eto'o.

We've seen what the two former strikers are capable of, and it's unfair to put Eto'o in there, as we haven't really seen him yet, but its no secret that he's a short term solution.

&gt; That said, AV could have proved horrible in it's works. Been more against the popular vote perversely. Had it been accepted we would have had a settlement as bad as FPTP that would have been established as agreeable. No change. Conversely, by having a ref on this miserable fudge has prevented meaningful change for a generation

It's the other side of the argument I suppose. But that again is just a hangover from this weird binary approach to reality modern British politics has. A vote which is lost by 13 is regarded as a crushing defeat of an idea, ignoring the 49% of votes in favor. In truth, I fear you are right, yes on AV would be considered overwhelming support in favor of the system over all others rather than ""let's try this, see how it works and tweak/change it as needed later on"" which is how I see it.

&gt; This was the LibDem's price for allowing one of the most right wing governments to operate. It put a block on nothing. The Tories knew they would lose and told them so directly. You can't even say they were mislead.

I think it's been pretty obvious that this team is not the same without Mata. Our attack so far has been disjointed and lacking in clear direction. Today we were creating chances but couldn't execute. Then he came off and everyone started to look panicked and disorganized. Likewise if you remember back to last season we lost the ability to transition out of the midfield without Hazard out there.

Hazard is really the only player we have right now that can move past multiple markers on command. That's why Everton marked him with 3 men and why he is consistently our most fouled player. Other teams realize how dangerous he is and foul him instead of giving him the chance to move with the ball.

I've always felt that it is aimed at families, however I don't think the series as a whole is, I think different episodes are aimed at different audiences. Some episodes felt very much like a child would get a bigger kick out of it than I would but some I've thought were very adult.

For example I felt like ""The Impossible Planet"" and ""The Satan Pit"" were genuinely scary and more for the adult audience, where as other episodes such as ""The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe"" were more appropriate for a younger audience. 

Saying that however, I have grown up watching the modern doctor who (I would've been 12 when doctor who returned I think) so maybe what I perceived as adult at various times may be inaccurate.

I also think that if you take the Sarah Jane Adventures and Torchwood in to account they're aimed at opposite ends of the audience spectrum which would lead me to believe doctor who is the bridge between audiences rather than aimed at one or the other.",0,1379217402,null,0,false,0,cc8kckc,t3_1m8j0q,t1_cc8kckc,t3_1m8j0q,null,1429459884,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;In response to both yours and the post above; the time saved spent policing cannabis use would be negligible as minimal time is currently spent on it. If any drug is pursued by a force, it is always class A. Street Warnings exist as another tool to not waste time with Cannabis, just an acknowledgment that having it is against the rules and you were caught.

I posted a comment to your fellow police officer yesterday which seemed to show the opposite, based on [the latest data on prevalence versus seizures](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1m8p7s/london_police_must_pay_for_sony_warehouse_damaged/cc7hmw5). Of course, this doesn't strictly measure ""time spent"" (it could be that the cannabis seizures are almost entirely quick stop and searches whereas the Class A seizures are mostly full blown operations), and there are other possible interpretations, but it does _imply_ cannabis is targeted, either intentionally or simply because of the manner in which drugs are policed.",0,1379220017,null,0,false,0,cc8l120,t3_1mekp5,t1_cc8l120,t1_cc8ick0,null,1429459567,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3
