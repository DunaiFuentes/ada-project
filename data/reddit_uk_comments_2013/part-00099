However, I do have a theory in terms of how the Doctors have been portrayed. This is somewhat in response to what you said about Matt not showing or interpreting emotion.

As you stated, Nine is right after the Time War. He's manic but yet an emotional wreck. He meets Rose, a human, and he and Ten both fall for her. Rose is literally the first and last thing Ten sees. Then he not only loses her (twice), but he loses every one of his companions, and he loses one of the last remaining ties to his own race - the Master. Ten is the Doctor of emotion to me. He loves and loses all throughout his time as the Doctor. When he regenerates, he realizes he doesn't want to leave or die, therefore turning into Eleven. He has some very childish and goofy moments (which I think is also part of Matt's personality as well), but I think Eleven is supposed to be a reaction to Ten's pain. He's afraid to get close or love anyone, which would explain his relationship with River and why he was so distraught after losing the Ponds. So I think Eleven's distant relationship with emotion could be considered a personality depth or arc for the Doctor as a whole person throughout the new series.

No probs, 

I have to say when van der vaart and modric left I was really questioning what impact you guys were going to make this season, they were the heart of your midfield but with bale coming into his own and the purchases you made to replace them its worked out well for you and with a new manager as well I can see what your saying about expectations at the start.

I do not remember this reference. Do you have a rough idea of where in the episode it occurs? I'd love to have a firmer time stamp for positioning this episode in River's timeline.

&gt; This would mean that in River's timeline, The Impossible Astronaut occurs immediately before Silence in the Library.

This is incorrect. During ""The Impossible Astronaut"" River is still in prison. Ergo, we know that ""Angels Take Manhattan"" must occur *after* this episode. And we also know that ""Last Night"" takes place after this episode.

&gt; The Doctor dies in The Impossible Astronaut.

The older version of River already knows that this is not true.

&gt; Now, the old Doctor knows he has to die because it's a fixed point in time. 

Wrong again. The old Doctor is already inside the Tesselecta and is at least fairly certain that he's not going to die.

&gt; They still met in the wrong order.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; 11 has often said how he killed all of the timelords.

Except they're not dead. Locked away, perhaps, and he may feel like they're ""dead to the universe"", and he might not be happy about that - but given a choice between ""let them out, they destroy time"" and ""fuck it, they can stay put"", the melodrama is getting a bit tiresome.

&gt; Where John Hurt is, numerically speaking, doesn't really interest me all that much.

\#11 said ""I know"" and this implied that it was previously in his own timeline. Either that, or he knows about the worst things he's going to do in his personal future, and he's not supposed to know that sort of thing.

&gt; The main theory I read was that John Hurt started the Time War. This is probably the only thing that fits in my mind. Roughly though. Why would you need to start a war with the Daleks? Wouldn't they be all too willing?

The Doctor (number 4, iirc) was ordered to go to Skaro, by the Time Lords, in order to exterminate the Daleks, before they got off their homeworld. They were already genocidal megalomaniacs - they didn't become bad because the Doctor tried to destroy them. In fact, the Doctor refused to destroy them.

There's an argument that this ""started"" the time war, although at that point in his personal time line, the Daleks had already destroyed large numbers of worlds, and were one of the bigger threats the universe had faced. Oh, and at the time, he mentioned that all the worlds who had come together to fight the Daleks wouldn't have done so without a common enemy.

At worst, maybe the Time Lords wibbly-wobblied the time war into an inevitable conflict by issuing the order to exterminate the Daleks, but to say that the Doctor started it by refusing to commit genocide seems a little, well, hard to justify, really. If anything, ""keeping the promise"" and refusing to commit genocide is the opposite of ""breaking the promise"".

Hell, in ""The Beast Below"" the Doctor agreed to kill the space whale to save the humans, and said that this was so awful that he could never call himself ""The Doctor"" again. Obviously, he didn't do it.

Killing all the Daleks in order to prevent the Time War could be ""breaking the promise of his name"", even if done for the greater good.

But if Doctor Mysterious is ""the one who broke the promise"" by destroying all the Daleks, then he's not #4.

&gt; What really interests me is what he did to break the promise of The Doctor.

I have some bad news.

Just as ""silence will fall"" has been abandoned since the Silence on Earth were presumably killed off, despite the lack of reason to believe that the Doctor tricked them into making the human race kill the entire species on every planet, and the fact that plenty of them were around later, my prediction is that ""the promise"" is going to be a mystery that gets forgotten.

I miss the headless monks, too. They came, acted mysterious, and were forgotten. What did they want? What was their purpose? We'll never know.

Hell, the Doctor wasn't supposed to go to Trenzalore because it was impossible for him to refuse to answer a question, or to lie, and ""what is your name?"" is a really significant question. We get there, and the question is actually ""what is the password to the TARDIS?"" and apparently ""I won't say"" is acceptable, especially if someone else knows and says it off-screen.

The Master was taken in by Wilston-Croft, and inherited his house when Wilston-Croft died.

At the end of the allotted time, the Doctor duly arrived but strove to avoid fulfilling his side of the bargain. The Master became aware of the Doctor's role in pledging him to Death as her servant but forgave him for it. Death herself was present, disguised as the Master's maid, and manipulated events so that the John Smith persona would crumble and the true Master become dominant once more.""

I mean, character wise he has always had a dark side. He will punish people severely and walk away, they may burden his conscience but I cannot conceive what a man capable of this would be so ashamed of he would deny the existence of an entire aspect of himself. He even conceded that what was done was necessary and yet the unknown act is still the most abhorrent thing  ever done by one of his incarnations.

true,Cold_Kneeling,null,null,"But this one did seem to have more links to Gallifreyan time machines than normal - for one thing, the Doctor describes the one seen in the Lodger as ""someone's attempt to build a TARDIS"", which although from an in-story perspective could just be the Doctor's assumption/him just so used to his method of time travel that he refers to all time ships as TARDISes, but from a narrative, out-of-story perspective I took it as natural to assume that was a piece of information offered to the audience that it wasn't just any old time machine. Also you must admit it looked very much like the TARDIS control room.

Basically, I assumed that would go somewhere, but then again you are perfectly correct, so it's possible Moffat left that there as something he could develop if he wanted to, but decided to just stick with the significance of it just being that it was abandoned (because then later the Doctor says something like ""I suppose we're about to find out why that time machine was abandoned"" or something - don't have that ep so I can't check the genuine quote, sorry :/). Because, as you mentioned, lots of races have time travel then it doesn't *have* to be expanded upon, just could be.

I'm kind of tired, let me know if this makes absolutely no sense. What I'm trying to say is I saw definite TARDIS links with the Silence's machine and was expecting that to develop into the plot, but it's possible that was a 'just in case' measure, or even just so that the audience got that it was a Time Machine, and it doesn't *have* to go anywhere because of what you pointed it out.

I think the wording of this exchange is very important.  You'll notice how The Doctor is understanding of the action but not of how it was attributed.

&gt; I never would... have you got that? I. Never. Would. When you start this new world... this world of human and Hath... remember that! Make the foundation of this society a man who never would!

-The Tenth Doctor (The Doctor's Daughter S4 E6)

Since the show returned whenever The Doctor has faced enemies or forces of evil he has been all about giving them a choice, letting them see the error of their ways and change for the better and in doing so setting an example for all that there is a better way, an enlightened way.   The Doctor's way.

Should you persist in performing acts of evil rather than walk away then The Doctor won't have to do anything to you, it's not his place to, rather your actions will come back to haunt you.

Certainly The Doctor sets things up in such a way that they end up being hung by their own petard but ultimately it is them that pushes the button or pulls the trigger that seals their fates.  It's a thin, grey line he walks but it is one that he stays on the lighter side of.

That is not to say that The Doctor hasn't come dangerously close to crossing that line.  The Ninth Doctor's actions in Dalek (S1 E6)) or the lives he saved out of spite for the laws of time at Bowie Base One (The Waters of Mars.)

Both times it was not for the greater good but to satisfy a selfish need but someone was there to pull him back or make him realise that he had gone too far.

Here is what I think John Hurt's Doctor did.  Something happened, quite possibly the discovery of what the Timelords were planning to do in order to end the Time War, something so horrific that he consulted his previous selves. They decided that the best course of action was to use The Moment and seal the Time War behind the Time Lock not, however without offering amnesty to the many innocent lives trapped in the war.  

For an unknown purely selfish, personal reason The War Doctor used The Moment without giving those non combatants or conscientious objectors the chance to get out first , forever dooming many, many innocent lives to be trapped in the Time War.

The other Doctors, still in psychic contact with him, are so disgusted by this that they force him to regenerate into the Ninth Doctor and disavow The War Doctor's very existence. 

An act intended to bring peace and sanity to time and space became a selfish act of cowardice or hatred perhaps.  Whatever the reason it was to satisfy a personal need.

You also have to realize that I didn't say maturity level anywhere in what I said. A person is far more than maturity they exhibit and you also have to realize that the doctor has been through things and times in his life that without a doubt give him the leeway to act like a ""goofy kid."" I also have a theory about his current regenerations specifically becoming goofy because of how bad it was during the time war, so theres that.

Jack is plenty grown, by human standards. But even so, we are talking 800 years here if we take what the doctor has said as close to his real age. That is far more time than you are giving credit for.

Therefore, if the timeline in the Doctor's tomb was a manifestation of the Doc's timeline (I am assuming that it was built somehow and isn't an entirely natural creation), then it could only have been built based on the records.

true,mmofan,null,null,"God knows at this rate, I can only do one episode. I want to emphasize very long time. As this is my first time at this, so it's likely there will be a new Doctor by the time I'm done. Please don't hold your breath, this is a very painstaking process, and I can be a perfectionist with something like this, so it will be a while. I am guessing it will take me between 6 months and a year, as I am not going to be working on it full time. As I get better with the software, however, that could change.

Right now I am in the process of getting various locations, characters, and object color schemes down. Any suggestions are welcome.

I haven't decided yet whether I will release bits and pieces or the entire thing all at once, and I am sure the BBC will want to sue me, so I will have to find a way to release it to watch, but not download. I will probably at least show one scene so people see how it's going.  I will not be charging for this, as I don't own it. The process is frame by frame, spline by spline, one object at a time (tie, shirt, face, etc.).

For those interested, one shot can take up to one to two hours, and that might even be just for one character's body.

If anyone has any questions, feel free to fire away.

The episode I am working on is The Mind Robbers Ep 1.

I understand that there will be some purists who this will really upset. If anything, this is for me, so I can see what it would have been like to see the Doctor in color. To those offended, I apologize.

true,Cold_Kneeling,null,null,"I really disagree with that last point - RTD loved the device of killing important characters for giving the episode a certain tone or showing how dangerous an enemy was. Examples off the top of my head include Astrid, Lance, Yvonne Hartman, Sir Robert, Rickey... He avoided killing most the big continuous characters because it's supposed to be amazingly rare for a companion/the Doctor to die (well, maybe 'supposed to be' is the wrong phrase, I mean that narratively it carries more weight if it's rare and it was a rare occurrence in the classic series), but he certainly didn't shy away from a dramatic death if the plot needed it and I think the only characters he brought back to life were Pete Tyler (sort of), Mickey's gran (again, sort of), Tom Milligan and the gas mask zombies. I may be wrong, please enlighten me if I am :). But I agree with OP, funnythingsmustdie etc. that Moffat is less decisive about killing off important characters than RTD was and I personally feel the story and the emotion of the deaths lose something because of it.

The Doctor time locks the end of the Time War, so no one can go back and change it, and kills all of the Time Lords and Daleks. Between the time lock and the thing that kills them, the Time Lords, as we saw, figure out a way to get one small object out of the time lock, and use it to pull the rest of Gallifrey out, through the Master. Even though they ended up in a time occupied by a later version of the Doctor, it was the same day (for them) as when they found out the Doctor was going to kill them all, but right before it happened. So it this part: ""(--"" They can't try again, because they basically used up all the time they had left, and failed. They've been long dead, the Doctor just didn't know that they *almost* got out, until he saw it for himself later. They don't have infinite time within the time lock, they had one day.

Moffat was also reluctant to kill characters when he wrote one-off episodes. TEC/TDD actually ends with one *less* corpse than it began with. 

The only real difference between them in this respect is that Moffat extends this unlikeliness to die to minor characters and even extras and background characters. RTD killed someone in nearly every episode, and it was honestly overused (and Moffat's death-free stories were a breath of fresh air). It just never happened to a main character.

There is a balance of deaths to be had, and they both miss the balance, one on either side of it.

The importance of the name or the part about that ""when no creature can speak falsely or fail to answer"" (and ""the fall of the Eleventh"" thing) may be exaggerated oder simply translated wrong (""silence will fall"" vs. ""silence must fall"" anyone?). My theory:

The Silence tried to kill The Doctor before he reaches Trenzalore and they failed - he went there twice (one time to break into his own tomb and the second time when he met his demise). And because of that, because The Doctor survived Lake Silencio and died on Trenzalore, it was possible for the Great Intelligence to enter the timestream of The Doctor - and silence fell (the scene when Vastra ran out and the stars went out). 

Someone already pointed Davros and the Reality Bomb out - but what about Rassilon's plan to destroy everything to end the Time War? Vastra said it: ""The universe without The Doctor - there will be consequences!""

Maybe The Silence really tried to save the universe. And maybe after trying to kill him and realizing that it won't work, they (or a splinter group or someone else) decided to help The Doctor instead, keep his legacy intact - and created Clara.

So the importance of the name of The Doctor was really only the password which protected the timestream of The Doctor. And someone had to answer - The Doctor COULDN'T because he realized what would happen and what would be the consequences. But River couldn't allow him to sacrifice his friends, so... she answered and spoke true.

Well, the Great Stupidity still knew about him.

Eh, I see your point. Maybe the Silence (organization) didn't die, they just never existed. However, I never expected that particular problem to be solved in such a weak way.

They go from a huge threat to ""the Doctor is a deity who can erase all references to himself"", then he's back to not knowing a damned thing about any of his enemies.

If he's powerful and smart enough to cause the Silence to stop existing because they've never heard of him, he shouldn't be so ignorant the rest of the time.

I've never been a big fan of ""the entire universe is in danger"" as a plot, and it's never handled well.

The only reason I still watch the show is that most episodes are stand-alone stories, and are still good, as long as you ignore the 30 seconds of ""remember the universe is in danger"" at the end.

&gt; Granted, we've just always assumed the Silence was the name of the race as well.

I thought that had been officially confirmed.

And considering their magic power, they're a race that's only visible by the consequences of their actions, not directly. So I can see how the name works.

Where your client's instructions are that a witness is lying, you have to put that to them forcefully, test their credibility, and try to trip them up.  It would be dereliction of duty not to do so.  If you were ever to find yourself on the wrong end of an accusation you would demand and expect someone to do the same for you.  Obviously, for a police officer, being called a liar in open court goes with the territory, and, whilst it may be annoying or even a bit upsetting, it's part of the job (and the judge will remember it when sentencing if the jury don't believe the defendant and s/he is convicted).  It's very different for the victim of a crime, for whom the court experience is novel and intimidating enough, doubly so if a violent crime, triply so if they are a vulnerable adult or a child.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Well, prophecies can be unaccurate and misleading.

But if you're going for that approach, then why the fuck would you bother having a prophecy in the first place?

""Everyone lies, everything is false, and nothing means anything"" is weak storytelling.

&gt; And someone had to answer - The Doctor COULDN'T because he realized what would happen and what would be the consequences. But River couldn't allow him to sacrifice his friends, so... she answered and spoke true.

Yet they waffled for a bit and then let Clara sacrifice herself to save him.

You could argue that it wasn't a true sacrifice because she didn't die. But, well, ""person sacrifices themselves for the grater good"" is actually better than ""person suffers mild inconvenience for the greater good"".

That, and the whole ""no living creature can lie or refuse to answer"" thing turned out to be more bullshit.

&gt; Vastra said it: ""The universe without The Doctor - there will be consequences!""

Exactly - consequences matter to a story.

&gt; Maybe The Silence really tried to save the universe. And maybe after trying to kill him and realizing that it won't work, they (or a splinter group or someone else) decided to help The Doctor instead, keep his legacy intact - and created Clara.

Nah.

Clara bad-wolf'd herself into existence. By jumping into the thingy, she made herself the ""impossible girl"" who would be picked up in time to jump into the thingy.

Moffat loves paradoxes that would fit in Bill and Ted better than classic Who. I don't expect any deeper explanation.

You'll notice I said nothing about Levy destroying the club, he has in general done a great job. He's not perfect though and I certainly don't think he's quite the legend that bullshit meme posts like this one make him out to be.

What I did say is that having faith in Levy signing us a striker makes you either an idiot or someone who hasn't experienced the crushing pessimism of another window going by without it happening for four years now; opportunity after opportunity to solidify our status at the top end of the league passing us by as affordable strikers are snapped up all over Europe before going on to bang in the goals that could have seen us a regular in the CL since we first qualified.

Regarding Remy: he's a quality striker, has regularly started for a strong French national team with a host of other options over the last couple of years and would have been a good buy, even at the top of our wage structure.

The fact he got injured is neither here nor there. Nor is the way he scored his goals - he's shown countless times he can score from all sorts of situations, the fact QPR's generally shitness meant his only opportunities came on the break this season doesn't mean he's not capable of more.

But all that is really besides the point; it's about far more than Remy. It's about Ba and Cisse and Benteke and Sow and Yilmaz and Sturridge and Negredo and Soldado and Bony and Gomis and all the other affordable forwards that other clubs have shown us are available and good enough to have helped us step up a level.

My thoughts:

Doctor Who Season 7 finale: thoughts and review

Bottom Line: Did not like. Too many plot wholes, too much pointless buildup that doesn’t get solved. Typical Moffat “Here’s a nonsolution and introduction to another huge mystery that will never get solved.” Dr. Who needs a new head writer.

First of all, the name of the episode is “The Name of the Doctor” or some other rubbish like that, leading many people to believe we would actually be learning his name. Foolish humans.  Moffat never tells us anything. OF COURSE WE DON’T LEARN HIS NAME.

But I didn’t really expect that, so that didn’t really bother me.

The Good (*spoilers*)

Once they finally get to the climax, I was more or less on board. When the, admittedly somewhat random villain, basically infiltrates the Doctors timeline to kill him I was kinda like, “hell yea, this is cool.” But, upon further reflection of about 3 seconds, it didn’t really make sense. Why does he have to kill him over and over again, why not just once… at the very beginning of his life. Whatevs.

I think the time stream could have been used much differently and more interstingly. It could have been the launch for a whole season of trying to track down the villain. Instead, that problem was solved within seconds. Geez Moffat.

Then Clara does her thing and I thought that was kind of an interesting way to resolve the problem of the villain and explain Clara being around in previous time lines. Although… it kinda makes her too important. I mean, she’s the one who tells the Doctor which TARDIS to pick? C’mon. 

Yea… that’s pretty much all I have to say about the good. What the villain did in the end was cool, and what Clara did was cool. Except it doesn’t really show her saving the Doctor from the villain. Like… at all. We’re meant to believe he’s all over time and space killing the doctor and we never see it.

The Bad

River. Screw you River Song. I have a long history of hating River, but I kinda expected her to show up. She’s Moffat’s go to for finales and also for solving impossible plot holes. Just insert River Song and viola, any plot problem you’re having is easily fixed.

But, there she was. I actively tried to keep my cool. For the first minute or so she wasn’t being so annoyingly River. But then we’re taken to the fields of Trenszalore or what have you (by the way, not sure how they do it in the U.K., but I feel like this episode could have really used a “previously on Dr. Who…” kind of opening. I mean, they were bringing up things from YEARS worth of the show. How about a little reminder for people who might not be superfans, or for people who might be relatively new to the whole Whoniverse.

Alright, so we get to the planet where the Doctor is supposed to have died, or where he’s buried. We see a gravestone with River’s name on it and Clara is all like “she can’t be dead, I was just talking to her.” What? You’re a time traveler, and you just did some pretty hefty time traveling, so maybe River died in the meantime? You’re standing right next to the Doctor, and yet you are also standing on the planet where he possibly died and is buried… so what’s the big deal seeing a gravestone.

So, then we learn that this is that *other* version of River. The one from when we first met her, the one trapped in a computer program. This is what I mean about this episode needing a “previously on…”, that episode where River was killed and then trapped in the computer aired almost 5 years ago.

Oh look, this computer version of River can only be seen by Clara, and OF COURSE she knows a secret passage into the Doctors gravestone! That’s what she’s here for afterall, cheater of all plot holes.  She can do whatever she wants. Because spoilers.

The Villain: So, then the villains are trying to get into the Doctors tomb and he’s refusing. His friends are in danger and he’s still refusing. So… River lets them in. WHY RIVER, WHY DID YOU DO THAT? So then, the villain, the Great Intelligence, who for some reason is posing as a dead Doctor Simeon or whoever his name is spelled, goes in and enters the Doctors timeline in everyway. He endangers all of time and space by doing this. So again, I ask… WHY DID RIVER LET THEM IN IF IT’S SO DANGEROUS?

But, like I said. What the villain did was pretty cool. Then Clara does what she does to save the Doctor. But.. we don’t really see her protect the Doctor from the Great Intelligence… do we? We just see her appear from time to time. I also don’t like that this makes Clara, basically the most important person ever. Seems like all of Moffat’s companions are like this, the most important person EVER. 

Sure, you could point to Rose and being Bad Wolf, but that only happened what? Once? This is the ultimate Bad Wolf. Rose just wrote it down throughout time and then used her powers to defeat the Daleks. Clara literally spread herself throughout the doctors entire timeline. Clara is the most important person ever, River is the most important person ever, Amy was super important. Whatever happened to companions who were just… a know. Fun companions, not super galactic mysterious?

The End

We’re meant to believe that Clara died and spread different versions of herself all throughout time and space to save the Doctor… oh but whats this? She’s alive and well in some kind of…. place? And the Doctor spreads himself all over time and space through his own timeline (the ultimate timeline crossing, to go along with the ultimate Bad Wolf) and he winds up in the same place as Clara.

He makes a lot of noise about a name, and a promise, and then a mysterious person appears with a nice title card that says “Introducing John Hurt as … The Doctor”. thanks mysterious title card writer. What the fuck was that? Jeebus.  That was weird and annoying.

It's been a trend since Eccelston's Doctor that he's had some serious violence and rage issues; Tennant's was more passive, but it still came out (case in point: Family of Blood, Waters of Mars), and Smith's Doctor comes off almost resigned to this trend at times. This is, perhaps, coping with this decision to take what the Doctor would consider the ""easy way out"", and just scorch earth on Gallifrey and the rest of the space in the Time Lock. It'd explain many of the habits seen since the reboot in 2005, especially with Eccelston's Doctor (""Just this once everybody lives"" comes to mind).

true,jbddit,tardis,TARDIS,"""The Eleventh Hour"" was my first full episode. I had seen bits of ""Rose"" and ""Blink"" before, but never the entire episodes.

So by the time I sat down and watched ""The Eleventh Hour,"" which was with a whole bunch of Whovian friends of mine that were delightfully curious about the new Doctor that was being introduced with the episode, I had already known a bit about Doctor Who. I had seen brief glimpses of those previous eps from my Whovian friends, who had tried diligently to get me to watch the series, because they thought I would love it a lot. I always fancied the premise, but I'm not much of a television person a lot of the time.

I really liked Matt Smith's performance and I obviously think he's my first Doctor, despite being the most recent and current one (which loses me cred points among long-time fans, I suppose, though I notice the Doctor Who community doesn't seem to be quite as prickly about that sort of thing).

It was just 3 months ago that I sat down on Netflix and ran from Eccleston straight through Series 6, and then managed to catch up to series 7 eventually, so I've seen all of modern Who literally in the last third of a year and have established myself as a fan. I'm quite in love with the show now, it has soared to probably the highest spot of my favorite interests.

He is ashamed of it, but the repercussions have been dealt with. 

Maybe John Hurt's Doctor was a regeneration between 8 and 9, but I doubt his shameful act has to do with ending the Time War. It might involve the Time War somehow.

Another theory could be that John Hurt's Doctor was involved in the destruction of the Galaxy mentioned in Nightmare in Silver. It's a long shot, but destroying an entire galaxy to end the Cyberman threat could be considered an act of necessity, something done in the name of sanity and something that the Doctor would be very ashamed of. It's very anti-Doctor, but there might have been no other choice.

I think it's far more likely, however, that it's something we've never heard of before. If it involved the Time War, I'll be both disappointed and intrigued.

Regardless of my mistake though, the point still stand that you do not have to be unemployed in order to receive housing benefits in which you were confused about.

It would also benefit you greatly to not take such an outlook on life in regards to welfare. Anybody is capable of falling on hardship, certainly in the current climate. Thus playing coy with what the government offers in ways of aid only hampers your wellbeing in the possible future. 

It may appear hypocritical to now lecture you on learning what welfare is offered after being incorrect on an aspect of a new reform.

Like the long term effects of living in space and what it does to the DNA in the cell? Does the loss of bone density and muscle have epigenetic effects where genes to produce those things are switched off temporarily?
Does increased radiation and the such like have a profound effect on cancer risks? Fertility? How stable is DNA in zero gravity?

true,symbiosychotic,null,null,"It actually describes what we saw fairly well.  Consider the situation...  The Doctor arrives at Trenzalore (the battle ""fields"" of Trenzalore) in his TARDIS, which refuses to descend.  He shuts off the anti-grav and plummets to the surface.  Yes, the Doctor has ""fallen"" many times, but aside from the word ""Fall"" being something that could be used in so many ways (a fall from grace, a physical stumble, etc) we see him accomplish exactly what it describes in context - ""Oh the fields of Trenzalore at the fall of the 11th"".  11 fell the fields of Trenzalore.  Going forward it describes ""when no living creature can speak falsely or fail to answer, a Question will be asked, a question that must never, ever be answered.""

The scenario was set up so that of those alive (only the Doctor's crew, as the Whispermen and GI don't entirely count as living, nor River for that matter), the Doctor had no real choice in the matter.  He was placed in a situation where if he didn't answer, or answered falsely, then bad things would be happen, things that he (due to his code) would not allow.  He (by his own morality) would HAVE to answer, and truthfully, so that the door would open if he wanted to avoid the result (Whispermen killing his friends).  There's no magical statement saying he DOES answer, only that he be placed into a situation where he can not speak falsely or fail to answer.  He was placed in that situation.  It doesn't matter that ultimately someone else answered and he ""didn't"" because barring any intervention, he ultimately would have answered.  He would not allow everyone to die to prevent it (if so, he would never have gone in the first place).  So the situation was set up correctly - he could not lie or refuse to answer.  Thus the question was asked (to access the door).  It also doesn't say the question does not get answered, just that it is a question that must never be answered, a warning of the consequences of doing so.

Also, while its cool to see the parallelism of the TARDIS window being damaged very similarly on both versions, they are actually exactly reversed of one another in terms of the crack itself.

The acceptance of today does not apply.  It is odd enough that the great detective is a woman, if it became known that the two were lesbian lovers, it would cause issues.

In the time, lesbianism was not illegal (male homosexual acts were), and was somewhat tolerated, but only if it was either kept secret, or the attempt to keep it secret was made.  Essentially the public at large wanted plausible deniability.  Lesbianism was actually not that uncommon, but it was always private and hidden.

So the two have a strict code of conduct that they must maintain.  They exist in society in a well respected position.  They are clearly affluent, but not of the nobility.  That is a precarious social position, and a scandal could easily topple them and lead to some rather unpleasant things.

the doctor mentions at least a dozen times that the tardis was a warship of his people, the only way he could of taken part of the time war and ended it would've been if he already had the tardis. so him ending the time war cant be the Doctors secret since he already had the name doctor.

The [Valeyard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valeyard) is a fictional character from the long-running British science fiction television series, Doctor Who. He is described as an amalgamation of the Doctor from between his twelfth and final incarnations.

You can start with 'Rose' (the beginning of the 'New' Doctor Who series) or jump back to the Tom Baker days where the series soared to new heights before the re-invention or I know a lot of people strongly recommend starting with the episode 'Blink' and moving forward til the end of that season then going back to 'Rose' and moving forward since the look of those episodes can sometimes turn off new fans (that kind of matte-like early 90s look).

Personally, I started watching with 'Rose' when I was sick at home one day and then just powered through, then I went and hunted down the new episodes after that to get up to date, then watched all the 'Classic Who' on Netflix and then hunted down all the classic episodes, and then the more obscure things like the movies, animated movies, audio-books, and novels. 

For you, having watched all of season 7b and that's it, I would say take it in steps. I don't know that the first half of this season has much to offer outside the very first episode (Dalek Asylum) and the Christmas Special. So if you want to complete your Clara exposure you can start with those, but I think it might lead to more questions than it answers due to the different characters and focus. My best advice would be to start with season five, episode one (The Eleventh Hour) because it is the start of the current incarnation of the Doctor and then watch up until now. After that, go back and start with season one of the 'New Who' and catch back up again. After that, go where ever the time winds take you.

**TL;DR** There's no right answer, but I think it would be good for you to watch all of this Doctor (Season 5 through Present) then go back and watch all of New Who (Season 1 from 2005).",0,1369020967,null,0,false,0,ca2546f,t3_1eo64e,t1_ca2546f,t3_1eo64e,null,1431099813,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

He very likely isn't the real Doctor in any sense so much as an alternate reality sort of Doctor created by the Dark Matrix. So The Valeyard's activities will likely be going on simultaneously to twelfth/thirteenth's life times. There's also been plenty of discussion about rather or not we are still bound to any of that canon (including the limit of thirteen lives and if The Valeyard will even come to be) due to the time locking of Gallifrey and the Last Great Time War. I know it was mentioned in the episode, but bear in mind that Clara was also able to recall information from time lines that never were due to the deep dimensionality happening in the depths of the TARDIS (where GI is when he makes the speech). Being pure energy/information and being exposed to those depths of the TARDIS, the writers could easily explain away his statements as referring to information about universes that were erased or never came to be.

(PS: But damned if I wouldn't love to get some Valeyard action going on in the near future. Not only is that kind of Dark Doctor an awesome concept (I mean, look how people are obsessing about Hurt or Mr. Clever), but also because The Valeyard was also known as Jack the Ripper for a while. Vastra mentioned that she killed Jack the Ripper. The more opportunities for Vastra, Jenny, and Strax episodes the happier a Whovian I become.)

For Just one scene. I have to create a mask for each item. Face, shirt, wall, shoe, whatever. So, let's say I am doing the Doctor's face. I have to make a mask. Then, every frame he moves, I have to physically adjust the mask as not to interfere with the environment. So, scenes with a lot of movement are the pain right now. Then I have to do it frame by frame for the shirt, the bow tie, you get the picture.

My biggest pain right now (and maybe I don't understand timelines) is turning masks on and off, and maintining opacity, etc. I think I am doing pretty good for having gotten the program yesterday, but probably a lot of things I'm doing the hard way.

It's also weird, it almost feels like AE starts anticipating and moves mask points for me, but I'm not sure how to encourage it to do so, so that all I have to do is fine adjustments. 

**EDIT:** Man, you are a lifesaver. I'm going to look more into rotobrush. I've been doing everything by hand.

&gt;Russell T Davies noted how firmly the concept of limiting Time Lords to thirteen lives, introduced in The Deadly Assassin, was lodged in fans' minds. Davies deliberately broke the limit in Death of the Doctor, though he admits that fandom may resist his attempt to alter the programme's mythos.

&gt;When they came [to America] to launch The Eleventh Hour, I went along to this screening in LA and journalists put their hands up, and one of the first questions was, ""What will happen when he reaches the thirteenth regeneration?"" There's a fascinating academic study to be made out of how some facts stick and some don't – how Jon Pertwee's Doctor could say he was thousands of years old, and no-one listens to that, and yet someone once says he’s only got thirteen lives, and it becomes lore. It's really interesting, I think. That's why I’m quite serious that that 507 thing won't stick, because the 13 is too deeply ingrained in the public consciousness. But how? How did that get there?

For the making mask and moving it for every frame, it's called rotoscoping, and there's two easy ways to do this (among other ways) which is via the rotobrush and mocha AE for the more difficult tracking. 

Mocha AE needs a bit of learning and getting used to, but damn, it can track things better than anything I've ever seen. That is, it can see where the objects are moving from frame to frame much better than anything.

Rotobrush is more intuitive and it's built-in to AE.

You're doing great. Just keep doing it and you'll get better as you use the tools more often. :D

true,thatguyfromcanada,pertwee,Pertwee,"My two cents: The JH Doctor is an aged meta-crisis tenth doctor. This would give more credibility to what Hurt said about playing in a sort of ""trinity"" of Doctors with Smith and Tenant. We know that he was exiled with Rose to Pete's World so that with Rose, he could learn to control his impulses for violence/vengeance/justice at whatever cost. There is a deleted scene wherein some TARDIS ""coral"" is left for the Pete's World Doc, so that he can grow his own TARDIS within a human lifetime. Maybe this is what he does, and what could contribute to his aged look. Perhaps this Doctor, filled with guilt and guided by his human impulsiveness/passion (He was able to say ""I love you"" to Rose, after all),  attempts to right the wrongs that he had committed in the Time War, or perhaps to undo it outright, only to find that there are larger moral/ethical implications or perhaps to find that his actions caused a past version of himself to enter the time war, creating a bootstrap paradox, rendering himself responsible for both the beginning and the end of the time war, many more lives lost that he is directly responsible for than he had previously thought. This is also perhaps why Clara didn't see this Doctor while in the Doctor's time stream. As 11 said ""He is me"", but this could give credence to the fact that while the JH doctor did emerge out of a regeneration of the tenth, and is for all intents and purposes ""The Doctor"", he isn't a direct continuation or legitimate regeneration of The Doctor. Just my two cents. BONUS: Maybe JH is wearing Nine's jacket because it reminds him of the incarnation he inhabited when he first met Rose. Probably incredibly wrong, but this would be a great way to connect Tenant and Smith's Doctors/eras, while still remaining sympathetic to Eccleston's tenure (I.e. as a lot of people are predicting ""JH Doctor is the 'Real' ninth doctor, etc."" Really excited to see how the next series plays out.

true,King-Hell,eng-sussex,Brighton,"I think the pay increase should be more than £10,000. I think we should roughly double the salary of MPs to about £120,000, plus expenses.
But for that they have to give up any outside paid work. It's a no-brainer that allowing our lawmakers to be paid twice for making decisions leads to a conflict of interests. We pay them a salary from the public purse to make laws and govern the country on behalf of their constituents, then they get paid again by a special-interest group to ignore the voters, common sense, and the best interests of the country, and vote in favour of something dreadful. You only have to look at the way the debate on fracking is being corrupted by MPs making the decisions while taking consultancy fees from the oil industry.
Why should our MPs be any different from our judges, who are forbidden to accept any fees or gifts of any kind? Judges are paid a very good salary and are provided with a house and housekeeper and chauffeur and all the rest. The logic is simple; give this small group of people more money than they need and they won't be tempted to take kickbacks.
But our politicians are leading a double life. You would think that being an MP would be a full-time job. It certainly is for my own MP Caroline Lucas. She even gave up leadership of the Green party because it took too much time out of her parliamentary duties.
Yet there are MPs who treat Parliament like it's a part-time hobby. They contribute nothing to debates, and they do nothing for their constituents. Much of their time is spent providing consultancy services for corporations and lobbying on their behalf, or swanning around the world on some corporate junket.
So let's pay our MPs a salary that all of us would aspire to earning. Yes, we want the best people to do the job. Yes, they should be paid for their talents and their hard work. And £120K isn't really that much – there are senior teachers that make that much.
But it should be illegal for a serving MP to accept any money at all above their salary. I'm sure the crafty ones will still find a way to get around that, but it's a start.",0,1369024223,null,0,1369036206,0,ca264o7,t3_1emkl8,t1_ca264o7,t3_1emkl8,null,1431099337,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

I didn't mean to minimize the importance of any minor characters that died in earlier plotlines. My main point is that some of that time travel / timey wimey bits were present originally with RTD, like with Rose bouncing through universes or with the occasional cameos. I do agree that I think this only works with some characters, and that some characters really should just stay dead or at least permanently out of the Doctor's life.

I think Moffat may be falling into the habit of leaving storylines open in case either another writer picked it up or if he could later use a character. I don't know if I totally agree with this, and I agree that it takes away from the emotional reaction.

Imagine what stories could be told with a half-timelord hybrid wife at the Doctors side at certain points. And you don't need to keep the same actress because she can regenerate too.

Then what irks me is ""Silence MUST fall when The Question is asked."" because no one ""can fail to answer on the fields of Tranzelore"". Oh no, it's just a normal question because the Doctor's name opens a door that should never be openened.
Ooh look, it's open. (And in fact, the Name is not all that special because he chose the name of ""Doctor"".)
As opposed to the worked up arc that the name of the doctor will remember all the bad guys of how dangerous he is. 
Clara/Dalek: ""We've become stronger in fear of you.""

true,Stormwatch36,cyberman,Cyberperson,"&gt;That's a good point, but he couldn't have ""broken the promise"" if he hadn't taken the name Doctor yet.

Who said Hartnell was the one who picked his name? All we know is that the Eleventh does not consider him worthy of the title, since he broke the promise. Clara said she had seen every face from *the day he started running* up to Trenzalore. I'm going to take this opportunity to spell out what we know about Doctor Hurt, along with a couple of my own theories sprinkled in:

1. He is a secret. This one is obvious, but the implications of it are escaping people. Hurt won't be the Valeyard, because the Valeyard is not a secret. The Great Intelligence knew of him, and his entire plan was getting The Doctor's secret. I'm pretty sure the GI was smart enough to know if he accidentally put what he was after in the discard pile, so to speak.

2. Eleven recognizes Hurt to the point of being ashamed of him. This throws all the 'repressed regeneration' theories straight out the window. Eleven is well aware of Hurt's existence, thus we can assume any Doctors that came after his creation also know.

3. The Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Doctors have always fully (albiet painfully) accepted the end of the Time War as their own doing. Thus, Hurt was probably not the one to use the moment. This goes back to point one as well. What happened during the Time War isn't a secret. The Doctor has willfully told companions all about it, even sitting Martha down at the end of Gridlock for a real explanation of the details. Hurt couldn't have started it either, since various people (RTD most notably) have directly said that Four's actions in Genesis of the Daleks were the first blow of the Time War. All of this basically means that the Time War is not a secret, thus I doubt that Hurt had anything to do with it directly. This brings me to:

4. The 50th Anniversary will *probably* be at least somewhat related to the Time War. After all, why wouldn't it be? Aside from the season 5 TARDIS explosion, the Time War is the only remaining open plot line to work with. Given that the 50th is a direct ""to be continued"" from Name of the Doctor, we now know that it will definitely not stand 100% on its own and it will utilize open plotlines to some degree. Thus, my theory is that Hurt somehow stumbles into some information about the future of the Time Lords before he's supposed to have it.

5. Hurt did something so despicable that the Doctor isn't willing to attribute it directly to himself. Compared to destroying the entire rest of his species, what could Hurt possibly have done? Well... what made The Doctor run away from Gallifrey in the first place? It must have really been something else if it made him grab only his granddaughter and go hide out in a junkyard on Earth in the 1960's. I believe it's related to Hurt having knowledge of the Time War and attempting to do something about it *before* he ran away.",0,1369033141,null,0,1369033748,0,ca287az,t3_1ena11,t1_ca287az,t1_ca25rcs,null,1431098287,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

true,pbwra,present,Oscar,"I would be interested to see how many fans who think Rafa did such an amazing job have supported the club for more than 5 years. i.e. were here when JM was manager. 

For the record I think he was ok, and thank him for his professionalism. I don't think he walked into a club that was in a terrible position, a 'shitty situation' as so many people seem to want to put it. When people say that I think that they are just parroting Daily Mail/ESPN articles, Ian Wright commentary, and /r/soccer. 

Carlo in his first season did a fantastic job (second season slump was arguably a breakdown over Ray's sacking) though his CL performances were a bit dissapointing. Jose in all three full seasons did a fantastic job both at home and in Europe. Hiddink was excellent in his short tenure. Scolari was shit. AVB made a lot of mistakes, Rafa did ok. RDM motivated the players well but was not always great tactically. Grant did nothing but let the players run the club (which was fine at the time because it was still Jose's team). Rafa by comparison with Scolari, RDM, AVB and Grant was fair to good. Rafa by comparison to Jose, Carlo (1st season esp. but even 2nd), and Hiddink was quite substandard.

Quite a few people in here seem either unaware of the club's stated objectives or think it's just a bit of bluster. At the time of Roman's take over we had a stated aim to become the *best club in the world*. Jose showed that our club can do this and that is why people are dissatisfied. Our squad now lacks *some* of the depth that it had then, but the quality of player is almost certainly higher. Players like Didier, Frank, JT, Cech, were promising players - not superstars. Carvalho and Ferreira were the only players who had actually won a big title when they came here at the time (actually Maka may have as well, can't recall at the minute). This club with this squad should perform much better than it has over the last 3 years, and to accept less is to disconnect with the clubs goals and aspirations and will cause you to fail to understand the decisions of Roman and the board. 

Sorry that was a bit of a rant, I'm just home after a friends birthday and have had a couple. I just really don't understand this attitude that a manager who was a European champion can be handed one of the most expensive and highest man-for-man quality squads in the history of the sport, under perform drastically against teams with less than a tenth of the budget and be profusely congratulated for scraping through to the minimum set of objectives he was given. 

Edit: And to be perfectly clear I would like to add that I am not intending to call people out over the length of their support, I am an international fan and I am really happy with the growth in the fanbase. I also only started supporting Chelsea when I got interested in football during Euro 2004. It was just my personal curiosity as to whether that was the underlying cause for thinking he had done so well.

true,Icanhazcomment,present,Jimmy Zola Lampard Drogba Cech and many other lads,"Our team is not designed for any striker to bang in all the goals. You have to remember than we are using a different strategy which is why I find most of the Ba and Torres criticism annoying. It is also the reason why I would suggest not calling back Lukaku until we get our system down in place. Yes they might miss an easy chance here and there but they are good strikers, the team just isn't geared towards them and that is not a bad thing.

Before I explain this point further heres a stat for you. Our midfielders and even defenders have scored more goals this season than the strikers. Why is it?

This is because we play a sort of a false 9 tactic but our 9 is not a midfielder he is a striker. This set up is designed for goals to come from all over the pitch instead of just one player. A team using a false 9 system tends to have goals spread out throughout the team especially the midfield and not dependant on any one player or a striker. We still use a striker but that is why Torres has been so much more successful because Ba is that 1 man outfront styled player while Torres loves playing the role of switching to the wings and dropping back. He is therefore a striker which has adjusted himself for the false 9 system so we don't need a midfielder in his place. This is the reason both Torres and Ba seem to drift out on the wings and become wingers mid game, our formation is designed for a false 9 system with players barging in from all over the pitch instead of strikers scoring from crosses etcetera which is the traditional system.

When Drogba left we gave up the traditional system. People have been saying every season that this is Chelsea's transition period but when it happened right infront of them this season they didn't notice it and instead started judging the strikers to the traditional way. This year was the biggest transition in Chelsea's recent history. The entire squad and playing style was refreshed and redesigned.

So is it a good or a bad thing? 

It is a great thing IMO. We have players who can still get the goals and break even the most stubborn teams in this way as you no longer have 1 player to rely on. We also have goal scorers on every part of the pitch this way for example all of Mata, Oscar, Hazard, Torres, Ramires, Lampard heck Cahill, Terry, Ivanovic can score goals. 

Just to show you how good we are at adjusting to this change, betting on the next goal scorer for Chelsea is one of the most difficult things to do as you never know where the goal will come from. In other teams its RVP, Suarez etcetera, that one player from which everything channels through but that is not how team functions so comparing our strikers to their tactics is just plain useless and annoying.

This is the reason Sturridge was great at Bolton and great for Liverpool but didn't fit with us. He was a player who could have thrived under this formation but his mentality was to become that one Drogba like player and be the main man which will not work with Chelsea. This is also the reason why if Lukaku isn't called back this season you shouldn't be surprised because the staff knows it all too well what is happening and how risky it is to put even a good striker at the end of our system.

Now to answer your question, no the strikers are not to blame but the team is also not to blame. We are playing football in a way which will make us one of the most exciting and successful teams in the league with the players and system we are developing. Even in the transition when this team clicked it could destroy any team it faced. A testament is that we have more points against the top 6 than any other teams in the league including the top 6. This team is designed to beat big teams and when we were not getting any luck and were knocked out our system was being implemented.

You are right that buying a striker isn't the answer. Our biggest strength currently is our system and not even a 40m pound big named striker which we might get. We need a striker which changes himself and fits himself into our system and even if that is Torres then its great. A traditional striker who just wants to be the main man will not work for this system and he will instead need the team to be redesigned again which will cause the rest of the midfield to contribute less and make the team more reliant on that one player. 

So just ignore the striker criticism because you should not currently treat our strikers like they need to score the majority of goals. Nor should you blame the midfield or the rest of the team because they are thriving under this new strategy because of which we just set a new goal scoring record. I just don't understand that the pundits and commentators who have a job to explain this don't even mention this.

Dangerously close to a Godwin.

&gt;we both know that court is a giant game and some people will do anything to win.

CJS professionals on all sides, as well as more experienced defendants, vary from naive young idealists, to cynical old lags and players in this regard (and it's not totally dictated by age/experience).  Legal, moral and professional ethics vary too, though they're generally different in terms of emphasis under an adversarial system.

&gt;What we need is a change of attitude and Id be happy to switch to an inquisitorial system to get it.

Well, we've been making that transition for a number of decades, and many of the protections which ought to be afforded the individual under an adversarial system have been lost, such that we've arguably reached a very uncomfortable, unbalanced and dysfunctional mixed system.  For example, the police still mostly view themselves as working under an adversarial system where their goal is the pursuit, capture and disposal of ""villains"" rather than as neutral and objective pursuers of truth, whatever that truth may be, but the right to silence has gone, double jeopardy protection is gone, there are efforts to force the disclosure of defences, access to legal representation and adequate resources for defence is being reduced, etc..  If we're going to remove the protections of the adversarial system, then we should move to the inquisitorial system wholesale as it only properly hangs together that way, but that means a very different role for the police, which they are currently unfit to provide, it also means different roles for other players in the criminal justice system, and relies on people having a great deal more faith in the State and its apparatus - especially judges - than I am currently able to muster in today's Britain.",0,1369037280,null,0,false,0,ca28v6l,t3_1emidg,t1_ca28v6l,t1_ca282s4,null,1431097975,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Oh no, it's completely different. See, if you're in the EU and you don't implement an EU harmonising directive, you get fined by the [Court of Justice of the European Union.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Justice_of_the_European_Union)

But if you're only in the EEA and you don't implement an EU harmonising directive, the CJEU can't fine you! Instead, you get fined by the [Court of Justice of the European *Free Trade Area*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFTA_Court). Which is completely different.

No, you may point out that the two courts have identical rules and jurisprudence, and coordinate with each other. But the second option is *clearly* much better for national sovereignty. I mean there's, like, two extra words in the court's name!

Ba and Torres aren't as good as him in either respect and that's why they get criticism. While it's not solely their fault, they must accept some of the blame. On the occasions they do get good service they both manage to fuck it up. Sometimes it seems Ba can only score half chances and Torres has been poor in the league save a few dynamic runs every so often that leave half the Chelsea fans totally forgetful of his previous performances.

* Look up and make eye contact - but don't stare. Looking at your feet is no good... staring at the ceiling is no good... be relaxed and personable, making easy eye contact with your audience members but without staring at any one person.

* You might even want to consider practicing these things in your bathroom mirror! It might feel silly - but by the time you get to doing it *live* you won't have to concern yourself with all the little details and it'll flow more naturally. 

* Practice the content of the presentation, learn it, learn it twice. Referring to notes is fine but if you're just reading out loud from a piece of paper it will *not* look good.

Both the ESCCE and the WTD have been long opposed by the Eurosceptic Tory right and others who believe that workers should not be entitled to paid leave at the cost of productivity and GDP.

When he fears the swedish authorities will give him to America he may have grounds for concern.

Julian Assange's case is currently at the stage of ""preliminary investigation"". It will only be concluded when Julian Assange is surrendered to Sweden and has been interrogated.


So from what I gather, there **is** a warrant for his arrest. But it is just for questioning as per 'preliminary investigation'. Prosecution of alleged accusations may not be formally taken up. 


This was a good read, thanks again.

I was talking with a friend about how annoyed I was with the whole ""hidden Doctor"" thing and he was trying to explain to me how, from a psychology standpoint, it makes sense. I see Hurt as less of a fully fledged regeneration, and more of a sort of compartmentalization of the Doctor that his mind created to cope with the atrocities he had to commit in the Time War. 

Although I am not terribly fond of that explanation, because it removes the Doctor's flaws. I liked how the fact that he's had to do terrible things in his life in the name of peace and greater good makes his character more whole-- this is something we see through regen after regen. Sometimes the Doctor has to let people die in the name of saving planets. Sometimes timelines are fixed and there's nothing he can do. Sometimes the right choice isn't the easy choice. Making an ""evil"" regeneration (or mental compartment) that the Doctor disowns due to these things just makes the character *too good*, and that's not good. The Doctor is a flawed hero, he always has been, and making up a new regeneration that was too flawed isn't interesting, imho.

EDIT: It does make a bit of sense though, the Doctor even disowned all the other Time Lords for the acts they committed in the final days of the Time War. Even though he's technically not the last live Time Lord as he often claims, in his mind, he is; because the others are not truly Time Lords anymore. Not the way the Doctor thinks they should be. So why shouldn't he disown his own self that took part in the same acts?

&gt;British dairy exports would incur an import tax of 55% to reach the EU market, with tariffs on some items of more than 200%. Cheddar cheese would face a tariff of €167 per 100kg; the mark-up on Stilton would be €141. Average tariffs on clothing would push up their price in European markets by 12%.

&gt;Parts of Britain’s car industry would move out. British-based producers would face a 4% tariff on car-equipment sales to the EU, and there would be pressure to impose tariffs on components imported from it. Factories owned by carmakers with plants and supply chains in other parts of the EU would be most at risk. Vital car components might be held up by customs as they leave the continent.

Some in Europe resent this: the governor of France’s central bank complained this week that euro deals should be done in euroland.

this year we just skipped our usual beat the big team, lose to the little team routine and instead just drew against everyone, sometimes they came back to snatch a draw, a lot more times we did....all entertaining but when I look at the table and then recall how many points we gave up it breaks me inside

the europa league exit was painful but man what an incredible game that was and im glad newer fans got a taste of what its like! the FA cup exit was a joke and brought us down to earth, we played incredibly shit...

Then the window came, after the earlier fiasco I know I was dreading it but first thing first we managed to ship out a lot of the unwanted 'mistakes' and brought in these two 'reject' kids for a cut price...

We never should have invested so heavily in the Europa League campaign. We blew at least one PL match due to fatigue caused by putting the 1st team in the Europa League. And we lost the 4th place spot by one match worth of points.

Even if we won the EL it would be a dot of compensation for not reaching the CL next year.

I think the manager now has a better handle on the quality and capability of his players and has showed the ability to make some good signings, though not all of them look great.

In the first half we showed a lot of promise but obviously didn't get great results. By the second half we were a legitimately good team playing attractive, effective football. If we're able to add a top class center half I think our starting eleven would immediately be good enough to compete for a top four spot next season, and maybe more than that. Below that starting squad we don't have as much depth as the teams who finished above us but we have a lot of very talented youth players who may solve that problem over the next 2-3 seasons. For the first time in a while, I think there is only one position that absolutely has to be addressed with a top quality player and no positions where we just have to clean house. Most of our moves beyond CB should be adding competition and depth, not trying to solve a black hole with a single signing. Our foundation is much better than it was a few years ago.

As I said, it was as advertised, which I think is important. The ownership built up credibility by setting realistic expectations and a budget and sticking to it. The manager made an honest assessment of the club and didn't try to convince everyone we were ahead of reality. They players were good professionals who didn't complain, showed dedication to learning a new system and were rewarded with improved results. All around it will go down as a forgettable system in club history but was an important one in the near term that gave us a chance to go onto much better things.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"**Open-Play Defending:** Worse than last season, because Rodgers is more biased towards attacking (the way some fans thought Benitez was biased towards defending; Benitez made his teams hard to beat first, Rodgers makes his teams hard to defend against first). Defenders have to cover more ground in this system, have less support, and also have to attack more. 

**Solution:** Either compromise the attacking a bit (or develop the street smarts to know when to keep attacking and when to hold possession or just defend, something that cost us in the Europa League on occasion), or get better defensive players in (especially a mountain to go alongside Agger), or hope the squad gets better with it with time, or all of the above. Basically, open-play defending isn't as much of a concern as...

**Set Piece Defending:** Probably at its worst in a while. Again, the right CB to partner Agger will help, but this is still an area where Rodgers needs to do a lot of work. Maybe it was *relatively* neglected compared to open-play tactics, given that it was Rodgers' first season and open-play stuff was obviously the most important thing to get right first?

Our ""Plan A"" for attacking is as good as it's been since 08-09; **""The Plan B"" of attack**, then: ***is not Andy Carroll***. When we're not breaking through teams, there's two reasons: firstly, we're taking too long to transition the ball from defence to attack; secondly, players are being impatient, and crossing the ball or shooting straight into opposing bodies, rather than moving the ball around until opportunities appear. The second one will fix with time. As for improving transition speeds? You can do that by being more direct, sure - and we've been more direct since Sturridge came in. 

That's why I don't think Carroll is the solution, because Sturridge is already getting us to play direct, and is quite good at holding the ball up (albeit in a different way to Carroll), and much more mobile, better with the ball at his feet, and much better suited to our supply line (Coutinho &amp; Suarez aren't going to create the sorts of chances Carroll needs, nor are inverted wingers; we're left with Enrique &amp; Johnson as the sole suppliers). The other way to move the ball faster between defence and attack is to just pass it around faster - so the real Plan B is to **be better at Plan A**, and to be patient. Patience is something Rodgers will have to work on - for me, Downing &amp; Johnson are the main culprits. Maybe it's an English thing?

**Character:** We need more calm heads on the field. Suarez is a hothead, and that's unchangeable, really. Gerrard, being a force-of-nature, isn't always the type to slow down a game and keep things calm. Lucas needs to assert himself more, and Allen can take on the 'calm head' role when he plays, hopefully. Whoever replaces Carragher has to be a fucking presence. Good luck with that.

**Transfers:** More windows like January please. We *definitely* need a man-mountain to partner Agger, another left-footed winger to compete with Downing, and a gamechanger from the bench, which we lack.

That's exactly my point. Some people object to the idea of marriage per se. It has certain connotations they object to. This is the point of extending civil partnership to everyone, so that it's not marriage-for-gays, but a means of providing the same legal protection to those who want to formalise their unions without marrying.

From wiki:

&gt;Time Lords receive their name for their non-linear perception of time, which allows them to see everything that was, is, or could be at the same time, as shown in the 1996 movie Doctor Who.

He also mentioned this in one of the 2005+ episodes.  I think it was Tennant who said it.  Time lords can see all the possible futures... which means if a companion dies... it's because it's the best possible outcome, and he had no other options.... and when no one dies, even if he puts them in danger, they were never really in danger, cause he can see the outcomes and what he has to do to make sure everything works out.

The one exception would be when he's going against another Time Lord, who also can see the possible futures based on their actions, meaning when the Doctor picks his action to create the better future, the other Time Lord will see the change in the time stream and be able to pick a new action to change the future the Doctor is creating.  Creating a mental chess game with their actions and the future.... the invention of Chess.


edit: 

&gt;In the 2005 series, the Ninth Doctor claims that he can sense the movement of the Earth through space[29] as well as being able to perceive the past and all possible futures.[30] He is also able to concentrate and time his motions well enough to step safely through the blades of a rapidly spinning fan and later claims that if any Time Lords still existed, he would be able to sense them.[31] As the Tenth Doctor he repeats this assertion, adding also that he is somehow innately able to sense which events in time are 'fixed' and which are in 'flux'.[32]

The Swiss actually did a study of the bilateral agreements versus EEA versus EU membership which I mentioned [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/150gv7/prime_minister_admits_for_the_first_time_that/c7igkft)

http://www.global-vision.net/files/downloads/download614.pdf

Annual Cost to Switzerland of alternative relationships with EU:2007-2013|Swiss francs millions|Index
:-|-:|-:
Continue Bilateral Agreements|557|100
Join EEA|737|132
Join EU (net contribution)|3400|610
Join EU (gross contribution)|4940|886

So they pay about 1/9th as much by bilateral agreements as they would joining the EU. This is comparable to the figure Farage mentions in the video below where Norway pays ""1/7th"" of what we pay per capita to be an EEA member instead of an EU one.

Interestingly bilateral agreements are slightly cheaper than EEA membership but not by much. And very interestingly EEA membership is much cheaper than EU membership despite all the FUD about ""government by fax"".

The UK is already a member of the EEA. Look at the cost index - it's almost as good as Swiss style bilateral agreements. Which could be negotiated in due course.

UKIP's policy is to leave the EU but stay in the EEA and then negotiate bilateral agreements. I.e. we'd go from EU member to EEA member like Norway and then leave the EEA to have a status like Switzerland. Importantly leaving the EU but staying in the EEA is not a bad outcome. Indeed EEA membership is almost as good as bilateral agreements according to the Swiss study.

If I understand correctly:

Gazz wants 'marriage' to be open to any couple. Given there are people who don't like this idea, he's suggested that the government should recognise it for everyone, but without the divisive name - so *everyone* is able to be in a civil partnership as far as the law is concerned. 

A marriage would therefore be just a religious/social term, one type of civil partnership, rather than civil partnership being a lesser form of marriage.

Ralph seems to be asking *why* the government should be forced to give up calling its arrangements marriages. I can understand that question - but the pragmatic answer is ""because there are a lot of people who want to limit how that word can be defined"". 

The theory behind Civil Partnerships was that (whether it's true or not) those against gay marriage argue that their concern is the dilution of the term 'marriage'. Of course, it still creates a 'separate but equal' situation, as straight people can't get partnered.

true,matcht,lfc12,,"Coutinho is obviously a huge talent, and is performing to a considerably higher level than Mata/Silva/Cazorla were at that age. But that doesn't mean he will be a better player than them, he will have to adapt as the opposition begins to realise he must not be allowed any space or time on the ball.

Sterling showed great promise in the first half of the season (I've seen us linked with Danny Rose today, Sterling beat him time and time again when they were up against each other this season), his performances later on may have given him a reality check though. He played too many games I think and you could see it in his dip in form and the injuries he picked up. He'll be a useful impact player next season. I think he'll be a first choice regular in another 2 seasons.

I've been disappointed not to have seen more of Suso because he is the most naturally talented player from our youth team, but I can understand the decision. He isn't suited to the wings since he isn't very pacey. He is knocked off the ball too easily to play as a no.10 at this stage of his career. Compare the first team experience of Coutinho and Suso, then you see why. He needs a loan, to a mid-table team in Spain (similar to what Coutinho did).

Ibe seems very promising, pace and strength. His build makes him very difficult to knock off the ball. I like that he is comfortable cutting in on his right and down the line on his left. Seems like a very honest and hard working player too. 17 is very young though, he could do with another year with the u-21s.

Wisdom looks a good prospect, he filled in at right back much better than Flanagan ever did and yet it isn't his favoured position. He was found out a little against United and Everton but at his age it isn't unusual. His future depends a lot on who we sign and who leaves. If Skrtel and Coates both leave, then I can see him and Kelly as our back up centre backs. I'm not convinced he will become a first choice player but he is useful enough to have around.

Shelvey has been disappointing. Not only in his performances but his attitude. He seems to make awfully bad decisions on a regular basis. His raw talent is definitely there but I'm not sure if he has a role to play at Liverpool at the moment. He has struggled playing off the striker, and can't play on the wings. He's behind Lucas, Gerrard, Allen and Henderson in the line for playing a deep midfielder. His confidence has clearly been knocked, remember he was tearing up the Championship over a year ago, a similar loan move will do him good. After that we'll need to see where he is at but I'm not sure he can fit in here, I hope I'm proven wrong.

OP didn't include Kelly because he was already in the first team before Rodgers came but I have high hopes for him. He can replace Carra, he is vocal, local born and as determined and committed as they come. We've seen him perform to a great standard at right back, he has the pace and comfort in possession to thrive as a centre back under Rodgers. Injuries have held him back but if the physio team can do with him what they did with Agger and Gerrard then we have a real talent on our hands (he's better than Phil Jones IMO, who every pundit seems to think is a guaranteed future England captain).",0,1369053358,null,0,false,0,ca2axu0,t3_1eosk0,t1_ca2axu0,t3_1eosk0,null,1431096997,21,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,21

There's an argument from John Stuart Mill which claims that the state should not persecute any one unless they infringe on the rights of others to be autonomous. His main reason for this, is that if the state does anything else it will be telling people how to live their lives and if it is telling people how to live their lives it is claiming that the state is infallible *which it quite clearly isn't*.

The point is, if we figure out some system of giving one person a vote (or multiple votes) and another person no votes (or fewer votes) then the person making the system is assuming that he knows better. How are we going to decide who knows better? Simple majority? 

furthermore, taking away people's right to vote is taking away their right to assemble and self govern. Those rights are central to being human and should not be taken away under any circumstance. It's immoral to take it away. Will better decisions be made if we let some benevolent dictator rule us? Possible. Is it immoral to let some benevolent dictator rule us? Yes. Furthermore, how do we know the dictator is benevolent? What's to stop this group of educated people who've passed the votership test forcing their will onto other people? What's to stop them forming a tyranny of the majority?

You know most of the least educated people in the USA are black, so if you introduced this votership test you would almost certainly strike a dispassionate amount of that ethnic group off of the voting register.

1. The ""Saved"" version of River in the library is the ""echo"", and she's fading, not at all living out her life in the computerverse.

It's never been mentioned that the saved versions could fade, the idea of putting them in the computer in the first place was so that they wouldn't fade. 

2. She's the echo of dying River, like the echoes of those people trapped in the suits, before their consciousness fade completely. But that means that the echo of River is independent, capable of thought and planning, not like the others that were trapped in their last moments. And that would also mean that the echo have been haunting 11 for decades, while the others lasted minutes.

That being said; we have civil unions now so we have to ""deal"" with them. The choices are:    

 - We convert everyone's civil union to a ""[gay] marriage."" Without their consent/approval (lawful?).     
 - We expand civil unions to straight people.    
 - We do nothing at all (and still have to do with the ""sex change"" problem).    

Personally my top choice would be to essentially wipe out the whole ""civil union"" thing and convert everyone to a marriage. But that has TONS of illegal and moral problems with it.    

My next best choice would be to expand civil unions to different-sex couples, but not right now (after the gay marriage bill has passed).

The problem with one cross, one vote is that it seems intuitive and ""fair"" on the face of it, but that only dresses up the remarkable inefficiencies. It is why it is so difficult to convince people to drop FPTP because it seems so ""fair"". Under FPTP you don't so much vote for who you want, you vote in the party that is most likely to prevent the party you *hate* from getting power.

I believe Labour and the Lib Dems have more in common with each other than with the Conservatives. You might be a Lib Dem supporter and agree with a vast majority of their policies but this is where the spoiler effect comes in.  You might really like the Lib Dems but the *last* party you want in is the Conservative Party. However, you don't think the Liberal Democrats have a good chance of winning but you know that Labour stands a chance, so you vote Labour because they have a better chance of keeping the Conservatives *out*. You vote for Labour despite the fact that you have more in common with the Lib Dems! It is called the *spoiler effect* and it reveals how *un*fair the traditional system is.

AV allows you to vote on preference. If you have 3 choices ranked from most preferred to least preferred you might put 1. Lib Dems, 2. Labour and if you *really* hate the Conservatives you could just leave 3. blank. 

You can see the inefficiencies of FPTP in the real world, like in the 2000 US Elections.

""The 2000 U.S. Presidential election is often cited as an example of the spoiler effect. In that election, Al Gore, the Democratic candidate, received more popular votes than George W. Bush, the Republican candidate, but lost in the electoral college. In the state of Florida, the final certified vote count showed Bush with just 537 more votes than Gore. Because Bush defeated Gore in Florida, he won the state, received more votes in the electoral college, and became president of the United States.

Gore supporters pointed out that, had candidate Ralph Nader, a liberal, not run in the election, the majority of the 97,421 votes he received in Florida would have been cast for Gore. Gore supporters contend that Nader's candidacy spoiled the election for Gore by taking away enough votes from Gore in Florida to swing the election to Bush. Their argument is bolstered by a poll of Nader voters, asking them for whom they would have voted had Nader not run, which said 45 percent of Nader voters would have voted for Gore, 27 percent would have voted for Bush, and the rest would not have voted""

We've abandoned the 16 point identification system as unscientific and we're relying on the expert to make a decent stab at matching up the minutiae with those of the suspect, and then certifying that there is individualisation.

We have huge issues with the validity and reliability of fingerprinting. There's no strong standard of admissibility (i.e. no equivalent of the Daubert test), and the whole thing can persuade juries far too quickly.

Secondly it is currently illegal for any church to marry a gay couple even if both the church and the gay couple wish to do so. This bill would change that so churches who do wish to marry gay couples can and those that do not wish to are legally protected from having to do so.

1. That fingerprints are accurate in individualisation.
2. That fingerprints are unique.
3. That fingerprint experts are totally accurate in their identification.

Firstly you need a good print, even if it's a perfect, whole print with a decent amount of minutiae present, it's not going to match the reference print due to elasticity changes. OK, the expert can correct for that, but it's still something that defence can argue.

Secondly, we don't know that fingerprints are unique. They probably are, but we don't know. We do know that DNA is unique. Fingerprint identification came about as a result of hobbyist research and was admitted to courts following Bertillonage being replaced. When courts asked for the credentials to be given, the experts at the time simply stated that prints are unique. The courts accepted this. Quite a clear jump in logic.

Furthermore, there are virtually no validity studies on fingerprinting. The specialists assert that prints are unique and that's that. I don't understand this. We don't hit Daubert thresholds for admissibility, and it's been argued that other sciences don't need to bother (i.e. physics). The difference is that many areas of physics can't be subjected to a validity study whereas fingerprinting can. Why do we focus on uniqueness over validity? I suspect that it would tarnish the reputation of the science somewhat as the error rate would be fairly high. 

Furthermore, you've got issues of bottom-up processing and top-down analysis. Bottom-up is good in that it's objective, but when the print is ambiguous (and it often is), then top-down can influence the result. This is particularly a problem with emotive and important cases. Top-down ""mindset"" led to the FBI's misattribution of the Madrid bomber due to print evidence.

Sure, prints are good evidence on a superficial level, and they're good as a broader array of evidence, but in terms of proving that a suspect was there, they're pretty useless and definitely challengeable. 

I seriously disagree with them being better than DNA on the grounds of contamination. Prints are often highly contaminated. DNA is subject to much stricter requirements because it actually was properly explained to the court and it meets Daubert criteria. As I'm sure you already know, stuff like Polymerase Chain Reaction to increase the sample size is subjected to tests for possible contamination. If you don't have sufficient loci then you don't have a complete cell and it's not admissible.

WALL OF TEXT ALERT. And English is not my native language and im to lazy to spell check etc so bair with me.


First: I hope more then anything that AVB stays at Spurs to become a Tottenham legend. I hope this is the beginning of an era. We have got our hands on a manager with so much ambition, drive and passion. We got a manager that has proven that he has one of the sharpest managar minds in the game, a beautiful connection with the players, the fans and the whole club. He has made amazing signings in the likes of Dembele, Hugo, Siggy, Jan and Holtby. Three of them probably our best players after Bale this season. He is humble and easy to love, respected, passionate about the club and has stated that he is staying in Spurs as long as we want him to. What more can we ask? I wouldnt want any other manager in the world right now to manage Spurs. He is our man, he WILL bring us great succes, i know it.


Second: We are getting Champions League next year and probably finishing 2-3. With the likes of Sandro and Younes returning our defence is gonna more solid then ever. We already have great rotation in the squad, next year we will have Townsend back probably. We are surely gonna buy somone for the midfield if Dempsey leaves. Our star, Gareth, looks to be staying at the club. We have two magnificent developing players in Siggy and Holtby. One a true warrior, he will give his best and fight until the whistle blows every single game. The other one spent the first half of the season mostly on the bench. But has came in to the squad so smoothly and scored some vital goals for us this second half of the season. Again a sign of how magnificent AVB is, he is not stuborn and naive like other managers tend to be. I've got 3 examples, Hugo and Brad, Huddlestone, and Siggy. At the start we of the season everyone had their thought on our goalies. One of them a extremly experienced, very solid and loyal man. The other one, a quite young, but sooo talanted man. AVB sorted it out so perfectly. Letting Brad start in the start of the season and letting Hugo get more and more games, and when the power switch came it felt like brad was totally fine with it, he knew he is old (sound bad saying old haha) and having such a talanted man sitting on the bench is a waste. But the way AVB handled it, wow, just wow. It feels like Brad has so much respect for him for the way he did it, and at the same time it felt like Hugo got in to the team in the best possible way. And AVB being loyal as he is let Brad play all the EL matches. Then we got Huddlestone, AVB told hud he can leave if he wants he did not see a place for him in the team. But hud worked hard and surely AVB said that he was wrong and fair enough hud has played and has been really good in some of our second half season games. 
Same thing with Siggy, he got some minutes in the end of the games but nothing more. Then just like that we see him starting and being fantastic in some appearances. Now ofc we have to sign one if not two strikers. I would really like a young striker, and seing AVB has been to Barcelona etc scouting, it may aswell happend. BUT we need a top class striker and that should be prio number one. Benteke, Villa, Damiao. I dont see us getting anyone like Dzeko, Hernandez from the bigger english teams, but who knows. And atleast we have so muc youngsters that are looking promising i can only see a bright future for THFC.

Well firstly gay couples can't get married, it simply can't be done. Churches have been able to 'bless' civil partnerships. I don't know if churches can ""marry"" gay couples if they choose but it would be purely ceremonial. Under the law it would will be illegal for Church of England to do marry couples... for some stupid reason.

In short churches have to ""opt in"" to being allowed to marry gay couples or it will be illegal for them to have done so. At the same time gay couples can simply marry in civil ceremony.

&gt;I know, I'm basically saying if the church is discriminating against me, then why the hell would I want to be a part of that bigotry and hate? It's a different issue, but it baffles me.

There isn't just one church and as shitty as they have been historically and as shitty as a lot of them are now there are lots of different churches and religions that have no problems with gay people. Most people won't want to get married in somewhere that hates them but not every church hates gay people and there are good number who have been campaign for this change on behalf of their gay members. 

This is simply about giving people choice, church's to marry gays if they want and gays being able to be married in those churches if they so choose. I can understand totally why you wouldn't want to but I don't see what that has to do with anything we are talking about here. You should be free to a make your choice and at the moment you are not, that what you would choose to do happens to be the only option at the moment doesn't really have anything to do with that.

true,[deleted],null,null,"This is a bit of an abuse of the term ""false 9,"" but I know what you are getting at. I think your analysis of our system and the role of strikers is exactly on point.

Where I disagree with you is the narrative. I think that the system we play, which limits the necessity for a monolithic striker, was not created in a vacuum, but rather as a reaction to a lack of quality striking. I'd point to the second half of the 2010-11 season as the beginning of this. Abramovic buys Torres in January, and despite managing only 1 goal, he makes 18 appearances. In my mind, there is no way that this was Carlo's idea. It was almost certainly a Shevchenko situation, where Abramovic was mandating that Torres play.

So how does Carlo cope with this? He adjusts the way the team plays. As a result, goals start flowing freely from the midfield, notably Malouda, and defense.

When AVB inherits the team, he is given a team with an aging star who seems, by all accounts, to have lost his knack for rampant goal scoring, and a misfiring Spaniard. How does he react to this? Well mostly he continues to develop a system under which the strikers aren't expected to score the goals. Sturridge in particular benefited from this. He was allowed to play a goal scoring role from the right flank (on a side note I think this earned him a lot of undue criticism).

RDM, in my mind, did very little tactically in his tenure as manager. I think he basically reinstated the senior players and said do what you do. Not trying to pick a fight about RDM, he did a lot of other stuff, just that tactically I'm not sure he contributed very much.

So now Benitez takes over, and all he has is Torres, who is still struggling, and Ba, who has just arrived, so he keeps doing more of the same.

---

Okay what is my tl;dr? **We do have a system designed to take goal scoring pressure of the strikers, but it was implemented because of the struggles our strikers were having. A decent manager can remedy it very quickly if he has a top notch 9.**",0,1369063519,null,0,false,0,ca2dgai,t3_1eof5e,t1_ca2dgai,t1_ca28ilg,null,1431095813,12,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,12

* Andros Townsend - We desperately need him for cover on the wings. If Lennon wasn't fit, we generally lost a lot of width in attack.
* Danny Rose - Should give us a legitimate back up to BAE instead of playing Vertoghen (albeit effectively) or Naugton out of position.
* Tom Carroll - He's amazingly competent on the ball for a player of his age, and should really start to get more minutes playing the holding role.

**Out**

* William Gallas - Sell him far, far, far away. Like China... or Australia.
* Tom Huddlestone - While I'd hate to see him go, he's made it clear that he doesn't want a reserve role in the past. His stock won't ever be higher, and now's the time to cash in if we can.
* Jake Livermore - He's seems to have stagnated under AVB, and at bare minimum go out on loan. 
* One of Defoe or Adebayor - But ONLY if *at least one* striker is brought in to replace them; preferably two though.
* David Bentley, Heurelho Gomes, and Bongani Khumalo - Just to get them off our freaking books already.

* STRIKERS - We need multiple, regardless of departures. At bare minimum, we need three first team strikers. In order, I'd prefer: Gonzalo Higuaín, Robert Lewandowski (dreaming), Jackson Martínez, Loïc Rémy, Christian Benteke.
* OFFENSIVE MIDFIELD - A central creator to unlock stuck in defenses is a necessity. Obviously, long-term target Moutinho would be ideal. But I also love Ajax's Christian Eriksen.
* DEFENSIVE MIDFIELD - Another winger would be nice, but cover at holding/defensive midfield should be a higher priority so long as Townsend returns from his loan spell.

Moffat is all about redirection and misinterpretation. Even within the episode, Vastra thought that it was the doctor's secret that had been discovered, but it was his grave.

true,shakawhenthewallsfel,lfc12,,"I'm no expert, but my $0.02:

Sterling-18- I think he's been quite impressive for his age. I don't think he's got much of a first-team role next season, especially depending on who gets added to the squad in the summer (and assuming there are no surprise departures), so he'd probably benefit from a loan somewhere where he could get more playing time, but I think he's someone we definitely want to hold on to.

Coutinho-20- Obviously he has already proved he's a huge impact player and he deserves to be starting every game. I do think next season he'll be challenged a bit more as teams begin to adjust to him, but even so, I expect him to be a force and I hope we can hang onto him for a long time.

Suso-19- I think he has a lot of potential, but he's going to be second-fiddle to Coutinho for the foreseeable future so a loan would probably make sense for him. 

Ibe-17- Granted, we didn't see much of him but I was pretty impressed. Obviously he's still very young, but I'd say maybe a loan for him too if we could place him somewhere he's going to get first-team time. Definitely someone we want to keep long-term, I'd say.

Wisdom-20- I think he's definitely shown promise, and we'll probably see a good bit of him in the first team next season depending on who gets picked up this summer. My biggest worry about him now is that with Carra gone, the back line lacks an elder statesman who can guide and coach guys like him as he develops. But hopefully the coaching staff can pick up that slack.

Shelvey-21- I'm not convinced by what he's done this season, especially given that he's the oldest of the players listed here. I'm not sure I'd toss him just yet; maybe try to place him on loan at a mid or lower-tier club in the premier league next season where he's gonna be starting (if that's possible; not sure it is) and see what he can do over a season with more playing time.

It's like a black guy wanting to be a part of the KKK. Yeah, I know, equality is important, but since the church has shown it is unwilling to adapt, let the bigots and hate die off while the rest of society progresses without it.

Remember not every religion feels the same way. This isn't just Anglicanism, or even Christianity. There may be plenty of religions out there which would treat a gay couple the same as a straight one. But the law as it stands doesn't allow them to. I'm all for a solution which would separate the state legal marriage (and allow it for straight and gay couples) then let religion do what it likes afterwards, with whatever criteria they choose to who's allowed and who isn't. But if we are going to respect these religious celebrations as legally valid for straight couples the same should be available for gay couples too if their administrating religion chooses so.

**OUT**

Thudd: He doesn't want to be a bench player, and there's literally no way he starts next season (assuming health).

Parker: This is the last year we're going to be able to get anything for him and we just have too many midfielders.

BAE: Love the guy, but he doesn't seem to fit in AVB's system (as seen by AVB picking Naughton over him multiple times while healthy).

Defoe: Same as Parker. We'll still be able to get a decent chunk of cash for him, and he's stated he doesn't like coming off the bench. Hopefully we'll sign a striker (Villa?), and that would make him the 3rd choice, which he won't like.

Rose: He's stated that he doesn't want to be a bench player, and while he's been tremendous for Sunderland, I just don't really see him as a top 4 player. I'd absolutely love to have him as cover and a cup/Europa starter, but I don't think he'd like that.

Carrol (loan): I don't see him getting much starting time with us next season, outside of cup matches or Europa, which I don't think is enough for his development. I think he needs to be sent to a mid-table type team and see what he can really do at this level.

**In**

Townsend: I'm not sure how many you guys watched, but I'd say I watched about half of the QPR matches after Townsend joined and it was ridiculous how much better he was than everyone else on the pitch (for QPR). I think he outclassed their entire team by himself. I could genuinely see us playing Bale through the middle next year with Townsend on the left.

Villa: It just makes perfect sense. The rumor is 10 million, and the guy would fit our system perfectly. Levy needs to jump on this, quickly.

LB: Not sure who, specifically, just a left back.

CM(?): Not really sure if we need a CM, to be honest. If we could actually still get Moutinho, that sounds like something you'd have to pull the trigger on, but then the question is: who loses their starting spot? Sandro and Dembele were fucking immense together in the double pivit, neither of them are going anywhere. Bale is obviously not going anywhere. I genuinely think Townsend should start. That really leaves Lennon as the odd man out. I love little azza, but I think Moutinho would do more for the team than Lennon, and he would still be great to have off the bench. If we got Moutinho, I would see us switching to AVB's 4-3-3, with a Sandro-Dembele-Mouthinho midfield (just wet myself a little) and Townsend-Villa-Bale across the top.

I got into Villa around 1995/1996. I'd like to point out that first and foremost, I'm an Aberdeen fan through and through. They are my main team.

Anyway, back to my story. Back in '95 my siblings and friends were getting into English football. With the majority supporting Manchester United, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur. 

I felt a bit left out and wanted to get in on the action but didn't really want to support a ""big"" club like Man Utd where I'd just be seen as glory hunting so I watched a lot of football to see what clubs I like. At the time there were sweets for sale, chocolate egg things with footballers in them. No matter where I went I always seemed to get Gareth Southgate when he played for Villa so I kind of took that as a sign and followed the claret and blue ever since!

It doesn't bother me that West Ham's kit is similar.

**Players On Loan Who Will Make It** - Courtois, De Bruyne, Lukaku, Kalas, Chalobah

**Players On Loan Who Are Unlikely To Make It** - Delac, Kane, Davila, Osmanovic, Pirez, Clifford, Saville, Walker, Bamford

*Essien* - I think if anyone can get the best out of Essien, it is Mou. He could become a decent squad player, perhaps not the dynamic engine he once was, but I think pair him with Ramires and we will have a solid midfield with bite and energy. Will offer a different option to Mikel, and a bite of steel where we need it. 

*Courtois, De Bruyne, Lukaku* - Pretty much goes without saying these guys are as talented as we have. All could do with loans, either to teams in European competitions, or in England (unlikely to be both, thanks Swansea and Wigan!) I think Lukaku would do well under Laudrup, would learn a lot tactically, and would fit into the Swans team very well. They play a similar formation to us, are in need of a striker, and will play in the Europa next season. De Bruyne has a bright future, could see him replacing de Guzman at Swansea should they not sign him. Hope he doesn't go to Leverkusen. Courtois is a gem, lets just hope he is patient!

*Chalobah and Kalas* - Don't watch much Eredivise, but the stuff I hear about Kalas is brilliant. Versatille, which always helps, and provides a decent attacking threat. Would be nice to see him on loan in England next year, as long as he is going to get first team football. Was concerned when I saw Chalobah playing as a DM for Watford, thought he would take over from JT in the heart of the defence, but seems to have grown into the position well. Doesn't mean he couldn't play both, but seems to really be handy in midfield. A loan at Watford again (should they get promoted), or a decent Premier League team that can promise first team football.

*Piazon, Bruma, Hazard and van Aanholt* - Lots of promise, but not sure how well they developing. By all accounts Piazon has done well at Malaga, a season long loan for him is a must I think, help him develop further. Hazard needs a loan at a more reputable league, or the Championship perhaps? Get used to a more physical game. Bruma seems to have stagnated, and van Aanholt has apparently been good for Vitesse, but not sure whether he will make the step up.

*McEachran and Kakuta* - All that fuss for Gael, and what? Not sure if it was too much hype, or an attitude issue, but I fear he will never be the player he was touted as being. McEachran has done well at Boro, but I still question whether he will ever cut it at Chelsea. Both are great natural talents, but are perhaps a little physically underdeveloped. 

*Delac, Omeruo, Wallace* - Omeruo and Wallace are completely unknown qualities to me. I have heard reasonable, if not spectacular things about them. Delac can't seem to buy minutes anywhere. 

*The Others On Loan* - All seem to be youth team players who have found their level I think. ",0,1369065235,null,0,false,0,ca2dzrm,t3_1ep40b,t1_ca2dzrm,t3_1ep40b,null,1431095546,18,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,18

-We're also going to have to make sure Caulker is OK being 4th CB (behind Dawson, Vertonghen, and Kaboul). 

-I think there is a future for Townsend and Falque at the club (both had solid loan spells), particularly with Bale playing in the hole.

-I want to see Coulibaly and Ceballos bled into the first team as well. Our youth team is now one of the best in Europe. And at 18 &amp; 20 they are the age players like Bale and Walker were when they came into the side and started contributing.

That campaigns as much for heterosexuals to enter into Civil Partnerships as it does for gay people to marry, and there have been straight couples who want to enter into CPs since at least that time (see the linked newspaper articles).

ETA: This is what Tatchell had to say about this today:

&gt;""Both the Tory government and the Tory rebels reject full equality. They have double standards on civil partnerships and civil marriages.
&gt;
&gt;David Cameron supports equal marriage for gay couples but opposes equal civil partnerships for heterosexual couples. In contrast, the Tory rebels reject same-sex marriage but are demanding opposite-sex civil partnerships. Both sides are inconsistent, hypocritical and wrong.
&gt;

true,Stormwatch36,cyberman,Cyberperson,"We've got all the way until November to think about it. The biggest problem I'm seeing with almost *every* Hurt theory at the moment is that people are forgetting he's a secret. Nobody knows about the John Hurt incarnation *except* the Doctor, and the Doctor is ashamed of whatever Hurt did. This tells us that he is not:

1. The Valeyard. The Valeyard is not a secret. The Great Intelligence was fully aware of the Valeyard, and he was in the middle of trying to track down the Doctor's biggest secret. I doubt that the GI is dumb enough to accidentally put the thing he's looking for in the discard pile, so to speak.

2. Between Eight and Nine. The Doctor fully embraces what he had to do during the Time War as his own actions. He has never once implied that he is *ashamed* of anything he did during the Time War, he painfully accepts it as what had to be done for the sake of the universe. Yet, he is so ashamed of whatever Hurt did that he refuses to accept him as a valid incarnation of himself. Not only that, but the Time War is also not a secret. Finding the book in the TARDIS would be as valuable as finding John Hurt if it was. Plus, Ten's long sit down with Martha at the end of Gridlock shows that the Doctor is perfectly willing to talk about the Time War. This is the theory that rustles my jimmies the most, because there's a giant pile of shit that goes against it. Everyone's ignoring all of that though and formulating this solely based on a single piece of Hurt's wardrobe.

3. A repressed/forgotten regeneration. Eleven knows about him, therefore we can assume that any other incarnation after Hurt's creation also knows about him.

John Hurt is something new. Believing that he's the result of an event that has already occurred is to completely ignore the fact that he is the Doctor's biggest secret. **Only** the Doctor knows about him.",0,1369066350,null,0,1369066642,0,ca2ecnr,t3_1eo1um,t1_ca2ecnr,t1_ca2e55g,null,1431095378,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

When we beat you 5-2 we didn't vote any thread high at all, because we knew there was a long way until the season was over. You decided to upvote a thread about being 7 points ahead of us as your 2nd top highest of all time.

That was your clubs greatest accomplishment since this subreddit got big so you upvoted it as much as you could.

We want to make Arsenal seem much bigger than Spurs, so when ever someone goes onto this subreddit now, when they search the top post of all time they will see a moment when Spurs beat Arsenal, and were 7 points clear, but still finished below us.

That post will always be your top voted of all time, we wanted to cement it their so you remember that being 7 points ahead or beating Arsenal isn't a great achievement, the achievement of finishing above us at the end of the season is far greater. 

You should remember to not celebrate beating us so much in the future. And you may think us having the ""HAPPY ST TOTTERINGHAMS DAY 2013!"" thread as the highest rated of all time is pathetic.

Well in truth it's the biggest accomplishment we've had since the subreddit was born. Finishing above you this season is the greatest accomplishment in the last two years. What else should we have? I'd much rather that post was top than a meme.

They will use this term and not ""Jose will stay for next season"" because if they want him to leave they want him to quit.

Then again it might just be the news we've been waiting to hear but just posting this in case it is that panic situation so /r/chelseafc  doesn't commit a mass suicide.

Either way if this press conference is about Mourinho it is the starting step to him leaving. Whatever happens, if his future is questioned we will be on the fast track to getting him if we are in contention.

&gt;Florentino Perez will announce that Mourinho will leave Madrid after the last game of the season

Guillem Balague is a very good source. He has now said that Jose will leave on 02 June and has met with the chief and they have reached an agreement (An agreement could mean a dissolution of the contract with both parties splitting damages). He has also said that Falcao will leave at the end of the season.

An unpaid debt would usually be a civil matter as I understand it - your credit card company can't send police round because you haven't paid your bill.  Nor could I do anything more than threaten debt collectors on a wonderful company who decided they could interpret ""Strictly 30 days"" on an invoice to mean 60.

true,hotcod,null,null,"&gt;The European Court of Human Rights ruling a church HAS TO WED GAYS, against the churches wishes, in effect dictating to people what their religion should be.

What ruling is that? Dubois v France? The one in which the [the daily mail made shit up?](http://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2012/03/29/can-a-homosexual-person-adopt-his-or-her-partners-child-the-case-of-gas-and-dubois-v-france/) Or are you talking about the issues raised in  [Schalk and Kopf v. Austria?](http://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2010/11/30/european-states-will-not-be-forced-to-allow-gay-marriage/) Which far from being undebated make up the main thrust of the Church of Englands arguments. There is a  some ways of reading these ruling that could be seen as leading to Churches being forced to marry which is why the bill provides for legal locks that head of the way they would have to be challenged. On top of that the EU courts are incredibly sensitive to being seen as dictating how states define marriage and again, and again, have ruled that what the state decided tends to go on this topic.

So in short you are spouting hyperbole about points that have been a huge part of the debate as issues not being talked about in it. Highly convincing that isn't. 

&gt;Also, gay people being able to adopt. The last time this was discussed here people did link to studies that showed kids raised in gay households are more likely to be gay.
Which, if you think about it makes sense. Some gays are gayer than others, for example. Or 'camper' or 'more feminin'. There must be a line of how gay a man is before he becomes bisexual, then another line before becoming fully straight.

Even if this was true what's the problem exactly? This can only be an issue is being gay is somehow seen as detrimental. The fact you think this is a talking point speaks volumes about your feelings.

One just one frame I have to use many points on just one face, and there are 30 frames in one second of video. That's just the face. Then on to the other people, or the arm, or the monster. Etc.

Another example. There is a circle on the wall from the Tardis. I color it and feather it. But, the doctor walks in front of it. For every frame he walks in front of that one circle, I have to adjust it to ""move"" or ""hide"" as he walks past it and adjust the shape of the color.

true,free2bejc,1986,Gianfranco Zola,"Whilst I acknowledge that I don't know that Emenalo is directly responsible for our problems. I can't help thinking that our club is probably the poorest run of the top 4. Easily the poorest. We regularly fail to actually get home/club grown players into the team. Given that there are 4 places in the squad for this under Champions league rules (Currently, Terry, Betrand, and Aké and presumably someone else) there really is no excuse, we actually have to have 4 club grown players in our 25 man squad.
If we have such great youth why the hell isn't it being used to add depth to the first team. It would infact be great to have u21's as they don't even have to be declared in the squad to play in the Prem! Wouldn't that be bloody useful for rotation.
This squad managing has to be done by the Director because we don't have a manager long enough to get to know the youth team.
Equally it is possible to have a youth player such as Aké playing and training with the first team and if he's not in your game plans at the weekend, to keep match fitness and game time you can ask him to play in the reserves. There's no registration clashes or anything. I'm fairly sure he could still have played in the next gen too.

Overall our young players tend to be under-experienced. If we actually had a proper Director of Football he should have the connections necessary. I mean we loan Courtois out quite fruitfully gaining important European experience. The best for his development would be Tottenham but it would be worse for us aha. I'm fairly sure the Courtois deal was probably more brokered by his agents than us. And equally the depth of our contacts extends to WBA, with a man who used to be our Assistant Manager. Hardly establishing long lasting youth connections that we need. On the other hand, I believe the next gen helps with playing other youth systems with the calibre of PSV. Although it was noticeably missing Manchester United. And you can easily see why. If they have the potential. They are a squad player for the first team. Who the hell chooses to keep Benayoun instead of McEachran. Frankly he should have been playing in the championship for somebody at 16 and his development appears to have stalled. How he was touted as being equal with Wilshere now appears to be naïve.
These are actually things that ought to be adressed by our Director of Football. Nobody else. He should be doing that job. Even if we do have Piet de Visser as Abramovic's best friend, he hasn't exactly created PSV in England. We don't pick them up at 12, more like 16 and they don't actually enter an adult league until 18. We have been pathetic and I don't see that changing.

I really don't want to be consistently so negative about the club but I honestly can't believe how rubbishly run we are. I mean come on, we could have employed anyone decent. Heck why didn't we steal Southampton's old Director of Youth when we needed a new Director. Sadly I know the answer, and it's because Roman doesn't know much about football. Although then again, if he did, he might not have bought us ahahah

EDIT: changed possibly to probably. Oh and also, I think there's a difference between building and buying. We have to make the transition to a building club.

And yes our depth for goals is a very, very good thing. If you look at teams that set up around a single goalscorer - Real Madrid, Barcelona, Spurs, Dortmund - they're all one injury or loss of form away from a disaster (e.g. Barcelona's CL semi final tie against Bayern). It's good for the team as well as taking the burden off individual players.

However it becomes much more difficult to pinpoint why exactly we play like this. I don't think you can talk of a tactical ""system"" at Chelsea. If you show me a team coached by Klopp, Pep, Wenger, Martinez, Fergie, AVB or Mourinho I can probably tell you how that team sets up and plays on the pitch. With all our managerial changes I cannot do the same for Chelsea. And this lack of year to year tactical continuity worries me, I think it's the difference between the top clubs and ourselves. We were getting there with Carlo, but you know...

I guess what I'm saying is who is making this happen if we have a new manager every six months? Personally I think it has to do mostly with our players' individual skill. Ivanovic, Terry, Cahill, Mata, Hazard, Oscar, and especially Lampard are proficient scorers for their positions.

Anyways, I would hope that our new manager has an idea about how to play and can get the best out of our players.

I think the implications are absolutely massive. Imagine not having to own a car, just having a subscription to a driverless fleet. Thousands of these things roaming the streets, you order one from your smartphone, 2 mins later it's outside your house. No more congestion. FAR few cars on the road. Parking problems eliminated. Car parks turned into homes, shops or green spaces. Residential areas reclaimed for people and leisure, rather than cars. Improved battery tech should come along at the same time, so they'll absolutely be electric. Cleaner city air. Potential for batteries to charge at night and/or balance the grid at times of excess renewables production. Reduced foreign oil dependance.
Massively improved transport options for people not old enough/not able enough/not sober enough to drive.
Improved productivity, instead of a stressful commute every morning you can use the time to catch up on some e-mails, or finish that book.


Improved road safety, these systems will be far better at spotting pedestrians and cyclists. In one of google's tests the car randomly slowed as the came to the top of the hill, they thought it had malfunctioned, but it actually spotted someone walking out between two parked cars before anyone in the car did. Some pretty big health savings go along with this reduction in accidents.


Logistics. No reason why this can't be included in lorries and delivery vehicles. No more working time directive limitations on deliveries. These things will drive 24 hours a day.
Make no mistake, there will be huge opposition from vested interests. Car companies who sell vehicles for 'lifestyle reasons', taxi cab firms, truck driver unions, people who just plain like to drive. It will put millions out of work, but I think the work will still be there, it will just change.

&gt;That's fucking ridiculous. For one, why should you not be allowed to defend yourself? 

I don't believe in carrying anything for self defence. If you are carrying you are more likely to kill, regardless. If you have a knife on you and don't know how to use it then you're just as likely to be harmed than if you're not.

&gt; It's legal for him to carry knives where he lives, so he has it for a tool and self defence.

Doesn't matter whether or not it's legal in the US, he was asking about *opinions* from the UK. That is my opinion.

If you need it for work then it shouldn't be in your pocket. It should be in a toolbox or bag. 

&gt;Says who? I bet if you have a car, it goes more than 70 miles an hour, what's the point, the speed limit is 70.

Says OP. He says he uses it mostly for opening boxes. That's a Stanley knives intended purpose, therefore a 4"" blade is over the top. I'm also guessing he's not going camping everyday, if he was then it's fine for those circumstances but it still should not be in your pocket if you're walking around in a city.

I doubt Thorgan will go to the Championship, it would just be a step down from the Belgian league and he's good enough to play in a better league. I have a lot of faith in Piazon, he's started a few times for Malaga and on the occasions I've actually seen him he's looked very good. From what I've seem of him Van Aanholt is probably better than Bertrand and will probably be playing in a better league next year. I don't know much about Bruma. 

Regarding McEachran and Kakuta, we should remember how much we've stunted their development. Kakuta was loaned to premiership sides where he couldn't make the first team and McEachran wasn't loaned at all for half the season then loaned to a club whose best players all played in his position. I don't think Kakuta will be good enough for us, but I think McEachran will be; he's got great technique for a 20 year old, but does need to improve his overall intelligence, which is best improved by playing games. Unfortunately, technical, scrawny midfielders tend to develop slower than other players so I don't expect to see McEachran playing regularly for us soon and I fear he won't make it here due to the impatience shown by the club.

I think Omeuro can make it with us, I've only seen him in the ACON, but he was excellent.

true,indyK1ng,smith,Smith,"Right, so that was a problem that needed immediate solving.  So he did, because that's what he does.  But what says he immediately turned around and went to the situation that we saw him in in Smith and Jones.

I would also like to point out two other things, one in universe one out of universe.  Out of universe, Davies' and Moffat's storytelling are very different.  Davies is very much the ""Now that's over, let's move on"" type storyteller whereas Moffat tends to deal with the consequences for a longer period of time and show the effects events have on their characters.

In universe, it's easy to say that the Doctor had a thick skin to death from the Time War and when he lost Rose, he still had this semi-functional sanity defense mechanism in place.  By the time he adventured with Amy and Rory, he'd learned to move on and be vulnerable again.  He let himself grow close to them.  Think about this, he could barely admit his love for Rose, yet when travelling with Amy and Rory he's willing to go to much greater lengths for them and openly expresses affection for River.  Then he lost them suddenly (let's just accept his explanation for the time being).  If I were him, the defense mechanisms that kept me from having to live with all the horrible things I'd done and all the people I'd lost would just be exploded by this loss.  He'd finally let himself get that close to people again and he'd lost them.  Trust me, when you're keeping bad feelings locked away and let yourself enjoy things again, losing that can be just as devastating, if not worse, than the initial traumas or the triggering trauma.",0,1369071592,null,0,false,0,ca2g5pr,t3_1emzge,t1_ca2g5pr,t1_ca29qkt,null,1431094526,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Luke is the chosen one, what does that mean? It means dying near him will allow you to reincarnate via the force, but not if you commit suicide.

In the first movie, Obi Wan ventures with Luke knowing full well that he's the chosen one. That's why they find the most 'wretched hive of scum and villainy'. Obi Wan keeps the plot going into more and more dangerous territory, until he is dueling with Darth Vader. He appears to be doing so with ease, after all, Obi taught him everything he knows. He can't even be bothered to use the force to aid him. Everything is going fine until Obi sees Luke. They make eye contact while Vader's back is turned and Obi just *stops*. He makes no move to defend himself and dies at Vader's hand.

Then, Luke ventures to Dagobah to study under Yoda. He feels he is ready to be a Jedi, but Yoda insists that he isn't. Yoda demands that training continues *until he dies*.

Vader tries to get Luke to kill him in Empire Strikes Back, revealing that he is Luke's Father and forcing him to the edge of this bottomless shaft. It doesn't work, though, much to Vader's chagrin.

Later, the Emperor will try to get Luke to kill him, but Vader will interfere, not wanting immortality for this evil man. He promptly throws the Emperor down another bottomless shaft.

At the conclusion, Vader is being carried away by his son. He stops him and asks for the one thing he really wants, to 'look at his son with his own eyes', which he knows will kill him and thereby give him immortality. He can't do it himself, that'd be cheating. That's why Luke takes off Vader's helmet.

I would go back to the letting agency, explain you are not happy with the landlords antics and ask them to find you an alternative accommodation.

However if the agreement with your letting agents was as you say above then there is no need to change.

The people on the other side of the argument are worried about how, maybe, just maybe if all the legal protections don't work out that the state may be dictating to religions who they should marry seem to have lost sight of the fact the state is already doing it. One morality and religious idea of marriage is being forced on all people and all religions and that is simply *not right*. 

The Church of England issue will resolve one way or another in time. We've already seen the start of fundamental issues with the whole womens Bishops things. The simple fact is that is the church is going to remain the state church and hold any form of power (such as their lords seats) in that state then they *must* abide by the states rules. They've been given a lot of leeway with that over the years but public opinion will shift. The CoE is part of the state not above it and it will have to decide what role it wants to play.

There is also more to christianity than simply CoE or catholicism are not the be all and end all and there is more to our religious life than the sects of one faith.

First:[Spoiler point one](#s ""their graves. This tells us about when they died and possibly where they died. From the way the Doctor has described things like that, it could create a fixed point for their deaths. The situation loops. If they hadn't been zapped back in time, they wouldn't have had the grave to look and go 'ooh' over. Then they wouldn't have been zapped back. Adventuring with the Doctor appears to be pretty iffy for the health, so going to pick them back up could easily mean that they die elsewhere, preventing their grave from being in the graveyard. This could create a paradox. Then again, the Doctor could easily arrange to have the graves made without corresponding bodies."")

Second: [Spoiler bad habits](#s ""the Doctor has a bad habit of not looking back. How many companions has he left twisting in the wind, in one fashion or another? How many companions does he go back for when they've essentially chosen someone else over him? 'Goodbye, Raggedy Man,' Amy said, weeping. She didn't call him Doctor. She used the name of her 'imaginary friend' from so long ago. The choices we see in the Dream Lord episode are reflected here again. It's not the Doctor she can't live without; it's her husband. Couple that with Amy and Rory's decision to travel less and less with the Doctor, you have an opportunity where he can leave them and claim he can't see them again. He hates goodbyes."")

true,CrispierDuck,eng-GreaterLondon,Central London,"&gt;The thing with raising kids in this environment moves them further down 'the spectrum', due to studies showing kids raised in gay households are more likely to be gay. I'll probably be downvoted for this comment, but it's looking at the issue logically.

Absolute nonsense. Link me to such a study from a reputable source (not something funded by say the Family Research Council). [This](http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/parenting-full.pdf) is a relatively conclusive review of previous psychological studies pertaining to LGBT parenting, that concludes there isn't a causation between parents' sexuality and that of their children.

&gt;A number of investigators have
also studied a third component of sexual identity,
sexual orientation (Bailey, Bobrow, Wolfe, &amp;
Mickach, 1995; Bozett, 1980, 1987, 1989; Gottman,
1990; Golombok &amp; Tasker, 1996; Green, 1978;
Huggins, 1989; Miller, 1979; Paul, 1986; Rees, 1979;
Tasker &amp; Golombok, 1997). In all studies, the great
majority of offspring of both lesbian mothers and
gay fathers described themselves as heterosexual.
Taken together, the data do not suggest elevated rates
of homosexuality among the offspring of lesbian or
gay parents. For instance, Huggins (1989) interviewed 36 adolescents, half of whom had lesbian
mothers and half of whom had heterosexual mothers. No children of lesbian mothers identified themselves as lesbian or gay, but one child of a heterosexual mother did; this difference was not statistically
significant. In another study, Bailey and his colleagues (1995) studied adult sons of gay fathers and
found more than 90% of the sons to be heterosexual.",0,1369073588,null,0,1369074011,0,ca2gvv8,t3_1eokd6,t1_ca2gvv8,t1_ca2d59x,null,1431094184,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

The story in my head is that it's a Dwemer traveling machine currently stuck in *Skyrim*, hidden inside a little run down cottage outside Riverwood. The whole thing is going to have a dungeon inside of it, partly inspired by *Journey to the Center of the TARDIS* and partly inspired by a nWoD game I ran for my ex that was inspired by *Doctor Who* (Hence why it's called the DEN instead of the TARDIS). If I go through with the whole thing, it'll have a quest attached where you explore the DEN and turn the power back on, which will let you travel around within Skyrim, the way the other TARDIS mod does.

As a gay person, it hurts. It physically hurts that I am being denied what I and many others feel is a basic human right to marry the person that I love. It hurts that in 2013 there is enough opposition in a house that is supposed to represent us - the people - to prevent gay marriage from becoming legal.

You said she is leaving the country soon.

true,scoutisimba,cnty-uk,Cambridge,"&gt;The European Court of Human Rights ruling a church HAS TO WED GAYS, against the churches wishes, in effect dictating to people what their religion should be.

That's not even true, but yes we do dictate what religion can do to some extent, of course. If your religion is to fly planes into building then the state won't allow that. 

&gt;Also, gay people being able to adopt. The last time this was discussed here people did link to studies that showed kids raised in gay households are more likely to be gay.

Even if this turns out to be true, so what? That's not an argument against gay marriage. 

&gt;Which, if you think about it makes sense. Some gays are gayer than others, for example. Or 'camper' or 'more feminin'. There must be a line of how gay a man is before he becomes bisexual, then another line before becoming fully straight.

You make out like all gays are like Mr.Humphries from are you being served. Nevermind that you've completely ignored women? 

&gt;Some of my mates have been with Thai ladyboys. They aren't actually gay but I think the 'spectrum of straight - bi - gay' they're closer to the bi range, although they don't like men, they like women with mens bits. I've told them this which annoys them, but makes sense if you think about it and they should just accept it.

Gay men are not at all attracted to *ladyboys*. I know first hand as I used to work in data analytics and one of the worse jobs I had was analysing viewer habits on porn websites. There's absolutely no crossover between people who view gay (male) content and those who view TG content. There is however a massive crossover between those who watch straight porn and those who watch TG. It can essentially be thought of as a fetish for people who identify as heterosexual males. 
  
&gt;The thing with raising kids in this environment moves them further down 'the spectrum', due to studies showing kids raised in gay households are more likely to be gay. 

Again, even if true, so what? That's only an issue if you think being a homosexual is somehow damaging.

Either way, the 507 number is not correct, but to me and a lot of other Whovians, when Davies tells us to take it as commentary we think he means to take it as a lot more than 13 and the FAQ along with some other Classic Who clues leads us to believe that now that the Time Lords are time-locked the regeneration limit is void.

If enough people agree to stop funding the same recycled events at the Cornex and the crappy clubs they will pretty soon have to start reaching out to local bands, giving them better slots, and pretty soon the public will enthuse about bands they've never heard of before. 
If, at the same time, people spend that same amount of money going to local gigs, buying their CDs and merch it'll fund their progress as well. £30 to see George Thorogood, (he's famous already, he doesn't need your money), could get you in to, (roughly), 3 local gigs with a CD from each.

Why?
1) If asked if you're married, as a gay person in a CP, you have to say 'No, but...' immediately disclosing your sexuality. Broadening CPs to hetro couples will mean that when answering the first question you  answer just that and only that.

2) The whole purpose of the bill is to create a more equal society - gays and straights should be able to demonstrate their commitment to their partner in the same number of ways. Both should be entitled to express this partnership in the same institutional manner. 

3) It allows secular non-religious people to express their partnership without religious connotations, which they might feel would be disingenuous. (Even marriage at a registry office is not entirely secular, reference to God is still made and religious language/terminology is still used.)

I'll be very interested to see what happens with this case.

Thankfully most drivers are fine (even if they don't know why we do certain things (taking lane for example)) but there's a sizeable minority of very aggressive drivers on our roads and nearly everyone that cycles will know what it's like when they pass you with centimetres to spare, or honk their horn while tailgating etc.

I can deal with it.  I'm young enough and strong enough.  But you child, your nan or your mother shouldn't have to put up with aggression just for riding a bike.

More education is needed in the driving test (and for current drivers) but the Police really need to start making examples of killers, rather than say [£35 and points for hitting and then dragging a cyclist on his bonnet, before smashing into a tree](http://road.cc/content/news/73826-taxi-driver-fined-%C2%A335-3-points-his-licence-after-cyclist-killed-collission).

This is hopefully until we pull our finger out of our backside and actually spend some money on cycling facilities, rather than deadly cycle lanes slopped down just to tick a box and spend a budget.

Huddlestone
BAE
Defoe
Gallas
Bentley
Livermore
Parker

**IN:**

- New left back. Not sure who, Luke Shaw would be great but he probably stays with Southampton, and even then he's a Chelsea fan. 

- Villa, Benteke or Damiao. We need a new striker, everyone knows that. I wouldn't be averse to shifting both Defoe and Adebayor but that seems unlikely, and Ade fits our system more, so I'm not opposed to him staying on for depth

- Son Heung-min or Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. We need a wide forward with pace but who can also supply more goals than Lennon. Wouldn't be opposed to either, although Son seems to be able to play anywhere across the front three whilst PEA seems more suited to playing down the right.

- A creative midfielder. Even though our squad was strengthened in some areas last year, it lost a lot of balance with the sale of Modric and VDV. We badly need creativity in the last third of the pitch, someone with an eye for a killer pass. Moutinho is obviously the dream but seems unlikely. Perhaps Cabaye.

- Back up defensive midfielder. We need cover for Sandro, and Parker hasn't been up to the job this season. Again, not really sure who, preferably a young prospect that wouldn't mind being understudy and switching in and out, playing cup games etc. Although, wouldn't mind Diame, who can cover the defense, but offer a bit more versatility and could rotate with Dembele (who we've half killed this season, he needs the occassional break).

Ideally, I'd like a lineup of: 

------------------Lloris--------------------

--Walker----Kaboul------Jan--------LB--

-----------Sandro------Moutinho---------

-----------------Dembele-----------------

--Bale------------------------------Son--

-------------------Villa--------------------

Of course, it helped that Eidur was incredibly intelligent on the ball and had the strength to hold onto it, shame about the off-the-pitch antics...

It worked outstandingly (this was very early on, when Drogba was taking his time to settle in). Here's a video of that season: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtmHj7zL4bM. There's a few classic goals towards the end displaying this kind of link up. Keep in mind how defensively sound that formation was under Mourinho (and with Fine Wine Makelele).

Why bring this up? In that system, the role of the striker as, in a sense, subordinate to those running channels either side (not being on the end of but *helping create* goal scoring chances) is obvious. Yet in our current system (4-2-3-1) I think the tactical relation between striker and the 3 behind is much less clear. Certainly, it is not a clear cut case (not that I'm saying this is being suggested) of a striker *enabling* others rather than being *enabled*. Ideally you want that to go both ways in a 4-2-3-1, or at least more so than in a 4-3-3.

Now, let's say Mourinho comes back - I think he might tweak our formation more toward 4-3-3 depending on the type of striker Chelsea sign or look to implement. I can't see a good case being made for just sticking with our current set of strikers.

I wouldn't say that there will be less cars on the road. People will still want their own vehicle and I am sure the car manufacturers will market it as such (making them more money).

As far as vested interests go, the major player in this are insurance companies. Everyone who drives is required to have insurance, which coincidentally is a lot of people paying a lot of money. Why would we need car insurance if we are not driving? In theory this will save people (especially men) a large amount of money each year, however I doubt this will go unnoticed for long.

I do not think civil partnerships should be available to heterosexual couples, and I also do not think they should be available to homosexual couples, because I do not see the need for a two tier system.

We should celebrate civil partnerships as an important aid for the slightly less progressive members of our society to get used to the idea of homosexuality, but we shouldn't let them hold us back from reaching full equality.

I'm not gay and I am already married, so none of this would affect me directly; however, I would like a say in how our society is formed.

Shoving a dash-cam in every taxed vehicle is seriously problematic from a technical standpoint (what if it fails? How often is it tested? What's a compliant camera and mount position? Do you have to retrofit to old cars? What if they're weird and can't be compliant?). The other issue is retention - how much footage is retained, and are we talking a rolling-six-hour-buffer or regularly swapped chunks? Once it's taken, what happens then - does it all get sent to police regularly (troubling for privacy, see below) or do you have to present it on request? What's to stop you subbing in (say) a faked-up tape after an accident, or indeed just taking a quick trip to visit an old uni friend in Scotland which will roll straight over the buffered period, just after hitting someone?

My larger concern is rights/privacy-based, given the attitude and nature of UK law I'd be more worried about the legal mandate for everyone to carry a tiny CCTV around. The Powers That Be have shown a strong willingness to soak up every bit of data they can find, for every conceivable purpose, and dashcams would provide effective location tracking of everyone driving, all the time, regardless of location (and jurisdiction). Further, what sort of offences would the footage be admissible for? Could the police demand your dash tapes for an accident you witnessed but weren't involved in? Or indeed if you drove past an incident in the street that wasn't related to motoring at all? Could the police just demand tapes without a warrant, for speculative dragnets to spot minor road-traffic offences without safety implications? 

I feel like the technical problems are probably surmountable (though the rolling-buffer-erasure problem will definitely exist until you have Really Big buffer sizes). The rights problems, on the other hand, require us to have a Big Discussion about whether we want what amounts to vehicle tracking and a truly universal CCTV network, and I come down on the side of not trusting UK governments with our privacy.",0,1369086956,null,0,false,0,ca2lts3,t3_1ephoy,t1_ca2lts3,t1_ca2kpjg,null,1431091843,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

true,Ivebeenfurthereven,cnty-uk,"Living by the sea [Southampton via Sussex, Southsea and Swansea]","I answered some other comments with a similar theme a second ago, so first I'll just quote myself to save on keyboard wear! 

&gt;See, I'm strongly against GPS tracking for insurance (as well as basic ""They shouldn't have the rights to all my travels"" objection, I also firmly believe it'd be used to up premiums for everyone - ""Dodgy area of town?"" ""Out late at night?"" ""Travelling on rural roads? Tut tut...""), but I really don't think this need be the same at all.

&gt;Unlike the GPS tracker, a dashcam system doesn't need to be constantly streaming back to a database - it can work like an aircraft 'black box', storing say a week's worth of info until the authorities actually need to look at it, at which point they physically access the recordings from your car (with appropriate court permission, like a search warrant). It doesn't need to be connected to the internet at all. That way, there's no government log of what everyone in the country is doing, just local storage that can be accessed if that particular car is involved in an incident.

I believe that that setup, if properly controlled, largely eliminates the very valid 'database' concerns - they should *not* be streaming, and therefore, the authorities would have no way of tracking every car at once - which is a completely different issue. They should act in isolation, just like aircraft crash recorders. The police may access a few cars at a time, when it's relevant to a specific case, and would need a warrant from a court to do so. 

Yes, that would include witnesses to incidents (seriously, when there's a motorway pile-up and the police appeal for witnesses, the off-chance it was caught on a dashcam are a Godsend as it is), but no, dragnetting would be prohibited - the police cannot use dragnet techniques in the UK for any other crime, this would be no different. As I say, every access would need to be in reference to a specific incident.

The 'trip to Scotland to erase an offence' problem is a valid one, but again, surmountable - set a fixed time until recordings are overwritten (a week or two), make it so that this is controlled by time and not mileage (ie, sudden bursts of activity don't overwrite old material faster). With 32GB microSD cards being as cheap as they are, I don't think that's a likely technical issue.

To answer your other points, functionality testing could easily be handled as part of the MOT (with no ability to read or write memory, to prevent shenanigans - it just needs a port that can output error codes), and I don't know if it'd be retrofitted but even if it was new-cars-only, society would see benefits in a few years.",0,1369088291,null,0,1369088500,0,ca2mb6c,t3_1ephoy,t1_ca2mb6c,t1_ca2lts3,null,1431091616,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

On youth, I don't think his record is spectacular but I'm not too worried. Mourinho is above all a pragmatist, he will bring players through if they are actually good enough.

For transfers, if he can check his ego at the door and agree to work under our current system he would be great. I think overall he's had both failures and successes in the market and he's always enjoyed a massive budget. If Mourinho can let the club handle most of the signings and just focus on the football that could be best, even if he doesn't like the lack of control.

I totally agree that his behaviour at Madrid is something to be concerned about though. I understand the vitriolic atmosphere there but that club is maybe the biggest in the world, and he has single handedly tried to destroy it from within. Maturity, professionalism, excellence...you can't talk about any of that when looking at his last few months at Madrid. Who is to say he won't bring this same act to Chelsea? The only difference would be that instead of the mad Florentino he would come up against the Russian butcher. In contrast to Fergie, Wenger, Carlo - Jose puts himself before his club.

Overall, despite coming with baggage I would love to have him back. I think in his first year we would walk the league and probably win a domestic cup. But no way The Special One lasts more than three years, the second things go south with Jose you end up frozen in Antarctica.

We signed up the European Convention of Human Rights, singed by every European country (including Russia, Turkey and other non-EU members).

Under the European Convention on Human Rights there is a *positive* duty to enforce the prohibition of torture. That means that not only is the state not allowed to torture people with its own hands, but it must also enforce the prohibition of torture.

This has been held to mean that a person cannot be deported to his home country if it is reasonably expected he will face torture there (or death, which is also a *positive* right). This meaning has been held in British courts, not just the European Court of Human Rights.

So if courts, both domestic and European, have ruled that it is illegal to deport someone to their home country if they face torture then the states hands are tied (voluntarily tied- it was Parliament's intention in enacting the Human Rights Act). People are way too easily whipped into a frenzy over cases such as that of Abu Qatada. These are extremely rare cases, yet many bring them up as a counterpoint against the Human Rights Act and the European Convention on Human Rights.

true,snurtje53,null,null,"As someone who works with personal CCTV devices, one of the major problem you're going to face there is to do with storage.

Dash cams you get commercially right now typically record in overrwite mode at a pretty high quality (i'll get to why in a minute) for about a maximum of 2 hours (generally). This is because when you *want* to have evidence of a crash, the evidence is usually pretty recent. For this kind of storage, however, this incident has probably going to have occurred a while ago. Lets say, 48 hours (I think this is pretty optimistic myself, but others may disagree)

 8 hours of 480p footage takes about 8 gb of storage, from our experience. Footage at this quality from a dashboard point of view is either narrowly focused enough to allow you to read numberplates, or widely focused enough to see everything across the bonnet , albeit in poor detail. 24 hours (32gb SD card) is probably not going to cut it, and might be at too low a quality to be useful.

Magnetic disk storage (i.e. your regular hard drive) are large enough but they are not particularly good for applications where you may be moving. The disks are quite fragile to movement. As you can imagine, during a crash there can be some quite large forces involved. As a result of this, you're probably not going to be able to rely on regular disks.

Black boxes on airplanes obviously manage to do this somehow, don't they? Problem is, nearest estimate I can see is that they cost more than £10000 each. 

And on the issue of cost, whose going to foot the bill? Is this going to be part of every new car? Thereby driving the prices of new vehicles up? And when it fails, are you going to have to pay for a new one? Many, many motorists would be against this purely because it's expensive enough to drive already.

I think he has an unending supply of clever ideas, and they're really very good, but nowadays he tries to cram them into 45 minute episodes, which makes them lean on exposition and feel rushed.

However, even when rushing his stories, he has certainly stayed true to his own grand themes.

The justification for this amendment being rejected is that there should be a review of civil partnerships, and quite possibly the whole idea of them could be thrown down the drain when this bill passes. There are also a load of boring technical details which are problematic and need to be sorted out.

true,hexapodium,null,null,"&gt;I believe that that setup, if properly controlled, largely eliminates the very valid 'database' concerns - they should not be streaming, and therefore, the authorities would have no way of tracking every car at once - which is a completely different issue. 

The problem's not that they're not streaming; it's that you could pretty easily dump raw footage into a computer vision system, have it run point recognition on visible features, and reverse-engineer journey tracking. 'Every car at once' is a scalability question, and even after-the-fact tracking is a huge invasion of privacy. There would likely be a challenge under the right to a private life clause of the EU Convention on Human Rights.

&gt; The police may access a few cars at a time, when it's relevant to a specific case, and would need a warrant from a court to do so.

Warrants don't work like that (if you find evidence of crime Y while executing search warrants on the basis of suspected crime X, you can still prosecute Y + X separately). Also, as a motoring question, and a 'privilege not a right'-style paradigm in law, you most likely would *not* need a warrant (or a reduced-basis one at least) to demand the footage, much the same way as a policeman can stop you on 'reasonable suspicion' and breathalyse you; or conduct a vehicle search on 'reasonable suspicion' under SOCPA 2005 (can't remember which section). The law would have to be heavily rewritten to assuage concerns, and it's much easier to implement technology than to repeal laws. 

&gt;Yes, that would include witnesses to incidents (seriously, when there's a motorway pile-up and the police appeal for witnesses, the off-chance it was caught on a dashcam are a Godsend as it is), but no, dragnetting would be prohibited - the police cannot use dragnet techniques in the UK for any other crime, this would be no different. As I say, every access would need to be in reference to a specific incident.

Obviously, motorway pileups would be a valid circumstance. But in these cases, the police appeal for, rather than compel, testimony. If there was a presumption that everyone had a dashcam, then it would be much more plausible legally for the police to start from the crashing dashcam, and then work from number plates to demand hundreds of tapes from hundreds of drivers, for evidence purposes. That's invasive anyway, and again they could dragnet the tapes (already got them, remember!) for other offences at will.

Your more general claim about dragnetting is also false - police ANPR schemes are quite pervasive around my hometown (Warwickshire area) and are targeted at any and all motoring offences outstanding. As previously stated, the law on driving is based on different assumptions because it's a privilege not a right - part of holding a driving licence is submitting to these lower standards for warranted search etc. 

Furthermore, what about non-motoring offences? If (say) your car was seen on CCTV pointed at an out-of-view incident, would that be grounds to compel your tape? Consider the following:

1. You're on your way to buy drugs. You're caught on camera, driving there.
2. Your dashcam captures footage of a stabbing. You haven't bought your drugs yet.
3. The police respond after-the-fact to the stabbing. They review CCTV and determine that you have footage of the stabbing.
4. You buy some drugs, out of view of public CCTV (you wouldn't get caught)
5. The police compel footage of the stabbing from you. Incidentally, the rest of the tape contains evidence of you buying drugs. 

What should be done about this? Should the camera log be valid evidence for crimes committed outside of the remit of motoring offences, either by the vehicle owner or by others? This could potentially be fixed by giving owners' lawyers (or owners) a right to review and redact any recording they wish before turning it over - which might prove useful for evidentiary purposes in crashes etc, but would defeat the object of catching dangerous drivers. But not giving the owner rights over their own footage could turn every vehicle into a personal policeman. 

&gt;The 'trip to Scotland to erase an offence' problem is a valid one, but again, surmountable - set a fixed time until recordings are overwritten (a week or two), make it so that this is controlled by time and not mileage (ie, sudden bursts of activity don't overwrite old material faster). With 32GB microSD cards being as cheap as they are, I don't think that's a likely technical issue.

Fair enough. I was more concerned with the idea that any long drive would put time on the clock (surely one wouldn't expect it to record while the engine is off? That would be technically impractical, plus invasive if one parks in view of the house). 32GB doesn't go terribly far when you're putting raw footage down, though I expect compressed formats would be valid. However, compression makes tampering easier as well. 

&gt;functionality testing could easily be handled as part of the MOT

Functional tests as part of the MOT are all well and good, but is camera failure to be considered equivalent to an MOT-fail condition (you can't pass the next one) or a 'unroadworthy vehicle' condition (you can't drive on it)? Unroadworthiness is a pretty distant bar for most cars, far in excess of MOT failure. To add a delicate electronic component to the list would be very out of line with existing policy. Additionally, what about silent failures (dust on lens, parking permit covers lens, exceptional errors, faulty card etc?) which don't report the error? These seem problematic.

&gt; (with no ability to read or write memory, to prevent shenanigans - it just needs a port that can output error codes)

That sound is the Data Protection Act Violation Klaxon going off - you have an absolute right to know of and review your own data (as a dashcam would likely qualify as personally-identifying information), except for the purposes of national security or where that information is being used as part of an ongoing active criminal investigation. Since neither threshold is met, you'd have to have a ""dump"" mode. You would also likely become a Data Controller under the provisions of the same Act, and have to allow others access to footage of their own vehicles (because it would personally identify them) under the same provision. This would be an enormous burden on everyone. Most likely you'd need a government agency to handle everyone's tapes, and that is a Bad Thing since we've grown used to losing laptops etc, and government departments may freely share data among themselves through secondary legislation. Your concerns and solutions about warrants would then become moot - the police would just ask politely. Plus, you would also have a right to *delete* any of your own personally-identifying information unless it was demanded with a warrant, at any time including just after a crash. If you had established a history of purging all data regularly, then you would have a good defence against any conspiracy to pervert the course of justice claim in reference to deleting data about an accident, if you did so before a warrant was served to you. 

**TL;DR**: as with all things, the most powerful bit of legislation ever invented is the Data Protection Act. It is a massive pain, and it will sink almost all Big Data efforts.

Essentially, since I have to share the road with other road users, it'd be *nice* if they didn't try to pick and choose which rules they obey. One of the things that makes roads safe is that since you're all following the same rules, it ought to be relatively easy to predict what other road users are going to do. If you stop following the rules, you're putting yourself in danger, and I don't fancy picking up the pieces if/when it all goes wrong.

**TL;DR: Driverless cars would be like the destruction of ""public transport"" and freedoms of mode of travel by car manufacturers in the USA but in a massive and irreparable way forever.**

A driverless car future is a really scary one **without the proper societal rules in place before deployment**.

The majority of people already have ""driverless"" cars. They are called buses, trains, boats and aeroplanes.

Unless the project is open source (and if I could dream, non-for-profit), I believe no government or private company would make driverless cars ""a benefit to society"".

That is a marketing slogan for people to part with their money and freedoms.
It's also most likely that non-driverless ""old fashioned"" cars would also be banned from the streets once driver-less takes the majority hold.

Let us use Google, the market leader as an example of some incentives which will come with driverless cars.

Remember, Google is an **advertising** company first and foremost. I would do this if I were them to get back money lost for ""R&amp;D"" of the technology. I'm certainly sure that Google (or any other private company) would do the same.. 

* **Sign up service to start tracking all your movement and data.**
* **Governmental partnership for tracking movements.**
* **Advertising on every side of the vehicle.**  
Think of the targeted audience data you will get with the sign-up service. You would know where every car would go and every person, age group and any other demographic in the car are heading to. Sell that information at a massive price to other companies.
* **Fast track / Premium routes.**  
Remember, you lost control of the vehicle now that you can't drive. You are at the mercy of how much you can pay to get to a place faster. Don't forget, time is money!!
* **Scrapped ""no advertising"" rules for motorways.**  
This rule is in force because adverts distract drivers while driving on the motorway. Expect USA-style ""freeways"" to come around.
* **Tolls in the form of stops at ""McB"".**  
No driving means you are like cattle to be fed. ""This service is stopping at ""McB"" to smoothen out the flow of traffic. Would you like a ""McB"" with that while you wait?"" Brilliant!
* **Free-nium subscriptions.**  
A sole car just to carry you? No, no, no. Thats the 2nd tier paid subscription package (not including luggage). You will have to wait 30 mins for the next car to be available to you. It will be shared with 3 other people. It will stop at all McBs.
* **No more AA ""breakdown"" service at a fast / speedy time for you, ""the driver"".**  
AA fixes cars for driverless car companies now. They have no need to rush to your aid to fix the vehicle which has broken down. What would happen is that the car would stop and wait for everyone to leave the vehicle while you wait for the next freenium transport to pick you up. That ""broken"" car would dock at a service depot for itself to be fixed while you must make your way somehow to your destination or wait for another car. (Don't forget, the route to your destination is not direct anymore, rather it is based upon advertising revenue!)

Now the doctor has stated that he didn't know how he survived the time war. As in it was never his intention to be the last remaining time lord. The moment should have for all intents and purpose killed him to. That is what made that moment something acceptable for the doctor, it was genocide, but to save the universe. The fact that he did survive is what bothers the 9th doctor. The now new 9th doctor (Hurt) probably did something that would save him and not the rest. Or that was something he set out to do. Or mayby Hurt did do the genocide of the Daleks and Timelords, meaning he couldn't be the doctor any more. In the name of peace and sanity. But he was the only one that regenareted being as he was in the center of it all. Which is why the eccelstone Doctor is so regretful, he doesn't think he deserves to live.

First thing after that would be to sign players down the middle of the field.  A CB to replace/rotate with Luiz, Cahill, Terry and Brana.  I would also look into buying a squad RB to both ""replace"" Paulo.  I would slowly transition the team into more of a 4-3-3 and knowing that my anchors are set with Mikel, Essien and Romeu I would look into finding maybe one more player for squad depth there.  I would then search for players who can play centrally but also are slightly more attacking focused.  These players would pair in the middle three with Mata and Oscar (first choice) and Lampard, and KDB.  I would leave LW alone with Hazard and Bertrand, and try to find another player for RW.  Although Mata and Oscar can play wide as well as Ramires, I would want to find another RW for both depth and for a different option, another playmaker.

The ongoing theme here is to add depth with quality.  Knowing that we could realistically be playing another 60 games next year dependent on cup progression we would need to develop a much deeper team.  By looking at the successful teams in Europe and England, one thing is clear.  Talent at the top level we are equal, from the bench down we struggle.  I would love to see players like Ake get more playing time in some of the lower level EPL games and rest players like Luiz and Mikel for our bigger games.

Note he says ""From Gallifrey to Trenzalore"". Which can include any amount of time he was living on Gallifrey. Also, the Other was one of the three, alongside Rassilon and Omega who established Time Lord Society and made travel through time possible. So IF The Doctor was in fact originally the Other, then that damage would be reflected as well.

When the Doctor is explaining about choosing a name, the wording he uses is very specific.

""The name **you** choose, it’s like a promise you make. He's the one that broke *the* promise”. He emphasized the **you** as a way of making Clara understand what he's trying to convey. And he says ""the"" promise, not ""that"" promise. There is a significant difference in those two words in that context. 

I took it to it to mean, in this context, that ""breaking the promise"" was an analogy to the act, and the resulting damage to The Doctor as a person. 

John Hurt, whoever he may end up being, did something, or did not do something, that went against who he was as a person. His personal moral and ethical code. And as a result, (IMO) every incarnation since, has been trying, as The Doctor, the name he chose, to atone for it.

So he goes about killing them one by one. Then he drops the moniker/name of the Doctor and takes up the name the Valeyard.


BUT this was before the time war, in the original run there was no time war, so the current theory is this incarnation may be the regeneration the is called the Valeyard.

And we know that Time Lords see the whole of time and space when they're children, so he would have known for his whole life ""in the future, I destroy all of time and space"". And the John Hurt Doctor says ""what I did, I did in the name of peace and sanity"". The Daleks still exist, but there are no Time Lords other than the Doctor (who they do not remember) to oppose them. They can use humans (at least) to make other Daleks. They make insane, uncontrollable Daleks, but the planet they use as an asylum has been destroyed. The Daleks are described as insane. In the episode Nightmare in Silver, Porridge explains how the only way the Human Empire destroyed the Cybermen was by destroying their home galaxy. A human empire had the technology to destroy a whole galaxy, and the technology to destroy a planet with a bomb the size of a large suitcase. Surely, a Time Lord could manage a bigger boom.

My theory, spinning off from yours, is that the John Hurt Doctor is in the Doctor's future, and uses some kind of weapon to destroy all of space to stop the Daleks, who are insane ('what I did, I did in the name of sanity...') and violent ('... and peace').

true,asdfghjklemons,EN,england,"* Terry **would not** suit a 3-5-2. You want pacy centre-backs in the system.  
* Also without fullbacks, we'd completely lack any width, and wouldn't have a single winger in the starting line-up.
* Cole is two years younger than Lamps, and still one of the best left-backs in the world. Lampard could be replaced in terms of technical ability, I'm not sure Cole could at the moment.
* Azpi wouldn't suit a 3-man defence, he's a full-back.
* Lampard and Luiz aren't holding midfielders, which is what you'd need with this formation. Lampard needs someone to hold back and cover him, allowing him to do what he does best, and make late runs forward. Luiz isn't there yet. 
* Offensively, I couldn't see this working brilliantly either. Having two players who prefer to play the no.10 role out on the wings will give us no back up plan if we can't pass our way through. 

Sorry for seeming blunt, in what's just a suggestion thread, but just putting out my two cents on us playing a 3-5-2 formation. We're a long was from a 3-5-2 style team.

true,sinistersuperspy,tardis,TARDIS,"""On the Fields of Trenzalore, at the fall of the Eleventh, when no creature can speak falsely or fail to answer, a question will be asked — a question that must never ever be answered: ""Doctor who?""

The entire season has been fuelled by what Dorium Maldovar stated at the end of ""The Wedding of River Song"". 

Dorium: The first question. The question that must never be answered, hidden in plain sight. The question you've been running from all your life. Doctor who? Doctor who? Doctor Who.

None of this, nor any of the breadcrumbs left by Moffat throughout the series has indicated that The Doctor has any unresolved issues with The Last Great Time War. Hell, the guy has a large, friendly looking book prominently displayed in his TARDIS' library **FOR ANYONE TO SEE**.

The guys over at [RASSILON, OMEGA, and that OTHER Guy](http://meshyfish.com/~roo/index.html) have, for years, diligently catalogued the entire history of Doctor Who through all mediums: TV, movie, books, etc. 

In the long, and very detailed section on the Time War, there is no margin for ambiguity regarding the Eighth and then Ninth Doctors role in the direction the Time War took. There is no indication whatsoever, that the Doctor ever did anything so heinous, as to hide a part of himself away. 

We have seen it, in the show, how each incarnation has addressed it with companions etc, since 2005. 

A lot of people also forget, that Steven Moffat has been a die-hard Who fan since Day One. He's been extremely diligent and careful about inclusion of All Who. Tying in Classic bits with NuWho. 

It is highly unlikely for him (IMO) to crowbar another regeneration into the middle of a story that is now 7 years on just to ""shake things up"". That's a very risky and dangerous game to play in any creative medium.

It's also something to consider, that when Moffat has written an episode (say for example The Name of The Doctor) he has always been very careful about what is said, the way it is said, and in what context it is said.

Basically the doctor was put on trial in gallifrey for breaking their laws with time/space/event intervention or whatever. The Valeyard is the prosecutor and the doctor tries to defend himself from the accusations. The valeyard used 3 previous episodes as evidence against the doctor, but the doctor notes that the video of the events had been tampered with. On the screen the Master appears and basically explains why the whole conspiracy has taken place and who the valeyard is because a) he loves mocking gallifreys government , and b) he hates the valeyard more then he hates the doctor because he views him as a evil alter ego who is no longer governed by compassion. Tl;dr the valeyard is an alter of the doctor that takes place between his 11 and 12 regenerations (or 12 and 13th.. Can't remember)

You can transfer $10,000 a year out of Canada a year, no questions asked, tax free etc (above that there are issues, so personally if you have more than $10k, I'd just transfer it out bit at a time - you'll get a better interest rate in Canada anyway). Talk to TD about wiring it (I bank with them and they've been very helpful with all my wiring woes), you need to have an account in the UK to send it to and they'll charge a flat rate to send (about $30) and a flat rate to receive about (£10). If you have family in the UK you're close with the best thing is to send the money to them in advance, then start a new account when you land in the UK using a cheque that your family have written you. If that isn't an option then you will be able to use your TD debit or credit card in the UK until you get paid etc although I don't know how you'd go about transferring a large amount of money, I assume you can do it over the phone, although I've never needed to myself. If you feel like living dangerously you can take all the money out as a money order or bankers draft and take it on the plane with you...


NHS is a massive free for all compared to healthcare in Canada, there is a lot less paperwork around it, just head to your nearest GP to register, personally I've never registered until I actually need to see the doctor, but this is probably not the most responsible thing to do and it does annoy the receptionist quite a bit.


You're moving to London, you don't need a car, but contact the DVLA and they'll swap your license for a UK one (this is worth doing asap as its useful for ID for collecting packages/buying alcohol/etc, people will accept a canadian license but they'll get confused). You might want to think about taking your test again in a manual car though, automatics in the UK are rare (and as a result more expensive to buy and service) and you won't be able to drive a manual until you do (also our roads are entirely different to canadian ones, as my colleague who visited the UK once said to me 'you're driving down a road, and someone else is driving straight at you and then you just pull into a gap to let them by at the last minute!!!'.)

I'd think Toure's wage is just a straight swap for Carragher. If they were willing to re-sign Carragher for two more years, then they wouldn't have a problem paying somebody like Kolo Toure the same amount.

But back to comparing Toure and Williams - there aren't many ways of cutting the numbers on the two deals where they don't work out about the same - simply because our days of making £20M+ signings and putting them on £70-80k per week of wages for 5.5 years are long over. 

My main point though was that you can't introduce financials to the argument about evaluating who to sign and only discuss the transfer fee. Transfer fee is 10% of the story. There are contracts, length, amortization, asset value, agent fees, signon fees, image rights, and a whole lot more. See [my post from last year](http://reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/xtd3z/a_guide_to_calculating_the_real_cost_of_players/)

The other issue is that 'free signing' is a misnomer. No signing is free, especially not a Bosman transfer. This is exactly what happen with Joe Cole, it wasn't just that his wages were ridiculous, but that we also paid a ridiculous signon fee and agent bonus for him, which totalled over £6M. We aren't signing Toure without laying out near £3M or more.

Yeah, people are being limited in their imaginations by all the old stuff that is kind of outdated now. 

I'm not sure what is going to happen with the Valeyard, the current producers have said that a lot of the Time Lord backstory from the classic series is not going to be used in the new one because people don't remember it (which I think is bunk) other than The Master and a few bits and pieces. So The Rani, the Meddling Monk and so forth are probably never going to be seen again. 

The shout out to the Valeyard was pure fan service. I imagine that he's not going to return either. Hurt's character is almost certainly going to be some other unmentioned regeneration of The Doctor, or a split off of him like Valeyard, The Dream Lord and The Watcher. I don't think they'd waste the opportunity to come up with something interesting and new, especially using Hurt. But I could be wrong.

Personally I think the events that happened after Trial of a Time Lord negated the potential for the Valeyard to come into existence.

Also, since the Doctor now claims to have over 500 regenerations (in an episode of the spin off series Sarah Jane Adventures) he will not come to desire more regenerations around his 12th, as was the explanation for the Valeyard's origin. 

So I dunno, but I think fans are a bit hooked up in assumptions that no longer have any relevance to the current form of Doctor Who. ",0,1369103512,null,0,false,0,ca2rv9i,t3_1emoai,t1_ca2rv9i,t1_ca2hv8u,null,1431088996,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2
