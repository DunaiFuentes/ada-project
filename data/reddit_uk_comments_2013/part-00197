&gt;In the year 1930, John Maynard Keynes predicted that, by century’s end, technology would have advanced sufficiently that countries like Great Britain or the United States would have achieved a 15-hour work week. There’s every reason to believe he was right. In technological terms, we are quite capable of this. And yet it didn’t happen. Instead, technology has been marshaled, if anything, to figure out ways to make us all work more. In order to achieve this, jobs have had to be created that are, effectively, pointless. Huge swathes of people, in Europe and North America in particular, spend their entire working lives performing tasks they secretly believe do not really need to be performed. The moral and spiritual damage that comes from this situation is profound. It is a scar across our collective soul. Yet virtually no one talks about it.

Notice he said he did things to offend  (reinforcing his ""rebel"" to authority anti ""politicly correct""  image) that ""I didn't necessarily believe in"" (not ""I don't"") and only category denies being involved in right wing politics (not that he doesn't agree with it). 

To me it doesn't so much matter if he still holds those views or not but that he declined to categorically say he doesn't and that they are wrong. Instead he used it to further his image and appeal to a base that might be attracted to those ideas with out outright stating them and upsetting those who don't. Masterful politicking for what it's worth but disturbing.   ",0,1379667741,null,0,false,0,ccbyvrj,t3_1mrkdd,t1_ccbyvrj,t1_ccbyf4a,null,1429401701,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

What has probably happened is that they have simply cancelled the direct debit and the service provider are continuing to provide and building up arrears, which they will then expect the previous tenant to settle. However the only contact details they will have is now your house, at which point they will probably get a bit threatening to you about paying for the service provided.

The result was they took the ball off him quickly, or he turned and passed back to Mignolet. 

Once he even got the ball in an attacking position mid-way into the Swansea half. They closed him down and he turned and ran fifty yards back before passing it to Mignolet. 

Mignolet soon got the message and for the second half I don't remember him making any short passes, but kicked it long every time he had possession, and of course every time he did it just gave the ball back to Swansea.

While I think Mignolet could have tried other options with the centre halves split wide, or Henderson could have come back to offer another option from time to time, the root problem was the ease with which Swansea were able to undermine Mignolet's confidence in Wisdom as the spare man.

The only cultural thing I can think off is that in East Africa everything takes forever to get done. Don't know whether to categorize that as a de jure or de facto cultural difference but he should be prepared for it and to not get frustrated. If he hasn't already he should try to pick up a little Kiswahili, although with three weeks to go I don't know how much he could. I found this more helpful because it ingratiates you to locals when trying to form dialogues rather than that it helps smooth out communication. (It does to a certain extent but the limited amount he will know will often not be much help) Edinburgh University has a [Swahili club](http://swahiliclub.eusa.ed.ac.uk/Home.html) that accepts all comers, might be worth him dropping by even for any questions he has about East African culture.

Edited: I just got a reply from foxproject.org.uk and this is what they said: ' This is clearly a juvenile and we're presently going through the annual dispersal season where four to five month old youngsters are moving away - or being driven away - from their family groups.  In the process, they sometimes become temporarily disorientated and settle in odd places for a few days while they think things through.  A compost heap is a useful source of small prey such as insects, beetles, worms etc., so I can see that attraction.  And foxes will always be interested in natural prey like rabbits if they are not housed.  No - RSPCA would not be interested.as they are an animal rescue group and this isn't about rescue.  I attach our fox deterrence leaflet - containing both DIY and call-out service options.  The associated consultancies listed at end of leaflet all operate in the London area if you prefer the latter option.'

The mother was in tears, they obviously couldn't afford to pay, this was her sons wedding and Ryanair weren't budging one bit, in fact they were being extremely rude, even calling it a fine. A fine for what exactly, them changing the rules overnight? It was turning into a pretty nasty shouting match. Next step I presume would be Ryanair calling security and this family going nowhere. 

Anyway some guy who'd just checked into one of those first class fast track queues ( Quantas I think it was ) came over, butted in, pulled out his card and paid this ""fine"" on the spot to huge applause from the all the people standing in line.  He just said: Oh it's OK, I can just write it off against expenses. The Ryanair staff just looked at the guy in disgust like he'd done something wrong, almost like they wanted this family to fuck up.

Maybe porridge for breakfast. If you can bake your own bread that would be cheaper than buying it, as well. 

Big bags of frozen veggie burgers are fairly cheap and can be chopped up to bulk out meals, but I wouldn't go much on their nutritional value. 

Blag a sunday roast or occasional extra evening meal from friends by buying a cheap-ish bottle of wine to contribute or offering to wash up and being a generally good guest. Or if you've got a few friends that all chip in to buy an unethically raised chicken and some vegetables, you could probably have a decent hot meal for about a quid each.

We're still transitioning into AVB's 4-3-3, and EVERYONE is going to need time to develop chemistry, not just the new faces. Sigurdsson hasn't played with Lamela, Soldado, Eriksen, Capoue, Paulinho nor Chadli before, all of whom operate in the same half of the pitch. Our entire front six has been overhauled, and there will be a steeper learning curve for those incumbents than our defense's, who only have to adjust to Chiriches. Soldado will make different runs than Adebayor. Lamela will cross the ball to a different spot than Bale. Capoue and Paulinho will recycle the ball differently than Parker or Huddlestone.

I think Gylfi and Holtby have adjusted just fine into the new season thus far; certainly better than some of the other incumbents (cough, Lennon). I can even see Gylfi supplanting Chadli on the left wing. Let the squad gel. Our offense hasn't even scratched the surface of its potential yet. When it does, and you can bet it will, Gylfi will be involved.",0,1379683058,null,0,false,0,ccc108a,t3_1mqh5p,t1_ccc108a,t1_ccbnpjg,null,1429400639,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

Having that capability is a political tool rather than a military one, which provides a certain level of bargaining power on the international stage. 

There's an argument to be made that nuclear cruise missiles that could be launched from fighters, ships or submarines, and a small handful of hardened silos, would be a far more effective second strike capability, as that's far more targets than just four submarines. However, you've then got the massive logistical and security problem of running a military that's got several nuclear options. 

What *might* be a cheaper and similarly effective solution is to retire the Vanguard subs, but admit to having a few nuclear armed tomahawks on Astute subs, but not saying which ones, where or when, and making it clear that there is also a very strong possibility that nuclear Storm Shadow missiles could be assembled in a short space of time too. Basically, doing what Israel does and saying 'well, yeah, we have nukes, but guess where and what and how many, suckers!'

It's probably still sensible to keep *some* sort of second strike capability, and also facilities to fairly quickly tool up further, but the Trident subs are a bit of a last century solution.",0,1379683108,null,0,false,0,ccc10n7,t3_1mmu6b,t1_ccc10n7,t3_1mmu6b,null,1429400634,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

true,NN76,null,null,"Just starting my second year at Queens so here is my guide.
LIVING
Good choice with elms, I've met some of my current closest friends there. If you lock yourself out of your room it is not as big as a deal as some are making out. Just go to reception and get a new one. I think I had to get 5 new ones and paid 50p at the end of the year because I didn't return a few. 
In regards to who you are living with, I have to say I personally had an amazing group of people and I was very lucky! However my friends who were in other parts were not so fortunate. Expect to be woken up but if it gets to the point where you can't sleep (happen to my friend she was getting on average 3hrs a night) don't take it. Get up and tell them to go and fuck off. You live there too. At that also be constantly considerate of other people if you're someone who likes to party yourself.
Keep the kitchen tidy so the cleaners keep cleaning the oven/cooker etc. 

FOOD
Next week if you have a fiver spare go and eat at Boojum or Build a Burger. You'll thank me for it. 

BARS
My personal favourites are Cuckoo on the Lisburn road, Speakeasy in the SU, The Elms just past the SU. Great drink offers and always a pleasant crowd. Cuckoo have something on every night of the week and £3 cocktails if you have a wristband (I can guarantee you will get one next week). Take full advantage of The Speakeasy, the price of drinks in there is fantastic! The Elms has a lovely atmosphere and play great music, they also usually have a 'spirit of the week/month' which is always a good price.

NIGHT CLUBS
Must admit I'm not very experienced in the field, I'm more of a pub person but I'll give my experience. 
You will go to BOX Craics Ninety night at least once in the coming weeks. Every drink is 90p. Great offer but it's £6 in and is usually packed. BOX has two floors with two different styles of music. Bottom is more chart music and the top is more remixes etc
If you want a safe night Union on a Monday is great. Full of first years like yourself and usually a nice crowd with no bother with bouncers etc. It has ok drink offers and fantastic music.
You should also try Stiff Kitten and Limelight!

THINGS TO DO
Every cinema has a £3 night. QFT has it on a Monday if you want to see films you wouldn't see in a 'normal cinema', fantastic spot where you can even have a drink before hand! Movie House has their £3 night on a Tuesday. This is always busy but they have a massive range of films so not really a problem. Their snacks like popcorn is also not very expensive. 
Every society also have nights to meet and of course if you're into sport you'll be able to meet people through that. 
You can also learn a language in McClay for £20 a semester which is amazing. They pretty much teach any language you can think off in varying levels.

SAVING MONEY
Best way to save money and to make good friends is to sit in some nights. Sounds boring but it really isn't. Sit in and drink or sit in and watch a film. Great way to break ice.
ALWAYS predrink before a night out so that you aren't buying a lot when you are out. 

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO DURING FRESHERS
Go to the union connected night on Monday.
Do not miss the RAG pub crawl, buy a tshirt as soon as you can! It sells out fast and is an amazing night! 
Go to the Freshers Ball/Party. I have no idea what they're calling it this year.
Go to the Freshers Fair, get some free stuff.

First of all, you should be ashamed of yourself for forgetting the player that *could*  . . . *maybe* . ..  be even considered to gradually fit into the mould of a Makelele-esque players.

**RAMIRES**

Mikel - No, he doesn't dominate the opposing team with his technical passing, or his ability to break down attacks. He does put in a good shift, but he's usually passing and holding the midfield - gradually losing the ball when there's too much pressure. No where near Makelele.

MVG - Kids young. Real young. Overtime maybe . ..  **maybe** but to even say that he can *just* play the Makelele role is pretty ludicrous. 

Luiz - Still going for that, along with a few others. Luiz has demonstrated last season, his position belongs in the back. Yes he can play the midfield, yes he's storming down. But his marking is god damn awful, he's not suited for it. Yeah, he *could* become an awesome midfield player, but the games he's done for us in the back and really showed us what he can do. Why even think for a second, that he needs to be in the midfield.

&gt;For any readers from r/all, Nigel Farage is the leader of a far-right British party called the UK Independence Party.

Not far right at all.

&gt;They're anti-Europe, anti-immigration, and are generally considered to be pretty racist, with many of their members making publicly racist comments. They're also pretty hot on relaxing laws on hate speech and going back to ‘traditional’ British values, like chauvinism.

Anti Europe. They're not anti-Europe. They are against the UK being within the EU. Quite a big difference there. And what's wrong with that? Its a very popular political stance. Around 40% of the UK public also share that opinion.

Anti immigration. Not strictly true. They support reforming the system. And every country in the world tries to separate wheat from the chaff of people coming to their country.


&gt;Despite all this, they're doing pretty well in the polls, because Farage seems to many voters like ‘one of the lads’ — he's usually found in the pub, cracking jokes. Add that many voters are anti-Europe and anti-immigration, and you've got a lot people who are willing to look past the nastier and stupider (climate change denial) elements of the party.

Being one of the lads definitely helps, but when you look at all of our other politicians you can see why he has such big appeal.

&gt;Edit: Forgot homophobic. They're really homophobic, too.

Total lies. UKIP as a party aren't homophobic whatsoever. They believe government should have no role in marriage. 

They have had occasional party members saying stupid shit, but so does every political party. They are also small and growing rapidly, so lots of loonies attach themselves to the UKIP name. Once they are more established the mutters will be diminished.

Disagree with their political stances if you like. But don't deliberately spread misinformation. They're not ""anti Europe"". Their leader is married to a foreigner lol. They believe that the UK would be better off if we withdrew from the EU. Don't spread lies.

I'm really not sure what we'll do this weekend.  Suarez is the only other one who can really play this role and even his skillset isn't quite right for it.  He's just SO GOOD that he can make it work, albeit a bit differently from Coutinho's style.  I think we'll have to change the way we transition a bit to cope with it, maybe more emphasis on attacking down the flanks (which I think is also reasonable since Soton's defensive midfield is pretty scary to take on directly with Wanyama and Scheiderlin and IMO we have better attackers down the flanks than Soton has defenders).  This could place an awful bit of pressure on wisdom to push forward and he's not very good at it though.  It'll be interesting to see the kind of tactics BR sets us up with for this.

I feel like we're going to see Aspas in behind Sturridge again, and I'm not convinced that works when a player like Coutinho is not on the pitch with them.

Luckily Defoe is the master of those runs and got two good goals from it, although against a team that is struggling in the Norwegian league. Against a better defence it gets a lot harder. Naughton is conservative whether he's on the left or right, but against a team like Tromsø he should be comfortable in his preferred position when the whole opponent team is on their own half 80% of the time. 

Lamela seemed to expect Naughton to keep the width, and never adjusted his own game after seeing that he didn't. A lot of the game happened on the left side of the pitch as a result which just makes it easier for the opponent.

If you read their site, they explain it well:

I think what they say about same sex marriage colliding with freedom of religion is quite right. And if I recall correctly, a gay couple is already suing the church of england over this, only a month or so after the legislation was rushed through. UKIP predicted it perfectly. Personally, I think religious nuts are terrible, but they do still have freedom of religion and churches should not be forced to marry people they don't want to marry.

&gt;They seem to have a far, far greater proportion of members saying stupid shit on a routine basis

They ""seem to"", mostly based on the fact that UKIP are new, growing quickly, and suddenly attracting a load of media attention. Now the media (and other political parties doing opposition research), all the dirt is coming out of the woodwork at once.

Yesterday a tory MP told david attenbrough to take a one way trip to Switzerland. There are nutters everywhere, but UKIP have managed to go for quite a while without much scrutiny until now.

I don't think UKIP are really worse than any other political party. They're just suddenly undergoing a lot more scrutiny by opposition parties and by media who hate them.

I think Moses is favorite to have that spot right now, and if anything happened to Sturridge (god forbid) Suarez takes central and we Bring in someone else on the wing.

He also has a great shot on him aswell so he is a different type of goal threat that can change up our attacking threat if our current system is being defended very well in a particular match. He also had a pretty decent goal scoring record at his previous clubs. Another plus of Gylfi is that he has more experience in AVBs system than the other new players, so he can potentially add some direction and purpose in implemented tactics.

I would check Martin Lewis's MoneySavingExpert, he gives a great lowdown on everything.

Last year I went with Santander as they gave £50 free and a decent enough sized interest-free overdraft (£1500). This year their deal is way better, a four year railcard (but you don't have to be with them for the four years).

Best things to remember are:

1. Look for the best interest-free overdraft, it comes in very handy

2. Check what goodies they offer as an enticement

3. Don't use ATM location/branch distance as a criteria for choosing a bank

4. Make sure you can get internet banking, extremely handy when needing to pay bills/check balance from home

5. Loyalty gets you nowhere. Change the following year if a better bonus gift is available elsewhere. Banks don't value your long-term custom, they just like enticing new people in to have their money.


This year, I would say Santander looks like the best choice, but I already have a railcard and am already with them, so will look for the next best deal and maybe switch over.

true,roobens,lfc87,null,"Honestly, he has a pretty good point. But a better way of putting it would have been to point out how incredibly unrealistic a 4th place spot would have been that season. So if we rule that out, how many of us would have swapped a 5th, 6th or 7th place finish for our 2 finals and one piece of silverware? Despite the somewhat meh league performance that season, it was one of the most exciting seasons in recent years because of our cup prowess. 

Last season we were one position higher and were awful in cup competitions. Despite the good performances in the second half of the league campaign, it was a pretty dull season because from the moment we crashed out against Oldham in the FA cup (having already surrendered the league cup much earlier in the season), we were resigned to hoping against all the odds that we'd somehow get a sniff at 4th for a bit of excitement. As it was we didn't even manage to overhaul Everton.

There's a fairly large attraction it seems for people to underrate the domestic cup competitions, because of their lack of international prestige. But I can honestly say that I'd take an EL spot via a cup win, and all the resulting excitement and fanfare, than a 5th place spot in the league without any cup football. I feel that at this point in time our squad is still too thin both in terms of depth and overall quality to have both a top 4 spot and a cup run. Naturally we should gun for the CL spot, but if it looked like a steep proposition by Christmas, I think I'd prefer that we put out strong teams for the FA cup than continue plugging away for a 5th place spot which would only reap us the same reward, without any of the excitement or prestige of a cup success.",0,1379694840,null,0,false,0,ccc4o3a,t3_1mrfgb,t1_ccc4o3a,t3_1mrfgb,null,1429398930,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

&gt;1. We cannot keep waiting until scored on to get turnt up. The second they step on the pitch they should be going at it but our first halves have just looked like they're out for a leisurely walk.

2. Benteke **CANNOT** be our only scorer. Because if he is, he'll leave. If he is the only player to score a decent amount of goals for us, we *will* have a repeat of last season, and he *will* leave. Gabby and Weimann, especially Weimann, need to get their finishing back up to form

In addition to this, I think defensively, we need to tighten up and put more pressure on their key players, which I don't think we've done very well since Arsenal. 

Also as kind of an addendum to the first note, we need to speed up the tempo. Our passing and possession game is not nearly as robust as other teams, but when we play up tempo, it's near impossible for our attack to be stopped. If Players like Luna, Delph, and Gabby, act as the sparkplugs we know they can be, then we'll be pretty good.

Also, this doesn't apply to the next game but maybe signing another central defender on loan or emergency basis would be great, as we're really short there right now.

It's the job of the players and the manager to implement that and be prepared for matches. I agree that their team showed up and ours failed to, but I take it as an outlier. It is *probable* that we qualify from this group, but again the team must implement. Last year we beat Basel 2-1 and then 3-1. If we played this game 10 times, we would probably win 7 or 8 of them. Of course that has no bearing on what actually happens, but as fans we're not equipped to deal with that; only to talk about what *could* happen. 

I don't think I made myself clear regarding the supercup. Barcelona aren't a cornerstone for defining greatness, simply been the strongest and most consistent team for the past several seasons. Beating that team 7-0 over the course of two legs says a lot about Bayern's quality. So in terms of the performance against Bayern, I'd say we did very well. I do not mean to say that we should be satisfied with the result. However, I disagree that all the games should be counted equally. I would rather have any of a League Cup, FA Cup, Premier League, Champion's League, even the Club World Cup over the Supercup. It's better to have than to not have, but it's a 1 off game that has no bearing on what we achieve the rest of this season. It's based off of what was done last season.

Liberals are often anti-Christian, or otherwise disagree with moral or social principles held by many American Christians. They prefer atheism over the Christian faith, as atheism has no objective morality to hinder their big government plans. The liberal ideology has worsened over the years and degenerated into economically unsound views and intolerant ideology. Some liberals simply support, in knee-jerk fashion, the opposite of conservative principles without having any meaningful values of their own.

Rafa successfully made john terry second choice without hardly a sound from our fans.We aaccepted that his days as first choice were fading. Dave was being installed as first choice right back (a guy fit to llay the styke roman wants), luiz is clearly capable. We needed to buy a longterm replacement for jt who's built to play the high press. Terry is too slow. Period. We needed a partner for ramires in the pivot who's a deep lying playmaker type of a holding mid capabke of high pressing and excellent distribution. I like mikel as a destroyer, but he's not a great distributor. We must phase out the old guard and get in defenders and deep midfielders capable of pressing high up and linking play from the back to the front. Until we do...we are either going to watch our brilliant attackers be forced to play a defensive style...or our back line and pivots get exposed. Honestly, rafa did a pretty good job of finding balance. We needed to make the changes in the back 6 to allow us to play this attacking style roman wants. Willian was the worse buy in a ling time. Not because he's bad. He's probably going to be awesome. Bit we don't really need him do we. That money could have been spent in other areas...same with eto...loaning lukaku was insane. Moses too.

He does the thing [Neil DeGrasse Tyson frequently talks about](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xag3oOzvU68), where Dyer is effectively saying ""There are some flying objects in the sky.

Christ. Does he not understand what the word ""unidentified"" means? 

Later, he's talking to Patrick Moore, who makes the perfectly reasonable statement that there *may* be life elsewhere in the universe, somewhere, as it is such a vast region. And Dyer extrapolates from this that the life must be multicellular life, must be intelligent life, must be able to travel vast distances, and must have visited our galaxy of the billions in the universe, and our solar system out of the billions in our galaxy.

In general we expect the police to have a good working knowledge of criminal law rather than expertise. In this specific case, their actions were probably legally correct (based on the official statement) but their claims showed a poor understanding of the legal principle. 

It was quite likely that these guys were committing aggravated trespass. However, it's *possible* that the culling was illegal, or that they had permission. They need to verify these facts with the NFU. The law itself may be wrong but that's not a matter for the police in this instance.

There is a more general issue that the police will side with respectable organisations with an air of authority as opposed to a bunch of protesters. This should probably be addressed, especially when those involved in the superficially respectable organisation use excessive force.

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; If we've established that fetuses do not have a right to life and women have the right to choose, … 

But in this country we haven't established that - an abortion is only permitted on the grounds that the birth would cause the mother harm. 

This is interpreted with quite wide latitude by doctors, but it is something that's taken seriously - [there were police raids last year on clinics which were pre-signing consent forms.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/9161735/One-in-five-abortion-clinics-breaks-law.html)

It's one thing to say that a birth would cause a mother harm because she's not in a stable relationship and would have to raise the kid alone, or that she'd have to drop out of university, but it's a bit dubious to claim that a son would cause her harm because she's always dreamed of having a little girl.

Whilst I'm generally in favour of the mother's right to choose, the law in this country requires more than the mother's whim - instead it's long established as striking a balance.

I think that this week's writings on this subject are interesting and thought-provoking, but I don't think we should take them as any more than that. Apart from anything else, I think the authors have overlooked the potential for coercion (husbands demanding their wives carry a son) and the potential social consequences.

A very small gender imbalance may have disproportionate effects - how would you like to be the one who struggles on the dating scene because your mother made the same choice as everyone else when deciding your gender?

true,Letterbocks,eng-Cornwall,Onen hag oll,"The Brit influence in re-importing blues to a white yank audience is not a new revelation but there's no need to be a nationalistic prick about it Billy. 

This sort of divisive bluster is reminiscent of the mentality that allowed the Stones et al. to set ablaze the 60s billboard charts with incredible new sounds as the closed-minded US market was so apathetic, or antagonistic toward 'nigger music' that it took a bunch of British white boys singing it back at them before they could embrace it.

Perhaps, this is just a (myopic, at best) short article on music history that is meant to be enlightening rather than the vaguely full of some sort of 'it were our boys who dun it' rhetoric that I have taken it as. If that is the case then maybe my rant is misplaced, but there is still a couple of things which Billy overlooks, either through conscience of brevity, rose-tinted spectacles or obtuse patriotism...

F'rinstance, massive advances in audio recording, broadcast and printing technologies. F.Klatte did more to popularise the pop phenomenon than any artist by creating cheap records out of vinyl rather than exspensive, breakable shellac. Recordists like Joe Meek defined and understood the dark arts of compression that made pop sound like pop...The american affluence of the fifties propelled our early rock'n'rollers to stardom because the yanks could afford it (why do you think they fucked off over there!?)

I'm incredibly proud of how the early adopters of great blues in the UK became household names in the states, and there are deep-rooted reasons why brit music got big whilst black american musicians were stuck in their own communities and cultures until they were back-referenced by artists from across the Atlantic. 

Doesn't give us an excuse to have a pop at the yanks though. Which, I feel this article was full of.

Paulinho seems to be the best all-arounder, while Dembele is a slightly less skilled version of Paulinho. However, Dembele does have slightly more experience receiving the ball from the defense and advancing it upfield quickly given his extra year of experience. 

so really, we should expect a trial-and-error period when Etienne returns.

true,Girlwithnousername,,Proud 2nd member of STFC Official Fan Club. Go the oranges!,"Yes. He really can't remember. Other things:

- He also can't remember the name of the organisation we work for; I hear him stumbling trying to remember it for a good few second each time.

- Earlier in the week I observed him trying to deliver post to his team next door, when his team are opposite. He's been working with them for a month. 

- I encouraged him to go and see people rather than getting involved in lengthy email chains (rife at my place), so instead he phones colleagues in rooms next door rather than just going to see them, including his boss. 

- He asks me for grammatical help, listens, agrees, and then sends what he had drafted that seemed wrong to him.

- He asks for advice on how to reply to someone who's sent an email attaching a corrupted file rather than JUST FUCKING DOING IT. 

- On Mondays when I ask him how his weekend was, he can never remember what he did. 

- He stared at me in wide-eyed amazement today when I explained that Jack Nicholson's axe scene in the Shining and the 'here's Johnny' lines are some of the most iconic in film history. I get the feeling he'd never heard of the film. He is 31 years old. 

- He asks me for mentoring advice on a fairly constant basis and then asks me exactly the same questions a week later. 

- He lives in a flat where students (new sets each year) keep him awake all night and rather than talking to them or moving, he has put up with it for six years. 

- He writes his task list on a scrap of printer paper rather than using one of the few dozen pads we have in a drawer. Really - what?

However, yesterday I discovered he's earning 20k less than me, which makes it slightly better. 

He also asked me for advice on how to negotiate a pay rise with his boss today. I had to bite my tongue so hard not to say 'do you really think you're worth it?.' Instead I gave him a bit of advice and told him to bide his time. 

Basically he has shit all common sense and apparently no memory whatsoever. It's not a good combination. But because he's 'Mr Nice Guy' and very enthusiastic, his boss seems to think he's wonderful. Behind closed doors to me he's quietly bitching about the incompetence of 60 year old academics whilst simultaneously and hilariously being just as technically incompetent as they are. 

It's tiresome. I can train someone how to be good and I don't mind doing it for those with little experience, but I can't do that with no common sense and no memory. ",0,1379704415,null,0,false,0,ccc86zc,t3_1mribb,t1_ccc86zc,t1_ccc7nng,null,1429397274,1,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,1

The first time I was arrested i was 17. My friend and I had just turned up at Tesco to meet our friend who worked there and were followed into the car park by the police. They said that they had received reports of youngsters in the area causing trouble and proceeded to search us. I had an ounce of hash, a quarter of weed and some scales on me, so it looked a bit suspicious :/  I was arrested for posession with intent to supply and my friend was arrested for posession for the quarter of hash he had with him

I was booked in to the station and spent about 2 hrs in the cell while they waited on a solicitor. They fed me some microwave food and made me coffee and let me smoke in the cell. 

When it got to the interview they bought out the evidence in clear ziploc bags.  My ounce of hash had shrunk to 7 grams and my quarter of weed to 0.5g.  I thought this was very weird but didn't say anything. They tried to get me to incriminate myself as a supplier by telling me that my friend had told them that he buys from me. I knew this wasn't the case, and after a while I refused to answer anymoree questions and asked to speak to my solicitor in private. He agreed that it was best not to mention the missing cannabis and to not continue with answering their questions.

I was placed back in the cell for about 5 hrs, after which I was bailed for possession with intent. When I returned to answer the bail a month or so later I was told that charges were dropped to just possession and given a caution.

The act of two men having sex in itself is not a turn off. I'm sure there's some sort of deep-rooted biological reason for it. After all, men have been shagging one another since the beginning of time. 

What is a turn off is what goes on inside one's head. Now, theoretically as a woman, you could try to get turned on by gay porn, but the brain is always going to tell you 'I am never going to appear attractive to either of them,' and therefore it results in it not being sexy for you. There's probably an evolutionary purpose for it. No mating prospect = me no horny. I can't speak for the women you know who find it attractive. Perhaps their mating clocks are more broken than mine (which is no mean feat), or, more probably, they're able to close their minds more and ignore the thoughts in their heads.

Aside from that, near Oxford, towards the west, there are the cotswolds, a place of very picturesque British countryside beauty. One of the best places to go in the cotswolds would probably be Bourton on the Water. Easy to get to since you have a car. It's very beautiful and also rather romantic ;) *nudge nudge* with lots of friendly b&amp;bs around.

North of Oxford there's a little town called Bicester with an outlet mall called Bicester Village.

It's not really my thing - I'm not a fan of fancy brand clothing and accessories, but it is *extremely* popular with tourists, especially those from the middle and far East wanting to get big discounts on big names. Perhaps you already have things like that in the US so it may not interest you at all, but I thought you ought to at least know about it because many tourists come to the UK specifically for shopping there.

Ignoring the fact we aren't sitting on top of a tax haven banking centre or lots of oil, would you also want to be part of the EEC where Britain is governed by many of the regulations of the EU but without a voice at the table to negotiate it? 

What about things such as some of the European Courts being set up completely separate to the EU? The European Court of Human Rights certain tabloids like to lambast is run by the Council of Europe, completely separate to the EU with 47 European countries in it. Would you like to leave that too and become an international pariah? All so we can deport a few people easier?

I don't see what we gain from leaving the EU. It's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but reform from within seems a much more sensible option than taking our ball home. At the moment the EU and USA are negotiating the largest free trade area the world has ever seen... supposedly we're leaving the EU to get closer to America or the commonwealth; surely this would be something you want to be a part of? Or is this a case where we choose to take part through the EEC but have no stake at the table?

It's just not thought through. I'm sure if you asked 100 different UKIPers they'd have 100 different answers.

You'll also be driving near Warwick and Kenilworth Castles. You could probably do both on the same day if you really want. I've not been to either, but these are more likely to be more tourist-orientated and busier than Goodrich.

Your route between Glastonbury and Wales is a little bland. Wells, Cheddar and Axbridge are all nice places. Wells is one of the country's smallest cities (pop. 10,000) but has a large and very interesting cathedral. Cheddar is where the cheese comes from, and there you have the scenic Cheddar Gorge and showcaves. There are also showcaves at Wookey Hole -- not been in about 20 years, and I hear they're expensive, but might be worth a look. Axbridge is basically a small village, but there is an old building there called King John's Hunting Lodge which is now a museum and quite interesting to look round. You stop off at any of these and then get onto the M5 at the junction near Weston-super-Mare.

Not sure if you're planning to go to Glastonbury or not, but the Glastonbury Tor is worth climbing for the views over the Somerset Levels. The Abbey is also quite scenic too.

It's perhaps a bit out of the way, but [Bletchley Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bletchley_Park) (where the German enigma code was cracked in WW2) is worth a visit. It's about 50 miles north of London, but quite near your route up the M40.

Also, don't forget that much of your holiday is actually in Wales, not England. You won't have to pay to go eastbound over the Severn Bridge. [Caldicot Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caldicot_Castle) is also near the Severn Crossing.

**Driving** -- learn what a roundabout is and how they work, and don't be afraid to be cautious at first. ~~You should only overtake on the right side on the motorway~~; don't sit in the middle lane going slowly. Watch out for speed cameras, red light cameras, box junction cameras (do you have these in the US?), and average speed check zones on the motorway.

Nope, it wasn't Martha. She was played by the same actress that was later cast as Martha, but they're not the same character.

They threw in a line in Martha's first episode about how her ""cousin"" died at the Battle of Canary Wharf (the Cybermen/Dalek fight depicted in the S2 finale) to sort of explain it away.

&gt; How does she go to the other universe?

She didn't. She died.

&gt; What happened to that person?

She's dead. I assume she was buried or cremated, and Martha was sad and cried at her funeral, but was probably secretly happy that people would no longer confuse her for her strangely identical cousin anymore.

&gt; Is there any other mentioning of his brother other than this?

Not really, no. It's implied that he had a family that he abandoned on Gallifrey before the start of the classic series a few times - he at least has a son or daughter, as he's traveling with his granddaughter at the start of the very first season in 1963.",0,1379709923,null,0,false,0,ccca68w,t3_1mr8rt,t1_ccca68w,t3_1mr8rt,null,1429396350,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

so they're ONLY doing outreach to areas without significant minority populations? what non-racist reason do you think there is for that?

&gt; How do you know there is no minority representation whatsoever in UKIP?

I don't know there are no minorities voting for UKIP. I know not one single person from a minority has run and succeeded in winning a seat for UKIP. Like I said, if UKIP did not discriminate against minorities and there was no reason for people from those minorities to be opposed to their policies, there would be 21 people who weren't british or irish sitting in one of those 265 seats. There are 0, which is statistically impossible. What more do you want?

It's not a remotely absurd comparison, both the KKK and UKIP are racist organisations that claim(ed) to just want the best for their people. You won't find any KKK leaders calling the movement a hate group, because like UKIP they don't believe they are a hate group. Unsurprisingly, UKIP and the KKK alike have next to no minority members. I never said they were exactly the same, but they have the same pr tactics of claiming to only want positives, not negatives, while obviously favoring one group over others. Once again, explain why UKIP have 0 elected members who aren't white if you don't believe me.

&gt;Is UKIP's? Demonstrate so. 

There's a &lt;0.16% chance they aren't, what more can I say. You do not manage that kind of under-representation without having some seriously repugnant attitudes.

Can I get someone to trap and remove the foxes in my garden?



Yes: there are no legal restrictions on catching foxes in cage traps so long as these are checked at least once every 24 hours, although in the UK it is illegal to catch foxes in leghold (gin) traps. However, it is probably not worth the expense. Vacant territories are generally recolonized within a few days. Whilst most trapped foxes are shot, some operators have admitted to releasing foxes a few miles from where they were trapped. This is a very questionable activity, especially since foxes home over considerable distances. Exceptionally, foxes have been recorded homing up to 100 miles (150 kilometres), and trapped foxes are quite likely to return home if released within 30 miles (50 kilom ..... :(",0,1379710634,null,0,false,0,cccaf6p,t3_1mrt48,t1_cccaf6p,t1_ccca9vl,null,1429396234,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Uh, no - that their outreach is ineffective. They are based in rural areas. They did not have and still do not have a decent amount of representatives from ethnic minorities required to make those roads. They do not have the reputation amongst ethnic minorities to make those inroads just by being publicised by the media, are blighted with a number (small or large, notable either way) of contentious members who undermine their efforts with minorities by saying very stupid things and have are effected negatively by a public perception of closet racism.

However, this does not mean that the party is actually racist policy-wise.

&gt;Like I said, if UKIP did not discriminate against minorities and there was no reason for people from those minorities to be opposed to their policies, there would be 21 people who weren't british or irish sitting in one of those 265 seats.

Demonstrate that UKIP actively discriminates against ethnic minorities internally. 

&gt;There are 0, which is statistically impossible. What more do you want?

This is ridiculous. Do you expect to see every group or club in the country containing the *exact* demographics of their area? Would you call them racist if they slanted disproportionately to one race in some fashion?

&gt;It's not a remotely absurd comparison, both the KKK and UKIP are racist organisations that claim(ed) to just want the best for their people.

[citation needed]

I am still waiting for you to demonstrate a single policy argued by UKIP that is specifically racist. Until then your comparisons with the KKK are outright inflammatory at the very minimum.

&gt;You won't find any KKK leaders calling the movement a hate group, because like UKIP they don't believe they are a hate group.

See above.

I do not and have never determined categorising a group as a ""hate group"" on the basis of their own assertions - though this leads to a new question. Do you think hate groups should be banned on classification?

&gt;Unsurprisingly, UKIP and the KKK alike have next to no minority members. I never said they were exactly the same, but they have the same pr tactics of claiming to only want positives, not negatives, while obviously favoring one group over others.

They have almost no similar tactics at all. Go on any KKK website and you will find racist bullshit all over it.

&gt;Once again, explain why UKIP have 0 elected members who aren't white if you don't believe me.

I already have gave you my observations on that. Repeatedly. Why should I continue to repeat myself when you won't listen and instead look at demographic makeup devoid of context?

&gt;There's a &lt;0.16% chance they aren't, what more can I say. You do not manage that kind of under-representation without having some seriously repugnant attitudes.

Part of their problem is, as I have said that their indiscipline and attractiveness to right-wing racists has cost them credibility amongst ethnic minorities.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Uh, no - that their outreach is ineffective. They are based in rural areas

and like I said, even if every area was the *most homogenous area in the UK* the probability that there would be no non-white counsellors or MEPs is under 1 in 600. Even if every single place they ran elections was the most rural, least mixed place in the entire country they would not have 0 non-white representatives. It doesn't *matter* what the part say on pieces of paper, what *matters* is that out of the 265 people they have elected, zero aren't white. That shows that they are, without a shadow of a doubt, racists. They can tell the world they want to hug everyone who isn't pastey and kill the fucking boer, they're still in practice racist people.

&gt;Demonstrate that UKIP actively discriminates against ethnic minorities internally. 

they have 265 successfully elected candidates, who are an unbiased sample of the candidates they have put forwards for every election.

They have 0 successfully elected candidates who are not white, which is statistically improbable

Therefore, they must either be racist or enough people of colour are biased against them it's statistically likely that under 5% of them would consider joining UKIP (when 100% of whites would). There are two possibilities, either UKIP are racist or 95% of people in minorities are, you are welcome to suggest which you think is more likely and why, if you think the media is giving the impression the party is racist, minorities recieve special news that the rest of the UK population don't.

&gt;This is ridiculous. Do you expect to see every group or club in the country containing the exact demographics of their area?

Are you trying to give the impression to people reading this conversation that there is a difference between being at the exact top of the bell curve and being 2.5 standard deviations from it? do you understand what the statistics I'm talking about actually mean? do you realise what **1 in 600** means?

If you flipped a coin 9 times in a row and it turned up heads every time, would you say ""well I'd expect that to happen because you can't expect to get a random pattern""? 

&gt;I am still waiting for you to demonstrate a single policy argued by UKIP that is specifically racist. Until then your comparisons with the KKK are outright inflammatory at the very minimum.

right after you prove the KKK are a hate group and not a white rights advocacy organisation with a few members who hold their own opinions. Because you can't expect exactly 13% of the KKK to be black now, can you? it must just be a fluke, 1 in 600 isn't unusual at all is it.

You haven't explained yourself adequately. Not at all. You've implied you don't understand how improbable UKIP's makeup is, and you've implied that because you hold the opinion UKIP aren't racists, over 95% of minorities must be politically uninformed, but you haven't explained yourself.

There are other elements in play in this other than just mere statistics. People do not all act as a collective choosing to portion themselves out according to the demographics barring obvious racism preventing them from doing so. Certain groups, cultures etc are less interested in doing certain things than others for a variety of reasons, some justified some not.

Also I don't appreciate you isolating a single aspect of my explanation to just an extract where I pointed out UKIP's rural base. That is dishonest editing.

&gt;Even if every single place they ran elections was the most rural, least mixed place in the entire country they would not have 0 non-white representatives. It doesn't matter what the part say on pieces of paper, what matters is that out of the 265 people they have elected, zero aren't white.

So how do you propose that UKIP deal with it, precisely? I agree it is (or would be a problem for me if I was in charge of a party with that).

&gt;That shows that they are, without a shadow of a doubt, racists. They can tell the world they want to hug everyone who isn't pastey and kill the fucking boer, they're still in practice racist people.

No it doesn't. This is ridiculous. I have given you a list of reasons why UKIP is struggling to attract ethnic minorities.

In addition, do you know if any unsuccessful candidates and party members are an ethnic minority? You're focusing solely on elected representatives and ignoring the larger party candidates and activists and beyond that membership.

&gt;They have 0 successfully elected candidates who are not white, which is statistically improbable

&gt;Therefore, they must either be racist or enough people of colour are biased against them it's statistically likely that under 5% of them would consider joining UKIP (when 100% of whites would). There are two possibilities, either UKIP are racist or 95% of people in minorities are, you are welcome to suggest which you think is more likely and why, if you think the media is giving the impression the party is racist, minorities recieve special news that the rest of the UK population don't.

People of colour have issues with UKIP, I have never denied this and the party does attract many racists in base support which impacts negatively on its image to minorities. In addition, certain popular media outlets talk all the time about how they think UKIP is racist and highlight obscene and stupid comments from UKIP members when they occur to drive this home every time. If you don't think this has any net impact in how UKIP is perceived then you are deceiving yourself frankly.

&gt;Are you trying to give the impression to people reading this conversation that there is a difference between being at the exact top of the bell curve and being 2.5 standard deviations from it? do you understand what the statistics I'm talking about actually mean? do you realise what 1 in 600 means?

Yes, I do. Do you understand that there are reasons why ethnic minorities might be kept away from UKIP do not include the unjustified and unargued assumption that UKIP is a racist party.

&gt;If you flipped a coin 9 times in a row and it turned up heads every time, would you say ""well I'd expect that to happen because you can't expect to get a random pattern""? 

I'd expect any right-wing party in the UK to have a disproportionate amount of white people compared to the actual census.

&gt;right after you prove the KKK are a hate group and not a white rights advocacy organisation with a few members who hold their own opinions.

First of all, you have no concept of the burden of evidence. You shift the burden of proof (on an entirely different topic) to me when I request evidence of your assertions.

At any rate, I will provide:

The KKK as currently stands in the US is split into regional factions. Here are 2 regional faction websites I found just by googling:

[KKK Website #1](http://www.kkkk.net/ourbeliefs.html)
&gt;WE BELIEVE in an existing being known as the Devil or Satan and called the Serpent (Gen. 3:1;Rev. 12:9), who has a literal ""seed"" or posterity in the earth (Gen. 3:15) commonly called Jews today (Rev. 2:9; 3:9; Isa. 65:15). These children of Satan (John 8:44-47; Matt. 13:38; John 8:23) through Cain (I John 2:22, 4:3) who have throughout history always been a curse to true Israel, the Children of God, because of a natural enmity between the two races (Gen. 3:15), because they do the works of their father the Devil (John 8:38-44), and because they please not God, and are contrary to all men (I Thes. 2:14-15), though they often pose as ministers of righteousness (II Cor. 11:13-15). The ultimate end of this evil race whose hands bear the blood of our Savior (Matt. 27:25) and all the righteous slain upon the earth (Matt. 23:35), is Divine judgment (Matt. 13:38-42, 15:13; Zech. 14:21).

[KKK Websites #2](http://www.traditionalistamericanknights.com/Who_We_Are.html)
&gt;1) WE STAND FOR WHITE SUPREMACY. Distinction among the races is not accidental but designed. This is clearly brought out in the one book that tells authoritatively of the origin of the races. This distinction is not incidental, but is of the vastest import and indicates the wisdom of the divine mind. It is not temporary but is as abiding as the ages that have not yet ceased to roll. The supremacy of the White Race must be maintained, or be overwhelmed by the rising tide of color.

Most KKK advocates now fall under Stormfront which is an outright openly white supremacist website.

&gt;You've implied you don't understand how improbable UKIP's makeup is, and you've implied that because you hold the opinion UKIP aren't racists, over 95% of minorities must be politically uninformed, but you haven't explained yourself. 

I've given you explicit answers why I think UKIP has meagre representation in minorities. The sole point you have argued against is my mentioning of UKIP having a rural base. You have addressed nothing else whatsoever. You have also ignored my question on whether you think hate groups (as you define them, which seems to be solely by their group makeup) should be banned.

There are massive advantages to applying to a college like Trinity, and also downsides. Personally I think the upsides are worth it. The location, as you said, is a great help, but also the size means that all undergraduates are able to live on site (or at the very worst across queen's road) for all three (or four) years. This is extremely convenient, both in terms of location but also not having to bother looking for housing. On the downside, you're living in college accomodation, it's probably a little more expensive than flat-sharing, you might be required to move all your stuff out during the holidays (this is true for most first year students in trinity as they use the buildings for conference guests [well they say they do, in actuality they're rarely used]). You might not have great facilities, maybe 5% of the rooms in college have access to decent kitchen facilities, and showers/toilets might be shared especailly in the older courts, but on the upside you're living in picturesque listed buildings.

Similarly some people like the fact that trinity have bedmakers coming in every weekday, who change your sheets and empty your bins, some people find it a bit odd/creepy.

Again with it's size and money trinity offers a lot of other facilities, the sports grounds are really good, and they have competitive teams in most sports (the college gym is probably the best in cambridge) and the hall food is cheap and good. It offers also a lot of random funds that I'm not certain are as available everywhere else, for example there's some random fund that every undergraduate can apply for for a travel grant which is essentially £200 with no questions asked, or each year you can apply for money to do some activity ""to enable undergraduates to engage in life-enhancing activities which they could not otherwise afford"", and there are many more random funds for travel/study and exchange scholarships available if you spend the time applying.

There's a huge number of undergraduates, maybe 1000 or so at a time, which can seem daunting, but practically a large proportion of these are not especially social. There's a large (possibly larger than normal) number of overseas students at trinity, and a fair number of these can ""clique up"", similarly there's a skew towards mathematicians and scientists, which can mean a lot of quite weird people who don't really socialise. So whilst it's a lot larger than the smaller colleges, there's still a reasonably collegiate atmosphere, in that it's very possible to know a large proportion of the people who you'll pass in the courts/see in the bar or at formal (although obviously less so than somewhere smaller). Trinity also has a reputation, less so than Peterhouse or John's I'd say, for having a lot of upper class/posh people. It's difficult to say if that's the case, but cambridge as a whole has quite a rareified atmosphere at times, and trinity can especially. If, like me, you're from a less well off background, it can be a little odd (some might say intimidating), but for the most part everyone's very friendly here.

He's drawn attention from the conference by being willfully politically incorrect. The difference between sacking him for taking attention from the conference by being politically incorrect, and sacking him for being politically incorrect, is non existent.

There is however a big difference between a lack of media savvy and hitting a journalist when you don't like their questions. Hitting a journalist is pretty serious, particularly when done by a prominent member of a party which has been very quick to decry violence by those who disagree with it. I would have expected a strong statement condemning it, but instead we're getting 'it was just a tap'.

It's pretty insulting to think people will fall for that.

They're socially and economically liberal, in a pro-market sense (I'm never sure what liberal means economically anymore). One of their primary concerns is environment and climate. Their opinion pages tend to be diverse.

If you're looking for something a little shorter and cheaper, I cannot recommend a newspaper called ‘i’ enough. It is published by the Independent. Basically, it aims to be a short, easy read but with high quality journalism instead of trashy tabloid stories. Although it costs just 20p, and can be read thoroughly in half an hour, it has world news, opinion, business, sport, and puzzles (including an innovative ‘5 clue cryptic crossword’ if you're short on time). This is probably the newspaper I buy most frequently, for its price, high quality, and ease-of-read.

The BBC is pretty solid, most of the time.

The Daily Mail is to be avoided at all costs.

Nonetheless, the quality is very high, they don't sensationalise, and they tend to look at the facts and use reasoning from there rather than their own pre-conceived conclusions.

Having a reputation for good results means that they will put a lot of pressure on you to do well in exams, whereas some other colleges tend to have a much more relaxed approach. Depending on your school results, it may also be more difficult to get in to Trinity than other colleges.

The college itself is an amazing set of buildings, and really central in Cambridge. Depending on which subject you intend to study, it may not be the closest to your department, but will be great for shopping etc.

true,steefen7,null,null,"Our record is way better with Mata than without. Beyond that, though, Oscar is pretty much the only attacker we have that's one decent form right now. I'd say Chelsea's best moments so far have involved Oscar on the end of a through ball rather than creating one. Mata would consistently create opportunities. I don't think Hazard has as much chemistry with Oscar as he did last season with Mata. 

To your other points, Hazard will shoot with space and some of his best goals came from those types of opportunities (the Utd equalizer in the FA cup is a beautiful example). KDB also looks like he likes to shoot from distance.

With regards to KDB and Schurrle: I've liked what I've seen of KDB so far and wouldn't mind seeing out there more often, though I'm afraid he might be falling down the pecking order with Willian here. Schurrle does not go wide, he cuts in like Hazard but with a more goal-minded approach. I think with him we run the same risk that we run playing Hazard right now where we lose width and get shut down in front of the box.

Part of our greater problem is we seem to be crossing the ball into the box quite a bit, but haven't been very good in the air on that part of the pitch. Eto'o didn't win a single header against Basel and our aerial dueling success was only 33%. I agree that we need more width, but I don't think Schurrle is the one to do it. I think at the end of the day, Hazard needs to get wide because he is being marked so heavily this season. If he goes wide and pulls the RB and CB his way, that could open up some space to give the ball to Mata to redistribute before the defense recovers.

It's okay.  You can think of me being dumb if you wish.

Of course it's politically incorrect, he doesn't care about political correctness, but he didn't mean it in a misogynist way.  Her joke, his friend, was actually that the press had already tried to play it that way previously with another politically incorrect joke about fridges.  She brought it up and they laughed.  It's not feigned ignorance, he was calling her slovenly for not cleaning behind the fridge - the joke being that it was only ever said in the first place tongue in cheek.

&gt;He's drawn attention from the conference by being willfully politically incorrect. The difference between sacking him for taking attention from the conference by being politically incorrect, and sacking him for being politically incorrect, is non existent.

If he'd have said it at another time the consequences wouldn't have been the same.  

They even said when they announced he had been suspended that they would not be curtailed by political correctness.  

             ""I said that we would not be cowed by political 
              correctness and nor will we, and I want people 
              to push the boundaries of debate, but we have 
              to do it in a manner which is seen  to be civilised,
              and if people step over that line then frankly we
              have no option.""

The joke was politically incorrect, his behaviour after it and how he dealt with it crossed the line.

&gt;There is however a big difference between a lack of media savvy and hitting a journalist when you don't like their questions. Hitting a journalist is pretty serious, particularly when done by a prominent member of a party which has been very quick to decry violence by those who disagree with it. I would have expected a strong statement condemning it, but instead we're getting 'it was just a tap'.

&gt;It's pretty insulting to think people will fall for that.

See, I think you're deliberately sensitive.  It's unacceptable.  It's a terrible PR decision by him but slapping somebody on top of the head with a magazine and equating it to an attack on journalists, I'm sorry but it's exactly what Crick did with the terrible question he asked.  

All 3 of you are just as bad; Crick, Bloom and you.

I think it's the other way around.  I think people are getting fed up with tiptoeing around on PC eggshells and they're seeing a dumbification, even a US style way of campaigning, creeping in and they don't like it.  I think people are starting to see through the media's sensationalism more and the sterility and homogeneity it creates in the unitary LibLabCon party.

&gt;Sure there is a hardcore who enjoy Bloom. But perhaps tonight they will be wondering how long before they get turfed out for being politically incorrect.

Again, in the statement that announced he was being suspended, 

                ""I said that we would not be cowed by political
                         correctness and nor will we.""

See, you're actually falling into the media's own trap.  They make a big thing about something, and it nearly always means they miss the actual policy or statement or don't take it on board.  It affects your appreciation of the situation.  You've got to cut through the hype and not join in with it, otherwise you lose perspective.

If anything this is going to propel the media's role in this and the political correctness debate to the fore again, like it did in May, and as Farage also said, the policy we have announced will be there long after the chip paper of tomorrow (technically I suppose that should be tomorrow's tomorrow if they still used newspaper).

true,kingofeggsandwiches,null,null,"I would say the simplest answer is that southern working class accents more closely resemble RP in comparison to working class accents spoken in other parts of the country. Especially so when you take into account the perspective of working class people further from the south-east. 

What you have to understand is that London is without question the most affluent part of the UK, and it's there that you're likely to come into contact with the greatest number of RP speakers. That said, RP is not merely spoken in the south, a large share of public/independent school educated kids will pick up a RP accent even if their parents don't speak that way (or at least their own modern and regional variation of RP if you get into the fine details). Whilst the RP spoken in Lancashire is different from that spoken in London, they still resemble each other far more than either resemble the working class accents of each region. There is a great (but quite snobbish) quote from the old days along the lines of ""it is the duty of the affluent classes to speak in such a manner as that nobody can tell whereabouts in the country their schooling has taken place"" 

So as RP is spoken everywhere in the UK by at least some of the demographic that would be labeled as upper class or upper middle class, it is therefore universally associated with being ""posh"" all over the country. However, RP as an accent was based on the accents of affluent people living in the the gentrified areas of the home counties and the midlands. Before the advent of radio it's most likely that even the aristocrats of the north had spoken in refined but nonetheless regional dialects that sadly no longer exist. 

So with RP being based off the generically southern sounds of affluent people, southern working class accents still resemble RP more greatly than working class accents in those places further from areas of historical affluence, such as the south west or far north. These westerly/northerly accents are more shifted from the original source of RP and thus even further away linguistically. So, due to the universal nature of RP, when someone from these areas further from the south-east listens to another's voice to determine whether they are posh, they'll be looking for the same speech markers as someone from the south would be in the same situation, however when they listen to hear the accents they associate with the working class they are listening for the types of speech marker that someone who's mostly lived in the south simply wouldn't ever say. Cockneys for example are very fond of the long -a, as in dance or can't, and modern RP uses this too, but it would never be spoken by someone who wasn't ""posh"" in Yorkshire, simply because it would be such an anomaly, and really anyone who uses the long -a in the north generally would be marked as ""posh"", or worse ""pretentious"", unless they were obviously from the south anyway in which case they'd be marked as a non-local.

So in conclusion this is why many people outside the south-east thinks southerners sound posh (or at least posher), because neutral and even working class southern accents contain none of the speech markers that people who live elsewhere are looking for when trying to identify a working class accent, while simultaneously containing more of the markers that people from elsewhere (and everywhere in the UK) would associate with ""posh"" accents. Also you have to remember that most people don't have a interest in any of this, so they're not thinking hard about this technical linguistic stuff at all, but just saying what their subconscious is telling them about how a person sounds.

Two things I don't think being taken into consideration is mata has been injured and as a result is not match fit and is not playing well as of late at all. And also I believe matas defensive work rate is near non existent, while Oscar is very good both on offensive and defensive side of the ball take the juve game last year as an example. I just feel that people think playing Mata over Oscar will be this magic switch that will make the goals pour in when in fact I don't think that would be the case. Oscar has been playing very well at the moment I believe he deserves to play the 10, while Mata has looked not so good in his opportunities. Don't get me wrong I think Mata is top notch player but I don't think he deserves the 10 over Oscar at the moment. 

That's what I'm saying about hazard when he does take advantage of the space and plays more directly he is at his best. I only wish he would play that way more. 

In regards to Shurrle the only reason I suggested him was because I feel in the next game hazard needs to see the bench.

I'm not one of the people that thinks we need to cross more, we are very small in the attacking section of the field and don't show any signs of being successful in the air. I think the key to our success will be getting wide to create space for quicker passes/shots from 10-20 yds out.

We can discuss the factors that lead to this uniformity (or we can get it out of the way now: the gentle massaging of broadcast media), but that is the ultimate cause of your complaint: us. Our ingenious model of democracy allows us to vote in status-quo candidates where we know exactly what to expect, hold them prissily at arm's length while they do our dirty work, and then  complain while we bring in identical replacements in the next round.

I'm broadly on-side with you on this whole topic, but you cannot act as if the electorate are lost little sheep being deceived by the nasty wolves. ""DM-reading sheep"" know the deal. By and large, they're comfortable people; if they were interested in corruption, incompetence, military interventionism, security encroachment, it's all there out in the open on Wikipedia and in the history books - yet somehow they keep voting! Because they know exactly as much as they care to know, and no more.

So there's our culpability, and I don't think we should wriggle out of it. You seem to be perfectly aware of the much bigger role of the media, the political class and our inherited social/power structures in all this, so I'll just stick to the the element that you've overlooked (and spare you about seven paragraphs of collected drunk thoughts).


As an aside, I forget who, but a sci-fi author once wrote a short story about a beautiful, idyllic city on a distant world. On the night they become adults, every citizen is taken to a locked room in a hidden building and shown a young girl who's kept imprisoned and in constant pain. They're told that this is the price of their utopia: they can keep the secret of the girl, leave the dungeon and go about their idyllic lives, or they can free the girl, which will destroy the city and the lives of everyone they know. 

And of course this is an old tradition, and the city is still standing, and they know that everyone before them has been given this choice. 

Just a thought. I like to bear that in mind when I find myself getting angry at Daily Mail readers.

true,CencusT,scot-Lothian,Lothian,"Back in 1990 I was squatting in London, begging in Picadilli tube station was caught in one of the sweeps they used to have on a regular basis whenever some visiting dignitary was in the area. I'd been around there for a while so most of the police knew my face &amp; that was friendly &amp; polite. (you get more money begging if you smile and say thank you).

Anyway it was local plain clothes that arrested me. They were a bit apologetic about nicking me. Then they spotted I had my pet rat with me, so they are like ""ok we'll do a deal with you, normally we'd have to send the rat up to the RSPCA shelter at Wembly but if when the desk seargent asks you to empty your pockets you take the rat out last we'll bail you"". So I marched up to Vine street nick escorted by two coppers. Get in there and there's a load of folks I knew all waiting to get processed, after about 1/2 hour or so it's my turn. Name, date of birth etc. ""Right empty your pockets"". Baccy, skins, lighter, a few gig flyers about 20 quid in change, rat. At the this the desk sergeant looks up, screams, and runs out the room full pelt. The whole station is looking in doubled up in laughter. It was out the station ten minutes after that. Went to court the next day got a 3 month conditional discharge.

Not too long after this I was at bank station spotted a couple of uniform so stopped what I was doing. ""are you begging"" ""no"" name check ""ok empty your pockets"" I had about 25-30 quid on me ""We'll just take this for the police benevolent fund shall we?"" ""fuck off it's mine I need it"" ""ok get the hell out of our area, London Bridge is that way"" ""I have a travel card is ok to get back on the tube?"" I pull out a child's travel card ""what age are you?"" ""14"" I say with a smile. ""Just fuck off"" 

I've been nicked a fair few times never given the police any lip only had one bad experience. I had an unpaid fine so when two police came to the door I wasn't very surprised except that they were plain clothes. They say word to the effect of you have an unpaid fine you are coming with us. Get down to the car there's another two. I'm like ""wow four of you what I am meant to have done?"". No reply to this. Get to the station, booked in, sit in a cell for a couple of hours. Then I'm pulled into an interview room with two CID, I'm beginning to get worried. Then I get hit with that I've gone out on a Sunday night to a go-go bar, joined up with some geezer who was flashing a lot of cash about then walked in the opposite direction, mugged the geezer, then walked into a bank the next day and cash a £900 quid cheque.I explain that I've never been to a go-go bar in my life, would never be in a pub on a Sunday because I'm always skint by then, would never try &amp; mg anyone because they'd kick the shit out of me, but they are not having it. They say they have a witness putting me in the bank at the time in question. I say I want to speak with a lawyer. One of the CID says that they don't have to get me a lawyer as I'm here for an unpaid fine. By this time I am absolutely shitting it thinking I'm getting fitted up for time. I'm nearly in tears (I'm only 17 at this time) I keep asking for a lawyer and eventually they get bored and put me back in the cells. I'm in a few political groups at this time and it turns out over the period of a month everyone who'd ever put their name to anything related to one group was arrested for something they didn't do and finger printed and photographed then released.

Tourist activities are not all that expensive and you won't have people bothering you in the street trying to sell you crap. If you come at the right time, you can visit many colleges for free. The university parks and port meadow are completely free to roam, and if you want to visit blenheim palace gardens nearby, but don't want to pay the entry fee, I can tell you a secret back door way in ;) but you do have to pay if you want to see inside the palace buildings themselves. Go to the right place for punting and you'll have a nicer time too with less people crowding the river. 

All in all, Oxford is definitely worth a visit and it is not a tourist tap at all, especially if you already know where to go. And many people right here on reddit including me can help you with that! 

Edit: I should also mention that the students in Oxford are very much used to tourists all over the place and will mostly be friendly and helpful if you approach them. British people are not the type to openly offer help without prompting but if you aren't afraid to ask, they will happily oblige. I've occasionally been stopped by tourists asking for a photo with me dressed in my formal gown after exams and I was happy to grin for a couple of snaps!

Richard Mitchell, Daniel Dorling and Mary Shaw (2000)
Inequalities in life and death: What if Britain were more equal?

""Annually, some 7,500 deaths amongst people younger than 65 could be prevented if inequalities in wealth narrowed to their 1983 levels.""

""Some 2,500 deaths per year amongst those aged less than 65 would be prevented were full employment to be achieved. Two-thirds of these would be in areas which currently have higher than average levels of mortality, preventing 17% of the 'excess' deaths in these areas.""

Department of Health (2002)
Tackling Health Inequalities: Summary of the 2002 Cross-Cutting Review

In Manchester, boys can expect to live almost eight years fewer, and girls almost seven years fewer than their contemporaries in Kensington, Chelsea and Westminster.

Life expectancy for males in social class V is over 7 years less than for professional social classes: 71.1 years compared with 78.5 years. For women the gap is over 5.5 years.

Andrew Sloggett and Heather Joshi (1994)
Higher mortality in deprived areas: community or personal disadvantage?
British Medical Journal 309 (1994): 1470-1474.

Higher death rates in deprived areas are not related to the area itself. Deprived individuals have a higher risk of death, wherever they live. Some areas have higher death rates, because more deprived individuals live there.
In England in the 1980's, unemployed males aged 16-70 had 1,24 times the death risk of employed males from the top three socio-economic groups.

Farage claims they would not be cowed by political correctness, but how believable is that to those who have just seen a major figure in the party sacked?

As for the journalist hitting, I don't think I am being particularly sensitive. I just think it's rather hypocritical of Ukip to cry about violence when faced with rowdy students, but when a major figure hits a journalist basically shrug. Asking a bad question does not equate to hitting someone, nor justify it.

I agree people are probably fed up with pc etc, but I think you are wrong if you think today will be seen as about pc, it will be about an arrogant idiot hitting a journalist in the face with a magazine. I doubt this will give people confidence to vote for his party? My theory is that Ukip have peaked with that kind of crowd. That was what today's conference was about after all, moving on from the eccentric small party to a serious political force.

I suspect you're too deeply invested in the party to accept that, and that's why you think I have fallen into a media trap. You forget, most people aren't in as deep as you. This may 'propel the media's role in this and the political correctness debate to the fore again' but that is a debate that will be going on amongst the faithful, it won't be heard anywhere else.

So anyway, I just think today was a lose/lose for Ukip. They lost the opportunity to show their serious side and attract serious voters because Bloom was a buffoon. And they may even have made some of the old gang unhappy as they see Ukip move on from their non-pc roots to aspire to the sterility of the main parties.

I appreciate that it's difficult, but for asylum seeking ideally there should be a procedure where we determine their need.

During the time we are assessing them, they should probably be held in some sort of holding area, or have restrictions places on them. However I'm not an expert in this area about what happens, how many really go AWOL, how many end up staying or going and everything else.

But really I would separate immigration and asylum seeking as two completely different issues. I'm sure that most British people would be happy to help people fleeing persecution.

It's also what the gay couple in question said would happen.  Their reasoning is that the Church of England is effectively a part of the government - it is completely fucking disgraceful that they insist on discriminating against LGBT people and women, while happily accepting all the privileges their established status affords them (such as the large number of seats in our legislature).  Apparently their local vicar (who would be conducting their wedding if he was allowed to) is on their side.

true,Exlives,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"Last summer 3 friends and I had a bit too much to drink, and we were walking up a country road when one of my friends thought it'd be a great idea to kick through one of the windows of a phonebox, (bit of a destructive idiot really). Someone witnessed it and called the police, and they found us walking up this country road, arrested us and took us back to the police station. 

We all slept in different cells, and had to wait to the morning to be interviewed. (Don't get arrested, the sleeping conditions are awful). I was 17 and didn't have to call my parents in for the interview, (I told them about it after), and my 2 friends who were 16 had their mums come down to the station. During my interview the police wanted to know who had kicked in the phonebox, (the evidence was stacked against us). The police officers were really kind and only wanted what was best for us, basically trying to find out who did it, so they could give them a caution/little mark on their record, and let everyone else get away scot-free. I ended up telling them who it was, and it was revealed to me that the other 2 fessed up too. 

The police ended up releasing us about half an hour later, the friend who did the crime got a mark on their record (which was wiped when they turned 18), and the other guy and I got nothing. The police were totally understanding that it was a drunk stupid thing to do, and just told us to keep control and if we do drink, stay in our houses.

Later that year a person I knew got caught drunk driving, apparently got treated terribly by the police, and since he was 17 he didn't contact his parents the whole time. A week later he committed suicide, (I don't know the full details), but I believe that experience had really messed him up and caused him to do it. (There may have been other reasons, but from what I've heard from closer friends of his, that played a role in it). 

His parents ended up campaigning to get the law changed, to require 17 year olds to have an parent/guardian contacted when the person got arrested.

He's got Hazard to back track more than attack too, so even if Jose is talking about a ""new style"" of play, it certainly doesn't seem like anything new from him.

Oscar does not have the same vision in attack like Mata  or any other number 10. His game revolves more around making runs than being the playmaker, which is why our attacks have been so terrible through the middle. Mata on the other hand can do so much more.

He was shit vs Everton because it was his first game of the season without a proper pre-season, so of course he's going to be shit.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"&gt;Well at least you're not still arguing that Bloom was using some archaic term from his childhood. 

Err, yes, I am.  

Are you having difficulty in reading?  It makes no sense in any other context.  He comes from a generation were it meant something different; slovenly.  His friend who he introduced into politics jokes about not cleaning behind the fridge so he calls her a slut i.e. **[slovenly, a synonym for slut](http://imgur.com/wPm7ViJ)**.  He could have said 'messy mare' and that wouldn't have been p.c. either.  

To argue that he meant to imply she was promiscuous or an easy lay because she joked she doesn't clean behind the fridge, and that's why people laughed, is verging on the Aspergic.  That's probably not p.c. either.

&gt;In the end, dissecting the joke is irrelevant

It's not if you still can't get your head around it.  Have you even listened to the audio file yet?  It doesn't sound like you have.

&gt;As for the journalist hitting, I don't think I am being particularly sensitive.

I'm not saying I think you are particularly sensitive.

I think you are deliberately feigning sensitivity.

&gt;The top ranks seem to think that they need to be more serious and sober, that's why Bloom has gone, and despite Farage's words it certainly looks like non pc behaviour will get you sacked. 

See, I think you're being deliberately obtuse on this point too, to the point you're arguing that what Farage said and what he meant were polar opposites.  He said twice today that they must not be cowed by political correctness, and you're arguing from now on they will allow themselves to be cowed by political correctness.

It's actually a campaign point that they must not be scared of addressing the non-pc, and that the UK is in a mess because the media and certain parties painted discussion of immigration as being non-pc and racist.

Where I said you must stop engaging in the spin, cut through it.  This is it.  You're buying into a load of media spin, not understanding the situation or actually allowing it to divert you from being informed, and coming up with exact opposite conclusions.  All the while ignoring the actual explanation for why he was suspended.  It wasn't the joke, which could have been easily explained had he just gone into the banter before it and who with.  It's the way he reacted.  He could have taken all the heat out of it straight away - hell, he could have even brought JC in.  Instead he threw gasoline over it.

&gt;So anyway, I just think today was a lose/lose for Ukip. 

I think the policy announcements and speakers were awesome.  Norwegian style sovereign wealth fund,  10% corporation tax, the Congdon review, lowering African tariffs.  The role of the media and pc and all the controversy.   I really think the backlash is going to be the other way now that BBC and R4 are playing the actual audio file.

Absolutely terrible day for Godfrey Bloom even though his speech on defence went well.  He should have bit his lip, sat on his hands, and stayed in the conference hall and away from the fringe meetings.  The Crick issue wasn't even to do with the joke.

&gt;And they may even have made some of the old gang unhappy as they see Ukip move on from their non-pc roots to aspire to the sterility of the main parties.

HA, jog on.  I think your theory might require a bit more reading.

You just simultaneously claimed that they were now becoming sterile as the other 3 and turning people off for not being as sterile as the other 3.  

Meanwhile in the papers we have Ed Miliband highlighting for his connection in sleaze emails and the Conservatives facing imminent leadership threat after only last week Barroso telling him to be pro-Federalist when his own conference is next week with Adam Afriyie calling for a referendum before the GE.  UKIPs attending their fringe  too - and I've seen the readership of ConservativHome's reaction to this 'scandal', and the Telegraph, Mail, Express - and I know the large consensus is that Conservative readership bases are seeing it more my way than yours.

I'm kinda enjoying the cross party controversy.  Everybody is going to be calling everybody out - only UKIP has publicly put its house in order.  Can anyone in the LibLabCon say that?  Is anyone even talking about the Lib Dem conference that ended this week?

Looking forward to tomorrow.

&gt;I suspect you're too deeply invested in the party to accept that, and that's why you think I have fallen into a media trap. You forget, most people aren't in as deep as you.

That's a nice way of spinning informed.  Remember, you're only making these mistakes because you're not cutting through the spin on ALL sides.  Deeply invested?

true,llamas_theory,null,null,"I'll have a go at mine, but this is gonna take a while to remember properly. what follows is about 20 mins of bashing my head against a wall trying to recall the smaller details.

First Crush: A girl in primary school called Etha. I spent a lot of time with her during recess, I had had guy friends too but for a while it was nothing but her. I was rather infatuated. Sadly I moved around a lot as a young child so I inevitably moved away, joined a different school, and made all new friends all over again.

First kiss: At the age of 15, to a girl called Callie. Her older sister and older sister's boyfriend had treated us to the cinema, to both facilitate Callie's infatuation with Superman in Superman Returns, and to allow me to take on her on a date for a change. I would have had to save a month of pocket money to take her on the simplest of dates back then. After the film, which she smiled from cheek to cheek all the way through (I would know because I couldn't take my eyes off of her), she took me to the side and kissed me, then I was dropped off back at home.

I had to get on myspace and ask her how it was as I was so panicked I had not kissed properly, it being my first time and all. My mind was racing with all sorts of worst case scenarios, but she assured me she couldn't tell that it had been my first kiss. Truth or not, it certainly calmed me down.

And yes, before then I had never kissed anyone on the lips.

The relationship would later be broken off by me, in a foolish mess of anxiousness and self-doubt. I then went quite nuts with myself over what I had done, and quickly and horribly drove her away in my desperate cries for help. It was the turning point that led me to the lowest point in my life, as I found myself homeless and penniless, with barely an education and not a clue how to progress in life.

Don't worry though. Years later, things got much better, and I'm doing well for myself now.

Then you are being obtuse. The joke rests on the double meaning of slut. I am not arguing that he implied she *was* a slut.

&gt;I think you are deliberately feigning sensitivity.

Nope. I don't see any circumstance where hitting a journalist when you don't like his questions is something to be played down. Doing so make Ukip hypocrites.

&gt;to the point you're arguing that what Farage said and what he meant were polar opposites

He's a politician, it's not unusual behaviour for them. You keep claiming I am buying the media spin, when you're spinning like a top yourself. The fact is Bloom has gone, Farage is angry that the serious side of the party is overshadowed by a buffoon, this on top of the recent accusations of his totalitarian control of the party. His words say one thing, the actions of the party another.

&gt;You just simultaneously claimed that they were now becoming sterile as the other 3 and turning people off for not being as sterile as the other 3

Yes. Ukip are supposedly 'growing up'. This is a deliberate effort on their part. Some members of the party don't like this, they don't want to grow up. Bloom is a prime example. So they see this 'growing up' as becoming sterile, while people outside see the buffonery and conclude they are still a joke party. 

Anyway, at this point I am going to leave it. It's late, I have to get up tomorrow, and I doubt you are going to concede an inch in your views. Your post history shows you are an extremely strong Ukip supporter, and a very well informed one. You've written thousands of word in their support on reddit. It isn't surprising that you are engaging in damage control today. But I think you are too close to the party to be able to correctly gauge the opinions of those outside it. I certainly don't represent the views of everyone outside it, but I doubt my opinion is that uncommon.

All we need to do is have a rule that parents are not told the sex of the baby until such a time as it's too late to abort.

It's not *reverse* eugenics - aborting your kid because you don't like its gender is *actual* eugenics, isn't it?

Nobody is told before their kid is born that its ginger, so your analogy doesn't hold.

It's not a ""massive invasion"" by the government to protect your rights, and I think our children have a right not to be fucked with this way.

Kaboul or Dawson --&gt; Chiriches

We ran the hell out of Verts on Thursday, I think, so he should get a break. But we really need to get ahead from the start in this game. They'll probably park the bus too, so we need all of our bus-busters out there from the start.

&gt;Then you are being obtuse. The joke rests on the double meaning of slut. I am not arguing that he implied she was a slut.

Do you realise you keep copying my exact vernacular?  I actually take that as a compliment.

Anyway...

Front page newspapers carrying the story today?  One.  The Independent.  Even they aren't trying to make the link that you are:

              There was a laugh. Good old Godfrey, this is the 
               party of free speech, and he was using the archaic
               meaning of “slut” as a bit messy, obviously.

Even they aren't going to try and make the argument you're trying to imply.  It's silly.

&gt;Nope. I don't see any circumstance where hitting a journalist when you don't like his questions is something to be played down. Doing so make Ukip hypocrites.

That's where the real hypocrisy is.


You make it sound like he gave him a concussion.  He slapped him lightly on the top of the head with a programme and then threw it at his feet, for insinuating that putting photos of UKIPs activists and councillors on the front was racist because they weren't dark enough!

&gt;You keep claiming I am buying the media spin, when you're spinning like a top yourself.

Rather, if you were paying attention I'm quick to criticise him myself.  I just do it accurately, and with personal purpose.  I'm also perfectly ruthless.  Has he drawn attention from the conference and could it be a benefit to the cause if the party comes out strong?  I believe so, and as such gladly throw him on the sacrificial altar before the ceremonial burning, and use the same fire generated to burn the likes of Crick's 'hack' journalism, as even the Independent called it in their article, and those that wish to fuel such hack journalism.

The good thing about not worrying about political correctness and being ruthless, it frees you to be being brutally honest, truthful and direct.

&gt;Some members of the party don't like this, they don't want to grow up. Bloom is a prime example. So they see this 'growing up' as becoming sterile, while people outside see the buffonery and conclude they are still a joke party.

See, you're just making shit up now.   

You're now arguing that supporters of the party don't want more attention on the conference and for the party to become stronger after delivering some great new platforms.

&gt; It's late, I have to get up tomorrow, and I doubt you are going to concede an inch in your views.

It's not late.  It's early.  And I'd gladly concede a whole country mile if you actually made a point, as it is I suspect you don't even believe half of what you've written, or at best know you're exaggerating to try and make a point.

&gt;It isn't surprising that you are engaging in damage control today. 

You're not paying attention.

I'm criticising Bloom.  I'm using him.  Out of all this controversy I'm seeing the media and political correctness come more under attack from several key readerships.  I'll take the notoriety now because Coulson himself doesn't want it, and the DM article you link to also argues that they'll still cause their earthquake in May.

What I am looking at is the readerships of the publications, and the UKIP article in the DM with comments - all the top rated comments (and the DM actually regularly attacks the party) are coming out in either favour of Bloom or saying enough is enough against the hacks the p.c.

And the trend is being repeated.

&gt;After all, it seems the Daily Mail[1] has a similar view to mine on today's performance.

Again, look at all the top comments: DM, Telegraph, Express,  Conservative Home, Spectator.  I'm looking at the grass roots.  You're swallowing a media spin.

Sure it works for a few at the very top of their particular game/sector, but the most commonly effective strategy is 'real' capitalism - i.e. stopping being a wage slave and leveraging.  Of course, in order to do this you have to be prepared to shit on others.

As an example, if you set up a small business and run it as a standard small businessperson, as a mom and pop shop, work very hard, become the face/s of your business and work all the hours god sends; when you come to sell the business, you might make a bit over the value of your stock, your contracts, your property, etc. for your good name, but you won't make bank, and you certainly won't get rich.  However, if you go back to the beginning, and set up a proper [business system](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/strategy/enduring_ideas_the_business_system), ensuring the place has a brand and a flavour and a niche, but is essentially anonymous, with readily replaceable staff and detailed work flows, chopped into small bits that even a lab rat can manage, and then you let it multiply like a virus as a chain, now you've got something to sell which may make you rich.

Having said that, of course the Internet has been a game changer as far as high street chains are concerned, and big corporations are increasingly dominating all sectors of the market, so it's not as easy as it once was unless you find a new/emerging market, or a new niche in an old one (and the transnationals may be slow, sclerotic and cautious, but they won't be far behind).

true,Dirkinator,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"My earliest memory of ever watching Dr Who was Tom Baker in [The Ark in Space](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xsfh7l_the-ark-in-space-part1_shortfilms). Looking back it's easy to dismiss the early years as cheesy or corny, but try to see it from my perspective at six or seven years old.

My day, after school, was watching cartoons. I had based my entire life, up until that point, on sesame street, play school, and then later cartoons like Bananaman, Dangermouse, or Roger Ramjet. One day my mum decides she's had enough of my nagging and allowed me to watch Dr Who with my older brother...

It scared the shit out of me. Slowly, as the episodes went on, I became more terrified. I went from cartoons and happy little kids shows to the mother fucking Doctor! Here's a show with (to my childs mind) crazy special effects, a Tardis that morphs in and out of time, and the freakiest hero wearing a long scarf. People died! And monsters were real! People talked about sci-fi things I could barely comprehend and for them it was everyday life. People say it was corny and is now dated, but at the time it was the most serious thing I had ever seen. 

I can't explain it. It shook me out of my happy little world and showed me that there are horrors in the world. These episodes from ark in space... there was a man who gets encased in some kind of goo who turns into an insect monster... I don't know how I could possibly have imagined that at six years old. I'm gonna say my little mind was blown.

So yeah it scared me... and I loved it! Over the next few years Mum watched me freaking out and told me I should stop watching if didn't like it, but I did! It's like the thrill of a roller-coaster, you love dreading it and it makes you feel alive! Also, it spun me out a few years ago to realise that Sarah Jane was the first companion I ever knew in these episodes when she came back to the show recently

Got to the bus stop, and had missed the bus.

Waiting around while one of my mates used a public phone to call his Mum for a lift, and a police car rolls up.

4 police get out, and grab us.  We are bundled into the back of a van, and told we are under arrest for destruction of public property.

Obviously we have no idea what is going on, but are taken to the station, regardless.

The police show us CCTV of us running toward the bin.  The CCTV cuts to another angle, then about 20 seconds later cuts back to the bin.  The bin is now completely smashed out of the floor, and laying on its side with the contents all over the street!

After AGES of us protesting our innocence (all individually, as we were split up) the police get hold of CCTV showing another angle, which shows another group of lads coming in the other direction who boot the bin over, but were obviously not apprehended!

They let us go with a mumbled apology.

Policeman who arrested me was great, nice and relaxed; he was young and new I think.

The guys at the station (which was Melksham police station, [scene of this lovely bit of policing](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wiltshire-11190561)) were fine on the evening.  I was the least of their worries.

In the morning they were pretty rude to me.  In my eyes (and in reality), I had been arrested for self-defence (under which I was acquitted of all charges with CCTV evidence when they ludicrously tried to take me to court) against an entirely unprovoked attack; in theirs, I was an idiot scrapper guilty by default because I'd been arrested.  The pervading attitude was aggressive and discomforting.  

I learned they were to charge me later, which was a shock considering no one had been seriously hurt and I was emphatically not at fault. The nightclub we'd been outside had had problems with fights in recent years and the police were itching for excuses to close it down.  I was being made an example out of, and well, tough shit if having a criminal record would screw up my future career.

I think they thought I'd roll over and plead guilty.  With legal aid, I got a better solicitor, who advised me to plead not guilty and advised the magistrates to throw out the case as it should never have come to court.  They did.

Automatic assumption of guilt at the station, charged and brought before magistrates on woefully misguided charges, waste of everyone's time when all charges were dropped.

Really? How about they discuss the various nuances of UKIP policy. Or maybe discuss the actual content of his speech. No that would require effort. It's easy to stand their with a camera phone and prod away until you get a reaction.

My suitcase was 15.02 kg when I flew out with my mum earlier in the year, and the lady at the desk still let us put my mums make up in there, bringing it to 15.08. I flew alone with a toddler a couple of weeks ago and the flight staff were quite helpful, lifting my bag into the overheads for me and helping said toddler get up the stairs while I carried the bag. 

Saying that though, we recently attempted a mass trip with 9 of us going to visit our parents. The M25 came to a complete standstill and 8 of us were stuck on it with all of our boarding passes. The ninth had got the train up from her uni town, and when it became apparent we weren't going to make the flight we told her to get on it anyway. They asked for 70 quid to print out her boarding pass, then sent her to the wrong place to do it. When she eventually found the right desk, they told her it was now within 40 minutes of take off and they wouldn't be able to print out her boarding pass at all, she'd have to miss the flight. 

We all got on a different flight for later that day on the promise that our Ryanair travel insurance would reimburse us for the missed flight earlier.

A 4-2-3-1 is typically a fairly narrow system anyway, and I genuinely don't think we have the quality overall to make that work possession-wise against most teams in the premier league. A 4-3-3 system usually forces opposition to drop at least one of their midfielders a bit deeper, or keep their fullbacks back. This -- in theory at least -- should mean we don't get overrun as easily in the middle, which is our main problem at the moment, imo.

The last time we played a 4-2-3-1 with any kind of success, we had a solid ""2"" of Petrov &amp; Milner to allow Downing/Young/Albrighton to pull wider. We can't really do that with Delph and Westwood in the middle... yet. Especially not if we're going to use converted strikers in those wide attacking midfield roles. They both have a tendency to move away from the touchline before attempting to cross, I've noticed.

I'd say that if we want serious wing play, combined with better possession play... it may be worth revisiting the 3-5-2 system Lambo used a few times last season. Since our fullbacks are attacking in nature anyway, it's not much of a stretch. Luna especially has shown he's a threat attacking from deep...

But realistically, we don't need to change the formation or approach. Especially not for an away game. Just need to be more focused and tighter at the back. A speed-based counterattacking system works just fine for away games. As I've mentioned before, we had reasonable success with it under Martin O'Neill.

I've chosen Kolarov at LB due to Clichy probably not starting. I'd love Clichy to play but I think we don't need to risk him when we've got a half-decent LB who can be covered by Milner playing down the left. I think we need Milner's work-rate in this match so that'll be a good combination. Zabaleta over Richards purely for his combination with Navas, and we will benefit from Navas's pace against Evra, and his crosses will terrorise Utd.

In midfield I think Fernandino will hold a lot more and give Yaya some freedom. You can't man-mark Yaya in a big game, he'll shrug you off regardless if you're a tall guy with an afro or a little Asian guy who sits on the bench. Silva will operate in the hole (hopefully, as I don't think Nasri will be as effective in that same role against Utd) and make loads of space for Aguero, Yaya and Milner.

Finally, Aguero over Dzeko as his movement compliments Silva and Navas hugely.

I think people are against unfairness and its a horrible situation we've got into where there isn't enough housing to go around. I think people want a fairer sharing out of the social housing available. I've got a friend in London for example who works, earns £30k, but can only afford a houseshare. So he has to share the bedroom with his daughter when she comes to stay.

Meanwhile there are people who could take that houseshare, but instead prefer the council home they have. I have another friend, who has a disability, and has a two bedroom semi to herself. Me and my girlfriend work in the same location and can only sensibly afford an apartment. 

She has not worked a day in her life. She didn't get that house because she needs two bedrooms: she accumulated a lot of points, and so could easily outbid other people (e.g. with kids) when that council house became available.

Obviously she claims loudly and frequently about the bedroom tax. I do care about her and think she should have support and help. But I think she is under the illusion that life is easy for everyone else other than her. Where actually she has been given so, so much more help than anyone else, and now they are just giving her less help than they were previously..

I want the ideal world where we actually build social housing that can meet the needs of the demographics, but until then we are facing an extreme shortage of housing and frankly the available social housing stock is very inefficiently utilised. Consider that in many places now houses are being converted so that every lounge and dining room is a bedroom too to try to provide enough beds.",0,1379757651,null,0,false,0,cccky55,t3_1mskr5,t1_cccky55,t1_cccbvk3,null,1429391313,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

&gt;A musician wakes from a terrible nightmare. In his dream he finds himself in a society where
music education has been made mandatory. “We are helping our students become more
competitive in an increasingly sound-filled world.”  

&gt; Educators, school systems, and the state are
put in charge of this vital project. Studies are commissioned, committees are formed, and 
decisions are made— all without the advice or participation of a single working musician or
composer.
Since musicians are known to set down their ideas in the form of sheet music, these curious
black dots and lines must constitute the “language of music.” 

&gt;It is imperative that students
become fluent in this language if they are to attain any degree of musical competence; indeed, it
would be ludicrous to expect a child to sing a song or play an instrument without having a
thorough grounding in music notation and theory.

true,Vaneshi,cnty-england,Midlander trapped in Hampshite,"&gt; I think eventually it will be required that job seekers must complete a certain number of applications per week, all tracked through their crappy system. Job seekers who don't have a PC at home will be told to attend local libraries and job clubs, or places like A4E and Ingeus to complete their quota.

Would it not be cheaper to give every unemployed person a free laptop and low end internet connection?  Lemme grab a napkin and some coffee. 

I mean one job centre goon is on about what? £17k depending on if they're at the JCP, although I've seen 'benefits advisor' positions advertised for what is know locally as the 'tax office' which were much higher and had final salary pensions (you bet I applied for that bad boy, so did half of Hampshire I'd bet). 

A cheap Dell laptop is what? £399 or so and the cheapest BT Broadband is £15? (I'm on Virgin so dunno) and you get them to sign an agreement that if they break or sell it a replacement is garnished from their JSA.  They touch an official portal and feed it what they've applied for or apply via it (it'll take both inputs).  Bosh.  Done.  If your machine has to be sent off for repair you could either throw em a loaner or even simpler... a dispensation, you don't have to job hunt for 2 weeks whilst we get this back to you.   

So roughly every JCP employee ditched could fund 32 such set ups and there are at least 30 employees at my local JCP more if you include managers and back office staff.  Lets say there are 30, we keep 1.  The IT guy to help fix job seekers machines; he sits there waiting for the job seeker to come to him (or her) not doing onsite calls; cushy or what?  

That's 931.9 such set-ups we haven't even factored in using refurbs, super massive bulk purchase discounts (you are buying like 5 million of them at once, it could even be a special trimmed down one so cheaper still) or skipping the people who do have computers and internet at home already.  Nor have we figured out the savings in office space and that attendant cost and we've done it all using what I think are gross underestimates of how much some of these people are paid per year to boot.


Having met more than one DWP employee who'd sanction you for smiling (or what felt like it) and hearing a gaggle of them talk about ENJOYING sanctioning the scroungers.  Fuck em and their unions, cheaper to give everyone broadband and a PC.  We'd also jump instantly to first place in connectivity per head of population I think as well :)

Ok, Ok I'm on the wind there but....

What you are really on about here is taste. Fucksake I HAD to study musique concrete and tape music. Your attitude is nothing new. I once went to see 100 metronomes tick (Ligeti - also did the dissonant choral music used in 2001). Was any of that music? yes of course it was. Did I enjoy it? no, not all but some stuff I thought initially had no merit I really did enjoy on repeat listening. 

The point I am making here is that you are not really debating what is and is not music because you cannot make that judgement for all. What you can say is what does and does not have merit to you. That car horn is music, as is the ambulance siren. So is birdsong. So is the train clickety clacking on the track and the rain on a window (many songs inspired by all those things). If you are not moved by birdsong it's not for you. If you don't hear rhythm when you are on a train speeding down a track perhaps it's not for you. 

Like graffiti and art, what gives you *satisfaction* (now there's another debate worth at least a few pints and some crisps) may not be what does it for the next person. It does not make the subject matter any less ""art"".

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Windows makes up the vast majority of the OS market.

A fact that will become even more stubborn if children are mandated into learning that OS.

Is it even possible to ""best use"" Windows? The OS is limited in so many ways - whereas open-source alternatives are not only free but far more capable. Windows has always been designed for the low-level user - which negates any need for ""training"".

Finally do you really want to reward Microsoft executives rubbing their hands in glee at the idea their business is secured forever without having to compete?

Linux does have some great uses in the real world:

* you can install it free on your home computer, you don't need to purchase or illegally download an expensive version of Microsoft Windows
* Linux does everything - with one exception - it still lags in supplying gaming software - but nearly everyone interested in gaming has an XBox or PlayStation for this purpose
* Linux does *more* than Windows - it can be a server, it can be a desktop, it can have *more than two users logged in simultaneously* - basically Linux can do anything *any* OS can do

If you want kids to have a basic trade-level skill for word processing then, fine, offer an option to do a 3-day Windows course. But if you want to educate children in computing and give them a real advantage in this technical world then equip them with knowledge and tools that will allow them to flex their intellectual and technical muscles.

I think we're in danger of ""dumbing down"" the subject too much. Mathematics isn't exactly super-simple at high school. Subjects such as integration, statistics, algebra, are all basically analogues to programming.

Would a serious computing unit be pitched at a level that I, as a 14-year old beginning to learn C in my own spare time, would find embarassingly stupid? Or would it aim to give children a better understanding than most adults whose claim to technical achievement is an Excel spreadsheet?

Note that companies are moving away from Windows, too. Look at organisations using Google Documents to replace Word Documents (though I still feel Google Docs is not ready for the enterprise market, personally). This is because so many people choose to use a range of computers - including Windows, Macs, and Ubuntu, as a personal choice. The ability of the online cloud to provide enterprise services is almost negating the need to learn about any particular operating system at all.

So why Linux? Well actually I don't mind - FreeBSD, OpenSolaris, even ReactOS (an open-source Windows clone). But whatever it is make sure it is *free* without need for licencing.

I think we're talking about different things here, I'm talking about low-level maintenance of Windows, the day to day tasks that keep the OS relatively stable. I feel there's not enough people who know how to run even the most basic of anti-spyware and AV scans. I suppose that's a point in favour of Linux right now actually, it's pretty bulletproof when it comes to that.

&gt;Finally do you really want to reward Microsoft executives rubbing their hands in glee at the idea their business is secured forever without having to compete?

Take it up with the MSDNAA, which has its claws in a serious chunk of FE schools around the country. My college mandated the use of Office (pre-2007, thankfully) and Visual Studio (there's worse IDE's on the market) with no appetite to use open source products.

&gt;Would a serious computing unit be pitched at a level that I, as a 14-year old beginning to learn C in my own spare time, would find embarassingly stupid? Or would it aim to give children a better understanding than most adults whose claim to technical achievement is an Excel spreadsheet?

Herein lies the heart of the problem with education. If the course is too easy, you don't teach anything of worth to the students. If the course is too hard too early, students will think ""well, what's the point of even trying"" and say fuck it to the course. I don't know where the happy medium is on education, if I did I'd probably be running the show.

&gt;Note that companies are moving away from Windows, too. 

Not at a fast enough rate sadly, XP is still a common office OS. Maybe in 10 years if we all get high-speed broadband and access to cloud storage, at that point all we'll probably need is a terminal.

&gt;So why Linux?

Ubuntu is almost identical to Windows at the low level these days, it's the ideal OS to wean people off of Windows and into Linux.

In the same way as 20 years ago the NHS was not efficiently run, social housing is not efficiently distributed.

Personally I would not do it through a bedroom tax mechanism, but by having every person who is eligible for housing benefit receive a fixed amount regardless of where they live, perhaps with a small additional amount per child.

Firstly, just to clarify I wouldn't assert myself as being right wing or anything close. I also don't believe that the majority of the Eastern European come here to claim benefits, my original post was a little strong.

My source of information is basically where I live. I'm surrounded by houses that are rented out to large groups of Eastern Europeans, and they spend the vast majority of their day in the garden, drinking beer. I have spoken to most of them and they all openly admit they are here to claim benefits. To make matters worse one group of individuals took great pleasure in trying to destroy my house for the best part of the year, breaking two window panes and smashing my fence throwing each other through it.

I have also worked with Eastern Europeans, and quite frankly haven't seen much truth in them working harder than UK residents, but employers favor them because they assume they work harder. In one job I worked at we were published statistic's on how good we were. Every week I was coming out top. When the busy period was over, I got sacked and 3 Polish women were hired. I think this was down to most employers thinking all men under 25 are going to go out, get drunk, and phone in sick every other week.

true,evilcleverdog,wales-pembrokeshire,Pembrokeshire,"&gt;I was being a little sarcastic with a grain of truth.

&gt; It is amazing how all the money goes on tax, nursery fees, childcare and other things. Then the wife decides to stay at home and spend some of it. Then your mum wants you to pay for her gardener because she is too old to do it.

&gt; Before you know it that's gone too.

If you think your money is gone too fast, that's simply because you're too accustomed to having a luxurious life style. You are far, far removed from the common man. What sort of person, who complains about not having enough, sees it logical to hire a gardener? Do it yourself or let the weeds grow. Most people don't have the money to  pay someone to tend to their grass. To me you just sound plain indulgent. I mean why do you have childcare and nursery fees when your wife is staying at home? What is she doing?

Your comment is so odd. You're a rich person but you don't even realize it. If a hard financial decision is thinking about getting a Mercedes, then you are doing reallly, really well for yourself, don't you think?

true,Vaneshi,cnty-england,Midlander trapped in Hampshite,"&gt; At a scholastic level we're not training anyone to work on oil rigs or to be good housewives - those are choices left to the individual at a later date.

Good housewife... not so much.  But there do seem to be a lot of people wandering around who don't know how too cook, not too busy to cook but simply can't even cook themselves a bacon buttie.  Same with putting a spare wheel on a car. 

I mean 'EnglishNumptie' is quite clearly trolling for whatever reason... come on Numptie does mean Idiot after all but he does inadvertently make a good point or two, the first being the lack of cooking skills in the general populace.

The second is his 'girls are different to boys' shtick.  It's actually true, several studies indicate that boys and girls learn differently; different speeds, different focuses.  What makes a girl interested in a subject may well (and often does) bore a boy of similar age to tears.  There are few studies, of perhaps dubious nature, which indicate a tendency for teachers to treat boys, acting like boys in effect as misbehaving girls.   So perhaps a period of segregation where both sexes are taught how to learn (which is a skill and must generally be taught) before reintegrating back in to one class at a certain age might actually be the best for both.

It's something that needs more looking in to IMHO. 

&gt;  when kids play together without any preconceptions of gender differences.

Bullshit.  Google 'Primary Transsexual', it's an old term and I'm sure there is a more PC version these days.  It's basically a small child with gender issues (that boy is a girl or vice versa).  Yes, kids are quite aware there is a difference between boys and girls even if they don't necessarily know what the differences are or have the language skills to convey it.

Most years there will be a large group of medics who only really hang out with each other, and similarly with mathematicians, I haven't really noticed it as much with other subjects, but it could be true. For the most part the things that seem to matter most are year group and college, not subject.

true,RobertTheSpruce,null,null,"As far as I am aware, they want a national standard, along with regulated testing, for all relevant staff, with clear and defined methods of dealing with people who fail the tests.

The current system is where every brigade can decide all of those things. They decide the method of assessment, the pass level, the rehabilitation method, etc. etc. etc.

The current recommended pass level is 42 on the VO2 Max scale thing (You'll have to excuse my simplistic terms here, as I'm no expert on VO2 Max). 42 was decided because it apparently is the required level to complete the most difficult job that a firefighter will have to do, which is apparently fight a fire inside a compartment (having done every job a firefighter has to do, I disagree somewhat, but that is by the by).

Some brigades make that the pass level. Some brigades do no tbother with fitness testing. Some brigades make up a different number. Some brigades, argued and said 35 is the magic number. Some brigades will merely take you off the run (this means 'made unavailable') for not achieving 42. Some brigades will take you off the run for not achieving 35. Some brigades will only take you off the run for wearing breathing apparatus. Some brigades do not care if you do not pass, some brigades will discipline you if you fail. Some brigades contract staff to spend one hour per day in a gym. Some brigades do not require you to go to the gym. Some brigades allow staff 15 minutes per week in the gym. 

My brigade for example, If I was to take the test tomorrow the pass rate is 42 AND 35. If you fall below 35, you are made unavailable for fire calls. You are deemed no fit for duty and put on a rehabilitation program, with a reassessment in a months time. If you fall between 35 and 42, you FAIL, but because they have deemed 35 to be the minimum score, and put on a rehabilitation rogram with a reassessment in 6 months, in the mean time you are able to keep working, and if you get above 42, you are able to carry on as normal.

It's a huge clusterfuck, and NEEDS a national standard. The union quite rightly believes that if some brigades need to save some money, and get rid of some staff, they will merely play around with the pass rates and sack some people easily and quickly, making those unlucky firefighters lose a job and a massive chunk of their pension.

And with all of that, the VO2 max pass levels currently do not move even with age, or gender. [This website] (http://www.topendsports.com/testing/norms/vo2max.htm) gives a few VO2 max norms. It shows that for a female to achieve 42, she must be above average, and once past the age of 45, needs to be Paula Radcliffe. For men, it is of course easier to meet those targets, but again, once you hit your 50's you are going to struggle.

In answer to your question: no, but I would think she supports the idea. Here's why:

* In Portsmouth, [the Department for Transport reported](http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/speed-limits-portsmouth/speed-limits-portsmouth.pdf) that since the introduction of 20mph limits ""the number of recorded road casualties has fallen by 22%""
* A [report conducted by LSHTM for Transport for London](http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/20-mph-zones-and-road-safety-in-london.pdf) found ""a 42% reduction (95% CI 36%,
48%) in all casualties within 20 mph zones""
* In [Oxford too](http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/10634130.20mph_limit_makes_roads_safer/), there have been ""a sharp drop in the number of accidents since 20mph zones were brought in""

Additionally, there is no evidence that the oft-cited negative consequences are as bad as they're made out to be. [Bristol council found](http://www.bristol.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/transport_and_streets/managing_roads_and_traffic_schemes/20mphMonitoringReport6_3_12.pdf):

* ""The impact on journey time is very small, whilst the improvement for other road users can be significant."" 
* ""an increase in walking and cycling counts especially at weekends""
* ""maintenance of bus journey times and reliability""

So, 20mph limits a not just a loony Green idea only being tried in Brighton. From the [20's Plenty website](http://www.20splentyforus.org.uk/its_time_for_20.htm):

&gt; With Manchester joining many of the UK’s other iconic cities (e.g. Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Bristol, Lancaster, York, Brighton and many London Boroughs) **there are now 12m people living where a 20mph limit is agreed for most lit streets**. With the DfT encouraging 20mph limits for residential streets it’s significant that repeater 20mph signs are a major cost of implementation.

There's so much ignorance on this issue and it drives (excuse the pun) nuts. It's a no brainer, which is probably why the [public supported it](http://present.brighton-hove.gov.uk/Published/C00000695/M00004099/AI00031701/$20130111120008_003244_0012873_ReportTemplateCommittee.doc.pdf) during the consultation and why no councillors (of any political colour) opposed the plans at [Transport Committee \(in January 2013\)](http://present.brighton-hove.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=695&amp;MId=4099&amp;Ver=4).",0,1379767961,null,0,false,0,cccm21p,t3_1mtwzf,t1_cccm21p,t1_ccclqwk,null,1429390794,5,false,brighton,t5_2qprp,5

Hughton made the right subs at the right times in my mind. Redmond was poor once again even if he should be playing on the right, but is he better than Snodgrass down the right? 

The wrong player took the penalty. The less said about that the better.

The ref had a very poor game, but he wasn't the reason we couldn't score against a team who haven't kept a clean sheet since January.

All this talk about Fox is silly. He has a good range of passing, but Howson is far more effective in all areas of the game. I think that Fer and Howson struggled to play any kind of killer ball through to RVW. To be honest, we didn't have and kind on final ball all game. 

Their goal was a bit sloppy, and they really didn't really look very dangerous for the most part.

Shame really, UKip is just another party and this highlights how much defending of its self a smaller growing party has to do. If any of us started our own party because we thought we're fucked by house prices, are a generation of renters, poorer due to inflation, this shows how larger partys will just dump money into smear campaigns and in effect 'buy the voters away'.

If brown had failed to act he would become the British equivalent of Hoover, the unpopular move of bailing out the banks would have been nothing compared to allowing Britain to sink into an actual economic depression. 8% unemployment is shit enough, how would you feel if we had 25 or 30% unemployment?

Brown was a politician and was obviously a liar like all of them but at least he acted to prevent complete meltdown.

The relationship between politicians, banks and the property market is unfortunately something that is far far bigger than any individual politician. Nobody dares aim for sustainable, sensible growth because it would piss off a large section of the middle class who provide most of the swing votes.

Likewise, I haven't really read up on much of what the greens are about, apart from the environment and so increasing energy/petrol prices?

**1.** A CLEAN SHEET! Some good defending today after the bad news of Okore's long lay off. Was actually quite surprised by how well Bacuna played.

**2.** Guzan was great. Well deserved MOTM and pulled off some great saves once again.

**3.** Good goal from Kozak, good to see him get his first goal and looked dangerous at other times.

**4.** This was a game we really had to win after the Newcastle lost last week (which I was quite upset we got nothing from). These type of games we need to be winning in order to avoid a relegation fight again this season.

***Negatives***

**1.** Benteke injured (hip flexor apparently, how serious is that? He looked in a lot of pain and was pictured with crutches). When Agbonlahor came off I feel we lost a lot of our attacking prowess.

**2.** Was not convinced by Tonev. Willing to shoot, but I think one of them was one target and straight at the keeper from about 35yds. The rest ended up being skyed.

I'm sure the injury has varying levels of severity as with any injury, but I think if you can take something from the Ray Rice situation, Benteke may only need a week or two recovery (Which will of course suck for the spurs cup game on tuesday)

&gt;By Tim Walker

&gt;Although not quite up there with the boy band One Direction, Stephen Fry is nevertheless one of the nation’s most popular individuals on the Twitter social networking website, with more than six million “followers”.

&gt;It has always been taken for granted that the actor, writer and “wit” writes all his own musings about life himself, but I spied him at The Wolseley restaurant in St James’s on Thursday, deep in conversation with Andy Serkis, the actor, who starred as Gollum in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy.

&gt;I can’t be absolutely sure, but it appeared that Fry was emitting “tweets” as he spoke to Serkis. When I raise the question with Fry’s spokesman, he tells Mandrake, carefully: “Stephen composes all his tweets himself, with the exception of the charitable tweets that he posts on other people’s behalf.

&gt;“We ask organisations to construct the tweet, and make sure that the website address they include is robust enough to handle the traffic his tweet will attract.”
Fry has in the past “retired” from tweeting, only to come back again with a vengeance. If it is the case that the 56-year-old actor does decide to ease himself off the social networking site, then I, for one, would be delighted.

&gt;At innumerable parties, I have seen him not conversing with fellow guests, but huddled in a corner, hunched over his iPhone.

Super optimistic comment!

Huge lack of creativity in attack, losing possesion all over the place in the midfield and a huge defensive error that led to a goal.

Suarez **will** sort out our attack. He gives everything we're missing. Creativity, Elusiveness and he tears defenses apart.

When Coutinho is back, we'll be able to put Hendo back in Midfield where, in my opinion, he does his best work. Should give more passing option so we don't lose possesion like we've been doing.

Our defence need time to get together, they need to be better at knowing what each other are going to do.

Enrique was awful, but he always seems to need time to get into the game and subbing him on so late didn't give him enough time.

I'm still holding out hope for Aspas, I live with a guy from Madrid and he told me about how great Aspas was last year. He's done SFA so far, he really needs to beef up because he's just too weak. He's seriously testing me though. 

Sterling hasn't impressed me for nearly a year now. I think he's way too confident, he's really not as good as he thinks he is. He can get there but he's just not even close at the moment.

Southampton are one of the best pressers in the league, it is Pochettino's biggest tactic since he was taught by Bielsa.

Center backs are naturally more lethargic in possession, so having the entire back 4 incapable of playing their way out under pressure was stupid. This meant that Lucas and Gerrard were going to so easily harassed by Schneiderlin and Wanyama every time they received the ball. Those two are excellent defensively and far more powerful and athletic than our midfield.

Aspas was non existent first half. Second half, Sterling gave us width but Southampton were pressing so well that we couldn't get Hendo into the game. We ended up playing long balls where we could not compete in the air. Our midfield and defence are not good enough when pressed for us to dominate against such competent opposition.

No, I think you'll find by default Windows 7 can play back more formats than a stock Ubuntu can.  

To do the 'crushing' you must select the non-free packages, agree to their attendant licenses (which may or may not bar you using them in an educational or business based capacity kinda of important considering the topic at hand) and click through at least one big fat ""THIS IS NOT FREE SOFTWARE, WE DO NOT SUPPORT IT.  YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN!"" style message. 

Sorry but it really gets my goat when people take their heavily customised and tweaked install, happily forget that it's a customised and tweaked install and compare its capabilities to an absolute fresh install of a version of Windows. 

If you really want to see stock Windows gets its head kicked in for media playback, look no further than Apple.  Every Mac with a DVD drive will actually play DVD movies, as Apple pay for the license.  Microsoft don't, so stock Windows can't.

But it is worrying that he thought today's starting line-up would offer a credible attacking force.

Mourinho isn't just any other manager, he was successful with Chelsea and cultivated our initial style and mentality that lived on for almost a decade.

Anyone that actually follows the club understands our need for a long-term manager, yet there's already bitching and moaning about Mata being more important than Mourinho. Anyone who thinks like that is a cancer, since this disposable manager mentality is Chelsea's problem. Sure, we've won trophies, but we have zero consistency or identity, almost failing to qualify for Champions League two years in a row.

De Bruyne deserves a chance and has arguably done more than Schurrle when played.

What the hell Eto'o? Showed nothing the last two games. Times to give Torres a go. He may not be great but he lets the midfield blossom and is used to his role.

I'm not even going to comment on the fact that Mata hasn't made the bench.

Reckon one of Rami, Iva and Cole could do with a rest. Fulham at home? Perfect time to loosen Azpi and/or Bertrand back into the action.

Not a fan of the JT + Cahill partnership. Both offer similar defensive attributes. Hope to be proved wrong though.

Not impressed with the selection.

Sakho was quite good going forward in the first half, certainly not worse than Enrique in the past games. Enrique apparently carried an injury hence his limited playtime --&gt; Sakho at LB makes sense. 

Kolo was also decent at right back, had one or two very good forward runs. He is no Johnson but certainly I felt a lot calmer with him at RB than with Wisdom. So, again, this was not something dramatic.

And then what? Usual midfield pivot of Gerrard and Lucas. Henderson in front of them, Aspas on the right, Moses on the left and Sturridge up front. This is exactly how the majority of people on here wanted us to play in midfield and attack so no complaints there.

Gerrard and Lucas had an underwhelming game and this is why we failed to create enough chances and ultimately lost. 
I would say that, because of Sakho and Kolo being fullbacks, we mainly came through the middle, but that's not entirely the case and Sakho and Toure enjoyed a decent game. Rewatch the game and concentrate on them and see for yourself how Lucas and Gerrard were hiding in midfield and our defence had to play the ball between them without forward option. Pathetic. 

I don't think Rodgers got it wrong, he simply has no other option. Johnson is injured, Enrique is carrying a minor/larger/whateveritis injury, Coutinho is out, Suarez was still banned.

Thank you!  This is the point I've been trying to hammer home, if Linux can't run the standard business apps that a given business uses without incident then a business isn't going to give it the time of day.  You can't had wave away the need for 1:1 compatibility with the prior formats they were using (Word, Excel, etc) up to and including documents with half a done of VBscript business logic macro's buried in them.  Nor can you simply tell a business to junk their existing internal web apps that demand Internet Explorer (or more likely ActiveX), that stuff usually costs a bomb to upgrade let alone outright replace with a version that'll run on a non-Trident engined browser. 

I mean it's almost like these people have never tried to get CUPS printing to a USB printer.  In my experience and using everything from Gentoo to Ubuntu if it works you were really god damn lucky, the internet is littered with people pulling their hair out trying to get that to work.  Sometimes you need to override CUPS's USB module in favour of the Kernels, sometimes vice versa, occasionally you need to blacklist both and use something else instead. 

As a server, running server grade stuff and mid-range corporate grade stuff (printers, etc.) it's excellent, it works today, it worked yesterday... it'll work tomorrow.  Just what a business needs for the most part. Feed CUPS a nice half way decent network laser to manage and yep, off it goes.  Excellent.  But small businesses like to cut corners so you're more likely to find them using cheap as chips hardware all over the place.   I remember one fairly profitable small business that was at the time using Windows ME and Compaq Pressario's. 

And big businesses are already using Linux on some if not most of their servers. ",0,1379789859,null,0,false,0,cccrbbq,t3_1mtsr2,t1_cccrbbq,t1_ccclofq,null,1429388088,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Thoughts on doing this? What will my tax be like do you think? I'll be earning 13k at this new job until it jumps to 14k in a few months, and I earn about 400 a month from my current job. Just hope the tax makes it actually worth it, you know?

Mourinho has also stood by Oscar, by far our best attacking player this season and proving it week in week out. For now I have no issues with Mata not playing provided Oscar keeps it up. 

As for Azpilicueta, well it's really unfortunate because he had a great season last season, but with the way Ivanovic is playing at the moment, I again see no reason why Azpilicueta should be starting. 

I don't really believe in a Mourinho ""prototype"" per se, but I do think that he prefers his players to be more ""complete"", willing to defend as well as they can attack.

That's the official line and it's still too much.  I also don't believe it for a second.  Both agencies have lied every step of the way.  

Total digital spying on British citizens, all calls logged and stored, willingness to have people infiltrate groups to such an extent they are willing to have children, getting agents into tech / telecoms companies (not just foreign) and trying to undermine encryption. . . . . I just not ok with any of it.

I'm not sure why you personally are against them trying to undermine encryption, if you're ok with tapping fibre.  It's not like people doing the really bad things aren't using encryption.

Combined all this with things like [this](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jan/20/undercover-police-children-activists), it all scares the shit out of me how far they are willing to go to spy, monitor and try and crush any group they don't like.",0,1379792513,null,0,false,0,cccs1r6,t3_1mstkr,t1_cccs1r6,t1_cccmfah,null,1429387745,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Sturridge and Moses are good players, and both created some chances today. Sturridge won a clear penalty, Moses had a fantastic run and almost got us a goal. But other than those two chances, I don't remember a whole lot for us because we lacked the ability to get them space. It's not that Moses or Sturridge didn't see the ball much - they got on it a few times - but without a talented player like Cou/Suarez, the defense can collapse on them.

You dont make a team selection because somebody might get injured. That is just BR spinning it and you buying it. He made poor choice for back 4.

Amazing you are into, or at least party to, that whole abstract ideology and/or whatever you know seeing weird shit or understanding some heavy mind shit.

I'm too lazy and depressed to embrace that shit, like to put it on my background or whatnot but I do genuinely love it, and it looks like the spooky truths i see.

I know I talk bonkers mate, and sorry for being cryptic and shit, but it's fucking class to see a youngster love it. Fly as close to the sun as ya can, man. You were born with wings, and I bet it does your head in dealing with most people who have fuck all of the power you do. You are a potential legend, just don't urn your wings m8
