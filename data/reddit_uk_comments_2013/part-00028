So you reckon that 10% of the population might be subject to inheritance tax on anything over £325,000 left in their estate? This is a pressing problem and a vote winner for the Conservatives party?

Naively (not taking into account that people earn more the older they get, money earned younger is worth more later), that would require saving 11 years wages (pre-tax) of a probable 45 year work life. How many people do you think save or invest 1/4 of pre-tax income and still have it by the time that they die?

Over the years he has become so strong, these days if you watch him in training he is built like a tank. No wonder he can keep playing so consistently, he trains so much more than the other players that every part of his body looks like it is crafted.

If you look at Gerrard for example who is pretty similar (I'm not comparing their skills, just physique) he still has the lofty posture which might be the reason he gets injured over and over again. If you just compare Frank's thighs and shins from 2001 to today you will be astonished how different they are.

Bale also only has one assist all season, while creating countless chances.  I sometimes with we had someone on the right who could finish more.

So there has to be racism involved for this kind of pro activism then? So there you go, you answered your own question. The MOBOS exist because for hundreds of years black people have been subjugated by non blacks, including in the music industry no doubt. The obvious celebration of this emancipation is to hold an awards for the people who fought so hard to have their voices heard - in the face of all the subjugation. It doesn't only do that though, it also celebrates all the current state of affairs ( lots of non blacks making music of black origin). Fantastic eh? Or not?

The other reason is, while the characters can be broadly drawn at times, they are distinct enough from each other so that you can care about and follow their paths and not see them as interchangeable, *but* every so often they treat them three-dimensionally enough that there's a big resonant moment that a lot of people can relate to, even in nuance.

true,cacafogo,num5,,"&gt;If Bale is being marked by 2-3 players, why isn't there a ridiculous amount of open space on the opposite side of the field? Is this just due to the asymmetry of defense/offense (i.e. there are more people playing back on defense than there are playing forward on offense)

Generally, there is space on the opposite side.  Lennon has been getting tons of 1v1 situations against the opposing right back.  It also tends to open up space for our left full back to push forward since they have their two farthest right players focused on stopping Bale.

&gt;How does a team go about exploiting this... have an extra midfield player play further forward? Are we doing this? If so, why isn't it working?

Again, our left full back can push forward a lot more often, and there is space on the right to work with.  Its not working because once we (mostly Lennon) exploit that space we have no where to go with the ball, which I will address below.

&gt;And two sets of questions related to how double marking Bale could be exploited...

Lennon has been having the best season of his career, and I have no doubt that a lot of it is down to Bale drawing all the attention.  The problem is Lennon is not the person who is going to score goals.  He is too unselfish to the point of passing when he has wide open shots, and his runs with the ball tend to go toward the end line where he can put a cross in instead of driving to the goal for a shot.  Occasionally he will take the shot, and score some beautiful goals, but he is the anti-Defoe and rarely pulls the trigger.  This is a problem because of our striker issues.  Defoe is not the best person to have getting on the end of crosses, and while Dempsey is great at arriving late for the cross, he needs a striker in the box already in order to get open.  Dempsey is not good at being the point of attack, but is quite skilled at drifting around to find open space to get in the right place at the right time.  I think the main reason we have been unable to truly exploit Bale getting marked by multiple players is that we are weak at the striker position.  It is the main reason we don't have a more dynamic offense and the main reason we are so reliant on Bale.  With a top striker up front, Lennon, Holtby, Dempsey, Siggy, and Bale (whoever is playing in the front 3 midfield positions) all become more dangerous.  If Ade regains his form from last year, he can be the player to really open up our attacking options and obliterate defenses.

Edit:  Just to add a little more, one big problem we've been facing is that teams are sitting way back in their own half.  We are built for speed, great on the counterattack and in very open games.  When they put 10 men behind the ball, we don't have space to run and have to try to break them down with incisive passing and good movement.  This can also be helped with a top striker, with the movement to drag defenders out of position, ball control in tight spaces, and the vision and ability to make those passes.  Defoe certainly can't do most of that, Dempsey is okay at some but not nearly good enough, and Ade can manage it all if he decides to show up and play.",0,1360600530,null,0,1360600959,0,c8d9ydd,t3_18b3lr,t1_c8d9ydd,t1_c8d99x7,null,1431260188,10,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,10

true,TJP343,null,null,"One reason that open space isn't being left open elsewhere when Bale is doubled up is the opposition is sitting so deep into their own half that their right back and right mid can mark Bale. If he takes a pass he has limited room to operate and has to lay it off to someone else with a square or back pass. Spurs can certainly switch flanks to Lennon(which they sometime do quite effectively) but this takes time and against an opponent sitting deep they have ample time to recover position wise from such a switch.

And they do leave space when they double up on Bale(and Lennon on the opposite flank and the center forward and the advanced midfielder) but that space is left to players like Parker and the centerbacks sitting back at the half line where they can have all sorts of space and possession but can't do much with it from these deep positions.

It's not anyones fault, all teams have trouble dealing with a packed in defensive opponent with ten men behind the ball(even Barcelona). What Spurs have lacked is a Rafael van der Vaart type player who can make short, incisive passes in a tight space and slip someone through on goal in a dangerous position. Or take it upon himself to create a pocket of space for a shot on target from outside the penalty area. That's where the term ""creativity"" comes into play, unlocking a defense with slick passing, off the ball movement and a moment of brilliance where the pass and the move come together.

Spurs have lacked an in-form Adebayor this season to use as a traditional target man for crosses into the box(a common plan for breaking down a packed in defense) and Dempsey deployed behind a main striker has not done enough to drop back into midfield areas and build attacks or find space in between the defensive and midfield lines and create something from nothing. 

These two issues put more pressure on Bale and that causes him to leave his wide position and come inside, where he is less effective. That also takes away Tottenham's width which allows their opponents to close ranks even more and clog out Spurs' attacking intents.

Holtby turning in full matches like the first half of the Newcastle game can help this situation and so would Adebayor finding playing time and getting in form or a return from injury from Defoe.",0,1360600765,null,0,false,0,c8da1ax,t3_18b3lr,t1_c8da1ax,t1_c8d99x7,null,1431260227,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

As the Doctor uncovers more of them a clearer message begins to emerge, finally culminating in the Doctor bringing her forth from the stasis universe she has been waiting in with her tardis.  

They meet, share old times and she goes on her way, the Doctor now knows that somewhere out there, he is no longer alone. 

She is essentially what the muses were based on, she inspires great artistic works with well placed words.  She was always independent though, so shall not be sticking with the Doctor.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I've actually been interested in exploring ""The Silence"" as a race lately. 

I'd create a character who, through disturbingly unfortunate cross-breeding, appears human but exhibits all the traits of the silence -- specifically they are forgotten about the minute someone turns their back. I figure it must be at least plausible given just how many Silence were on earth and how long they cohabited and observed humans. 

The character would survive by sneaking bits of food here and there, squatting in peoples homes,  and stealing clothes out of the dryer(which is where all your socks go)...or they did until one day they stumbled upon the Doctor and sneak aboard the Tardis. 

Because no one can remember her she could have been there a long time. Possibly long enough to know a few regenerations of the Doctor, but considering the number of times the Tardis has been completely destroyed there would probably be huge gaps where she had to flee and find the doctor again and/or sneak aboard again. Since she's half alien (and we never really nailed down how long a silence lives) she wouldn't necessarily age at the current human rate. Her mother would never remember her and most of her childhood would be foggy due to being half-human and possibly raised by her father -- though she can't really remember for sure. 

Her introduction would be so strange because they would turn around and say ""Hello?"" or ""Who are you?"" for about the MILLIONTH time and she would already know them pretty well from following them around. In fact, knowing that the Doctor is clearly not the kind of guy to attack, she probably wouldn't even worry about what she said because it would be instantly forgotten. 

Doctor: ""Who are you?"" 

Nameless woman(bored voice): ""I'm the Tardis."" 

Doctor: ""No you're no---What?!"" 

Nameless woman: ""Of course I am. Just look."" Pointing off in the distance and as the Doctor and his companion turn around to look, all is forgotten. 

Or just walk through the scene with a ""Nope,"" while reading a book or doing some other nonchalant thing. 

The best part is she would be able to do all the fangirl things that anyone who's really familiar with the Doctor would want to do, but without most of the consequences. Like for example, if I were on a Tardis about to crash I'd be staring out the window, since you never really get to watch the crashes from that vantage point and they crash A LOT. I always thought it was weird that they don't really have crash seats, and yet, when the Doctor says, ""Assume crash positions!"" they get into the fetal position. Clearly a more appropriate crash position would be up against a wall, but WHATEVER :P 

If the Doctor started to figure it out(that he wasn't alone), she could recognize his ""realization"" face and run out of the room, keeping him from completing the thought, which is how I would explain her ability to avoid detection for so long. However, now that there is a system in place to identify the presence of a silence, it would just be a matter of time before the Doctor or someone figured it out and tried to remind themselves that someone else was there, but because she appears human they couldn't just add a tick. They would have to leave themselves little notes on their hands. Notes that would inevitably be hard to read because they can't look away while they are writing them, and would suddenly stop if she took off running. Half finished scribbled words, unless she suddenly wanted to make her presence known, or they thought to implement the thumb drives again. After all, with all of the Silence chased off of the Earth, she couldn't even seek them out if she wanted to. The Doctor is really the only feasible way for her to get off earth. 

Honestly, though it's been done to death, I would have her save the Doctor in a big dramatic scene that kills her, and because I'm a horrible person I would have her go on and on about the things she's seen him do. The people they saved together, the places she's been with him without him ever knowing, and finally as she clutches her side and dies the bittersweet of it would be when both the Doctor and his companion look away, and forget she ever existed. Or better, she could survive and simply get left behind in a horrible place, sacrificing herself by ripping off the doctors eye-drive or whatever facsimile they came up with, making it possible for her to return as a villain or a companion later on. 

Ultimately I would want her to tell the Doctor not to be such a baby about losing companions. Yes it's sad, but he should look at is as adding exciting chapters to an otherwise boring book, instead of luring small children away to their doom. She would be in a unique position to tell him to snap out of it since she would not only witness the addition of a companion, but the aftermath when they leave, and recognize the destructive cycle the doctor is in.

Another of the ludicrous aspects of freezing the nil-rate band is that IHT brings in very little of our tax income and isn't particularly efficient, so in terms of raising money it's not really the best choice.

&gt; You want good legislation? Don't let it be changed by non-European, undemocratic lobbyists with no loyalty but to themselves.

Where it came from doesn't bother me at all. Who they care most about in the world doesn't bother me at all. They can come up with suggestions all day if they like. If it becomes law then that's on the people who vote for it, irrespective of its content.

I don't see what's hard about this. They're not slipping it into some folder and then it's magically law by shenanigans. If our system allows them to pay for the content of our laws then it is our system that is corrupt.

true,ninereeds314,null,null,"&gt; I've not heard of any non-smokers taking up e-cigarettes so I don't buy the idea that they normalise smoking. Existing cigarette smokers normalise smoking.

I might, but not because it ""normalises smoking"". I'm not normal - autistic and obese for a start - and I gave up caring about being normal a long time ago.

It's the ""obese"" part that's relevant here. Diet and exercise - sure, but it only works to a point. The problem isn't as simple as will power, but that'll do for here.

People who try to give up smoking almost always gain weight, then lose that weight again when they give up trying to give up. So... why not nicotine as a diet aid?

Smoking - well, there's not much point replacing one health issue with another. OK, it's still a bit more socially acceptable to be a smoker than to be obese, but nothing on this Earth will ever make me socially acceptable anyway. Plus it's expensive. Plus I've tried it and hate it.

Nicotine gum - well, I've been trying it for a while now. So far so... well it's hard to say. I do seem to be eating a bit less - partly because when I get the urge to eat I sometimes chew some gum instead, partly because I seem to get a caffeine-like energy burst and forget about being hungry. It's even enough of an energy burst that I've been getting more exercise.

So - a substitute for will-power.

But those things *really* taste evil. The second most evil tasting thing I've ever tasted, after some cheap protein drink that convinced me I now know what the waste from a chemical toilet would taste like.

I guess the taste is unavoidable - it's probably the nicotine itself, and hopefully you get used to it over time. But I also hate chewing gum anyway. And that chew-it-for-a-bit-at-a-time, keep it in your mouth for 15 minutes (not likely) routine makes me hate it even more.

So - I really don't understand how anyone can become a nicotine addict. Sure, some nice effects, but it's a major test of will-power just to chew that evil bastard gum to get some nicotine into my system.

I agree the looks-like logic is absurd. Are they going to ban water because drinking it normalizes alcohol? Doesn't an insulin syringe look a lot like a heroine syringe? Doesn't rock salt look a bit like crystal meth?

The same is true of a Canadian, or an Indian. In practice, of course, this is very unlikely to happen. A Scottish person running for an English seat would likely be one with a British* passport, who had lived in England for some time.

I just think that too many people are trusting something which to me does sometimes seem to be inherently questionable. Tesco Value burgers, for example. Not to pick on a particular retailer but meat that is *that* cheap will evidently suffer at some point in the quality control process.

There is a qualitative difference between horse and beef of course but anyone who takes their food seriously should know, even roughly, where their food comes from. I'm not *that* picky, really. The amount I care that a burger I've eaten either contained or was nothing but horse is zero. If it tastes good, I'll eat it. We can all try our best to be ethical but being serious about your food is more than reading a label on a box in a supermarket. There are lots of good butchers out there and I'll take a reasonable punt that a significant percentage of supermarket customers likely has no idea what a well prepared, locally sourced *genuine* quality steak pie tastes like, for example.

In actuality, unless they'd lived in the rUK for some time, I consider it difficult to see how it wouldn't be an insurmountable obstacle to election, certainly to leadership level.  There'd be too many scoring points for the opposition, especially if their loyalties lie so closely divided.

Would Gordon Brown had been able to survive an uncontested ascension to leadership of the Labour Party, and then gone through the political strife without an opposition vote of no confidence, had he been a Scot in the rUK?  A pragmatic answer would have to have been 'No', and knowing that Labour itself would have looked for a more viable representative.   Even Tony Blair would have been in doubt.

Going forward, doubly no, unless again there's a dual citizenship and it's somebody that has lived in the rUK for their adult life.

true,TJP343,null,null,"If Bale kept his width more the defense back line would be more stretched out and spaces for through balls would open up. Spurs problem this season has been finding someone to exploit that when Bale and Lennon keep their width. Bale being out wide and having no one to cross to isn't Bale's fault and neither is the lack of a creative attacking mid being around(pre-Holtby).

Rinus Michels said in his book that he always told his wide players to keep putting crosses into the box even when no one was there. That way he could turn to the players that were supposed to be there and ask them why they are not getting into the box and getting on the end of crosses. If Bale plays his wide role consistently it would force the rest of the team to adapt. But instead Bale adapts his style of play, should be the other way around, he's the star man.

If they're looking to move Bale away from his wide left position the only switch that makes sense to me is to put him on the right flank let him keep his width and come inside on the dribble and take shots on his left foot. If he were able to do this effectively he would have the opportunity to beat the opposing left back, challenge a centerback and open space for others(Lennon, Holtby, Ade) or shoot for himself.

But Bale keeping his width helps him and helps the team. His wandering into the middle clogs that zone. When Iniesta comes inside from a wide left position with Barca that's one thing, Bale plays in a wide left position too, but is effective in a complete different way. Iniesta is a world class danger man in midfield, Bale is world class threat from a wide position or on the break.",0,1360607275,null,0,false,0,c8dcafp,t3_18b3lr,t1_c8dcafp,t1_c8dbhci,null,1431261242,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

Lancaster is a small city, very friendly, has more bars,pubs, clubs etc per sq mile than London, so there is plenty to do if you like drinking and lots of variation on types of pubs/bars, though there are a few nightclubs if you are a student I'm guessing you'd stick to the student nightclub the sugarhouse (thats a great night out).  It's situated near the sea (though very cold), but supposedly has the 5th best sunsets in the world.  Its a real nice location because of this, and of course the lake district on your door.  It's also on the main railway line for lots of the country, with trains every 30 mins to London (just over 2hours journey time)/Scotland (2.5 hours to Edinburgh), and loads of places in between so very easy to explore the rest of the country and get to experience british life.  It's also on the M6 motorway, meaning getting around is very very easy.  If you need the draw of a bigger city then, Manchester,Liverpool and Leeds are about an hour away on the train.  I now live here, after attending the Uni, which is ranked in the UK top 10 generally, and for certain subjects top 10 for the world.

Brighton is amazing in summer, such a great atmosphere.  Has lots to see and do, and is right on the coast so great beaches etc.  Has some wonderful small shopping arcades, where you can find some really unique things, and amazing choice of places to eat.  I don't know much about the university, I'm afraid to say though, and last time I went visiting friends it had changed an awful lot.

Both places are very much on a par for culture etc, but I would say Lancaster tips the scales for me, purely because of it's more centralised location and great travel links to explore the rest of the country.",0,1360611420,null,0,false,0,c8ddulk,t3_10yydd,t1_c8ddulk,t3_10yydd,null,1431261976,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

In Leicester I got the sense there was good integration, mixed groups of friends, there were mixed couples out in evenings. 

Gravesend had a 'model minority', Sikhs had business interests, but the standard line was given when the new gurdwara was built. 'It will be a centre for the whole community to use and hire out'. And then of course no efforts made to reach out to the wider community.

University forums I remember, and still see, south Asians asking if university X is an 'Asian uni'. As if academic quality or even good social opportunities wasn't enough. It must have (south) Asians.

Don't get me wrong. Most of this seems like surface stuff. Many south Asians, maybe most, integrate and balance their own cultural histories well.

But PLEASE remember that the job market in English towns can be very severe so if the landlord is telling you he is going to throw you out on your arse, take a day off your planned heroin and shortbread binge and try to get back on your feet. Try being sober instead or go look in shop windows or whatever else takes your fancy. London will still be there in a couple of days (or years).

Silva is just exhausted and needs time off. I think he will still play first team but be subbed more.
Aguero gives his all most the time. Tevez gives his all all the time. dzeko puts in a decent shift. I don't think anything major will change here. I could see Tevez acting as cover for Silva though.

I think Hart should be dropped but is Pantilimon good enough to step up to fill the void? Unsure. Yaya is interesting as I don't think I have ever seen him get subbed.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"Meritorious ≠ rich. Is an aid worker who gets barely anything but has devoted their whole life to charity not meritorious? Or a nurse who gets paid shit money but is driven by a desire to help people etc etc. What about those who got laid off during the financial crisis because of the disastrous risks taken and rigging done by your 'meritorious' ideologues in the major financial institutions. If you've been screwed because a banker gambled your savings away then according to your logic your 'merit' has also gone. That sounds like a hugely arrogant assertion that clearly demonstrates you have never been in need of money probably because you were born into it and have been funded by your parents or your in an industry that has not been effected by the crisis or you've been lucky. If it's the first then, hello!, there's a real world out here that you haven't experienced. If it's the second then you have to understand your situation is unlike most people's situation and many prudent hard working people can be fucked by life and forced to go on the dole. If it's the third then I assume you are aware that people have been laid off or that people's situations are often not their fault and if that's the case your just an arsehole. 

Besides the money gained for this will not necessary be used to pay to those using the governments social programs but instead will be merely pumped back into the treasury. This decision to keep the tax at it's current threshold is not going along with a rise in funding for social programs instead their mercilessly cutting most of those benefits programs and have monumentally screwed Job Centres and the disability benefits program. The money is more likely to be used to fund other projects. 

[This program demonstrates quite well how little working people actually want to go on benefits and how your idea that they have no 'merit' is a fairly odious attack.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYb0-Gtm480)

true,PampersJ,flair1,,"All the previously made points are true (lifelong uk based spurs fan here) but I would add a word of caution.

Its true, the Park Lane (South Stand), especially the lower half, is the 'rowdiest' of stands. It is where the majority of noise comes from, but that said in the lower you will pretty much HAVE to stand throughout (as everyone else stands and you can't see otherwise) and you will have to endure some banter/abuse. By abuse, either the fairly nearby away fans towards us or the opposite, it ranges from hand gestures to fairly hefty language and sadly sometimes (albeit not from our fans, and very, very, rarely) some racist stuff. I know this all sounds negative but it is true, however it is where I stand whenever I get the opportunity because I like to sing my heart out and I'm able to ignore the not so nice parts. That said, banter between sets of fans can be fucking hilarious, so it's 6 of 1 and half a dozen of the other I suppose. (The southern edge of the west stand is right next to the away fans so they tend to get a bit of 'banter' too).

If it's your first game, taking your wife and wanting a good experience, I would say South Lower, but aim to be nearer the East Stand (so blocks 34-32), or South upper with the same advice (blocks 43-39). The East Stand isn't too bad (29-31, G-J), but the North and West can be pretty quiet sometimes, but they do have their moments. 

Best place for tickets - become an overseas One Hotspur member but it's always a bit of a mad rush to get them - know what time they are going on sale and be ready to get them asap.

Before the game there are a few locations - I tend to go to Valentino's on the high street outside the West Stand. It's a pretty dingy pub (bear in mind you're in Tottenham, I don't know many that aren't), but the beer is cheap and it's home fans only. I would say I'd be around to say hi but sadly I'm out of the country over May so will miss the end of the season :( Get there (to WHL) early and have a look around in good time, then head to the pub - it gets very busy by 1-2 hours before kick off. Remember once you've entered the ground you're not allowed to leave and be re-admitted so I'd aim to be in for about 30-45 mins before kick off. They stop selling alcohol 15 mins before kick off and you **cannot** take it into the stand with you, you **will** be kicked out and arrested. 

Final point - Sunderland Home is our last game of the season, plan to stick around afterwards for the lap of honour, especially if we've secured Champions league football for next season.

On the champions League tickets, all i'll say is good luck!

Hope that helps! COYS!!

People either forget or are oblivious to the fact that in Scotland that is often not the case and if you get lost, you're lost, and there's a not a lot of civilisation if you head the wrong way.

People definitely need to be made more aware of this.

Then, though we have majority of possession, we give up a goal off of a corner and a counter attack. Can't say this is something I'm not used to...

As increasingly difficult as it is to stay positive after these defeats, there were a lot of bright spots...

Downing - Fantastic game. Dominating the attacks down the right hand side. Put some good crosses in, had a good pass to Gerrard that should have been an assist. By far out best player today IMO.

Suarez - Did what he does, minus the scoring goals. Won some free kicks outside the penalty area, not to mention the penalty. Good game. 

Henderson - Continually looking confident going forward, does well tracking back, does well pressing. This is the Henderson that I thought we were purchasing. 

Gerrard - Good job controlling the midfield today. I thought the penalty take was a good one, it was just a better save. 

Enrique - Showed excellent control and composure on the left hand side. Maintained possesion for us on many occasions. 

Shelvey - I thought this performance was an improvement. He got forward well, for the most part passed the ball well, showed a good first touch (which is usually horrible), and even scored a goal (so what if it was disallowed?). Not an amazing performance, but improvement. 

Sterling - made an immediate impact after being subbed. Bombarded around the pitch with the ball and went wherever he wanted with it. Could have had an assist on the pass the Gerrard. 

Agger - Despite an otherwide good game, he gave up the first goal. Don't see any other way to put it. 

Last but not least - 

Coutinho - Great that we got to see him. Really wasn't even enough time to shake out the nerves, but there were a couple momentary flashes of brilliance. Hopefully this didn't hurt his confidence. 

Edit: Also, this shows how much of an impact Sturridge has on the squad. This performance = a pre-Sturridge performance, as no one was stalking around inside the box.

Edit 2: okay I get it, you guys disagree with me regarding Enrique. I thought he looked pretty good going forward. Johnson, on the other hand, gave up possession almost every attack and looked really indecisive.

The latter hasn't been known for so long, so 4 weeks isn't quite a true reflection of the timescale. 

Regarding the definition of meat, you're incorrect - it's worse! Cartiledge and fat and gristle are all included under the definition of meat. I don't agree with this, I don't think normal people think of that is meat and so I don't think it should be classed as meat, it should show you the true percentage of meat and the true percentage of gristle and fat etc. Under labeling laws, Pork, for example, can include up to 30% fat and 25% gristle, leaving only 45% (the minority) to be actual pork. That means your 40% pork sausages really only means its under 20% (what we'd call) pork. It's concerning. 

In a nutshell, meat is defined as everything which 1) meets the (high) allowances of gristle and fat 2) is not mechanically recovered and 3) is not offal (heart, lungs etc) - this must be labeled as such.

Negatives - We were not clinical at all in finishing, and some of our top players had poor games right when we needed them to perform. Suarez unfortunately had an off-night right when we needed his magic. Agger was barely called upon to defend for the whole evening, but then twice made huge errors which resulted in goals. In a more general sense, it's obvious that there was some deadwood out there tonight. Shelvey is simply not good enough and Borini has pretty much proved now that he offers us nothing in attack whatsoever. Wasn't massively convinced by the substitutions; yes Coutinho might not be fully fit but he could have been brought on earlier to at least offer some invention.

Fuck it, okay. So lets get this out of the way first, we're all fucked off that at 80 minutes we'd had 20 shots to West Broms zilch. Then at FT we've lost 0-2. But! It clarifies just what we're doing wrong and how much we need to improve which perhaps we needed after two **disappointing** results away to Arsenal and Man City.

We played well away to the Premiership champs and Arsenal, but we threw away a 0-2 lead with 20 minutes to go and a 1-2 lead with about 15 minutes to go. Showing how leaky our defence is. Agger is deceptively out of form, his positioning and marking is to blame for Dzeko's goal and Mcauly's (however you spell it) goal.

Enrique looked rusty, Johnson was dreadful today no matter how you look at it. Why Shelvey was started up front after his miss for England U21's will evade logic for eternity. For that Rodgers needs to learn from that decision.  

Yes, we kept the ball very well for a majority of the game, but similarly to the Aston Villa match when a team puts pressure on our possession in our half, we struggle to keep the ball in dangeorus territory and get reduced to long range efforts like in the first half. 

What this game proved is that we aren't a top team with a lack of depth, we're a good squad with no real depth. Sturridge out and Shelvey starts upfront. That reminds me of the Wolves game a couple of years ago when Ward started upfront for Wolves... they still beat us 0-1. 

This team needs more depth. Not just in the squad but with the staff. Somehow players like Agger &amp; Skrtel aren't performing despite being Champions League quality players only a season ago. We haven't got a player like Lukaku we can bring off the bench and terrorize defences.

These are problems now but they're so clear and obvious I'd expect a child with 2 years Football Manager experience to solve them and I fully expect them to be solved by this time next season.

In my opinion it's quite a difference between ""legitimate frustration"" and saying ""by all measures we do not deserve to be near the top four"".  
The latter is needlessly adversarial, doesn't really mean anything of substance and in my view factually untrue.

A legitimate frustration, in my opinion, would be to say that we are annoyingly inconsistent, lack squad depth and continue our long and sordid tradition of not being able to finish off weaker opponnents. 

Sure, top 4 has always been a pipe dream and is sometimes a sign of unrealistic optimism, but damning the club to eternal mid-tableship is equally unrealistic pessimism.

- Shipped out Carroll when we had 1 fit senior striker
- Only Sturridge has been a good signing, Allen poor, Borini awful, Coutinho still too early to tell

I've been defending Rodgers all season, but how much longer can we say that this is progress? We've been playing good football but the fact remains that we are 9th place, BEHIND WEST BROM who have been TERRIBLE for a long time now. 

He needs more time, but stop with the ""everything will be alright"", clearly something is lacking. And the longer we languish in mid table the sooner Suarez is gone.

This year was always going to be a rebuilding year. You can almost say it is starting completely anew (key word: almost). It isn't about winning out first prem title. It isn't about even getting into the Champion's League. That's next year. And the following. And the year after that. See what I am getting at? When FSC chose Rodgers, they chose a man who has a plan, a long term vision if you will. The game isn't about getting into the Top 4 once, it is about staying there. BR laid out an actual physical plan to Henry and Co. on how to fix Liverpool Football Club during his interview (remember reading that back in the summer), but Rome wasn't built in a day. It is going to take time and as we have clearly seen there have been many ups and downs, and there will continue to be. To face facts, Liverpool just haven't been very good IN THE LEAGUE since the inception of the EPL (not the First Divison, the Barclays Premier League). We have underachieved greatly while our greatest rival has surpasses us in almost every way and in order to become great again, it takes a man with a vision and the drive to make it happen. To me, BR has these qualities in spades.

So, this was never going to happen overnight. When FSC hired Rodgers, they hired a man who wants to implement and play ""the beautiful game"". They know attractive football generates interest and interest generates money while Br knows that possession football is successful football (in the long run). It was a very rough start as we all witnessed. Worst start to a league campaign ever even. But lately we have started to see the fruit that this possession football tree bares. It has looked terrific. There is an optimism around the club that hasn't been there in ages. Players who seemingly looked out the door are now looking like the men to lead Liverpool back to our consistent winning ways. Rodgers has so much to do with that. Not everything, but a lot. Mark my words, next season with Rodgers at the helm is going to be the turnaround point for Liverpool Football Club.

* A lot of decisions have gone against us this season, but in saying that, we have played a lot of inconsistent football with a lot of tactical changes and players playing out of position.

* No excuse for this. We've been good, we've been poor - we're consistently inconsistent.

* Personally, I'm happy we got knocked out of the League Cup, A trophy is a trophy but we had a very thin squad at the start of the season and this just packed our fixture schedule even tighter. FA Cup - Oldham result was unacceptable.

* I believe he only did this because he was under the illusion that FSG would give him more money to get Dempsey in? - Something about Carroll not willing to adapt his play style to fit Rodger's system or something

* Borini - for me, hasn't shown why he is worth so much... Sturridge has been really good for us so far... Allen is also inconsistent, plays one game like a Lucas/Gerrard hybrid and the next two games he is invisible on the pitch.

I agree with you regarding eating gristle and fat, I believe we should eat all we can from the animal. Like you, I do also believe that it should be clearly labeled though. If I am told 40% pork, I trust that its 40% pork, not 18% pork and 22% fat, gristle and cartilage. Like you said though, this might damage sales so I can see why companies would lobby. 

English law generally runs along the rule of 'the common man on the clapham omnibus"". This guidance generally means laws should be understandable to everybody, so they know if they are committing a crime or not. I think the same should be the case for labeling, it should be understandable. If I told you 25% gristle, 30% fat, 45% meat, and called it ""pork meat"" - you'd probably say it didn't meet your expectation, and I don't believe it would everybody else either. Like you said, people don't know what they're putting in their mouths.

People are at their vulnerable when they are lost in a sea of information which is confusing, so they trust our Government and big companies to be honest. Nobody is ever more vulnerable than when they eat.

The Cairngorms - if you're just looking to get to the top and back down again, without having a proper wander, you can do it in a day - stopping off for a coffee half way :D But I'd recommend spending two or three days to get around the place properly, it really is beautiful.

I agree with macguire on the Isles if you're happy to travel further afield. Skye is beautiful. However, of all the places I've been to in the world, my favourite is Calgary Bay on the Isle of Mull.

true,Jimmy_Poon,lfc99,null,"**Liverpool principal owner John Henry defends dual ownership of Boston Red Sox and Merseysiders**


*Liverpool's principal owner John Henry has defended his dual tenure of the Merseyside club and the Boston Red Sox amid claims of being overburdened with responsibility for the sporting giants.*


While Liverpool supporters have never been overly concerned that their owners have alternative concerns - in fact, their successful running of the Red Sox was considered a major asset in their favour when they bought the club - it has evidently caused rancour in Boston.


A decline in results in Major League Baseball, especially last season, has inevitably created a situation where many at Fenway Park would rather Henry had never bothered moving into the Premier League.


In an interview published in the Boston Globe, Henry fends off the claims Liverpool are ""a distraction"" and points out he has been a rare, recent visitor to Merseyside.


""I think it's affected perceptions. I mean, everything affects you. But the things that have been said, repeated over and over again, are fairly ludicrous,"" he said. ""The last time I was in Liverpool I think was in May of last year. I don't know where this fraction comes from.


""You can say every major league owner is distracted if you want to try and make a case for it because they all have other businesses, other endeavors. I think they all do. The major thing is the perception.


""Imagine if I had nothing else to do other than run the Red Sox? What do you think would be different?""


Henry admitted some of the Red Sox's supporters do harbour concerns.


""I would say some of them are not OK because they read the same stuff that you write and probably some of them think we are distracted. But we aren't. Last year's losses on the field weren't the result of Liverpool,"" Henry said.


""I would say all three of us are intimately involved every day with everything that goes on at Fenway Sports Group. But every day is different. You have different issues that come up just about every day.""


Although Henry has not attended a Liverpool match this season, chairman Tom Werner has been a regular visitor and took his seat in the directors' box for Monday night's visit of West Bromwich Albion.


Werner has been in England since last week, when he attended the meeting of Premier League executives to support the proposals for Financial Fair Play.",0,1360627891,null,0,false,0,c8djc6k,t3_18c2pd,t1_c8djc6k,t1_c8diokg,null,1431264563,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

true,wagdog,flair3,,"What I see is a team winning games based on a huge collective effort. Bale's impact this year is exciting, but no more impactful than VdV's play a few years ago. Without solid backfield, and a midfielder like Dembele, Bale doesn't get the chance to use the space he needs to burst into space and hit that left foot into the far post. It has been so fun to watch him rise from obscurity and become the next best thing to sliced bread (in the media's eyes), but I think it takes a certain type of tactics to unlock Bales skill set. IMHO, he won't just plug in to any offense. AVB is good at unlocking the potential, and he certainly has focused the offense around Bale.

Gareth is trying to interject himself into a more central role, and might be able to do so, but he isn't there yet. He is an amazing left winger, and having him play on the right to cut in and shoot provides some incredible goals as well. He certainly isn't a receive, posses, turn, and distribute number 10 player yet, and it seems a bit of a waste to have him sitting alone up front like a traditional 9 (think defoe or ade, or old crouchy). 

I think Bale realizes that you are only recognized by the impact you are having on your team, and he is credited with a great deal of Tottenham's rise to the top 4. Once he moves to someplace big like RM, he is just a little fish in a big pond, with a lot of expectations and little playing time to live up to them.

Gareth should take note of what's happened to Modric on the other side of the lake this year. He is underused, under-appreciated, and no longer the media darling he was during the Euro Cup. 

I for one hope he stays at Tottenham for years and would be inclined not to sell him, although for $60m pounds...hmmm.

Was it just too hard for her to kill even a sliver of the man she loved basically resigning to the fact she'll never move on, or did she come to believe he (the robot) was to some extent, alive, and while realizing he wasn't Ash, wouldn't be right to kill him, which would be the only reason she wouldn't have him kill himself if she had truly accepted he wasn't Ash in the slightest.

The capacity of White Hart Lane is only 36,000 that's less than half of Old Trafford, The Emirates, Stamford Bridge etc. We've only qualified for the Champion's League once, and we're not exactly winning trophies on a regular basis. We sell our best players when the offers come in (Modric, Berbatov, Carrick etc.). The same thing happens at Arsenal. I wouldn't worry too much about it and just enjoy our success. We will always be underdogs against what is currently the 'Big Four', and with good reason: our record against them (especially away from home) is still fairly poor. On our day we can beat the best teams, but it's far from a sure thing. Until we have real investment, a new stadium, and are regularly winning competitions we will always be a smaller team.

Also, if we are being brutally honest we *are* **currently** a one-man team. I'm not sure what team you've been watching but Bale's carried us in the last three games, scoring all the goals and offering the only real attacking threat. The comparisons to Barcelona and Real Madrid are pointless. SAF will find out tomorrow that even if you set up to nullify Ronaldo, there's still Ozil, Kheidra, Benzema, Higuain, Alonso etc. This goes double for Barcelona. Our next most creative player is... Lennon? He's had a great season, but would struggle to displace anyone at Man City (Milner/Silva) Man Utd (Valencia/Nani), Arsenal (Walcott), or Chelsea (Hazard). Holtby has only played over 100 minutes for us, so he's hardly world class yet - but fingers crossed. Defoe? Dempsey? Dembele? Exactly.

No-one's underestimating the important work our defence has put in, but we're hardly the invincibles. We've conceded in all our games this year bar West Brom when they were down to 10 men (and they looked more likely to score than us in the first half). Turned over by Leeds, and Walker has been struggling for form. Lloris has been excellent playing the sweeper role, and is so quick off his line, but let's have him play a whole season before we call him a spurs great.

However the fact remains that that mountaineering is an inherently dangerous activity that can sometimes catch out even the experienced and well prepared. The Glencoe tragedy last month struck in good weather conditions with experienced winter mountaineers. As the MCofS say themselves:

 - soak the hat overnight in the pint glass

If you mean, 'Do Essex students look/sound/act the same way the TOWIE characters do?'. Then, for the 99% of us, we don't.

1) It's a University. 

2) It's got a huge international student population. 4,200 of Essex's 10,800 students are foreign. For the UK students, I think most of them aren't from Essex. I don't have stats for this, but I only know 1 person from Essex of the 40 people I know the home towns of.

3) Experiences vary. Different accommodation attracts different people. In order of the loudest/partiest towers, it goes;

* South Towers

* North Towers A (I live here :D)

* North Towers B (lots of postgrad students here)

* Houses / South Courts / Quays (these are very quiet) 

I suspect if you apply for a smoking flat, then you're more likely to get grouped with loudier/livelier people. 

Even living in North Towers A, I have more than enough peace and quiet in my flat. However, I can go to a few flats within my tower if I want a livelier atmosphere. If you don't like your flat, you can just request a room change, for a small fee.

Also, just a small note about conveniences/living at UoE in general. Everything is so convenient here, I couldn't have asked for more. Reading room open just about 24/7. 5 minutes to my lecture halls. 3 minutes to the SU shop, which is open 24/7 bar Sunday. Clubs/Bars/Gym/Playing Fields etc. on campus.

The concept of langar in sikhism is indeed something that is intrinsically inviting to others; and to be fair the sikhs in gravesend seem to be respected as being as 'gravesendish' as anyone else.  That said; there is still a sense of living peaceful, yet parallel lives.

Friends who went to school there suggest that they had asian friends until they turned around 16 or 17 and then a lot of their sikh friends broke off and stayed amongst their 'own kind', for whatever reason.

I suppose one of the things about the strong cultural/familial ties is that south asians will have a huge number of friends and family that are also south asian.  Yet to an outsider this can seem like they are only choosing to be friends with other asians.  A couple of asian guys on my facebook having something likr 2-300 friends, of which myself and a couple of others are the only white faces.

In a country where there aren't many asians compared to whiteys it seems to a non south asian that some kind of 'sticking to ones own' is happening here.

I could understand this is if we were talking about 1st generation - making contacts in a strange new country but this is the 3rd of 4th generation now.   South asians are as british born and influenced as anyone else.  In some ways a British born muslim has a different experience of life to a british born hindu; and yet 'south asians' are treated and treat themselves as some homogenous desi group.

re: leicester it's only my perception I guess - and there are distinct areas but the sense I had, and it was only when I was at university that I saw this, was that people did mix in relationships and lifestyle.  More so anyway than even Gravesend; where for example it was rare to see a mixed race couple.

Chinatowns seem like something people see as 'lovely' in a tourist attraction sense - wow look at the chinese food, ornaments, it's like a little bit of china in the UK.   A bit like metropolitan london types who enjoy the bangladeshi food and banglatown feel in tower hamlets.  It's certainly vibrant/different but you do wonder what goes into maintaining these ethnic separations..

I've always wondered what planning laws exist to ensure that a chinatown area 'stays' chinese.  If rents are reasonable and the place is convenient, do non-chinese simply not move in because they don't want to live surrounded by Chinese people?  Or does planning law demand that only chinese business can operate there?

it doesn't bother me as such I'd just been keen to see how the state maintains these segregated areas even for tourist purposes.

I don't see the same formal tourist-levels of separation as I do with Chinatowns (or to an extent banglatown in east london).",0,1360641755,null,0,false,0,c8dnmvi,t3_189fqx,t1_c8dnmvi,t1_c8dg8t0,null,1431266653,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

We let him ride out the season, and lets be honest, anything less than an FA cup win and at the very least a spirited epl run in would do little to save him.

All summer signings could be called a disaster. Rodwell is perma-crocked like he was at Everton (fergie was sniffing around him about two years ago.... Wonder why he never pulled the trigger?) Garcia has a half way decent game one out of every 5, and is also played out of position constantly. Sinclair gets so few minutes I'm beginning to wonder if he's sprouted roots on the bench. Nastasic is the only success, and that is purely because Lescott has been a steaming pile this year compared to last. 
We were also pathetically embarrassed in a ucl group we should have been competing to win. We lost to a team of 20 year olds in Ajax, and I have never seen a team get a schoolin like city did against Dortmund.

If I were to name a few who aren't up to it (and of course you may not agree): Shelvey-today he showed he can run with the best of them but he just isn't on a calibre that can sustain the rigors of PL week-in-week-out. Borini - maybe it's just that he isn't getting play time, but its a vicious cycle. He's not good enough to start, but he won't get good if he doesn't. Maybe I'm wrong, but I just haven't seen it in him, then again, I haven't seen much of him. How was he at Roma/Chelsea? Allen - Allen is a player who is a tough call for me to place into this category, but I've come to the conclusion that it needs to be done. He is a great lad and by no means am I saying that we should sell him. But £15(?)million for him doesn't seem value for money, and I know that when BR picked him up he was looking to overhaul Henderson, but I think with the given form Hendo has been showing it just isn't looking good for Allen in the Premiership for any time soon. 

Now I do have some other players who I think have it in them they just need to wise up, maybe go out on a short-term loan or something and return when they're the classy player they could be. Sterling, Coates, Allen(fits in this category in addition to Borini).

The company has been under pressure for several years after it was snapped up by Lea's investment vehicle, Lion Capital, in 2008 for £1.1bn. The private equity group also owns a big stake in Weetabix and has previously bought and sold several other well-known brands, including crisp-maker Kettle Foods, Orangina Schweppes and restaurant chain Wagamama.

Findus is one of several UK food brands that have been bought by international private equity investors – such as Bird's Eye, John West and Quorn. Their strategy has been to take brands with predictable sales and load the companies up with debt. They then drive down costs to boost the bottom line and pay down the borrowings.

Findus had sales of £1.1bn in 2011 – but debts of around £400m. Last September the firm underwent a major financial restructuring with new US investors Highbridge, JP Morgan and Northwestern Mutual pumping £220m into the business. Lea's Lion now speaks for around one-third of the business, which is controlled through a tax-efficient network of companies in the Cayman Isles and Luxembourg.

You're in luck - I have recently left the university of Manchester (ie in November) because of funding trouble. Earlier this year, I was the representative for Humanities PGT (Masters) students and the situation is pretty shit. Basically fees are going up because universities need to find more funding - but structures haven't been put in place to help people fund Masters degrees. Until a few years ago, it only cost £1000 to study a Masters in Manchester.

You're on your own unfortunately. You need to find people to give you grants, and you need to apply quickly. Like you said, Manchester has its own grants system and you need to find out how to access them. Contact the student services people and use their website http://www.studentnet.manchester.ac.uk/crucial-guide/ There will also be other people who can offer you grants - use google and use it now!

There's a 'governmement'/bank scheme called Professional Career Development Loans. These can be very expensive, however, and are repayable pretty quickly. I say 'government' because it's pretty much just a loan that you don't pay off immediately. BE CAREFUL WITH THESE. https://www.gov.uk/career-development-loans/overview 

There's a 'bridging hardship' fund at Manchester. http://www.yourmanchester.manchester.ac.uk/netcommunity/page.aspx?pid=1566

**Manchester will not grant you anything unless you start the course with enough to cover your fees and your living expenses**. You have to be prepared to defend all spending you make for the previous **three months** should you ask them for financial support. **YES. Three months**.

I am friends with someone who was also a representative **for the course you are going to take** - PM me and I will put you in contact.

As I said, I embarked on a Masters earlier this academic year and had to leave for financial pressures. 

Willing to help in any way I can.",0,1360653797,null,0,false,0,c8dqouy,t3_18bw8v,t1_c8dqouy,t3_18bw8v,null,1431268098,4,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,4

true,[deleted],null,null,"Your country was built on roads and mass movement. The road has a very different meaning in your psyche than it does in ours. For the majority of people, unless you're going from one unpopulated extremity to another you can be pretty much anywhere here in little more than half a day. Usually much less. You can't pick a direction and go for days.

Where you're starting from has civilisation all over the place, where you're going won't be that far away and all points in between will be surrounded by it. 

For a small island we do pretty well for different types of geography, and much of it is beautiful. There are reasons to go on road trips but little of it is true wilderness. 

I remember walking in the hills last year and stumbling upon a guy sat on a rock admiring the view. I wished him good morning, and he said ""Oh for fuck's sake"" and stomped off to pursue some new attempt at solitude. 

There'll be a gift shop, somewhere you can get a cake and a cup of tea and an older couple with their grandchildren all in matching waterproof jackets who've just popped out for the day. 

I grew up on road trips though. My dad wouldn't fly so we drove to Spain a couple of times a year. 

Highlights:

* Reversing a Ford transit + 16' caravan through a French market town on market day whilst being ostentatiously English. 

* The Belgian motor racing team that blamed us for the Heisel football stadium disaster (it was about a week later) and tried to kill us. Seems crazy now, but either both wheels of the caravan came loose at the same time or the Belgian racing team we were parked up behind one week after Heisel loosened the nuts. 

* The Spanish border police that had a sub machine gun pointed at us while they searched the vehicle for drugs. 

...and that was just one trip.

true,roobens,lfc87,null,"I've always said that Dalglish should have been given another season. Sorry to FSG, but shipping out a manager after one full season is completely fucking retarded, especially when he won you silverware. It's a waste of money, a waste of resources, a waste of the relationships that the manager has built and denies us the chance to build from season-to-season. The thing a lot of fans tend to forget about Kenny is that *the club was transitioning during his time too*, and although he spent a lot of money, he had a lot of money *to* spend thanks to the sale of Torres. It's not as if Dalglish was some manager who took over a highly successful club with bags of cash and ran them into the ground. His hand was forced on the Carroll situation, and unfortunately it was a gamble that didn't pay off. So whilst Dalglish was building his team and transitioning us toward his vision, we managed to pick up a trophy, qualify for Europe, and narrowly and controversially miss out on another piece of silverware. Not bad tbh. Yes the league position sucked; that was to be remedied *this year*. I thought Kenny's sacking was bizarre and lacked foresight from FSG. I think they're only now starting to realise how difficult the Premier League is, and how intense competition is in England. 

So anyway, all that aside, now we have Rodgers, and FSG I think have made the realisation now that investing for the long-term is the way to do it. Whether Rodgers was the man to place their long-term faith in remains to be seen, but all we can do as fans is get behind his vision and pray that the wrinkles are ironed out.

I work in the social care sector, I wish I had enough sway to offer a local redditor a nice office job, but unfortunately I don't. What I can say is there is a lot of carer jobs in Liverpool right now, they're absolutely screaming out for male carers.

People normally get put off by social care, and there are some really shitty SC jobs out there, but there are also some decent ones.

Have a look for 'Personal Assistant' roles, these are disabled people who are looking to hire an 'assistant' directly (rather than you working for a company who will want you to see 15-20 people a day, and not pay you inbetween visits). These PA jobs are normally really easy, and good pay (especially if you can find one that does sleep-ins, where you get paid for sitting on reddit for 6 hours at about £10 an hour).

The bad news is, there's no easy way to find these jobs, I had a look yesterday and there was 1 male PA role on the Job Centre website. You have to be prepared that at some point you might have to do some dirty work, but generally, not that often. What I normally say is, if you were babysitting a young lad of 6, and you got paid to take him to football matches or to take him shopping and sort his food out, would you be disgusted if you were out one day and he had an 'accident'? Would you help him get cleaned up or would you make him sit in his mess all day? It's a very small part of the job in a PA role, but it is a part of it that you have to be prepared for.

Anyone hiring a PA is normally comfortable enough to get dressed and washed themselves, but may need help getting to work or doing the shopping.

Normally these types of jobs start at 4-12 hours per week, but at a pretty good rate.

**Jim Hacker**: Don't tell me about the Press. I know *exactly* who reads the papers. The Daily Mirror is read by the people who think they run the country. The Guardian is read by people who think they *ought* to run the country. The Times is read by the people who actually *do* run the country. The Daily Mail is read by the wives of the people who run the country. The Financial Times is read by people who *own* the country. The Morning Star is read by people who think the country ought to be run by *another* country. The Daily Telegraph is read by the people who think it is. 

**Sir Humphrey**: Prime Minister, what about the people who read The Sun? 

**Bernard Woolley**: Sun readers don't care *who* runs the country - as long as she's got big tits.

We desperately need players who can go through the middle and create chances. This takes technique, creativity, confidence, and bags of team chemistry. We are lacking on all fronts. Hendo and Suarez have the technique and creativity to break things up down the middle, they just need time and they need to play next to each other. Suarez shouldn't be playing striker anymore, he's wasted there and is our best chance of playing attractive football that is effective. 

I think this game goes down to having to having no width. If you are going to play with suarez up top like in the beginning of the season, then you need 2 wingers to provide width and space for suarez. If Sturridge is not on, then Sterling AND downing need to play. Jonjo is a terrible striker and doesn't provide enough support in the middle. Rodgers instead left jonjo on and took off Hendo.

I'd suggesting you're bor-*ing* pretending to not follow the obvious - with a side-order of added pointless swearing which can only further your cause.

&gt;I love how you try and defend this post as ""reading between the lines""

I love how you try and dictate how others read yours

&gt;when I have outright pointed out to you that in no uncertain terms that it was not a vocational comparison

It just *happened* to be in the same ball park. Uh-huh.

&gt;yet your arrogance lets you assume that you know what my intentions and meanings are and go so much to tell me:

Your intentions and meanings are irrelevant if you don't proof-read and spot such obvious connections. Your other comments mean such a connection is going to be spotted, and pretending that such a connection was completely unrelated is daft, really, because you're assuming the reader won't be considering these - your reaction here actually confirms it, as do other comments giving away your attitude *in your last post alone*.

&gt;and then later have the complete ineptitude to declare:

Yes, basing responses on your comments must indeed be 'complete ineptitude'.

&gt;Brilliant, so just to summarise 

I'd concentrate on keeping up first.

&gt;(as you maybe too stupid to see this point)

Says the person refusing to acknoweldge their own posts. Go on, insult some more, it'll make you seem older.

&gt;I say some point, you incorrectly assume some other point, i clear it up and state that wasn't the point i was making, you tell me it was what i was making, and you have the nerve to call ME arrogant.

I don't have the nerve - I have the evidence :-)

&gt;Let me make this very clear: You can believe whatever the fuck you like, you can put value on whatever the fuck you like, but should you find that the majority of people judge you for it, or hold it against you don't go crying that its unfair, as they can do exactly the same.

And yet you haven't really provided any evidence for this 'majority' you think you're speaking for. I've provided examples, and your response is to get upset that they were random and not Einstein.

&gt;Luckily society isn't as deluded as you

Still assuming you represent society? And/ or that there's only one? What was that word you were complaining about? Ah yes, 'arrogant'.

&gt;and yes, people will think you are a degenerate for your views you hold

My views are now 'degenerate'? Once again, you give away far, far more about *your* outlook than you appear to  realise - you've done that at least five times now (but do another round of butt-hurt, that always covers it up well). What 'people' are these you're speaking on behalf of? Daily Mail readers? Religious zealots?

&gt;good luck in the gutter my friend.

Where I will surely be if I earn money from my looks for cash, right? Do carry on, you're saving me from reading the Daily Mail. :-)

West Brom sat in their own half the whole match and were lucky we couldn't convert our chances. Tbey didn't have a shot until just beofore their goal. This was no ""Steve Clarke tactical masterclass"", the match was in our hands.

Johnson and Enrique were horrible. Agger made mistakes for their goals. Shelvey wasn't great. Other than that they played ok, Downing was very good. I was surprised by the tactics, I thought with no sturridge we would go back to the 4-3-3 that worked well against sunderland but instead we played shelvey as a forward essentially a straight swap for sturridge. Henderson and Downing were two of our best players so subbing them was strange but I guess Brendan was gambling and going all out for the win rather than staying balanced.

As a striker who's yet to score and not really overly impressed he should have been closing down their defence at full speed, not at jogging pace.

Suarez wasnt as good as he usually is but he had no support. It meant their defenders could just crowd him out.

They pressed reasonably hard, nothing like Stoke or Man United did though. After about twenty minutes they sat back a bit and tried to hit us on the counter, which worked a treat because we lack pace at CB and Enrique and Johnson were diabolical.

A bit of both really. We played okay*ish* in the build up but lacked any sort of conviction in the final third.

Funny you should say that! I don't know if you are familiar with Ole Gunnar Soskjær (Manu legend), but he said pretty much just that in an interview not long ago. 
To put it in context; Ole went on from United to become the Molde FK manager. In his first year he won the Norwegian league (which Molde hadn't won for 100years) and cup. He said people were saying that ""Molde didn't win, everybody else just lost"" or that it was just a fluke. In his second season, he won the league again. Then he said people were more like ""well, maybe they are a bit good... But it's still mostly luck"". In his third season now, he wants to do the hattrick to convince everyone that Molde is the new big bully in the Tippeliga and he wants to be a serious challenger in Europe.

I guess my point is that even though we would win the league a couple of times, we would still not be considered a ""big"" club. If we want to be considered a big club, I think we just need to be a CL regular club and get results in Europe aswel as in the PL.",0,1360667866,null,0,false,0,c8dsd2t,t3_18bvq9,t1_c8dsd2t,t1_c8dgv79,null,1431268947,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4

If you want to make a real difference to the world- a demonstrable one - get out a pitch fork and turn over a 18 ft square patch of land that you or a friend owns and plant some seeds. If this is not possible you could always ask your friendly local farmer to lease you a small strip. 

Try if you can, to make sure you acquire a patch a few hundred meters away from the place he is growing all his pesticide and fertiliser fed fruits. Try not to encroach too much on the daughters horse yard or the quad bike track!

You know why BIO food is so popular these days? Because it's the only normal food you can get, not good food, not amazing food- just normal food. Why? Because the standard of food has been pushed down to it's lowest ever! In my opinion we should demand that from UK soil only food that qualifies as BIO can be grown, totally nationalise all the farms and employ all of Europe if we have to ( abolish the minimum wage). 

Think of the possibilities with all the land, all the decrepit out of use fields in the hands of over- stretched, under-educated, over-priiliged, under- handed sods.

The program offered no travel costs and no lunch at the work place, i was told my benefits were there for this reason. I worked it out and i had £10 every two weeks to live on after travelling to Edinburgh everyday and providing my own lunch.

The mandatory work program was slave labour under the guise of getting people back to work. Companies such as Tesco took advantage of people, i had a friend who was forced to work in Tesco unpaid. My friend was told to do something that wasn't part of their job description and when my friend questioned it then manager threatened to get their benefits stripped by saying that they didn't turn up for work. When my friend brought this up with careers advisors at the job center they were told to suck it up.

The whole system was shocking, major companies were benefiting from free labour whilst not even offering the minimum wage to the workers.

Finally. I was unemployed for about a year and a half (I'm 20 now but was unemployed since i was 18) and i was told about 12 weeks into my jobseekers program that if i did not participate in mandatory work in Edinburgh i would have my benefits stripped from me.
The program offered no travel costs and no lunch at the work place, i was told my benefits were there for this reason. I worked it out and i had £10 every two weeks to live on after travelling to Edinburgh everyday and providing my own lunch.

The mandatory work program was slave labour under the guise of getting people back to work. Companies such as Tesco took advantage of people, i had a friend who was forced to work in Tesco unpaid. My friend was told to do something that wasn't part of their job description and when my friend questioned it then manager threatened to get their benefits stripped by saying that they didn't turn up for work. When my friend brought this up with careers advisors at the job center they were told to suck it up.

The whole system was shocking, major companies were benefiting from free labour whilst not even offering the minimum wage to the workers. Very few people were offered a job at the end of these programs as the companies knew that more free labour would be available straight away through these programs. I am glad that more people do not have to go through these shocking work programs that offer no help in actually finding permanent employment.",0,1360672051,null,0,false,0,c8dstyx,t3_18ddxg,t1_c8dstyx,t3_18ddxg,null,1431269169,50,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,50

Thanks for posting this and helping to spread the word. As we explain on the site, 1882 is about singing &amp; supporting the team at any level. We target the youth games for a few reasons:
1. They are Spurs players too, they deserve the support that the first team gets and what great experience it is for them.
2. It's cheaper - £3 for members. What's not to love about that?!
3. It's easier to organise than the first team games. We have tried it at a couple of first team games but it's been a bit diluted because getting everyone in the same section is hard to organise when tickets sell so quickly.

Keep an eye on the website (thefightingcock.co.uk/1882) or twitter (@lovetheshirt) for announcements. Get yourself down to the next one and sing up!

There aren't any rules about what you can and can't do! It's a strange kind of social puritanism that forbids people from doing activities they enjoy just because other people already do that kind of thing.

What if you don't want to go to a museum or science fair, but just have a nice regular sing along and meet some friends? One of the reasons the church model is so popular is actually that people actually really like that kind of thing, and being atheist doesn't necessarily exclude you from that feeling. That's especially true for people who have been religious, for whom the social routine is often a very important part of their lives and not something they want to give up.

I don't think it's controversial to suggest that actually many aspects of church are great things. An opportunity to be involved with a cohesive group of others, with all the associated benefits of community interaction and aid etc., and a general emphasis on stuff like charity. I have no problem with atheists having similar events.

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; Is £325k a crazy amount of inherited wealth that you can live off? Nope.

You're mistaken.

Plenty of one-bedroom properties around here for less than £100,000. These have a rentable value of £550 per month - the DSS will pay that for them, never mind private tenants.

If we allow, say £150 per month per property for maintenance, that still leaves £1200 per month income on the 3 flats you can buy outright. 

That's about the adult minimum wage - yes, you can clearly, if modestly, live off it.

£325k is certainly enough you can spend the rest of your life bumming in comfort in SE Asia or S America, but if you want to stay in the UK then that monthly £1200 is enough to make your life a good bit more comfortable.

Imagine if you never had to pay rent again, never had to worry about an electricity bill. That's what an inheritance of this size represents.

If I'm understanding /u/quicksilverjack's argument correctly, then ""richest 1%"" is still a relevant figure. He refers to the ""transferrable nil rate band"" and it takes two people to have kids - if they have a single offspring then this £650k will put him in the richest 1%, ensuring he never has to work a day in his life.

In the UK at least, marriage as a religious ceremony is fairly young as an institution and mainly stemmed from the State seeking to regulate the matter, with the church being the best administrators at the time.

If it paid something, I would agree. If it led to say a qualification in whatever field you wish to work in, I would agree. But it does not. Whilst it certainly benefits the companies who get an endless supply of free labour, I don't think it *in any way* benefits the individual. The government is also not obligated to pay your travel expenses to this forced labour, which can make your situation even worse.

&gt;maybe it should; that doesn't change the above principle that work experience is helpful and stops people getting in a rut.

Meaningful work experience is helpful. Stacking shelves when you want to work in a museum? Not so much. 

&gt;this doesn't follow. are you aware of anyone who has starved to death after their unemployment has stopped?

Sweet Buddha, at least read my replies. No one is going to *willingly* take step three. You do, however, have people who have been driven to suicide by such drastic benefit cuts. Like Richard Sanderson, a father and husband, who stabbed himself to death because his housing benefit was being cut and he'd be unable to support his family (despite looking for work). He's not the only one. There's now also a worry about suicide amongst the disabled because the 'back to work scheme' is also applicable to them. Guardian article [here](http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/jun/20/jobcentre-supervisors-suicide-risk-benefit-claimants).

&gt;are you aware that there are other ways of receiving support and even food outside of the government?

Sure, you could go beg on the street. Thankfully we live in a civilised nation that at least attempts looks after those who are worst off. Admittedly, it's not always successful.

It's insane. Last I heard you have to get someone to sign off on all your hours that you volunteer for and announce they were unpaid. I think if someone wants work experience, they should be allowed to get it, but by no means should we be forcing people without experience to do voluntary work in retail chains that can certainly afford to hire full time workers.

As it is, the system this government replaced for unemployed youths apparently was much more effective than this one is for anyone. I know which of the two I preferred.

not every job has relevant qualifications or courses. sooner or later some people are just going to have to go and get on the ground experience.

well personally I disagree. I think you get out what you put in, but it sure beats losing your £60 a week anyway. That £60 is benefitting the individual.

and if I want to work in international finance? or fashion? or formula one? You can't use the 'I wanna be on xfactor' excuse forever.

Apprentice schemes pay something like £3-5 per hour without being ""jobs"".

So find them ground experience in a relevant sector. Not just whatever corporation is looking for free labour.

&gt;I think you get out what you put in, but it sure beats losing your £60 a week anyway. That £60 is benefitting the individual.

Isn't the whole point of this thread about losing your £whatever a week? The question of whether losing your only source of income due to unfair labour is moral or not.

&gt;and if I want to work in international finance? or fashion? or formula one? You can't use the 'I wanna be on xfactor' excuse forever. If you've been out of work for months, it is not the governments job to find you your dream job; it is their job to get you into a job, to support yourself and start contributing.

Xfactor? wut?

If you're actively looking for work in finance or fashion, so what? What's wrong with that?

 It's not the government's job to find you *any* job. You can read through all the terms and conditions yourself, they have no legal requirement to find you anything, only *assist* you in that search.

So lets leave all that aside, and look at the practicalities. Companies have the end goal of turning a profit. A company like Poundland which is relatively unskilled work, the amount of ""training"" they can provide is minimal - they aren't training people on this scheme for management, they are perhaps showing them how operate a cash register, check a stock system, stack shelves according to a guide etc. Realistically, that training can be provided in one day - and I'm not looking down on it, those are things people need to know to work in that environment.

So now, based on that look at Poundlands point of view: Hmm, we can get people from this scheme to ""train"" them up, and then get them for free for a couple of weeks afterwards. They are obviously coming out massively on top, the cost of ""training"" these people is obviously going to be less than the cost of paying them would be for the couple of weeks work they do. Therefore this will increase profit, the **only** aim of a company.

It was always a flaw, that I never really saw a government minister explain. Did they think that companies have some sort of community spirit that they feel they must enter this scheme?! No, of course not, they join the scheme so that they can get free labour &amp; in fairness, potentially spot some people they think have potential.

I have no objection to a work experience scheme, I do however have the following two objections to the current scheme:

1. Companies will obviously manipulate the system as it is designed. If I was head of poundland I would have been crying out to get these people in so we could avoid hiring new staff and therefore keep costs down.

2. If the person doing the experience ends up working for a period where their allowance divided by their hours worked is less than minimum wage, how can anyone support that?!

Regardless, everyone just taking any job is poor economics. You'd lose your skilled workforce.

What experience? Which bit of shelf stacking will help a CITRIX engineer, for example? How is scanning items on the cashier helping the mechanic?

If you're stuck in a rut of unemployment, how is not being employed (no pay, no security) but still forced to labour helping the individual?

true,[deleted],null,null,"OK, I suppose I'm going to have to give a little more context in order to get the sort of answers I'm looking for.

 I work for a company that is rolling this out by the end of February - which I'm assuming means it is somehow good for them, as it is a fairly cut-throat profit driven company and they absolutely don't do anything unless it makes/saves them money.

 This is the same company that 3 months ago promised me a pay rise and back pay (covering a number of months) - due to my alarmingly low annual income - I had been angling for a rise for a couple months, and upon discovering what I got paid in a year my line managers eyes widened as he read the figure - it really is quite low.  I choose to work part-time, as I have projects I am working on outside of employment, and I make no bones about making less money due to this.  I don't fully understand why working 4 days instead of 5 means I should get paid less per day, but I accept it (what's the point in asking, right?).

 Now, this promise of a pay rise/back pay was used to make me work pretty hard on this project I was working on for a couple months, as I was told my rise would be determined on how well I did.  (Now, I'm not a total shmuck, I obviously understand that this *could* have all been a planned deception, but hey, I was working part-time in a job that was OK (for the most part), and I thought - hey, maybe they will fuck me, but if they don't I'm golden, and if they do I can manage.  Anyway, they did fuck me, obviously.  After a couple months since the project ended, and me asking about the rise, I was eventually told that no one was getting a rise, and there was no mention of back pay for anyone.  I was also informed that my job was being melded with another persons job (which for the record is completely impossible - it's just a way for them to justify making me redundant).  Bummer.     

 So with all this in mind, I have to say I'm slightly concerned that the company i work for seems so keen to get in-line for this change in payment scheme so readily.

 My real question I suppose is - who does this benefit?  Will this make life harder for me?  What is the effect of implementing this change?  I am not financially savvy enough to work this out for myself - I really have very little interest in financial infrastructure.

And that's fine, because there's no rules about what you can and can't do just because you happen to not believe in any gods. ~~Actually, it's kind of ironic that you reckon atheism is about not needing people to tell you what to do whilst simultaneously telling atheists they're doing the wrong thing.~~ (Edit: Unreasonable distortion of words)

In the end, one of the reasons for religion's enduring popularity is that many people really like the social events and sense of community they bring.

my point is the glaring irony. you think the government is obliged to help you 'because it's the right thing to do' - but you don't apply the same logic to other people (real people, not the faceless state).

Your point is not complicated, it's just crap and unfounded. You seem to work off the modus operandi that **everyone** who is unemployed just sits there, waiting for the JSA money (all £50 a week or w/e it is) to roll in. Which isn't true. People do look for work, even if they're not successful. This forced labour just cuts into that time. Who's to say that being forced to do crappy labour when you have excellent skills isn't, in itself, depressing? Frankly, I think we should treat people as innocent until proven guilty.

&gt;experience in a working environment, with other people, applying and developing skills that may help them.

Which is only relevant to people who have never been employed? If you've been working 15 years (example) and find yourself suddenly unemployed, I'm sure you don't just suddenly forget how the work place goes.

You're going to develop skills that 'may help' in a relevant work experience place. Which there appears to be no examples of.

&gt;employer has a choice between candidate A - who has been out of work for 6 months and sat at home. Candidate B has been out of work for 6 months, but has spent the last 2 working at poundland.

[Citation needed]

I'm pretty sure any employer would look at the skills and experiences relevant to the position, not whether the person is at poundland or not.

&gt;nothing hypothetical about it, the government brought in workfare. Government changing laws is the reasons we're having this conversation.

It's hypothetical because it's not happened. As far as I'm aware, there's no government law planned to scrap benefits.

&gt;my point is the glaring irony.

Like rain on your wedding day. That is, not ironic.

&gt; you think the government is obliged to help you 'because it's the right thing to do' - but you don't apply the same logic to other people (real people, not the faceless state).

Sadly, I am not bestowed with mind warping powers. Do I wish people were more charitable? Certainly! Do I have some magic reality bending powers that will somehow make people more concerned for those less fortunate than them? Nope! Which is exactly why the State is needed, to look after people when no one else will. 

&gt;You think the government has some kind of moral standard that doesn't apply to actual people.

It does. It represents all people, so should always be held to a higher standard than one individual.

&gt;that doesn't mean there's anything wrong in principle with workfare.

Forced labour is always morally heinous.

not at all. I don't have to, my point stands. you seem to work on the assumed opposite; everyone on unemployment is out every day meeting potential employers, selling lemonade on street corners or throwing CV's from the tops of buses. Do you think the truth could be somewhere in the middle? 

&gt; I'm pretty sure any employer would look at the skills and experiences relevant to the position, not whether the person is at poundland or not.

of course, but if you have 2 identical candidates, who are you going to pick? the one who has done something with their time, or the one who has not? 

&gt; It's hypothetical because it's not happened. As far as I'm aware, there's no government law planned to scrap benefits.

the government brought in workfare, making you work for benefits after a certain time. 

&gt; Which is exactly why the State is needed, to look after people when no one else will.

except it doesn't...it pulls tricks like workfare. charities still exist, thank God. And the government is not obliged to help you, however much you think it is. true, no one else is either, and that is a good lesson in itself.

true,gadget_uk,eng-warwickshire,Warwickshire,"&gt; The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has this to say on the subject of flying.  
There is an art, it says, or, rather, a knack to flying.  
The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss.  
Pick a nice day, it suggests, and try it.  
The first part is easy.  
All it requires is simply the ability to throw yourself forward with all your weight, and the willingness not to mind that it's going to hurt.  
That is, it's going to hurt if you fail to miss the ground.  
Most people fail to miss the ground, and if they are really trying properly, the likelihood is that they will fail to miss it fairly hard.  
Clearly, it is this second part, the missing, which presents the difficulties. 
One problem is that you have to miss the ground accidentally. It's no good deliberately intending to miss the ground because you won't. You have to have your attention suddenly distracted by something else when you're halfway there, so that you are no longer thinking about falling, or about the ground, or about how much it's going to hurt if you fail to miss it.  
It is notoriously difficult to prize your attention away from these three things during the split second you have at your disposal. Hence most people's failure, and their eventual disillusionment with this exhilarating and spectacular sport. 
If, however, you are lucky enough to have your attention momentarily distracted at the crucial moment by, say, a gorgeous pair of legs (tentacles, pseudopodia, according to phyllum and/or personal inclination) or a bomb going off in your vicinity, or by suddenly spotting an extremely rare species of beetle crawling along a nearby twig, then in your astonishment you will miss the ground completely and remain bobbing just a few inches above it in what might seem to be a slightly foolish manner.  
This is a moment for superb and delicate concentration.  
Bob and float, float and bob.  
Ignore all considerations of your own weight and simply let yourself waft higher.  
Do not listen to what anybody says to you at this point because they are unlikely to say anything helpful.  
They are most likely to say something along the lines of ""Good God, you can't possibly be flying!""  
It is vitally important not to believe them or they will suddenly be right.  
Waft higher and higher.  
Try a few swoops, gentle ones at first, then drift above the treetops breathing regularly.  
DO NOT WAVE AT ANYBODY.  
When you have done this a few times you will find the moment of distraction rapidly becomes easier and easier to achieve.  
You will then learn all sorts of things about how to control your flight, your speed, your maneuverability, and the trick usually lies in on not thinking too hard about whatever you do, but just allowing it to happen as if it were going to anyway. 
You will also learn about how to land properly, which is something you will almost certainly screw up, and screw up badly, on your first attempt.  
There are private flying clubs you can join which help you achieve the all-important moment of distraction. They hire people with surprising bodies or opinions to leap out from behind bushes and exhibit and/or explain them at the critical moments. Few genuine hitchhikers will be able to afford to join these clubs, but some may be able to get temporary employment at them.

true,devineman,logo,,"Ok, let's actually talk about Mancini.  Here's my problem with this whole debate; people who engage in this debate seemingly know nothing about him, his methods or what his job actually entails.  You can't have an intelligent and rational conversation with people along those lines and the knee jerkness of the situation is staggering for a Club that has had more managers in the past 20 years than I've had hot dinners.  I suspect most of these people weren't actually City fans in this period and don't retain the lessons that we learnt from there.

Here's my take on it, based on what I've seen of him myself and what I've read of him from others who know him well.

Mancini like all people is a product of his environment.  In how he deals with the press, the interview styles of his old mentor Boskov have rubbed off on him and due to his lack of confidence in his English and knowledge of how the press spin things, he's purposely banal though he slips in the odd comment if need be.
He is intense and full of fire.  As a manager you may remember his touchline spats with both Ferguson and Moyes, or his emotion on Tevez and Balotelli.  He's a man who really, really dislikes getting beaten probably more than anybody I've seen at the top levels of the game though as his other mentor Erikson said about him, the day afer he is fine and lets it move on.  As a player, he was constantly banned and fined for screaming at referees and branding them cheats; he felt that Sampdoria were getting screwed by the bigger Clubs who favourtism was shown too.  He retains this mistrust of the FA and the ""big Club favourtism"" still as City manager and the mask slips sometimes.

His actions towards Balotelli are rooted in his own youth whereby he started becoming recognised as a big talent at 17 but never really woke up until his 20s when Boskov made him realise that talent isn't enough; work needs to be done too to succeed at the highest levels.  At Sampdoria though, he used to fly off the handle as a young kid about many things and the manager would essentially leave him to it. His real father-son relationship was with the Chairman, Paolo Mantovani who would calm him down and help him through.  Coincidentally, Paolo Mantovani was another man who made his money in oil as did his later boss at Inter, Massimo Moratti.
Mancini sees himself in Balotelli and sees a stupid kid with potentially the world at his feet that needs to be sometimes left alone, sometimes have a kick up the arse and sometimes an arm on his shoulder.  
Most of the occassions when Mancini challenged Balotelli he delivered, in particularly against Villa when he told him that Dzeko was coming in, against United in the FA Cup where he picked him over Dzeko despite him having disciplinary issues at the time, and Sunderland where he rescued us from 3-1 down to earn a decent draw at home.
Sometimes such as the Arsenal game and the Kiev game, he didn't pay off but he generally had more hits than misses in his City career.  

His dealing with Tevez stems almost directly from his problems with the national team.  Mancini, despite being a genius, could barely get capped by his country because the feeling was that he couldn't play in the same team as Baggio, another striker who dropped deep.  He personally was quoted back then as blaming it on the big Club favourtism, another instance of this paranoia he retained (and in the light of Calciopoli, correctly).  It also didn't help that when he did get in the squad, he had an argument with the manager who dropped him for 2 years and he missed a World Cup over it.  Mancini has said that that one mistake haunted him and just the ability to make up for it was never given to him.  In his managerial career he has constantly said that any mistake can be forgiven as long as the player feels remorse and apologises.  He's been a player himself and an argumentative one that disagrees with his manager and he understands that things are said and decisions are made in the heat of high pressure moments that aren't necessarily a true reflection of opinion.  He's done it himself in those interviews I mentioned earlier; he holds the players to the same standard as himself.
Funnily, the Tevez thing happened to him before with Figo at Inter and they won 3 titles together.  Mancini is also a deeply religious man; he said in an interview that the only three things that have ever mattered to him in his life were football, family and religion.  This idea of redemption is sort of built into his culture.

Just as an aside, there are two Mancini stories from when he was a player that I find amusing and help build a picture of the man.  One was when he was playing for Sampdoria with Veron.  Veron hit a corner a little low, so Mancini asked him for a high ball next time and got a rude response.  Mancini carried on playing until he got back into the dressing room where he stripped down leaving just his shorts on and tried to punch Veron in a real ""Come at me bro"" moment.  He's had numerous dressing room punch ups down the years as a player and a manager, it's just the way he works and shows his fire.
The other story is a lovely little reply to that stupid fucking urban myth that comes up all the time on /r/soccer about Scholes hitting a tree in training.  After a particularly harsh defeat to their rivals, hundred of Lazio fans tried to invade the training ground to attack the players.  As they were climbing the fence, Mancini decided that he'd get them off by kicking balls at them.  He removed several attacking fans by twatting them with a ball.

In how he deals with his squad is pretty standard.  Mancini is almost never praising of individual players but doesn't mind dishing out criticism.  Stuart Brennan wrote in his book about Mancini that this is probably coming from how his father, Aldo, treated him as he was growing up; not with a lack of love but a lack of gushing praise.  Mancini, like others, feels that the odd praise here and there and challenging criticism is much more motivating than constant praise.  I agree with this from my own experience as a coach, those kids who are consistently told that they are brilliant and special and wonderful tend to become worse players than kids who were treated more realistically.   The criticism drives players on to do better and ""show that twat"" (interestingly, a tactic Ferguson used to use in the early 90s according to his players) and when the praise does come it means much more to the person than normal because they know they've done a good job.
Crucially to City's dressing room though, his two lieutenants in Platt and Kidd are tasked with filling in the blanks when a player feels rejected by Mancini's attitude.  Again, these people are professionals who have spent their lives in the game, these things are very well mapped out and purposeful.",0,1360681730,null,0,false,0,c8duj0c,t3_18c8vo,t1_c8duj0c,t3_18c8vo,null,1431269967,8,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,8

true,devineman,logo,,"I keep hearing a comment that Mancini can't deal with pressure or can only operate with money which is one of the dumbest criticisms laid at his door.  At Fiorentina, he was managing a Club that wasn't able to pay its debts or its players and the fans were rioting.  After winning a Cup there, he left because his families lives were threatened.  At Lazio, all of his superstar players were getting sold and he took a group of players who haven't been paid for six months to Cup success and very nearly European success.  At Inter he inherited a team that hadn't won the league in 25 years and had watched its neighbours AC Milan win everything.  The idea that he can't cope with pressure of a title race at City when he can cope with a dressing room of people not getting paid and an owner telling him that the Club would be going out of business if he didn't get results (and having his house attacked by fans) is asinine.

People talk about his transfer dealings.  This is a gross misunderstanding of what a modern manager does.  There are two types of manager; one who does everything and one who coaches the team whilst a DoF deals with contracts and transfers.  At City he is the second type.  Strangely for Italy, Mancini was actually the first type at Fiorentina and Lazio which is a huge rarity and more down to financial problems than anything else.  He picks the players he wants and leaves the rest to somebody else.  

In his first six months here, despite having a really unbalanced squad he signed only Patrick Vieira.  He understood that as his Sampdoria mates (Platt, Lombardo, Salsano, etc, etc) weren't all there yet he had a firefight on his hands and needed a mouthpiece in the dressing room.  He steadied an awfully rocky and sinking ship and missed CL qualification by one goal from Crouch.

The next summer he built his team, like every other manager who has ever existed.  He got rid of some players, he brought some others in.  He recognised that our squad just wasn't good enough for the title hunt and set about replacing players who didn't want to work (Robinho, Ireland), players who weren't good enough (Benjani, Garrido) and players whos drawbacks didn't have a good enough upside (Adebayor, Bellamy, Onohua).  I can't stress this enough, this is absolutely normal behaviour for a new manager for takes over somebody else's squad.  The difference was in the quality of player we could fill those gaps with in our budget.

I also want to point out that at this point, two of City's current spine and somewhat indispensible players in Kompany and Hart were nobody.  Hart was out on loan and hadn't played a game for City in 18 months when the highly experienced Given came in.  Kompany had mostly played defensive midfielder and publically stated that he thinks his future was there.  In fact, Kompany was seen as a bit of a wildchild before he came to City and got into a mess with Hughes when he arrived.  I think the decision to drop the highly experienced Given for the much younger and somewhat unknown quantity of Joe Hart is right up there on the decisions that Mancini has made.  Hart had a good season out on loan but the question mark was around whether this was a one off or not and could he step up to the quality needed for a title winning team.  I also think the decision to move Kompany back and put Lescott as his first choice instead of Kolo (who was captain at the time)  was another masterstroke.  Our problem under Hughes was a leaky defence and Mancini had it fixed within six months of arriving, without spending a penny.

His critics tend to constantly throw out lazy bollocks that isn't really thought through.  At this point it was that he was ""typically Italian and too defensive"" mainly based on a parking the bus at the Emirates after we had a player sent off early doors.  But Mancini was doing what he has done at every single Club he's managed; he closes the defence, gets the attackers right then deals with the midfield.  He's done the first two at City though he needs to re-do the attack now that Balotelli is gone and Tevez looks like he will be off in the summer so unless we send big then the midfield thing might have to wait another season.

Motivationally he's been excellent over his tenure.  For the first time in my life, City have a real winning mentality.  He consistently spoke about getting the players and just as importantly the fans into a mindset whereby they were never beaten.  I think the big breakthrough here was the 3-2 FA Cup game against United.  We were 3-0 down at halftime and had Kompany sent off for the softest tackle ever, then switched to three at the back came out the second half and frightened the life out of Unied.  We'd had big challenges before this but this one performance kickstarted our attitude in the title run in so that we always seemed to come back from behind in games like Sunderland and Chelsea and obviously QPR.  I was still pretty confident against the Saints even at 3-1 down the other day, we just don't ever think we're beaten any more in our heads until the final whistle which is a huge thing in football.

One of Mancini's great achievements is how he has dealt with Alex Ferguson.  Fergie is a bit of a bully  but Mancini just seems to have his number mentally.  I'm not sure if it's the shadow of the 6-1, or the fact that United have gone from being miles ahead of us to having results decided in the 90th minute now, or if he can see which way the water is running.  There's a mutual respect there and Ferguson has said some enormously complimentary things about Mancini and vice versa but Mancini just doesn't engage him in his games the way that other managers do.  In fact, when Mancini walked into City he pointed at the Old Trafford ticking banner and said ""I'm going to make you tear that down"" and he did, beating United along the way to the FA Cup.  

Tactically Mancini has been wonderful.  I could list probably 30 games that he has completely changed with his substitutions and City are actually the highest scorers post-substitution in the entire league for a few years running now.  The problem with the criticism here is that people aren't attentive enough or just don't understand tha game.
Firstly people see Tevez coming off for Kolarov coming on when we are losing and go mad.  I cannot describe how fucking silly their idea of football is.  Having more strikers on the pitch doesn't make you more likely to score, that's why people don't play 1-1-8 formations.  Having badly performing players no matter how talented they may be doesn't make you more likely to score either.  The shape is the important thing and we have players who can play in numerous positions on the pitch, and Mancini likes to change shapes when we're losing to give us a different attack vector so you end up with weird looking substitutions like this.
Secondly, Mancini often makes a defensive substitution before he makes an attacking one. This is because defensive substitutions are more important when you're losing than attacking ones.  This is simple football theory but scoring another goal is useless if you are still conceeding for the same reason.  Better to shore up the defence, analyse if it's helped to attacking efforts (because other teams have to react to changes) then make the attacking one if needed.
I also think that some of the football that we've played under Mancini has been exceptional and I could count the performances like the Southampton one on one hand during his reign.  

Player wise, I'm hard pressed to find somebody who has regressed under Mancini.  Kompany and Hart have become icons and Kompany particularly has gone from bit part midfielder to Captain and leader, Lescott became solid, Richards became a great squad player, Zab became on of the best right backs in the league, Barry became the lynchpin of the season, Milner has grown into a highly capable squad player.  Perhaps you could say that Tevez was better under Hughes by his goal record but to be fair we're playing him more in a Mancini-like deep lying forward role than Hughes who played him as a main striker.  Yaya Toure has gone from a defensive midfielder at Barca who couldn't get on the bench to one of the most respected players in the world.  Silva has gone from a bright prospect in La Liga to one of the best players in the world.  I think on the negative side you can only really say Kolo has gone backwards but this will happen with age and months long bans for drugs.  

I think from the time that he has taken over, he has improved every part of the squad and the football side of the Club.  We went from strugling to get in the top six to Champions under his leadership.",0,1360681763,null,0,false,0,c8dujar,t3_18c8vo,t1_c8dujar,t1_c8duj0c,null,1431269970,7,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,7

true,devineman,logo,,"One of the problems with the idiotic people who criticise him is that it's impossible for him to win in their eyes.  If he doesn't win the league he's a failure.  If he does, it's because our owner has money.  It's this ridiculous standard that he has been held up against that I object to.  And all because they want to bring in Mourinho, a man who is third in the league despite having an immense squad and one of the best players who ever lived playing for him, has had public fallouts with his squad and has been branded as an arrogant idiot by his players.  The same standard seemingly doesn't apply there.  This is what you get with a football education based on playing FIFA.

So no, I don't think we should sack him.  I don't even see what he's done wrong.  Only one team can win the league every year and after drawing on points United improved their squad more than we did.  City are in a bit of a building stage again after last year's win to transition us onto a sounder financial footing.  The idea that our manager should win a trophy every year or be sacked is just offensively stupid.  Applying this standard to any other Club in the league would have you laughed out of the training ground.  Did United sack Fergie last year because he failed to win the league?

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"&gt; There are systems in place for people who fraudulently claim benefit.

we're not talking about people fraudulently claiming benefit. we're talking about people out of work, not attempting to find work.

&gt; Again, you're working under the presumption that everyone who isn't working is just sat there.

not at all. they don't have to be sat there, they could be doing all sorts. but I think your evasion on this question shows you know the answer; an employer would rather have someone who has done something in a working environment recently than not. 

&gt; Yes, so? What does that have to do with a bill to scrap benefits?

nothing, you raised that non point. the point is government changes all the time, and has no obligation to you. it can pull the rug anytime it likes. 

&gt; Yes it is. That's pretty much the backbone of the benefit system, the NHS, the police. All of these come from the State as a means of helping you in a variety of issues. The qualification for JSA is be an adult, live here, don't be working. How is that not 'obliged'?

there is no law the government must abide by. it is the law, it makes the rules. if it wants to start removing benefits unless you work for poundland, it will. if it wants to reduce benefits or cut the NHS, it will. you can't stop it. it's not obliged by any force. 

&gt; Me? Fine.

oh good. no problem with workfare then. 

&gt;  Though, ""Three judges ruled that the regulations under which most of the schemes were created are unlawful"" means the current system is still terrible.

it doesn't mean that at all. it means it was technically illegal, and once the government fixes the law it will be back (apparently today).

Your company hasn't done this early, and isn't keen to do this to save money, they have left it until absolutely the last minute. HMRC have said that this new system needs to be up and running for most companies by the end of March (which is when the tax year in the UK starts for those of you who didn't know, it's March to March), and this seems to fit in with what you've said, that they are very cut-throat and leave everything until the last minuet to save money. 

I've just set this up for my partners company on Sunday, and had to install some new software and go through a whole load of forms, paperwork and questions, and even for a small company with only a few employees it took absolutely ages. It seems once it's up and running that it's a fairly simple process to do (although I'll have to wait until the end of March when the first results are due in to provide more detail about that), and it seems that it will save time when it comes to the end of year calculations, but it isn't going to save time overall, it works out about the same as the previous system. There's no money saved and no money lost by using this new system. So with regards to your financial situation within your company, nothing has really changed so carry on and ask for pay rises as if this isn't happening.

There are things however that have increased the administrative burden on companies, and from my own experience are taking ridiculous amounts of time, such as the new pension system that the government has introduced, which is a nice system, You pay 50%, your employer pays around 40% and the government pays 10% (tax relief) so the more you pay now then you get exponentially more pension for ""free"", however it's an administrative red tape nightmare for employers, as every employee can be on a different pension scheme, and can change schemes, and can ask for it in different ways and just a whole bag of hurt.",0,1360683062,null,0,1360683386,0,c8duux8,t3_18cudz,t1_c8duux8,t1_c8du1iq,null,1431270129,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Thinking Mancini has made a mistake in tactics is not stupid.  It's subjective.

This thread is one i posted a while back for the United game. It basically has everything you need to know about nearby bars, thanks to bovinejumpsuit's elaborate answer.

For tickets, the official website hasn't released them yet. It's only like 2 weeks before the game that they're open to general public. you can try http://london.craigslist.co.uk/
Juste type tottenham and you will find a guy selling them. But those are more expensive of course and 1% of the time it's not really legit. But keep that in mind as a last option.

The best atmosphere for singing and shouting is definitely park lane (east stand). South is still cool (I recommend that one), and North is for families so it's much calmer. If you decide to go insane there's always the executive box and all that.

And for champions league i have no idea, but it's quite far ahead so you'll probably get tickets, but someone must show you how, could be tricky.

true,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"The usual strong, evenhanded commentary from Paul Tomkins.

There are still a lot of question marks, there are still a lot of bright spots in the future, and there's still a lot of time left in the season, not for a 4th place spot, but for the squad and for Brendan Rodgers to show who they are and who they will become.

Tomkins concludes his column with this:

&gt;I remain patient about Rodgers, but still undecided. As I said last week, even at worst I don’t think he’s going to ruin Liverpool with his buys and his playing style. So I see no need to panic; this is no Hodgson, driving fans and players away. But equally, he’s not the only manager around who can create a side that plays good football, and plenty of them have proven records of success, too.

&gt;Changing manager again would have its downside, and I’m not advocating it; but it’s wrong to think that Rodgers is the only possible solution. If results don’t pick up, then maybe change will be required again this summer.

&gt;Equally, Rodgers has the rest of the season to show that his style can be matched with substance, too. If he does that, then he’ll certainly have next season to try and take things further, and work on eradicating the shortcomings of his current side.

Tomkins is right: Rodgers isn't making the team worse - and whether he stays at the club for years or is fired this summer he will have laid down a solid foundation for the future - *but* Rodgers isn't the only manager who can continue building upon the style that he has implemented.

Rodgers was given a lot of leeway this season (first year, working with players that aren't ""his,"" etc. etc.) but I think next season the expectation must be clear: a Champions League position.",0,1360690763,null,0,false,0,c8dx4w7,t3_18dxjd,t1_c8dx4w7,t3_18dxjd,null,1431271206,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

Don't set up a business where the first question is 'What business should I set up?' and the second question is 'Using only x amount of capital'.

That said, caution to the wind, and you're an idiot if you listen to a stranger on the interwebs when it comes to business and take it at face value...with a whole load of caveats attached..a cheap business entry model that can bring in tall stacks in a short period of time, quick out of the stalls?  

It's called a burger/fast-food van.  

Even then you want to be extremely careful where you pitch and to make sure what requires a sales license because some very dubious people move in these circles, but if you don't mind working long hours, chasing the festival scene, standing up for yourself when people try to muscle you out, and maybe being somewhat arithmetically flexible when it comes to how many burger buns you sell and how many you throw out - one van can easily turn over in excess of....well, you look it up, but we all know they're rip off merchants and they get queues.

It's one thing for fans to be saying ""well, we played very well and we look very promising,"" a fan's job is (in part) to support the team. But it seems to me like Rodgers is being a bit too supportive. At a certain point you've got to say 'well, lads, you put in a good effort, but they don't give out champions' league spots based on effort.'

I genuinely have no idea of course, but I wonder how many of the mental errors that have led to goals in recent games are in part because of this atmosphere of ""as long as I try my best it's fine.""

Your examples are anecdotal but I have found that Sikhs are a lot more conservative and traditional than Hindus (don't think I need to mention how traditional Muslims generally are!) The only times I've really encountered people talking about caste has been from Sikhs - ironic because Sikhism was supposed to get away from the caste system.

&gt;  In some ways a British born muslim has a different experience of life to a british born hindu; and yet 'south asians' are treated and treat themselves as some homogenous desi group.


Immigrants and minorities are often treated like this. Look at how Eastern Europeans are all lumped together whether they are Polish/ Latvian/ Lithuanian etc. But if you talk to Eastern Europeans they will say they actually stick together despite their different nationality. Same goes for South Asians - Pakistani/ Bangladeshi/ Indian will often see kinship with each other because of the immigrant experience.

As for Leicester, it is generally considered to do integration quite well (remember reading an article about it in the New York Times years back) but I guess compared to places like Bradford or Oldham that might not be saying much. It has been theorised that the reason for that is the *type* of immigrants Leicester has had. Their Asians are mostly from East Africa so are often middle class, better educated cf. Bradford's poorer, less educated immigrants from rural Pakistan. 

&gt; it doesn't bother me as such I'd just been keen to see how the state maintains these segregated areas even for tourist purposes.

I don't think that is down to the state but I believe it's down to estate agents.

BR was in charge of Swansea for what 2 seasons? and he made a lot of improvements but at the time Swansea had been playing his type of football for some time (1-2 year i believe it started with that Wigan dude Roberto Martinez). LFC has had a little over half a season with this type of football.

So what is my point? Well after horrible individual performance (like the one we just saw) fans should criticize the team and players because that's what fans do, but calling for BR head or telling Shelvey to fuck off is taking it a step to far IMO. Shelvey is a young player who might need to work on his attitude a little but what 20 year old shouldn't  :) BR needs time to implements his way and im pretty sure FSG are going to give it to him which i think is good.

Equate same-sex marriage with straight marriage: equal marriage for all. Grant someone/a group a marriage licence if they consent to carry out any (equal) marriage. If they will not: no licence. I'm not sure that any religious group can claim discrimination if they're ""not allowed"" to marry people, after all people can get married in a civil ceremony but still receive the blessing from their chosen faith - that's surely the important aspect. This would be similar to the French (etc) system.

However: the CoE *must* perform equal marriage. CoE being the state sanctioned religion, if it were not to do so then the government is effectively backing discrimination (let's ignore the religious exemptions to the Equality Act for the moment). While the CoE remains the UK's promoted religion, they should comply with legislation. If they do not wish (as a whole) to perform equal marriage, then disestablishment is a happy compromise. They get to ~~discriminate~~ stay clear to their consciences and the state does not openly discriminate against anyone.

Though on that last bit - will people continue to buy tickets, jerseys, and will the media attention decrease if Bale is let go, even for 60M?  The bigger financial picture is that a big star will generate buzz, fandom, and attention.  Can't put a direct price tag on that - take the MLS league for example with the [retiring] star players - they *sell* seats just being on the roster.  Any stadium where Becks appeared, seats were full.  NY's flagging attendance was bolstered by Henri.  Granted, Spurs are a MUCH larger organization with CONSIDERABLY more talent, but the scenario scales.  Big stars going elsewhere, or a club that is unable to retain a club-dedicated talent (like Bale) won't be able to attract more big talent (AVB, Holtby, Lloris, Dembele) and eventually relegate themselves to mid-table status.  We've been top-drawer for a few seasons, now.  Look how long City fought to be a top-tier squad - and they remain there because of being able to attract and pay for big talent (and a talented manager).

Chel$ki is a good example of how all the petrol dollars in the world can't buy a winning football team.  Team.  I look at a Blues game, and there's only cohesion when they're dominating.  Ruffle them up a bit, and they crumble.  Their manager lives with a sword over his head.  At the end of the day, it's still football, and it comes down to how well the 11 men on the pitch play together, not how much they're collectively paid.

&gt; He's obviously not able to motivate anyone

How else do you explain our numerous come-from-behind wins.  That looks like the actions of a team that is motivated to me.

&gt; he's lost the dressing room.

You've established this based on what?

&gt; He's got basically the same squad minus 2 bit part players

He's got a slightly weaker squad than the one that won the league on *goal difference* in injury time of the last match of the season, and narroly edged out a team that has since gone away and strengthened significantly.

&gt; He constantly changes tactics

Because teams have figured out our approach and pack their defenses.  We come up against defenses that packed like a brick wall and rather than try to find alternate ways around the wall would you prefer that we just keep banging our heads against it incessantly?

&gt; His interviews and actions all wreak of desperation.

One man's ""desperation"" is another man's ""passion"".

&gt;We get a shot at the special one in the summer. 

Yeah, now there's a manager that has lost the dressing room (this based on quotes from his players rather quotes from newspaper editorials).

&gt; The team has regressed... All summer signings could be called a disaster. 

Yes, I agree that the team has regressed, we've lost a couple of very strong players and Brian Marwood (who has since been replaced in his Director of Football role) didn't procure adequate replacements. I wouldn't call our summer signings a disaster - they're mostly a mixture of disappointing and young.

&gt; We were also pathetically embarrassed in a ucl group...

...that contained the champions of 4 major leagues.

&gt; Do you really think the FA cup and the league really came down to Mancini and nothing to do with the cash?

Of course not.  The cash has been a major factor, but so has Mancini.  Why must it be one or the other?  Do you think United being 12 points clear comes down Ferguson and has nothing to do with the fact that United are absolutely fucking loaded too?

&gt; The whole van persie saga in itself shows you his shortcomings.

""His"" referring of course to Brian Marwood.

&gt; He failed to bring in any top talent.

Brian Marwood again.

&gt; it's silly to tie the fate of our whole club to a player who doesn't even play for us.

You don't think that there's any relevance to the fact that 2 teams finished level on points and one of those teams picked up one of the finest strikers in the world, while the other team was continually frustrated in the transfer market (because of Brian Marwood)?",0,1360695636,null,0,false,0,c8dyoos,t3_18c8vo,t1_c8dyoos,t1_c8dssby,null,1431272063,3,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,3

And no amount of casual 'advice' from people like yourself does any good? That some people receive professional care from the top clinicians and the best they can do is effectively make someone comatose?

Did you know that no amount of will power can make that happen? Do you know any statistics for mental health? Do you know how hard people that work in mental health **try** to make things better for everyone in their care? Are you one of those people that will tell an anorexic to ""just eat a sandwich""?

You know, I'm glad you find change an easy thing. Its really good for the soul. Some people are not so lucky.

true,spoonracings2k,BnW,,"name me one player besides Zabs that is play at his level or better than he was last year. His players won their championship last year, and it is largely up to the manager to keep them motivated... Something Mancini obviously can't do, seeing as he's resorted to publicly insulting his players form in the media. In regards to the ucl, yea we didn't advance against 3 other league champs, but we didn't get a SINGLE win. We weren't even a factor. Mancini was out thought time and time again, by better coaches with lesser teams. Inexcusable to not even put up a fight. I don't quite understand your logic in blaming Brian marwood for poor transfers. Sure, he does most of the recruiting and negotiations, but its ultimately the manager that gets final say. And how could the manager not be a factor in attracting talent? Its common practice that potential transfer targets at any club speak with their potential manager about what their role would be at the club and what would be expected of them. You think Rvp went to stretford for the lovely weather on that side of town? Mancini's way of selling the club to transfer targets is obviously flawed, seeing that he was 0 for 3 for his top recruits ( hazard, rvp, de rossi) And yes, moaning about Rvp is a pathetic excuse for saying why were getting our shit pushed in. He has nothing to do with our form or style of play this year. It's not his fault at the same point last year, we had scored 20 more goals and 10 more points. Rvp wasn't around then for us and he's not now, it's just plain sad for a club of city's stature to blame one man not even at the club for this poor form. Look, I'm not saying he's a bad coach, but I think his ability has taken city as far as they can go with his philosophy. He's good at building teams and sustaining good play for a few years, but winning a domestic cup and a league is all he has been able to do his entire career (god help me it feels weird to say that about a manager at city, seeing as just a few years ago we were ranting and raving about Sven and Jo bringing us into the top half of the table) he's not a bonafide long term winner. He took a rich and already gifted inter squad to the scudetto and failed miserably in Europe. Jose came in and won the ucl with the same squad after he left. He's capable of great moments of brilliance, but more often than that he will do something as silly as fielding 4 full backs like he did against Southampton Saturday. As much as it sucks, after you're hired as a manager whatever's on your cv and what you've done in the past means fuck all. Al Mubarak doesn't really care about what he's been able to do in the past because, frankly, that doesn't mean anything to how the squad is doing right now... And right now, there is not a single player on the team playing at a similar level to where they were last year, and quite a few that have fallen off. The team is full of dead weight that was compounded after the summer signings. The chairman, like all other team owners in football, evaluate their manager based on a season by season basis. What mancini achieved last year does not matter, nor what he did at inter or fiorintina. What matters is the teams performance this season which has been worse in pretty much every respect as compared to last year",0,1360697840,null,0,1360699346,0,c8dzf11,t3_18c8vo,t1_c8dzf11,t1_c8dyoos,null,1431272444,1,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,1

However as it seems from your ""points"", you appear of the mind that the crowning pinnacle of a successful person is being on television ala carole smiley, and some 2 bit bargain bucket body CBBC presenter, may i suggest you audition for big brother? it seemingly has lots of people who i would consider ""like you"" both in terms of cognitive function and also ""class"", this will enable you to feel good about yourself, and perhaps you could commemorate your achievement with a tattoo? then you know you have made it and can kick back as a winner, perhaps reward yourself to a holiday in ibiza or maybe butlins.

Ill just remind you again, there will be no encore, there will be no reply (i wont even read it btw, just straight up delete, so i wouldn't bother)

Good day.

It feels like we're doing this now. I take your point that we have earned plenty of points at the death, not to mention the superb 2nd half fight in that cup tie last year. But for most of those games, there've been other ones where we've mostly run out of ideas after 70 minutes squandering our scant few genuine chances.

&gt; I wouldn't call our summer signings a disaster - they're mostly a mixture of disappointing and young.

I agree. All these guys are good players, and the core team is intact from last season.

&gt; ...that contained the champions of 4 major leagues.

Now c'mon. It was a hard group, ok. But after that Ronaldo gut-punch did we ever really look like a team who were playing for a European championship? No, they were tepid performances and we should have done better. I don't know how any of us could possibly be satisfied with our European performance this year. The fact we were playing in such an impossibly hard group may be an ok excuse for not progressing out of it, but not for the shitty effort against Ajax.

They are just letting their education or skills go stale doing something totally unrelated to their field, which they may just be struggling to find a job in. Even people with engineering, IT, finance skills. Would it not be better to give them courses, skill refreshers, and yes even targeted placements? 

I am not opposed to people working as a part of their training and education while on benefits, but why send them doing something totally unrelated? It's pointless, they are given experience cleaning canals to try and leverage in an interview for database administrator or something. Sure it shows a work ethic, but to me it also shows someone rusty and out of the game vs candidate 2 who is coming fresh from another job. Business can be harsh. Instead get them in as interns or temp workers, where the company is required to pay a certain wage (giving incentives for joining the scheme and also allowing lower pay than permanent staff with less hours or less responsibilities, and rigorous oversight) 

I understand the urge to make people work for their benefits, but for a moment look at it like this: Imagine that these ""scroungers"" didn't exist, and everyone on benefits was a genuine work seeker. A person working as an engineer in construction loses his job of 10 years. Things are bad at the moment so he is up against 10 or 20 others each time. Would you still want him out cleaning canals while he tides himself over to his next job? Someone who already paid in to the system for years?

**Season 1:**

E1: Rose. The introduction episode. Someone cheesy, but still a great introduction for new Whovians.

E6: Dalek. Introduction to one of the Doctor's most hated enemies.

E9-E10: The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances. First two-parter. Very creepy. Introduction to recurring character Jack Harkness.

E12-E13: Season 1 2-part Finale.

**Season 2:**

E0: The Christmas Invasion. Christmas Special. Overall OK episode but introduces character.

E4: School Reunion. Maybe? Reintroduced Sarah Jane from Classic Who, and really the only redeeming part of this episode.

E5: The Girl in the Fireplace. I absolutely loved this mini-love story.

E6-E7: The Rise of the Cyberman/The Rise of Steel: Introduced Cybermen. Villain is quite campy.

E9-E10: The Impossible Planet/The Satan Pit: Amazing 2-Parter, with an awesome monster.

E13-E14: Army of Ghosts/Doomsday: Season 2 2-part finale.

**Season 3:**

E0: The Runaway Bride. Christmas Special. Fun little romp. I just find episodes that introduce characters to be important. Introduces later companion Donna Noble.

E1: Smith and Jones. Introduces character Martha Jones.

E9-E10: Human Nature/The Family Blood. Greatly written 2-parter.

E11: Blink. One of the greatest episodes of Who. Very different from other episodes, and very creepy. The Weeping Angels are one of the best monsters in New Who.

E12-E13-E14: Utopia/The Sound of Drums/The Last of the Time Lords. 3-part Season Finale.

**Season 4:**

E1: Partners in Crime. Doctor reunites with Donna Noble.

E9-E10: Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead. Another creepy and sad 2-parter...

E11-&gt;E13: I can't write much anymore gotta go :(

**DT Specials:**

End of Time (P1&amp;2): Great sendoff of the Davies era to usher in the Moffat Era.

seeing as theyve won 3 league titles, 4 FA cups, 2 league cups and 2 community shields in the last decade, and a ucl victory with an interim manager, id say roman may be doing a few things right

&gt; City are in a bit of a building stage again after last year's win to transition us onto a sounder financial footing

rebuilding? the only significant offloading theyve done is adebayor, and we still pay a good chunk of his wages just to get him off our payroll.  de jong and johnson were bit part and were probably paid accordingly in proportion to the Yaya's and Tevez'.  garcia was a regular first teamer before and his wage probably refelcts that, and coupled with sinclair and nastasic, those 3 combined probably make as much per week as we offloaded in the summer.  there's no such thing as ""rebuilding"" a squad that is still intact and won the league last year.  the only thing to do is get better, and that hanst happened

&gt; I don't even see what he's done wrong.

seriously? the team is worse off in every respect and has even more deadwood amongst it.  2nd would be a fine finish, but lets not forget were only 4 ahead of Chelsea and 5 of a rampant Spurs squad.  if this form continues we would be lucky to finish 4th.

8 years. 8.  the only reason Arsene wasnt sent packing 4 years ago is because Kronke literally does not give a shit about Arsenal.  since Arsene has managed to secure the boat loads of money from the UCL matches, he could give a flying fuck as what trophies they win.  hes a pure business man who just wants to pay off his stadium and recieve a modest return on his investment.

true,wagdog,flair3,,"You make great points about our wage structure and I think that if the Financial Fair Play is activated we will see some direct advantage from this. Having Dempsey on board does give a lot of exposure to Spurs in the States (ie – hopefully more kit sales and tottenham support).

Given that they are constructing a new stadium, courting players, and making serious runs for the Champions League, one would have to assume that Levy is trying to turn the Big 4 (along with MC) into the Big 6. This momentum is encouraging and should prove in future years to put us in the mix of consideration for many big players moving up from clubs a bit lower in the bracket.

I still don’t agree with Spurs being a one man team. Dembele has become my favorite player to watch and I like him more than I did Modric. He’s stronger and almost as nimble on the ball. We suffered greatly when he was injured and to me, he is the glue that holds the offense together. What started as an exciting season for fans, soon became an excruciating drag through the mud as we endured an awful Fall without Moussa. Immediately upon his return, however, the pendulum swung up once again.

Check out this stat: http://i.imgur.com/kB76n.jpg

It’s undeniable that in the last three games, without Bale we would have likely lost two and drawn one – he was most definitely the only game changing man on the pitch that could finish. (Holtby sure made some decent looks  against NC though). However, I think that is because Ade was gone off to Africa and Jermaine has been injured, leaving us Harry Kane? We need pure strikers - AVB sees this and keeps chasing. These last three games were Dempsey’s chance to claim some ground up front – sadly he didn’t produce.

Whats frustrating to me is that we have a 6’3” striker AND we have arguably the best crosser in the league (Bale) and Ade only has 2 goals this year. That’s like turning away free lunch everyday Ade. Adebayor is 2/23 in shots this year. Grrr

true,whistleflute,null,null,"Yes, I think a lot of people who downvoted me were thinking that I thought Spurs were aiming to be a small club. I don't doubt we're trying to evolve, but it's foolish to say we're there yet. All the signs are encouraging, and hopefully this season is another step forward with a coach who is here to stay, but let's wait until the end of the season before we get ahead of ourselves. Some people act like they've never seen a Tottenham side collapse late season before :-)

Again, I don't think Spurs this season are a one-man team, but I say we are **currently playing** like one. In our last three games everyone bar Bale has 'put in a shift', but none of them (except perhaps Holtby for periods) has looked anything special. In fact all of Bale's goals were assisted by him-self: two break aways from the halfway line and a free-kick. Dembele has been a tremendous boost in midfield (his athleticism is undisputed), but since coming back from his injury his offensive input has drastically diminished.

All of our players have the potential to be great on their day: it's just a matter of that coming a bit more regularly. Lennon's dropped off since Man Utd, Walker is still struggling, BAE is in and out of the team, likewise Vertongen, before he got injured Defoe hadn't scored in 10 games, Dempsey has mis-fired - it's easy to see *why* the media would call us a one man team.

The advantage is that there's no lock-in, so when your four months are up, just use all your credit and toss the card out of the plane window as you leave.  The disadvantage is that you'll pay through the nose for calls, SMS and especially data.

Option 2 would be to go for a contract like 3's One Plan.  You don't have to sign up for a period of time, and can cancel whenever you want.  The benefit is that you'll get much cheaper calls and SMS and potentially unlimited data depending on provider and contract chosen.  The downside is that you'll still have to pass all their pre-contract checks, which *may* include a credit check (although I'm sure someone can clarify whether this is the case for rolling contracts).
