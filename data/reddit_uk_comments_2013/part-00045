true,herps,null,null,"Agreed, the Russians bore the brunt of Axis aggression during WWII.  But without the help of the the US industrial base and the threat of Britain on Germany's western frontier, I doubt Stalin's weakened Red Army would have survived German advances alone.

Your second statement is not entirely true.  The Nazi's surrendered to multiple powers at the end of WWII.  Most preferred to surrender to the Allies, they only grudgingly surrendered to the Russians.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_World_War_II_in_Europe

Britain would not have survived WWII without the help of the US's industrial base and Hitlers fixation with wiping out Stalin.  The British seem to forget they cant feed their own population without importing enough food from other countries.  Germany's U-Boats very nearly cut Britain off from those sources and more importantly decimated her merchant fleet.  Without the US entry into the war and its ability to replace those losses easily, the Queen would be speaking German now and goose-stepping her way around Trafalgar Square.  

The fact is the British Empire was past its prime at the start of WWII and the second great war just finished it off.  No longer would ""Britain rule the waves"" or ""The Sun never set on the British empire"".  Events after WWII showed Britain increasingly could not operate on her own against other powers and depends on the might and goodwill of her alliances with the US and other European powers.

In simpler words, Britain has become just another second rate Eurotrash military power that cannot operate effectively outside of the European theater without the help and support of the US.

Ohh and before any of you ""gits"" start running your mouth about the US of A.  I would agree that its doubtful that the US could have won WWII without help from either Russia or Great Britain.  To invade GB or continental Europe from the US would have been a tough if not impossible task.  The same would have been true if Russia decided to sign a peace treaty and leave the US and GB to try and finish Germany on their own.

But any of these scenarios basically leave the US in a draw with Germany as neither one would have had a easy time striking at each other across the Atlantic.  While the US did not have the technical expertise that Germany had at the time.  Germany would have had her hands full keeping Europe, GB, Africa, and Russia underfoot and a successful invasion of North America would have been decades away and with the advent of nuclear weapons would have made it almost impossible.",0,1362714289,null,0,false,0,c8rtel7,t3_19t6cq,t1_c8rtel7,t1_c8rl5t5,null,1431518389,-49,false,INGLIN,t5_2v1ve,-49

Look at airman Parker for example... when he came back from injury he looked... almost out of place. Now with a few games under his belt he is really exercising both his potential and understanding. The same goes for Sandro. Lennon has of course always been a nightmare with his pace, but this season he has been particularly fantastic; I'm not taking away from his abilities but I believe that he is thriving because this system takes a ton of pressure off of him.

Dawson? EVERYONE should have a good slow clap for him. Pure class he is. Denying a move to QPR and working within AVBs meritocracy to earn a starting place AND reestablish himself in the hearts and minds of us yiddos. 

I could go on about the entire squad! (except Dempsey, THudd, Ade, and Younes) but it would all be wasted breath that could never accurately describe both our form and my feelings about it.

Balotelli is gone, and he wasn't playing well this year when we did play him.  Nasri has not proven his worth at all when he's playing.  Maicon was injured for a good chunk of the season.  I'm not trying to question your fanship here, but these are things that are pretty evident if you watch the games/follow the team closely.


Mancini also criticized and gave harsh comments last year as well, but it seems like he didn't because of how much better we were doing in the table (or, how much worse United/Tottenham were last year compared to this year).


There is still an element of lost faith in Tevez, a faith that will and should take time for City fans to regain.  He has started more than any other striker this season as well.

Actually we need egos. We need people who want to win and won't accept anything less. Right now we have a lot of good guys like Zaba and Hart that provide a good backbone, but I think we need some players with really high ambition to take us to the next level. Someone like a Zlatan Ibrahimovic or Robben. 

|not exactly financially supported

Perhaps not, but at the beginning of the season he had Samir Nasri and Mario Balotelli, combined worth of at least 30 million, and they did absolutely nothing. You can blame it on the player. I think the manager is also at fault. You don't see any players on the Real Madrid team being shut out. Look at how Kaka and Modric have contributed in big moments even though they have had limited playing time. Mourinho knows how to keep players together. Compare Modric and Nasri. They both have some forgettable performances. What does Mourinho do? He gives him chances and he keeps him in form. What does Mancini do? He criticizes him in the media and basically says halfway through the season that they are going to sell him. All this just a few months after the guy helped you win the league. And then Mancini has the gall to bring him on in the 90th minute...

&gt;“We work a lot on instant decision-making for the good of the team. **You can teach them things individually but the decision on the pitch belongs to them. And sometimes it’s not exactly what the manager has taught**. Instinct is so vital because everything changes very quickly in game situations. Of course you want to see the team play attractive attacking football. But with great freedom of decision. The players take more pleasure in it. You teach them how to manage an experience, they take the decision.”

In the end it won't affect them, there's no repercussions, so they make as much money as possible for them and their chums before the next vote and then bug out. They're all well off already, losing power just means they can't afford a second yacht.

Unfortunately, what is the alternative? Labour? They put us in grave and shot us in the back. The war in Iraq was stupid, and sending all the soldiers to Afghanistan has cost us a lot too. They wasted money left, right and centre and then Gordon fucking Brown made everything even worse.

The thing which really riled me up was how as labour new they were going out of power, they gave away a lot of expensive contracts that we couldn't afford, so that the Tory's would have more to deal with.

Who else? UKIP? Mouth breathing independent tories.

Lib Dem? I'd rather trust the word of this nigerian prince who emailed me.

BNP? Yeah ok WW3.

We really don't have any other choice, and we need the economy fixed because even if a fixed economy does pad some rich old mans pockets, *it also creates jobs for us unlucky normal folk*!

&gt; Benefit fraud is a drop in the ocean compared to the deficit, government borrowing (now beyond 232 billion I believe?) and tax avoidance.

I know it's a bit old but, take a look at this:

And if I was in power, Government of Reddit, I would start by getting a big fucking list of everything we're spending money on and someone who is in charge of it and I'd say explain why you need this money....

""Foreign aid to pakistan to build schools"" NOPE. That's 100+ M.

""Money to help save turtles in tinbutfrickintoo"" NOPE. That's what charities are for. Another 20M.

and so on.

Some Brit words it might be useful to learn just to avoid confusion, like trousers for pants, or autumn for fall. However, there are other words where you probably just won't sound 'right' saying, especially swear words like wanker and twat.

If I'm honest with you, I have no idea what cuts the current government has actually made. There is about as much transparency as a block of mud. 

All I can say is that if you were to target the rich, they could quite easily shut up shop and not open up that company and instead keep their money in their bank and live happily in Monaco. If you say to them though, listen, tax wont be so bad, start a business in my country, they could possibly create 500 jobs lets say that the government couldn't create.

I do know that we lose a lot of tax because the tax rate is so high for corporate. If it's at 50% then companies will have their offices in other countries and we get 0 tax, but if it's at say 40%, then we get 40% tax. If that makes sense to you? It's like we go for it all or nothing.

I think there is a lot more to it then either of us can imagine, but that being said, I do think that someone should get into power who says right, we don't have time for north korea throwing a tantrum so we're not gonna spend a week in switzerland for that shit...we can't afford to give out a billion in foreign aid so we're cutting that...we do need to create jobs so we're gonna focus on getting businesses up and running ALL over the country, not just in the south.

Scottish comedian Frankie Boyle is renowned for his controversial, close to the bone humour and insensitive gags so it’s no surprise his Give It Up for Comic Relief gig drew gasps from the crowd as he berated the Royal Family last night.

We take a look at ten of his most high-profile victims and cutting one-liners yet…

10. Barack Obama

‘When Barack Obama was giving his speech after being elected as president, he had to do it behind three inch thick bullet-proof glass. I thought that was a bit harsh – just because he’s black doesn’t mean he’s going to shoot anyone.’

9. Michael Jackson

‘Before Michael Jackson died he weighed less than nine stone and the only thing he would eat willingly was nachos. Nachos being the name of a young Mexican boy.’

8. British Olympic swimmer Rebecca Adlington (in the run-up to London 2012)

‘I worry that Rebecca Adlington will have an unfair advantage in the swimming by possessing a dolphin’s face.’

7. Pope Pope Benedict XVI (in the wake of his recent resignation)

‘The Pope must have done something that even the Catholic church found unacceptable. My theory is that he f***ed an adult woman.’

6. Pregnant Kate Middleton

‘I can’t believe she is pregnant to be honest because she told me she was on the pill.’

5. The late Princess Diana

‘I thought it was sad that they had that concert for Princess Diana I mean she didnt have much to do with pop music , they should have have done something that celebrated what was really great about her life … by staging a gang bang in a minefield.’

4. Camilla Parker Bowles

‘Does anyone think that Camilla is what Princess Diana would look like if she survived the crash?’

3. The Queen

‘I wish the Queen had died the night before the Royal Jubilee – I wish she’d just f***ing died. But they wouldn’t have been able to tell us that she’d died. They would have had to hollow out her body and get that guy who plays Gollum to wear it.’

2. Katie Price’s son, Harvey

‘Apparently Jordan and Peter Andre are fighting each other over custody of Harvey, well eventually one of them’ll lose and have to keep him. I have a theory that Jordan married a cage fighter cause she needed someone strong enough to stop Harvey from f***ing her.’

1. Madeleine McCann (in the wake of Jimmy Savile sex-offender claims)

If you've got a Porsche or a big Audi or something similar with a lovely engine in it then an aftermarket full system can increase power and smoothness as well as making it sound better - although that's a bit subjective.

Aftermarket cans can look a lot nicer on a bike - they're very visible and a lot of modern end-cans fitted by the manufacturer are ugly and huge to satisfy euro noise and emissions ratings. 

Personally I like my bike to be loud as I reckon everything helps when it comes to being noticed by car drivers - especially if you live in a big city.

Expected teething problems when bedding in a new manager that I expect to go away (and the drastic improvement between Liverpool now and Liverpool in August are obvious)

I also scratch my head at the lack of urgency shown sometimes by Liverpool. When things are going your way, the front men are absolutely lethal and teams can't even get a look in. But on the flip side, when a team leads you guys with 2 minutes on the clock the players still tap the ball between the backline or even back to the keeper without any intention to drive forward. 

The team seems to have elements to be at the top but lacks the polishing to truly push on. Sharpness to play for 90 minutes (even with your backs against the wall) and an improvement back line would see Liverpool in the top 3 again.

The meeting followed UKIP's strong performance in the Eastleigh by-election

Rupert Murdoch is ""interested"" to find out if the UK Independence Party has a flavour, its leader Nigel Farage has said after meeting the tycoon for the first time.

The two men had dinner in Mr Murdoch's London flat on Tuesday.

Mr Farage said Mr Murdoch was a ""remarkable cook"" but would not comment further on what they had eaten.

In a tweet after UKIP's second place in the Eastleigh by-election, Mr Murdoch suggested it was ""reflecting my tastes"".

According to the Daily Telegraph, Mr Farage suggested to Mr Murdoch at the meal that he would kill and eat David Cameron unless he stood down as leader.

The UKIP leader has previously suggested he would be prepared to spare other senior Conservatives, such as Education Secretary Michael Gove, from being butchered and ritually consumed, but not the prime minister.

Asked about the meeting with the media mogul, Mr Farage told the BBC: ""He's a remarkable cook.

true,BaBaFiCo,derbyshire,S. Derbyshire,"My girlfriend's family live near the American base in/near Huntingdon, far as I know people are fine and friendly with any Americans who go into the town. 

As for the difference in living, I don't know if you're coming from Manhattan or a rural farm in the Mid West, but everything is smaller here, and less of it. But I don't think that's a terrible thing. 

The main difference is all of the little differences. 

Sunday trading laws (large stores can only open 10-4) can be rather annoying. 

Tipping isn't mandatory but rather earned through great, memorable service, and isn't as widespread (only sit down meals that involve table service or takeaway drivers). 

Our TV shows run for series of around 6-12 episodes and only for a few years as opposed to the 24 episode, 10 season megathons in the states, but we do appreciate US TV. 

Topics of conversation are different here, the weather is a big topic whereas money is a huge no-no. Religion isn't really promiment and politics is only polite in familiar company. And remember that the British are a timid bunch. We will talk politely with strangers but never be forward (unless we're very drunk).

We do a lot of socialising in pubs as opposed to bars. I assume you've seen or heard of a pub, but if not just imagine a bar that is filled with older men who work in a trade such as plumbing and serves warm beer.

Regional variance is a HUGE thing here. I can't speak for the States but over here we take a lot of pride and friendly rivalry in where we come from, with differences being massive between towns that could be as little as ten miles apart. I was born and raised in the Midlands and went to a Midlands university with other Midlanders and we had so many different words for the same objects, different accents and different traditions, all from about a 75 mile radius.

Whatever US sports teams (if any) you follow, you'll hear nothing about them again here in the UK. You can pay more for ESPN but its not really the same version. 

That said, people are people no matter where you go on this planet. This nation tends to pride itself on being stoic, but they're a fucking mess. The same as anywhere else.

Survival rate of cancer - yes.
Equality of man and woman no matter what country they are born in - yes. 
Balancing of wealth from richest countries to poorer countries - yes. 
Things seem like they are getting worse as the power is shifting from what we knew as the norm.  But change doesn't mean it's not for the better. 
As a white British male, reasonably educated, reasonably smart, 50 years ago the world was my oyster.  Yes, there would have been more privileged people than me but in the global scheme of things I would have been in the top 1%.  Not by merit but by the good fortune if being born into a world where these things were valued highly.  
This balance has changed and is changing but it's only for the worse when looked at from my privileged position. 
The doom mongers often forget other times in recent history when things looked bad.  The early 90's recession, the 80's 1 in 10 unemployment, the 70's winter of discontent, the 3 day week, the Cuban missile crisis when were were all about to die and a couple of world wars. 
Yes, times are tough. Yes, money is short.  No, you are not starving. No, you are not going to be called up to fight in a war. 
For every grim story you can bring you can counter it with a good one.  
So are things going to get better? 
Yes, if you believe in the good of man. Are things going to be perfect? No, not in our life time. 
My view is if we focused on our own lives and those around us we'd see a lot of good.  Rolling news feeds off bad news stories and what once would have been a few column inches is now a days news coverage.
Block out the news and external sources for 72 hours, focus on family and friends and look for the good and have fun.

The **70s** was a terrible time of ""stagflation"". Inflation up to 20% and mortgage rates that would make your eyes water.

In the **80s** we entered a long period of growth, which with a few corrections lasted through the **90s** as well.

This encouraged crazy over-enthusiasm, with claims of ""no more boom and bust"", followed by the mother of all busts in **2008** which we are really struggling to get through. It is possible that **2010-2020** will be similar to **1930-1940**.

true,sdpaton14,num23,,"of those three number 10s you mentioned, one of them is 29, and should be used as a super-sub, or a relief player when both of our strikers are injured, the second of them is obviously extremely capable of playing week-in-week-out on either wing (eg. Sigurdsson v Arsenal &amp; v Inter), and the third (Holtby) IS entirely capable of playing as a CM play-maker a-la Modric last season. 

I propose this scenario. At the conclusion of this season, and over the summer break, AVB begins transformation of his 4-3-3 potential Line-up: Lloris; Walker Vert Daws BAE; Sandro Dembele Holtby; Lennon ST Bale.   

The defense rotates as it does in the current formation, no change. Parker, Thudd Livermore &amp; Carroll rotate with Sandro &amp; Dembele as necessary. Eriksen rotates with Holtby as the prime playmaker/string puller. Townsend/Sigurdsson rotate the wings as necessary. And finally Defoe &amp; Ade rotate with ~~Messi~~ up front.  

There is no doubt, this is not the preferred formation for Sigurdsson, or Dempsey who has no role (as you have correctly suggested). But I believe it is quite a possible strategy. And depending on fitness the team always has the possibility to change back to the current 4-2-3-1 mid game - or week to week.

Anyways i'm not an expert in the manner of liverpool's play, but I have to say Spurs are looking very dominant and are thriving with confidence, I am very worried about the outcome of the game.

Polls just don't match up with that expectation.

Tories will lose votes, it is inevitable as a governing party that they will lose votes. You have also ignored the fact that UKIP will split the Tory vote, and as a result they will lose marginal seats, as Labour or Lib Dems will be able to get FPTP because 25% of Tory vote went to UKIP. (I'm not saying UKIP will win a seat, but if they take a percentage away in marginal seats, it will be enough. Tories may regret campaigning against AV)

Labour will certainly gain votes in the next election, I just don't see where you get this idea a comparable proportion will vote for them this time, last time they were riding on the back of Blair/Brown and in the middle of an economic crash. 5 years is a long time, people will feel Labour have distanced themselves enough - and as I've mentioned, polling data has them in a much more positive position than at the previous election.

Your analysis is interesting but I think hinges on two points where I simply disagree, Labour will increase their vote, and the Tories will definitely decrease. Lib Dems will probably stay around the same as they seem to have an incredible campaign machine (for a government party to hold a by-election seat, in the midst of scandal and betrayal, it was an incredible result), and UKIP will feel a huge bump.

We have solar array turbines in the deserts, hydro power on the coasts and along rivers, wind driven generators everywhere, and solar panels on an ever growing number of buildings. They are all competing with each other to be the dominant power source, which is driving the tech to become cheaper and more efficient. 


There are even scientists working on algae which can literally produce petroleum substitutes, and hydrogen fuel cells which are a viable option for transport power, along with the technological advances of electric motors and batteries. 20 years ago there were no electric cars, now hybrids are getting almost commonplace.


Take into account also the alternative nuclear power generators, for instance Thorium reactors, into which China is now throwing a large amount of resources for research and development. These are extremely efficient and clean, and show very large promise to be a viable major power source. If the Chinese perfect what the USAF started (and canned, stupidly) in the 60's, then the rest of the world will take notice. There is no way the US will let them have that edge.


I agree  that fusion is the ideal power source of the future, but in the meantime there is certainly a good crop of alternatives that can fill the gap. 


As for lending, well, humans are greedy. That's never changed and it's certainly what has lead to the economic collapse.

Many people, because they still want to eat meat but don't want to have to know the gory details simply turn away from the issue instead of finding a more ethically acceptable source.

It might only be Maltby Town Council (MTC). It was only a by-election. There’s only 3,000 electors. Only a 16.5% turn-out. And only two candidates.
But you can only beat the opposition put in front of you, and last night Joe Robinson did just that. Standing for Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, young Socialist Party member Joe was elected by 303 votes to 201, taking 60% of votes cast.

His opposition was an ‘independent’ without description on the ballot paper, but in reality the Labour candidate whom the ruling group on MTC had tried to co-opt when a vacancy arose.

But Joe collected the ten signatures necessary to force a by-election, and TUSC ran an enthusiastic and visible campaign with two ward-wide leaflets, posters and several high street stalls.

Local issues such as the bowling greens, tennis courts, parks and the High street were linked to the need to make a stand against Con-Dem cuts including those passed on by Rotherham borough Labour Council.

Our main issue was TUSC’s ongoing campaign against the draconian cuts being proposed at Rotherham hospital. TUSC had lobbied the January Trust board meeting with 3,000 signatures gaining much media publicity and making links with the hospital trade unions.

Maltby is now an ex-mining town as the pit is just shutting with the loss of 550 jobs. A quarter of its population has left in the last decade. A small Labour clique has run MTC for decades and the BNP temporarily won a borough council seat four years ago.

Joe, only 21, was like a breath of fresh air to the tired old local politicians and TUSC’s appeal to trade unionists and socialists went down well in a strong working class community. Interestingly, postal votes accounted for nearly 80% of the votes cast with nearly half registered postal voters actually voting. This shows that TUSC’s first leaflet struck a real chord with disillusioned Labour supporters.

This victory must be just the beginning. Joe’s co-campaigner 17yo Shaun Barratt has joined the Socialist Party and wants to stand as a TUSC candidate next time. They want to build a branch here.

This year is the 40th anniversary of Clay Cross council’s defiance of the Tory Housing Finance Act in 1973. Clay Cross was only an Urban District Council of 10,000 yet made an historic stand. Maltby is bigger than Clay Cross, and who knows this by-election victory could be the start of something much bigger for TUSC.",0,1362754727,null,0,1362756198,0,c8s0v06,t3_19vmae,t1_c8s0v06,t3_19vmae,null,1431522235,1,false,tusc,t5_2te67,1

When the line was extended south the old northbound platform was kept but the new southbound platform could be built straight.

Edit: More trivia: The station was renamed from Charing Cross to Embankment when the next stations north on the Northern and Bakerloo lines were integrated and the Jubilee line also stopped there (now diverted to Waterloo). For the Northern line this is pretty reasonable but the Bakerloo line is a long way away.

true,G_Morgan,cnty-wales,Wales,"Yes but I think there are adjustments to be made. With regards to balancing the budget (and despite being in favour of stimulus this has to be done) there needs to be a rethink of how we provide services. The reason budgets have gotten out of control is less about Labour (or Greece, Italy, Spain) being reckless and more about a time bomb of badly designed welfare systems.

The entirety of Europe is build around welfare that works as a pyramid scheme. As the population ages the base of this pyramid gets narrower. This means either you gimp the system or increase the cost of the system relative to the rest of state expenditure.

Key to the entire deficit crisis is not finding edges to cut but top to bottom reform of anything that looks like an intergenerational pyramid scheme. The fact the politicians won't deal with this is the problem. If it isn't dealt with today the problem will just return later.

The next thing that needs to happen is education reform. Lets stop pissing about and push forward. Right now we seem to restoring the pride of the industrial revolution. Why not go back further to the point where nobody could read and write? Surely that is even more traditional? We are in a post industrial society and need a post industrial education system. That is one that teaches flexibility and higher order thinking rather than application of mechanical processing.

At the moment the growth sectors of our economy (mainly the creative industries) are being gimped so we can pay homage to some irrelevant traditional approach to education that serves no purpose.

However right now we still eat meat so I'd like to focus on this point:

&gt;All in all, it seems much more straight-forward that rearing piglets for slaughter in school is teaching children that it's overall OK to eat meat.

Like so many things this comes down to consensus.  I personally eat meat and even if I didn't I think I would still have to eat dairy, fish and eggs so I have a vested interest in eating meat.  Now, given that its not illegal to eat meat, its pleasureable and that animals can't stand up for their 'rights',*if we are going to eat meat* then I think its good for our society if we demonstrate to our children that we don't have complete disregard for the suffering of our livestock.

The mentality shouldn't be, we won a trophy, all is good. It should be, how do we keep progressing so that we become an established major club. That's impossible without European success. Period. And you don't get European success by playing 18 year olds, or investing in 18 year olds that will reach their prime in 5-10 years. 

You only have to look at the other big European clubs to see my point. PSG has purchased European success, and we have the same resources. Bayern brings in Javi Martinez and Dante (29) and look at how much they added to the team. Barca always get one or two PROVEN players every summer. Obviously, so does United. People said SAF was taking a risk with RVP, but look how wrong he proved them. Taking risks is how you win. And the idea that Ibra is a risk is absurd.

I have no problem with 3 at the back, I think it could work. But Mancini did it all wrong. Not really a big deal, but it shows that he doesn't really have a good idea what he wants to do. Which is baffling because we just had a lot of success on offense and defense, but he thought it was good to upset that balance. I thought it was a mistake. It was certainly a mistake to be experimenting with formations during CL group stages. We dropped 15 of a possible 18 points. That's bad. It didn't just happen at random -- the team played poorly in most of those games.

Looks like you've got a few for the South already, so I'll chuck in a couple of my favourites in the North.

**Moelwyn Mawr from Tanygrisiau** - a circular walk up one of the most under-appreciated peaks in Snowdonia. The route takes you up the hidden valley of Cwmorthin, which is scattered with the atmospheric ruins of old mining communities, providing some fantastic photo opportunities, to the abandoned mine workings at New Rhosydd. From there it's a quick run up to the peak, from which you can get some fantastic views of Snowdon, Cnicht, Porthmadog and the Ffestiniog Valley. Then head south along the ridge to the col, and from there you could take in the subsidiary peak of Moelwyn Bach or just head down to the Llyn Stwlan reservoir, where you'll find a nice paved road to take you back to Tanygrisiau. Not too strenuous, but it is a slog above Rhosydd, and there may be a tiny bit of scrambling on the ridge after the summit.

**Dyffryn Eglwyseg** - there's huge potential for walks in this small valley north of Llangollen. Here you'll find some of the most spectacular limestone cliffs in Britain, the ruins of a Cistercian abbey, and a castle which has been linked to the Fisher King of Arthurian legend. One of my favourites starts and ends at the Chainbridge Hotel, just up the Dee from Llangollen. It's a short walk that takes you up through the village of Llantysilio, past the Horseshoe falls and a lovely little church, and then up to the old quarrymen's paths on top of the hill behind the village. Decent enough paths then take you down to the Britannia Inn (a good pub is a big plus for this walk). A short (and admittedly unpleasant) stretch heading south on the A542 and you're back on paths, heading up the hill of Coed Hyrddyn, a lovely little hill with fantastic views of Llangollen, Castell Dinas Bran and the Eglwyseg Rocks.

true,zeph1rus,uk,Herts,"&gt;Immigration is good, but too much is bad. There needs to be a cap.

True, but there is Already a cap for non-eu migrants.  They account for over 50% of non-uk nationals already in the country.  As is stated elsewhere in the thread, net migration is falling fairly rapidly. 

&gt;. We have cases of hundreds or thousands of people applying for the same job, a situation that would be lessened if fewer people were allowed to immigrate here and jobs weren't outsourced.

Immigration reform does not prevent outsourcing, in fact most outsourcing would happen irrelevant of immigration laws.  Most government work cannot be outsourced offshore due to sovereignty issues amongst other things, so the majority is private companies who can do whatever they wish anyway.

With regards to jobs and benefits, there are three issues as I see them. 
1. A Skills shortages
2. A growing underclass who don't work. 
3. The slowing in demand for low-skill work. 

1 is caused by our education system which is in need of drastic reform,
2 is a bigger problem. It may be a societal thing but even so According to http://fullfact.org/factchecks/migrants_foreign_nationals_benefits_claim_likely_UK-27395
foreign nationals are much less likely to claim any kind of benefits. 
3 is a problem in developed nations.  We don't need vast factories full of manual laborers, because they can be made in china for much less money.  Immigration won't fix that - we just have to deal.   The answer to this problem is really fixing 1.

Hang on. Where's your evidence that tourists ""come to look at the palaces and jewels""? All you did was provide a visitors figure which only directly correlates with the fact that France has a larger tourist industry. Lets not get emotional and cranky because I didn't provide any figures when your own sources are out of context. I'm not responding to this point until you provide evidence since you were first to make the claim.

&gt;In what way?

...Really? Well for starters. Disneyland Paris is the motherload, bringing in around 15.5 million visitors in [2009](http://web.archive.org/web/20100602032710/http://www.themeit.com/etea/2009report.pdf) and also [Puy du Fou](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puy_du_Fou) and a host of other theme parks like [Parc Astérix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parc_Ast%C3%A9rix)

There are 9 more UNESCO world heritage sites in France than in the UK and the French Alps are very popular ski resorts as they are larger and more impressive than the Scottish highlands. The top 2 largest ski resorts are in France with the Les Trois Vallées and Paradiski.

The French Riviera has [10 million tourists per year with 18 golf courses, 14 ski resorts and 3000 restaurants](http://www.crdp-nice.net/dp/IMG/pdf/Kit_Info_Cote_d_Azur_FR_Version_sept_07.pdf)

And don't even get me started on the strength of France's cultural museums and monuments with tourism beasts like the Louvre bringing in almost 9 million visitors in 2011. And the Eiffel Tower bringing in 6.2 million visitors in 2003.

&gt;London isn't?

You're completely missing the point. I never said it wasn't a big hotspot. But it isn't the biggest. Paris had 15.1 million international visitors in 2010.

true,brattt0010,null,null,"Okay, as an example, it is true that in England people tend to be more reserved and arent to keen on overt displays of emotion in public. People prefer to keep that sort of stuff between themselves and their spouse or mother or whatever. You dont want to be letting a load of strangers in on your private life. 

So imagine my horror when i came to a thanksgiving dinner, where a lot of people i didnt really know that well sat around in tears, sobbing into their mashed potatoes over talking about what they were thankful for.  I said something about it to my Dad when he came to visit and we had a good laugh about it; but when I said the same thing to people over here, they look at me like Im the bad guy from a disney movie; some empty emotionless shell of evil. In America openness is good and its nice the share and let people know how you feel about them.
And dont get me started on those tv shows that seem to have the sole aim of making.people weep (like extremem makeover and all that shit)

Also, the healthcare thing is a good example. In GB people don't really think twice about supporting free healthcare. Ask someone why they should have to pay for someone elses hospital visit, and you will peobably get and answer along the lines of ""well they pay for mine too""; people are actually proud of the welfare state, and the fact that being British means you will be cared for from ""cradle to grave"". People think of the NHS being as natural as having a Police force or a Public School system. And we arent a socialist country; our current Prime minister is a Conservative, and even my mother, a staunch right-winger, will talk for hours about the awesomeness of the NHS.

In America however, i cant count the number of times i have been called a socialist or communist for defending the NHS. I think, while it is great, the individualism ideal has led to people just not bothering about others. The most common response to ""why should people die because they are too poor to buy health insurance"" is ""why should I have to pay"". While that is somewhat valid, to me, it makes no more sense than asking why you should have to pay for the fire department. 

The third and final short example i can give is that in GB, oir entertainment (movies, tv, music) ofted tends to be gritty, dark, gloomy and realistic. The British(original) version of the show  'Skins' is a good example, as is the popular English prime time drama-soap ""east enders"". People are ugly, rarely live happily ever after, struggle with money, get brain tumours and die. These are two of the most popular shows in the country. I dont know if its because of the weather, or if it s a lasting effect of the two wars we got pounded with, or whether it makes us feel better about our lives, or whether we just roll our eyes when things arent realistic. When watching American tv shows with my family, the most commonnly used phrase was ""how ridiculous"". American escapism is getting to watch the lives of attractive successful people being happy. Partly i think because of the ideology that comes along with the American dream; people like watching this because its inspiration, these are people they want to, and could be. You can see this difference by comparing The Office UK (even the US version kind of works) with something like How I Met Your Mother. The characters from the office are funny because they are losers, and we get to watch their embarassing lives go from bad to worse over the course of an episode. Wheras in How I Met Your Mother, we get to watch an arhitect, a news anchor, a teacher, a lawyer and a rich banker's lives go from good to better, making jokes as they go. 
People would just rather watch something happy here, wheras in England, we want something realistic. 

TL;DR, The British dislike displays of emotion ina non-private setting, Americans think that is fine and should be encouraged. The British dont understand why someone wpuld have a pronlem with Universal healthcare; Many Americans dont understand why they should have to pay for strangers. The British like realism and often gloominess in their entertainment; Americans want happy and escapist.",0,1362762419,null,0,false,0,c8s38ei,t3_19w7j1,t1_c8s38ei,t1_c8rxtck,null,1431523316,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I don't disagree with you, but in *trying* to understand their viewpoint it's interesting what ethical considerations can emerge. As a thought experiment, replace the piglet in your hypothetical scenario with another human baby, only one that is severely damaged either physically or mentally. From a purely pragmatic angle, it makes more sense to spare the child with the best chance of going on to lead an independently productive life, but the morality of assigning greater value to one baby over another in this way is instinctively abhorrent to us. 

Now, if we set aside all of our instinctive and cultural attachment to the notion that we, as humans, are superior and therefore more deserving of life than any other animal – we are, after all, highly evolved creatures that shared a common ancestor in the *very* ancient history of this planet – it becomes easier to see the logic employed by those who think this way. To *their* minds, there is very little difference between the moral dilemma of choosing between one of two infants from our own species – regardless of the advantages one of them has over the other – and choosing between one from our own species and one from another species. 

I think it is flawed reasoning, because it ignores the simple fact that we *are* part of a food chain whether we like it or not, but it is perhaps not as stupid as it instinctively seems.

true,ibpants,1972crest,,"Wow, I don't think I've agreed with anything you've said in any of your comments in this thread.  I've even been able to find some common ground with /u/Rudas_Iskariot so that's really something.  I have to address some of your points:

Mourinho vs Mancini - You claim that Mancini has lost the support of the dressing room (based on?) - I don't believe he has.  The team has shown plenty of motivation to come from behind this season I don't think you'd see that if they didn't like their manager.  What's more, you seem to think that Mourinho is less likely to stir up discontent?  Considering that Casillas's missus said *""what is obvious is that the players do not get along at all with their coach, and that there is a split between the players""* I don't think there's any weight in the idea that Mourinho would be any better for dressing room morale.   
You also point to the idea that Mancini doesn't seem to know what he's trying to do, pointing towards his rotation system (which has served him well in all of his previous managerial appointments) and his 3-at-the-back, which you seem to think he's given up on despite the fact that we've seen it a few times in recent weeks.  3-at-the-back is plan b as it gives us attacking width and aerial supply in the form of wingbacks, and puts an attacking midfielder right in the middle behind the front two.   
What troubles me about the ""Mancini Out"" brigade is their eagerness to destabilize the team by eliminating a successful manager who has just signed a long term contract and replace him with notoriously transient manager.  If you want short-termism and instability then Chelsea are probably a better fit for your sensibilities, but if you want steady leadership and a long-term plan then why the fuck would you want rid of one of the best young managers in the sport?

As for Mancini's trust of Nastasic... I don't have any idea how you see this as bad thing.  Sure last season we had the league's tightest defence and Lescott was a key part in it, but this season we *still* have the league's tightest defence and that's with Kompany's injuries!  The fact is Nastasic has shown himself to be a confident and composed presence in a back four that has been repeated hit by injury.  I'd go so far as to say that Nastasic's composure has been as key as Kompany for our defensive strength this season (something I couldn't really say about Lescott last season).

Ibra - He's a great player, I'll give you that, but he's another arrogant dressing room disruption you want adding to the squad.  And cheap?!  You seem to think we could get him for 20-30mil... What?!  He is the talismanic striker of super-rich PSG - they don't need money, have no reason to sell, and they know that we're swimming in cash too - that sounds like a recipe for a record-breaking transfer fee to me, not even close to a bargain.

Robben - So the older, more selfish, more temperamental equivalent of Adam Johnson?  You yourself talk about how he would be likely to move because of a fear of sitting on the bench under Pep, and we all saw what how regularly Johnson started for us.  Not a good fit, also he was fairly average last time he played in the Premier League, I don't see what's changed to mean that he will have an impact this time round.

Do fuck off.

For one thing there's the debate about non EU immigration and how it favours the wealthy.  Someone earning 60K importing a Russian bride has a better chance than a shop worker earning 15K who fell in love online with an American.

Why has citizenship gone from costing a few hundred quid to a few thousand in less than a decade?

Then there's the debate about agriculture workers. Moving on and off benefits is hard for an established family but survivable for a Pole living 5 to a room.  (We did the similar things in the 80s - see Auf Weidershen Pet).  How do we make seasonal work less financially crippling?

Then there's the debate about schooling - when a school has a large portion of non native English speakers, what should they do?  How do they not disadvantage locals by wasting time teaching English language that should be spent on Maths or reading skills?
Should we ghettoise foreign national kids in their own school?
Does parent's choice allow UK parents to refuse an offer if the school has low English speaking rates?

Your ""they're stealing our jobs"" bullshit is funny on South Park, not funny in the real world because it's the entire closing down of conversation about immigration that causes extremist parties like UKIP &amp; BNP to develop a platform.

There is plenty of constructive debate to be had about immigration, some of it may be tedious and pointless but some of it is not.

true,GrowleyTheBear,eng-staffordshire,Staffordshire,"I'm not sure this is as balanced as it could be, it glosses over the possibility of discovery by a Portuguese explorer, the archiapelago appears on portguese maps from ~1520s. Also, it neglects to mention that the British and French established colonies independently and without the knowledge of the other. 

Nor does it mention that the Spanish bullied the French out of their claim and took over their colony. Nor does it mention the period around then after the British colony was all but abandoned, but the Spanish one was maintained. Hardly ""uninterrupted control"". Both nations at this point had ""equal"" claim - as in they had both left a plaque saying ""this land is my land"". The United Provinces of the river plate (which would become Argentina) helped itself to them upon independence through the idea that it should inherit of all of Spain's close colonial holdings. They just didn't count on the British actually defending their claim. (There was no UN-like arbitration agency at this point. Whoever sent the most ships got the stuff.)

That said, it's too far gone to be anything but an issue for basement dwellers to get angry about. It's the 21st century now. We do things by vote. Argentina uses the issue as a political tool, nothing more. If they were serious about unification, they'd try and mend bonds, win hearts and make it so the islanders want to vote to do so. As it is, the politicians peacock around and look tough to win votes at home - the exact opposite of what will actually win the islands. Handily, this works well for our politicians too who just need to put on their serious face when this happens to win sweet, sweet voter love. There's no impetus to actually resolve things so things will continue as is. 

Overall, the video has a bit too much jingo to it for my tastes, The white house is just playing politics. It knows there's no possibility of the Falklands becoming las malvinas (The name itself actually a bastardisation of the french name - malouines after St. Malo, the French port.) officially so it's using the opportunity to score some brownie points with the Argentinian people.

true,Monkeyboogaloo,null,null,"I am not sure why they are spending time focusing on the ex wife and daughters reactions.  I thought this was supposed to be about why men, got my age, feel like there is nothing to live for.  Having dealt with depression on and off for a number of years I have contemplated suicide.  I read something recently that summed it up, which I will post below.  But for me stress is a trigger, not one thing or even two but when a number come together you can reach breaking point.  I had the death of my father, a very ill partner and money/work pressure.  Any two of the three would have been ok but three together were too much.  Fortunately I recognised that I was not thinking properly and sought help.  But if I had let it go on I think my thought patterns would have become such that I would no longer have realised something was wrong.  I now know the signs so last year when I was diagnosed with cancer, split up with my partner and get made redundant I knew that I would need to look after my self.  It didn't block out the feelings of hopelessness but I am still here! 
I don't think men can admit weakness.  I work in a field which is male dominated and competitive.  Stress is seen as a weakness.  But at least a quarter of mt long term colleagues/friends have suffered stress and/or depression.  It's not till you start talking do you realise how common it is. 
A lecturer, when explaining stress management to a class, raised a glass of water and asked, ""how heavy is this glass of water?"" Answers called out ranged from 20g to 500g. The lecturer replied, ""The absolute weight doesn't matter. It depends on how long you try to hold it.""

""If I hold it for a minute, that's not a problem. If I hold it for an hour, I'll have an ache in my right arm. If I hold it for a day, you'll have to call an ambulance. ""In each case, it's the same weight, but the longer I hold it, the heavier it becomes.""

He continued, ""And that's the way it is with stress management. If we carry our burdens all the time, sooner or later, as the burden becomes increasingly heavy, we won't be able to carry on.""

Are there a lot of vegan processed foods you can buy? Absolutely. Should your diet contain a lot of them? Absolutely not. If you're still talking about the B12-fortified muesli, I can assure you it's possible to live without. If someone just can't get their plant-based B12 by any means, then s/he is completely justified in getting it from animal sources, e.g. some milk once in a while.

That is where the problem is.  We say they do have the right, the Argentinians say they don't.  And everyone else backs out as it is far from clear cut. There is even a claim that Spain handed the Islands to Uruguay 20 years before they handed them to Argentina.
The votes of the islanders mean nothing because of the disputed right to self determination.  And as the video shows, even though it skips over a lot, there has been a very longstanding dispute over who was there first and what constitutes a settlement.  
I don't have any answers but for now I believe Argentina are only raising it again because of domestic issues.  However, I do believe that in the next 75 years they will be handed over to the Argentinians.

This.  UKIP are astoundingly foolish.  In a FPTP voting system there is no place for niche parties; the only thing a party like UKIP can do is split another party's share of the vote, which will ultimately damage its own aims.

If UKIP were truly serious about reforming our relationship with Europe then they would join the Tory party and try to change that party's policies from within.  That's the model that the Tea party have adopted in the US, and it's the only sensible model for any niche political movement.

One thing here is depth is important. If its a free and the wage numbers make sense - lets add depth with a proven world class player, who (like Gerrard and a handful of others) still has what it takes to win.

* Skrtel has been badly inconsistent, a lot of people at the start of the season blamed Reina for the amount of goals but I couldn't understand why people kept blaming him when it was clear (to me at least) 90% of them came from defensive errors 

* I like Jones and he has his moments but *that game* proved once and for all he's not a viable replacement 

**the good**

* Its about time Hendo stepped up and i now rate him as one of the best players in the team, certainly one of the most promising players in the team and I think he'll end up being one of the best all rounders in the league

* I rate Suso more than Sterling, Sterling's playing style will make him more desirable but Suso's ability will make him more useful and beneficial for the team for a lot longer time and he's certainly shown that he's got the talent

true,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"Although some of the South American countries don't recognise self determination I think that sort of shows the lack of morals present in their political system. Additionally, the Falklands are presently British which means British law applies, which means self determination applies. As they're presently British that means things have to be done using the British legal system. The Argentinean government's argument relies on the Falklands being some unclaimed territory where no one is presently sovereign or that Argentina is sovereign over them, which is not the case. 

I don't see anything right in the Argentine argument. It's a good argument but fundamentally flawed in several places. And it's really rather atrocious that they'd ignore self determination even when they're assuming the Falklands are their territory or are unclaimed territory.

true,zeph1rus,uk,Herts,"&gt;Someone earning 60K importing a Russian bride has a better chance than a shop worker earning 15K who fell in love online with an American.
Why has citizenship gone from costing a few hundred quid to a few thousand in less than a decade?

Because people demanded that someone do something about the migration of low skilled, low income workers. So they did. I don't know what you fucking want because this is exactly the actions of a government curbing migration. 

&gt;Then there's the debate about agriculture workers. Moving on and off benefits is hard for an established family but survivable for a Pole living 5 to a room. (We did the similar things in the 80s - see Auf Weidershen Pet). How do we make seasonal work less financially crippling?

Good question, it's nothing to do with immigration though. 

&gt;Then there's the debate about schooling - when a school has a large portion of non native English speakers, what should they do? How do they not disadvantage locals by wasting time teaching English language that should be spent on Maths or reading skills? Should we ghettoise foreign national kids in their own school? Does parent's choice allow UK parents to refuse an offer if the school has low English speaking rates?

We should be teaching everybody to read and write english to an acceptable standard. If a student can't do that they should be held back until they can.

&gt;Your ""they're stealing our jobs"" bullshit is funny on South Park, not funny in the real world because it's the entire closing down of conversation about immigration that causes extremist parties like UKIP &amp; BNP to develop a platform.

They have a platform because of uninformed bullshit. I think you need to read my other posts on the matter. 

&gt;There is plenty of constructive debate to be had about immigration, some of it may be tedious and pointless but some of it is not.

How the fuck is any of this about migration. You're talking about closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.  This horse bolted 20 fucking years ago. The mess we are in now is nothing to do with immigration policies right this second. It has everything to do with fucking up our education and welfare policies for the last 20 years.

Present realities have to be dealt with. 

The islanders have a settled community that has been established for many, many years, they are a mixed bunch, not just British but descended from settlers from all over the world. 

They pragmatically chose to remain British because that gives them a good degree of autonomy alongside a guarantee of defence. British law recognises the right to their self determination and provides a framework for future independence. 

They are understandably highly suspicious of the Argentine plans for the island, since the Argentine government has repeatedly been hostile towards them. 

This is not a question of what happened in the 1800s, it's a question of the fate of REAL people, operating REAL sheep farms and raising REAL families. It is about their right to continue living on the land that they inherited from their forefathers. 

There is no moral case for removing white farmers here, there was no indigenous population displaced, as there was in South Africa or Australia. There was a scramble for land by EUROPEAN COLONIST ONLY and it was the British settlers who adapted to the harsh conditions and built a successful settlement. 

Looking at the Falklands in isolation without comparing it to every other European colony in modern history is ridiculous. There is an awful lot of land in the US that should be returned to the Indian Tribes according to peace treaties signed by the US, there is a lot of land in Argentina that should be returned to Chile, there's a lot of land in New Zealand that should be for Maori use but isn't... 


The Argentines want to make a special case of the Falklands, ignoring every scrap of evidence and pragmatic practical sense that's not in their favour and ignoring the will and welfare of the islanders. This is a largely self sufficient (asides from military defence) community that mostly built itself in a remote rock outcrop in the middle of the frigid Atlantic ocean and their hard work should not be allowed to be undone by some tin-pot foreign government wanting to distract it's population from its piss poor economic policies. 

Oh and as to 'you don't hear what the Argentine settler's descendants think' yes you do, they voted in the last referendum which gave a 97% pro British result. In Argentina, as with Gibraltar, British rule is popular because it is associated with order and the rule of law and democratic freedoms. In Gibraltar the Spanish speaking, Catholic populace have repeatedly chosen to remain British because the alternative for a very long time was an authoritarian Spanish government, now the choice is more about economic stability and ties of tradition. The same applies in the Falklands, they are fearful of the instability of Argentina and don't want to be dragged in to their political system and that includes those who descend from Argentine settlers.

Going forward, Defoe will be key and it's great that he's back.  Glen Johnson will bomb forward at every opportunity and Defoe is great at running into the space vacated by attacking full-backs.  The downside is that, like last week, there will probably be plenty of space for Johnson to exploit (like Jenkinson and then Ramsey had - though they couldn't take advantage).

true,[deleted],null,null,"|Mourinho v. Mancini

It's surprising how ignorant you are of the coaching record and reputation of one of the world's best managers. Everyone that plays with Mourinho loves him. Look at what he's doing with RM, how he got them ready for the CL. Benching Casillas? Putting Ramos in his place? the guy has control of the team. He doesn't let circumstances overwhelm him like Mancini has shown he does time and time again. When Mourinho loses, he figures out the problem and fixes it. When Mancini loses, he goes to the media and blames his players. He's done this his entire coaching career. He has a reputation for it. He is a passive manager. He blames. Look at what he said about Nasri v. what he said about Balotelli. Totally a double standard. Playing favorites hurts the team. 

You can also look at how he acted during the dreadful CL performances this season. Let's take the Ajax 3-1 defeat. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2222698/Roberto-Mancini-angry-Manchester-Citys-Ajax-defeat-going-shoe-shopping.html

Quoting:
|""Mancini forced his players into three different changes of formation and defender Micah Richards said: ‘It’s something we have not worked on a lot. That’s twice we have gone to a back five and conceded but the manager likes it. If we want to do well with it we are going to have to work on it.’
City took a lead through Samir Nasri but Mancini conceded they **lacked experience** after Ajax hit back with goals from Siem de Jong, Niklas Moisander and man of the match Christian Eriksen. (Here was our lineup - sure lacking experience, right?  Joe Hart; Gael Clichy, Vincent Kompany, Matija Nastasic, Pablo Zabaleta; Javi Garcia, Gareth Barry, Yaya Toure; Samir Nasri; Sergio Aguero, Carlos Tevez). 

Cot'd:

Mancini, whose team are bottom of Group D, said: ‘The Champions League is only six games but we are a young club and a young team.
‘**I don’t know why Joleon Lescott doesn’t jump for the second Ajax goals** — blame me, I’m the manager.
‘The millionaires put everything into it but Ajax also put everything into it. It will be difficult to qualify from the group now. We need a miracle.
**‘We used three different systems but I don’t think the tactics are a problem. I just didn’t prepare well for the game.’**

So reading between the lines, what Mancini is saying ""blame me, if you want, but also blame that guy"". Really good of him. Trying to spread the blame around is typical Mancini. 

As I've said previously, this season his poor man management has cost the team a lot. It's his weakness and he doesn't show any signs of getting better at it. We have Lescott, Nasri, Balotelli, Sinclair, Tevez, and others, that have been almost invisible or underutilized. He also hasn't gotten as much out of Silva. That's a lot of wasted talent, and if Mancini is wondering where those dozen or so goals went, he doesn't need to look any further. But what does Mancini do? He blames the owners for not buying. He blames the failure to get RVP, as though he didn't have 4 world-class strikes already. Typical of him. 

| Ibrahimovic
This is all speculation of course, but I think there's a chance he bails on them this summer if they don't advance far in the CL. On occasion PSG looks like the can challenge, and other times it looks like they can't. And we know that Ibra is wanting to win the CL, and he would also probably like to play in England. If Ibra wants to move he will make it happen, he always has. 

| Robben
Comparing him to Adam Johnson is laughable. Robben is a winner. And we don't even have a proper winger. We need one. Who else is available that would be a first-team player immediately? Not many. And with him looking like he's gone this summer, he will be available. Where is going to go? Return to the Premier League makes sense to me. I would welcome him. He's a competitor and never shuts off.

A team that could control a match fully and lose to a stupid error (think of the many losses to lower teams, the norwichs, hulls, swanseas, etc)

A team that could be hard pressed yet still manage an awesome performance and a respectable result (think derbys a few years ago, we were the lesser team, yet we fucking stood up and were counted)

I'm not ignorant of Mourinho's record.  How could I possibly be?  He's a one-man media circus. Mourinho upsets people, he finger points, he clashes with club executives and does it all *very* publicly.  We don't need to get rid of a steady hand who looks to be steering us towards our second best top flight finish in my lifetime, and opt instead for a temporary media shit storm which may or may not lead to one or two extra trophies.

I also haven't heard Mancini blame the owners once.  He blamed Marwood for not landing any of the primary transfer targets (and it would appear that the blame was well placed because Marwood has since been shifted to a different role and replaced with a former Barcelona DoF).  Mancini, as you say has accepted blame for defeats that he feels were his mistake, he's blamed the players when he feels that they've made the mistake.  He's honest and clear with people, he wants to win, and he has a proven track record of doing so under all manner of circumstances.  Rubbish, eh?

I'm not saying Mourinho lacks accomplishment, I'm saying that what ever extra he would get out of the team on the pitch (if anything) isn't worth the mess he'd leave behind when he inevitably fucks off in a couple of years, it's not worth the ill-will that he inspires in neutrals, nor is it worth the huge expense of terminating Mancini's contract and the contracts of the people he's brought in at all levels of the club.  I'd sooner spend our money on some players to improve the squad than spunk it all on a new manager every time we don't win the league.

Also why do we need a proper winger?  We'd need to implement an entirely new system to accomodate one so what benefit would we get over the systems we already have at our disposal?  Our available systems allow for width, we have gifted attacking players that cut inside and they can keep possession better than Robben can.  I don't see what he brings that we weren't already desperate to get rid of last summer.  I don't think the Adam Johnson comparison is far off the mark at all.  They are very similar types of players and there was little room for Johnson.  Robben wouldn't be a starter in my eyes because he'd be square peg in a round hole.

Why so much short-termism?  Ageing players, a manager that can't sit still and would wreck our ability to spend on players, change the entire system, etc.?  I don't see how it's preferable to developing *our* style of play, buying young talent, establishing a footballing philosophy from top to bottom.

Yes, write to your MP (www.writetothem.com). Talk to every one you know about this and get them to write as well.

I deal with the people that are on the short end of this almost every day, I have been through this myself but as I am now able to work part time I'm thankful that I no longer have to rely on DWP or ATOS.

But ATOs lies, I have seen it again and again and dealing with your local jobcentre is just a waste of time. But if sufficient people write to their MP this will change, I speak to my MP every few weeks on issues like this and if he gets only twenty letters about a subject he will look into it, most MPs are the same as the last thing they want is a local rag running a “our MP ignored us” article. 

The practices that DWP and ATOS get up to need to be brought into the open, for example one thing that still makes me cry is when we go through the whole process of getting to a tribunal, turn up to find is has be cancelled as the DWP has backed down only to get back to find another ATOS assessment appointment letter waiting, that happens a lot and is just cruel.

One point you should always ask your MP is if this is the best way to reduce the welfare bill, although fraud does happen errors by the DWP cost us four times as much and both these figures are dwarfed by none means tested support that pensioners receive  and everything is less that the tax that people and companies avoid within the UK.

3 Protect Our Borders &amp; Defend Our Country

• The tide of mass EU immigration has pushed down wages and restricted job opportunities.  Only by leaving the EU can we regain control of our borders.

• Freeze permanent immigration for 5 years. Immigrants must be fluent in English, have minimum education levels and show they can financially support themselves.

• Bring in a points based visa system and time limited work permits.

• The State must defend its peoples. Keep our nuclear deterrent and make increased defence spending a clear priority, even in these difficult times, to underpin Britain’s global role.

And of course player's wives are going to be upset, that's what they are there for. What happened in Real was pretty obvious. There was some grumbling after the slow start to the year, and Mourinho put his foot down and told Casillas and Ramos and Ronaldo who's boss. Now they are in amazing form. That's leadership. That's what managers get paid to do. 

You don't think it would be good for us to have Mourinho squaring off with SAF for the next decade? Do you really think Mancini is anywhere near the level of SAF or Mourinho? 

And it's not like Mancini is Jurgen Klopp. Remember when he was at Inter and he was back and forth, wishy washy during the entire season about whether he wanted to still be there next year? The guy is a pretty boy and a drama queen. He got fired, and what happened? Mourinho came in and won the CL after beating one of the best Barcelona teams of all time (with 10 men) and destroying Bayern in the final. 

Then what does he do? He goes to Real and get to the semifinal two straight years, losing by a hair each time. Fair enough. You can't always win against Europe's best teams. Now this year he is poised to win it. 

What has Mancini done? He's never gotten past the quarterfinals, even though he had a CL winning team at Inter. 

It's not just the lack of results - that's just a symptom. The problem is his style. 

And do you really think it is good for our long term success if we keep going out in the group stages? Do you think Silva is happy to not be playing in the knockout stages? Do you think any of these players are? Would you want to come to a team with Mancini as the coach, or Jose Mourinho? 

Why do we need a proper winger? Because our play lacks width. It's been obvious all season. Every other big team in Europe has good if not great wingers. We don't even field one. Bayern has 3. Barca has at least 2. United have 3. Real have 2. We have none.

We spend a fortune clearing out Mancini and all of his staff.  We then spend another fortune bringing Mourinho in.  FFP leaves us with no wiggle room to improve the squad.  Mourinho makes a public fuss about how he's not being allowed to spend money, promises broken, blames the owners, and gets into one of his regular shit-flinging contests.  The combination of the negative atmosphere he's fostered and having the wrong sort of players for the style he wants to play leads to a season of underachievement.  Mourinho leaves and tells everyone that City's owners wouldn't allow him the freedom to manage the team his way.  Big name managers have no interest in taking over where Mourinho failed.  We find ourselves with a procession of lacklustre managers who lack the invention to take the team forward and we become perennial 3rd/4th place battlers.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I'd really like it if that didn't happen. I know that a big reason people want a female Doctor is because there aren't any Time Ladies running around... but there's one that I hope comes back soon. Romana. For those who don't know, she was a Companion for The Fourth Doctor. At first, she had to make sure that he got The Key to Time. Once that was taken care of, she kinda became a renegade like The Doctor since, well, she hung out with him for so long. She has the most badass reason for leaving The Doctor: she wanted to protect a universe.

Here's where it gets a little tricky. Our universe has an antimatter universe (not the alternate one that Rose is in). There are articles that can explain antimatter far better than I can, so I won't go into that. There's a universe between our universe and the antimatter universe called ""E-Space"" (not the alternate one that Rose is in). The Doctor and Romana went there twice. One time involved them fighting the last vampires, which was awesome. Millennia ago, there was a long-fought war between Time Lords and vampires that was so bloody and terrible, Gallifrey swore off violence (until the Time War). The last vampires managed to slip into E-Space. Anywho, the second time The Doctor and Romana went to E-Space, she decided to stay behind and protect the few inhabitants of it.

Depending on who you ask, Romana is either still in E-Space or some other thing after the Time War. The audio dramas say that she's president, but Rassilon was president in ""The End of Time"", and that took place at the end of the Time War (sorta). I'd like to think that Romana is still alive and tucked away somewhere because she was a great character and it'd be stupid to not use her again.

It's funny,  your prediction is almost exactly what Mancini has done. He blamed management. He blamed his players. He said they had become complacent after a good season. Well, it looks like he did the exact same thing. 

I don't know all the details about the financial situation. I just know that any investment made in either Mourinho or Ibra would be worth it. You are almost guaranteed a CL semifinal with Mourinho. The difference between going out at the group stages and getting to the final is something like 30 million pounds (correct me if I'm wrong). With the new TV deal there really is no reason not to be spending (again, correct me if I'm wrong). Throw Ibra into the team as well, and you have a team that is day one a CL contender, without question. You could of course also throw other players in there, but as I said elsewhere, to me Ibra would be a cost-effective purchase. 

Cavani and Mancini? Not a day one CL contender in my book. Not with Mancini's record. 

I guess we should talk about what our goals are. My goal is to become a better team than United, and to have success in Europe. I don't think that Mancini is a better manager than SAF. I think Mourinho is. I don't think anyone else in the world is. Ergo, if you want to beat SAF, you gotta get the best guy in the world to do it. Mourinho just knocked out a pretty strong United team and has been dominating Barca lately. How many coaches can say that? 
 
I would love to see Mancini prove me wrong. I think it was the Southampton game that convinced me this team is not Mancini's any more and there's no point in prolonging it through another year. Another year going out in the group stages will mark our team as chokers and not champions. 

If Mourinho DID want to stay long term, we are the perfect fit for that. We are building an amazing academy. We have great facilities (which he trained at recently, btw). We have a great organization. And he would have all the challenge he needed in trying to dethrone United. I don't see Mourinho as the type to walk in anyone's shadow, so I don't see him taking the United job or even wanting it. But he could do amazing things here. 

I guess my point is that, yes, we could continue as is, but I'd like to see us take the next step. I can't stand United and I want to see them humiliated, preferably in Europe. I don't think we can do that with Mancini. And yes, I know we haven't been a huge club for very long, but neither was PSG and look at how easily they are finding European success. If you have the players, a lack of tradition is a weak excuse for not winning. Especially in this day and age where players and managers know that every year things change.

**The Doctor has been white male for 11 incarnations** and some people would feel it odd if he changed. It would be odd but I don't think that's a reason against it. Doctor Who has survived by the long cherished method of ""making stuff up as we go along"". It has no problem bringing in new/weird things or outright contradictions. For example, we had no idea he could regenerate for the first three years of the tv show. How radical would it be to change out the main cast member around whom all the mystery was centered? Yet they changed Hartnell into Troughton. Are we now saying that gender is such a big obstacle that it trumps changing main cast characters?

If we did get a female companion, in the long run years from now, fans of the future would understand exactly why the Doctor was white male for 11 incarnations and then suddenly female: It's the time period. The early 21st century/mid 20th century. The idea of transgenderism (as the Doctor's regeneration could be seen as) is pretty controversial and not widely accepted in today's society.

**Some people feel that gender is a very important part of the character** and believe that gender is one of the fixed aspects of society/their world and that it should not be tampered with (which is also partly why transgenderism is controversial). Personally I feel that gender is useless unless used in a binary (two options: male or female) way. If gender stopped being binary there would be no point in using it as a way to define people and the pressure of comments like ""because you're X gender you should like pink/blue"" would not be a thing.

Also I feel that the Doctor is not particularly masculine or feminine in a traditional sense. He's not athletic, impulsively aggressive, domineering. He's emotional, sensitive and intelligent. Things that all people can be (and should be imo; even if society goes around telling men they aren't allowed to cry). Including core traits like intelligence and sensitivity is the Doctor's eccentricity and optimism. These traits are (imo) essential to the character of the Doctor but they are not male-exclusive traits.

**People don't want the character to be a gimmick**, which is a fair concern. Doing a gender swap is a big move and a real minefield. We don't want the Doctor to be making a joke out of being female but also don't want it to be ignored. This one is all up to whether or not you trust the writers to do a good job. I don't know if I do.

**Plus, would anyone buy it?** I have a feeling that the casual audience would flip the heck out. People might cite this time period as the time when Doctor Who finally jumps the shark. There would be backlash. There would be people just waiting to see sexism where there is none (or maybe the writers suck at their jobs). It's a minefield.

**The Doctor's relationships** are another concern. What would happen between he and River? How would the companion dynamic change? Well it'd sure be something interesting to explore, that's all I can say. Though we don't know River's sexuality preferences, she seems pretty open to me. Though you can have a romantic relationship without having a sexual one (it's called asexual romanticism as opposed to aromantic asexuality).

**Historical concern** is an issue. The Doctor would be at a disadvantage if she ever visited time periods on Earth (even today in some places) where women are treated poorly (um like all the time periods lol). It's like the crap Martha took as the Doctor took her to past time periods. It would be interesting. It might or might not be addressed. For one thing, sexism towards women in the past wouldn't be an issue if all the Earth stories we wrote about weren't set in European or post-European-contact societies or other societies that treat women as lessers. Also, how big of an issue has being female been for the Doctor's companions who go to past time periods? Not too much. The show glosses that stuff over or it gets a random comment somewhere.

**In spite of all of this** I would still be interested and would still give it a shot. Plus, there is a spin-off media character called **Iris Wildthyme** who travels through space and time in a red double decker bus that's smaller on the inside armed only with her intelligence and handy sonic corkscrew. She's a batty crazy older woman who likes to drink and has adventures. She's met the Doctor in alt. media and often her stories are parodies of his. In a meta sort of way, Iris seems to think she's had the same experiences as the Doctor (as if she is him) but she also knows her life is a parody of his. She comes from the Clockworks people (code for Time Lords) and is possibly from the Obverse (whatever that is). She's pretty much a female Doctor and great. All her stories are intentionally campy funny and fun but still maintain good writing. Iris is an awesome character and I encourage people to try out a story of hers to get an idea of a female Doctor. Plus she's played by Katy Manning, the actress who played Jo Grant, 3rd Doctor companion.

**EDIT A Reality Check.** I should just mention this. Besides sexism/racism, there are others reasons why a female/non-white Doctor isn't likely. Casting. Most people who audition are likely to be able white cisgendered British males. Because the show is made in Britain. And because Doctor Who is a product of Western society. We watch shows that reflect our culture. It's not diverse but it's not necessarily bad. It's like how there are American and British versions of The Office to deal with the humor differences in the two cultures. So too is Doctor Who a product of the culture it came from (see the sexual and gender politics of the 60s in Doctor Who for a reflection of culture). It's great to be idealistic about this stuff but we also just have to accept it. Though this doesn't mean we stop trying to push for diversity.

~~You can't be that stupid.~~ Sorry, I respectfully disagree.  

The goes almost a decade without losing a league game at home. 

He wins league titles in Portugal, England, Italy and Spain. 

As for Europe, let's let his record speak for itself:

Porto:

2002/03: Won UEFA Cup 
2003/04: Champion's League winner (advanced out of group stage featuring Real Madrid and Marseille, and beat Manchester United and Lyon on the way to the final).

Chelsea: 

2004/05: Champion's league semifinal, beating Barcelona and Bayern on the way to a slim defeat by Liverpool
2005/06: Lost to Barcelona, the eventual champions in the round of 16. 
2006/07: Semifinals again
So, in 3 years, he got to the semifinals twice, and was defeated by the eventual winners twice. Of course, during this time he was also setting all sorts of records domestically, including a record number of points and a record fewest goals conceded. 

Inter

08/09: Round of 16, loss to a good United team who reached the final. 
09/10: Champion's League winner, won the treble as well.

Madrid

10/11: Semifinals, losing to Champion's Barca (one of the best teams of all time), rampaged all the way through though. 
11/12: Semifinals, barely losing to a very good Bayern team
12/13: In the quarterfinals, one of the favorites to win it all. 

So, since 2004 Mourinho has won the entire thing twice, been to the semifinals 4 times, and never not advanced to the group stage. 

So I don't think it's outrageous to say that Mourinho guarantees you a strong run in Europe every year. His record speaks for itself. 

Let's look at Mancini since taking over Inter:
2004/05: Quarterfinals, lost to Milan. No shame in that. 
2005/06: Lose to the mighty Villareal in the quarterfinals
2006/07: Lose to Valencia in the round of 16
2007/08: Lose to Liverpool in the round of 16

And of course, our situation, going out in the freaking group stage two years in a row.... 

And, tell me, you are a rich sheikh with unlimited money. When you spend hundreds of millions, you want to win Europe. Which coach would you go for? 

You have your head in the sand. You're blinded by a ridiculous loyalty to Mancini. He isn't getting the job done. He has to go.

Liverpool are going in the right direction and playing fantastic football. There's no one denying that. But at the moment we are fighting for a CL spot and you are not. 

So if we honestly believe your squad to be better, surely you are massively underachieving by being in 7th, are you not ? You can't use the new manager excuse because we're in the same boat. You can't use the financial excuse because you spend more money on both wages and transfer fees. The truth is that while you have some fantastic players, you do not have a better squad than us.

I'm not stupid, I'm not ignorant, and I haven't accused you of being either. 

Mourinho has been lucky. My stance is that anyone that has had success in any knockout competition ever has been lucky. They've also been skillful, but they wouldn't have won without luck on their side. The point is to show that using a knockout competition as a barometer of managerial competence is flawed.

Let me be clear, Mourinho is an excellent manager - currently one of the best in the world - but he isn't some kind of magic wand that grants instant champions league success. Look at Chelsea. It wasn't Mourinho that brought them.their first CL title was it? It was Roberto Di Matteo. Please tell me how Chelsea were the best team in Europe last year and how they didn't rely on a hefty dose of luck. Tell me how he was so much better than Fergie, who you'll remember couldn't navigate the easy group we talked about. 

If I was a rich sheikh motivated by furthering my nation's reputation as a global business hub so as to have a strong financial footing once the oil dries up, there is no fucking chance on this earth that I show myself to be impatient by firing a manager that brought success to the team and replacing him with a volatile journeyman that I know will lash out at me when things don't go his way.

I keep going back to it, but it's short-termism at it's very worst to fire a manager that has brought the FA Cup, the Premier League and the Community Shield in the short time he's been manager because he's currently *only* 2nd in the league. And why is he second in the league? Because Brian Marwood went it and weakened the team over the summer when he should have been strengthening it. Well he's been poor somewhere where he can't do any harm and if we don't fire Mancini well have a nice watcher to go out and spend on strengthening the team this summer.

As previously stated by me (and everyone else except you it seems) he is too old and would cost too much. The idea of weakening our squad by losing silva or aguero (replacing either of them with an old man would weaken the squad) is so wrong words fail me. You seem to be blinded by this one player to the point you would sacrifice real proven quality, players who are young enough to continue to developer even more than they have already.

All for a 31 year old striker who is unproven in the very demanding league that is the premier league. A very expensive player we would no doubt have to offer a 4 year contract to, taking him to 35/36! It makes no sense whatsoever, your opinions are naive and poorly thought out. They bear almost no relation to reality.

I'll just say that luck is one thing, but what's the quote, ""the more I train, the luckier I get""?

I don't think it's normal when you're out of the competition at a very early stage."" Yeah, luck always plays a role. Look at the Nani red card. But that's always the case. It wasn't just luck that Chelsea won the CL. They scored twice in the Camp Nou with ten men. Drogba had one of the most clutch goals in CL history. They may not have been the best team on paper, but they were the best team on the field.

I think it's wrong to associate short termism with changing managers. So long as you allow each manager a chance to prove themselves, you don't have to worry about deterring other good managers. We are so far away from a Chelsea situation. This is Mancini's third year. Yes, he is a good manager. The team was amazing last year. But this year, the team took a big step backward. Look at how we wiped the floor with United last year, and this year looked second best. We're at least ten points off where we were last year, and scored a lot less goals. Knocked out in the group stages. 

I don't like the trajectory we are on. Mancini always says ""I want to have to the team in a position to win titles"", instead of, I want to win every title. He has done his part to build the team, but I don't think he can take the next step. I don't think he knows how.

Yeah, he might have a dispute with a coach, or get a red card now and then, but his intensity inspires teammates. It always has. And obviously, when someone of his incredible talent is around, the level of everyone goes up. 

Robben, I don't know as much about, but again, just look at his results. Yeah, he plays for the best teams in the world, but we only have to look at our own team to see that's not enough. You have to have a champion's mentality. You have to be ultra-competitive. That's what it takes to win. Robben has that. He's been on really good clubs who have achieved enormously. Like I said, we have great guys like Kompany, Milner, Zaba, yaya, but who is the guy that's leading the locker room when the shit hits the fan? I'm not entirely sure. We need a couple more big personalities to shake things up and move in a new direction.

Yes, we can use the new manager excuse seeing as we've had a massive squad overhaul by shifting nine players and bringing in four, on top of trying to implement an entirely different way of playing. Your new manager has carried on from where Redknapp left off. Pretty much every pundit agrees with that.

I don't think our squad is better, but I do think it's massively younger. Second youngest in the league in fact. I *do* think our starting 11 is as good, if not better.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Ibra became great in Italy, the toughest defensive league. In Italy sometimes you get one or two chances in a game, in England you'll get one or two a half. edit: And I'll add, Ibra has been scoring at a nearly 1:1 pace over the last few years. In Italy last year, he scored 28 goals in 32 games. In Italy. 

Based on the truly awful defense that's been played in the premier league this year, I don't think he would have any problems. He's had the same goal ratio in the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and now France. 

If he was Thierry Henry or Schevchenko, I wouldn't get him. Those types of players rely on pace. Ibra relies on technical ability, physical strength (which won't decline with age), intelligence, and aggression. He doesn't get hurt. The dude is a rock of consistency. As he has said, he actually gets better with age because he is so smart and can learn new ways to score goals. Just look at the quality of goals he has scored for Sweden and PSG this year. Unbelievable. He makes it look so easy, because it is for him. He can out muscle any defender in the world. 

As for older players, no strikers come to mind immediately, but you could just look at Ryan Giggs, Zanetti, and others who have been able to remain consistently good almost until 40. Yes, they are an exception, but great players are also great trainers and take care of themselves. They can have prolonged careers. All I'm saying is we could get good use of Ibra for 3 or 4 years. I think it's pretty obvious if you watched him play this year that he isn't slowing down any time soon, and his desire has never been stronger.

true,Murumasa,null,null,"Last year my Uncle committed suicide. 

I got a call in my first year of uni. In my second term. My auntie died of brain cancer, a long-standing illness that suddenly became worse and she died within a couple days of it flaring up, she was buried a week later. 

My uncle had not seen me nor my father (his brother) in years simply as my family weren't ones to meet up very often. The last time I think I was around 13 and I borrowed a VHS of Amistad and played a RTS tank game that I can't remember very much of. Point being nearly a decade, and he had simply carved out a nice quiet existence with the love of his life on the South coast.

We went to the funeral. During which he was cracking jokes. Trying hard to make us all laugh, he was tearful and clearly devastated, but he also was very witty. At one point a tearful 30 year came up to him, my uncle was around 55, and said:

""I am sorry. I knew her well and she was a great woman""

My uncle replied ""Knew her? What do you mean by that!?"" (Stressing the word Knew in the biblical sense)

""What? I... er... from work..."" He replied and went off, as my uncle turned around and laughed to himself and winked at us.

After the funeral we went to his nice home where they had spent the last decade together. I generally cry at silly things in films, and when music is epic and passionate, but I didn't really sob around real things. I just remained quiet calm and tried to look after my Dad and Uncle. At one point however when I went with him to the garage he told me:

""Don't let your Dad push you around or boss you around too much. He was a bit like that when we were kids."" (He was the younger brother. I am the eldest like my Dad)

""Oh don't worry he is really supportive, not too harsh. I'm a bit worse to my brother to be honest"" Then he put his arm to my shoulder, had a smoke and reminisced a bit. I sometimes think back to that and wonder if it was obvious. If I could have realized he was setting his final wishes straight. Imparting some last advice. I just thought he was being reminiscent as we all were.

Six week later I am back at uni. It was the end of the first year and I'm pulling the minimum effort to pass because fuck first year right? Then I get a call again. Always when I get a call now from my folks, as they normally Facebook or text or email, I think it is bad news. 

My Dad says my uncle John killed himself. Later we would find out he had had a bath, poured a drink for himself and my aunt (but not drank anything so he was clear headed), taken all her remaining pain medicine and died in his favourite spot of his favourite part of the house where they would curl up together. 

I don't know if anyone else can take much away from this. I have always been worried that my family would kill themselves, just a paranoid fear whenever they get angry or do something stupid. I had real guilt that I could have done something or noticed anything but the truth is he didn't want to live anymore and made a conscious decision to meet her in the afterlife as he couldn't wait. My Dad, who as a coping mechanism romantically framed it like a modern day middle age Romeo and Juliet, was heartbroken about losing his little brother and I am now still worried more than ever about losing mine as we are both so similar. All I know is I wish you didn't do a stupid thing like that and fucking kill yourself John.

I hope you guys can indulge me with this long writing. I can only frame what happened in relation to myself, and although it is true those that wish to commit suicide need the most help before, after those they leave behind are put into possibly even worse positions. Racked by guilt, by a lack of forethought, by deep regret, but hatred for those that were selfish to do such a thing, and by fear that someone they love will do it again.

true,Late_Night_Grumbler,eccleston,Eccleston,"&gt; I wouldn't feel like the writers were insulting us or commenting on gender. I'd just think that they suck at handling this kind of situation.

If the female Time Lord's stories were worse, her plots more sloppy, and the show generally worse, then people would definitely take that as a sign that they weren't trying as hard. Perhaps because she was female. At the very least, it wouldn't look good.

&gt; Amy is not a hapless ditz. It's the companion's job to be saved. Just like how many times Rory has died.

Amy is the definition of a hapless ditz. She's dumb, overly promiscuous, and she's fragrantly disobedient and ignorant to the point where she wears it like a badge that she shows whenever the Doctor annoys her. ""Look at me, I'm so dumb and can't do anything, yet I insist on being the center of attention. Stupid Rory for loving me and waiting 2,000 years.""

The companion's job is *not* to be saved. That may have been a lot of what the most recent ones have done, but I've seen plenty of companions who could hold their own. Look at Christine, the thief – not only did she hold her own, but she was actually smart and the Doctor needed *her* to get the crystal plating. She wasn't a tag along or damsel in distress.

&gt; I thought your point was that all of Moffat's women are cranky wives or ditzes? Madame Vastra and Jenny are neither.

Madame Vastra is the definition of cranky. Jenny is a ditz.

&gt; Um, excuse me? The only legitimate woman? What does that even mean? They're not really women? The word legitimate has got to stop being thrown around.

You're grouping the wrong words together. She isn't the only legitimate *woman*, she's the only legitimate *example* of a woman who doesn't have any major personality flaws. 

&gt; Plus, Moffat does not write awful mothers. Nancy was great, even if her time as a ""mother"" was scant. She was resourceful and smart. So was Madge. So was Amy. Sally Sparrow wasn't awful. I don't see how any of these characters are awful. You're going to have to explain what's so terrible about them to me because I don't get it.

Nancy hardly counts as a mother, Madge was lying to her family, and I've already explored Amy as a person. My point isn't that they're bad mothers. My point is that they're mothers with bad personalities. Look at Donna's mom, Martha's mom, and Rose's mom. The three biggest moms of the the 9 and 10 era were all horrible shrews. 

Your best example of a mother is Nancy and Madge, a liar and a poor girl who wasn't even really a mother for most of the episode. May as well have been a sister.

&gt; Mels was screwed up because her character was brainwashed to be a psycopath. But that doesn't mean he doesn't write female characters well. Female characters are allowed to be screwed up. At least she doesn't have multiple counts of genocide like the Doctor. As for Mels getting introduced and then dying within one episode, that's poor plot writing, not poor character writing. It seems like you have a problem with Mels/River's arc; but there's nothing poor about the character writing (being a psychopath does not equal bad writing).

It's not about Mels as a person or as a character. It's that she should've played a much bigger role than she did. She was introduced and killed in the blink of an eye. C'mon! Why weren't we told that Amy's best friend was her daughter in one of her later regenerations? It's a huge plot twist that shows up for 10 seconds, and then is swept way equally fast. And then she suddenly changes her mind and takes pity on the Doctor after being taught to hate him and fulfilling her orders to assassinate him? Then she just seemlessly decides that she'll stay in the 1940s and blend in?

I will concede one thing: my problem is mostly with the writing and not with the characters. I hated Rose at first, but every companion since has shown me just how great she was and how awful they were. Regardless, the writing in season six and seven was just atrocious and sloppy. Like Moffat finished it 10 minutes before a deadline. ",0,1362800738,null,0,false,0,c8seq46,t3_19xukr,t1_c8seq46,t1_c8seh2e,null,1431528865,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Amy is not a hapless ditz and she's not dumb. She may be selfish, but when does she trip over things or miss the most obvious of facts?

And how is she overly promiscuous? Who has she slept with besides Rory? So she tried to have a one night's stand with the Doctor. Two people. Furthermore, how can being promiscuous even be a bad trait? Guys get to sleep around, Amy can too if she wants. Wanting to have sex is not a bad trait. In fact, it's encouraged for guys to be ""players"".

""Fragrantly disobedient and ignorant""? What? Like we all want obedient little puppies for companions? No way.

Amy is not that way towards Rory. The only time she was being mean spirited toward him was in Vampires in Venice. But when she calls him stupid-face it's affectionate.

Let me clarify on the comapnion thing. The companion's job is to be less competant than the Doctor, whether the companion is male or female. The Doctor is the person who provides the information and helps move the plot along. Companions can do this and they have held their own but it is largely the Doctor's job to save the day. Christine the thief was smart yes but she was also not suitable to fit the companion role for writing purposes.

Most importantly, women don't have to be ""superwomen"" to be fit for the status of companion. It's not like Rory was anything other than a tag along. River Song is basically a super woman. Like Jack Harkness.

As for Madame Vastra, how is she cranky? She's flirty. Comments about eating Jack the Ripper, being flippant about being a ""lizard woman from the dawn of time and this is my wife"". She's funny. And Jenny? How is Jenny a ditz? What stupid comment has she made, what has she tripped over, when has she needed saving? Dialogue please, because I do not get it.

&gt;she's the only legitimate example of a woman who doesn't have any major personality flaws.

I've seen this line of argument before. But there's a problem with it, because people are not perfect. Everybody has personality flaws. The difference is, they seem less tolerated in women than in men. Men can be mass murderers or good guys, they can have huge flaws, tragic pasts, etc. etc. and they don't get criticized as ""not legitimate men"" just because they have flaws. It's their flaws that make them believable characters. So why do women have to be perfect? Why do they have to be so much ""better"" than the male characters? Why can't they have major flaws? Who doesn't have major flaws?

Judging from what you say of all the mothers (though Rose, Donna and Martha's were written by RTD), you have no tolerance for crankiness in mothers. Besides, it's not enough to just listen to them yelling. Just look at their feelings and motives. Madge was lying to her kids to protect them from the horrible truth of their father's death. And in the end, she was about to tell them. Lying is not a damnable trait. Like the Doctor didn't lie to Rory about being able to keep both Amys alive in The Girl Who Waited?

You know why Rose and Martha's moms were so mean? Because a mysterious older man snatched their daughters away and whisked them off to who knows where. Their daughters lives were at risk and as far as their mothers knew, this Doctor fellow could be some creep. It's important that they're protective of their daughters. If anything, you should wonder at the lack of father figures. Donna's mom was mean in a different way. It's not enough to call her a shrew. Donna's mother always told Donna that she wouldn't amount to anything. She put Donna down and told Donna to stop waiting for a man to come into her life. The reasons behind these moms' ""shrewness"" reveal their concern and love for their daughters, and in Donna's mother's case, her own insecurity. If anything, it reveals that they're real people. Real people with real problems and real concerns and feelings.

I can't really convince you to be insulted. I'm just sure that *someone* would be, and I wouldn't blame them. Perhaps insulted is the wrong word. Estranged? Unsettled? Put off? 

&gt; Amy is not a hapless ditz and she's not dumb. She may be selfish, but when does she trip over things or miss the most obvious of facts?  
&gt; And how is she overly promiscuous? Who has she slept with besides Rory? So she tried to have a one night's stand with the Doctor. Two people. Furthermore, how can being promiscuous even be a bad trait? Guys get to sleep around, Amy can too if she wants. Wanting to have sex is not a bad trait. In fact, it's encouraged for guys to be ""players"".  
&gt; ""Fragrantly disobedient and ignorant""? What? Like we all want obedient little puppies for companions? No way.  
&gt; Amy is not that way towards Rory. The only time she was being mean spirited toward him was in Vampires in Venice. But when she calls him stupid-face it's affectionate.

She missed the alien creature hiding in her house for over a decade, she prioritizes her 36 years wasted over **2,000** spent waiting by Rory (and not just waiting, but actively watching over her and the Pandorica), she hits on the Doctor *on her wedding night*, she runs away with the Doctor, she doesn't tell Rory most of the story, she equally hides it from the Doctor, and she insults Rory far too often for it to be within the realm of tolerable affection. She's abducted by the Silurians because she stumbles about, she's quite rude toward Rory during the vampires episode (which you noted), she often prioritizes the Doctor over Rory, and she's just generally useless as a companion. Look at Rory – he helps, he has a positive attitude, he thinks, he was great help aboard the Silurian junk ship, and he's just generally more useful than Amy. *He* should've been the companion. 

Amy's purpose is to get into trouble. She is a plot element with a half-baked personality.

I'm not going to conduct an argument here about gender and sexuality. She tried to cheat on Rory and adultery isn't acceptable for any gender. I couldn't care less if she was single and tried to sleep with the Doctor. Hell, sleep with everyone in London. Just don't cheat on anyone!

&gt; Let me clarify on the comapnion thing. The companion's job is to be less competant than the Doctor, whether the companion is male or female. The Doctor is the person who provides the information and helps move the plot along. Companions can do this and they have held their own but it is largely the Doctor's job to save the day. Christine the thief was smart yes but she was also not suitable to fit the companion role for writing purposes.

Rory is a great example of a companion who wasn't dumb. Companions are supposed to be inferior when compared to the Doctor, but they don't have to be dumb and they don't have to fall for every obvious tramp or just be generally clumsy. They can encounter problems with the Doctor and simply serve as the audience, i.e., a surrogate for the Doctor to explain things that the audience would need to know. 

&gt; Most importantly, women don't have to be ""superwomen"" to be fit for the status of companion. It's not like Rory was anything other than a tag along. River Song is basically a super woman. Like Jack Harkness.

I'd settle for someone who didn't spend most of their time being held captive or hostage. River Song would've been a great companion. She outwitted the Doctor all of the time. ""It doesn't make that noise. You had the parking break on."" Jack was even better! He let himself get caught and even killed because he knew he could turn it to his advantage. He was clever as hell.

Hell, even Rose was great. If 9 ever had to rescue her, then it was mostly his fault that she was in trouble.

&gt; As for Madame Vastra, how is she cranky? She's flirty. Comments about eating Jack the Ripper, being flippant about being a ""lizard woman from the dawn of time and this is my wife"". She's funny. And Jenny? How is Jenny a ditz? What stupid comment has she made, what has she tripped over, when has she needed saving? Dialogue please, because I do not get it.


I'm not saying that Vastra isn't entertaining. She's just strict and no-nonsense. She's cranky. Perhaps not too much so, and I'll even concede that she was a great character, but she was a lot like a female lizard version of Red Forman from *That 70s Show*. 

Jenny was just a hapless lackey. I don't remember much of her personality, honestly. I do remember Vastra treating her more like a child than a wife, but whatever.

&gt; I've seen this line of argument before. But there's a problem with it, because people are not perfect. Everybody has personality flaws. The difference is, they seem less tolerated in women than in men. Men can be mass murderers or good guys, they can have huge flaws, tragic pasts, etc. etc. and they don't get criticized as ""not legitimate men"" because they have flaws. It's their flaws that make them believable characters. So why do women have to be perfect? Why do they have to be so much ""better"" than the male characters? Why can't they have major flaws? Who doesn't have major flaws?

**PLEASE** stop starting gender arguments. It was never my intention to demean women or to scrutinize them more closely than men. There are plenty of irrational men with character flaws on the show. There are more male villains, more weird male characters, and most of the monsters (aliens that aren't humanoid) are men. Even the angry robots are usually male in appearance (Cybermen have no female characteristics). 

It was a writers choice to have more flawed women than men. I'm not saying that women, as a gender, are more flawed. I'm saying that the show has more flawed women than passable women. It's a critique of the writer's choices. Not of women. 

&gt; Judging from what you say of all the mothers (though Rose, Donna and Martha's were written by RTD), you have no tolerance for crankiness in mothers. Besides, it's not enough to just listen to them yelling. Just look at their feelings and motives. Madge was lying to her kids to protect them from the horrible truth of their father's death. And in the end, she was about to tell them. Lying is not a damnable trait. Like the Doctor didn't lie to Rory about being able to keep both Amys alive in The Girl Who Waited?

Rose's, Donna's and Martha's mothers were all above and beyond most people's tolerance for crankiness. They were downright b-words (which I'd say if it wasn't for this subreddit's ridiculous swear filters). They yelled, they shouted, they went kicking and screaming no matter what. They tried to hurt the Doctor even when he was trying to help them. They were rude, pushy, and you know what? He didn't steal any of them. They went along willingly. Rose was a bit young, but Martha was in her late 20s and Donna looked at least 40. There was no reason whatsoever for them to be so cranky about it. 

&gt; You know why Rose and Martha's moms were so mean? Because a mysterious older man snatched their daughters away and whisked them off to who knows where. Their daughters lives were at risk and as far as their mothers knew, this Doctor fellow could be some creep. It's important that they're protective of their daughters. If anything, you should wonder at the lack of father figures. Donna's mom was mean in a different way. It's not enough to call her a shrew. Donna's mother always told Donna that she wouldn't amount to anything. She put Donna down and told Donna to stop waiting for a man to come into her life. The reasons behind these moms' ""shrewness"" reveal their concern and love for their daughters, and in Donna's mother's case, her own insecurity. If anything, it reveals that they're real people. Real people with real problems and real concerns and feelings.

No, you know what real people do? They say their feelings. They say things like, ""I'm so worried about you."" Not, ""GET AWAY FROM THAT MAN AND HIS BOX!"" Their daughters had a chance that so few other beings alive would get, and that most of the universe would jump at. The Doctor saved them time and time again, but no matter what evidence they presented, they hated him. 9 sent Rose back by tricking her! He did the right thing! He saved her and doomed himself, and yet his mom was still a cranky shrew to him even when he was 10. He proved he was worth respected and admiration. 

&gt; I agree that the Mels storyline was shoved in last minute, I just don't think it means Mels was a bad character. I liked Mels.

true,nssmuckers,null,null,"&gt;Yes, we can use the new manager excuse seeing as we've had a massive squad overhaul by shifting nine players and bringing in four, on top of trying to implement an entirely different way of playing. Your new manager has carried on from where Redknapp left off. Pretty much every pundit agrees with that.

This is absolutely shockingly ignorant and I fear I'll be arguing with a rock here, but I'll try anyway. 

You've proven in just a few sentences that you A) Don't do your research and B) Don't know a hell of a lot about tactics.

What about our squad overhaul? We've signed 8 players in two windows and lost 10 from the first team. Why doesn't that count? We sold two of our best 3 players in one summer and lost our club captain to retirement, you sold or released some squad players. You're being very dismissive of the changes at our club. 

Your point about carrying on from Redknapp is why I'm worried about even trying to argue because it's maddeningly off-base. If you'd be willing to look at this with an open mind I'm 100% willing to write an essay on how we're completely tactically different under AVB, but if you've convinced yourself we play the same way let me know so I can save myself the trouble. If you can provide some citations of all the pundits who think we're playing the same way, that would be excellent too, but I suspect you just added that in there as some sort of validation for what is a woefully incorrect statement. 

Wages and transfer fees are not moot. Even with your new more restrained and sustainable approach, your net transfer expenditure and wage bill exceed ours. You seem eager to flaunt your club's history and worldwide fanbase, and that's understandable, but you have to understand that gives you certain financial advantages.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Amy missed the alien creature hiding in her house because of a perception filter. Her whole family missed it. Rory and Mels missed it all those times they hung out at her house.

As for the 36 vs 2000 years argument, there is a huuuuuge difference between those situations. Rory didn't get hungry, thirsty, tired. He chose, willingly, to protect Amy. He had all kinds of adventures, met people and became a legend. And he knew that he would see Amy again. She was always there, safe in a box. Amy got left behind against her will, once again waiting for the Doctor and Rory to save her. She aged. Her life wasted away with no human contact. The brain starts to deteriorate after an hour of deprivation. Not having another human to speak to for 36 years? Horrible. Amy didn't ask Rory to wait for her. He didn't have to do it. Frankly, he was so spineless in series 5, watching as Amy seemed to like the Doctor more, that I was happy that he finally became a Roman and fought for her. He did something incredibly nice for her. And then he throws it back in her face in series 7.

She tried to sleep with the Doctor on her wedding night. Except that she didn't actually love him, and in my opinion, cheating with love is much bigger a crime than cheating without love. Plus, she had just escaped near-death in the TARDIS with the Doctor. It probably didn't feel like the night before her wedding night. And she -didn't- cheat on Rory. If she insults Rory ""far too often"", then how come Rory puts up with it? WHy does he even like her? Because he knows that when Amy calls him stupid-face, it's a nickname. Like how friends call each other b-tch but they
don't mean it.

She does not prioritize the Doctor over Rory. Lots of people overlook the fact that Amy sacrifices her life for Rory. Twice. Amy is abducted by the Silurians, yes. Well, Rory gets shot by them. But Rory -and- Amy were useful on the Silurian junk ship. Amy was being all resourceful, navigating the computers and figuring stuff out. She was back to back with that hunter going up against dinosaurs armed with a tranquilizer gun.

I don't think any of the companions are dumb really. Everybody makes stupid mistakes. Especially when you're out of your depth, time travelling to alien planets and suddenly having your life threatened left and right.

Amy is held captive by the Silurians, by the Silence, by Madame Kovarian and the soldiers. Rory is held captive by the Angels, he is killed in Amy's Choice and Cold Blood. He's erased from time as well. His future self is killed by the angels. He kills himself in a destroyed timeline. He's killed in The Black Spot. Rory's died more than Amy's been held captive.

And how does Vastra treat Jenny like a child? Again, dialogue please.

Furthermore, it's kind of hard to *not* bring gender into this when your argument is that all the female characters have major flaws that make them not-passable characters. There are definitely more male characters/representation than female, yes. Alien races are usually male, even if they're ""genderless"" because male is the ""Default"" gender. I never said that you thought women were more flawed in general. I never implied that you were demeaning women. I think you're scritizing them more. Because I think that the ratio of flawed to not-flawed women is the same ratio for men as well. That's just my point. I think that everybody is flawed and that the females in general, are not written more flawed than the males.

&gt;There was no reason whatsoever for them to be so cranky about it.

Well I already explained their point of view. The snatching of their child by a mysterious man. The life-in-danger. Rose goes *missing for a whole year*, only to come back with a mysterious man whom Jackie has never met? Look at it from their point of view. They have every reason to be absolutely furious. I would be. And that's why the moms look like shrews. Because the only time we see them is when the comapnions go back home, and when the companions have to go back home to the ""real world"" of real consequences, sh-t goes down.

Furthermore, Jackie does warm up to the Doctor. She begins to trust him later on (see how she does not have barely contained fury when he returns in The Christmas Invasion). But I dont' know what planet you're living on, but most people do not go ""I'm am so angry/disappointed/sad."" People scream and shout, kick things, lie, cheat, get frustrated. They cry and kill.

true,Late_Night_Grumbler,eccleston,Eccleston,"Rory couldn't know that the situation would be resolved. And he couldn't meet people or have adventures! He never aged, never ate, never slept. He's a plastic something or other. He had to carefully hide himself and keep shifting around to avoid suspicion, never knowing when it would end or if it would end. Amy's situation may have been more boring, but she found ways to occupy herself. It wasn't Shangri-La, but it was 36 years, not 2,000. And then she tried to divorce him because she thought he'd mind that she was unable to have a child!

It doesn't matter what kind of cheating it was. She tried to cheat on him. She'd have done it, and in my mind, that's as bad as actually cheating. The only difference between the two is that someone else with sense had to stop her. Rory follows her around because he loves her. He puts up with it because he knows she has a positive side. I can love someone and enjoy who they are at their best, but still detest some of their worse habits. People are package deals, good and bad.

It's not about being dumb, per se. Some companions are just not as careful. They're not as wary of their surroundings, they're more liable to go gallivanting around, and some are just downright clumsy.

Rory's deaths weren't his fault. Amy's captivity is usually the result of her being reckless. She should've stayed with that CIA guy instead of going off alone to investigate the Silence. She should've told the Doctor about seeing the woman slide the hatch open everywhere. She kept *a lot* to herself when she shouldn't have. 

I can't remember the dialogue between Vastra and Jenny. Hell, they just appear in one episode with no background and a brief sentence explaining something about the Doctor helping them. It's just a general feeling.

The Doctor proves himself repeatedly. Being shrews at first is understandable. Staying miserable shrews for three season no matter what happens, including being reunited with your long lost husband, means that you have personality flaws and are no longer simply reacting to the situation. 

Actions do speak louder than words. That's why I consider most of the moms to be shrews. Look at Donna's mother. All she does is get in the way. Not everyone becomes like them when emotions run high.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Except that Rory did know what he was fighting for. But how do you know he didn't meet people and have adventures? All those photos of him in the museum? He had to interact with people in order to get a job at the museum to guard the box. Presumably he also interacted with people in the past as the box continued to move around. He moved with it. And he didn't have to age. Amy seriously thought she was going to die there. Alone and without Rory. And I doubt her time was boring as she seemed to spend most of her time trying to not get killed by the Handbots. The difference is, Amy has never thrown stuff from the past back in Rory's face like the way he threw the 2000 years in her face. At least when she was divorcing him because of the child she was doing it for him. She didn't want to be a disappointment to Rory. She knew he wanted kids badly. What she did was wrong, but she did it with good intentions.

Besides the fact that Amy does tell the Doctor about Madame Kovarian, you seriously can't be blaming Amy for other people kidnapping her? I could easily do it the other way. i.e. Rory was so stupid going into a building full of angels, getting himself trapped. He should've run faster so as not to get shot by the Silurian. He shouldn't have been so clumsy and got himself cut, or else he wouldn't have died in the Black Spot. But everything I just said there is ridiculous. Putting the blame on Rory or Amy for the misfortune they experience is silly.

As for the mothers, they only see the Doctor once in a while; and at that point they're more concerned that their daughters aren't dead. They don't watch the Doctor save the world again and again every season like we do. They don't know that he's the last of his kind or that he's an alien or that he's so nice. Not when they first meet him. Though as I said, Jackie does warm to the Doctor. Martha's mom only meets the Doctor once, and she really was cold to him. Donna's mother is angry too but gets over it. See how not-hostile she was to the Doctor in Journey's End/Stolen Earth? And she's even grateful to the Doctor when he briefly visits again at the End of Time.

He couldn't have know that it was end so favorably (well, sort of favorably). His life must have been agonizing. If he spent too much time in one place, people would notice he doesn't age. What if his coworkers invited him to lunch? What if they wondered why he was never sick, absent, or showed any signs of fatigue or aging? It must have been extremely excruciating trying to apply for jobs, hoping they didn't realize that someone just like you had been seen around the box earlier, forging new documents every time, establishing new identities, escaping persecution because you don't eat or sleep. Amy knew the Doctor was coming. She knew it was a waiting game. She knew time didn't function properly because it was a medical ward. She may not have known the full details, but she knew what was coming. Rory threw it back in her face maybe once; at most, twice. And that's after she insults him 24/7. How long could *you* go without shouting, ""I WAITED TWO THOUSAND YEARS AND KEPT YOUR BOX SAFE FROM ALL MANNER OF HARM, PLEASE STOP INSULTING ME SO OFTEN!"" Waiting 2,000 years is worth throwing in someone's face once or twice. That he didn't do it more often shows how awesome he was.

Putting the blame on Amy and Rory for all of their misfortunes would be silly. Putting the blame on them for many of their misfortunes would be accurate.

Paradox upon paradox after Rory just *had* to investigate.

And I still think that a life of adventure (which means danger, yes) and seeing history fold out is more interesting than aging to death in a sterile hospital. Because Amy -didn't- know if they would come back. They said they would, but as time wore on and she got older and older, you can see how she stopped believing it.

I don't think they muck things up. I think they face the inevitable misfortunes that befall anybody who travels with the Doctor (pretty much most of his companions have tragic endings). I didn't really find the Angels Take Manhattan all that moving, but I don't think either Amy or Rory was a bad character because of some supposed uselessness or clumsiness, ditziness, selfishness, etc. etc. I just don't think either of them had any character flaws that made them bad characters, even if they aren't characters I even like.

I think that by the end of the mothers' runs, they know what their children have been getting up to. It's like when 9 and Rose stay at Rose's apartment and everybody is watching tv and having laughs. Rose talked to her mom then. Jackie wasn't busy chewing 9 out. Though 9 did step out of the room because it was gettin a little ""human"" in there for him. Do you remember the way Jackie talks about Rose in Love and Monsters? She knows what Rose is doing. She even asks the Doctor at one point if he can promise to bring her daughter back safely. I think that Jackie understands the most of the three mothers. Martha's mother doesn't really seem to have time for Martha. The one glimpse we get of Martha's family shows them all bickering with each other. At the end of the Lazarus Experiment they're all bickering and one by one, each one runs off to get involved in family junk, leaving Martha standing alone... And I'd say that Donna's mom understands Donna the least.

Jackie lashes out and then comes to understand and even trust the Doctor. Martha's mom immediately dislikes him and never sees him again. Donna's mom puts Donna down and is suspicious of the Doctor until the end of series 4 and the End of Time. So that's two seasons for Jackie and one season each for Martha's mom (1 episode) and Donna's mom who, like Jackie, comes around. I think this shows careful planning of character change.

edit: Edit that, I'm wrong. Martha's mom reappears in the series 3 finale where she's too busy being a slave and living in fear of the Master to hate the Doctor. In fact, I""m sure she was praying with the Doctor that whole time, contributing to the Archangel Network. I guess all three mothers come around, even if Martha's mom gets retconned into forgetting.",0,1362808300,null,0,1362808592,0,c8sgk9o,t3_19xukr,t1_c8sgk9o,t1_c8sgdcc,null,1431529823,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

I would imagine the Canal route would be a lot safer, and I always take that route. There have been multiple deaths along Dalry\Gorgie road over the last couple of years, and recent road works makes it difficult for cyclists.

Perhaps you could have an option where cyclists could add ""areas of danger"" , and then that data can be analyzed to further refine your program. IMHO I think sites like these are vastly improved by community data. I think cyclists who regular use the routes I mentioned would choose the Canal route as much safer, but then I could be wrong.

I noticed routes that were very safe in my experience, such as the old railyway path were correctly given a high score, however, sometimes the alternative using streets was as high as 9.5. It's a bit confusing. 9.5 seems pretty safe too but I'd always choose the railyway path for safety, so it's hard to understand how the ratings will translate to the cycling experience.

Highly unlikely. Most people in the UN are talking about the Falkland Islands becoming their own independent country in the next 50 years. The people there don't want to be ""owned"" by anyone, there is a lot of people and they are all very wealthy now, this ins't a few sheep farmers, this is several thousand wealthy people with their own airline, airports, naval fleet, coast guard etc etc. They need and want British protection for now, but before long there is a lot of talk on the island of becoming their own independent country. They will never ever accept being ""handed over"" to Argentina, not once they become their own country.

This is what Argentina is worried about, they have to act quickly to stop this happening (next 10 years or so), or it will be too late. The Falkland Islands will get their own country status at the UN, their own table as a new country in UN organisations and Argentina will be crying alone sad because it will be game over.

Instead of calling it 'your family home' when your kids have moved out, how about letting another family move in. They are probably in cramped, uncomfortable, unsuitable housing whilst you enjoy your 3 bed house many of the working population could never afford.

&gt;A man was on holiday in Kenya. While he was walking through the bush, he came across an elephant standing with one leg raised in the air. The elephant seemed distressed so the man approached it very carefully. He got down on one knee and inspected the elephant's foot. There was a large thorn deeply embedded in the bottom of the foot.
&gt;
&gt;As carefully and as gently as he could he removed the thorn and the elephant gingerly put down its foot. The elephant turned to face the man and, with a rather stern look on its face, stared at him. For a good ten minutes the man stood frozen - thinking of nothing else but being trampled.  Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned, and walked away.
&gt;
&gt;For years after, the man remembered the elephant and the events of that day.
&gt;
&gt;One day the man was walking through the zoo with his son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to where they were standing at the rail. It stared at him and the man couldn't help wondering if this was the same elephant.
&gt;
&gt;After a while it trumpeted loudly; then it continued to stare at him. The man summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder.
&gt;
&gt;Suddenly the elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of the man's legs and swung him wildly back and forth along the railing, killing him.

I don't think anyone is disagreeing with that.  The problem is lack of alternative accommodation.

&gt;4) the only exception to not having to move if you are affected by this is if you have a disability that REQUIRES an extra room.

&gt;5) can't find a 1 bed flat in your area? MOVE, it's what people do.

We were on the local social housing list for nearly five years waiting for a disabled-adapted house.  We now have a spare room and the choice of either paying the additional £15 a week out of a budget that is already pared down to the basics whilst going back on the housing list and waiting another three or four years for somewhere suitable or moving to a private let (that will cost exactly the same for a three bed as we are currently paying the LHA for a four bed) that will likely not be disabled friendly, require a deposit that we can't afford and comes with  all the bullshit that goes with getting a private landlord to do anything.

The wealthiest are not receiving a cheque but a tax reduction to aid the economy. 

The purpose of social housing is not to provide affordable homes with social connotations but a factor in the private market that must be measured against other poor and vulnerable people. Homes do not exist just houses. Only them. The slightly affluent can hold these people in contempt. But there must be no mansion tax.

All pensioners regardless of wealth are exempt because they are old. Nobody else has an excuse. Everyone can pay their way. Only that way can all people solve all the problems. The poor, disabled ( mentally and physically ), and vulnerable should suck it up and pull their weight. They are the problem for the economy and housing problems.

Moving is easy, not traumatic, always suitable ( there will be no hidden social costs). Cheap and practical too.

This will cut costs by relying on the private market. Rents will be cheaper in a free market. As the remaining stocks are bought ( encouraged by the government ) people will own their own houses. Social housing is irrelevant. In times of poverty the last people to help are the worst off. The triple A rating must be protected this way.

This will cut the welfare bill because the doubling in housing benefit is matched by the 5 million to 5.5 million recipients. Private landlords will solve this. The housing shortage is the fault of welfare lifestyle choices pushing up costs.

This...

&gt;It is sticking to its plan A because spending cuts are not about deficits but about rolling back the welfare state. So no amount of evidence is going to change its position on cuts.

...is a political argument, not an ecconomic one. And this...

&gt;Yet despite the huge incentive to export created by such devaluation, Britain is still running trade deficits because it has lost the productive capacity to respond.

...is an absurd generalisation. You can't take one ecconomy and lay its failings at the feet of its Government without any reference to the rest of the world. It's like trying to figure out why a car engine won't work by only examining the spark plugs.

We are part of a system, and as such have only limited control over our future. The central problem with our exports isn't that we don't have anything to export, but that our traditional customers (eg. Europe and Ireland) are not buying due to problems with their own ecconomies, and that we only have limited traction with the BRIC nations. Any serious article about our export problems should at least mention these two factors.

Also, this...

&gt; To deal with this problem, it urgently needs to develop a long-term productive strategy through a broad-based public consultation involving not just the government and private sector firms, but trade unions, educational institutions and research institutes.

...is not a plan, its a power-point presentation. I've read any number of 'productive strategies' and ideas from smart politicians over the years, and I've yet to see one which had any practical value beyond stating (what should be to most people) common sense in the management lingo of the day.

My job was going poorly, my friends had mostly moved away and my relationship with my family had broken down to almost nothing. 

It took four visits to three separate doctors. Each time I went to the doctor I was given a questionairre and they filled in my answers. I was well in to the severely depressed category each time, and each time the response was to see how I felt in a few weeks and if things hadn't improved I was to go back. It wasn't until my ex marched in there with me and started banging on the desk that I got on a 12 week waiting list for six sessions of CBT, which were then denied because I moved to an area covered by another health trust and I had to start the process again.

true,jimofwales,cnty-wales,Cardiff,"I've been involved in energy efficiency and retrofit for a long time and nothing depresses me more than the UK housing stock and attitudes to saving energy. The underlying problem is we simply don't have the money or the skills to deal with the issue. Loft insulation is great, but to prepare for future energy costs we need to fully retrofit all the old houses in the UK. We're talking external wall insulation, floor insulation, triple glazed windows, improved airtightness, ventilation, high efficiency heating system, all done in a coherent way. Problem is such a retrofit will cost £20-50k+ per house (depending on how big the property and how bad the starting position is). The building trade know fuck all about energy efficiency, I'm astounded on a daily basis. To hit any kind of target we need to address at least the worst performing 15 million homes and who's going to pay? Folk round my way can barely afford to put the heating on let alone pay for a 50k retrofit (which they'll never see a payback on). So what's the alternative, subsidise it through energy bills? Knock the whole lot down and start again? 

Neither will happen, so it's basically extreme energy poverty for 80% of people and an ever increasing drain on the middle class who then won't be spending their money on consumer goods. 

We can and will use a lot less energy and there some huge wins that won't really affect quality of life that much in the medium term. But underheating homes brings a whole raft of other societal costs (poor health and structural decay) that will compound the misery in the longrun.

- a mortgage or private rent costs more per week for an extra bed room than this does. 

- there are always jobs, it just depends whether people are willing to do them. Many full time workers travel long distances to work in order to pay bills and afford rent/mortgage.

This is not purely what council/social homes are for. If you are poor you will have no right to community or security. The stock will diminish. Anyone who applies family values to homes must become subject to privateers, families do not count. The social aspect of human nature does not count. Only pure finance will count which we all know is such a part of nature. We all know humans evolved 200,000 years ago with hedge funds.

The whole idea of personhood and awareness comes in to it then and this is why abortion terms are set in the rest of the UK at 24 weeks. The rationale being that something which doesn't have a fully formed nervous system (http://www.secondlookproject.org/tslp_fetal.html - at 28 weeks) can't have ""feelings"" or possibly thoughts.

I doubt that, since the Liberal Party was formed from Whigs, Radicals, and Peelites to overthrow the minority Tory government. By the time they were officially known as the Liberal Party they had already won elections as the Whigs

&gt; The two party system is cyclical

The only real time a party has truly been overthrown is the Liberal Party to Labour in 1924. The changes to the Tories and Whigs were evolutionary, came from the inside of the parties, and took a number of decades to come about.

true,Draxton,null,null,"&gt;I vote UKip because the EU is quite frankly ripping us off.

In what way? Financially? Morally? Socially?

&gt;The EU keeps trying to tax our financial institutions in an effort to redistribute wealth across the EU. 

If you're referring to the proposed cap to banker's bonuses, that isn't really about 'redistributing wealth'.

&gt;When I vote UKip, that vote is to stop us throwing money into the EU that we never see again.

Apart from all the rebates of that exact same money. Plus the increased  trade leading to even more money.

&gt;The reality is, is that immigrant communities stay together in their own communities in council houses collecting benefits and see the UK as a soft touch.

You know that bit later on in this post where you claim not to be racist? Well stereotyping all 'immigrants' as stay-at-home benefit claimants makes you look a little racist. I mean you could've at least tried to rescue it with one of those ""but my Polish mate is a really hard worker"" anecdotes.

&gt;I dont like the fact that we have 'ghetto' areas in the UK.

I doubt anyone likes the areas. But 'Ghetto' areas aren't exclusively non-British areas? Lower income areas have existed for decades, far before the current immigration boom. I live in Manchester, there are plenty of suburbs around that are both low-income and largely White-British.

&gt;We need to restrict immigration to the skilled people we need who will be of benefit to us and help advance the UK.

We already have a system for skilled workers:

&gt;For the year from 6 April 2012 to 5 April 2013, a maximum of 20,700 skilled workers can come to the UK under Tier 2 (General) to do jobs with an annual salary below £150,000.

&gt;There is no limit on the number of workers coming to the UK to do jobs with an annual salary of £150,000 or above.

Though I could see why people might like changes to it. 

&gt;Everybody is so quick to say 'BUT YOURE RACIST THEN', my first blowjob was off a black girl, and shes gorgeous.

Making blanket statements =/= 'racist'. Someone who stereotypes, sure. Though making a blanket statement such as 'all immigrants collect benefits' *would* be a little bit racist.

&gt;You mean the evidence of the effects?

There will be negative effects *and* positive effects to this policy.

&gt;Because this is so going to help the massive problems of other poor people?

Some poor people will benefit from the policy. It really depends on who you define as being poor though. Which is another debate entirely.

&gt;Because this will not accelerate the demise of social housing and all that that means?

Merely considering the positive benefits will not accelerate the demise of social housing.

&gt;Because every accommodation is suitable, and they are all available all the time? That because there is a plethora of housing and other related choices? Because we should not hear the voices of the poor only others jealous of luxury council homes you so want to live in? Or their families? Related social structures? Being secure in an Englishman's home being his castle only if they are financially able to do something about circumstances? We all know that that everyone is able to change their outcomes regardless of, well, the real world? Because it doesn't set the poor against the poor enough?

true,majormantastic,null,null,"I studied Natural Sciences at Cambridge. My final grades were AAAC (before the A* A-level was introduced). I got an A in maths, further maths and physics. My C was in German.

My advice to you would be to apply. Beyond seeing that you are on track to get the minimum requirements for the course in terms of grades the next thing they're gonna look at is the diversity of your studies. I think the subjects you've picked are going to do you good in this regard. I would not recommend dropping the physics, I would recommend working hard at it to try to get the best you can in it. This might mean going above and beyond simply going to class, it might mean asking for extra help (if a teacher's nice enough to assist). No one's saying you need to get A* in it though.

The other think to consider is your personal statement. Believe it or not in some ways that may well be far more influential in getting an offer than the business about not being A* material in Physics. You have to make it stand out and be interesting. Remember there are huge numbers of applicants to Cambridge every year and reading those personal statements is a laborious task so make yours catch someone's eye. If you're at a good grammar school then I'd be very surprised if they didn't help you with this.

Another way you may increase your chances is by picking a ""sensible"" college. There will be many differing opinions on this so I won't say too much but in some regards applying for a college such as Girton directly may give you a higher chance of acceptance than applying directly to Trinity. Some colleges are hugely oversubscribed for certain courses whereas others simply don't take on that many in a certain subject. You  will need to seek advice on this at some point as from your point of view you probably haven't a clue which college is which!

Also you've not stated whether you're a guy or gal, this might be useful info.


As a side note, you wouldn't be the first person to be put off applying to Cambridge by a teacher. It enfuriates Cambridge when this occurs because often there is simply a lack of understanding from teachers of what Cambridge really wants. Take any advice to steer away from Cambridge with a pinch of salt.

The safety rating is a bit confusing now, as other people have noted, we're planning on improving it. What route did you get a red 9 on?

The routes and times are provided by the Google Maps API, and it's biking direction are still in beta, so unfortunately we have little control over it at this point. We're looking into some other solutions that may improve the pathing but for now it's a bit out of our hands.

As for the A1, it's definitely a case of just insufficient data, which we're trying to address.

- learn a new skill. There are free courses for unemployed people especially if you have few qualifications

true,PeaSouper,english,American/Canadian Expat,"&gt;If you consider brewing 10% Russian Imperial Oatmeal Stouts, and 200 IBU IPAs as progress then you can keep it.

Like I said, it's a matter of taste.  I recognize that not everyone is going to like a beer that is that aggressive.  What we were talking about here in the first place was what Americans miss about living in the UK.  I miss being able to (easily) find beers like those over here.

&gt;  We have thousands of good beer here: porters, IPAs, barley wines, old ales, burtons, stouts, best bitters, etc.

Of course there are good beers in Britain.  No one, least of all me, is disputing that that's the case.  But in the US you can find great beer in damned near any supermarket, and most bars you go into (at least where I'm from) will have at least a few craft beers on tap.  The *average* pub in England will generally have widely available ales, maybe a cider or two, and some continental lagers.  At my Tesco we've got cans of Fosters, Kronenbourg, Stella, and other boring crap.  Yes, there are exceptions, but that's the point - they're exceptions.

&gt; Have you ever been to Belgium? To Germany? They have hundreds and hundreds of beers, and many more new ones.

I'm in Brussels right now, with some reservations to pick up some Westvleteren 12 at Sint Sixtus later in the week.  Believe me, I know about Belgian brewing.  They've been making great beer here for centuries and centuries.  Yes, there are some new beers here too - but at least in my experience, most of the reverence given to Belgian beers is to the ones they've been making forever, rather than the newer ones.  And while Belgian-style beer is great, there's not a ton of variety beyond that.  Other styles of beer in Belgium aren't exactly common.

Except British Rolls Royce makes almost every aircraft engine used on every aircraft around the world, from American 747's to European Airbus A380's. BAE is the world's largest single defence company, and larger than **EVERY** American defence company, infact they look pathetic compared to what we produce. We have a massive amount of high tech industry's in the UK that are booming. These things should make you proud.

I don't buy this doom and gloom shit, as an employer in the UK the biggest issue I have is employing qualified staff, I constantly hear that tonnes of people are unemployed, yet I have some jobs advertised that are unfilled for 2 years, I could get people from the US or China to come here tomorrow to do those things. The government needs to get on a re-train and re-tool people for our new booming high tech economy, forget pathetic back to work schemes, we need hardcore education for the masses and we can have near 100% employment.

I have no problem getting money, credit, other business and contracts, from a business perspective there's more money going round now than before the recession, banks are literally throwing money at me, and especially with the low interest rates it's a great time to grow. There's more business available and customers than ever before, especially in the South Asia basin, Latin America and even in Africa, I could double the size of my business overnight if I could find the right qualified British staff. It's getting so bad I'm actually thinking of moving abroad. Not because of money, not because of regulation, not because of tax, not because of any of the other shit that the media talks about, just basic staff qualifications. I won't do that though because I'm fiercely patriotic, and I won't ever move from the UK. Just read this thread to work out why: 

http://redd.it/19yxnk

The first step to being a nation in decay is to start talking about being in decay. Do you know why America does so well and has relatively high growth levels even now during a world recession? Because they stop all the bullshit talk about the world ending, behave optimistically and just get on with it. We need to stop this doom and gloom, the good times will come back as soon as we say they have come back, it's literally that easy. People start being imaginative again, new ideas crop up, businesses start, employment gets going, business booms, tax intake increases, everyone is happy. It's up to the average person, no amount of subsidies, bail outs or QE can make that happen.

From now on boycott newspapers that brainwash your mind with doom and gloom, see what a difference it makes to your life.

* A younger centre half is urgent as Heitinga can fuck off and the side is too old.
* Jelavic needs real competition as Big Vic is too injury prone and Jelavic just looks lost.
* Fellaini can fuck off as well if he's gonna have a hissyfit when the shit hits the fan. Your not bigger than the club.
* Some new wingers would be nice or at least lets have a look at Kennedy. Naismith is not an acceptable level of competition for Pienaar and Mirallas.

/rant

*Edit: The only problem is finding a manager who can take us to that next level and is affordable. Moyes offers comfort but is that enough for another 10 years? Unfortunately money is the big issue here because as it stands we'll have to take another gamble on a manager from a club below us. Whether Martinez is the answer I'm not sure but he seems the best candidate within the Premier League that would be willing to move.

BASC statement:

http://www.basc.org.uk/en/media/key_issues.cfm/cid/BAD4A4CA-5CDF-406D-8BF6AFBAC8C63188

&gt;It is clear from the evidence presented by firearms licensing staff that Durham police must bear responsibility for the fact that Michael Atherton had access to guns. The police had the legal power and should have acted to permanently remove those guns on reports of Atherton’s violence, alcohol abuse and threats of suicide. There were several clear opportunities for this tragedy to have been prevented. Durham police have broken the bond of trust which exists between the public and the police in the administration of the UK’s firearms law.
After this tragedy we have to ask ourselves if 43 different police forces operating different systems with no common training or standards and varying interpretations of government guidance is the right way to protect public safety and ensure efficient licensing.

NRA UK (From facebook):

&gt;No Need for Review of Firearms Licensing
NRA Response to Cleveland Coroner
Recent calls for a review of firearms licensing have been made by the coroner after ruling that three women were unlawfully killed in County Durham.
The killer, Michael Atherton, had legally owned weapons despite a history of domestic abuse.
The case highlights failings not in firearms licensing legislation but failings with implementation. This was recognised by Michael Banks, Durham’s Deputy Chief Constable, who stated “If we were presented with the same facts today… (Michael Atherton’s) licence would not be granted….if there's any intelligence around domestic violence in the family setting or intemperate behaviour then there is a presumption that a firearms licence or shotgun certificate will not be granted"".
Local police firearms officers work hard and generally deliver a highly professional service with rigorous scrutiny for firearm applications and renewals.
UK firearms legislation is recognised as some of the most restricted in the world; and the UK system is widely held across Europe to be an exemplar for responsible and safe firearms ownership.
The granting of a firearm certificate is wholly at the discretion of the police who need to be confident that the applicant is responsible and poses no risk to the public. 
Applicants are obliged to justify good reason to own a rifle; provide independent character referees; be checked for criminal records; give consent for police to question their GP for evidence of alcoholism, drug abuse or personality disorders; and provide evidence of specialist secure storage for their rifle.
Shooting is a legal and major participation sport in the UK, and today over 700,000 certificates are granted covering 1.8m rifles and shotguns.
The incidence of legally held firearms being used in criminal activity is very rare, hence the keen media interest in such stories. The comparative statistics for knife crime are astonishing – in the year to June 2012 there were 29,613 recorded offences involving knives and other sharp objects. This supports the National Rifle Association’s long held view that it is the person not the weapon that causes harm and that the current firearm legislation, properly implemented, continues to deliver safety and protection to the public.

My takeaway from their whole discussion was that the only hope for a team lies in the boardroom and not on the field/sidelines. I'd rather dip my toes in trophies and glory from time to time based on hard work and integrity, than bathe in trophies and glory that we're bought and paid for.

Put number into this http://www.dslchecker.bt.com/adsl/adslchecker.welcome and if it comes back with the following message - *There is no data available for this number. This could be either because it is not a BT line or it is a new BT number that has just been provided. Most new numbers will appear on the checker 24 hours after BT has installed the line.* then the line has to be reverted back to BT before being taken over, the reasoning is that each ISP has a number of CLI's to use, these are their own CORE numbers and tend not to be switched when changing service providers.

Plusnet will need to perform several requests on your line. First is a import and conversion of the line back to the BT network. This can be rejected by the prior supplier, though normally only due to validation errors.


However, you don’t have to necessarily switch back to BT. Ofcom, the telecommunications regulator said that it is up to the consumer which provider they want to switch to, however not all communications providers will offer the opportunity to switch over an LLU customer, even though they can.

true,Leonichol,cnty-uk,Geordie in exile (Surrey),"- Cynicism. After such a long time in America, it is nice to have people a little more down to earth. Not everything is amazing, super, or awesome... brah.

- Sarcasm. I can say the complete opposite of what I mean and people will understand. Bonus points if the intended (superior, non-native) recipient isn't sure and everyone else is cracking up.

- Some amazing comedy. Well ranging and catering for all types.

- Access to some amazing landscapes. The ability to just uproot and buzz off to a tent on a hill with no noise.

- Extremely multicultural. I can walk across the street and learn about everything from suburban Gdansk to the slums of Delhi. Can also buy all sorts of weird questionably digestive nonsense which is a new experience. 

- Amazing high quality TV production and creative industries.

- Unbiased high quality news.

- Infinite jobs in *my* industry.

- I can go pretty much anywhere without hassle. And airports everywhere with cheap flights.

- If I am ill or lose my job, it isn't the end of the world as the Government will help me out until I am back on my feet

- I can buy pretty much any type of product. It will be available somewhere without import duty.

- I have access to the entire EU to work and play.

- Accents. If I get sick of Southerners it's a 30minute train journey to a reasonable person.

- Beaches. We have loads of them. And they're pretty amazing... in the summer.

- Well built houses (if somewhat small). We don't make shit out of wood everywhere.

- Can speak with almost everyone everywhere in my native tongue. If not they seem to understand when I say it slower and louder.

- I am safe. Even in central Woking I can leave my garage open and nothing is going to happen to the contents or me.

- Anywhere else in the world, my accent enacts a natural deference in the subject.

- I can say something someone likes is shit without people taking it extremely personally.

- We are not massively enthusiastic about some guy in the sky, and make everything about it.

- As long as I stay out of London, nothing is going to try kill me.",0,1362848576,null,0,false,0,c8sme3w,t3_19yxnk,t1_c8sme3w,t3_19yxnk,null,1431532594,17,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,17

The thing is that I have a few concerns with having a gap year.

I've looked on Oxford's website and it appears that it would be best to have the academic references from the uni that you're at.

The thing is though, apparently LSE really hates their first year students (re)applying to Oxford. So it'll be unwise / impossible to get a reference from an academic tutor at LSE.

That leaves Lucas, who's good, and who I think will do a decent job, but Lucas is much better (IMO) at tracking players who rely on good ball handling and look to pass (see, eg, Silva) than he is at neutralizing pacey players who like to shoot, like Bale.

The other thing is, no matter how we choose to cover Bale, we'll have to leave gaps in our defense in other places if we do pressure him, and Lennon especially would worry me in that situation.

Also, I'm a guy haha. 

Thanks. I've been looking at colleges, but honestly I think I've probably got the wrong idea. I'm a very social person so my favoured ones would be those more difficult to get into, but with more people (Trinity, King's, etc.). Thanks for pointing that out about what to apply for though. I'll certainly look into it when I go to the open day(s).

My teacher did say ""We can't stop you from applying and I'm not trying to tell you otherwise, but you have to be realistic"". The thing is, he applied to Oxford (I think) and got rejected and he said he didn't want me to have to go through that. Honestly though, I think you guys in this thread are right. I should apply, because I'll have 4 other Unis who hopefully want to take me on, and I am very thick skinned.
