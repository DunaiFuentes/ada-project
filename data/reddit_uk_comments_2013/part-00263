Looked for takeaway.com's number, they didn't have any contact number, So i emailed them explaining what happened.

within 15-20Mins i got a phone call from takeaway.com, explaining that the employees gave the same attitude to her too, She then told me that she spoke to the manager and the employees had been told off :/.


I told her i don't want the pizza anymore, especially from that place (even though they have lovely pizza) and she told me she can give me a refund if i gave my ibann etc as i paid through bitcoin.


I just told her leave it just tell them to send the pizza over anyway,

Driver came in 30 minutes, asked me if i paid, had to show him the email on my laptop to reassure him :/ He apologized and said a lot of fake orders had come from takeaway.com, i told him to fuck off and gave no tip.

1. Lennon has already played 154+ minutes this week.  Considering how much we obviously need to keep him healthy as our only true wide option at RW, I don't want his dodgy hamstrings playing 200+ minutes in 7 days. 
 
2. Jan picked up a knock last match; plus, he has already played 180+ minutes this week, and not as a centerback -- he's been carrying his sizable frame up and down the left side of the pitch all game long.  And the 71 minute rest he had against Tromso was the only break he's had from playing LB *twice per week* for club and country since **October 15**!

So I would do everything possible to give these two a rest, and Walker too.  But we need CB power and aerial strength against Fletcher and Altidore.  And we'll need defensive help from our wingers if we don't play Jan and Walker.

Sigs is begging for an opportunity at 10, and lamela and towny are on the verge of breaking out, I can feel it. Soldado wants to score a goal now that he cant score his pregnant wife (can u have a sex with a pregnant woman or will u accidently poke the baby?). Capoue needs to find his form, and this lineip is a great ipportunity for him. I hope fryers impresses against PL opponents. I would prefer Vert sit out, so if walker is playing then i suppose my main man naghton can play on the left IF AND ONLY IF left footed towny plays there too. I strictly apologize, I started the prematch drun  thed very early. I will try not to do this in the future. I am just so excited and want the very best for these fellas and AVB

Baines doesn't need to do anything at all to prove his worth before January, the best thing for him would be to play zero games, which is probably what's going to happen, so he can't mess it up, and he's worth what, £40M?  If Oviedo has a couple of bad games it will appear like we really need Baines after all and that will raise his price.  United basically want our star player, so they will have to pay megabucks, and they are willing.  I've been saying this for a while, Baines to United in January for £30M plus Fellaini.  Call me bonkers in the head, but that's my prediction.

That would leave us needing a left-footed defender, bearing in mind that both Oviedo and Distin can play left back.  Plenty of time in January or summer to get a replacement.

We have such great squad depth and quality right now, it seems to good to be true.  I think Europe is crucial this year for financial reasons.  Barring some miracle, we can't keep up this level of a team without results.  We don't have the mass support outside of Merseyside like some clubs do e.g. South East Asia.  We don't have the ticket and merchandise sales of the Uniteds and Arsenals, so we can't compete for the best players forever.  What we have is great support, great community, a great footballing city where players love their life and want to stay (e.g. Pienaar coming back from Spurs).  Having said that I don't know much about Everton's finances - what does Kenwright have up his crafty sleeve?

Actually I'm not sure Fellaini really wants to come back yet, he's not homesick just yet and he's not needed unless McCarthy disappoints and Barkley transfers in January.  Might have to wait until the summer.

I introduced her to 11's first appearance with little Emilia and prisoner zero. (It was on tv couldn't help it.) 
So heres my thinking:
Start from rose and ecclstin?
Start from christmas regeneration with tennant? 
Finish out 11 and do a prequal type story telling marathon like where we came from while we wait on cupaldi? 
Or open to suggestions
She likes it but looking for the series of episodes where she loves it!
So:
9 10 11?
10 11 9?
11 9 10? 
Or specific episodes?
Sorry if this is all over the place.

BRT is effectively ""road trams"".

* Stations (passengers pay prior to boarding, wait away from the weather for a bus to arrive)
* Multiple carriages (just as likely to get a seat, multiple points for passengers to board and alight the vehicle)
* Mixture of on-street and dedicated running, much like trams. Journey times are therefore comparable in urban areas/regions.
* Vehicles specifically designed to be comfortable and can look good also (see the BRT in Metz, France).

Further benefits:

* Possible to trial routes with limited costs
* Route around obstructions such as road traffic accidents, fallen trees, flooding. A tram is restricted by its nature (i.e. rails)
* Cheaper, and why would any taxpayer want their money squandered?

From what I can tell, Tim Cahill is a star player at New York, although that's a lower level;  he is pretty old after all.

Apart from that you're right.  Perhaps you could say that Arsenal play similar football to Everton so that's why Arteta adjusted well. 

As one of the almost-top teams in the country, we're not going to sell great players without a good reason.  Lescott was a bit of a mystery.  At the time, playing for City was very prestigious and Everton were regarded as a middling team.  Moyes did a great job of getting a good price for him.  Moyes's ambition was to keep Lescott but Lescott wanted to go, Moyes did really well to get excellent money for him and you could say that enabled him to improve the team even further.

So to conclude, we only let players go for huge money.  Simple as that.  Had Rodwell stayed, he might not be playing.  It's the big teams who try to buy success, probably because their owners see us on the TV and pick and choose their favourites, and the manager has to obey.  Everton make well scouted, intelligent signings and we pay the right price.  If other teams want to pay silly money, that's their choice.  In the meantime we will happily be a selling club like Arsenal.  People said that Arsenal were being unambitious by selling their best players year after year, but look at them now.  It's simply financial mathematics.  If you can't be bothered to scout smaller teams, then you'll end up buying a player from a big team, and we don't really want to sell.  Like Gareth Bale.  Here's the conversation between Real Madrid and Spurs:

Real Madrid:  ""I heard Gareth Bale is good, we'll give you £5M for him""

Spurs:  "" We don't want to sell him, we want to win the league, go away""

Real: ""How about £10M""

Spurs:  ""We don't want to sell him, he's our best player""

Real:  Throws a tantrum

Spurs:  ""Look, if you really want to know how much he's going to cost, we'll sell him to you for £10,000,000,000,000,000,000""

Spurs:  (Thinks:  Maybe they will leave us alone now)

Real Madrid:  ""OK!""

Something being 'insulting', however, is silly. Surely that's just down to how much the victim wants to make a fuss? Also wouldn't the insult actually have to be directed towards someone? I don't think that being offended is the same as being insulted. 

With both of your examples I can see why that would be insulting, due to it being seemingly directed to the reader/hearer. Surely something less directive like wearing a shirt saying 'Shitty Fucking Knickers' or something would be offensive rather than insulting.

Price... we will be lucky to get 25. He is 29 and still has a couple of years of his prime but I don't see him keeping the same level of attacking play for 4-5 more years. 

The money in our pocket would be the best outcome here, do some good bringing in another quality Lb such as caliber or Oviedo. I absolutely love Leighton. Seeing him go will hurt but it is for the betterment of the club in the future. We can survive without him and the money will help us build a bigger and better squad. 

I don't think Fellaini is heading back anytime soon. He still hasn't settled in there. Phil Nev said recently he isn't being his self since he arrived. He will get there though and he will be a damn good holding mid for them. 

Barkely will not leave in January. He wants to play in the world cup and to do so he will need playing time. Not many other teams are going to let a 20 year old run out week after week to make mistakes to learn from them. We would be insane to sell him this soon. His potential is outstanding. 

We haven't seen Bobby work in a window and to see what deals he can try to make happen outside raiding Wigan and getting some loans. (quality loans at that) I have high hopes. He is a class manager and with the way we are playing a not a push over. This will help when trying to get people to come to your club, and we play beautiful football.

And more on the ending of the 50th: Even him never having blown up Gallifrey according to the 11th (as, again, he is the only one of the Doctors who remembers) doesn't change the fact that he did, in fact, still kill many people when he fought in the Time War.

true,amberoid,null,null,"Baines coming forward and linking with Pienaar was Moyes's stroke of genius and there is an almost telepathic link between Baines and Pienaar but Oviedo has shown that the attacking left-back role can be played by others than Baines.

We're absolutely not a one-man team.  Leighton has incredible intelligence and that more than makes up for his short height.  Again, the fact that Oviedo can suddenly slot in so well proves that the backbone and shape of the team is much more than just Baines (noting that Oviedo has had a year of training to get to know his teammates).

Losing Baines right now would be a bad hit for morale, but over the next month the players' feelings will become clear.  A lot depends on what Baines decides, and he probably hasn't made up his mind yet.  £25M would only be accepted if he wanted to go - but why would he want to go to United, in lower league position, unless they were offering megabucks?  Bearing in mind that a) he's a Scouser and b) he's settled.  It's not the same as the Rooney transfer when United was Rooney's ticket to the Champions League final (Rooney loves Everton).  Although if Leighton left in January, I guess he would get a chance at the Champions League final this year, if not next year.

I too am interested to see what Bobby's going to do in January.  I don't think Moyes has the balls to be aggressive like Sir Alex used to be.  Moyes messed up pretty badly in the summer, we took him to the cleaners for Fellaini and that comes down to the senior management's lack of respect for him.  Moyes plays the underdog role well but he is not suited to the Big Man/King/Godfather/Best Manager In The World role, if you see what I'm getting at.  He doesn't have the self-belief.  This is being passed on to his players, they're crumbling like a pack of cards (what a rubbish metaphor) under the anxiety and nervousness.

We do indeed play beautiful football, I say I say I say (Fred from Corrie) they're a grand team to support.

I couldn't understand how any system based on skin colour could be fair and how such an obvious injustice could be let to exist.   I was a teenager at the time and had fairly clear, if not fully informed, views. 
At the time the conservative government did not support the use of sanctions.  I thought this was wrong and that we should have been using every thing in our power to change the situation. Thatcher viewed Mandela as a terrorist and the ANC a terrorist organisation. I didn't, I saw them as freedom fighters. 
This was a period when a Tory MP called for Mandela to be shot. 
So while I won't use it as a way to bash the current Tory government I do think it should be remembered that not everyone thought he was a hero. 
In Cameron's defence I will add that about 10 years ago he stated that the old Tory views were wrong and asked for those who held them to rethink and change. So while there were views which we now think are almost unthinkable I personally don't think Cameron was or is now as extreme in his views as some of his party members.

 1. You're absolutely right - Mandela did indeed set up a military wing to the ANC and they saw their role as being to fight for freedom - yes, with firearms, bombs etc.  South Africa may have had a shocking interior policy at the time, but it was a reasonably stable government and it's quite unusual for one stable government to stand on a platform against another.
 1. I don't think the Tories could have taken the ""Mandela is right! Release Mandela!"" attitude at the time because it would have completely contradicted their own Northern Ireland policy - many of the senior members of Sinn Feinn at the time had convictions for terrorism dating back to the 1970's. Thatcher was very keen on the ""We will not negotiate with terrorists"" rhetoric - which inevitably posed a bit of a problem when about 80% of the people who might otherwise be qualified to sit at the negotiating table had convictions for terrorism.


Note I am not talking about whether Mandela was right or wrong - I think it's fairly obvious that the South African government at the time was not exactly a bastion of freedom for all - simply the fact that his tactics were never going to win him friends in the Conservative party of the 1980s.",0,1386325894,null,0,false,0,cduy9ki,t3_1s8f9w,t1_cduy9ki,t1_cduxz7b,null,1428370808,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

[the Facebook page of the 'stop privatization of sussex' movement](https://www.facebook.com/groups/407080325992943/?fref=ts) (i.e. where all the key information within the group gets published). I believe it's public to look at but i might be wrong.

Their [twitter](https://twitter.com/Occupy_Sussex)

Their [Wordpress blog](http://sussexagainstprivatization.wordpress.com/)



To give my very, very brief (and totally biased and coloured, and possibly wrong in places, please DO bear this in mind) summary of it all as a sussex student:

The students (and there is a rather sizeable group of them, not just this 5) have been protesting for quite a while against the gradual privatization of campus services (porters in halls of residence, catering providers, security personal, etc.) by the university management. There are about 235 jobs at risk as a result of this decision, though many might be hired back. It is thought the main reason behind the uni's desire to do this is that if they sell the contracts to a private company, that private company can then effectively fire and re-hire their employees, meaning the people who work on campus could be paid less, but crucially will have benefits/pension plans cut (Under current 'public-sector-ish' contracts, they actually get a decent amount of security etc). The university management is also unpopular for a variety of other poor decisions it's made, which generally revolve around the gradual movement towards make the university more 'businesslike'. Student dissatifaction with them is pretty high, and sussex has dropped a lot of places in the leauge tables over the last 2 years.

Sussex is always prone to protests and such, this movement specifically surrounding hte privatization has been going since about this time last year. Most of the serious stuff revolves around the 'occupations' and the occupaitons tend to revolve around the universities conference centre in bramber house (one of the campus buildings). The occupy-students target this because it's a place they feel they can settle in that causes financial damage to the university (they hire it out at prettty high rates) and doesn't harm other students (there are no lectures or classes there).

Last year there was a very lengthy occupation of of the conference centre (3 months maybe?), punctuated by a big protest in which students were invited and bussed in from other universities to protest against the privatization of services in public universities. That protest went awry when some students (not sure where from) decided to smash in the doors of the management building on campus, and burn some random files in the street outside. Shortly afterwards the university successfully managed to evict the students under a court order that banned anyone from coming on to campus or remaining there with the intention of protesting. (technically against the Human rights act, but there we go).

The court case for the last occupation is still ongoing at this point i believe, the occupation these students were suspended for was very recent. It appears overnight suddenly, the university got a court order to evict them VERY quickly, and i believe that the students actually all left shortly after. (as a kind of 'fuck you you cant do what you tell me'  - waste the uni's time and money getting them to draw up court things that they then can't use).



That's about all the sum/history i can give off the top of my head, but perhaps OP, or those links i provided could shed some more light on it for you. If you also google around, there were a lot of stories published on various news websites surrounding last years events, and i believe one or two on this suspension too.

Suarez is leaving in the summer, there's no question about it. 60-90 mil is enough to purchase some extremely solid players no matter the position we're in. 

Our main problem is our lack of depth, especially in midfield. We're leaking goals at the back, but that's because our midfield is getting caught out a little too easy.

Henderson just isn't good enough in my opinion. The amount of chances he's had to put it in the back of the net this season is a infuriating.

I think most of the problems that come with it are really just highlighting problems that exist anyway that we seem incapable of making long-term plans for. I'm thinking particularly of housing policy. Or rather, the complete lack of a housing policy that we've had for at least the last 40 years which has allowed house prices to rise and rise, and the social housing stock to get smaller and smaller.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"It's a false dilemma.  

You can have good immigration and bad immigration.  You can have a bit of both and have good net immigration, with a net positive effect, or you can have bad net immigration, with a net negative effect.  It has nothing to do with race, origin, or ethnicity, it has everything to do with skills, numbers and integration.

That is not to say that bad immigration is a result of a bad immigrant.  It might be that the services or infrastructure need time to catch up so they can be in place to deal with more.  It might be that there's an overabundance of labour; and whilst the immigrant is paying taxes, a great worker, over qualified, a reliable family man, and able to support his family on less,  the person that was otherwise able to do the position he filled is unemployed and unable to contribute.  The extra labour might push wages closer to the minimum, or to more zero hour contracts.  In all of these cases the immigrant has done nothing wrong per se, but the effect of his immigration can't be viewed without looking at the potential collateral harm it has caused across the wider field.

On the flip side an immigrant may appear; take more pressure off the infrastructure and services than they ever apply themselves as an individual through using them (by being a doctor or engineer, for example), create jobs or trade (by setting up a business or through innovation), or fill positions which weren't being filled to a high standard (greater efficiency/ providing specialised and sought after skills), and overall be a catalyst to national or regional growth.

All these things are intuitive.  A population of 100 million is too much; 1 million and we'd be empty.  Likewise a school needs children in the classes to justify having a local school with classrooms and a teacher, but too many children in the school and things go awry.  You can apply the same analogy to roads, doctor's surgeories, whatever.   

The argument is being falsely framed around a dichotomy that you either open up the doors and take in all the good and the bad, or you close up entirely and hide behind the curtains.  In reality you simply need a *control* that is applied to all, equally and fairly, with regularly reviewed annual limits to allow forward planning of services and infrastructure.",0,1386328106,null,0,1386336972,0,cduykde,t3_1s8h4m,t1_cduykde,t3_1s8h4m,null,1428370389,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

McGann's doctor was dying, on the brink of regeneration, the strange temple women gave him some Time Lordy drink to allow him to pick the attributes of his regeneration.

When he regenerated, it wasn't a full regeneration because nothing happened to Hurt's doctor that would make him have to regenerate as soon as he flew away at the end of the 50th. The drink McGann's doctor drank just used up the last of that cycle's power and then Hurt's doctor died of his injuries from crashing into the planet as McGann's doctor.

Sorry not true. That's a line common amongst the left as it's an easy line to make fun of. The minimum wage (along with government top ups) is the baseline that we as a civilisation hold for our citizens. 

We say bang, give this man X per hour even if he's only cleaning bogs, pulling pints or in a factory and he should be able to have a reasonable life.
 
If you have an element of society that is desperate enough to do more for less it reduces the current workers ability to barter for better wages, ask for fairer working conditions or unionise effectively. 

Now - you might think ""I'm in my office job so it doesn't affect me"". Yet it does because this is the minimum standard and we all benefit by having a more wealthy middle and working class. The working classes especially as they spend most of what they earn. Societies with deep inequality have the most problems that is just plain fact.

But the timber floor is something you can work with.  Buy yourself a load of this:

Get under your floor and wedge it between the joists.  It's an ugly, dirty job but it will raise the temperature of your floor by at least a couple of degrees.  And it's pretty cheap to do, I managed to insulate the floor at the back of my house for only about £100.  No tools required, other than a cheap saw.  Also, you can insulate your downstairs ceiling quite easily, just by removing the upstairs carpets and boards and stuffing the insulation in.

I don't want to have children, partially because I never have, and partially because I don't really want to bring them into the world I expect we'll see in the years to come. I predict absolute global corruptoin of the worst kind, with civil liberties eroded away ever so slightly. I predict a median income, at best, and an impossible task of saving enough to live on when I am old. I will not have the support of the government, because I am of the generation that does not vote in their favour. I see getting to my thirties or forties and never owning a house; I see death approaching me and tapping me on the shoulder, when right now it feels a million miles away, and being faced with the reality of a miserable onward struggle. I see hardship for my whole life.

That isn't to say there won't be things that will elevate me above all of that. I will form strong bonds with people I meet, learn a fucktonne throughout my career, have enough money to cover the things I want like holidays and a hobby, so I am luckier than most. I think that in my own little bubble I will be relatively happy; it's when I look outside that, at the bigger picture, that my stomach starts to turn and I begin to feel like if I looked at it for any longer I might be consumed by it.

Which is why I don't think about it. I live every day a little bit more, a little bit happier, than the day before. I look forward to Christmas, to birthdays, to seeing my family. And when they are dead and gone and I am alone, I will turn to inner peace, deep thought, until it carries me off to my grave. I'm okay with that.

As for saving for retirement; the earlier you start, the easier it becomes. Pension schemes are shit, but I think they're better than nothing. That's down to personal opinion, of course.

true,Miserygut,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;I do also have concerns about those whom don't attempt to integrate fully. Instead expanding ghetto regions.

I think this is the crux of nearly every immigration debate in the UK. Our integration policy is *worse than terrible*, it may as well be non-existent.

Without a prevailing cultural hegemony in an area (or rather, a desirable cultural hegemony) people have trouble settling into an area by 'joining' the mass of others. The saying ""When in Rome, do as the Romans do"" is reflective of the positive aspects of joining a large monoculture - you get to fit in and enjoy all the benefits of being a 'native'. That's not to say that you'll instantly give up being the person you currently are, but that you'll also include that more general culture into your person, that's what being British / French / American / Egyptian / Iranian / Chinese in another country is.

As an added point, I would say that people who actively foster and encourage *minorities* to force their own cultures onto the larger societal culture is actively harming the society. It's not the natural way that societies assimilate non-natives and actively creates a 'them and us' culture which is precisely what you want to avoid. It breeds a false sense of legitimacy to cultural memes that might be undesirable to the society, and that will result in conflict (For instance, Homosexuality is fine in the UK, not in other countries.). Let a society assess the merits of a culture for what they are, not because we're forced to, eg, Homosexuality is actually fine, it just took a long time to realise.

So, I'm pretty sure that the concept of Silence Falling predates the religious order known as the Silence, so it's unlikely that it refers directly to the order, but more likely to another event.

....Unless... somebody very clever with a vendetta against the Silence, and possibly a blue box, went back and planted the idea.

Without *Safe Harbor*, transferring personal data to the US is illegal.

I suspect that the prosecution argument will go something like: defendant signed the *Safe Harbor* agreement, but failed to abide by it. Therefore the transfer of plaintiff's data to the US was illegal. Therefore damages.

(I'm not sure that national security would come into it. There is a national security exception to the DPA, but I don't think there is such an exception to *Safe Harbor*. So even if UK gov were to say the data breach was in the interests of national security, I suspect the terms of *Safe Harbor* would still have been breached.

I've chosen to self-pension by going into property rentals in partnership with my bro.

We figured out that a mortgage is cheaper than a pension fund (especially when there's rental income to help offset it). After 10-15 years when the mortgage is paid there'll be a continuous revenue stream which can be put toward paying off the mortgage on a second rental property twice as quickly. Once the second is paid off then for the third you'll have three lots of rental income and will pay it off thrice as quick (it's not as simple as this, but you get the idea).

By the time you have 10, with 9 fully paid up you should be able to cover the full cost of the 10th mortgage in only a few years.

Our plan is to only ever be paying off one BTL mortgage at once and to pour all the combined rental income into it, plus whatever we can afford to. We figure that the main mistake most buy-to-let landlords make is overextending themselves and borrowing too much on too many properties at once, so we want to try and avoid that.

Then, when it comes time to retire we can stop buying more and hopefully have enough continuous revenue to employ someone to manage everything and retire on the rental income.

We currently have one rental fully paid off (a house my bro bought at 18 and has never lived in), and another which is a dilapidated barn we got planning permission to convert, and I'm (slowly) converting myself.

Gallifrey was always hidden, yes, but the Moment didn't create a Timelock, that happened way earlier, possibly by either the Daleks or Timelords themselves or otherwise an outside force.

At any rate, the Timelock was still in place. It's in fact a key factor in the 50th because they reason that the Moment has allowed them through the Timelock. In other words, the Timelock already exists at this point. And the Doctors aren't at all surprised about that.

Since the Moment hadn't truly been used yet, this means that the Timelock isn't part of it. All the Moment would do is to destroy a large part of space.

However, we don't know exactly when it was put in place. Therefore the Emperor of the Daleks probably got flung back in time before the Time Lock and the Cult of Skarra probably escaped before that point as well, taking with them the Genesis Ark.

&gt;Contributing to society is clearly not a prerequisite for residency. 

Without a clearly defined social contract, it depends on what your definition of a society is. We contribute in different ways. I don't think I want to live in a society where people do not contribute (however impossible that may be).

&gt;There are plenty of British people who don't contribute

There is a not single person who has indirectly not contributed. Even if it means just giving the nurse more practice when they broke their arm, or chatted with a person on the street.

Absolutely. This is what we discuss when we talk about social contracts. What *do* people find acceptable?

Heck, if you assume the Time Cracks were an accident due to not understanding the effects of what happened, the Pandorica incident looks like a ""peaceful"" attempt to stop the Doctor.  Seal him in a safe he can't escape and destroy the last known reliable time machine.  It just went wrong.

The Doctor even comments that the Silent ships look like attempts to mimic the Tardis.  Not just in effects, but in the inside too.  As if they were knowledgeable about what the interior should look like when they shouldn't be.

In light of Series 7, motives aside, are what the Silents doing any different than the Doctor did to himself?  Drops in, changes things, gives suggestions, vanishes, and erases himself from events.  Still, if you know what to look for you can tell he was around.  The Silent's power is psychic and they dress is business/power implying suits and seemingly erase themselves from the scene when they are done.  The Doctor uses psychic paper to give the appearance of power/rank when needed.

It's something I've been thinking about since Demon's Run and began to suspect since Name of the Doctor.  The Silents/Silence may be the Doctor's army described in NotD.  Much like how the Tesslect tried to do good in their own way that the Doctor disagreed with, the Silence after Eleven's fall resorted to actions he wouldn't approve of to try to save their leader/hero.

true,ParanoidPete,null,null,"So massive foreign investment is pushing up house prices in London making it unaffordable for most in the city and this article hints that taxing foreign investment in buying houses here would damage the Affordable homes market.

Affordable homes are required in any development over 30 homes to the tune of around 25-30% of those developed, this obligation can be dispensed with in certain cases if they pay extra section 106 contributions. 

The affordable homes market right now in Tower Hamlets is unaffordable to the majority of residents who reside in the borough. They are unaffordable due to them still being linked to the market rates, minimum income guarantees etc, which no one can afford.  These unaffordable Affordable homes are then sold to housing associations who then rent them out at up to 80% of market rent still unaffordable to local residents. Long term Residents in Tower Hamlets, families, communities etc have been completely wiped out in the last few years as a direct result of this. Adding to the fact that those in work are encouraged, told that because they work they dont qualify immediately for social housing no matter their circumstances. 

Homes are being snapped up like wildfire in Tower Hamlets (all bought from plans, before built etc). A large portion of these are being bought up by investors who then rent them back to the council for social tenants without going through the council waiting list. Bringing a new influx of desperate students, working and lower class people from other areas not the borough itself. The rents on these buy to let properties are always at the maximum rent the council will pay which for 1 bedroom or even bedsit is around £250 pw. Current private letting housing benefit at present in Tower Hamlets is twice as much as council and housing association housing benefit claims combined. 
 
Met an American citizen recently who was renting as a disabled tenant through the housing benefit scheme a private buy to let property. When asked exactly where he came from he replied ""Hackney"". How the hell did he qualify?

So what we're left with is a system that builds affordable homes based on the fact that private investment in the housing market is needed to achieve this. This foreign investment demand is pushing market rates through the roof thereby making the Affordable Housing market an unaffordable impossibility . 

And as i already stated communities that span generations have now been utterly destroyed because of this form of gentrification..

you are thinking of the blocks of copyright sites - i wasnt. The IWF blacklist is used by every ISP in the country without them taking any action whatsoever, its all automatic. All it would take is adding the companies domains to that list and they'll be blocked nationwide within minutes, its trivial to do , and doesnt require any legal justification as the IWF isnt a government body. There's already a precendent for this;

&gt;Originally formed to police suspected child pornography online, the IWF's remit was later expanded to cover criminally obscene material

from the wikipedia page for IWF
&gt; It states that its remit is ""to minimise the availability of 'potentially criminal' Internet content

yes but the legal standing *does not matter* when you are talking about things between different countries because there is no overriding authority that can force both parties to settle the dispute.

true,multijoy,eng-Surrey,Surrey,"I almost don't know where to begin!

&gt; First, there's no such thing as 'common law'. There's law and legal precedent. 

I think this lack of common law might come as a surprise to the courts, who have got quite used to applying the principles and developing it since the fifteenth century or so. In fact, you might want to have a word with the CPS about it, seeing as their [pages](http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/self_defence/) (which I quote from extensively) are riddled with references to the common law. 

&gt;The police have strict guidelines about use of reasonable force based on both of these things.

I am fully aware of this, and I suspect I am probably better versed in these guidelines then you are. But if I can refer m'learned friend to the principles of self defence as per Palmer v R, [1971] AC:

*""If there has been an attack so that self defence is reasonably necessary, it will be recognised that a person defending himself cannot weigh to a nicety the exact measure of his defensive action. If the jury thought that that in a moment of unexpected anguish a person attacked had only done what he honestly and instinctively thought necessary, that would be the most potent evidence that only reasonable defensive action had been taken ...""*

You will note that if someone  has just been struck (as the video appears to show, as foreshortened as it may be), the law provides that the individual may retaliate; and this may well be instinctive. I would suggest that a single strike in response to an attack is far from disproportionate. Had the officer stepped forward and continued an attack then he would have clearly been in the wrong. But he didn't.

Even if his assailant hadn't struck him, the officer still has the right in law to make a preemptive strike if has the honest held belief that he is about to come to harm. Ideally, he should have pushed him away, but neither of us were the there and the video fails to show any context to the actions. 

&gt;In this incident, there was no attempt to restrain or control the person that was attacked, which is what should have happened had he done anything materially against the law - or given reasonable grounds to suspect that he was about to do so.

That we can see from the video that has been cut to start from the officer's actions, not the assailant's. I wonder exactly how you would have expected the officer to restrain or control the assailant? A squirt of CS? A baton strike? Possibly even the discharge of a taser? All valid options.

&gt;If a police officer can say, with supporting evidence that a court would accept, that he she was in fear for their life or the lives of others, then they are supposed to 'hit as hard as they can'. 

Unmitigated bollocks. You're going have to COGFO (Cite or GTFO).

&gt;That does not mean squaring up and lashing out with fists like that.

How do you know he was squaring up to him? As far as I can see, from the video we have both seen, the officer appears to have moved forwards in response to something that we cannot see, delivers a single strike of some description and retreats.

&gt;If the bloke that was hit had done something wrong, the copper should have put cuffs on him and had him removed to somewhere that the incidence could be investigated. 

Did you know that the moment you take your cuffs out, all people suddenly become compliant and offer you their wrists, often muttering something like ""it's a fair cop, I'll come quietly guv""?

That is true. BUT, it doesn't apply to any company that **doesn't operate in Europe**.

Just because Microsoft has a presence in Europe, does not mean it is automatically responsible for the actions of its USA counterpart, as the USA company is **organisationally seperate**.

I think you are getting confused because the names are similar, so let me draw you a related scenario with the names changed.

Bobsfarm sells Oranges, out of its office in Maryland, USA. People in the UK buy these Oranges from its website, which it ships to the UK. It is found these Oranges contain lead. However the British authorities can do absolutely nothing about it other than advise people to stop buying them.

One day, Bobsfarm decides to open an office in Italy to sell Apples. It does this through creating an entirely new company in Italy which it funds and owns as its only major shareholder.

Some bright spark decides to sue Bobsfarm Italy for poisonous Oranges. However Bobsfarm Italy claims it doesn't even sell Oranges, it only sells Apples. Case closed as Bobsfarm Italy is not responsible for its parent company in the USA.

true,haywire,eng-sussex,Brighton,"Ok so the way I see it, having helped organise protests in the past, it's all very well informing the police of a protest - it's is a good thing as it allows for safety and provisions. HOWEVER, and this is a big however, if the police just go ""nope"" when people say they're going to protest or basically castrate protests, the kind of obvious incentive is to do one ""illegally"". Informing the police should be seen more as a favour in the public's best interest, as opposed to going ""pretty please can we have the right to freedom of expression"". It's about balance. If they want to protest on campus grounds, about a campus issue, and the police go ""well the people that you are protesting about don't want you there"" then what the fuck do they think is going to happen?

So you either protest technically ""illegally"" (an utterly bizarre notion), and people go ""well they deserved the beatings they should have arranged beforehand silly students why can't they have a nice polite protest where nobody is bothered by them"", or you have the claws taken out of the protest and nobody notices anyway. Which is the logical choice?

The whole point of a protest is that there are certain people, usually the ones with power and connections, that are in opposition and don't want it to happen. If the police just exert the aforementioned peoples' whims, why would anyone bother to ""work with"" the police?

Basically if you have a nice protest about a nice issue with little opposition (such as Reclaim the Night), you talk to the police and they're all helpful and have a nice liason officer who helps you plan your route and you smile and shake hands and it all goes off well with the escort and the smiling waving coppers who you nod to and thank for helping you to execute everything safely. However, once you go out of the status quo and start protesting scumbag vice chancellors who are brought in purely to be sociopathic fucks who strip workers of their rights through privatisation, it is far less smiley, because the people you are protesting against don't want you to protest, and it is their property so they get the police involved to be the *biggest fucking cunts* in order to de-incentivise further action and resistance to their plans.",0,1386343333,null,0,1386343672,0,cdv227y,t3_1s8nzm,t1_cdv227y,t3_1s8nzm,null,1428368155,62,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,62

It's really a matter of effective communication. The Doctor is the Doctor. The numbering only matters in terms of fans being able to communicate to each other. From a pragmatic standpoint, everybody having to refer to 9, 10, and 11 as 10, 11, and 12 is a huge mess.

Immigration is not just a good thing, but necessary - **up to a certain point.**

The country is always going to need more doctors, nurses, seasonal workers and so forth than it produces. The issue comes when the influx is sudden and great - as happened with Poland and Lithuania in the last decade, and people fear may happen with Romania and Bulgaria next year.

There's a reason beyond racism to the fears of the working classes when somebody turns up, willing to work harder for less, and muscles them out of the labour market. It wouldn't be such an issue if the migrants spread themselves equally throughout the nation, but it often results in heavy influxes in certain areas and next to none in others. You ask a white, British plumber in Peterborough what he thinks of the Poles and you'll do well to escape without a black eye - ask a Scot on the other hand and he'll probably go off on one about the ""racist"" English and not having seen any threat to his trade.

In that sense, it makes me incredibly angry to hear people decrying those working class people who do express concerns as ""racist"" or ""xenophobic."" It won't help pacify any lingering social tensions, nor will it spread the migrant population and help them to integrate themselves into the wider society, instead of insulating themselves (and who can blame them?) from an indigenous people who they see as lazy, infighting morons too busy shouting at each other and pointing fingers to knuckle down and do some work.

My big gripe with economic migration is that it does more damage to the country the migrant leaves than the one they go to. There was a great BBC documentary called[ ""The Poles Are Coming""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVP0RRvl2WE&amp;list=PLD80EB68F4CF646AE) - which focussed on the strains it put on Poland as well as on the East of England - women taking up ""male"" roles (not a bad thing, but a sign of a stretched workforce), voluntary fire brigades, not a plumber in sight and so on.

My personal view towards EU migration is that it's deeply flawed and horrifically imbalanced, but that we spend so much time looking at the situation here that we miss the much greater problems it poses to the nations facing the emmigration. If more of the EU's budget went into funding infrastructure and industrial projects in the Polands and Romanias of this world (the former did, indeed, see a return influx for the projects associated with Euro 2012, for example), then it would be much less of an issue.

*And for gods sake, if more immigrants are going to arrive next year, encourage them to move across the country instead of consigning small parts of the country (Boston, Peterborough, Spalding, I'm looking at you) to social tension, strained public services and the essential scrapheaping of the incumbent working-class population.*",0,1386344956,null,0,1386345178,0,cdv2osy,t3_1s8h4m,t1_cdv2osy,t3_1s8h4m,null,1428367862,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

I don't know anything about you, or what you have experienced in the UK, but believe it or not not everyone and everything there is bad. As humans we are products of not only our environment, but also our mindset and attitudes to people, things, and places, so having a bad attitude and spreading it around like you are will only serve to make you feel worse. What's more, you are on the internet mate and pretty much everyone is going to just ignore you.

The fact that you are spending your time here at least proves that you have somewhere you can spend your time and access to the internet - and implies that because you have this you also have shelter, food, water, and maybe even a nice warm bed. Compared to hundreds of thousands of other people in this world, you have it pretty good.

It sounds like you also have a job (or at least access to some kind of income), and plans for the future. Compare to a lot of people *in this country*, you have it pretty good.

Stop shrouding yourself in hatred. Make the best of a bad situation. So maybe I'm just some random person on the internet, but I'm reaching out to you. You might be a troll account, I don't know, or you might be a real human being and have had some awful experiences and your attitude is a product of that. But no matter what has happened in the past, you can only make a permanent change (to yourself, your surroundings, or society) through positive attitudes and positive action. If I can, I want to help you.

I'll stop replying to your comments now unless I get a reply from you as really I've been exhibiting pretty dickish behavior. But, if you want to talk more just reply here or PM me.

If we never speak again, I genuinely wish you all the best with saving up to move away, and hope you have a happy and prosperous return to your homeland.

so i dont think there is an epidemic of childhood sexuality or sexuality in the media or the internet now as these things have always been in the internet and the media.

Sites like redtube where porn videos are easily accessable have been available since at least since around the time of youtube and image galleries and image boards since the early nineties. I don't see a generation of sex obsessed people running around. I just see feminists with a point of principle, cameron looking for more state control and a easy vote for the mary whitehouse conservative types.

true,JackXDark,null,null,"&gt;I think this lack of common law might come as a surprise to the courts, who have got quite used to applying the principles and developing it since the fifteenth century or so.

For clarity then, let's call it case precedent, which is different from the ideas about 'common law' which some people have, especially in areas like marriage, where different government departments treat things like cohabiting differently, or the 'Freeman' stuff, which claims some nonsense distinction between 'common law' and 'maritime law'.

&gt;the law provides that the individual may retaliate

I would still argue that retaliation is very different from self-defence and that the police are held to far higher standards than anyone else at all, and that in this case, the officer seemed to go beyond this.

If you think otherwise, then you would seem to be arguing that it is within the police's remit to deliver corporal punishment.

&gt; the officer still has the right in law to make a preemptive strike if has the honest held belief that he is about to come to harm.

Maybe, but the one he made here wasn't an especially effective one, which made it seem like it was made out of anger.

&gt;I wonder exactly how you would have expected the officer to restrain or control the assailant? A squirt of CS? A baton strike? Possibly even the discharge of a taser? All valid options.

By calling the other officer next to him, for a start. 

&gt;Unmitigated bollocks. You're going have to COGFO (Cite or GTFO)

Go and look at the testimony of the officer that shot the Lee Rigby's attackers. The words I quoted were almost exactly used. The phrase 'I was in fear for my life so I...' can be found countless times in court testimonies. You know full well where that comes from, I'm sure.

&gt;How do you know he was squaring up to him?

Interesting how you question that phrase and not the second bit, which is the more pertinent one.

&gt;Did you know that the moment you take your cuffs out, all people suddenly become compliant and offer you their wrists, often muttering something like ""it's a fair cop, I'll come quietly guv""?

Is this why you think it's okay for police to lash out? That there's an expectation of violence? From students?

Because yes, I would say that in 90% of occasions, if there is more than one police officer present, and it's a bloody **student** then yes, they would 'come quietly' or at least, not struggle or lash out to a dangerous level. And the remaining 10% that need more contact do not make it okay to punch or attack that 90%.

And yes, I've seen a few people arrested at protests that have done just this, after realising that they're not going to get any sense out of the copper in front of them, who isn't being reasonable, but might if they have a chance to talk to someone in a different environment.

Huge metaphor there I think. The doctor never checked because of the guilt he felt.

On top of that who besides the Daleks, which were seriously hurting after losing most of the troops, and the Timelords, which were all locked in a pocket dimension, would want to go back and relive those moments? It's also my belief that the doctor would be the only one capable of changing fixed points in time, even the other timelords fail at this, because he is the only one that has had any experience at it. 1200 years of practice, when it's against the Laws of time and no other timelord, besides the master maybe, would even dare to do it.

Since buying the club, we've reached promotion- probably the best things that could of happened to his newly purchased business asset.

False distinction. A terrorist is a non-state person or group who uses violence to achieve political ends. A freedom fighter struggles for freedom. Osama Bin Laden was a terrorist who fought to restore an Islamic caliphate which would impose Islam on its subjects. William Wilberforce was a freedom fighter who campaigned to end slavery. Spanish guerillas in the Peninsular war fought against Napoleon to regain their sovereignty, using violence. Terrorists and freedom fighters.

true,multijoy,eng-Surrey,Surrey,"&gt;For clarity then, let's call it case precedent

Lets call it common law, for that is the correct term. Ignore the FMOTL, and don't even think of letting their ideas corrupt the concept.

&gt;I would still argue that retaliation is very different from self-defence and that the police are held to far higher standards than anyone else at all, and that in this case, the officer seemed to go beyond this.
If you think otherwise, then you would seem to be arguing that it is within the police's remit to deliver corporal punishment

Not at all. I've never seen a fight where the intention was to deliver a single blow, and nothing more. If you are struck by someone in a public order situation like that, it is entirely reasonable to presume that another blow might be forthcoming unless you defend yourself. The case law is very clear - I'll refer you back to *Palmer* for the point about not weighing up the legal niceties.

&gt;Maybe, but the one he made here wasn't an especially effective one, which made it seem like it was made out of anger.

Were you there? Have you seen the context in which this took place? Would you be happier if he'd knocked the student out?

&gt;By calling the other officer next to him, for a start

Were you there? Did you hear if he did or not? Do you have access to a video the rest of us don't?

&gt;Go and look at the testimony of the officer that shot the Lee Rigby's attackers. The words I quoted were almost exactly used. The phrase 'I was in fear for my life so I...' can be found countless times in court testimonies. 

I put it to you that the use of lethal force requires a significantly higher level of justification than a smack round the chops. 

&gt;Interesting how you question that phrase and not the second bit, which is the more pertinent one.

Interesting that you don't answer the question. 

&gt;Is this why you think it's okay for police to lash out? That there's an expectation of violence? From students?

The fact that they're students is of no consequence. On the face of it, it appears that there are a number of angry young adults facing a smaller group of officers. I don't know the context of the incident, and neither do you. We don't know if he simply lashed out or whether he was responding to being struck himself or had an honest belief that he was about to be struck (That pesky common law again).

&gt;Because yes, I would say that in 90% of occasions, if there is more than one police officer present, and it's a bloody student then yes, they would 'come quietly' or at least, not struggle or lash out to a dangerous level. And the remaining 10% that need more contact do not make it okay to punch or attack that 90%.

What does their occupation have to do with anything? These days, with near universal access to higher education, a student is more-or-less representative of the population at large of the same age group. Your 'bloody student' is as capable as anyone else of punching someone, which is quite possibly what happened. Until the unedited video circulates (which it won't, because that won't suit the agenda of the filmmaker), we cannot say.

&gt;And yes, I've seen a few people arrested at protests that have done just this, after realising that they're not going to get any sense out of the copper in front of them, who isn't being reasonable, but might if they have a chance to talk to someone in a different environment.

They've been nicked and realised that they're not getting away, you mean? You don't choose to be arrested, you choose not to fight when you have been nicked. Coming quietly isn't that they've decided to consent to being arrested.

Secondly, there has been a lot more argument about the definition of terrorism than your conclusive and snappy definition would suggest.  As with all language, it has no concrete meaning aside from those we agree as communities to use.

Finally, what the cliché means - a point you appear to have intentionally missed - is that our views on actions, specifically those of terrorists, is inherently impacted by our proximity, the society we grew up in, the country we identify with, our political views, etc.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"Awwww yiss!  I wish we could have matches twice a week forever, but I think all the players would die.  Anyway, here's hoping we bring home 3 more points!  Since we love discussing potential lineups in threads like this, I'm hoping we get a look at Sakho tomorrow.  Something like this:

-------------------Mignolet--------------------


Johnson---Agger--Sakho---Flannagan

----------------Lucas----Allen-----------------

Aspas----------Alberto----------Coutinho

---------------------Suarez-------------------

Sakho and Agger at the back, Brendan pls!  I know they're both left footed but for me they're our best 2 CBs and I think they compliment each other rather well on their styles.  Sakho is basically made to defend against the kind of football West Ham likes to play, he's strong, fast, and a physical powerhouse who can play with the ball at his feet and Agger is a very intelligent defender with great technical ability.  Agger's form has been bad lately but if he gets a couple of games in a row he'll start to recover.  Skrtel has been really good lately but he's also played a long string of games in a row now and I think it's ok to give him a little rest.

I think it's a huge ask of young Flanno to play 3 matches in a week but we don't really have another option since for whatever reason Kelly still isn't quite fit enough for his return.  Cissokho hasn't done anything so far to warrant getting another chance (and I feel like Downing would wreck him... which says a lot really) in my eyes.  It's not all bad though since aside from the Hull match Flannagan has improved with each performance and his confidence is growing.  I'm pretty happy with how well he's done so far.

Lucas/Allen together sitting in there should be able to control the midfield reasonably well.  Allen is just a tidy player and he covers the space over Lucas's shoulder really well, which lets Lucas be the destroyer he's so good at being.  We saw against Everton how much more solid the midfield looked with these two next to each other (and in particular how much better Lucas played knowing he had a partner who would actually recover for once... I love you Stevie don't be mad).  We look stronger player for player throughout the pitch but we've been let down by our midfield a lot this season by teams we shouldn't have any problems against.  I think this is our most solid pairing for the 2 deeper midfielders right now.

I never thought I'd be calling for Alberto to be in the first 11 this season to be honest.  He's a promising young talent but I'm not sure if he's really ready for the first team quite yet.  That said, Henderson (I'm sorry Hendo, you're my boy but have a break lad, it's nothing personal and your hair is still as magnificent as ever you beautiful boy) hasn't been having much impact lately and maybe could do with a rest.  He's been running his heart out for us all season and put in a heck of a shift but with his downturn in form maybe he could use a break.  Gerrard too, I don't want him playing 3 matches in a week at his age and fitness, especially with the huge matches we have on the horizon.  Losing our captain going into a run of games against the top sides would be bad news bears.

Aspas gets a shout up front because Moses doesn't seem to give a shit about playing football for us and Sterling shouldn't be playing 270 minutes of football in 7 days.  Aspas is on his way back from injury and I'm sure he'll be really eager to prove himself considering he didn't get off the great start of the season I'm sure he was hoping for.  He'll be hungry and he's a very energetic player.  I'd imagine his style would let him link up very well with Coutinho and Suarez too, the amount of clever movement in our front line is just nuts.  Oh and Coutinho is our creative hub with Gerrard getting a rest so he needs to play a big part.  He got rested/used a a sub last weekend so I think he'll be ok for a starting role this time out. Gogo sexy Brazilian magician!

As for Suarez... I hope West Ham has plenty of lube ready because he won't be bringing any for them and he's just as happy to go in dry if they forget.  What a savage beast!",0,1386352209,null,0,false,0,cdv61jh,t3_1s8rta,t1_cdv61jh,t3_1s8rta,null,1428366215,22,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,22

We paired Carra with Skrtel plenty of times and didn't notice too much pain from it (with Carra usually as the left sided one IIRC).  And before that we had Hyypia/Carra and we did very well.  Skrtel is not very good in possession compared to our other CBs and the last defender in the squad I would have ever picked to play to his weaker side.  Just because he can't do it well enough when he's already a bit weak with the ball at his feet doesn't mean our more technically gifted CBs can't too.

The birthday problem, obviously, is where a room of 23 randomly chosen people will have at least 2 people sharing a birthday 50% of the time. The way you are calculating it, if there are 22 people in a room (all with different birthdays) and I enter the room, I have only a 22/365 chance of sharing a birthday with someone in that room, which is certainly true, but the answer to a different problem.

What you calculated is the probability that 1 particular shuffle will match any of the previous shuffles in history. However, what you want to calculate is that *any* shuffle will have matched *any other* shuffle in history, which has a much higher probability of happening. The reason is that rather than testing if shuffle ""n"" matches any of the previous 5 * 10^20 shuffles, we are testing if shuffle ""n"" matches any, and then if shuffle ""n - 1"" matches any, and then if shuffle ""n

In order to do so, we would calculate P(no shuffles ever matched) - call it p(n) - and then subtract that number from 1. Calculating this probability exactly is rather hard because you have to use numbers such as (52! choose 5 * 10^20) which are annoying to calculate, but we can approximate it:

 P(n) = e^(-(5 * 10^20)^2 / (2 * 52!))

If you take 1 - P(n) (I used wolfram alpha), you get that the odds are roughly 1 in 6.5 x 10^26, which is substantially lower in magnitude than your estimate.

true,JackXDark,null,null,"&gt;Lets call it common law, for that is the correct term. 

Except that it is not a set of 'laws' as case precedents can be changed by judges making new ones. Yes, if a court has made a decision in the past, it's useful to refer back to that and likely that similar cases will result in the same outcomes, but its not safe to assume that this will always be the case.

&gt;Were you there? Have you seen the context in which this took place? 

Of course not, but that doesn't mean I can't have an opinion about the police punching people.

&gt;Would you be happier if he'd knocked the student out?

If he'd had a dangerous weapon or been about to cause severe harm to someone, then yes, I would. In those cases I'd have been fine with an armed copper shooting him dead.

Your braying about 'you weren't there' notwithstanding, nothing here points to a punch in the face being a proportionate response.

&gt;They've been nicked and realised that they're not getting away, you mean? You don't choose to be arrested, you choose not to fight when you have been nicked. Coming quietly isn't that they've decided to consent to being arrested.

Not at all. Sometimes - and yes, I've been in situations like this - the police ask you to do something that you don't feel you should do, or the police have acted in a way that you don't like and you want the situation to change, and you don't say or do anything except to ask 'am I being detained?' If the answer is 'no' you keep doing whatever it was you wanted to be doing. If it's 'yes', and then you're being detained with the possibility of this escalating to an arrest, then what happens is that it should go on record and the police officer has certain obligations, which I'm sure I don't need to spell out. *Sometimes and frequently in protest situations this is not a bad idea.*

Just as another cool story for you, bro, I was with some protesters who had chained themselves to a building. A police officer had assessed the situation and decided that they hadn't broken any laws and they were only guilty of civil trespass, so didn't arrest them. They got bored and wanted to move things on, but didn't want to just undo themselves and walk away, so they took all their clothes off. In those circumstances, they definitely made a decision that they wanted to be arrested, as it made more of an impact. And they were exhibitionists, but anyway... You might well say 'they were stupid twats then', but as unfathomable as it may be to you, yes, there are reasons both good and bad to get arrested. 

Either way, you shouldn't expect that to come with unnecessary violence.

A few years ago, in a pub I got into this very discussion with a black guy who thought I should apologies for slavery (I'm a Brit) I replied that the Portugese started it, the main slavers were other Africans (both black africans and north africans, i.e. arabs) and that the British, as the main trading Empire certainly profited from transporting the cargo (as did other European nations) and that the death-knell to slavery as an international trade is acknowledged by most historians to be when the British Empire outlawed it.

**Stephen**: *""And now I have produced a pack of cards, and that pack of cards, ladies and gentlemen, believe it or not, has never before in the history of our planet been in that order.""*

Stated this way, it's not quite the birthday problem.  I'm solving for:

A) This particular pack of cards has never been produced by a random shuffle in the history of mankind.

vs your birthday problem:

B) There has never existed a pair of randomly shuffled *decks of* cards in the history of mankind which has matched order.

Problem A is more like ""If I add a new person to a room filled with people, what are the odds that the new person share a birthday with anyone already there?"".  Those odds are equal to or less than N in 365, where N is the number of people already in the room.

Stephen later goes on to talk about how many shuffles it would take to get a repeat, and that relates more to the birthday problem.

I'm making some logical deductions to simply the maths, that even if you ""stacked the deck"" and ensured that every shuffle that occurred in the history of mankind was unique (thereby making it easier to produce a duplicate), it's still statistically impossible to replicate a prior deck order.  It's a significantly more tricky problem if there has been a repeat in the past.

Your numbers are still enormous.  1 in 6.5 x 10^26 is [10 sigma](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=10+sigma). Scientists would *dream* of certainly like that.  I'd bet my life and my family's life on those odds in a heartbeat.

Yes, if a court has made a decision in the past, it's useful to refer back to that and likely that similar cases will result in the same outcomes, but its not safe to assume that this will always be the case.

Did you know that murder is still an offence at common law? On the basis of that fairly fundamental activity alone, I think we can safely say that the common law is *law*. 

I'm not going to get into the semantics of the common law because there are reams and reams of material discussing the principle; you might want to have a look at a first year Law reading list because you're missing some fundamental points.

&gt;Your braying about 'you weren't there' notwithstanding, nothing here points to a punch in the face being a proportionate response

There are plenty of circumstances where a punch to the face can be easily justified. A commenter elsewhere noted that it appeared the officer had his sleeve taken hold of - the fear of being dragged into a mob would be a sufficient to justify a comparatively high level of force. This is, of course, a hypothetical example. I can think of any number of reasons where the action was proportionate. I can also see when it might not be.

This is why my 'braying' about you not being there is not specious, it is entirely relevant - all we have seen is the tail end of *something* that resulted in a student getting a smack to the face by a police officer.

From what we have seen it is equally likely that the strike is justified as it is unjustified. It is as possible that the strike was the result of a comment about the officer's parentage as it was the result of an initial strike or other action for which it was a proportional response.

Not wanting to teach you to suck eggs, but there are always two sides to a story and it is entirely unfortunate that we're only getting one side, in a manner that is entirely geared to provoke a particular response.

I'm suspicious, by profession. I want to see the full video, I want to see the context surrounding it and I'm not content to condemn or praise the officer on the basis of blatant propaganda.
 
&gt; I was with some protesters who had chained themselves to a building. A police officer had assessed the situation and decided that they hadn't broken any laws and they were only guilty of civil trespass, so didn't arrest them. They got bored and wanted to move things on, but didn't want to just undo themselves and walk away, so they took all their clothes off. In those circumstances, they definitely made a decision that they wanted to be arrested, as it made more of an impact. 

That's entirely difference to the analogy you posited previously. In this anecdote, this group want to make an impact, so escalate to the point where they commit an offence and have to be arrested and thus detached from whatever it is they've chained themselves to.

You previously made the point that people would allow themselves to be arrested so that they could somehow talk sense to someone who isn't the copper in front of them (below).

&gt;And yes, I've seen a few people arrested at protests that have done just this, after realising that they're not going to get any sense out of the copper in front of them, who isn't being reasonable, but might if they have a chance to talk to someone in a different environment.

This is an entirely different set of circumstances which suggests that they've decided not to resist the arrest on the basis that they can't talk their way out of it.

------------------Mignolet-------------------

Johnson--Skrtel--Sakho--Flanagan

Aspas-------Coutinho-------Sterling

------------------Suarez--------------------

I think Sakho deserves a go and as much as a potential partnership between Sakho and Agger has been talked about (and as much as I would like to see it happen) I dont think that Skrtel deserves to lose his place in the defence and so I'd choose to have an SAS at the back in Skrtel and Sakho.

Flanagan keeps his place in the side but maybe take him off at some point for Cissokho to try and get him some confidence and into some decent form, and who knows maybe having that french connection at the back would pay dividends defensively in the  continued absence of Enrique.

Allen over Gerrard because I don't want Stevie to burn out before three big games we've got coming up in Man City, Chelsea and Spurs. He's one of those players who always turns up in those sorts of games so I think we can afford to rest him here, but I'd keep him on the bench just in case. Plus, Allen played fairly well against Norwich and this is one of those games where I can see him having more of an impact.

I want to see Aspas score a goal or two so it just makes sense to me to have him switching between playing off of Suarez and cutting inside from the wing because with Suarez in such good form there's definitely going to be chances to score.

Sterling was one of the players who didn't play well against Hull but did okay against Norwich and managed to get a goal, for me it was between him and Luis Alberto (I still haven't forgiven Moses for his part in the Hull defeat) who hasn't done much but also hasn't done much wrong, I just don't think he warrants a start as of yet but I'd like to see him come on as a sub for 20-25 minutes.",0,1386357880,null,0,false,0,cdv8pjr,t3_1s8rta,t1_cdv8pjr,t3_1s8rta,null,1428364899,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8

true,maybelying,null,null,"The time lock occurred because the Timelords and Daleks were abusing time travel and temporal weapons in the early days of the war.  It wasn't instituted by either side, they wouldn't choose to handicap themselves that way.  

This issue will probably never be settled, but I'm of the opinion that the Moment was used initially, and the Doctor rewrote history.

First, the moment told 8.5 that 10 and 11 were from a future where the moment had been used.

Second, the reason that 8.5 and 10 lose their memory of the events of DotD is because their time lines are out of synch, as mentioned in the episode, and only 11 would remember because he was the current incarnation and represented the ""real time"" position in 11's timeline.  This is in line with previous episodes where Doctors have crossed timelines, the earlier Doctors never remember.  It would be paradoxical for a timelord to remember an event that hasn't yet occurred from their perspective on their timeline.

Based on that, the events of DotD couldn't have changed the individual timelines for 8.5 and 10.  Timelords are not able to alter their past.  The Blinovitch Limitation Effect has been referenced several times in the past as preventing time travelers, even Timelords, from going into their past and re-doing or changing their past actions.  On a side note, this principle is probably the very reason that the area of the time war became time locked as a consequence of temporal abuse.

11 can't go back and change history for his previous incarnations, but he can change his future.  This was also stated by the moment, that the future can be re-written.  However, it can only be changed from 11's position in the timeline because at that point his future hasn't been set (same reason Clara didn't see any future incarnations of the Doctor in his time scar, despite the fact that we know there will be)

So I'm convinced that 11 went back and re-wrote history for the universe, but not for himself.  In other words, Gallifrey was destroyed by the Doctor right up until the point where he travelled back in time and altered history.  Viewing the episode from that perspective respects series canon, as well as the story arcs that had been building with regards to the Doctor learning that history could be re-written, and that you can alter a fixed point in time as long as that point can be observed to have happened the same way.

I just can't buy the ""he just forgot he didn't use it because"" solution.  To me that undermines the entire tone of the rebooted series.  He did kill the timelords and he has been searching for redemption - now he has found it, so the next quest is to help Gallifrey find redemption as well.

Anyways, that's my story and I'm sticking to it.",0,1386358136,null,0,false,0,cdv8twc,t3_1s8pe9,t1_cdv8twc,t3_1s8pe9,null,1428364843,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

You can't buy whole Doctor or season bassets of the Classic Series, because they'd be far too huge and incredibly expensive.

If everyone was shuffling decks according to some [Fischer-Yates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle)-type shuffle then your numbers would be sound, but we generally don't shuffle that way (casino dealers try).

The TARDIS now accepts the command from her; it's accepted from the Doctor so a companion of the Doctor is easy. Maybe saving him made the TARDIS a bit more sympathetic.

Not explicitly, but she said it's not impossible for him.

I completely disagree here. He has good pace for a center back, good jumping and strength, and his ability to throw himself in front of a shot is almost unparalleled.

I miss the neighbourly spirit that used to exist, people looked out for each other more or at least it seemed that was the case, not looking for how to rip each other off.

I miss the local pub ambience as well, ever since the smoking ban something seems to have changed, that and people sit looking at phones / ipads rather than chatting.

When i was a younger man i went all over the country and could soon make friends in a pub, that seems harder now, either somehow because i am older, or simply that people seem entirely concerned with the phone that they are in their own little world.

true,JackXDark,null,null,"&gt;Did you know that murder is still an offence at common law? On the basis of that fairly fundamental activity alone, I think we can safely say that the common law is law.

Then I think that *you* should have a look at a few first year law texts, and may I refer you to the Homicide Act 1957. 

Case precedent regarding various circumstances may affect murder, but each and all of these may be  interpreted in different ways. 

To apply that in turn to the actual OP here and the pertinent point, case precedent is what you *might expect* an outcome to be in a future court case, but *it is not permission or entitlement*.

&gt;all we have seen is the tail end of something that resulted in a student getting a smack to the face by a police officer.

Granted, but my interpretation of it is anger and not an appropriate response to a threat. Of course, my interpretation and opinion means little and I'd revise it with further information, but it does not *seem* justified at all.

&gt;You previously made the point that people would allow themselves to be arrested so that they could somehow talk sense to someone who isn't the copper in front of them (below)...  ...This is an entirely different set of circumstances which suggests that they've decided not to resist the arrest on the basis that they can't talk their way out of it.

Yes, and I don't know whether you've experience of this or not, but people do 'come quietly' when faced with a reasonable police officer, or use it as a way to reach a different one and go on record. Not that they 'can't talk their way out of it' but so that the circumstances may be investigated in a different place.

The point though, is that in many cases - particularly at protests and I've **seen** the police escalate and antagonise and badly handle situations, you'd probably even get other protesters wanting someone acting dangerously to be arrested and removed. Again, an anecdote, but at one event someone ostensibly on the 'protesters side' displayed Nazi symbols and acted up, and the other protesters wanted nothing to do with her and pointed her out to police and said she had nothing to do with the 'official' protest or organisers (and yes, it was a her, oddly enough). If they'd thought she'd get beaten up by the police, they would have acted differently. In recent years, the way the police have acted at protests has seemed highly antagonistic and unnecessarily violent and it's really not doing any good whatsoever in terms of giving the copper in the OP's video any benefit of the doubt.

I disagree.

Demonstrators in London are afforded every opportunity to protest lawfully and the tactics used are repeatedly upheld in the courts, and the cases are brought by some of the finest barristers in the country.

The most noticeable is the chief economist of HSBC, give [this article a read](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2013/jul/19/economy-end-growth-resource-scarcity-costs). It's a bit US-centric but I think it applies to all western economies, we will all face similar problems going forward.

I agree the real median wage is a good way to determine how well off ordinary people are, but it is limited as inflation doesn't take into all costs, most notably housing costs, and is not a perfect measure for the costs it does take into account (for example, the falling costs of gadgets causes inflation to be lower, however that is much less of a concern to most people than the costs of food and electricity). It also doesn't take into account things that the state provide, such as free higher education (gone) and free healthcare (going soon). Also median wages [have been falling since 2009](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171766_299377.pdf) and are predicted to fall in the near future too. The problem is that if growth isn't going to return*, then it means median wages aren't going to increase either and this recent trend is not a blip but will continue.

&gt;A taxi driver, unless required by the hirer to drive more than 12 miles, or more than 20 miles in respect of a journey which begins at Heathrow Airport, London, or for a 
longer time than one hour, is under a duty to accept a fare.

It is deemed to be in motion for these purposes even when actually stationary, providing it becomes stationary due to prevailing traffic conditions or, for example, to comply with traffic signs or signals, or the directions of a traffic warden or constable. If a taxi driver stops his vehicle in response to a signal from an intending hirer and speaks with him he is then technically ‘found standing in the street’ and must accept a lawful hiring or he commits the above offence.

Who + whatever ending is for the nominative case (the subject of the phrase)

Farmer = nominative

Girl = accusative

Accusatives are the objects of verbs and prepositions. In the example I gave, the girl was the object of the verb 'sees'

In the title of this post, the user had the idea partially formed. It would be 'whomever' if it were in a phrase like ""to whomever it may concern"" because the pronoun (whom (+ever)) is the object of the preposition 'to'.

However, in the title the continuation includes a verb whose subject is the pronoun. Let's replace the whomever with Jim. This post is directed at Jim, who saw the dalek. 

Since relative clauses always modify the noun (or pronoun in this case), and it is Jim who saw the dalek, he is the subject, and therefore it ought to be whoever.

They sent me a letter telling me I needed to repay a £600 bursary. I called them up and told them I was reapplying to university, I had unconditional offers, and I was eligible to receive the same bursary, and it would make more sense for them to take it out of that. They told me they couldn't do that, I had to pay it back. Seemed silly, but I gave them my bank details and we set up a direct debit.

Then, 6 weeks later, they sent me another letter. This time, they were telling me that I need to repay them £600 upfront, AND they were charging me £30 for the privilege of them sending me a letter. Apparently, this was because I didn't pay them on time. This was confusing - they set up the direct debit. They took money out of my account. I know I had enough money in there because of my overdraft. So I checked with my bank, because I wanted to know wtf happened.

It turns out THEY cancelled my direct debit. They set up a direct debit with me, cancelled it, then sent me a shitty letter demanding I pay them up front, and threatening legal action if I didn't.

But turns out you're way wrong.  I'm wondering what gave you this impression? Rafa always complained about not having money to spend, but he did spend a decent amount, totaling £135.7 million net in his 6 years. But that amount is cancelled out with the around £30 - £40 million in CL revenue each year.  Since Rafa, we have spent £107.5 million in 3.5 seasons, but we've also increased our revenues quite a bit to cover that CL money we are missing.

Of course, transfer fees aren't the only expenditures, as you have salaries, operating costs, agents fees, etc. But, FFP, as I understand it, is only concerned with making sure you don't spend beyond your revenues.

I think it comes down to 'face' as the UK government and it's war tribunal system has to be seen by the public and the rest of the world to be abiding by the rules that have been set out and agreed upon during the conduct of war. 
Alexander Blackman did break the Geneva convention as he rightly states him self in the video footage, he acted un humanly in the theatre of war and killed in cold blood; a combatant who was entitled to dignity, respect and humanity. Neither him nor his squad were in any immediate threat at the time, especially not from the wounded insurgent. 
When he pulled the trigger he committed a war crime, and now he faces the consequences of that crime in the same contempt that any murderer would face in the UK. 

But it's just another 'rag head' right? What difference does it make? Many people with take this view in anger and in support of a long standing loyal Royal British Marine. An elite highly trained soldier, engineered to kill. Just doing his job. Fighting for his country.

Of course like many crimes these days, it's not the act it's self that warrants the punishment when given the circumstances. It's the principles. The laws. I wonder how many people actually, truly care deep down that a Taliban insurgent was put out his misery in the middle of Helmand province minutes after being unzipped by an apache helicopter?

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"Yes, you missed that because that wasn't what I was implying at all.

I didn't say anything eugenics or that I think it should be illegal for stupid people to have children. And I've never seen it seriously and/or popularly suggested anywhere in /r/unitedkingdom or mainstream Reddit that people shouldn't have the ""right"" to have children.

I was merely saying that people having children at the age of 15 when there is no plausible way that they could have the emotional maturity or financial resources or life stability to support a child without outside intervention and help is really, really stupid.

Especially given the fact that we are in a country where condoms and pre and post coitus contraception are freely, widely and anonymously available to all. There's very little chance of accidental pregnancies happening any more unless the people involved actually want it.

So yes, I think it is highly inadvisable for a person like the one in the article to have a child at the age of 15. It's likely to cause significant extra pressure and stress on the parents and their families at a time of already high stress of trying to deal with life and hormones as a teenager. Frequently, this results in broken households, single parents and kids who grow up without the full loving support of two parents that every child deserves. I won't even talk about the burden this puts on their families and the state to support these kids. It is a significant problem in our society (and many other societies) today.

But do I think it should be illegal? No, I don't see how that could be feasible or moral. It would be too much of a violation of human rights.

The only thing I could think to do would be to take sex education further and perhaps at an earlier age, stop demonising teenagers for wanting to act on their hormones, and keep making contraception easily available as it is now. Education is the only way teenagers will learn about the true responsibilities that come with having a child.

Regarding /u/throwaway_time's comment, well, some people like to feel morally superior over others even if based on totally false assumptions. He made brash assumptions of my views based on his own misunderstanding of the comment and then made a childish attempt to insult me personally.

Uh...needs a little work. Your Os are too big; they're becoming Js. You can't have a dotted letter intercepting a line; they conflict and create a character that won't translate (hence the question marks). You've got a T in ""are"" because you've forgotten to put the dots. ""Stars"" has letter lines hitting other letters, which changes them; if the lines go all the way through them it doesn't matter, but when intercepting, they apply to both characters.

I put your attempt at ""made"" at the end of the sentence because usually words are written concentrically around the outside before working inwards; you can put words closer to the centre but I felt that ""of"" was too close to ""are"" and ""made"" to far too the centre relative to it to put ""made"" in front of it on this occasion.

I do like the design though; with a few corrections it could look really good.

Now, I'm going to launch into a long discourse about how to serve the tea properly. Americans, feel free to stop reading.

Its important to remember the words of Douglas Adams, who famously stated: There is a very simple principle to the making of tea and it's this - to get the proper flavour of tea, the water has to be boiling (not boiled) when it hits the tea leaves. That's why we English have these odd rituals, such as warming the teapot first (so as not to cause the boiling water to cool down too fast as it hits the pot). And that's why the American habit of bringing a teacup, a tea bag and a pot of hot water to the table is merely the perfect way of making a thin, pale, watery cup of tea that nobody in their right mind would want to drink. The Americans are all mystified about why the English make such a big thing out of tea because most Americans have never had a good cup of tea. That's why they don't understand. In fact the truth of the matter is that most English people don't know how to make tea any more either, and most people drink cheap instant coffee instead, which is a pity, and gives Americans the impression that the English are just generally clueless about... I think now the Americans will have stopped reading. The party is a trap. We invite them in under the guise of friendship, then lock the doors and murder them all, Red Wedding Style. The Song which will be played highlighting the start of hostilities will be World in Motion, when John Barnes starts singing. Remember to prepare yourselves. So the best advice I can give to an American arriving in England is this. Go to Marks and Spencer and buy a packet of Earl Grey tea. Go back to where you're staying and boil a kettle of water. While it is coming to the boil, open the sealed packet and sniff. Careful - you may feel a bit dizzy, but this is in fact perfectly legal. When the kettle has boiled, pour a little of it into a tea pot, swirl it around and tip it out again. Put a couple (or three, depending on the size of the pot) of tea bags into the pot (If I was really trying to lead you into the paths of righteousness I would tell you to use free leaves rather than bags, but let's just take this in easy stages). Bring the kettle back up to the boil, and then pour the boiling water as quickly as you can into the pot. Let it stand for two or three minutes, and then pour it into a cup. Some people will tell you that you shouldn't have milk with Earl Grey, just a slice of lemon. Screw them. I like it with milk. If you think you will like it with milk then it's probably best to put some milk into the bottom of the cup before you pour in the tea.1 If you pour milk into a cup of hot tea you will scald the milk. If you think you will prefer it with a slice of lemon then, well, add a slice of lemon.

The little i have seen of him he looks like a quality player, but one that doesn't really bring anything new to our current group of midfielders.  We already have Demble/Small Paul filling the B2B role, Sandro/Capoue as the deep lying ball winner. Eriksen to fit the playmaking #10 role and i would guess that Banega is established enough by now that he may not want to be second fiddle to anyone. He isn't a true deep lying playmaking midfielder (though probably could do it from what i have seen just not where he has been playing when i watched him) that we have been lacking since Modders left, but the guy has a really good eye for the pass so who knows.

A government monopoly is less motivated to innovate because it's risky and the rewards don't match the risks.

I **adore** Donna's grandfather - Wilfred Mott - and I'd give damn near anything to see him back time and again.  Love Micky/Ricky and Capt. Jack of course.  I also love Rory, big time... he's a close second behind Wilfred and tied neck &amp; neck with Capt. Jack.  

I don't like Amy, or Rose.  I like Martha better than I like either of them.  

I grew up watching Classic Who, started watching as a little kid in the Tom Baker era.  He's ""my"" Doctor... and Sarah Jane is, and always will be, first in my heart among all the companions - Classic or New.  I bawled like a baby when Lis died.  I still have a hard time seeing her on screen without tearing up.  She was incredible.

Amy &amp; Rose rank last on my list among all of the companions - and for the same basic reason:  the utter disrespect they showed to the men who loved them (Micky &amp; Rory).  Seeing Rose rolling her eyes behind Micky's back utterly disgusted me - I was done with her from that moment on.  Amy at least redeemed herself in her treatment of Rory over time, but after experiencing the Rose/Micky thing, and then seeing Amy treat Rory with similar indifference/condescension early on, it turned me off from her.  But as I said, her later treatment of Rory was somewhat redemptive, so she gets to sit a notch above Rose.

I will say I'm not really surprised that Reddit is being the way it is over this. Usually the people in the position of not being able to negotiate working terms are the poor or those in lower paying labour like retail. People who often find themselves with slave driver bosses. The types that Reddit usually runs to with slacktivistic zeal and upvotes. But not this time because it's religion. We could live in a tolerant and open society were cultures are respected. In the building where I work there are communal spiritual facilities on one of the floors. My colleague Wasif goes to prayer during the day three times. No one bats an eyelid. We could get pissed off about him being paid to pray and come up with some bullshit about Pastafarians needing colanders on hand at all times in case the noodly one calls on them to meat the balls or something, but instead we choose to be adults. In another job I had a Jewish colleague got to clock off on Fridays early so he could get to Temple. He made up for it by staying later on Thursdays. It would be nice if we all - employers and otherwise - could accept that people have spiritual needs to help them feel happy and fulfilled in life and that should be kept in mind when considering labour laws.

Agreed! That is where players that are loyal stand firmly by the anthem that Liverpool has come to be known for. While Torres is a bad example and Suarez might become onea in the future, players like Gerrard, Carragher and Agger show us what YNWA is.

Ask Borussia Dortmund fans what YNWA means for them during their big european nights or Ian Holloway on his recent trip to Anfield where he literally cried singing along his oppositions anthem. They both know how strong the feeling is while singing it.

 That is the drive that we as humans yearn for, something that pushes us beyond the 100%.. whether it is real or not in a materialistic world is unimportant when such an experience gives you goosebumps. Football or Soccer as it is called across the pond where I live, is just a means of entertainment for us humans when viewed objectively, but then again a world viewed like that isn't much fun to live now, is it?.. what makes it beyond just a game is our undying human emotion to support and feel belonged. And for that reason YNWA will forever remain in the hearts of those that have experienced it atleast once.

true,NotFaux,,Coleraine,"I work in the main H&amp;W docks semi-regularly and they have been incredibly busy recently. It's really beautiful to see the place alive again. I remember being there 2 or maybe 3 years ago, talking to a couple of the crane operators (indoor cranes, operated remotely from the ground, although we were on top of them) and they were really saddened by how much of a lull they were in. They seemed pretty mad at the current owner of H&amp;W who apparently wanted to develop the whole area and build apartments or something, but was shut-down due to Samson and Goliath becoming protected, so he was forced to try and make H&amp;W a successful business again.

Anyway, got sidetracked there; the place was empty. I'm talking about one of the huge warehouses (the largest warehouse as you enter through the main gates, directly in front of you, that one,) the place must be at least 100 meters long, and is split inside into two buildings. It was just empty space, nothing occupying any of the space at all.

Recently though when we've been the place has been an absolute hive of activity now that they're building wind turbines, it's really great to see. Although if the graffiti in their toilets and hearsay is to be believed most of the workforce are unfortunately not from Northern Ireland (which to me is sad because N.I is so iconically Northern Irish, to me it should be full of people from this country.)

Also: Those wind turbines (or whatever they're building, looking back on it they may have been building something for the oil rig the last time I was there) are huge.

Sorry for this being so incredibly long, it's almost like a rant.. Have a [picture I took](http://puu.sh/5Er9k.jpg) from the H&amp;W yard. Nothing amazing but I'm proud of it.

true,JimmyNic,null,null,"&gt; I'm sorry, but this has always been a pet peeve. 'Nasty whiff' of moral relativism? Moral relativism is a cogent philosophical position. You can't assume it's wrong because you find it distasteful.

If good and bad are entirely subjective, than a philosophically cogent position would never have any moral objection to anything anybody does, on the grounds it might be ""good"" in someone's view. If good and bad are tied to an objective measurement, then they are not relative. 

&gt; Secondly, there has been a lot more argument about the definition of terrorism than your conclusive and snappy definition would suggest. As with all language, it has no concrete meaning aside from those we agree as communities to use.

There are sound reasons for drawing a line between state and non-state actions when defining the meaning of the word terrorist. Chief among them is that states by definition are violent, indeed they demand a monopoly on violence in many contexts. This means that saying a state is a terrorist organisation is to say the state pursues its political aims through violence, which is to say that a state is a state. Delineating between non-state violence for political ends and state violence for political ends thus gives the term ""terrorism"" currency.

&gt; Finally, what the cliché means - a point you appear to have intentionally missed - is that our views on actions, specifically those of terrorists, is inherently impacted by our proximity, the society we grew up in, the country we identify with, our political views, etc.

One's beliefs on the theory of natural selection are inherently tied to the society, era and culture that we grew up in. Yet evolution by natural selection is a fact, regardless of whether you believe it to be. If morals are to any extent objective then this is a universal. If morals are not at all objective, then they are meaningless, or at best no more than expressions of various group interests.

&gt; What the admittedly clichéd phrase does is ask you to have a little empathy for a moment, and empathy is never a bad thing.

The cliché is deployed, like most clichés, to stymie debate. There may always be too sides to an argument, but nobody should ever assume that both sides have valid points to make.",0,1386382520,null,0,false,0,cdvjbgg,t3_1s8ono,t1_cdvjbgg,t1_cdv5okt,null,1428359826,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Pricing (after marketing/recruitment) is the largest challenge of any small business owner.

At any rate though, I don't know who you're printing them with, but they probably offer significant discounts for volume orders. That might make it affordable enough to sell at a $34.99 price point or $30 price point. And you'd be surprised how much of a difference even that $5 might make - $40 (or $39.99) is one of many ""magic numbers"" in consumer goods, like $59.99, or $129.99, that people tend to look at as ""thresholds"" that take a product from ""eh, I can afford that"" to ""wayyyy too expensive"". And the difference is dramatic.

My (unsolicited, I'm a total asshole) take on this would be to place an order for 100 (Vistaprint prices this at $700; I'm sure you'd sell right through them given the interest from the community) and move the price down to $34.99.

That said, given the current state of the economy I can't see why I would take the chance on voting for independence. It's obviously anecdotal but several friends and family members are pretty well entrenched in the finance industry, and none of them can see how we'll be able to realistically afford to break away from rUK and then compete with it.

true,bobisterbezreal,uk,London,"Powell was a complex man, so simply painting him as a racist may be overly reductive- not least because when he said racist things, his motives were likely more complex than at first visible- but simply declaring him immune from that accusation is no less simplistic. There's no doubt that the [rivers of blood speech](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/3643823/Enoch-Powells-Rivers-of-Blood-speech.html), which would define his political career and was the most significant element of his legacy, was not just ""anti-immigration"". 

Anti-immigration it certainly was, but that was not all it was. He spoke of, and sought to validate, the opinion that he characterised as ""ordinary"", that demographic change would give ""the black man will have the whip hand over the white man"". He speaks at length in the speech of a story of a woman who was accused of racism (how dare they!) simply refusing to let rooms in her boarding house to people who happened to be black. She is tormented, in Powell's terms, by abusive ""Negroes"" and smiling ""piccaninnies"". The question worth asking of Powell, then, is why was a man who was not racist so happy to use the inflammatory language of racial hatred? Even where ambiguities exist in his language, he makes no effort to clear them up one way or another; if a man with racial prejudices and racist opinions were to hear that speech, he may very reasonably assume that Powell was on his side, and so they did in their droves. Or, as [Mike Philips put it](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/0098/feb/09/obituaries.mikephillips), ""Powell had become a rallying point for most of the hostility and rage we encountered, a shorthand for hatred and contempt. ""I'm with Enoch,"" they said, or ""they should let Enoch sort you lot out,"" and that was enough.""

The language which Powell used is, for me, an interesting middle stage. We see much in that speech that is, to all intents and purposes, racism outright. The imagery he uses may seem now to be a bygone phenomenon, a distant and monochromatic memory. But there is also there the green shoots of the language that would develop from there, the clumsy but nevertheless more creative language in which the remnants of Powell-esque racism is couched. The lessons of demographic fear, the insistence that those of other belief who seek religious freedom are demanding ""special rights"", the concern not for those who face racial discrimination, but rather for those who are accused of being a racist. Or, going to Philips again, ""He offered British politicians a model for racialist rhetoric which was to last for a long time - when, a decade later, Mrs Thatcher spoke of British civilisation being ""swamped"" the Powellite echoes were unmistakable, and successful."" Nowadays, we can see that language in more or less adulterated forms- comparatively copy-pasted into the narratives of the BNP, and flirted with by UKIP and the Conservatives.

As far as I can tell this is the model in Singapore where they seem to generate a lot of their government revenue simply from companies that the state the provide services but that also make a profit.  That is the way I would prefer that things were done here.  

It does require a massive mindset change in the public though.  For example, now that the Post Office has been privatised people will stop trying to save their local post office with petitions and other nonsense.  It would have been pretty difficult to stop them doing that before hand.  Also a government may come in and try and run something like the Post Office efficiently but before they've finished turning it around a new government could come in and try to 'save' everyones jobs.  You can see why they might just say 'Screw it, lets sell it.'  Because at least that way it's not costing them money anymore and they make a decent short term profit.  (Which when you're in a load of debt like we are right now, can be quite a good thing.)
