I'd suffered from periodic bouts of intense stomach pains since I was a child. Same story each time - sharp pains on my left side, then either it would fade and disappear or the pain would spread across my abdomen, intensify further, I'd be sick until I was so exhausted I'd just fall asleep.

I'd spoken to doctors about it years ago who diagnosed 'abdominal migraine' which sucked cos it was just like 'deal with it'. I also had a full ultrasound scan and a barium x-ray, both of which turned up nothing.

I occasionally got attacks from this thing as an adult but much less often, and only lasting around 24hrs as opposed to a few days. This summer I had an attack that lasted three days. My dad took me up to hospital, at which point I'd developed an infection, my hands and face were all pins-and-needles, I could barely stand, and I hadn't slept, eaten or drunk anything for 72hrs.

The doctors put me on fluids and paracetamol straightaway. A little while later they come around with an ultrasound machine and assess the situation. A difference in my kidneys led them to call for a full CT scan, which unearthed a grand total of three kidney stones, two on the left about 1cm in diameter each, and a tiny one on the right.

I stayed in overnight and underwent surgery the next day, and then had another procedure a few weeks later. I am going in again on the 17th, at which point it will hopefully all be sorted.

All the while, the doctors and nurses I've dealt with have been amazing - I even felt compelled to write to the trust to comment on the conduct of two nurses who were just fantastic. To think that they're doing this day in, day out, while people endlessly criticise the institution they work for is nothing short of heroic.

In Islington alone hundreds of young girls are being married off (http://www.islingtontribune.com/news/2012/jan/islington-girls-forced-marriage-age-nine). There is a huge cover up around this issue. But the fact is there is an entire branch of the foreign office that works 24 hours a day to try and stop this community condemning their daughters to a life of marriage to someone they don't want to be married to. Then of course we have the thousands of honor based violent attacks on those girls brave enough to say no. Finally we have the fact that the inbreeding in the Muslim community is out of control, so we have a situation where 3-5% of the country account for over 1/3 of genetic defects. 

Let's recap:

-Teen marriage

-Forced marriage

-Pre-teen marriage

-Female Genital mutilation

-Inbreeding, leading to defects

-Honour based violent attacks/murders

-Asian sex gangs preying on young girls all over the country

-Sex selective abortions

-Polygamy 

-Women rarely work

-Very high birth rates

-Males allowed to marry outside of faith, females not

Whoever is going to win the league this year is standing at 16 points right now, at the very most.

That's a difference of a single win or less, so it's not exactly crazy talk that a team with 13 points 7 games in *could* in fact win.

1st: we are an attractive team to someone like pirlo. We have a relatively young manager who won't undermine pirlos influence and team presence. We are located in a great european city, far better than playing in Manchester or Dortmund. We have a young team of hard working players who would love his mentoring. We may very well be playing champions league football to boot. Pirlo doesn't want a Michael ballack situation and just sit on his ass while his team wins without him in the twilight of his career. He's the kind of player who would consider this an end of career project: to help this skilled but inexperienced group of dudes into champions league victors. 

Some say we don't need him in the midfield. I disagree. If we hope to go deep in CL next year,  We can't have guys like paulinho playing 4 matches in 2 weeks. Center mid is probably the most physically taxing position on the pitch. Our current formula is as follows (once sandro and capoue get to form): pick 1 holding mf (sandro/capoue), pick 1 box to box mf (dembele/paulinho), and pick 1 attacking mf (eriksen/holtby). I know we've been playing a dual box to box pivot thing, but I don't think it's the way to go forwArd, personally. So anyways, when someone gets injured, that gives us to either change the formation,  would leads to probably a weaker team, or play a midfielder more than once a week, which can and will lead to injuries and poor play in the long haul. The strength of pirlo in our squad is that he can play either of those mf told effectively. He's a good get.

It's difficult to say. I (selfishly) can't wait for the market to crash and reset house prices to a manageable multiplier of the average salary; however this will leave a lot of ordinary people in negative equity.

The Bank of England should increase the base rate sharply - back up to around 5% or so - but this would lead to a lot of short-term pain as many people find themselves unable to pay their mortgages. There would be defaults right left and centre, house prices would plummet because no one would be able to afford these ridiculous prices, home owners, banks and investors would swallow big losses, but by the end of it you'd have a real housing market.

But they won't do this; instead they're suppressing the base rate to an historical low [(see this graph for how unprecedented this is)](http://i.imgur.com/DBKmGAs.png) which is yet another kick in the balls for savers trying to get on the property ladder. It's purely for the protection of those who are already on it.

Basically someone's got to write down all this fake money as actual losses but no one wants it to be them.

&gt;Also, how does this make me guilty of trying to get one over on everyone else?

Didn't mean you personally. But those who have managed to save enough to pay for a deposit (even at 5%, that's a fair whack of money these days) are complicit in maintaining the status-quo, which forces far too many people into lining the pockets of private landlords when they should be able to afford a reasonably-priced home of their own.

&gt;And if the real risk is a crash, wouldn't it be better for part of the risk to be shared, as opposed to me risking the whole deposit?

I don't quite get what you're asking? If you're saying ""isn't it better for the government to be paying part of my deposit?"", then not really because ultimately you're still liable for the money. So you'll feel like you've lost less upfront but you'll be saddled with a crippling debt.

&gt;What would you recommend a person in my position should do? I just want a home to make my own, to start a family in. Renting doesn't give you that.

It's easy to recommend renting, but rent prices are sky high right now, and the chances are that your monthly outgoings will be cheaper with a mortgage...it's a very difficult choice I'm afraid.

I forget when wanting proof of something, especially when that is being used to discredit an entire religion, is 'hiding behind the facts'.

From reading your proof that '3-5% of the country (Muslims) account for over 1/3 of genetic defects' (which non of it does, and many parts of the articles actually dispute your points, but it does prove that inbreeding and birth defects are higher in those groups), they all seem to point towards the fact that people aren't told of the dangers of this. This isn't an argument against multiculturalism, it's an argument that we should give larger amounts of information to these groups.

&gt; My alternative is not to force everyone to be the same culture. It's to openly recognise the cultural inferiority of the Islamic community. To say that they are wrong, and we are right.

true,_workaccount,null,null,"Much like that /u/hayha said, but a bit more context -

The Security Services (MI5) works with intelligence for internal UK matters; this is, terror threats from 'homegrown' cells, trafficking, etc. SIS (MI6) work with foreign intelligence - so spies that keep tabs on political intelligence. They have a ""sister"" relationship as a terror group or smuggling ring abroad may likely affect internal security also, which falls under TSS's remit.

However, TSS and SIS have no powers of arrest. A *spook* cannot arrest you; they generally maintain a network of informants (HUMINT) and should they have enough of a 'case' for a criminal act then they will provide the details to SOCA (now NCA) who do have powers of arrest and thus begins the justice process. TSS then return back into the shadows. 

Bearing in mind, a lot of intelligence work is treated as collecting and analysing information from sources that may be of use at a later date - more of an 'FYI' to the Government to be kept for later use politically or for the purposes of security rather than intentionally tracking criminals for arrest, which is the police's job. There is a close relationship between all of the agencies, but they do all have fairly well defined roles. 

&gt;For example; are TSS going to chase down the bloke who nicked your bike? No. However, it's a hypothetical that the SIS (MI6 - International Intelligence) are following a Middle Eastern Drug Baron who is influencing the national elections of a foreign country. They happen to discover this drug baron has links and contacts in the UK, and has been importing heroin. 

&gt;The money made in the UK from drugs sales is being used to buy votes for political candidates that do not align the the UK's foreign interests. This information is passed to TSS (MI5 - Internal Intelligence) who investigate further (The SIS will not do this because it is on UK soil) and once there is reasonable evidence an certainty of *who is doing what*, TSS will call up the NCA - previously SOCA - and say ""Hey, we know this, you should probably arrest these guys right here"". 

&gt;It becomes a win-win-win; the police get an arrest and prosecution, TSS uses its intel from the SIS and other sources to save the UK from tonnes of heroin importation and the SIS have cut off the money supply to the drug baron, preventing somebody the UK Government dislikes from getting into political power. Thus completes the hypothetical cycle of modern day intelligence work.

&gt;Marriage to a blood relative accounted for nearly a third (31%) of all birth defects in babies of Pakistani origin.

It does not point toward there being no information for these communities. They don't listen to the information. It's well known, it's just not accepted. You only have to see how much they kick off when presented with this information. They don't want to hear that their marriage, or their parents etc. marriage is going to cause problems. I have worked in hospitals where we have told people if you have another child it will almost certainly be born disabled, and they say that's ""Allah's will"". Mohammed himself was OK with cousin marriages, and the Quran condones it, so they won't say it is wrong. They won't accept it, end of.

In Brendan's optimal formation we need a backup DM.

If you're looking at at our squad solely in terms of holes and soft points in the short term next 12 months: 

Backup (or starting depending on your take on Lucas) DM

LB (I've generally defended Enrique but if you're looking at our first 11 he's certainly the one position we would upgrade first)

Striker (this is solely for if and when Suarez goes)



You say a winger but right now we've got too many players to fill our attacking slots. The only way a winger would be worth it would be if he would score and create enough goals to negate the impact of taking of Henderson. Konoplyanka in no way represents that possibility. The guy is a tricky wide midfielder with no real goal threat and whose generally too far from play to make a lot of assists.

Pastore? To go where? Replace Coutinho? I'll take a pass. And there's no way he'd be available at any price low enough to justify him starting on the bench.

So that prices go down on imports and that we can buy more things with the money we have, so the pound becomes stronger. 

This happens via cuts, simply as that really. Personally I believe harsher cuts should be implemented until we are paying off our debts not increasing them.

Now, some would call it eavesdropping but when one is insistent on shouting in a crowded area it's difficult not to drop eaves on such a conversation.

""No."" replies the wife rather curtly as she scans the offers for the second cheapest bottle of white wine. She doesn't want the basics range table wine but £12.50 for a bottle of Chateauneuf du Pape is too expensive for her purposes.

""Well, the back of this bottle it says to serve it over ice in a Jeremiah Weed jam jar"" the man at this point is becoming notably agitated at the bottles seemingly baffling instructions.

""I don't know"" she retorts in a tone that conveys the message of 'Don't get pissy with me'

Our protagonist places the bottle back on the shelf in disgust and mumbles to himself ""How the fuck are you supposed to drink this""

Don't get me wrong - you are defiantly correct, but you're also wrong.

The current rate for cycling is around a 2% share (thats where you are right). But the government wants it to be higher. And the only way that will happen is if it impacts on car travel

Now on the face of it im sure to many that seems unfair. But we cannot really continue as we are. Cars are too big, too heavy, to polluting and to dangerous to continue as they have been. There is no reason other than willing not to increase cycle use and lower car use. The benefits to overall society is for the better.

So its not really about compromise - its about maintaining a safe environment.

Now regardless of that - London rush hour has a 25% cycle share, and I don't know how much Cambridge has, but given its the most popular cycling city in the UK I would guess its between 15-30%.


&gt;A one lane only system like this effectively halves the rate at which vehicle traffic moves

this is the problem - if I was to go by my own estimates Id say 80% of morning traffic is single occupancy cars/4x4s (round my way). Why don't people car share, why not use the bus? Congestion is not just as a result of small roads, its a result of people not willing or not being able to travel effectively.

Interestingly, adding cycle lanes encourages the most effective mode of transport we have.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I interpreted these figures in a different way. It's very important to have a consistent definition of mental illness in drawing any conclusions.

1. From your quote, the incidence of mental admission in the general population of Wales was 11,101/3.064 million = 0.36% of the population. The incidence of homicide among people admitted to mental institutions is 10% [1]. Therefore if Wales is representative (not something I'd bet on), people admitted to mental institutions appear to be over 27 times more likely to commit homicide than the general population. 

2. In particular with schizophrenia, from [1] ""There were 357 homicides by people with 
schizophrenia (based on lifetime history) over 
2001-2011, 6% of the total sample"". Comparing this with 0.72% of the general population having schizophrenia [2] shows schizophrenics are 8.5 times more likely to murder than the average.

It's true that reporting particular segments of the population are more likely to commit violent crime can be seen as stigmatizing. Nonetheless, it may still be true. The fact mentally ill people are far more dangerous to themselves is irrelevant: the numbers point to the conclusion that if you want to minimize your (very small) risk of being murdered, you should avoid the mentally ill.

&gt; All of RTD's companions are much different from when they first set foot into the TARDIS. 

Marginally. I didn't see any evidence that Donna's relationship with her mother had changed, we just saw a wedding, what does that tell us? Actually, Donna is the worst example you could think of, she was building towards a great arc and then she was set back to zero, undermining everything she went through. 

Rose has some good development in series 1, in series 2 she becomes more and more irresponsible. In total, her arc consists out the following: She starts of as being head over heels falling for the Doctor and ends as somebody that is so head over heels falling for the Doctor that she needs her own private Doctor to be happy. 

&gt; I personally can't see much arching in Amy's or Rory's characters other than the things we're told they happened

No. No no no no. If you are honestly thinking that then you haven't seen the show and I mean that whole-heartedly. Watch The Eleventh Hour and then watch the Rory in series 6, taking on Cybermen and punching Hitler in the face. Watch Amy in The God Complex, The Wedding of River Song and The Power of Three, she has become completely grown-up, sorted out what is important to her and finally knows which direction her life should be going, which she didn't know at all at the start of series 5. 

Her character arc is probably the biggest in all of New Who. It's quite similar to Martha's who had the best arc of the RTD companions. 

It's no problem if you like different companions then me. But don't start on character arcs and shit.

Likewise, when Redmond came on he was absolutely explosive, and, in my mind, his tenacity warrants a starting spot over Snods. 

Also, even though this is hard to implement, I'd like to see Hooper getting a bit more game time. Obviously our formation limits this to a large extent, but Van Wolfswinkel hasn't exactly been firing.

QF: Manchester United - 6-0 thrashing. Hat trick from John Obi Mikel and John Terry with all 3 John Terry goals coming from penalties. At FT, Jose Mourinho points the finger at Wayne Rooney while shushing the United fans. David Moyes breaks down in tears in the post match interview while claiming that Fergie had a bad first season at United as well

SF: Liverpool - 0-0 on aggregate in the second leg at the bridge. 89 minutes played and Luis Suarez is through on goal, when out of nowhere, Branislav Ivanovic puts in a sliding challenge, breaking both of Suarez's legs. Ref waves play on. Frank Lampard picks up the ball and dribbles to 40 yards and blasts one. It hits the bar and rebounds onto Daniel Sturridge's face and fires into the goal. Frank Lampard celebrates by taunting Steven Gerrard saying he's ""the real number 8"" meanwhile, Jose Mourinho runs onto the pitch and does Daniel Sturridge's shitty dance celebration over Sturridge who is clutching his face. Chelsea advance

Final: Spurs - Pre game, AVB claims that he is the real 'Special One' and also claims that Lamela is better than Willian. The game begins. Willian scores 9 goals. The game ends. Chelsea fans erupt with the Willian chant causing Villas Boas to cry. After being asked why he was crying by the media, he says ""I just miss Gareth so much""

Champions League

Last 16: Arsenal - 0-0 at the Bridge in the first leg. We go to the Emirates and Ashley Cole scores a hat trick revealing an undershirt which says ""#9 years"" and a picture of him kissing the Champions League trophy. Chelsea win 3-0

QF: Galatasary - Didier Drogba back at the Bridge. A respectable 3-2 aggregate win for Chelsea. Both Galatasaray goals coming from Drogba who also refused to celebrate. The Chelsea fans chant his name for 90 minutes straight and give him a standing ovation at the end of the game.

SF: Barcelona - Typical Barcelona bullshit at Stamford Bridge being awarded 9 penalties throughout the game. All from dives. Messi takes all 9 penalties and misses each and every single one. Chelsea win 1-0. At the Camp Nou, Barcelona have 75% possession and play some beautiful football creating very good chances. All of which fall to Messi, and he misses. The game ends 0-0. Cristiano Ronaldo jumps out of the crowd at FT and begins rubbing his new Balon D'or award in Messi's face as he sits next to the goal crying.

Final: Bayern Munich - Back and forth game. 3-3 at FT with goals from Ribery, Robben and Mandzubitch for Munich, and goals for Hazard, Torres and Lampard for Chelsea. No goals are scored in extra time, and it goes to penalties again. It's 3-2 to Chelsea when Schweinsteger steps up for the fifth kick. He runs up, does a stutter, Cech stands still, then Schweinsteger blasts it, sending the ball into row Z. Chelsea celebrate, Jose Mourinho tea bags Pep Guardiola while whispering ""I am ze special one"" and the fans savour more Schweinsteger tears.

In the off season, Jose Mourinho gets knighted and is now referred to as 'Sir José' ",0,1381179406,null,0,1381179734,0,ccmzxtt,t3_1nwuan,t1_ccmzxtt,t3_1nwuan,null,1429211748,16,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,16

true,organisation,null,null,"About Dr Kelly? It goes back to the claim made prior to the Iraq war when the gov claimed Saddam's weapons could reach the UK within 45mins if launched. Later Andrew Gilligan challenged the document which had this information, famously calling it sexed up. He refused to say who had told him this info, but eventually it came out in the press as Dr Kelly after the MOD confirmed it after journos named him. He (Kelly) then went before a select committee where he was pretty humiliated by the questioning (one of the reasons why I absolutely hate what Margaret Hodge does now, it's only a matter of time before someone else gets pushed over the edge) and Kelly later apparently committed suicide.

There was a report into his death by Lord Hutton, and I would say it was this report that more than anything made people think there was something wrong because it was embarrassingly, painfully complimentary to the gov. If you can find some news reports from youtube from that day then you'll see what I mean. 

I'm skipping quite a bit but that's the background. Hutton sealed all files to do with the death for 70 years, and no decent explanation has been given for that. Also there is doubt over how Kelly died. It was reminiscent of the Marconi scientists' deaths of the 80s. Plus the then gov, and Alistair Campbell in particular, have always denied overdoing the claim of 45mins. There's another enquiry at the moment called Chilcott, but there's a lot of doubt over whether he'll be able to release certain information which means it'll be another failure again.

Hospital admissions would relate to serious cases, and an even smaller segment of those would be forced admissions (i.e. ""Sectioning""). 

What you've missed is that I referred to the 10% figure as people showing symptoms of mental illness, not just those who were patients. Hospital admissions are for those who are actual patients. Hospital admissions are a tiny percentage of those who suffer from mental illness, and are usually only serious cases. Most mental illness is dealt with on an out-patient basis or simply via your GP. If 1 in 6 people currently suffer from mental health issues, then 500,000 people in Wales would currently be your figure. The difference this makes to the figure would be 16.6% of the population with a mental health problem of one sort or another. This means they are LESS likely to commit homicide according to the statistics alone. Also, you've used current census data for population, not compared to my 2008 figure. The difference is slight, but important if you want to compare figures. Must admit, I shouldn't use Wales as I was using English data for my other figures.

Point 2: I've said nothing about particular mental illnesses. I'm only talking about mental illness as a whole. The shame is, a lot of mental illness is hidden or unseen, as, obviously, it isn't a physical condition. So you can't really react to random attacks in the same way as, say, staying away from certain high-incident areas, or even use ethnic prejudice (both are better to avoid being murdered if we are going by logic here).",0,1381179928,null,0,false,0,ccn05f7,t3_1nx1lx,t1_ccn05f7,t1_ccmxc1j,null,1429211650,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

You need to compare the proportion of homicide suspects who'd come into contact with mental health services over the year, with the proportion of general population who have done the same. This is going to be much less than 1 in 6 people. The Wales figure does look at the correct figure (0.36%), but not for the whole country. However it does give some idea that people who come into contact with the mental health system are unsurprisingly rather more likely to commit homicide.

I was a huge critic of Hughton last season for persevering with Howson when he was dreadful for several games, but he's been one of our best players recently. I feel a bench role will get the best out of Redmond, as it keeps pressure on him low, and he'll come on when he can make the most of his pace. 

At the back, Turner is probably better at the last-ditch stuff than Bennett, but Bennett is undoubtedly more assured on the ball, and reads the game very well, so he has to do less last-ditch defending. Coupled with the fact he's got a lot of potential, I'd much rather Bassong-Bennett was our first choice partnership.

Elsewhere, I thought RvW had his best game yet yesterday, so would like to see us continue with him. Playing two strikers is going to be very difficult, particularly when Tettey, Fer and Howson are starting to play really well together.

You'd run into issues like costs of running a studio, post production and the tech costs of broadcasting content. In digital Tv age you'd also be stuck with creating enough content to last 24/7, it'll likely lead to repeating a lot of content or buying a lot of new shows to keep it fresh or broadcast in limited air time. Then there's the issue of competing with all the other digital channels who buy bigger shows and can afford better marketing spots, in the past there was less competition for viewers. You'd have to be very low cost to be sustainable on small ratings and only local content. For people making homegrown productions they tend to use youtube, since it's cheaper and they control their content to earn back money.

[Winterbourne house](http://www.winterbourne.org.uk/) in Edgbaston, I think it's around £5.50 each and you can spend an hour or so walking around the gardens.

[Botannical gardens](http://www.birminghambotanicalgardens.org.uk/) in Edgbaston is quite nice. £12 for 2 adults. Personally I didn't find it great value for money but I'm not particularly botanical. It was nice as a place though.

I realise you said no canals but if you haven't done the canal walk from Five Ways (well.. city centre) to University train station then you've missed a really nice walk.

The more famous parks are Cannon Hill (bus: 45) and Sutton (train to Sutton Coldfield then small walk), however don't miss Highbury park (bus: 50 I *think*) which is in Moseley. Mostly it's just fields and quite a few trees dotted around, but it has a really nice ""fish pond"" which is quite large, has ducks and the like. Unlike the more popular parks, it was almost deserted when I visited. Also, if you do go to Cannon Hill take your own food because the cafe there isn't good value.

Next to Cannon Hill is the [Stirchley Nature Centre](http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/naturecentre) which is a damn steal at £5 entry. Bus: 45.

Sticking in that area you can walk along the River Rea, also known as [national cycle route 5](http://www.sustrans.org.uk/ncn/map/route/route-5) (the yellow line). It does lean onto part of the canal for about half a mile but the route as a whole goes through a variety of urban and park-like areas. Start at Cannon Hill and it ends up in Longbridge train station a few miles later. Goes via Kings Norton Park, Popes Lane, Northfield train station.

Bournville park is an interesting one. The park itself is very small though it has a nice river flowing through it, but the highlight is the nearby church which plays actual songs on the bells. Unfortunately I don't know the timetable for this but I'm guessing every hour.

Near Bournville Park is Valley Parkway which is a large pond and a lot of grass, and a **lot** of geese and ducks. Not much else around there.

Much further out there's the Lickey Hills in Rednal (go to Northfield, keep going) for, well, hills. Get to the top of either the ""main"" hill (the one with the large open area) or the other hill which is covered in trees, and you can see right to the city centre. It's quite something. There's also Pinfields Wood just to the south which is a mile long wood with multiple paths.

Bartley Reservoir looks amazing and it's really damn big. I haven't yet had chance to walk around it but just the sight from one side is something quite special. Near that is Woodgate Valley Park. Personally I didn't find this too interesting. There is a stream but it's covered on both sides by overgrowth and it goes on for quite a while, however if that's your thing it's not a bad place at all. Also has some horses (in their own field). Busses: 61 or 63 to Northfield then swap to 18 to the reservoir.

That's all I can think of off the top of my head. Don't think this city is just buildings, there are so so SO many green areas and parks it's baffling. Pull up google maps and just awe at all the green. Some of it is a bit dull, like Selly Oak Park which is just fields with some paths, but some of it like Highbury Park is so nice that I would take my laptop there and work by the pond if it didn't weigh so much.

The video was about emphasising steps an individual can and should take to minimise risks to their personal safety, how anti-rape education won't impact those who rape for power rather than sexual reasons and that those behind the education campaign didn't seem to get this.

The response dismissed the first point, suggesting that individuals already know how to minimise their risk, focused on how education may help those who rape for sexual rather than power reasons whilst failing to address the point made about power and that those opposing the education campaign don't seem to get this.

In fact the Doctor was doing all of this in attempt to not have to fight the family. He was trying to avoid killing.

The only thing he was cruel to Jack about was leaving him behind in season 1. Jack is a fixed point which made the Doctor uncomfortable.

It's also cheaper to make a reality show (which is often as scripted as a sitcom) than it is an in depth science show or scifi (especially scifi) which makes the whole thing a win:win for the production companies and the channels commissioning the shows. 

Sadly even the BBC is not immune to this, it has to keep an eye on how marketable the programs are overseas as well. 

I'd also not be surprised if a similar situation to DAB played out with DVB-T, there was much talk about DAB having so many available carriers due to multiplexing that we'd see an upsurge in community radio, licenses would be available and affordable and it was all going to be sweet.  Then entities like Clear Channel brought up great gobs of it cheap and stuck a price tag that was nigh on impossible for an indie to afford on it and you have multiple channels all totally indistinguishable from each other.

The crime here is not one of mistaken identity, it is an unprovoked and vicious assault on a defenseless man. Even if he were a paedophile, attacking a man in his home is not how justice works. It is the responsibility of the courts, operating on the authority of the Crown, to determine suitable punishment for those found guilty of a crime.

&gt; She boasted on Facebook that she had 'defo found the right one,' that his face would be a mess, she had enjoyed the violence and ""I even jumped on his head myself."" 

I would argue that someone who takes that level of pleasure in engaging in violent crime is more of a danger to society than the average paedophile. She needs locking away until such a time as she can be deemed rehabilitated and safe to release. ~~16 weeks is an insult to victims of violent crime everywhere.~~ *Article has since been corrected to read 16 months which is closer to a reasonable sentence.*

Are there no offenses she can be charged with for refusing to name her accomplices? I don't feel safe knowing that that these violent thugs are still out there.

10 did see it has his duty he was just upset about doing it. I think it's understandable that a person who has lived for 900 years feels resentful sometimes at always having to sacrifice himself for the greater good. I think that's what we are seeing, a moment of frustration for the Doctor.

true,selorn,tennant,Tennant,"I'm not familiar with this topic, but I can't say I'm entirely surprised to hear this.

The Doctor fits a LOT of archetypal and mythological tropes, mainly in terms of a benevolent trickster figure.   Look at any mythological or folkloric trickster figure and I'd bet you'll see similarities between them and the Doctor.

One figure I've always enjoyed to connect him with is Manannan Mac Lir, the Irish god of the sea and Otherworld(well...in some accounts, Celtic mythology is a touch smokey in certain parts).    Manannan is a god who is associated with wisdom(in some myths, it is in his kingdom that the Well of Wisdom resides), and who the other gods themselves often look towards for help when the need is dire(in some accounts, it is he who supplies the gods a feast which makes them immortal; and also, there are myths where he is the foster-father of Lugh).   In connection with this, he is often the source of magical items, which he never seems to run out of(his magic cloak, his sword Fragarach, his horse Enbarr of the Flowing Mane, his goblet of truth, etc.  Most relevant is the Crane-bag of Aoife, which is bigger on the inside and can hold entire cities or ships).

Similarities to the Doctor become clearer once you read more of his myths, and realize that most often, despite being a god connected with such lofty things as the sea, the Otherworld, and wisdom, he is very often portrayed as a benevolent trickster.   He is almost always tricking one person or another, one way or another; but it is always for the better and he doesn't really harm anyone(one myth even outright says that he undoes any harm that his pranks cause).   However, the way he is presented changes from myth to myth.   In one myth, he is a king and teaching someone a pointed lesson.   In another, he might be a clown who simply wanders Ireland and enters and exits events as he pleases using his intellect and abilities to escape and trick others.   In the next, he is disguised as a fool and turns the tide of an event through his deceptive abilities in one area or another(e.g. he's an oafish, slow giant entering a footrace against a group of invaders; but he outraces even their best racer with ease).

To counter-argue your points though:

- one: it may not be the same landmass, but neither is the Falklands, yet, just two decades ago you lost something like 250 soldiers in that war.  Neither are the numerous other island territories a part of Great Britain, yet, because they are relatively peaceful, they seem to get a pass from that general argument you put forth.

- two: well, yes, it is *very* backwards, but if you think Britain had no part in that, you're being very close-minded.  Belfast was one of the first industrialised cities in the U.K. -- sewage pipes, electricity, gas, the whole sha-bang! -- at the turn of last century, so what happened?       
The first half of the century saw **Irishmen/Northern-Irishmen fight for Britain in both World Wars** (200,000 in WWI of which there were 30,000 deaths; I can't find accurate figures for WWII, sorry, but the country was split by then).  In-between was the Easter Rising and the Irish War for Independence, both quelled by the British, with the latter resulting in a some Irish independence.      
The problem was now that it was too late: those who had fathers/grand-fathers die in WWI/II felt that their ethnicity was tied to being British, not Irish, and thus, until the Northern Irish have a majority vote for independence, it's simply not going to happen, there's too much of an advantage remaining a part of the U.K. than there is to separate, and the politicians realise this -- politicians are slimey cunts worldwide, remember.

Hmm... that was just a little overview, but don't forget The Troubles in the latter half of the century, either.

Personally, it's the least that Britain deserves for its colonialist past, in my opinion.  Even when they pay for primary eduication in Kenya (I think), that's the very least they can do.  *They* are partly responsible for these countries being so under-developed (renaming Ghana: ""The Gold Coast"", for example) and so this is the consequences of those actions.

true,QuiescentAdolescent,dalek,Dalek,"I disagree. Of course, she wasn't perfect, and she had her damsel in distress moments, but I think Rose had quite a lot of nerve from episode 1. At the end of the episode Rose is the one who rescues the Doctor and the rest of London. She's thrown headfirst into a terrifying situation but she manages to keep her cool and find out a way to get herself out of the situation. 

There's also the episode where we're introduced to the Daleks for the first time. Rose is trapped with this thing for most of the episode. She sees the way the Doctor reacts to this thing, how it terrifies even him, but you don't see her in hysterics or sitting around waiting for the Doctor to rescue her. There's a point where she faces what everyone believes to be certain death, and the most important thing to her is that the Doctor doesn't blame himself for her death. 

As for the ""pining for the doctor"" part, I think that she can be a little jealous at times, but it's important to remember that this is a 19 year-old girl who has been swept away from her old life into a magical adventure(cheesy, I know) with this guy. She obviously adores him; I mean, damn, I do too, but I really don't see how she ""pines"" for him. Adores him? Yes. Flirts with him? Yes. Wants his hot Time Lord body? Hell yes. But the idea of her devoting all of her time to making eyes at the Doctor is just silly to me. Isn't it possible to be in love with someone and not dote on them all the time? Sure, she gets jealous, but you gotta remember that this is a teenager and the most mysterious, magical, brilliant, fantastic man in the universe. He's one of the most important people in Rose's life, if not the most important, and I can understand her getting jealous, even if that is annoying. I think it's important to realize that Rose is not in any way perfect, and I like that. I think Doctor Who, at its core, is about being human, and how wonderful that can be. 

I've kind of lost my train of thought here, but my point is this: Rose isn't perfect. Rose gets jealous, and she strung Mickey along, and she treated him like shit at times. But to take all the times Rose was a shitty person and then pass judgment upon her based on that is to ignore all of the times Rose was amazing and helped the Doctor save the world a thousand times, or to ignore her cleverness and her strength and her kindness and that's just damn unfair. 

I didn't mean for this to be so long, but I didn't realize how much I cared about this subject. Sorry for the wall of text!

It doesn't make sense to me, but are a handful of quotes from him saying he'd like to play abroad from Italy and accept new challenges. Nothing points toward Spurs, nothing suggests that there is no chance he leaves Italy, as you suggest.

When asked about playing in England, he said: 

‘Maybe, who knows?’ There’s that smile again. ‘I don’t know what might happen. You never know. I still have two years left with Juventus, this season and next.
‘I like English football a lot. There are plenty of very good teams. They are very aggressive so it’s always entertaining to watch.
‘It wouldn’t be a problem for me fitting into that particular style because I’ve played with different players with different characteristics throughout my career.’

You teach to the test in the UK; all you do is encourage rote learning and how to pass exams.   You will have pre-determined grading systems based on the national curriculum, and lo and behold if your students don't meet the levels.  You will encounter teachers faking grades to meet those standards, teachers arriving at school at 7am and not leaving until 6 (which I have never encountered in Canada; that's not to say they don't do the work, but they don't do it at school here).

true,pandanomic,num23,,"I mean, in a nutshell:

West Ham congested the shit out of the midfield. This in turn didn't allow us to dominate the midfield. This, coupled with Walker being clearly not 100% and Naughton being played out of position again, puts a lot of pressure on our high line defense.

At halftime, AVB should have taken Walker and Dembele off. Put Naughton on the right, move Vert to LB and put in Chiriches/Kaboul in for Walker. Put in Sandro for Dembele (who was hardly having an impact). When we can't control the game, and Paulinho's playing that far up, we need Sandro/Capoue in there. Sandro in particular protects the back 4 so well, and takes a huge amount of the pressure off.

Those changes I think would have allowed us to retake control of the game (I mean real control, not just the frantic bat-out-of-hell approach for the first 15min of the second half). Getting control back would have allowed Eriksen to find more space and come back into the game. At 60 bring on Lamela or Soldado (let's face it, Defoe's either rusty or not cutting it for the PL anymore). Should've ended in a tie, but instead AVB waited and then tried to solve the problem with more attacking players. To his credit, that worked great against Man City in the spring. To his discredit, City was all offense that game, and West Ham was all defense this game.

AVB was caught flat footed in his tactics, and Allardyce made him look static and like an amateur. AVB will learn, and bad days happen.

I can't wait to see Townsend bang those crosses to Soldado now that he's being more proactive. Rose, Capoue, and Lennon are all coming back too. We're 3 points off the top spot.

By the by road, I really love Amy and Rory's romance. It feels amazing to watch them champion through obstacles after struggling with said obstacles, including the bumps in their relationship. I'm the type that really appreciates the writers, (and everyone else responsible) for showing a serious, but fun, adult relationship without forcing sexuality into it... That is, we know that they had sex, but that was respectfully left for the characters to do in private.

While Joss Whedon does add an occasional, tasteful, kinda non-hollywood sex scene, I don't remember ever feeling like the characters were written or adapted for the sex scenes, but rather, the sex scenes seemed to be carefully written to be, not only acceptable for the characters, but right for the characters.

I was thinking how he could best be utilized, and I'm imagining a 4-3-3 as an attacking formation for home or whenever greater firepower is needed. Standard back four with three center mids, a defensive minded one deepest, (Lucas or upgrade, either) a general cm tempo setting mid in the middle (gerrard for now, Allen or Henderson rotated in / in the future if they perform well enough) and coutinho at the peak of the 3, closest to the forward three where he would either mark the opposition DM if there was one when we're without the ball, or else press an immediately close opposition player when they're on the ball, and if not pressing, drop in-between the lines looking for space to receive a pass once we've recovered the ball if there is no dm in the other teams formation. 

In the front three Dzagoev would play as a sort of complete wide player, roaming the right side (I think that's his preferred side) of the pitch in attack while Sturridge and Suarez would set up with Sturridge as CF and Suarez just off him to the left and slightly behind Sturridge in their original positioning, but would effectively operate as the type of 2 striker partnership they are so successful at now, constantly rotating and moving about in the area. 

What say you? That's the best I could think of to get Suarez, Coutinho, Sturridge, and Dzagoev (or any wide player, could be Moses right now) all in the same lineup together, so it's obviously going to be fairly attack oriented so probably wouldn't be the thing to play at bayern or anything but sounds like it could be pretty good when we would want to play it.

Ideally we'd have a player who is willing to stick to the touchline as well as willing to work the channels can work in that system. I feel like that is what Rodgers wanted Moses for, and hopefully in a few weeks when everyone is back we'll see both our formations produce some devastating results. If Moses finds success in that role then we might look for a more permanent option there come January (only if the right player is available obviously), if he does perform as well as expected I have a feeling Chelsea might not want to allow a move or really screw is in the pricing.

As far as Dzagoev goes if he ticks those boxes I would definitely expect him to thrive in this system but i'm not the best judge for him: a few international games is all i've seen of him and those were no doubt highly motivated, and finely tuned performances.",0,1381218247,null,0,false,0,ccncnul,t3_1nwh9v,t1_ccncnul,t1_ccnc7jc,null,1429205799,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Social care is managed locally, not nationally, so you'll need to look into the social care department for the local council. For example, here's a site for the [City of London](http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/services/families-children-and-young-people/childrens-social-care/Pages/default.aspx). 

Be aware that you may need to provide more evidence than the anecdotal. Ultimately this should come from the child, not a friend in another country. As the person in question is not legally an adult yet, I believe this becomes quite tricky: without taking her into care, the council will put her on a list and (in theory) check on her welfare regularly, but there's a long history of abusive people managing to fool / fob off social workers in this regard (as I'm sure there is in the US as well). 

You're doing the right thing... good for you. Evidence is probably going to be the key thing here: for the authorities to act, they need proof that this is happening.

BPR stands for British Public Radio, and is attempting to become a rival to radio 4, which is exciting enough as we already have far far too many radio 1 + 2 clones out there, so a new talk radio station should be good. Furthermore, the programs I have listened to seem to all be pretty legit documentary, discussion type programs, similar to what we find on radio 4.

Some fans will also point out some of his substitutions were mind boggling. We lost out on 3rd place to Arsenal by 1 point. Yet when we were drawing against Villa (from memory) he subbed on Scott Parker instead of an attacking player. That ruffled a lot of feathers and there are rumours that Levy was furious.

He also had a terrible rotation policy (run the best 11 into the ground) and had favourites within the squad. On top of that a severe lack of ambition in anything that wasn't the league meant that spurs weren't even in the running for trophies. 

He had good points, for example I think he would have beaten West Ham on the weekend and AVB certainly did not. 

EDIT: I will also note he had a far better squad then AVB did last season. A firing Adebayor in front of VDV and Modric with King at the back is a phenomenal spine.

true,DevilishRogue,cnty-england,England,"&gt; I recall Murkett pointing out that women do minimise their risks already? All day, everyday etc. Part 10 spoke of this.

Again, crossed-purposes. The video guy wasn't saying that women don't do risk reduction already, he was arguing that putting resources into educating on risk reduction is more effective than teaching men not to rape. The responder isn't acknowledging or addressing this.

The responder doesn't even seem to be disagreeing with the video poster about risk management being a good thing. There seems to be a quite acceptable middle ground that the responder ignores because of bias against the video guy. In other words the responder is more interested in making the video guy look wrong (apparently for ideological reasons) than in actually reducing rape. This undermines the respondent's whole argument and makes it look like a partisan criticism (which it is). 

&gt; I don't suppose you've come across any women, blogging or otherwise, who agree with Tf00t's position? I'd be interested to read/hear them.

I only saw this yesterday but will keep my eyes open if you like. I lean more towards the idea of education being more effective when geared towards potential victims than potential attackers (although the info the responder posted about misunderstandings of consent were quite interesting reading) simply because everyone in Western society is taught that harming others is wrong and this is reinforced from childhood onwards and this is reinforced throughout our whole value system. On the other hand specific safety tips are not taught or reinforced as widely in society and are useful in preventing not just rape but assaults, muggings and other violent crimes for both sexes.

That would require I spend far more on sensors and actuators, to the point where the additional cost of a purpose built controller would be trivial.

It has no sata connection, so it would need to be connected to a crappy external usb drive. I'd prefer to spend £20 extra and build a computer that's fully capable of the job.

I honestly can't think of a use for a robot. And the cost of one makes the cost of a pedant fairly trivial again.

Getting to know people is always difficult when moving to a new country especially if you don't have any friends/family there already. You will meet people through work, a quick internet search will direct you to various clubs and meet ups. There are clubs for hiking and mountain biking, and I'm sure you can find social groups specific to an area of interest local to your area. Most big cities have a number of free running/jogging clubs if that interests you.

The curriculum is so strict that there's not much extra effort to bring people up to speed unless they have special needs.

If you're shit at English or maths when you leave primary school then you're going to have to work harder at home because the schools will put you in a class of around 30 people and expect you to keep up. The problem is that kids won't want to work hard at something they're bad at because in general it's off-putting when you know how bad you are at something.

Personally I'd make sure that at high school you did at least one hour of maths and English per day, like you're supposed to in primary school, compared to the three hours a week (IIRC) they have now.

The maths syllabus needs to be scrapped entirely and redeveloped by people who know how to teach maths, with totally different syllabi for different levels. i.e. more practical (e.g. money handling etc.) for the slow learners and one that requires more problem solving and logic for the ""smarter"" kids.",0,1381228662,null,0,false,0,ccndux9,t3_1nz1xc,t1_ccndux9,t3_1nz1xc,null,1429205241,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

No. Buying a house isn't the same as dental treatment. There's nothing wrong with renting.

The government are building new houses, just at a sensible level and the private sector still have to sell at market rate. They also have to build a certain percentage of affordable homes.

&gt; BTLers and people buying property as an investment vehicle I'm not so concerned about (they knew the risks, investment can go down as well as up, etc.).

There's so much hate for landlords on here. They're providing a service, there's nothing wrong with letting property to those who can't afford / don't want to buy and using the money as a retirement plan.

Building too many houses is a problem and would lead to another crash. I don't even think that they're too expensive now. As a single man fresh out of university I will be able to buy a house in the south within 2/3 years. That's not unreasonable at all.

true,CrashingAnalyst,eng-gloucestershire,Cheltenham,"&gt;No. Buying a house isn't the same as dental treatment. There's nothing wrong with renting.

A house is something I'd class as an essential good - something you need to live. Same as water, same as energy, same as food, same as medicine. It's something that if the free market fails to provide optimally, it's no surprise that the government will intervene. That's why governments around the world have various social policies towards building, renting and regulating housing.

&gt;The government are building new houses, just at a sensible level and the private sector still have to sell at market rate. They also have to build a certain percentage of affordable homes.

Actually most estimates say that *despite* the level of housebuilding, the need for new houses is increasing faster than new supply. The problem isn't just staying the same, it's getting *worse*. http://www.jrf.org.uk/media-centre/shortage-homes-over-next-20-years-threatens-deepening-housing-crisis

&gt;There's so much hate for landlords on here. They're providing a service, there's nothing wrong with letting property to those who can't afford / don't want to buy and using the money as a retirement plan.

I agree, plenty of my family are landlords. I don't hate landlords and thankfully have avoided any landlords from hell. What I'm saying is that buying a house as a private individual for your primary residence, would warrant some help from the government in the case of a market shock. Repossessing families and dumping them onto a dysfunctional social housing system benefits nobody.

Landlords however, are business owners and should treat it like a business. I wouldn't be a farmer if I wasn't prepared for the government to tell me one year I need to cull all my cows because of BSE, in the same I wouldn't be a landlord if I wasn't prepared for the government to address market failures. Most reasonable business people understand that running a business entails *risk*. My brother who owns a lot of holiday property in Spain is losing around £100k a year currently, but he's not crying about it. He made money in the good times and things changed and now he's got the decision to ride it out or quit. That's the nature of business.

&gt;Building too many houses is a problem and would lead to another crash. I don't even think that they're too expensive now. As a single man fresh out of university I will be able to buy a house in the south within 2/3 years. That's not unreasonable at all. A terraced house outside London and the SE will be less than £180k on average, £130k in the midlands.

As I linked to the Joseph Rowntree report, the problem is that demand is outpacing supply increasingly. If I'm talking about those 'essential goods' again, imagine that we are a commune and we have a farming plot. We plant enough for 10 people every year, and continue to do so. But then our commune increases by 5 people, so we increase our planting to feed 12 people. This is what is currently happening. If we don't plant enough for those other 3, we are *all* going to go hungry.",0,1381233351,null,0,false,0,ccnehx6,t3_1nyzus,t1_ccnehx6,t1_ccnedth,null,1429204872,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

We could meet our housing needs pretty much simply be redeveloping existing sites, but it's prohibitively costly, risky and difficult to do so. Building on a new site is very straightforward comparatively, and there are enough non-greenbelt sites for developers to build on - it's just the case of getting them to actually pull their finger out and build them. A lot of them aren't actually built before someone has placed an order for them. They could drop the price 20% and sell loads of them, but if they did that their margin would drop.

I have mused the idea of house-building co-ops, where people interested in getting onto the property ladder put their deposit money into a fund that is used to develop sites and then sell them at cost to people in the co-op. Without the requirement for a profit margin beyond a nominal administration cost it should in theory be able to develop housing faster (and likely to better value) to meet needs.",0,1381233952,null,0,false,0,ccnelgv,t3_1nyzus,t1_ccnelgv,t1_ccne56s,null,1429204826,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

How has the story been fabricated?  

Was the attack fabricated?  
Not as far as we can tell.  

Was the quote fabricated?  
No, the doctor definitely said those words.  

Has the doctor been misrepresented in what she said?  
Possibly, although from the looks of it all that's happened is that the words ""chemical weapon"" have been edited out of one, and the end of the quote has been edited out of the other. Neither of these really change what she said to any major degree.

The source calls this a stunning bit of fakery, but nothing has been faked. The likelihood is that two different editors received the same bit of raw footage and had to edit it down for their respective stories, and they did it in slightly different ways.

- The doctor's cries of more casualties coming are contradicted by the video (""new"" casualty previously seen walking in the courtyard)
- Ahmed Darwish (previously reported as being 15 years old, now 13, an understandable error), seems to have developed burns to his upper and lower lips (2:46) which were not in evidence in the original footage

To quickly take it point by point:

&gt; The eyewitness

There's no evidence to support this claim, and even if he is reading from a cue card, so what? English likely isn't his first language and I highly doubt that he doesn't believe in what he is saying. The idea that faking spontaneity is a broadcasting misdemeanour seems crazy to me, that would make every speech ever unbroadcastable for fakery.

&gt; supposed casualties

Again no evidence of a signal. They may well be playing it up for the camera; I can see why they would do something like that, but that falls on them, not the BBC. However to propose that they're standing/resting calmly based on just two seconds of footage just doesn't stand up without more context. 

&gt; doctor's cries

This just appears to be a case of it being edited in a way that means it is no longer in chronological order, a common editing technique so that you can put explanatory voiceover over bits that don't have sound you want the audience to hear.

How can you tell? The audio has clearly been manipulated. There are two versions of the audio over the exact same piece of footage. Perhaps the doctor didn't say *either* version, and the audio is of a completely different person entirely. 

Or perhaps the doctor was confronted by some ideological managers who decided that what she said didn't fit the propaganda purposes properly, and decided that she had to rerecord her supposedly spontaneous speech to insert references to chemical weaponry - references to chemical warfare most definitely have significant propaganda connotations when it comes to the Syrian civil war, contrary to your assertion.

The film is definitely misleading, in that viewers expect that the audio and the video for these types of news footage do match each other and that we are watching a genuine reproduction of what actually happened at the time. Instances of editing ought to be obvious (such as cutting between different scenes, or voiceover/translator narration and the like).

When the broadcaster breaks the viewer's expectation like this, it brings into question the veracity of all of the output of the broadcaster. What other edits have they been making that they haven't been caught out on?

Here the strong implication is that the plea is spontaneous, whereas it's everything but. Do you, or does anybody, by contrast believe that political speeches read off papers or prompters are meant to be spontaneous? No, the BBC should rightly be more transparent in its methods.

2) How is the man in the in the white shirt lifting his hand to his lips and the others looking at the movement not a signal? And I don't at all understand your claim that it falls on them not the BBC? As if the BBC wasn't present at the time or involved in the creation? This is *precisely* where it's incumbent upon the BBC to ensure the reality of the situation is being reported, not a staged situation.

But that's the point, her bias and agenda are obvious from the video. It's because of her bias that I find the idea that the quote is fabricated highly unlikely, as why would you need to fake a quote which someone would actually say? To allege that the quote is faked in this way is similar to alleging that any quote in any news report is faked though, you need more evidence than simple editing to actually substantiate it.

I'd even venture a guess that the quote in the stock footage was:

&gt;It’s just absolute chaos and carnage here, erm we’ve had a massive influx of what looks like serious burns, er seems like it must be some sort of chemical weapon, I’m not really sure, maybe napalm, something similar to that

In which case whether it's referred to as chemical weaponry or as napalm isn't to distort the intention of the doctor's words; she intends for them to both mean the same thing.

&gt; viewers expect that the audio and the video for these types of news footage do match each other and that we are watching a genuine reproduction of what actually happened at the time

That may be the viewers expectation, but if you think that that's how it actually works you'll be surprised by the level of editing that means that things don't quite match up. It's just something that comes with the terrain. Personally I think that there's only a problem if you're actually misrepresenting a story or something someone said, of which there is little to no evidence here.

&gt; What other edits have they been making that they haven't been caught out on?

If you think an edit brings into question the BBC's veracity, I think you're actually calling into question the veracity of news media generally. This is the way it works.

The second more rolled out line is how its too expensive to buy in London.

The problem comes if they are actually making things up in support of that agenda.

What I think happened here is editing for sympathy and effect, not actual fabrication. If they were making up attacks or quotes, that would not be okay, but I'd be very surprised if that's the case here.

As to what evidence would be necessary to support a claim of fabrication, I admit it is a decently high burden (mainly because it's a very serious accusation to level at a broadcaster). You'd generally need either more footage to further substantiate claims that are rather shaky right now, or credible eyewitness reports from people that were there which contradict the report. You'll very rarely actually be able to prove fabrication from a news report itself.

About a min.

However.  I don't think it has remotely helped in it's goal.  I see lots of Pi based projects, but very few of them are educational.  The fact of the matter is, our schools are failing to teach decent computer science skills, not because of a lack of low cost single board computers.  But because of a lack of good syllabus, good teacher training etc.  If we are going to teach children to really understand a computer, you could easily do that in any Virtual Machine that would install on any School PC I've seen in the last 10 years.  They can have carte blanche, they can mess it up, one click, restored... back to state before.

It has definitely helped up the game for low cost single board machines, great if you want to stick a balloon up in to space, or wire up a bunch of web cams in your house, have a media PC... None of these are really fulfilling their original stated goal.

That isn't a bad thing.  People have made great discoveries when looking for something else (Columbus aside, without him we'd never have spray cheese).

Is there a link with corruption for this?  Most of the Americans I met studying out in the US were in favour of very strong sentences, three strike rules and the like.

My point is, they have plenty of state prisons which are overflowing too.

A lot of people who complain about private prisons do so in a manner that shows they've never arranged anything more complex than a pissup in a brewery.  If you need a facility to house say 5,000 people (see LSP!) you can't expect a private company to build it without any guarantee of occupancy.  Now this isn't about actually having people there.  Just guaranteeing to pay for it regardless.  Otherwise the private company would take on a huge risk, that is completely outside their control.

Even if its an entirely state run project (like LSP which AFAIK is the largest in the US) the state has already paid up front for all the land, construction materials, labour to build the cells.  Staffing also isn't an elastic function, it takes time to hire and train them.  So even a state run facility will be budgeted on having a minimum occupancy.

tldr: it's not the private firms behind the prisons, it's the eye-for-an-eye, lets punish not rehabilitate attitudes and racism of the voters who demand this stuff.

* Draws micro level conclusions from macro level relationships (ecological fallacy).  
* Both inequality and the other outcomes may be symptomatic of another causal influence (counfounding)
* It assumes that the causal direction is from inequality-&gt;other outcomes. The fact that all the indicators were measured at the same time means you cannot really establish a causal relationship since the temporal ordering is uncertain.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt; I suppose you could say the US prison system is a representation of capitalism in its purest and most deviant form.

Not really, as its a government funded process that puts people into it.

I would say its an example of a race to the bottom, which is inherent in many systems (top down managed economies too!).  It is something I find funny, because over a decade ago now, a lecturer in systems identification (obscure cybernetic engineering) mentioned the whole market for lemons thing, and how you can, if you are not careful, design a closed loop system which will converge onto some parameters that are perverse.  At the time I thought *pfft I get it, optimisation is complex*  But now I think I realise that he was being a little bit philosophical.

Anything that has rewards, will have problems.  The example of [LSP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_Penitentiary) has some really quite bizzare events in its history.  I don't want to get in to a 'less evil' debate.  The point is the oversite of US prisons is lacking completely.  But that is thanks to the constant way policing is sold to the US citizens.  Oddly I find that in areas of predominantly black people who lack education, they still support heavy handed sentences, punishment with no rehabilitation.

But I guess you can see why I dislike people blaming the prison privatisation thing.  It's more than that.  The way society views offenders, the way people don't want to help those.  That they don't see a meth addict as someone who needs help, only punishment.  The fact people joke about people been raped in prison.  Yeah sure, its going to be the most evil physically strong guy who gets raped isn't it, not the new, weak ones!

Which is why, in the UK I'm kind of in favour of privatised prisons.  I think they will cost the taxpayer less, which means they can also provide a higher level of service too.  Hence why I jumped on the comparison.",0,1381242547,null,0,false,0,ccngoom,t3_1nyw0w,t1_ccngoom,t1_ccnfws2,null,1429203851,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

I remember the RM Logicator (I think!) system.  It was a breakout box, 8 inputs, 8 outputs, 4 motor drivers IIRC.

There were boards, pre-made, which you wired into the device.  These boards might be something like a 2D perspex crocodile.  He would have some buttons and some LEDs.  You could write a flow chart program to connect up actions.

It's visual.   It's simple.  It's not too expensive.

You only really need 15 of those to go around a class.  The teacher probably will understand it after 1 day of training.  Kids who are a bit slow can just play with a pre-made program, others will start customising and finally make their own.

I used to teach afterschool clubs doing similar things with Lego Mindstorms, but I also taught some engineering theory too, gearing, force * distance etc.  We'd get them to make bots that could follow lines etc.  This was great.  But out of a year group of 180 students, I did this with 20.  There is no way that activity could be inclusive enough for the average class.

Which brings me back to the Pi.  It's crap for this.  No 14 year old school kid who wasn't already giftedly interested in computing needs such a device for making LEDs blink or whatever.  A PICAXE or similar is a better cheaper substitute.  Ultimately it's hard to teach flow chart programming to an average class.  Why waste money on hardware thats more powerful.  You can get ones that compile down to PICs that have a unit cost of &lt;£2.

I do love the Pi project for their achievement in making a top notch single board computer.

Depends who the opponents are.

Worth a try for a bit. Chadli/Lennon right, Townsend/Lamela left.

I'd guess because he's not a winger.

&gt;and then look to break on the counter through Defoe, Townsend, Lamela &amp; Erikson

Again, depends on how they play. Defoe's only been scoring against weak opposition, that's a fact. An extremely weakened Villa, Georgian champions, a team bottom of the Russian league and a Norwegian powerhouse. Defoe's not bad but he's not consistent enough to be relied upon.

In the beginning of that episode Amy &amp; Rory wave to each other, yes they were on a wedding anniversary journey, the doctor was supposed to take them to Rio I think. During the 2nd part of that episode Rory was touched by the ""stuff"" from the crack in the wall &amp; erased from existence. Which I think would mean he's erased from Amy's whole life, at least at the time. Until later when Rory is brought back. 

As you stated, it is awkward &amp; confusing. I would say that yes, they took they journey before they were sent back into the 40's. Most of the attempts to give them a wedding/anniversary/honeymoon journey always seem to go awry. In the Christmas special ""a Christmas carol"" Amy &amp; Rory get stuck while on a space ship/space cruise liner trying to have that trip, the doctor has to save that ship from crashing. 

There are a few mentions of the trip, but spaced out. Since the doctor &amp; therefore Amy/Rory's world is so timey-wimey I think that yes, it is possible that they took the trips even though they were stuck in 40's New York. Simply because they took those trips before they were stuck in the 40's. Timelines on DW aren't linear, things jump around a lot, so even though Amy &amp; Rory get trapped in 40's New York the things they did with The Doctor still happened. They still almost died on a space ship, Amy still met Vincent Van Gogh, Rory still spent 2000 years guarding Amy in the Pandorica. They still helped the Doctor stop a war between the humans &amp; the reptilian species in Hungry earth. 

It all happened, just in that timey-wimey, mixed up mashed up noodley soup way.

I can remember many times when Redknapp seemed clueless: not changing tactics, like-for-like subs, playing Bale on the right when it was obvious he wasn't being effective. We found it just as difficult to break down an 8 man defence and we had some odd defeats to teams we should be beating, just like Sunday. 

We also *only* used to use the wings and it frustrated the hell out of me. It relies on a great deal of luck in terms of accuracy for both the cross and the finish, it limits your options especially when they double up on the winger and they have nowhere to go as they are tight on the line. You have less vision from the wings as you have to look past so many bodies at a tighter angle and we don't have great Shearer-like strikers who are lethal with their heads. You also have no opportunity to have a shot at goal yourself.

I don't really want us going back to a defence that sits deep. We used to have too many games where it would be last ditch, heart-in-mouth defending a one goal lead. Sitting on a 1-0 lead against Chelsea is a dangerous game to play, all it takes is some bad luck and that plan is shot, better to go for 2-0 I say.

My use of pseudo relates to the fact that posting things on reddit isn't anonymous. You've acknowledged that the intelligence community can identify people. This is the pseudo I am referring to.

You are referring to anonymity between reddit users - a weaker form of anonymity. It's fine for you to use it like that if you wish, but that wasn't how I used it. I used it in the strong sense of anonymity - like encrypted VPN / freenet type of anonymity.

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"I will comment on your note about pro-zone. Stats != Tactics, so the fact that he doesn't use pro-zone has no influence on his tactical approach to the game. AVB and Mourinho are about the only ones using tactical periodization in training, does that make them more tactically aware, or greater in any way? Of course not. There is no correlation between any of those things.

Stats are just a way to gain information on the game, without context (or the correct context) they can be exceptionally misleading. Take for example Alex Song's 102/102 completed passes in his recent game for Barca, sounds like he played really well. In reality his positioning was horrendous and he was a liability for much of the game (certainly the first half). Being a scout himself I imagine AVB places much trust in the feedback from his opposition scouting network, he said as much prior to the Tromso match. If AVB has reason to believe the feedback from his scouts and coaches is good, I don't see why he needs pro-zone.

You say that he is a bit like 'Arry in that he focuses on the psychological side of the game. This is true, he tried to title himself ""the group one"" when he arrived at Chelsea and obviously takes a players mental state into consideration at all times. You just need to look at how he is handling Adebayor (and Hulk before him) to see how much he works on good relationships with players. On top of that his motivational strategies (I can bet you he will make the team re-watch that last loss over and over before the next game) show that he values man motivation.

But unlike Harry, I don't believe this is at the expense of tactical discussions. You mention yourself he assembles 100 page dossiers on a game and player comments let us know that he spends far more time talking tactics with them. His book also tells you that he has per-player DVD's made up on the next opposition, what are the strengths/weaknesses and how to get around that. That is setting up your team/players on a per match basis, that is a serious amount of effort on tactics. ***

I think someone would have to be blind not to see AVB's tactical stamp on spurs, you yourself point out the high line. That is in addition to the overlapping fullbacks, inverted winger, DM's that drop deep and sporadic pressing game. AVB's tactical philosophy is obtaining possession and quickly transitioning into attacks. It is easy to see that spurs are an example of this philosophy come to life.

You criticize the high line, but until the West Ham game spurs had the best defensive record in Europe, even after the match spurs still have the third best defensive record in the PL. Granted this,  I think the criticism is unwarranted.

On your point about not changing the line up after 45 minutes. It is exceptionally rare for any team to do this, I don't know why you would expect AVB too in this situation. You question how long spurs can continue dominating possession/shots without getting results, which ignores the fact that spurs were (and are) one match away from sitting top of the table. There has in fact been a string of great results which stretches back to the Wigan/Newcastle games last season, I don't know what else you expect? Only 1 team (City) averages more than two goals a game. 

&gt;How long can we continue to play without a natural DM? 

When one is deemed match fit. Sandro is coming back from a massive injury.

&gt;Enough with the inverted wingers - please, let's give Townsend a run out on the left so he can get some crosses in

And put who on the right? Lamela, who is still settling in and if the game in Russia is anything to go by, a while off. Or Lennon, who is injured.

&gt;Siggy - a great squad player, but not tactically aware enough to help out defensively or make movements off the ball

Replace him with who? Chadli who was injured up until now? Or Townsend, which leads you to the problem outlined above. No player on the right.

&gt;The Arsenal game seems to suggest this - I think a midfield of Capoue and Sandro could offer greater solidarity when fit, and then look to break on the counter through Defoe, Townsend, Lamela &amp; Erikson

How can you take anything from the Arsenal match. Lamela had been in the country a matter of days. Capoue got injured, Sandro was injured and Eriksen still played for Ajax. What you suggested (even if AVB wanted to do something similar) wasn't even an option.

I feel like your post is a massive knee jerk. You are highly critical of the defence, even though it is one of the best in the league (after Arsenal and Chelsea matches mind you) at the moment. You propose impossible fixes due to injuries or by offering players who don't speak English or you offer solutions that have obviously not been thought through (Townsend on the left giving nobody on the right).

EDIT:

\*\*\* Examples of AVB tactics 'Arry would never do include the switch up against City, the tall FB's against Stoke, the game built around free kicks against City (first time) last season after their results vs Ajax, pressing game vs Newcastle, the attack on Arsenals high line in the NLD etc. Both 'Arry and AVB implemented an intense pressing game vs Swansea away.",0,1381245480,null,0,1381246571,0,ccnhoah,t3_1nzhpb,t1_ccnhoah,t3_1nzhpb,null,1429203390,7,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,7

The whole point of anti-fascism is precisely that it doesn't ""tolerate"" the far-right.

&gt;Is that really going to help convince other people in the EDL, or people susceptible to extremism, to join our way of thinking?

I'll just leave this old interview with a former fascist activist here by way of reply. Emphasis mine.

&gt;The left-libertarian paper Big Flame interviewed one anti-fascist who had grown up in Wolverhampton in the 1950s, and had then supported Enoch Powell. ‘Just like lots of lads and girls, racism was attractive to me, in that it meant you could rebel against the system with the implicit support of your family . . . But **the real clincher for why I became a firm Powellite was the reaction of the middle-class, whose abstract, liberal tolerance was totally irrelevant, ill-informed and patronising.’** The correspondent could remember vividly ‘a TV discussion following on a documentary about racism in Wolverhampton in which a middle-class do-gooder from Hampstead said, “To be terribly frank, one finds the speech of the white people in Wolverhampton quite as alien as that of the ethnic minority.”’ Any effective anti-racism had to break through the link that could sometimes bind racism with elements of class feeling. ‘I still get creeps’, the Big Flame journalist wrote, ‘when I hear that “One race, the human race” line, because it allows the NF to manipulate the germ of class-consciousness in a racist direction. That’s why they try to nail the revolutionary left as “nigger lovers”, students and “do-gooders”.’""",0,1381247046,null,0,false,0,ccni91f,t3_1nz2dd,t1_ccni91f,t1_ccngl73,null,1429203121,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

The government maintains and is constantly updating a list of those jobs most in demand from industry, job-seekers can come in, get told what jobs they are already trained for, and which are available, or get told the training they could undertake to shift their career to an in demand area, whether they meet the prerequisites, and then apply for loans on a means-tested basis to undertake that training. Everyone comes out well:

* In exchange for guaranteeing a job, companies can get a potential employee trained for free, through a training scheme which they know teaches exactly the skills necessary. Obviously the employee would need to meet high minimum requirements to prove they had followed the course and were now qualified.

* In exchange for an initial investment, the government will get job-seekers off the dole, and into productive work. Potentially both eliminating benefit payments, for that person, and getting a return through loan repayments and taxation.

* In exchange for hard work, and perhaps taking out loans, the individual gets a job, a career and an income.

I think he is fantastic defensively and in the middle of the pitch, but once he gets towards the opponents box, he doesn't usually come through as he could, especially since that is how other defenses are now pressuring us.

**The US had a policy coup in 2001 in the Bush Administration.**

As stated since 1996 by Israeli and US policy advisors and politicians, the Middle East was to be cleaned out of anyone that Israel perceived to be a threat to its regional security.

**1996**

[A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Clean_Break:_A_New_Strategy_for_Securing_the_Realm)

[Here is the actual report where the information is sourced from - Paper #1](http://www.israeleconomy.org/pubs/stratpubs.htm#pap)

""A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm (commonly known as the ""Clean Break"" report) is a policy document that was prepared in 1996 by a study group led by **Richard Perle** for Benjamin Netanyahu, the then Prime Minister of Israel.[1] The report explained a new approach to solving Israel's security problems in the Middle East with an emphasis on ""Western values"". **It has since been criticized for advocating an aggressive new policy including the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq, and the containment of Syria by engaging in proxy warfare and highlighting their possession of ""weapons of mass destruction"".**

**1997**

[Project for the New American Century Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century)

[The official website](http://www.newamericancentury.org/)

""The Project for the New American Century (PNAC) was an American think tank based in Washington, D.C. established in 1997 as a non-profit educational organization founded by **William Kristol** and **Robert Kagan**. The PNAC's stated goal is ""to promote American global leadership.""[1] Fundamental to the PNAC were the view that ""American leadership is both good for America and good for the world"" and support for ""a Reaganite policy of military strength and moral clarity.""[2] With its members in numerous key administrative positions, **the PNAC exerted influence on high-level U.S. government officials in the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush and affected the Bush Administration's development of military and foreign policies, especially involving national security and the Iraq War.""**

Both these documents were written or had signatories of the same people and also after writing them they were appointed in the Bush Administration.

[List of signatories - please read this to reference later](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century#Signatories_or_contributors_to_other_significant_letters_or_reports.5B16.5D)

[Ties to the Bush Administration - read this to reference later](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century#Associations_with_Bush_administration)


[Full Iraq War timeline showing those involved](http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB326/IraqWarPart1-Timeline.pdf)


[Here is the four star general Wesley Clarke explaining how he was told that the US would attack seven countries which include Libya, Lebanon, Syria and Iran](http://youtu.be/Ha1rEhovONU)

He also mentions that the coup was done by people aforementioned above in both policy reports and the Bush Administration.

As before, these people sit on think tanks and defence boards and collect up neocon academics to write columns in newspapers, appear on TV and make the case for intervention.

[Henry Jackson Society](http://henryjacksonsociety.org/about-the-society/international-patrons-2/)

If you look at the names listed and then go back to the list of signatories link and look who wrote the Project for the New American Century, you can see it matches up with many of the names.

[The Washington Institute for Near East Policy](http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/about/board-of-advisors/)

Again, some of the same people on the board of directors.

[The Foundation for Defence and Democracies Leadership Council](http://www.defenddemocracy.org/about-fdd/team-overview/category/leadership-council)

[Board of Advisors](http://www.defenddemocracy.org/about-fdd/team-overview/category/board-of-advisors)

Same again here.

[The Weekly Standard Conservative Magazine](http://www.weeklystandard.com/)

William Kristol is an editor and they often have columns or pieces written by people from the list of signatories to The Project for a New American Century.

These institutions are often the source for 'expert opinion' in both the US and UK on news channels or newspapers. Google an experts name sometime and it can often be from one of these organisations that have the exact same people on the board of advisors or directors. This I believe is how public perception is shaped. It looks like several think tanks with 'expert analysis' by experts believe intervention is the best course of action but in reality, the message they're conveying is coming from a central group pushing a narrative.

true,Spiritisabone,null,null,"There is a substantial body of research behind the book and it has undergone robust peer review. To be sure it has been rabidly attacked by various right-wing think tanks, but, with some reservations, in actuality it's pretty good.

1) What exactly do you mean by micro level conclusions? You don't mean income inequality as a whole? 


2) Whilst it's a possibility, do you have any suggestions as to what the mysterious hidden symptom might be? The more indicators there are correlating with inequality the more credence it gives to precisely inequality being the root symptom, and that's what the authors do with their health and social index. When so many factors; education, health, violence, social mobility, etcetera all link up, it does in my mind lend credibility to the assertion that it's specifically income inequality that's the shared factor. Mind you, the authors do not claim that income inequality is the only factor at play. 

I have not encountered any better explanation of why so many problems have social gradients.


3) The authors don't jump to any simplistic causal conclusions. They do admit the problems inherent in establishing causal direction but justify the establishment of causality via epidemiological criteria (and epidemiologists have been able to show that smoking causes lung cancer, social status affects people's susceptibility to chronic disease etc.) See for instance the tracking of the US and Japan across time where the US started with high health and low inequality and has had the situation reversed, whereas the motion has been completely opposite in Japan. Pretty compelling. There can certainly be interrelations between various indicators - crime and drug use, say.

true,whistleflute,null,null,"&gt;I think someone would have to be blind not to see AVB's tactical stamp on spurs, you yourself point out the high line. That is in addition to the overlapping fullbacks, inverted winger, DM's that drop deep and sporadic pressing game. AVB's tactical philosophy is obtaining possession and quickly transitioning into attacks. It is easy to see that spurs are an example of this philosophy come to life

I'm not sure you've understood me, I clearly highlight AVB brought his philosophy of football with him. The whole point of my post was that he doesn't sacrifice or alter this philosophy for anyone. Most of your response fails to understand this simple point. It's incredibly naive to think that a brand of philosophy doesn't adapt depending on whether you're playing against Hull city or Man City. 

&gt;You criticize the high line, but until the West Ham game spurs had the best defensive record in Europe, even after the match spurs still have the third best defensive record in the PL. Granted this, I think the criticism is unwarranted.

You just said stats can be misleading and then quote this as a response. I feel like i must be watching different games because the high-line has been on the verge of being broken in nearly every game. Lloris was lucky not to be send of when handled outside the area, the next game he made a great tackle at the feet of the striker. He again played outstanding to keep Arsenal at only one goal. The high-line was run ragged by Chelsea in the second half. There are as many examples of the trap being sprung as there off Siggy shooting just wide, or Defoe fluffing his lines. We have the 5th worst amount of goals scored, does that even us out to a mid-level team? /s

&gt;How can you take anything from the Arsenal match

You may think so, but it was informative nonetheless (e.g. he set out the same as NLD at WHL last season). Our back line was almost identical to last season, but still struggled massively with Giroud and Walcott.

&gt;On your point about not changing the line up after 45 minutes. It is exceptionally rare for any team to do this, I don't know why you would expect AVB too in this situation. You question how long spurs can continue dominating possession/shots without getting results, which ignores the fact that spurs were (and are) one match away from sitting top of the table.

Is there any stat more meaningless than table positions after 7 games? By that logic Southampton are a top-4 team. You also completely fail to take into account the fact that we've only played Chelsea &amp; Arsenal out of the top 6 so far (every other team barring Arsenal have played 3+ games) taking one point. Again, not making changes after 45 minutes - other people don't do it so we shouldn't? Mata at half-time in the chelsea game. I'm not advocating 45 minute half time changes to be pro-active, but he can at least be more reactive when other teams do it.

&gt;When one is deemed match fit. Sandro is coming back from a massive injury.

Sandro must be fit enough if he was allowed to play the full 90 minutes against Anzhi after 10+ hours of travelling on one of the worst pitches I've ever seen.

&gt;And put who on the right?

Siggy, Holtby, Defoe. The argument is not simply about playing a natural wide player, but adapting to the game (e.g. the lop-sided nature of our attack and West-Ham's defines). Even switching Siggy and Townsend on the pitch would of at least of been a bit more interesting.

&gt; Or Townsend, which leads you to the problem outlined above. No player on the right. Townsend on the left giving nobody on the right

No, because then they are both crossing with their stronger foot than cutting inside. That's the point, christ. Even if it was just as lop-sided, Townsend would be crossing rather than shooting.

&gt; I feel like your post is a massive knee jerk

I feel like your post is just a bunch of mangled statistics trying to desperately excuse AVB of any fault ever. You are the sort of person who thinks back to the NLD derby as WHL last season as evidence of how great the high line is, but completely fail to remember Arsenal's threat in that game. It's not a 100% perfect system all the time. See here for some education:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJyIwOlwy00

You paradoxically say that our defense is one of the best in the league based on a few games against lower placing teams, but when I mention that against these same teams we've struggled to score, it's invalid? Only the bottom four teams have scored less goals than us. We've struggled to score goals throughout 2013 barring Bale. How long will it be before every team man-marks Erikson out of the game, or shows Townsend down the line?

Reading your garbage gives me the impression that you have a checklist of cliche British nonsense that you're going down, ticking all the boxes. 

Chelsea in free-fall under Benitez? Are you fucking retarded? 11 points higher than they were the season before and a Europa League title? We went backwards? Our highest ever point total in the Premier League after drastically altering the team and bringing in a new manager?

You've got it miserably fucking wrong. The season of missed opportunity was the PREVIOUS one. You might have blocked it from your memory, lest the mystique of Redknapp be damaged. 

Do you remember 2011 / 2012? When Chelsea actually WERE in free fall under AVB and RDM? When Arsenal were in free fall and 10 points back with less than two months to play? Do you know who our manager was then, and what he was doing? Do you even care about your club being threatened publicly in the name of contract negotiations? 

You really honestly think what happened last season-- missing out to title-contending form Arsenal-- was the big disaster of the last few years? Shit, we didn't even come close to collapsing. Only two teams had better form than us in the second half of last season. In the entire 20 odd year history of the Premier League we are one of 2 or 3 teams to ever miss out on top 4 with over 70 points. 

There's really nothing I can say to doom merchants who still pine for Redknapp. Go post on Facebook with the other mongs. Or stick to whoring karma by being aggressively negative about your own club on /r/soccer.

However I do not agree with their conclusion. They say that it's the result of 30 years of growing inequality. This implies that a wealth distribution gap is a relatively new thing. 

It most certainly is not. It's a historic problem that goes back to the very founding of societies. However following WW1 and until perhaps the 70s or 80s the situation improved massively.

Since then people on average have become much, much more wealthy, but we've also sadly allowed the richest to grab from the poorest.

In Thatcher's day I don't think ""the gap"" which she famously derided labour about was so bad it needed action - in fact you could well argue that you can't increase prosperity across the board without increasing the gap. However at some point between the 80s and 2013 the gap has become so large that it's wrong.

My opinion is that there have been a number of steps which have been corrupt, and politicians have either been complicit or inept.

Many of the privatisations and PFI, in my view, have been done to line ministers pockets and have resulted in the poor getting poorer.

There is a vast, inordinate amount of tax on the poorest people through VAT, green fuel taxes etc.

A family is expected to work much longer hours than ever before, and the remuneration has not kept pace. Sure families may be richer on the whole, but who has really benefited from it - the very rich.

The answer is not socialism though. It's liberalism. It's kneecapping the lobbies, and massive corporations with their hand in the till. It's putting corrupt politicians in jail. It's government by elected people who listen to experts not dismiss them. It's spending the money to deal with deep seated problems in society, rather than the social democrat way of paying them more money to stay poor, or the neoliberal way of victim blaming and taking away their benefits.
