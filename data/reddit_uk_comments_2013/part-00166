&gt;Saddam Hussein was forced to destroy the chemical and biological weapons.

If he was doing this, do you really think he wasn't stockpiling chemical and biological weapons as well?

7.20 Get up, shower, get dressed in my school uniform.

8.00 Eat breakfast. Usually cereal (I used to eat a lot of Shreddies), sometimes toast in addition. Always a cup of tea. (Whoever was up first would make a pot for everyone.) Watch the morning news on TV while eating.

8.20 My friend who lived nearby would arrive at my house. We walked to school together. If the weather was bad or we didn't feel like walking we would catch a public bus.

8.50 Arrive at school. We had 6 lessons per day each 50 minutes. At the age of 16 I had lessons in English, Maths, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Religious Studies, Geography, French, German and PE.

10.50-11.10 Morning break. I would often eat a sandwich from my lunchbox. Commonly people ate crisps, chocolate or fruit at this time.

12.50 Lunch time. I finished off my sandwiches from home. (Sometimes I made them, sometimes my mum did.) The school canteen was also an option for hot or cold food. We were not allowed to leave school premises for lunch before sixth form (the last two years of school, age 16-18.) My school had quite a lot of options for lunchtime clubs to participate in, from sports to chess, electronics etc. Generally they started at 1pm so you had to eat lunch very quickly first.

14.00 Afternoon lessons

15.40 End of school. There were after school clubs too but I can't think of any that I participated in. You could also stay after school to study in the library if you wanted, until 5pm. They ran a couple of extra buses just after 5 to pick up anybody who stayed.

16.15 I got home. I would get changed and have a cup of tea and a couple of biscuits while watching TV. Then about 5 o'clock I went out on my bike to deliver the evening newspaper.

18.00 My mum served dinner. She did it at 6 so we could watch the BBC news as we ate in the living room. Some typical dinners we used to eat: spaghetti bolognese, chicken and rice, sausages with mashed potato and baked beans, cottage pie with peas or beans, chicken pie with boiled potatoes and carrots, pizza and chips. I still eat all of these things but I think my cooking is a little more sophisticated than my mother's.

19.00 I would have homework to do and plan that around anything I wanted to see on TV, and time spent on the computer. I rarely went out on weekday evenings as a teenager.

22.00 or around then, get ready for bed, I would then read for a while before sleep",0,1376306050,null,0,false,0,cbm260o,t3_1k74ue,t1_cbm260o,t3_1k74ue,null,1429858504,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Business rates is one of the fairer taxes; and should be higher in London where location value is higher.  VAT and employer's national insurance are the ones to start reducing.

Even better -- offer tax incentives for non-South East locations in the UK to get some spreading out of the GDP.  Why there is any employer's national insurance in towns and cities that have high unemployment, has yet to be adequately explained to me.

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"Granted spurs midfield trio of Dembele - Sandro - Paulinho and its defensive nature the question has to be asked, where are the goals and creativity going to come from?

The answer must lie with the front 3, a striker and wide men capable of whipping in crosses, linking up with the FB and also cutting in to provide a immediate goal threat.

Without question we have one of those boxes ticked with Bale, I certainly imagine one of Chadli/Townsend/Lennon will rise to the challenge of locking down the other role over the course of the season which means striker (prolific!) is the final piece of the puzzle.

The player needs to have the following qualities, which I believe Soldado has:

- Movement off the ball to drag defenders. This will open up channels for the wide men to attack when they cut in. 

- Ability to finish off balls crossed into the box. Something I think all front men need is 'end product', whether that is the ability to cross, shoot or assist. What point is whipping in 10 quality crosses a game if you don't have the front man to bang them in. Soldado boasts a very respectable conversion %.

- Ability to bend the line. This means riding the shoulders of the centre backs and constantly making dangerous runs which force them to be on their toes (restricting any sort of offence from the back). Furthermore, a striker that will punish out of position defenders means that it is far tougher for the opposition to shuffle the back line around to accommodate Bale. Remember how UTD inadvertently unleashed Lennon at WHL last season because they doubled up on Bale, they can't do that anymore as they run the risk of unleashing a 20+ goals a season striker.

- Ability to link up play. There is no point in boasting the likes of Paulinho and Dembele in midfield if they are unable to connect to the front three. The striker needs to be able to use both his movement and passing to open up the lines between midfield and attack. For example, Dembele runs through midfield, Soldado drops back to collect the ball (drags a CB). Bale cuts in from the right into the newly created space providing a line for attack. This play is only possible with an alert and skilful striker.

So, I do believe Soldado will be a perfect fit in spurs colours, but I think he will take a while to get there. I was at the game on the weekend and something I don't beleive the cameras picked up was just how much of a communication issue Soldado faced. He clearly doesn't speak basic English and Chadli/Lennon/Townsend/Bale/Dembele likely don't speak much Spanish. Communication is key and while the player learns both the team and the language I expect to see a number of frustrating teething issues.",0,1376306922,null,0,false,0,cbm2ajt,t3_1k76u9,t1_cbm2ajt,t3_1k76u9,null,1429858445,12,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,12

Similarly, police taking an interest and monitoring to prevent crimes such as vehicle theft can go a long way.

true,hughk,eu,European Union/Yorks,"Killing your own population is frowned upon, but it does not invalidate your claim to statehood in the UN. Too many countries would have issues with this. Saddam was a very nasty man but there are plenty of others around.

Btw, I deliberately selected Halabjah because it was a Rubicon type event with 7 to 8000 casualties (there was also Al Faw with similar numbers). There were smaller events before as well as smaller events afterwards only ending with the imposed settlement after the invasion of Kuwait. After that, no CBW attacks were made and any stores found intact later would be insufficient to be any significant threat.

Intervention on behalf of the Marsh Arabs or even the Kurds could have been a reason but it was never given. It should again have happened back in the early nineties.

&gt; I'll gladly accept the point that the intervention would have been more welcome the earlier it was; but just because we didn't do it in the eighties doesn't mean we shouldn't have done it when we did.

You deal with something that they have done, but not for something that they might have done. Yes, he persecuted the Marsh Arabs especially after 91 when they had been encouraged to revolt by George Bush (Sr)'s speeches. Again, their could have been intervention to protect them.

Saddam saw himself as a regional ""tough guy"". It was in his interest that his neighbours (especially Iran) considered him better equipped than them. In real terms, Saddam had been contained with the Kuwait war but he needed some diplomatic ambiguity in order to play the big boy. He didn't care so much about being open with the US or even the UN as long as his neighbours didn't understand how weak he was.

The problem is that from 2001 Bush was looking for a way to link Iraq with 9/11 or to show they were a clear and present danger. Of course, there was no link, but he could still use WMD and a linkage to Al Quaeda (Forgetting Middle East 101, the one thing that Sunnis hate more than Israelis are Shia Muslims and secularists. Al Quaeda is Sunni. Iraq's Baathist regime was secularist, with a large number of Shia in the population.

The diversion of so many resources to the intelligence community takes us into a dangerous world where paranoid fantasies are rewarded financially. Remember Graham Greene's excellent ""Our Man in Havana"" was supposed to be fiction, and not a game plan.

The last ""crime"" was to consider Afghanistan to be sufficiently solved militarily and to confuse winning the battle with winning the war. This regrettably requires boots on the ground and the diversion of many of them as well as the attention of high command to Iraq would compromise the ""normalisation"" of Afghanistan. This allowed the Taliban to grow in strength, and the persecution of women educators and their students. This would end up being the second time that Afghanistan had been badly let down by the US/UK with the first time being the failure to provide assistance after the Soviets withdrew.

&gt; Saddam was still going after a nuclear weapon until the regime was overthrown; 

Says who? All the post GW2 evidence collected suggests that the nuclear programme was shutdown in the early nineties. The alleged purpose of the centrifuge tubes turned out to be unsuitable for purification and actually for the construction of short range rockets for the battlefield. The purification of uranium for use in WMD or even to reprocess your own fuel requires significant resources. As for CBW, it is possible to make them in a school lab. However, it is not possible to make them in militarily useful quantities without larger facilities. You would need to manufacture tens to hundreds of tonnes.

And what did Blair do? He provided uncritical support to the whole thing and even used his own office to suppress dissenting opinions. The truth didn't matter, he believed and at least 100K Iraqis died because of his and GWB's unwavering beliefs.

...and yes, there are plenty of stupid pedestrians / cyclists / cars / trucks / hovercraft around. There's always someone. My issue is that (the city) doesn't over-concern itself with protecting one demographic at the cost of all the others - and instead teaches some self governing in encouraging people not to take stupid risks, whatever their preferred way of getting around. 

Cars may have air-bags but pedestrians and cyclists also easily forget they're soft and squishy! 

I wouldn't say cars days are numbered at all; there's too much road infrastructure for them to fall out of favour all together, with ample car parks around and large truck roads around and through Birmingham itself. Moving over to public transport may see an increase but since that's just another form of automotive road use (in buses, at least) - it's imperative that the infrastructure of the city still accommodate that and not become over-focussed on cyclists alone.

true,farnz,eu,"Oxon, England","This is partly a consequence of the way the construction and use regulations affect speedos. They're allowed to read high by up to 10% of the true speed plus 10kph, but must never read low (i.e. if you're doing a true 30 MPH, the speedo must read at least 30, and not more than 39); the way UNECE regulation 39 (and its EU counterpart) is written requires this to be true for all manufacturer approved wheel and tyres sizes, plus prohibits underreading even if you fit unapproved wheels and tyes as long as no bodywork has to be modified to make the combination fit.

As a result, vehicles with big wheel arches tend to always read high - the manufacturer is ensuring that if the wheel and tyre fits, the speedo will not read low. If there are multiple approved wheel and tyre sizes, you may see different results with different combinations - there's probably one where the error is tiny (1% or less).

Many new passenger cars are designed to only take approved wheel and tyre sizes that have the same rolling circumference when fitted, filling the wheel arches so that you can't fit bigger tyres and throw the calculations off, so that when you use a manufacturer-approved combination, the error is tiny.

Separately, you have the ACPO guidelines, which give you 10% + 2 MPH of leeway on most speed cameras - the idea here is to give you enough leeway that if your speedo is accurate, but you've drifted slightly over due to expected human error (e.g. not noticing your speed creep up as the road begins to slope down), you have time to correct by reducing power without the cameras getting you.",0,1376310457,null,0,false,0,cbm2vzw,t3_1k5oyo,t1_cbm2vzw,t1_cblnowy,null,1429858167,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Genocide, plus transnational crime and terrorism can invalidate statehood in the UN's eyes, it's certainly enough to make you a rogue state.

&gt;Saddam was a very nasty man but there are plenty of others around.

Hell of an understatement, but yes. And morally, if we're in a position to make the other tyrants and maniacs lives' difficult, we should.  This doesn't invalidate the reasons for ousting Saddam, or repudiate the progress that has been made since in any way.  It's just a wake-up call that democracies should be doing more on the world stage with regards to this sort of thing. 

&gt;The problem is that from 2001 Bush was looking for a way to link Iraq with 9/11 or to show they were a clear and present danger. Of course, there was no link, but he could still use WMD and a linkage to Al Quaeda

Whatever the reasons Blair and Bush gave, the end of the means is clear; Iraq is better than it was under Saddam.  

&gt;(Forgetting Middle East 101, the one thing that Sunnis hate more than Israelis are Shia Muslims and secularists.

And the one thing they hate more than each other is Western progressive democracy.  Whether or not you can explicitly link Saddam to Al Qaedea -  you can link him to international crime, terrorism and gangsterism.  He was trying to buy chemical weapons and nuclear materials off the shelf from North Korea for one example. 

&gt;Says who?

[Scientists involved in the program](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Bomb-My-Garden-Mastermind/dp/0471741272).  Whether or not he was actually ready to deploy nuclear weapons or not seems irrelevant to me.  He was going after them, eventually he would have developed them, or bought them off the shelf. 

&gt;The truth didn't matter, he believed and at least 100K Iraqis died

How many died in Halabjah? How many Marsh Arabs? How many people for expressing dissenting opinions?  How many when he annexed Kuwait?  How many more from other countries when he felt ready to be the aggressor in the region again?  Would an internal Iraqi civil war have killed any less?  

&gt;The truth didn't matter, he believed...because of his and GWB's unwavering beliefs.

It's not their beliefs I support; it's the end result of the war - democracy in a place once blighted by tyranny and oppression.  It's progress however you cut it.

Now I'm not trying to be part of the NIMBY brigade, but having a history in environmental/renewable energy technologies shows that there are a number of much better, *sustainable* methods of energy production from within the shores of these fair lands. 

Why, is Westminster et al. trying to destroy the country over a couple of barrels of oil? The fracking refineries won't exist before the expected energy shortfall in 2015/6 following the decommissioning of nuclear powerstations, in fact, nothing will; so why are those who are elected to make decisions for the common good intent on poisoning the country? 

NB that, I suspect, if the shale deposits were under London, then this may be a different story...

The gist of it is this: when business rates go up, land rents go down.  When business rates go down, land rents go up pound for pound -- any reduction in business rates will therefore go into the landlord's pocket, not the tenant’s.  An understanding of supply-demand curves and why things have a particular price should make it pretty clear why that is so.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"The thing that strikes me about Soldado (having seen him a bit in Spain plus the Espanyol game) is that he has that tremendous instinct of where and when to be somewhere on the pitch.  He times his runs perfectly he moves to a position to be a threat at exactly the right time.  He works to be threat at all times.  And all of it is done instinctively, its beyond years of practice its much more natural than that.

Its simialr to the way VDV moved when he was with us where so often he was just where he needed to be, he made the pass to someone before most would even recognize the opportunity was there, he was lined up perfectly to create a chance without it seeming robotic.  Its a world class instinct that can't be learned.  You either have it or you don't and Soldado looks like he has it.

Now this is fantastic for us, we haven't had this type of threat here since Berba moved on.  I do however wonder if our midfield will be able to take full advantage of it though. I think of Suarez at Liverpool who aside from being a colossal twat has that same killer instinct who you see openly getting frustrated because he was somewhere before anyone surrounding even thought to give him the opportunity or Cazorla who makes that amazing pass and completely catches a teammate completely unprepared.  

All of these players are capable of making something occur regardless but they are capable of so much more but they are not surrounded by the same talent.  i wonder if our midfielders (as good as they are..and they are VERY good) will be able to catch up to how Soldado moves and reacts to a situation to really take advantage of his ability.

That being said, Henry and Rodgers have (had?) made it abundantly clear that Suarez is not for sale.  The more times Rodgers comes out to basically restate that Suarez needs to apologize in public, the more he ends up antagonizing Suarez, and in my opinion, makes Suarez LESS likely to ""capitulate"" and get on with it.  

On a related note, I think it's entirely possible that Suarez is still for sale to interested foreign parties, and Rodgerx can use the convenient excuse that Suarez hadn't apologized, and thus, wouldn't be able to play as a reason for the eventual sale.

I expect those three, and possibly Capoue, will rotate through two midfield spots with Siggy/Holtby playing in an CAM role. This would allow defensive stability, while allowing an attacking midfielder to have more freedom and creativity. 

Also, Bale likes to roam around the front line, playing on the left, right and sometimes sliding in behind the striker. By using a CAM, we allow him to do this more easily, as Siggy/Holtby are more than capable of playing out wide for periods of time even if it is out of position.

So while we may see that powerful midfield trio used sometimes, I don't think it will be too regular of an occurrence. Squad rotation will protect their health for a long season, while providing valuable playing time to our other young midfielders who are able to provide the attack with the creativity it needs.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_housing

&gt;Affordable housing is housing deemed affordable to those with a median household income.

&gt;When the monthly carrying costs of a home exceed 30–35% of household income, then the housing is considered unaffordable for that household.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_in_the_United_Kingdom

&gt;average income for working-age households was around £33,000

30% * £33,000 
= £9,900 a year
= £825 a month

If your household expenses are over £825 a month then it's not classed as affordable housing. I don't know whether it includes council tax, water and utilities in that. There's also the divide between London and the rest of the UK.

For example in Gloucestershire where I live, household median is £23,314, so the criteria for affordable housing is a spend of £582.85 a month - I can tell you that doesn't get you a whole lot round here.

during the pre season we're in contact daily with players to get them prepared for the upcoming season and let them know training schedules,  travel arrangements, catching up such and such non stop.. 

With all this transfer drama BR has spoken to Suarez directly quite a bit and although the phone conversations seem to indicate an understanding BR cant stop Suarez talking to the press, he's kind of letting suarez get on with it and returning in favor with a 'two can play at that game' 

sometimes the press can get the jist of whats being said between player and manager but 9/10 times (especially the ones i know about personally) have been blown up and sensationalized, I know that Telegraph interview caught us at the club by surprise because he had said he would talk to us more when BR returned. 

without putting words in their mouths, most players have been professional about it because some know what its like to have that temptation/can sympathise but they are fully aware of whats happening and whats being said and while they'll leave personal feelings at the door when training or playing there is certainly some tension (best example i can think of is Daniel Agger and Skrtel not making eye contact or acknowledging him after coming past the boot room, made me feel awkward)

He's very obviously available and we were strongly linked with him, but no action came from it.  We've clearly moved on.

Virgin runs its own fibre network exclusive to Virgin.  You can get speeds of up to 100mbps

BT Open reach sells copper ADSL and Fibre to BT and most other companies (meaning that you are likely getting the same service but through whatever company you are choosing).  BT Fibre (Infinity) has speeds up to 60mbps.  ADSL connection is lossy and depends on your location to the exchange (can be between 0.5mbps-20mbps). 

Some exchanges have LLU (companies can put their own equipment in the exchange and not piggy back BT) offering a slight variation in speeds on the ADSL network.  This is likely for companies such as Sky, Orange etc.

true,iamPause,lfc68,,"Preface: The following is pure speculation.

Football is a business, and a big part of business negotiations are power and leverage.  As with any negotion there are promises, threats, bluffs, etc made to try to improve your position.

Of of these big things on the table is what will and won't be talked about publicly. 

We can look at any transfer season and see this. We can see a player say they are staying at the club in order to win over (or keep) fans in their corner, only to be sold/hand in a transfer request later.

This isn't a lie, per se, but it is a tool to keep people in your corner in case other plans don't work out.

Why? Because public perception is massively important.

At times public statements can be exactly what you said they are, to send a message.  We all know that negotiations and contract language are supposed to be private; that transfer season is a bit like hotdogs: you might like them, but you don't want to know how they are made.

But in liu of this, you may make a statement because you feel it is the only way to be heard.  ""If you don't allow me to talk to X club, I will go to the press.""

This is a dangerous threat. If a player goes to the press and says ""I would like to talk to other teams but my greedy owners/coachs won't let me"" that is absolutely huge. They are admitting publicly that they are turning their back on the fans and the club and they are risking their relationship for the manager who might just end up benching the player if they stay.

Imagine sending a press release to your boss saying ""I am looking for other jobs.""  How long do you think you'd keep your current one?

On the flip side, we have people our owner putting out black/white statements like ""We will not sell Suarez.""  Sure, they might have said the same thing to the Gunners, but a lot of times that is negotiation-speak for ""not at that price.""

By making a public statement it shows that they mean business, because of NESV sells now then they have publicly gone back on their word and it makes any future statements (about anything) that much less reliable because, ""if they took back X, what is stopping them from reversing their decision on Y?""

**tl;dr**

**Public statements serve two purposes:**

1. Gain fan support

2. Solidify statements that were made in the back room (at risk of your own reputation).",0,1376313063,null,0,false,0,cbm3fbp,t3_1k78r0,t1_cbm3fbp,t1_cbm2zsx,null,1429857916,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

I don't think a genocide is defined purely by numbers.  It's an attempt to eradicate an ethnic group, however large or small. 

&gt;The only thing that has been liberated in Iraq

Patently not true.  Even while forces were still on the ground, people were protesting against them.  Protesting with the knowledge that they wouldn't be tortured or killed for descent; enjoying and exercising their freedom of speech that they never had under Saddam.

&gt;Afterwards the only persons who made claims have been since discredited as fabricators.

As far as I know, Mahdi Obeidi has not been dismissed as a fabricator; I'd accept proof otherwise though.  It still doesn't alter Saddam's self-expressed aim to become a nuclear power. 

&gt;You mean that the end justifies the means?

I can understand people arguing the means; and I know many people oppose the view that we should have gone to war; but I don't think many people are sorry on behalf of the Iraqis' that the Hussein clan is no longer in charge.  Civil war would have come to Iraq sooner or later anyway; it would have been even bloodier; and possibly even more protracted than our intervention.

I'd also add that David Villa is probably too old these days to be worth it and Benteke has had 1 good season and at £25m would have been a big risk.  

In the case of Moutinho and Damiao, what slowed the deal down is not waiting till the last minute it's the issue of 3rd party ownership which isn't allowed in the premier league. Whilst yes Moutinho was a loss to miss out on there's no guarantee that considering we have no CL he would have wanted to come anyway. You could also say that considering Damiao's current form we dodged a bullet there.  

I think it's harsh to describe that as a habit. We sold Carrick at the end of July which is hardly last minute. Berbatov and Modric we only sold last minute and got top money (£66m between them) for them. VDV is an odd one. But again it's a player wanting to leave and we still made a £2m profit on him...

true,hughk,eu,European Union/Yorks,"&gt;I don't think a genocide is defined purely by numbers. It's an attempt to eradicate an ethnic group, however large or small. 

These were not ethnic groups but rather sections of population. Some of whom may have been in an ethnic group. Saddam essentially went for anyone not Baathist and loyal, be it Kurd or Marsh Arab or just people who are unfortunate to live in a particular village.

Personally I would actually quite like a broadly worded declaration from the UN against countries killing off their own populations. This would cause some headaches whether historical (Turkey, China) or actual. The point is there must be no exceptionalism. One rule for all.

&gt;Patently not true. Even while forces were still on the ground, people were protesting against them. Protesting with the knowledge that they wouldn't be tortured or killed for descent;

Ah, the bombings.

&gt;As far as I know, Mahedi Obedi has not been dismissed as a fabricator; I'd accept proof otherwise though. It still doesn't alter Saddam's self-expressed aim to become a nuclear power. 

According to the CIA the programme halted in 1991. He claims they were close, but I doubt it if the centrifuges and other equipment could be buried in his garden. Iran incidentally has 3000 centrifuges in 24 cascades and has not amassed enough weapons grade material for a critical mass. I guess, he has a pretty big garden to hide even one whole cascade of 60 or so centrifuges. Defectors love to exaggerate as it increases their chances of being accepted (and helps with the book rights). I am certain there is some truth there too, but there are no sources other than his own testimony.

&gt; Civil war would have come to Iraq sooner or later anyway; it would have been even bloodier; and possibly even more protracted than our intervention. 

Does that gives us the right to intercede in advance? This is a very slippery slope and why do we look at country A versus country B? As I said when I talked about genocide, perhaps we do need some established processes at UN level, so any intercession is quicker when needed and with the right numbers (for example, as we failed to do in Rwanda). Also, we end up in a situation where it is difficult to see where intervention is possible, for example Syria where both sides have some rather unfortunate elements fighting for them and the civilian population is suffering.",0,1376317457,null,0,false,0,cbm4k2p,t3_1k64th,t1_cbm4k2p,t1_cbm3u5c,null,1429857388,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I am a researcher working on DSL technologies, I should hope that I know what I'm talking about.

You've misunderstood LLU there. LLU is not a technology meant to increase speeds, it's meant to remove the reliance upon BT so as to avoid price fixing. Just recently, it's become possible to get a local loop that's not owned by Openreach as others have started to be allowed to maintain them.

ADSL is not inherently lossy. Copper cables are lossy over long distances or bad cables.

Speeds around 0.5Mbps to 2Mbps are likely not due to loss but due to the use of an older 20CN line.

21CN lines can handle speeds of 28Mbps quite well, especially over distances less than one mile.

The difference is in the contention ratio. The major ISPs all oversubscribe their trunks and you might be sharing your trunk with 50-100 other users. This is fine if you're just browser web pages and checking your email but add in on-demand video and the whole thing falls apart.

We can stop that by ensuring wells don't fail, are properly cemented and inspected by experts before any fracking takes place. In the UK there are three separate well casings in each borehole between the well and any aquifer, we also have well inspection teams who inspect wells before any fracking can take place.

The point is moot anyway, the only fluids used in fracking currently allowed to be used by the EA are:

* Water

* Polyacrylamide (used in drinking water treatment, non-toxic)

* HCl (used in very dilute concentrations to dissolve any loose concrete after drilling, non-toxic)

* Biocide (used in small concentrations, used in water treatment)

* Sodium salt

At the moment Cuadrilla has been using a solution with 99.95 per cent water, 0.04 per cent polyacrylamide and a trace amount of salt. You could drink that solution and be perfectly fine.

true,winter_mute,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"&gt;These were not ethnic groups

I think the Kurds are ethnically distinct from Iraqis to the south; but essentially I think we're in agreement that killing your own population is morally abhorrent whatever their ethnicity.  And yes, I agree the UN should be much more on the ball.

&gt;Ah, the bombings.

I confess, I'm not sure what you're driving at there?

I agree with most of what you're saying about defectors; but the fact Saddam was even trying for a nuclear weapon, and had *some* infrastructure in place is unnerving; and it's just as unnerving knowing that Iran and North Korea are trying too.

&gt;Does that gives us the right to intercede in advance? This is a very slippery slope and why do we look at country A versus country B? As I said when I talked about genocide, perhaps we do need some established processes at UN level

Yeah, I think this is pretty much where our difference in opinion lies; Saddam was a disgusting tyrant, but should we intercede, and if so when?  Morally, I think be happy to see intervention anywhere that it was required, but common sense says resources and political will wouldn't allow it.   

Now, you're probably going to spit your tea about this one, but I'm forming the opinion (not all the way there yet), that intervention is Syria is even more clear cut is some ways than Iraq.  Helping to crush an obviously popular rebellion isn't the way to go; and arming the theocratic nutcases that make up much of the Free Syrian Army isn't really an option either.  Meanwhile, innocent people are being dragged into their back gardens and executed in front of their families because they're Shiite, or for any other number of fatuous reasons.  I'm not a warmongering type; but sitting back and allowing these things to happen both morally speaking and in terms of British self-interest seems absolutely wrong.

&gt;Personally I would actually quite like a broadly worded declaration from the UN

The UN needs teeth. Weapons inspections in Iraq were hampered by French vetoes of the threat of force.  Syrian arms shipments continue, and any sanctions are hampered by the Russian veto.

In 1704 4,000 of the Spanish population voluntarily left expecting Castilian forces to be preparing to retake the rock after being offered religious and social freedom in exchange for declaring loyalty to the Habsberg rather than Bourbon claimant to the throne. Spanish people were not banned from speaking their language, observing their religion or moving back to Gibraltar. There was not a deliberate 'anglification' of Gibraltar, as can be borne out by its diverse population, as there was in Tibet as part of the cultural revolution. Sinicization was a stated objective of the Chinese government post-1980 and Tibet has faced challenges to freedom of religious observance, mass population transplantation, a banning of teaching in the native language in schools and political violence. Everything post 1959 for Tibet has been pretty bad.

The reasons for the seizing of each territory were even different, with Gibraltar intended to be a bargaining chip for Charles III to leverage what he saw as his crown from Philip of Anjou- it was only the strategic importance of Gibraltar against Barbary pirates and the confederacy's failure to see Charles 'restored' to the throne that saw the Britain claim the territory permanently.

No, and I'm not sure where I said that exactly. I did say that unemployment was **relatively** lower in the South-East, and higher in other regions. Which would seem to be borne out by the last ONS regional labour market statistics, which found that:

* The employment rate was highest in the South East (74.8%) and lowest in the North East (66.6%)
* The claimant count rate was lowest in the South East (2.7%) and highest in the North East (7.2%)

While obviously there is variation within these regions, at a regional aggregate level I'm not quite sure where the delusion is.

true,roontish12,dalek,Dalek,"""The Doctor"" is a title that he chose for himself. A Time Lords real name supposedly holds great power, and many of them are given titles to be referred to as, instead of using their names, like the other Time Lord, The Master, who is an old enemy of the Doctors. There was lots of speculation and fan theories on what his true name was and what it means coming up to the end of season 7 when the last episode was called ""The Name Of The Doctor"". This ended up being a play on words, as in, ""In the name of justice"" sort of thing. We don't know what his real name is or why it's never revealed (so far). The reason River Song knows his name is because she is his wife. This is one of the mysteries of the show that keep people watching. While the Doctor is many things, he certainly is a doctor of a medical type. There are many instances of him discovering cures and healing people, one I can remember off the top of my head is in the episode Daleks Take Manhatten. A side character is mutated by the Daleks [into a pig slave](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120915145825/tardis/images/5/57/Laszlo_as_a_Dalek_Pig_Slave.jpg). This process is usually fatal, however while the Doctor was not able to reverse the pig mutation, he was able to keep Laslo (the pig mutated character) alive and at the episode it's shown he can still live a normal lifespan. Another example is in episode New Earth, when there are thousands of diseased people in a zombie like state going around infecting people. The Doctor figures out how to cure everyone.

That said, there are plenty of places in East, South and North London where it's quite possible to get a place for around the £250K mark. While that may seem expensive, it's not unnacheivable given the average London Joint income. I'm not currently in the position to buy - too much leftover debt, however since moving to London from Dorset, my income and chances of buying have improved dramatically. It may need a year of scrimping, but it is do-able. 

The key difference here is the willingness to commute. It's certainly possible to buy in, say Walthamstowe, but there are simply too many people living in Zones 1 and 2, so it's become much harder to rent there. Of course there is migrating gentrification, so prices are rising in outer areas, and more should be done to protect the homes of people living on lower incomes/benefits, but for the average working couple in their mid 20s-mid 30s, it's possible to own as long as you are willing to live outside of a certain radius.

- You really have to know your stuff about the company / job. I don't mean you have to know every aspect about the job, a lot of that will come in training, but checking out the website at least is a must do. My current job, the company had a merger about six months before my interview, so I mentioned that (it was one of my questions) 
- Always have some questions ready to ask. Four/five should do it. Feel free to write them down beforehand (I impressed both employers at the end of the interview by asking ""actually I do have some questions, do you mind if I get my pad of paper/whatever?"". Some of them may be answered during the interview, but you can mention it was one of your questions if you like. For type of question, focus on things like what the atmosphere of the team / office / etc. is like, whether there are any social or charity events organised throughout the year (if that kind of stuff interests you, obviously), what a typical day in the job you're applying for might be like, and whether the role has any specific training / qualifications expected from you while you're there. Don't ask things for the sake of it though, they'll be able to tell, make sure they're things you actually give a shit about or want to know that you couldn't find out on the website. 
- Remember that they already think you can do the job. That's why you have the interview. They're looking to see if you'll fit as a person. Know your CV and job history inside out, be prepared for questions that aren't just interview questions, and try to get a dialogue going if you can. 
- Don't be afraid to think before you speak. It shows you're actually considering your answer and not just giving rehearsed lines. 
- Have some situations in your head that can be adapted to a lot of common questions. Think of an event, either in a job or even in your personal life, depending on your age or experience, where you handled a crisis well. Don't be afraid to paint yourself in a good light. 
- Dress smart, smile and make eye contact. Give them real answers. Be genuine.

This...

&gt;Certificates of Sponsorship can usually only be issued to international football players of the “highest calibre”

And this...

&gt;...current rules define a player as automatically being of the highest calibre provided:

&gt;(1) they have played for their country in at least 75% of its competitive A team matches in the two years preceding the application; and

&gt;(2) the player’s country must be at or above 70th place in the official FIFA world rankings.

And finally this...

&gt;Where players do not qualify under the above criteria which presume he is of the “highest calibre” it is still possible to seek a work permit premised on the player having exceptional ability and potential to contribute to English football.

Because every Belgian football fan saw KDB and Lukaku play in our own league we all know what they're capable of. Yet I noticed Lukaku has put a lot more thought in to his game since his time at Anderlecht. He used to hang back at the centre and just ask the ball deep and rush to goal and crush any defender standing in his way. (Impressive to see a 16 yr old do this, though.) Now he's gotten better at playing football and constructing an attack. Still needs improving, but he'll get there when Mourinho gives him the chance. 
KDB is just pure class. The guy can see things on the pitch people watching it on TV can't even see. He has manifested himself as THE MAN in our national team, which when considering the competition, is quite spectacular. 
Hazard still needs to be able to be in a match more in my opinion, but his talent is basically unquestionable. Would love to see our 3 guys in the PL.

Sitting on top of a a megalithic financial services sector is tremendously advantageous for us - not least because the whole western world conducts its buissness using the model we established in the 1800s. Regulation should be to make it safe - over-regulating it though is a big risk, because it will just stiffle one of our only remaining sucessfull buisnesses.

We all talk about being a manufacturing powerhouse, but it just isn't going to happen overnight. Our national industry is financial services, whether people like that or not.

distribution. Invariably the hottest sun and the windiest winds always are far from population centers, ergo you will always need long transmission lines to carry the energy from there to where it is needed, inducing a 10% inherent energy loss in the process. 

Furthermore if you take into account the scale at which solar arrays or wind farms would have to operate you realise how infeasible it really is. 

To produce 1GW of power requires 50sq miles of desert to be bulldozed for solar power or 100sq miles and 1000 windmills for wind power or 350,000,000 tons of coal or 200 tons of Uranium or 1 ton of Thorium in a [LFTR](

One of the most important features of a LFTR is that it does NOT require to be built close to bodies of water (unlike conventional Nuclear power stations which require water for cooling) as such and because there is no risk of explosion , contamination or heavy transuranics (Pu, Np and Cm) can be built much closer to areas of population thus reducing the losses incurred through long transmission lines.

What's worse, missing out on Suarez? Or paying him £100k a week to sit on the bench. I think the latter. 

&gt;You may understand how to sell big name players but haven't a clue when it comes to buying them.

Apparently neither do LFC. This is the club that spent £75M on Carroll, Downing, Henderson, and Adams. In fact, from 2003-present, LFC have spent £100M more than United (£465M to £382M) only to finish over 20 points away. 

FSG's investment into LFC dwarfs how much Arsenal have spent in the past 5 years, and the only return is finishing 12 points below Arsenal. I'm sure Henry loves that. Great bang for buck.

There was also had a separate 'adult' classification which caught anything with colourful language which wasn't spam but was otherwise in breach of the customer's policies. Going through anything in that section was far worse than the regular stuff, as it was typically people using their work emails to email their mates about their outrageous weekends, etc.

I spent my spare time developing a new version of the product which eventually replaced it and was an order of magnitude better. I managed to sell this to my bosses because it was based on open source software, and the old version was something we were licensing and reselling, and quite expensive. For them it was just a bonus that it barely required any human supervision, and allowed end users to retrieve emails blocked due to the adult rules if they gave a code to their line managers. We didn't have to wade through a bunch of typically pretty personal stuff to decide if it was ok for someone to say 'f**k' in a work email.

I'm not going to sit by and watch smaller clubs talk about Arsenal's misfortune. 

Arsenal is on the up again after maintaining CL and signing massively improved commercial revenue deals. LFC is firmly midtable. Celebrating 4th sucks, but I'd rather be doing that than celebrating the EL. But oh wait, LFC don't have that to celebrate either.

&gt; it's a shame joke to see you consistently flirt with success, yet get shot down year after year.

Flirting is better than purchasing overpriced players only to fail *miserably*. Like I said, if you thought 12 points was a big gap, wait till Suarez and Agger leave. 

John Henry wishes LFC could flirt with success, unfortunately, LFC is the fat nerdy kid at the school dance and flirting is the last thing on his mind. 

&gt;And if it has come to gloating about consistently finishing in champions league, then you realise how far Arsenal has fallen.

Maybe so, but even a weakened Arsenal is still enough to tempt LFC's star player. Suarez is intelligent enough to see LFC for what it is, a midtable club competing with WBA and Swans.

We've had all bloody summer to buy players that would get us top 4. and yet, none have come in. i'm pretty convinced that these owners are going to be gone next summer. i think getting CL has become much harder than they expected and are looking to make Liverpool as attractive as possible for future buyers.

Do I wish people didn't kill each other at all? Absolutely I do. However,  Saddam was murdering plenty of people on a daily basis, and when he eventually died or became weak, the situation would have worsened rapidly.  Innocent Iraqi people were going to die whatever anyone did; at least this way, they got a real regime change and a chance at democracy.  

But Galloway doesn't want you to think nasty things about his mate Saddam.  Just like he doesn't want you to be rude about his mate Ahmadinejad.

What a fucking reject. You think the US invaded to take canada. You know nothing about the war of 1812. We wanted the valuable territory west of the mississippi, not a worthless shithole like canada. We wanted to break british ties with the indians west of the mississippi in order to start expanding there. The brits wanted to prevent the US from expanding north and competing with british claims to the pacific northwest. America got the lands west of the mississippi. Britain failed. 

There were other minor made up reasons for the war, but the core aspect of it was america desire to expand west and brits desire to prevent it.

The only retards that think that US wanted canada are idiotic canadians. Canadian tundra doesn't compare to the arable, accessible western US.

A great example in the first link; one poster says *""I think it would be great seeing Scotland as part of Scandinavia""*... but anyone thats ever set foot in scandinavia will probably know that there isn't any serious appetite for a scandinavian union, they aren't a contiguous block like people make out... nor have they ever been.

I don't understand this statement.  Saddam wasn't leaving the world alone, he had plenty of ambitions to become a bigger player in the region.  

If however, you're suggesting it's moral to abandon Iraqis to torture and death at the hands of a lunatic, simply because I can't directly see or feel the effects from rural England; I'm afraid I completely repudiate that view as utterly immoral.

Sure, a 6GB game now takes 20 minutes or so longer to download, but that's ok, I'm not downloading a new game every day (or every week for that matter).  

To be honest I think that unless you're downloading huge amounts of data that you can't wait for, most people would be more than happy with 20Mb/s and anything beyond that is just overkill.

&gt;One final, crucial advantage of a Scandinavian over a British Scotland: it would no longer be in the Far North of the UK, but in the Southwest of the Scandinavia. The place would not have to move an inch, but it would sound less cold, dark and at the end of everything

The second link has two comments. Both of which are skeptical. The article it refers to no longer exists. 

The third article is a user submitted critique of a speech by David Camaron and does not mention Scandinavian.

It's in every single newspaper, on the tv, on the internet.  We have ""Protect the children"" being used as an excuse to bring in web censorship.  A child goes missing or is murdered and the papers jump on the ""it must be a pedo"" bandwagon.    We have MPs tweeting names of alleged child molesters and then being sued for libel because the person they are accusing can prove he wasn't even in the country.  That, to me, is a frenzy.  If you can't see it, then what can I say?

&gt;I think it very unlikely the police are arresting anyone on the back of one person coming forward and accusing someone.

I think it very likely that it is.  The police have possibly let a potential paedophile ring grow under their noses/ignored the signs of one developing.   They were heavily criticised by the Leveson Enquiry and they have a lot to prove to get back into the good graces of the public.

&gt; What's your opinion on all this when you get two, three or four unconnected people coming forward and accusing the same person and giving similar details?

I said most of this nonsense.  If there are other witnesses/victims and their stories tally (like Stuart Hall) then there should be a trial.

&gt;By the by, do you not find it incredibly strange that so few women ever say something like you just did?

In my mind that's the reason why every time the Doctor has met a renegade (The Master, The Rani, The Meddling Monk, The Valeyard) they've never had names, rather titles relevant to the lives they've chosen upon leaving Gallifrey, and that certainly seems to fit with the direction Moff's been taking with the Doctor's name and all that fun stuff.

&gt;because if you were standing infront of Saddam Hussein you'd probably say something nice on account of the dude's reputation.

Galloway shouldn't have given the scumbag 30 seconds of his time, or the publicity, so having to say something nice about him (things he continued to say out of Saddam's earshot and influence), should never have been an issue. 

&gt;George Galloway never armed Saddam like the British and American governments did. George Galloway never encouraged Saddam Hussein to attack Iran and didn't support Saddam's regime in any way.

Ah, the dirty hands argument.  Because we were wrong before, we should be paralysed with guilt, and never try to do the right thing ever again!  This argument makes no sense. 

&gt;George Galloway then went on not to murder hundreds of thousands of Iraqis.

Thankfully Galloway has never been in a position of any kind of power, so I imagine he'd find it difficult to even begin an endeavour like the one you propose.

&gt;So you think Galloway is Saddam's mate

Galloway thinks Galloway is Saddam's mate.  He also enjoys fraternising with Iranian theocrats and sucking up to Muslim fundamentalists in Britain.  He's an all round good egg.

&gt;poo poo Blair's culpability in crimes of war.

If there are war crimes that Blair is responsible for, let him be tried for them at The Hague. I think a million deaths, and using the term ""mass murderer"" is hyperbole yes; but my support of the war never came from Blair's reasoning anyway.  The point is, whatever the intentions, the Iraqi people have a chance to be better off now than they were before the intervention.

true,TomShoe,1972crest,,"I don't know that I'd consider Nasri a natural wide player, I'd say he's best played centrally, and allowed to roam about the final third as he pleases, more or less the same as Silva. In our title winning season we played more or less a 4-2-2-2 with Silva and Nasri or Milner just behind the strikers, swinging out to provide width as necessary. Pellegrini has used a similar formation in the past and is known to favor situational width like this. Mancini favored a more direct approach though, so width was never a top priority. The option was there for Silva and Nasri to play wide, but it was rarely utilized. The next season, last season, he switched it so that we generally played Tevez,or at times Aguero as a second striker/CAM alongside the other two attacking midfielders, transforming it into a 4-2-3-1, but because the CAMs so rarely ventured out wide the midfield became congested and was easy to stall by opponents who would just park the bus. It will be important for Pellegrini to take advantage of the flexibility of his attacking midfield line up to provide width when necessary, but I honestly have no idea what sort of formation he'll employ to do it. 

I see Jovetic as particularly well suited to this role. He's able to play both in the hole or out wide on the left, and at Fiorentina, from what I understand, he was generally played in one role or the other at a time, but under Pellegrini, I can see him transitioning between the two as needed during games. The trouble is, Silva plays a similar role, and they can't be on the pitch at the same time. I'd hate to see either one sit on the bench. Navas presents a similar problem. He's more of an out and out winger than any of the other options, and I don't see him having the flexibility to provide Pellegrini with the situational width I expect him to employ, even though he's got more than enough skill. I've heard speculation that Pellegrini might have him cut inside more, but that's pretty unsubstantiated so far.

This team has more talent in attacking midfield than anywhere else on the pitch, and plenty of flexibility too, but I can see it being difficult to employ. I honestly have no idea how we'll employ it, but I'm very excited to see. Whatever formation we end up playing, I'd bet that the attacking midfield players are integral to it.

MPs - yes, it should be MP.  I agree.  But calling Sally Bercow a fuckwit is completely out of order.  

&gt;So far as I recall, the original Savile accusers didn't sell their stories?

I never mentioned Savile.  Him being dead means that he's not got a chance to ever defend himself against the accusations.   I believe in innocent before proven guilty.  We can't ever prove that he did the things he's accused of.   We've basically found a corpse guilty through the court of public opinion.  It all sounds like something the Inquisition would be proud of.

&gt;With regard to all the accusations, all the arrests and charging, my own reaction is to sit, wait and see what happens in court.

Same here.  However, I think the CPS should ensure that they only take these issues to court if they serve the public good and there is sufficient evidence to make a case.  Not, as it sometimes feels, because of media/public/political pressure.

In a 4-2-3-1 he becomes more of a utility player, playing wherever he's needed on a week by week basis, or just sitting on the bench.

His attitude and commitment is always 100%, but I'm not sure we'll see the best out of him until he has a regular role in the starting eleven.

On a local level or a national level? Locally though:

1) Plan out an end to segregated housing areas. All new housing areas to be mixed, all new social housing allocation to be included in new mixed areas only, all non mixed areas slowly depopulated and demolished, finally being rebuilt as new mixed developments. This would take 30 years or more, but it's the only way to bring an end to 'us vs. them' and certian sides trashing their own areas.

2) Restoration of academic selection, but also beef up vocational education. No child should be held back academically because some communist thinks it's more important to be equal. At the same time no child should be stopped from developing his full talents vocationally because some snob thinks only academic achievements have merit. Non-integrated schools are fine on the condition they link up with other schools for events, trips and projects. But the focus should be on new integrated education provision.

3) Overhaul of public transport. Translinks management thrown out and tenders put out to take over the franchise, with punctuality targets backed by penalties for non performance. Cycle network beefed up, something similar to the proposals here: http://nigreenways.wordpress.com/ . City/town centres made into pedestrian only zones (with the exception of cycle tracks), with busses/pickups only on the outer limits of the pedestrian zone. Plenty of bike parking in the area.

According to ITK (The Goat, it's reliable!), Lewis has given the greenlight to Levy throw down some more money and make a title run. I think I can see several more players coming in: Capoue: a CB, a LB, and a young striker. That would give us depth to challenge in the cups, the league, and the EL. That would give us a very good chance to run strong in the league. With changes at Chelsea, City, Utd, and little spending from Arsenal now is when we have to pounce. Villas Boas showed that he is a great manager and, with limited resources, almost managed to clinch a CL spot. 

Regardless of where we are, we need to aim for a title run, success in Europe, and success in the cups. If we're not aiming for those things, then why bother? If you aim for 4th, you'll be happy with fifth. Last season, many were expecting 7th and we took 5th. I'd rather we aim to win the whole thing, and settle with 3rd - 4th.

Straight from the sidebar! Ending the season in fourth place, and barring any shit like Arsenal winning the CL or something, 4th would not be a disappointment. 

However if we play out this season as if fourth is the best we can realistically attain, and never look like we could do any better than fourth, that would be a disappointment. At no point do I want to feel like we settled for fourth.

true,Spiritisabone,null,null,"Fair enough, there is a certain pragmatism in leveraging the financial sector to seriously reshape the economy (is that happening?), but I don't think your second sentence contravenes your first one. I agree that the UK enjoyed success from relatively unbridled financial services, at least in the short term, but that doesn't mean they weren't deeply implicated in the crisis, or that in aggregate the good to the UK counterbalances global harm done. Brits not being swindled as badly on the mortgage front is only a small part of the picture after all. I just can't agree that we're really at risk of over-regulating those parts of our financial services that actually help allocate resources efficiently. With current capacities, regulators have a very tough time keeping up with the inventiveness of the financial sector anyway.

So I'm not saying we need to strangle financial services to death, but that's certainly not what's happening at the moment. Focus needs to be on new industries, new services, new models of finance and not on pandering old financial interests, fearing their slightest inconvenience. The UK is wealthy and can afford to borrow still, many manufacturing success stories already exist, some stellar research is done here too. Finally, on the question of how advantageous it is to have a big finance sector, it's interesting to ponder what would all the immense talent lured by lucrative shadow finance be doing in the world were it not for the millions to be made shorting or shaving milliseconds off FX trades.

Can we not *debase* ourselves with this DM circlejerk again?

true,limitz,null,null,"&gt;Mmmm.... my point is, what big name players has wenger ever signed?

Wenger develops players, he doesn't sign them. Only recently has he changed his transfer policy (hence the £40M for Suarez).

&gt;Your manager has a history of wasting money when he spends big 

Arsenal's transfer record is Santi Cazorla at £15M, the same price as Joe Allen and less than Downing. Such a waste.

LFC is the definition of wasting money when spending big. Since 2003, LFC have spent more than United (by nearly £100M) only to finish over 20 points away.

&gt;and is making a fool of himself with Suarez.

Yet Liverpool will be stuck paying Suarez' salary while he disrespects the club and sits on the bench.

In the end, LFC will be the biggest fools as you're stuck with the bill *and* sitting midtable. 

&gt; I believe, although the question remains, why are you even here?

Because I don't like sitting idly by while fans of a small club talk bullshit. 

Also, because I feel like most LFC are deluded about the size of the club, when in fact, all signs point to LFC being a midtable team (lack of CL, lack of EL, having a 2-3-1 record against WBA/Everton/Swans).",0,1376347692,null,0,1376350415,0,cbmg5o8,t3_1k65fr,t1_cbmg5o8,t1_cbme5mu,null,1429851905,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

A night in York is a good idea, but personally I'd switch it round and spend a night in Newcastle rather than Durham. So on the way up I'd do day in Durham then 20 minutes further on the train to Newcastle (so you don't even need to book a ticket), for the afternoon/ evening / night in Newcastle, then day/night in york on the way back.

Newcastle has a good waterfront and city centre and a lot to see, particularly if you get the metro out to the coast. Durham is good but its got 2 boxes to tick (the castle and the cathedral) but at night it'll be a bit boring. Newcastle is *never* boring and probably looks better at night than in the daytime.

When you're booking the train make sure you get the fast one that takes ~3h (from KGX to NCL/DHM) and doesn't stop much but there is another that takes ~5h, and stops at every single station.  Buy your tickets [direct from eastcoast](http://www.eastcoast.co.uk) for web only fares that are really good value (Also no booking or CC fees)! When you arrive in to Newcastle from the south, make sure you're sitting on the RHS of the train for the good view down the river!

edit: York and Durham are tiny, no need for buses at all you can walk across the whole city centre in 30 minutes same goes for Newcastle (if you decide to go there) and Edinburgh .

true,Thetonn,eng-sussex,Sussex,"For a lot of reasons.

Firstly, basic schoolboy stuff, you need a pitch which is maintained through the year, you need equipment like bats, pads and the like. That is to get to the very first level.

After that's you need nets. You need indoor facilities (or else they forget everything in the 3/4 of the year they play other sports), you need proper and expensive coaches. This costs hundreds of thousands of pounds for around 40 odd youngsters.

After that, you need professional coaches, analysists and the like to work it the failings in technique and allow people to develop over years of playing.

Basically, you are spending millions of pounds to get a small number of world class players.

This either comes from private schools, which are exclusive and only focus on an exceptionally small minority of people, or from clubs which are already very poor, struggling and not taking a lot of money in because, again, very short summers and playing time we're dealing with here.

The point of Sky is that people who love cricket are paying a massive amount to the ECB who then give money to the clubs to develop players as well as invest in their own development program's.

So, while India and Pakistan and other places can just rely on sheer numbers and raw talent, we have to refine a very small talent field, for which we need money, for which we need sky.

- Dalek

Introduction to the Daleks

- Parting Of The Ways/Bad Wolf

Still my favourite of the new-Who finales, the sheer scale and an example of what The Daleks can REALLY do. Plus Eccleston's fantastic regeneration. 

- The Girl In The Fireplace 

This for me is the ultimate new-Who episode, consistent, beautifully written and everything Doctor Who, space, monsters under the bed and time travel. 

Rise Of The Cybermen/The Age Of Steel

No crash course would be complete without the introduction of the Cybermen, although I prefer the Gaiman episode in many ways the inclusion of the Children kills it for me. This also shows the origin of the Nu-Who cybers. 

- Army Of Ghosts/Doomsday

Shows the effect the companions loss can have on The Doctor in comparison to the previous season finale. Also, robots fighting robots. What's not to love? 

- Voyage Of The Damned

Despite being the ultimate cheesy episode (The Starship Titanic) I feel that more than Vincent, this episode captures the wonders that The Doctor can create for somebody down on their luck. 

- The Waters Of Mars

This is New-Who's darkest hour. It ends with a suicide. It's The Doctor at his boldest and he's more confident than we've ever seen him. Dangerously so and it doesn't pay off. A much better episode than A Good Man Goes To War with similar themes. 

- The End Of Time 

This does a great job of explaining just WHY the Time Lords had to be destroyed (+ Dalton) plus a heart breaking speech from Ten to Wilf, along with John Simm being a fantastic, if a bit crazy Master. 

- The Eleventh Hour

This is an episode that introduces a new Doctor, hell. It was a better introduction than Tennant's and has a wonderful flashback scene.

- The Doctor's Wife

This episode really explores The Doctor's relationship with the TARDIS, beautiful ending.

- Journey To The Center Of The TARDIS

Of all the new-Who episodes, this gives you the best impression of it's size, as well as it being a nice self contained action flick.

We can doubt the value of having Villa and Benteke in our squad, but I still wouldn't have turned either of them down.  It seems pretty clear to me that our interest in both of them was real, and yet other clubs pounced while we were dithering away.  I'm sure Levy was holding out for last day/week moves for both of them, assuming no one else would lock them down before then.  It was a bad assumption.

And the Moutinho and Damiao issues are even more embarrassing I think.  I mean, it's no secret that they had 3rd party ownership involved, and that was always going to complicate negotiations.  We needed a striker all through January... why did we wait until the last day to try and sign one?  We should've been lodging a bid for someone at 9am, January 1.

true,Batfan66,null,null,"I appreciate your enthusiasm, but your ""little bit of history behind them"" is totally inaccurate.

&gt; These are two original films made by the BBC that were released in theaters in the 1960's.

The BBC did not make these films and were not involved in any way. They were made by [Amicus Productions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amicus_Productions).

&gt;So why would the BBC make these films that completely ignore the Doctor's backstory from the show? Because while these films do have the Doctor as the protagonist, the Doctor isn't really the main focus of the story.

The movies do not deal with the Doctor's backstory, because they did not own the rights to it. The production company only had the rights to the original scripts by Terry Nation, which is why Dr. Who is a human with a new origin. 

&gt; During the 1960's Doctor Who was just another average BBC television series. It had it's fans, but it wasn't extremely popular. Then in 1963 the episode ""The Daleks"" aired.

You do realize that the Daleks first appear in the 5th episode, right? The show was barely on for a month when they showed up. 

&gt; The Daleks were everywhere. Merchandising, of course, brought in huge profits for the BBC. Their booming popularity inspired the BBC to create these two films starring Peter Cushing.

The BBC did not make any money from Dalek merchandise. The way British copyright law worked at the time gave Terry Nation total ownership of the Daleks. This is also why he was able to sell his scripts to Amicus Productions without any involvement of the BBC. To this day, if a Dalek appears on the show, a deal has to be made with Nation's estate.

true,swertsta,null,null,"I think we all have to calm down a bit here. It's pre-season it's more about taking the positives out of each game. 

For Torres he still needs to work on his back to goal, his strength is improving as noted with his goal vs benfica however is he strong enough maybe not. In nearly every game I watch Torres play he will generally sprint back and make 5 - 10 challenges on a defender or midfielder playing the ball out, I enjoy and like this part of his game. I would also say that Torres when he doesn't have a defender breathing down his neck has decent link up play. Torres seems to be able to present himself to receive the ball on more occasions than the other strikers but do you want him collecting the ball at half way or a 1/3rd the way up the pitch? personal opinion.

Demba Ba clearly has aerial prowess over the other strikers. Probably lacks pace compared to the others. Is definitely very intelligent with his runs given his pace. Better with his back to goal than Torres and probably marginally better than Lukaku haven't seen Lukaku in the premier league much to judge. Ba is probably less suited to play on the counter than the others due to lack of pace but perhaps could be used to retain possession. 

Lukaku is still raw. He has pace, power, strength. He is probably going to fuck up here and there but so does Torres and Ba. He has all the ingredients to be a world class striker its just about honing his technique and getting experience. A lot of people want Lukaku to start but for purely tactical reasons bringing him on as a sub against weary defenders would be better than bringing on Ba as a sub. If Torres still has decent pace which I still don't know about he is also a good sub option late in the game vs weary defenders. We also don't know about Lukakus ability to play out a long grueling season like Torres did to mediocre effect last year and Ba for a half a season did.

If busses are to be restricted, they should be allowed to an area towards the centre of the centre, rather than the outside to make it as easy as possible for people to get in and out.

Now whenever I want to go home, I just get my mum to come up and I'll pay her diesel for the journey. I'll get there much faster too, just over an hour in the car versus over 1 hour 45 on the bus. Of course it's much more flexible on times too. Busses were a nightmare when I was at school. Due to the bus from Newcastle to Downpatrick being frequently late, we'd often miss our normal connection, and sometimes the last bus to Strangford in the evening. Whenever complaints were made, in person, in writing, and by the school, Translink would just shrug and effectively say ""Eh, we're not going to do anything about it"". The school thing was about 8 years ago though. The last bus to Strangford is still at a stupidly early time, especially for anyone working a 9-5 further afield than Downpatrick!

I like taking the Enterprise as I like taking trains, plus the extra comfort afforded by the larger leg room and such is much nicer than the bus. But it is far too expensive and not run often enough to be actually useful. Really it should be half the cost, and at the very least run hourly.

a)  They're selling Bale to cover it.
b)  The owners/group as a collective are going to cover it through some mechanism (no interest loan or whatever).
c)  They're counting on making CL next year to help make the loss up in the following year.

B seems unlikely as they've never acted that way before, but it is possible.  C seems rather more ambitious (and risky) then I think would be wise to be.  Which leads me to believe they're planning on A.

Every Saturday until 17th August there is free live music at the Bandstand (outdoors) next to the castle between about 1200 - 1600.

There are a couple of really nice cafes worth visiting in Southsea: Tenth Hole Tea Rooms near the cricket pitch (I think they have a Facebook page) or the Garage Lounge on Albert Road.

* Skiving off for 40 minutes when you should be working.
* Risk of misuse of the firearm.
* Disrepute of the police.

I don't think that the firearm was at serious risk of misuse or misfiring, so that's why I don't think he needs to be sacked. I think if he'd taken the gun off to use a public lavatory and forgotten it, that would be more careless and risky. I see there are firearm risks to what he did though, so if you were to say throw him out of armed response then I'd accept that.

So skiving off for 40 minutes and disrepute of the police, I just can't justify a sacking for that.

I'd rather we sacked police officers who actually lied about evidence or victimised innocent people (which happens all the time, without hardly anyone noticing) than cops who are just lazy or led around by their dicks. 

From my negative experiences of cops - lying on separate occasions over 20 years - I'd rather give this cop a second chance.

true,zeezeee,null,null,"In regards to Ba, he didn't have a great 6 months but at the very least his movement remained useful to the team as a whole and he continued to make space for both himself (admitedly he seems to have developed the habit of falling over before the shot) or for others. I don't think he got better service at Newcastle though. Teams approach Newcastle very very differently to how they approach playing against Chelsea. You'll probably notice a difference this year for Lukaku as well since he most likely wont have as much space to run into as he did last season. 

In regards to Torres what infuriates me the most about him, has been the fact that at times he makes things worse by being on the pitch. You can highlight his goal against Everton all you want but just remember that is what you are doing, highlighting. You've highlighted a moment in the league when he scored a decent goal. There've been many more moments than I care to remember, where he refused to take similar opportunities to that goal (coincidently his first league goal - in May - since December). Admitedly he was used more in Europa then he was in the prem. But you're praising the painfully average and looking for anything to hold up and cherish. You say if he carries on his 'form' from the tail end of last season it gives Jose a very good problem. Believe me I wish he had it in his locker to play the way you're seemingly choosing to see him but quite frankly he's a flop that we are stuck with. He's on high wages with plenty of time left on his deal - so impossible to move on. The only solace we can take is that he's still marketable as shown by the unwavering support he gets from fans.

You might think that I am refusing to give Torres credit where it is due but I'm just calling it as I see it. I mean whoop-ti-do he scored in the Europa league final, the same goes for Iva it is really not something worth celebrating in hindsight. It's an embarrassment to have been in the competition in the first place (remember Hazard playing the false-9 because our beloved Robbie wanted anything but Torres to play upfront in Turin?). I've lost all coherence, forgive me it's now almost 7am in London and I'm yet to sleep. I'm going to stop here. But to just reiterate, I hold no stock in Torres' failures, if he could become a 20 goal a season striker in fewer games I'd be delighted.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"But that doesn't really address the question - we understand you don't like the system of constitutional monarchy, for the record neither do I, but why the personal antagonism towards _this particular_ set of royalty.  Is it purely about what they represent?  In which case it's probably better to keep it impersonal. Is it about specific things they've done, in which case better to state the specifics and which particular royal did it.  Does it reflect some of the alleged murkier and more disturbing details of royal life which surface from time to time on the peripheries of the media but rarely get wider play? Is it about events of some years ago, when there was a lot of bad press around the monarchy - e.g. Camilla-gate, the treatment of Diana, etc.  Is it a general contempt for those with wealth and power?  Etc.

I mean, personally, I'm not sure about them as I don't personally know and have not met any of them, and you mostly hear carefully stage-managed and spun stories, which rarely give any genuine depth.  There's news which leaks at the edges, some of which _is_ pretty horrific and worrisome, but much of it comes from very unreliable sources.  Then there are some pretty clear indications of the individual personalities of some of our royals - and these seem pretty variable.  But even though I'm personally convinced that I'd find most of them deeply unpleasant people with borderline fascist (certainly deeply and offensively conservative) worldviews, I also view them as monsters of our own creation and creatures of the circumstances under which they are forced to live their lives.  Their cage is very pleasant, and they are pampered pets, but they live their lives in captivity nonetheless.

You don't need to disclose spent convictions when applying for most jobs. Under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 it's unlawful for an employer to discriminate on the grounds of a spent conviction. However, some types of jobs are exempt from this Act – this means you have to disclose spent convictions as well as unspent ones. These jobs include:

We joined late, but we did end up fighting across Africa, Europe and Asia and losing hundreds of thousands of men along the way. We produced weapons and supplies at a rate that no country on either side could hope to match. We defeated Japan's navy in the Pacific and made it possible to establish a second front in Europe.

Churchill knew how important it was to bring the US into the war. On the night Pearl Harbor was attacked he said that he ""went to bed and slept the sleep of the saved and thankful.""

But nobody can deny I am very specifically, and very accurately, cosplaying Cheryl. Just not standard canon Cheryl. 

My guess is that this cosplayer especially liked that particular episode or outfit for whatever reason, and chose to do that costume specifically. Doesn't make the cosplay less valid (although honestly, personally, ""real person"" cosplay only impresses me when the person looks remarkably like the actual actor they're representing, as in [this Tom Baker cosplay](http://www.flickr.com/photos/graysunrise/7959652458/) - the cosplayer linked in the OP doesn't particularly look like Matt Smith, therefore it doesn't seem like a particularly spot-on costume choice...although I will give him that he did reproduce the Let's Kill Hitler outfit fairly accurately, so props for effort).

There is a huge gap between what EDF are proposing and what would be tolerable for nuclear. It won't happen in a million years if EDF continue to hold out for that price. It would be cheaper to frack and bottle the bloody CO2 up.

It is worth noting that renewables are getting cheaper faster than nuclear is (in fact nuclear seems to get more expensive every year).

&gt;least comfortable trains in Europe.

again entirely subjective, but my own anecdotal evidence proves this incorrect - i've had less comfortable trains in both Spain and Germany

I would get up at about 8.30 to get to school for 9am, my mum would drop me in on her way to work. Coffee for breakfast every day, sometimes a bit of toast as well but I would skip it some days.

School was 9am-3.30, lunch break at half 12, you'd get 45 minutes for it. For lunch I'd have a sandwich I made myself, an apple and something else, a yogurt or rice snack or some crisps and normally another coffee.

After school I would walk home with my brother, get in for about 4pm, have more coffee right away and some toast or a cake or something, watch TV for an hour or so, start homework at 5-6ish.

* Insurance. You need to have insurance documents unless you opt to work through an Umbrella company (charges apply).
* Accountacy - Unless you are good with the books, you may need someone to help you with your banking, paying tax and national insurance.
* 0 benefits - if you have a pension or health care, you will need to start paying for this.


On top of that, you usually get no more than 1 weeks notice. I can't tell you how busy your job market is, I have no idea what you do. But they are some bits to think about.

The two women mainly seem to be annoyed that they had to sit on the floor while there were plenty of spare seat in the next carriage. I can understand that, when I used to commute I sometimes found myself in very cramped conditions, while I could see one fucker in first class with the entire carriage to himself.

The ironic thing is, although he has paid a bit extra to be in first class, he hasn't paid anything like the true cost of running an extra carriage just for him. Those of us crammed in like cattle are actually subsidising him!

But that is the way it is at the moment, those women and their group of kids had no right to sit in first class.

I really don't know who was being let into first class. Normally this just isn't allowed (because it would cause a riot), unless things get really bad and they declassify the whole train, then anyone can sit/stand anywhere.

I would imagine someone was trying to be helpful by moving a few people into first class to free up space so that at least people *could* sit on the floor. They aren't really allowed to, someone in first class could complain and get them in trouble, so when two women and a dozen young kids want to go in there, they are going to say no.

Seriously, it's very unlikely that they are actively pursuing a weapons program. Maybe back in the early 2000s (in fact, almost certainly), but not now. We'd be the first to know if they were - they'd have to break seals on facilities, kick inspectors out and leave the NPT and so on.

Now, they may be at the point where they can have a ""break out"" program and develop a bomb in a very short amount of time, but then any country with a sizable civilian nuclear program could do, too (e.g. Japan). Again, given the amount of scrutiny they're under, we'd know about it before they actually did it.

Not saying the current Iranian regime is all sweetness and light, mind you -  they’re a bunch of corrupt fucksticks who are systematically destroying a beautiful country and people.

Now i have believed that JD would be a good player to hold onto as a impact sub at a bare minimum but i saw someone on another board last week mention that statistically (poster claimed he had a record of something like 100+ appearances with 10 goals) he is crap as a sub, i can see his numbers last season as a sub (8 appearances, 1 goal, 0 assists) but i can't see where i can find his career numbers as a sub. Yet i have not been able to verify that anywhere,

End tangent

I really have no issue keeping JD, he can be wildly frustrating at times to watch but he has always scored for us and i think could fit a good role for us as a backup striker.

2 adults for that many children with disabilities simply isn't fair on the children or on the adults. Even if they were some of the most perfectly behaved children, if one required the bathroom they would need to be taken thusly leaving 9 children being supervised by a single adult.

Make up your mind, are you complaining about refunds OR seating arrangements? Because your original reply was that it was entitled to ask for a refund for no first class level service being given when a first class ticket was purchased.    

&gt; just because you are too precious to tolerate a small disturbance to your journey, then yes - you are a self-absorbed, entitled cunt.    

So just to be clear: Paying more for a quiet more comfortable cabin and then expecting that service makes you a ""self-absorbed entitled cunt."" But refusing to take a later train and then demanding that you get a seat on the busy one isn't entitled at all, right?    

Look, I think that train operators need to do better at making sure enough seats are made available, but realistically it is no more or less entitled for a standard class passenger to demand a seat as it is for a first class passenger to demand what they paid for (a seat in a quiet more comfortable cabin).

Mrs Sharon Hodgson (Washington and Sunderland West) (Lab):

&gt;By the end of this financial year, East Coast estimates that it will have returned about £800 million to the Exchequer since the line was nationalised. The net public subsidy in the past financial year was just 1% of turnover, compared with an industry average of 32%.

&gt;A recent report commissioned by the TUC reveals that **the firms receiving the largest state subsidies spend more than 90% of their profits on average on shareholder dividends**. Of those firms, the top five recipients received almost £3 billion in taxpayer support between 2007 and 2011, which allowed them to make operating profits of £504 million. However, more than 90% of that money—£466 million—was paid straight to shareholders.

That bolded bit just shouts ""fraud"" to me.

The long term plan for Chelsea involved acquiring the best young talents for the squad, filling the academy with the best prospects and lower the average age and wage at the same time. This required a lot of time but now seems to have been completed, we've never had a stronger youth setup. The final piece of the puzzle was a manager who could grow these young players and help them fulfil their potential, while winning enough games that the younger players get a chance in the first team, we're all hoping this second spell of JoMo is that missing piece

We have some great players coming back from loan; Kevin De Bruyne and Lukaku foremost among them and both have impressed in the pre-Season. Marco Van Ginkel was arguably the man who impressed the most during the Summer and there are high hopes for him. We also have a returning Essien, new boy Schuerrle to bolster a squad that looked depleted and worn out for most of last season. If anybody can rotate players and manage a larger squad, it is JoMo

Formation is a tough call, we are yet to see if another player is coming in which may affect our first choice XI. The common consensus is of alternating between 4-3-3 and 4-2-3-1, though a formation employing two strikers cannot be ruled out either in certain situations. While we appear to have a lot of players who want to play the same position, there are ways of fitting them in. You'd expect the central position behind the striker to be occupied by KDB or Oscar, Mata and Moses on the right, Hazard and Schuerrle on the left. JoMo used to talk passionately about his 22-man squad preference, two players for every position. We've lacked proper competition for places for a while and the reinforcements seem to have come at exactly the right time

If they turn out to be really noisy, then of course, it is within the rights of the other first class passengers to complain. Insensitive maybe, but they paid for quiet and comfort, and the train company is responsible for delivering that.

I expect that within the T&amp;Cs there is a clause about not causing disruption to other passengers in first class. If anyone fails to abide by these T&amp;Cs, then the train company is well within their rights to remove them from the carriage.

In this case, the kids don't have first class tickets, so I don't think they should be allowed into first class regardless of how disabled they are.

They moved some people from standard to business because of the disparity in how busy the two sections were, that much is made clear in the article. However, they still have somewhat of an obligation to those who paid full fare to be there to get the best experience possible, and 10 children to two supervisors is unlikely to allow that. It's called *business* class because many people pay the extra to allow them the quietness to get some work done. Remember, many of these people may be doing this journey every working day and as such consider it a part of their work day.

The whole thing is seemingly written in the wrong order to increase outrage.

&gt;But she moved other kids and parents, who had paid the same train fare, into those seats.

&gt;After complaining time and again, Stage Right leaders say the train manager still refused to let the children sit in business class.

&gt;But workers from the charity say they were told by a train manager that the kids, including a boy who only has one leg, couldn’t sit in business class as the people in that carriage “do not need the likes of your children spoiling their journey”.

A bit mean still, but it seems far more plausible, doesn't it? People were getting invited to move into business class, but as management didn't want to let things get too out of hand in there they selectively picked people who wouldn't disturb the atmosphere in there. The supervisors of the kids started getting annoyed/jealous/whatever and kept going on about it, until someone bluntly explained why they weren't picked.

It's exactly the same on aeroplanes, where being well dressed and good-mannered will improve your chances of being upgraded because you're much less likely to spoil the conditions for those who paid for it.

So yes, it's a tiny bit mean, but under no circumstances should people who pay for standard fares feel that they are entitled to upgrades. I'm more surprised that nobody gave up their seat in standard for a kid with one leg. I'd go as far as to say that it's quite possible that someone did, and the article decided to omit it, but that's purely speculation.

Additionally most americans seem to think the British empire and the modern day small UK are the same, they are not. When the US declared independence the British Empire was still to achieve it's peak, it was still the dominant force in the world until the early 20th century. Politically, militarily and economically no other nation held a candle to it except France and even then only briefly and not as bright.

France is of course not the only reason the British didn't win the war there was no political will for it as the US was, at that time, far more costly to keep going than it was generating. So economically it made no sense especially while still at war with France.

Culturally the first language of the US could have been just as easily German or French as many many German and French speaking peoples emigrated and that is still visible today. Could have just as easily been a monarchy or been Catholic. Ultimately the reason the cultural similarities exist is because the majority of the people who helped shape the US were British.

This ""major loss"" of the east cost of the US by the British is barely a blip in British history, Canada was a proverbial goldmine of resources and trade as were the colonies in the Caribbean and of course later on India, China (HK), Australia etc etc. I can see why Americans like to think of it as a conflict of epic proportions leading to freedom through fire and blood but it just wasn't the case at all. Britain likely wouldn't have fought terribly hard for it at any stage as it wasn't great for them economically and of course cost a small fortune to defend from the French and Spanish. Naval superiority and trade with the East were vastly more important, it's a nice myth but it's just not based in reality, but as I said I can see why it's clung on to.

So if you want a flat share with hopefully someone normal, I would recommend getting an add up on [Spare Room](http://www.spareroom.co.uk/), you can post an add for a 'Room wanted' or for a 'Buddy up'. I have had very good experiences with this site. 

Like everyone else has mentioned stay away from Grant Property Management, but also as most people have mentioned, pretty much all letting agents are a bunch a money grabbing dicks. So really the best way is to cover your back at all times. D.J Alexender are very professional and probably my favorite. 

[City Lets](http://www.citylets.co.uk/flats-rent-edinburgh/) is a brilliant website to find loads of flats from various letting agents, but do not use the number they provide to contact the agents, this is a premium rate number (or at least one that charges loads), find the flats you like then just quickly and easily do a search for the letting agents and give them a call on their actual number.

[Gumtree](http://www.gumtree.com/edinburgh) as mentioned is great too, but I would be rather cautious as anyone can post here, you can use this for either flats to rent or rooms in an existing flat.

The area is completely up to yourself, Stockbridge is over priced, but the area is lovely. Broughton/ Cannonmils / Bellview is a great area at very reasonable prices.
The top of Leith - McDonald Road/ Hillside Areas are great.
Over towards the Meadows can be very studenty the same as Bruntsfield, but this isn't to say they are not nice.

Council Tax is a motherfucker, don't know where you are moving from and if you have already experienced this but please do not forget to take this into consideration when looking at prices, it is broken into bands and you will find the pricing [Here](http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/info/607/council_tax-banding/518/council_tax_banding_and_charges), these charges are for 12 months.

Lastly energy rating and single or double glazing, Edinburgh is cold and windy, I would say that double glazing is a 100% a must have, especially for winter. An EPC is a Energy Performance Certificate and by law every flat or house must have one. This Certificate will calculate the Energy Efficiency of your property, and will be graded by scale from Grade A (being the most efficient) to Grade G (being the least efficient.

I hope this is in someway helpful.

&gt; - The overall objective of this study was to examine whether rents changed in response to an exemption from National Non Domestic Rates (NNDR, also known as business rates). The method adopted was to use Enterprise Zones (EZs), where no business rates were payable while the zone was in force, as a control group against which to assess properties with similar characteristics but receiving no relief from business rates. The nature of the relationship between rents and NNDR was investigated using the change in EZ-related NNDR status as the trigger point for altering the negotiation stance between landlord and tenant.
&gt;
&gt; - The main conclusion is that 100% of the benefits from NNDR relief are passed into rents and therefore accrue to landlords, although the range of uncertainty surrounding this statistical estimate1 puts the boundary at somewhere between 65% and 150%.

Regardless of the criticisms laid out here in this thread on the BBC I still think it is overall a force for good. The BBC contributes to the economy two pounds for every one pound spent, and the quality of science and entertainment programming is mostly excellent. Take one look at the US to see the consequences of a country which doesn't have a big public service broadcaster that serves the people and not shareholders. If the BBC is reduced to more like PBS in America then expect the intellect of programming across all media to drop significantly.

The massive influence that Rupert Murdoch has over the market is still extremely worrying, though. The fact that it owns The Sun, The Times and a massive stake in Sky (which in turn owns a stake in ITV) is terrible for media plurality.

You and npfii first.   And in all this time I've not actually seen either of you remove your anonymity.   Which IS BLATANTLY what npfii was ultimately calling for no matter how thinly veiled the call was.   Simply because you'd have no way of knowing if that person was following the principals they were calling for others to follow without knowing who they really were. 

So yes I am perfectly correct in telling npfii to drop their shield of anonymity that a moniker grants them because if that person wants to make sure the DM readers are all above board why shouldn't we be afforded the exact same luxury with regards to npfii?  I can't think of a good reason and neither have you or you'd of stated it by now rather than nebulous ""you don't understand"" remarks.

QED.  It was an attack on people being 'somewhat' anonymous with a side order of ""one rule for me and one for you"" and treated as such.  The simple fact that npfii never did reveal their real identity either publicly or privately (as was offered) is further proof of that.  Thus: chain of fools.

The reason cited *by the aggrieved person* was because they were disabled. What the article does communicate, although *very* unclearly, is that one or both of the supervisors of the kids had been harassing the train staff over it, and I'd hazard a guess that the blunt comments came after repeated and unceasing pestering. For all we know, the quote isn't the same as what was actually said.

Also, for all we know, by 'the likes of your children', the member of staff may well have been trying to communicate that he didn't want to let through a large group of children with one supervisor per 5 kids. 'The likes of your children' is **not** the same as saying 'children like yours'. It's also I think quite possible that he said 'the likes of you', but she's added a bit to make it fit the narrative better.

Other people were allowed in because they probably seemed like they would cause minimum fuss. This group featured a large group of 10 children with only two supervisors, at least one of which is clearly argumentative.

true,Swooshington,1953,,"&gt;The current situation:

The current situation at Chelsea is good. The future looks bright, and if we can find some stability under Jose we could really see the team push onto another level. The huge improvements in the youth team under Roman are finally starting to produce quality players. People often criticise Chelsea for their reluctance and negligence towards the youth team, but in the last decade the had gone from producing Jody Morris' and Carlton Cole's to producing players like Reuben Loftus-Cheek and Nathanial Chalobah. Furthermore, thanks to Emenalo and the scouting team not only are we signing some of the best young talent out there (Courtois, Oscar, Hazard etc) we are signing some of the best youth prospects out there. And with the improved quality of the youth facilities the club are able to develop these players to a higher standard then ever before. The likes of Charly Musonda Jnr and Jeremie Boga spring to mind. The overall running of the club seems to have improved too. Signings are now (for the most part) better thought out, and whilst Roman has a reputation in the media for throwing his toys out of the pram, every decision he has made has benefited the club in the long run. It's also important to point out whilst the first team staff has changed fairly regularly, the remainder of the backroom staff and the youth team has remained fairly consistent which means there is more stability at the club then most people realise. The squad has great depth, and whilst it would benefit from another player or two, I feel it's in pretty good shape as it is.

&gt;Which players they like:

Who to choose! Mata is a firm favourite by most at the club. A sincere and lovely bloke, both intelligent on and off the pitch. The closest thing to Zola we may ever get. And that's a big compliment round here. We love Hazard, Oscar and Moses because they are exciting to watch and work hard. Truth is, there really isn't a universally unliked player in the squad anymore;
 
&gt; Players to watch:

This needs to be broken into two categories really. I think Hazard and Oscar will really come into their own this season, and start tearing teams apart on a regular basis. They were great last year, but expect another level this season. Lukaku and KdB will have strong season's and establish themselves as excellent squad players. And David Luiz will prove to be the formidable defender we know he is and prove the idiots who claim he should be a midfielder wrong. However, I personally think the breakout star will be Tomas Kalas. A huge amount of natural talent, and fairly low expectations will see his stock rise massively this campaign. He will show he is a solid option at right back, and cement himself as a future starter with some very solid performances this year, and I think he will quickly become regarded as one of the top young defenders in the league.

&gt;What formation the team may play:

You will see Jose rotate between a rigid 4-3-3 and a more fluid 4-5-1. On the face of it the formations are very similar, it is just the role of the '#10' that changes. In the 4-3-3 he will play a deeper role, more focus on team play and defence with the wingers expected to stay wide. Expect to see de Bruyne or Oscar fill this role. In the 4-5-1 you will see two deep midfielders, who will hold, defend and break up play, most likely Essien and Mikel. The number 10 will have more freedom and play off the front man. This screams Mata. So it will depend on opposition and score, but if Jose continues with HazMataCar expect to see him rotate in games, with Mata drifting wide and Oscar dropping slightly.",0,1376403020,null,0,false,0,cbmtvt6,t3_1k9ro9,t1_cbmtvt6,t3_1k9ro9,null,1429845340,9,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,9

true,Artoo_Detoo,RC,china,"I remember, that was a magical day for me, one of the best matches I have ever seen.  The rollercoaster of emotions was crazy.

First all the hype about how Barcelona were one of the best in the world, up 2-1 on aggregate, Eto'o talking trash about how Barcelona only needed 1 goal to seal the deal.

Then Kezman with an incredible cross to Gudjohnsen within 10 minutes, 1-0 Chelsea, they take the lead on away goals.  Couple of minutes later, Joe Cole with a great run to force Valdes into a save, typical Barcelona defense just stands there watching while Lampard punches the rebound in, Chelsea now take the lead on aggregate.  Just 2 minutes later while celebrations were still going on, another amazing ball from Kezman I believe, through to Duff with Belletti playing him ridiculously out wide for whatever reason,  Duff gets 1-on-1 with Valdes and puts it through his legs.  Holy crap, what a high, I screamed 3 times in 10 minutes.

Then the bad.  Ferreira with what could be called a harsh handball, but it had to be given, and Ronaldinho converts to get Barcelona back into the match.  Then the Ronaldinho goal out of nowhere, which made you ask, ""Did Ronaldinho just score?""  Beautiful goal, but at the time, I imagined it being the ugliest thing ever, why did he have to score the goal to give Barcelona the lead on away goals...

Barcelona get a lot of possession, a lot of chances, Cech with an incredible save on Eto'o I believe?  I also think Eto'o missed an open goal.

Time running out, here comes the corner.  ""In towards John Terry...IT'S THERE!  Chelsea have their noses in front again!  They can smell the quarterfinals again!""

Barcelona fans can complain all they want about Carvalho holding Valdes back, but Drogba was unfairly sent off in the first leg, and we all know Barcelona fans can hardly complain about referees in general.  Eto'o with some stupid words, made me want to punch him in the face that night.

He ended up warming up to Mourinho later as he was his manager, but given the current circumstances, no thanks, much rather have Lukaku up front than Eto'o.",0,1376403956,null,0,false,0,cbmu5se,t3_1k9gg4,t1_cbmu5se,t1_cbmquh0,null,1429845212,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

* You're going to need a tripod.
* Select the widest aperture you can - anywhere around and below f/4 is about right.
* Crank up the ISO to pretty much as high as possible - you're shooting digital so any photos at night are going to be noisy, unlike film where you won't really see any noise.
* Your shutter speed should be related to the the focal length of the lens you're using. To find out how long the exposure needs to be:
&gt;  Shutter Speed = 500 / Focal Length.

 For example, the photo I posted was taken with a wide angle lens with a focal length of 10mm. Therefore my shutter speed was (500/10) = 50 seconds. Anything longer than this and the stars start to blur due to the rotation of the earth. In reality, I found a sweet spot to be around ~47/48 seconds so I stuck with that.
* Set your focus to infinity and then take it back a bit. Focusing is one of the hardest things I found - a lot of this stage is trial and error. Live view can help if your camera has it.
* Then take your pictures! A self timer/remote release is certainly helpful - especially when your exposures are going over 30 seconds.
* Experimentation is key here, I probably took about 70/80 photos last night and only about 5 of them have come out any good. I'll definitely be giving it another try tonight.

Anyone can stop paying for the TV licence, so long as they're not watching live TV broadcasts.  I own two TVs and don't pay a TV licence, because I've not connected either to an aerial, which in fact is sealed up with tape and has a bookcase in front of it.

If one of their 'officers' ever came round and I was foolish enough to let them in (because as much as I like the BBC, their licence company are a shower of thuggish conmen and they need to change that), I'd simply point at the fact that my aerial's not been touched in years, and my TV's never even had the auto tune that most TVs get done 3 minutes after their out of the box.

I realise the response this will get, but I had a TV licence when I was working, and before I got long term ill, and should I return to work, I'd probably return to paying for it, partly for the convenience of being able to have it on when I like, and partly because I think the BBC is an inherently good thing.",0,1376405939,null,0,false,0,cbmusr2,t3_1k9m2d,t1_cbmusr2,t1_cbmuo2x,null,1429844913,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,pikeybastard,null,null,"the principle of 'competition' within the rail industry is that it competes with other forms of transport, such as cars, in the labour market, on procurement of things such as rolling stock, and in tendering- in other words, companies will compete to win a 7 year contract to run a service, and their bids will be considered on track record, cost-effectiveness, fare costs etc. The thing is, there is competition there but it isn't a constant market-driven pressure so much as a desire to convince government of a franchise's value, which means we aren't in structure that far away from the days of a nationalised train board.

What's interesting though is that there hasn't been much appetite in government for open access on-track competition, but that's beginning to change as multiple franchise holders are competing more directly. Grand Central and First Hull trains have improved services and reduced costs via competition without public subsidy, whilst reducing fares. You're absolutely right that it's an option that we should try, as reduced fares and better labour efficiency are the one failure of privatisation, where rail conditions, usage and services have generally improved but fares have risen at least as fast as the rest of Europe.

Is it all down to cold war history? Are they less paranoid about a World War happening again? Do they lack the same level of enemies that we face?

true,60_Second_Assassin,MM,myanmar,"One of the things that I'm looking forward to seeing this coming season is how JoMo incorporates the fantastic talent that's been coming out of our youth set up lately.  It used to be almost impossible for our younger players to get into the first team because we'd simply buy finished products for any position in which we were lacking, but now we have some serious talent knocking at the door for a spot in the line-up.  Players such as Lukaku and De Bruyne are familiar to most, and I think Ake and Kalas will also get some good playing time this season.  Also, u/kyhadley, who puts together some great individual player vids, was kind enough to manage a [spreadsheet](http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/1i6x6z/the_chelsea_fc_spreadsheet/) of all the players currently contracted to the club, including those on loan.  Might come in handy for your post.
