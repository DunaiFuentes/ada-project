Everyone gets infected, and they all let themselves die. They stop eating, drinking, talking, moving, and finally even breathing. Most of the population has already perished, but a relative few are still alive when The Doctor arrives.

The Doctor works out that a chemical has been widely released in the planet's terra-forming systems that blocks the human brain's ability to be motivated. In the process of finding a counter agent, he discovers that the planetary system government deliberately released the chemical as an experimental means of controlling the population. As he struggles to produce the cure, he continually yells at the people with him ""Don't lay down! Don't ever lay down!"" as laying down is the final stage before people stop even breathing.

The Doctor finds the cure in time to save the last few thousand people and warns them of their government's actions saying ""Don't let them get away with it"" before leaving. Unfortunately The Doctor doesn't realize that during the period when the cure acts on them, the people become **extremely** suggestible. Their every moment is now motivated by two things ""Don't ever lay down"" and ""Don't let them get away with it."" They consequently lose the ability to sleep (causing them to become increasingly crazy) and are driven by an unfocused desire for revenge against an unknown ""them.""

*Food: Within a 5 minute radius from Queens, Bookfinder's cafe is a minute walk down University Road, next to Danske Bank. It's a quiet, oldschool bookshop/café with free wifi and a ton of charm. Ryan's, opposite the museum, does arguably the best fry in Belfast, and The House Bar up the street (Stranmillis Road) does great pub food for a fiver. There's also a brand new kitchen opened in the Students Union, right opposite the Lanyon Building (The main QUB building you see). And as always, Boojum on Botanic is great, as if Maggie Mays.  
 
*Nightlife: Radar will be starting up again... it's a weekly, free local music night in the Speakeasy (upstairs) in the Student's Union, one of my favourites, always a crowd. Tuesday night in the Limelight is good n cheap, and Mondays at the Students Union are always busy (not sure what age you are though, that might be a factor in how much you'd enjoy that). There's traditional music in Kelly's Cellars in town (my favourite bar) from Wednesday to Friday, and in the Sunflower Bar on Saturdays. If you were interested in more, PM me and I could link you to some regular nights, I know a fair bit about the music scene here. 

*Bars: Towards town you have Lavery's, Filthy McNasty's, Stiff Kitten... standard student stuff. But if you make the effort, (which EVERYONE should... students here have a terrible habit of not venturing a mile further than the Dublin Road) get down to the Cathedral Quarter. My favourite bar trek starts at the back of the Victoria Square (it's a big shopping complex), in a triangular shaped old whiskey bar called Bittles. Start there then take a left and hit Alley Cat, Murials, The Spaniard, The Duke of York, The John Hewitt, maybe venturing to The Sunflower and Kelly Cellar's at some point too. If you're still alive head round to The Hudson for a great variety of beer and a dance. Again, give me a PM if you need details of these friggin' wonderful places. 

*Art/culture: Open House Festival run gigs sporadically through the year and they've never let me down. The MAC is a huge new complex housing a whole spectrum of the arts and is a fantastic building in itself. The Black Box is great for intimate gigs and has a great wee cafe during the day, and round the corner from that is the Oh Yeah Centre, something of a hub for the local music scene. Bigg Life Arts is where you'll find Terri Hooley in his record shop... please, please watch Good Vibrations before you come here. Please. There's a great restaurant/cafe/venue/ on The Barge, which you'll find by The Waterfront which is worth checking out... get the local cheese/meats platter. Unreal. The Lyric is the place to be for theatre, it's been recently refurbished and is just up Stranmillis Road, 5 minutes walk from Queens.

That's not a means of trying to discredit you, if anything it's the sort of opinion that makes me realise that my political beliefs and opinions are my own, but there are viable alternatives that may be preferable to others. 

As I see it, society is just that; everybody pays in when they can, and everyone else takes out what they need. In many cases, some people never see the benefits of some services - a sterile man has no use for a new midwife's wage, many people will never claim disability benefits, some unfortunate people will never have the chance to take HE funding. Areas of high wealth subsidise areas of lower wealth, but there will always be a few exceptions to the rule, but exceptions that in my opinion aren't a reason to be against the system.

That's how I see it anyway - the poorly educated disadvantaged guy might have a portion of his taxes go towards funding others get through university, but as graduates these people may well be helping to fund the disadvantaged guy through tax money being used to offer him help with complicated official documents, or paying for his prescriptions, or any number of social services that would come up.

So much of signings players is projecting future strength. If we get 5th we've reached that point. A few years ago we had a squad that was deteriorating every year and, therefore, needed to be added to in significant ways every summer.

Right now we have a squad that is going to get better every year. At GK we have a young player who will only get better. At defense we can basically consolidate ourselves for 1-2 more seasons. In midfield Lucas is at his level at least 2-3 more seasons. Gerrard is obviously petering off but we're no longer relying on him to change games.

Our whole attack is only going to get better (minus Suarez but I assume if we sell him we can get 1-2 people to replace his output). 

Right now our team gaining a year's age is much the same as some signings. 

Say you signed a top player worth 25-30 million pounds. Maybe he adds 10 goals and 10 assists in the Prem or some variation on 20 goals+assists altogether.

Well when you consider Sturridge is going to get better maybe give him 5-6 more goals/assists. Coutinho 5-6 more goals assists. Sterling more goals and assists.

true,nikcub,lfc68,null,"Liverpool can spend £6m a year without going into administration. We are already at -£17m on two years ago. That is just a bullshit scare tactic from people who don't understand the club finances.

Think it through, the club were prepared to spend £26m but not £30m, an extra 0.8m per year, because we would go into administration?

You are also confusing the reason why we went into administration, and it is very sad that Liverpool fans don't know the reason why (the lessons were not learned, it appears). There is a big difference between £300m in high interest debt, 10% of which is even higher interest PKI debt that is unsecured. That is £50m+ in interest payments per year that only gets worse.

You can't compare that with buying a player (and it is important for fans to know why we went into administration)

Here is the reality of what is going on (none of these excuses from fans are obviously true). Henry and Werner have a hard on for fixed financials, having a transfer budget, a set wage budget etc. Its why we didn't have the extra £2m for Dempsey last year and why we didn't have the extra £4m for Willian this year.

Fans have already taken them to account on this issue because it doesn't work in football. What we saw just then is a prime example - a player like Willian available and we don't have the flexibility to go after him. The way Henry responded to this criticism was to say ""for the right player, finances are no object"". So he is saying, don't worry about the transfer cap, because we will break it if the right player comes along.

You can't get any more a ""right player"" than willian. I don't care that the Wikipedia scouts here suddenly discover now that he is a terrible player, the guy is world class quality. You don't count too many more players above him before you get to Ronaldo and Messi. This is the *very definition* of right player, and the club failed to deliver on their promise.

We are contrained by this stupid transfer cap and it is stupid. It is embarrassing that Ian Ayre has to go to Russia and offer £26m plus a 50% sell on clause. Only paupers offer sell-on clauses, it is another way of saying you don't have cash. Meanwhile Spurs can come in and offer £30m as was asked by the club and get the deal done.

There is no risk here, on the smalll chance that Willian flops he is still a highly-rated £30m player that you can then sell to another club. Clubs all over the world including Chelsea, Spurs, Inter etc. fell all over each other to sign him in January.

And taking this 'cautious' approach applies to *every* player. You might as well not sign anybody.

A lot of the same arguments being used against Willian right now could just as easily have applied against Suarez 2.5 years ago. He isn't a top league, he hasn't done much etc. There is a reason why scouts have a hardon for Willian.

It is very obvious what is going on in this sub, the arguments are being twisted and designed to suit the facts to make the club appear right when they were far from it.

Granted, a lot of those were made by Moffat, but that just really drives home the point that he is much much better at writing a couple of episodes a season rather than being a showrunner. Those dolls I didn't find remotely terrifying, I found them laughable. The writer was trying too hard to make them scary by having the characters react to them rather than actually showing us why they were terrifying.

RTD's era will always be darker to me because nobody was invincible. Tennant's last episode terrified me because I thought Wilf might die.

It wont be true for everyone, but as it averages out the benefit will be there to see (and it's probably more cost efficient to accept the average than try to go case-by-case).

So where do you draw the line? I'm not sure. Perhaps put things on a scale of importance, and adjust how far you'll go depending on how much you have to spend (while maintaining a surplus, preferably). In particularly good times, I'd be all for supporting the arts and more 'happy' things to make our society a nicer place to live, because I do think a lot of people forget that that's actually an incredibly important thing to maintain, and capitalism can't carry the burden of that job alone - it can provide entertainment, but only if you can afford it.

Club officials know a great deal more than journalists, and even the journalists believe that Spurs is already spending Bale money. Spurs are being prudent by buying the replacements first, because prices are going to rise for them once the Bale sale is complete. There is nothing to prevent them from raising the bid once more to 40 if Liverpool matched the 35, and what then? Is the whole 'willing to spend 35, what's 5 more' argument going to come up again?

Furthermore, Willian would always have chosen Spurs over Liverpool if the wages etc were equal, because he would have gotten a first team place if Bale left, and even if the Bale deal fell through, Europa games would mean that he would get plenty of game time. Liverpool has lesser games than Spurs, and the left and central attacking positions are locked in by Coutinho and Suarez. Liverpool rightly doesn't want to spend obscene amounts of money for cover, and given a choice between a first team place for a club with European games that is closer to Champions League, and competing with two first team players in a club with no Europe, I think it would be clear what almost any player would prefer.

There are four more good matches right there... I suggest you look them up because 'one good match' is not how anybody in the world would describe Willian (it is frankly embarrassing)

I find it hard to believe that you would know anything about Willian and not know his high profile games in England, or that you would say he has had 'one good match'.

I've actually watched Shakhtar play, and I can tell you I was very very impressed by their forward line and Willian in particular on more than one ocassion.

true,szlafarski,lfc99,,"I think Suarez may have earned a spot on the short list of players who fall under that category.

As for who those players are, I'm going to try and compile a list of who that COULD be.

Borini - he's got loads of promise and talent in him. Dirk Kuyt with pace and a good touch. He's still young but this year will be important for him. He's playing with the U21's (a reminder of how young this guy is, despite looking as old as Stevie G - dat beard) and doing great so far. Hopefully his cup runs will prove fruitful.

Skrtel - he muffed up quite a bit last season but I imagine it was a matter of transition of styles of play. It took him two solid seasons of regular playing time beside Carra before he really 'bloomed' as a player. His abilities will be out to the test. He also has a lot to prove like Borini.

Wisdom - this kid has a LOT of talent in him. He did really well for us last year at RB, but BR seems to want him back in his original role as a CB. He did good in the preseason until the Celtic match which proved he is certainly still a kid. 

Jones - a major part of why we made It to the FA Cup final under Kenny was because of him. The reason we got knocked out so early this time around was also down to him. I think he's done all he can for us and if given a chance this season he might take it, he might not. Can't blame him though, if my young boy died the way his did two years back, I would never be the same again, certainly when it came to my job. He has a place in my heart - or rather, they both do.

Coates - he's been on both ends of the spectrum. He's made some AMAZING tackles and some of the best clearances out of the box I have ever seen from a defender. That being said, he's got poor positioning and since he's 6'5"" pace isn't on his side. I want him to go on loan to a team like Fulham, West Brom etc to get regular playing time and prove his worth. 

**Touré - clearly a still a GREAT defender, however statistically weak in the air, which was a problem for us last year which I'm sure you all remember.

The Doctor’s ultimate solution to the problem is to order Amy to change into more conservative clothes rather than urge Rory to exhibit some self-control.

Even if Rodgers doesn't make that choice, he should. The bench needs to help options.

Allen can play either of the three CM positions. It might involve a shift in approach but he can do that. Sterling is the wing and because of the versatility of our starters thats fine.

The only reason Torres has more starts than Soldado is because he was a better player for longer, not to mention older. From 2001-2007, Torres appeared 214 times, scoring 82 goals. Soldado appeared 166 times (120 for Real Madrid **B**, and only scored 77 times. It's no wonder why Torres is selected before Soldado, it's not even a question. Just think for a second. Now before you go saying these statistics prove Torres is better and Soldado isn't world class...

It's a little funny that Spurs wouldn't have raised the bid if they were allowed to, because they more or less need Willian if Bale was on the way out, and outbidding another competing club is the easiest way to secure the deal. In addition, it is always possible that the player had agreed terms with both clubs and the final price was being negotiated on. Your point about Anzhi being desperate to sell doesn't make sense, because player terms take like a day or two to finalise. If Willian really rejected Spurs, Anzhi could easily go back to Liverpool for the original price. You think Liverpool would have thrown a childish fit and rejected that deal? 

As far as available information goes, Liverpool saw an opportunity for a good player who could be cover and went for it. When an opponent that had more to offer financially and footballing wise came in and the price rose, Liverpool decided to back off because they didn't want to get into a bidding war for a cover player. Anything more, and I'm afraid you'll have to provide more solid proof. Mainly, proof that Willian would have chosen Liverpool over Spurs, that Anzhi would not have raised the price further, and that Spurs were definitely not getting into a bidding war.

true,nikcub,lfc68,null,"&gt; I don't know why Barrett, a LFC fan, or any other person would confuse what FSG and Rodgers have said. They've been clear since the Carroll debacle that they aren't going to overpay

I will tell you why. Because people are starting to see through it, the emperor has no clothes. Previously it was cute when Henry would say things like 'resigning Suarez is like signing a new player', or about how we shouldn't worry about the American style transfer budgets because *for the right player* the resources are there.

I excused last season and chalked it up as a learning experience (even though I was adamant against Dempsey and Sig). But it is 3 years now and at some point, just like a prospect player, you have to realize that you need to knuckle down and start getting things down instead of always talking about how great the future is supposed to be. Henry is now a striker in his mid-20's who isn't scoring many goals and who we need to loan or sell to Serie B. 

The overpaying excuse is an amercanism that Arsene Wenger has also bought into. In America sports teams boom and bust in cycles so waiting an extra year to get a player on a better contract makes sense, same with things like clearing cap space and tanking for 2 seasons. That doesn't happen in football. We have global competition and a finite number of players. There are only 40 or so top class talented players in the world that can dramatically improve a team and in any transfer window only 1 or 2 of them become available.

With 10 clubs looking to buy 2 players, simple supply and demand economics will tell you that the 'value' of that player isn't what Club 4 think it is, the value is the greatest amount that any of the clubs would pay. It is condescending to fans when owners roll their eyes and tell us that their valuation, which is as good as a made up number, was *more correct than what a player sold for*. 

To compound this, we know that Liverpool's valuations are not a function of scouting, they are a function of the available finances. Do you think if Liverpool had a £30m transfer fun this season that we would not have bought Willian for the extra 4? It is financial austerity designed to keep us motoring in mediocrity dressed up as financial prudence. 

You can't be tight in football, *all* the money goes to the players - it is, afterall, who we are spending our money to see. The alternative is that the money goes back to the owners, which is what Henry wants. I'd prefer it goes to players, and that Henry is nothing more than a custodian of the club. The deal is that he gets the capital appreciation and that in return should mean that he invests in the club (not to mention he bought the club *for a steal* of a price).

&gt; Last year that got us Coutinho and Sturridge instead of Siggurdsson (or however its spelled) and Dempsey.

false choice. correlation/causation etc. 

if you miss out on Ribery, does that mean you will sign Messi in 6 months? no

to figure out if your theory is a good one or not, extrapolate it further. this idea falls apart pretty quickly (again causation/correlation) 

&gt; Everyone should realize what a club says a player is worth is not the same as what he is going to be worth to his next club. Willian for the reported 35 would be 10 million over his likely worth. FSG were essentially okay overpaying by 5 million. Not 10. I'm okay with that decision.

again, you are essentially arguing that Willian's transfer value *is not* the actual number that 3 clubs have offered for him, but rather a figure you pluck out of the air. how do you justify that?

People should remember that the last 3 times we have gone head to head with Spurs for signing, the so called winner came out the loser.

1. Joe Cole - We win and get Joe!!! YAY!! Um, no - Spurs miss out on Joe but the poor basterds get Vdv on the last day of window. Good thing we go Joe instead.

2. Gylfi Sigurðsson - Spurs win and we get Joe Allen instead -I prefer Joe as im sure Spurs fan prefer Gylfi but one thing is for sure, we wouldn't have been a better team if we had gotten Gylfi.

3. Clint Dempsey - Spurs win and we get no one -Thank fucking god we didn't get Dempsey. Yes we suffered for half a season but instead we got Sturridge, while Tottenham sold off Dempsey this summer.

I am not saying Wallin will be a shit player for them, I rate him as a player. But just cause it feels like we're losing now, doesn't mean come Sept 3rd we didnt luck out and got something better.

The value is not something you can research and establish, it is something that can only be determined by what your counterparties (in this case other clubs) are willing to pay for it. 

You can't value it with the market and then second you can't walk away from it. Competing for a player is a zero sum game, either you gain him or your competitor gains him. When your compeitor gains him they are +1 player while you are -1 player, so in effect you are -2. The next player you find to fill that gap has to be *better* than the last player you missed out on, so it only becomes *more expensive*

It would be different if another club could just clone another copy of Willian, and we could go to them and offer £26M, but they can't. 

What makes this worse is there is a very limited number of good players, so missing out on one is bad, but missing out on three and leaving yourself 2 weeks to find someone is even worse.

As for the Tony Barrett piece, do you mean [this one in the picture?](https://twitter.com/Anfield_Talk/status/369922788037230592/photo/1) Because as far as I know, it doesn't state any of your claims. 

If Liverpool matched Spurs at 30 million pounds, and Spurs upped their bid to 35, was there anything preventing Anzhi from rejecting Liverpool's 30 million bid for Spurs'? Anything preventing Anzhi from raising the price? 

There is a difference between overpaying for a player that you definitely want and need, and overpaying for a player that would be good to have but not necessary. Willian would be competing for a starting place in Liverpool, and locked into a starting place in Spurs. Locked. He knows this. Liverpool obviously refused to get into a bidding war with Spurs either over the transfer fee or the wages for a player that they need less than Spurs. 

What is this shitty situation you speak of? The one that allowed Dalglish to spend almost 100 million pounds? The one that gave Brendan Rodgers 20+ million to spend on Joe Allen alone? The only example I can think of was Dempsey, who was a long term target and it was known as a mistake. Willian isn't a long term target, he was an opportunity. Liverpool looked at attacking midfielders earlier in the window because they were faced with the possibility of losing Suarez. They stopped needing an attacking midfielder because the threat of Suarez leaving ended. An opportunity for Willian came up and they looked at it, but stopped bothering once Spurs were in the picture.

true,zweep,cnty-scotland,A traitor separatist.,"Get a cooking book off your mum, buy yourself a crockpot and learn to snoop out bargains on food in the shops, you can make all kinds of meals in a crockpot and more importantly you can make those meals last days. You'll save a lot more than your mates who waste their money on pot noodles and takeouts and you will have a much better diet too.

Learn to limit how much you will drink and don't let your mates convince you just to ""go out for a few"" because you'll end up spending more than you need to and unless you might your soul mate it's money better off saved. Obviously that doesn't mean you can't go out and enjoy yourself and meet girls but just remember there is always next weekend to go out.


Budget your expenses and save a little each week, doesn't matter how much but just take a little money each week/month and put it into a bank account and let it build because unexpected things or emergencies can happen at any time and it's nice to have a litle cushion in case you do.

Learn to cook and say no to always drinking and you are already ahead of 99% of the others you'll encounter, not to mention it will be skills you use for the rest of your life. 

Edit: I know I already sound like a buzzkill but something else is, on the days off you might have try not to waste them all doing nothing. I'm not telling you not to enjoy yourself or not take a break but it's always good to be improving yourself in one way or another.

I do believe a Willian or Lamela could be the star players we need to put us over the top but, certainly, that is just an opinion not an irrefutable fact. However, the fact remains that LFC cleared a ton off its wage bill, had a supposed 25M kitty to start with and I believe are currently at a net positive transfer fee wise. With that amount of money, they can and should flex their muscles if the right player comes along. At least in Willian's case, they decided not to.

""Personally, I'd say Lamela is worth what someone is willing to pay and what Roma are willing to sell for.""

&gt; If Liverpool matched Spurs at 30 million pounds, and Spurs upped their bid to 35, was there anything preventing Anzhi from rejecting Liverpool's 30 million bid for Spurs'? Anything preventing Anzhi from raising the price?

No, there is nothing preventing them. But you are taking two steps in a hypothetical world. If this excuse can be summarized as ""you shouldn't bid, because they might just raise the asking price"", then that can be applied to **every transfer, ever**. You would be paralyzed and never able to make a bid. 

You increase your bid to £30m like they asked. If they increase the asking price to £35m then you tell them to get the fuck out and you leave. You don't hypothesize about what they might do.

But do you know why none of this matters? Because what you describe is simply an excuse to match the facts. It isn't what happen. The club aren't even using it as an excuse, the fans are already making excuses for them. You are *assuming* that this is what happen, because you are rattling your mind to find something that explains the sheer insanity going on here but that doesn't reflect poorly on Liverpool.

Fact is Liverpool didn't have the funds to match. Simple.

&gt; Willian would be competing for a starting place in Liverpool, and locked into a starting place in Spurs. 

I haven't heard this one yet. Interesting line to take, that he would walk into a team that finished 11 points ahead of us and have added 6 strong players to their side but he would compete for a place at Liverpool. I don't think I follow the logic, but its an interesting argument. 

btw considering Henderson started the game on the weekend, I think it is safe to say that Willian might do ok with playing time at Liverpool. just maybe.

&gt; that gave Brendan Rodgers 20+ million to spend on Joe Allen alone?

This is where you lose your argument. When you start making numbers up. Allen was a £15 million purchase and best yet he is on £35k per week, so as total cost he is one of the cheapest players in the squad. He costs less than half of a Henderson. 

&gt; What is this shitty situation you speak of?

It is negative £17m net in wages over the past two years while other clubs have increased revenue 20%+ and wages as a proportion of revenue. Quoting transfer fees alone is 10% of the story, you have to look at the complete picture. The complete picture for Liverpool is that we aren't even spending what we earn in revenue and the clubs has been loaded with debt, again.

The other part of the shitty situation is that transfer caps, an idea taken from US sports administration, do not work in football. It means you end up with your hands tied when once-a-season opportunities like Willian come along.

We could have learned that lesson last season, but we didn't.

&gt; They stopped needing an attacking midfielder because the threat of Suarez leaving ended.

You realize Rodgers is on the record as little as 3 days ago saying that he needs backup for Coutinho? Why are you making excuses for them? If you take the sum of what Rodgers has said ('we have finished building the squad, now we build the team' after the first 4 signings, that was 6 weeks ago).

Dont be so naive. Off course he didn't say that, which manager would ever say that about any target? Heck Ancelotti isn't even saying that about Bale.

&gt; I'm pretty sure if Rodgers had Willian as the only player he wanted the rest of the window they would have made a better bid.

You'd think so, right. Which is my entire argument - it turns out he didm't because he didn't have the funds. So now what?

&gt; I don't however think you can wipe away the transfer record since FSG took over just 

Wait, how is what Dalglish did now being used to argue against me? I was against that as well. I still want to sell Henderson because of his ridiculous contract. 

My point is completely that the owners have contracted too much since that. They over-corrected. People keep saying 'youd think if they wanted him they would pay for him' but the fact is that they didn't. They always said *for the right player* the funds would be there, and you can't get any more a right player than Willian - so where were the funds?

We are too close to the end of the window. It was only luck in the first place that gave us even a sniff of Willian, that type of luck won't land in our laps again between now and the end of the window.

The more I think about it, and the more well-thought-out arguments I read on this sub, the more I think the club is doing the right thing. We don't have the money that some other clubs have. We can't afford to overpay for players, and we have to be careful about spending large sums of money.

If Man City buy a player for £35 million and the player is a flop it's not that big a deal. They sell him at a loss when they can and buy someone else. For us it is a big deal (see Andy Carroll). Success for us is about using our scouting to identify players that the market has undervalued (see Philippe Coutinho) and developing young talent.

I've been as frustrated as anyone by this transfer window, but really I'm glad that our owners have the patience and discipline to stick to a plan. Let's see how we spend the £35 million we didn't spend on Willian before we make our judgment.

The downside to this is obviously the environmental pollution, contaminating the local water supply,substantially increase the price of the water in the area and LNG pipes need to be built to transport this stuff around. However not all shale gas is extracted using fracking, some plays can be exploited by conventional wells. Every year we complain about the rising heating bill, and the reliance on politically unstable regions for our energy, and the declining manufacturing industry in Britain. If shale gas exploration is successful then our gas bill would fall, we are going to import less from countries in the middle east or Russia and our manufacturing will be more competitive because lower energy costs. Keep in mind LNG fuel would be cheaper as a result of shale gas, this would lead to more demand to cars running on the cleaner LNG fuel. So should we consider developing shale gas plays?

My point was unless Rodgers saw Willian as the perfect player for his squad, it doesn't really matter how much other people rate him.  I haven't seen anything stating how much Rodgers really rated Willian as a player fitting into his Liverpool squad.  So he might not have been willing to spend his whole budget on Willian.

They may have over-corrected some, but I think its going to take Rodgers being 100% confident in a transfer for them to over come their past transfer history.  If he wanted him so much we would have been linked with him before.

I do agree however that Liverpool should be getting bids accepted for any serious target that they have, that is for sale.  It is not an acceptable excuse saying the player would have picked someone else anyways if they didn't have a bid accepted.  They should know before approaching other teams whether or not they can afford to be doing so.  If a player is up for a move there is a good indication of how much said player is worth or is going to be sold for.

This doesn't necessarily apply to your above comment, but I still don't understand why people are going on and on about how we missed out on Costa as a transfer.

Probably not, but he's still quite good and in terms of value for money, he's spot on there and unfortunately that's the sort of world we live in at the moment here as LFC supporters .  

I don't think the £25M kitty thing ever existed and it's not really the way FSG work.  This seems to be some sort of fallacy and I can't figure out where this idea even stems from, to be honest.  In general, FSG will be supportive, but within reason.  That's pretty much it- there is no specific number attached to that statement and I think far too much is made of transfer policies that don't really exist.

As far as the positive transfer fee, I don't think we're quite positive.  People tend to ignore fees and such when they do the maths on those things (e.g. we didn't make £15.5M on Carroll, you have to take out minimum 5% for his loyalty bonus, Toure wasn't free as he likely got a sizable signing bonus, other incomings are due VAT, agent's fees, VAT on agent's fees, relocation packages, signing bonuses, etc.).  All that said, I'd concur we're not exactly hugely in the red on transfers either to be honest.  This frankly doesn't surprise me as I expected this summer to be fairly revenue neutral as I think FSG's actions lately have shown to some degree shall we say restraint on the financial front.

Appreciate the reasoned debate rather than a downvote.

Its very strange that there's all this hype that we would not be spending like this if we have not already put a deal in place because teams would over charge. And yet, everyone has already come to the conclusion that the deal is done anx just not yet announced. Wouldn't that mean that teams would still be trying to drive up prices?
I read all the time how Spurs have one of the wealthiest owners in England, and Levy wants to build a brand and win trophies. Wouldn't it make since for the ownership to look at Bale as the marquee player and build a great team around him? Don't get me wrong, I know its a shot in the dark.
But if the top brass sat down at the end of last year and said ""we have one of the best players in the world right now AT OUR FUCKING CLUB. Either we go all in for the Champions League and the EPL Title now or we sell and start from scratch.""
AVB stated that be turned down offers to leave. Baldini, the puppet master, came over. And Spurs spent money on solid transfer targets.
I think this all trails back to last summer when AVB arrived and culture started to change from 'arry's team. 
Again, don't get me wrong if Bale's sale brings us all of these gifts then he leaves Spurs far better than he found us. But we shouldn't under estimate what his departure means from a marketing stand point with regards to turning Spurs into a global brand.

RANT OVER/Rationality takes over:
Look all these beautiful signings!!!! Marketing be damned I want to lift a damn trophy. We've made the moves to ensure we will be much better this season and the top 4 should be a minimum goal for spurs. The only reason Bale hasn't turned in his transfer request is because he never had to. Levy had it ready and he just had to sign and wait it out.

true,Fixes_GrammerNazi_,null,null,"&gt;Optimism. ..so different. Some the European spurs fans can probably answer this for me, but have we over paid for any of the new signings? Its very strange that there's all this hype that we would not be spending like this if we have not already put a deal in place because teams would over charge. And yet, everyone has already come to the conclusion that the deal is done anx just not yet announced. Wouldn't that mean that teams would still be trying to drive up prices?
I read all the time how Spurs have one of the wealthiest owners in England, and Levy wants to build a brand and win trophies. Wouldn't it make since for the ownership to look at Bale as the marquee player and build a great team around him? Don't get me wrong, I know its a shot in the dark.
But if the top brass sat down at the end of last year and said ""we have one of the best players in the world right now AT OUR FUCKING CLUB. Either we go all in for the Champions League and the EPL Title now or we sell and start from scratch.""
AVB stated that be turned down offers to leave. Baldini, the puppet master, came over. And Spurs spent money on solid transfer targets.
I think this all trails back to last summer when AVB arrived and culture started to change from 'arry's team. 
Again, don't get me wrong if Bale's sale brings us all of these gifts then he leaves Spurs far better than he found us. But we shouldn't under estimate what his departure means from a marketing stand point with regards to turning Spurs into a global brand.

&gt;RANT OVER/Rationality takes over:
Look all these beautiful signings!!!! Marketing be damned I want to lift a damn trophy. We've made the moves to ensure we will be much better this season and the top 4 should be a minimum goal for spurs. The only reason Bale hasn't turned in his transfer request is because he never had to. Levy had it ready and he just had to sign and wait it out. I think if he had stayed there would a statue built for him outside of the new stadium but if all of the new players work oht and this truly is the Bale-out money we're spending then we may owe him that much either way.

History and time made the clerics change, a simple idea placed into someone's mind can change the course of the future.

true,Andures,null,null,"Before I start, I was mistaken about Allen's price, as I remember newpaper reports saying he was for 24 million pounds. Like I said, I'm not a Liverpool fan, so I should have fact-checked. 

&gt; You increase your bid to £30m like they asked. If they increase the asking price to £35m then you tell them to get the fuck out and you leave. You don't hypothesize about what they might do.

So how does this logic not work for when it was 26m + addons? Are you saying that Anzhi would not have agreed for that offer if Spurs didn't come in with 30 straight? I don't get where your starting point and ending point is. In many transfers, the full amount is seldom paid up front. It is often through installments or add-ons per appearance etc. There is just as much chance that Anzhi did not reject Liverpool's bid, but chose the Spurs bid. I have no doubt whatsoever that if both Liverpool and Spurs bid 26m + addons, Anzhi would have accepted it. We're not talking about incredibly low-ball bids, like 15m for a player that they price at 30. Liverpool, by all reports, were negotiating on the 30m by using addons. Spurs decided to skip the entire negotiation by bidding 30m. They skipped a process that happens in almost all transfers, showing their intent to outbid Liverpool. 

&gt;If this excuse can be summarized as ""you shouldn't bid, because they might just raise the asking price"", then that can be applied to every transfer, ever. You would be paralyzed and never able to make a bid.

Now you are taking my words out of context. I'm saying that Liverpool shouldn't have raised their bid because they knew that there was an opponent coming in with a clear intent to outbid them, and that Anzhi would just have raised the minimum bid so that they would be able to profit from the highest bidder. This is in conjunction with what I said about Willian not being a necessary part of Liverpool. The best comparison is in how Monaco, PSG and even Manchester City were more-or-less unopposed in their transfers. No one bothered to bid the 
'minimum' amount, because they knew that these clubs would simply up their bid. There are quite a few clubs in the world who would love to have one of Cavani, Falcao, Jovetic, Navas or Moutinho in their teams. They all stopped short because they **knew** that PSG, Monaco or Manchester City would just outbid them. 

&gt;Fact is Liverpool didn't have the funds to match. Simple.

The same article by Barrett argues that Liverpool has the money to spend, they just don't want to. 

&gt;btw considering Henderson started the game on the weekend, I think it is safe to say that Willian might do ok with playing time at Liverpool. just maybe.

Or maybe it's because Suarez is still suspended. Just maybe. 

&gt;This is where you lose your argument. When you start making numbers up. Allen was a £15 million purchase and best yet he is on £35k per week, so as total cost he is one of the cheapest players in the squad. He costs less than half of a Henderson.

So the entire argument is lost because of a wrong number in half a point? I concede that the number was wrong. So does the fact that FSG approved 1 summer of big spending, and had 2 (including this one) of lesser spending spell a definite trend? 

&gt;I haven't heard this one yet. Interesting line to take, that he would walk into a team that finished 11 points ahead of us and have added 6 strong players to their side but he would compete for a place at Liverpool. I don't think I follow the logic, but its an interesting argument.

The logic that follows how since we are following news reports, we would have to concede that Spurs is losing Bale, and they want Willian to replace his position on the first team? The one where even if both Willian and Lamela join Spurs, they will be fighting for an empty seat while Willian would need to dislodge a more-or-less established first team player in Liverpool? 

&gt;The club aren't even using it as an excuse, the fans are already making excuses for them. You are assuming that this is what happen, because you are rattling your mind to find something that explains the sheer insanity going on here but that doesn't reflect poorly on Liverpool.

What are the facts? That Liverpool was interested, but didn't want to overspend, thus proving that Liverpool doesn't have any more money than 26 million? If Everton prices Fellaini at 30 million and United doesn't pay, does that mean United doesn't have the money? United didn't pay the 20m (reported) to trigger Thiago's release clause, this means they don't have the money? Chelsea (amongst other clubs) didn't pay 60 million for Falcao. Same deal? 

&gt;You realize Rodgers is on the record as little as 3 days ago saying that he needs backup for Coutinho?

Backup. 30 million as backup for a 7 million player. **BACKUP**. Is it great to have a backup? Sure. Necessary, even. 30 million for a backup? Really? 

&gt;Really, you don't have to defend the club so blindly, they have PR people who do that work for them and they are paid for it.

I think both Liverpool and Spurs were smart in their dealings here. Spurs skipped the negotiations to buy a necessary replacement in their first team. Liverpool chose not to overpay for a back-up player. I believe that the furthest Liverpool can go in this season is 5th, accounting for their attractiveness to players via their financial situation and the football available. I see that their transfer dealings more or less reflect this reality (or prediction, if you may). I see a lot of similarities between Liverpool this year and Spurs last year, or even the year before. I consider this a prudent strategy, because it is the only way to organically compete with the bigger clubs in my opinion.

It looks like someone needs a word after what I've read from last night. 

&gt;talk hand lotion (seriously... what's good stuff?)

Currently using Aveeno, and even for my old woman hands (I'm not being dramatic, I was born with them due to dry skin) it's really good. Got it in Waitrose. 

&gt;talk makeup

I finally got a plum lipstick yesterday, but the sellotape on it pulled the shiny off. Wtf is that all about? Sellotape on makeup really pisses me off. There isn't a good selection of plum colours out there at the moment, so I may be searching for the right shade for a long time. The one I ended up buying has got a bit of sparkle in it, and I really wanted a darker, much more matte shade really. I suspect I'll end up spending £20 on a Mac shade or something.

Also, Amazon, no I don't want to wait 20+ days for you to deliver my favourite replacement lippy to me. Especially not since you're advertising that you have five in stock when I cancel my order, you utter bastards. 

&gt;Who here rides motorbikes? What we riding?

I wish. A Yamaha R1 please. Not going to happen as I can't even walk straight without hurting myself. Spent a summer on the back of motorbikes with an ex once and loved it. Group of us used to meet up weekly/on weekends for bike club. Anyone ever been to the Ace Cafe in London? Lots of leather and bikes there, sometimes classic cars and the like. I MISS THE BIKES.

Yes, football is about passion and excitement, and Bale is arguably a once-in-a-generation footballer for our club.  The whole reason I started supporting Spurs originally was because we had David Ginola, a magician in an otherwise average team.

But... I think what you're discounting is the potential for other players to fill the void.  Bale is a unique talent, but would it be any less exciting to see Lamela scoring the goal that qualifies us for the Champions League, Soldado volleying home the winner over Arsenal, Willian orchestrating a magical win over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge?

You're emotionally attached to Bale because he's been around for years... it's time to give some other talents a chance.

And finally, for me the choice of the money is totally emotional because it's clear to me he doesn't particularly want to be at Spurs anymore.  We have no definitive ""quotes"" from him, but the lack of any kind of denial (even one of those stereotypical, meaningless ""I'm happy as a Spurs player for now but you never know what will happen in football"") speaks volumes.

true,nikcub,lfc68,null,"&gt; Or what? I'm not sure I understand what you think FSG should be doing differently.

Ok, i'll approach it from that perspective. There are a few things, and note this isn't a knee-jerk reaction to Willian but an opinion i've held for a long time. I sent a lot of these to the club in a letter nearly a year ago.

1. We need a director of football. This provides better checks and balances when you separate team management, scouting and then recruiting and signing players.

2. We need a commercial directory. Ayre has been weak on deals. We have one of the largest fan bases in the world and our commercial results don't match that. We are third in shirt sales but once the Warrior deal is in its last year it won't even be in the top 10. Ayre was weak there, weak on the renewal of Standard Chartered and on player contracts - such as the Suarez situation (which would be a DoF responsibility). United did very well here, they bought in experienced sports and commercial managers and their commercialization is at a different level to the rest of the clubs, they are leaving us behind.

3. Better development of the online fan base. The website is something out of the 90's. Most fans engage outside of official channels since the website has a membership barrier and an old website. That content should be free, and users should have a license to create their own highlight videos instead of taking them down from YouTube. Doing social media is more than just registering accounts on Twitter and Facebook and posting the same titles and linking on the website .

4. Abandon the transfer budget. It doesn't work in football and we have seen why. You need the flexibility to take advantage of impromptu opportunities such as the Willian transfer.

5. To become a consistent 4th place team you need to invest like a 4th place team. It is very rare in the history of the Premier League that the 3rd or 4th place side establish their place there by outperforming on wages. We can't get there organically. Three possible solutions:

a) Raise a line of credit on the club. The club has a lot of equity and we could have a comfortable level of debt to invest in the squad over three years

b) Sell a stake in the club to a minority partner and invest their equity into the stadium and squad rather than taking the money off the table

c) Have the owners invest the money. It doesn't have to be a lot - it will return itself in spades with a return to the Big 4 and boost the overall value of the club greatly.

6. In the short-term we need to expand wages at least to the level they were at in 10/11. That means an extra £16M or so, which we can manage. The new EPL FFP is into effect this year and with the wage cap increases it could have us locked in at our current wage levels. The other clubs have already increased, and if it gets locked in the way it is now then we will be left behind.

There is a lot more, I can't remember it all at the moment. I think a good example is the Manchester United campaign. They won 3 out of 5 titles but their fans were still not satisfied. The campaign from the fans turned the ownership around and saw them retain players with larger contracts. The fans there know where their place should be, for some reason the majority of Liverpool fans are ok with excusing the club (even before the club comes out with their own reasoning). I don't think that is right, I think we need to be critical where it applies and praise them where it applies in other cases, but never blindly supportive of ever action.",0,1377068543,null,0,false,0,cbs5fuh,t3_1krb5l,t1_cbs5fuh,t1_cbs3x4y,null,1429754488,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Also interested in your choice of words. It sounds very much like the argument that because, say, an African dictatorship is corrupt and large portions of the aid budget go missing, we should no longer supply aid. But that's a matter for individual conscience. My point is that governments need to be above individual conscience. 

Take the argument about crimes against the individual. Say your sister / daughter / mother was raped and murdered. You, as an individual, are unable to see the matter in context. You would quite possibly, if you had the chance, want to exact comparable revenge on the person that did it. The state has a duty to be above those considerations, just as it has a duty to show compassion and support to states struggling with national disasters, or generally poor living standards, or whatever. To conflate that idea with the notion of propping up the corrupt regime that runs the country is a rabble-rousing, right-wing sentiment that uses supposed pragmatism as an excuse for callousness, and I simply won't agree with it.

Over the last 20-odd years we've seen a massive increase in the number of people attending university without a similar increase in the amount of funding. You don't need advanced maths qualifications to realise that something must be suffering if the funding per student is not increasing. The old model which you love so much did not cater for such large numbers.

Getting more students in to higher education is generally desirable but one problem with the funding model is that students pick courses which may sound exciting but once they graduate they have ""worthless"" degrees from an employers perspective. You don't have to spend long on reddit to hear people complain about such things.

In my opinion we'd be better letting universities charge whatever they wanted for courses - much like the US does, and have the state and other bodies elect to pay for so many students in subjects that society would benefit from e.g. physics, maths, IT, chemistry. Clearly, media and philosphy should also be funded but probably to a lesser amount. 

As someone else pointed out further down the thread those who do not attend university for whatever reason also end up helping to fund those that do. One may argue that those people do benefit from the skills acquired but it is somewhat perverse that money from poorer people is used to fund the middle classes to help them reenforce their position.

I don't think, that anyone claims, that you've never heard of the mentioned targets. The thing which bothers me is, that it seems to me (!, nobody knows what's going on behind the curtains), that the Liverpool officials grade the way, open talks with the club/player, they reason why a transfer to the Premier League is attractive and fits perfectly for the player. There are negotiations, they talk about money, are ready to reach a agreement. And then, Daniel Levy is in. That's what I understand as the main point of this highjacking, benefit from the work of others. 

But, and that's important for me, I'm not bitter because of that. First of all, because the only bitterness I feel, is because we don't get the player, which I'd really like to get. That's the big, bitchy thing about the transfer market; hearing a rumour, get curious, then excited because it seems close and in the end there's disappointment. And at the second thought, it's how the market rolls, it's about winning or losing. What really annoys me, is that we seem to be unable to perform deals on ""marquee"" players, before any other has the chance to get into it. Therefore, I don't know, how we should get big signings without overpaying.

1. Amy pond after nearly no time at all has 100% faith in the Doctor. 
 
* I think its important to remember that she spent basically her entire life up until The Doctor finally returned, waiting for him to come back. Just imagine, if you will, every stressful situation you've ever been in. In all of those times, I bet at least once or twice, you wanted to run away. Amy spent a lot of time hoping and wishing he would come back. People thought she was crazy. She herself began believing that he was merely a figment of her imagination. She had just recently started to move on with her life, when suddenly he's back, saving the world from the [Atraxi](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Atraxi), a pretty intimidating sight to behold if you've never seen an alien before. I'd have 100% faith too. 

* She doesn't need to know his backstory to be interested in him. She did ask, often, but the 11th Doctor was so childlike, he seemed to not want to talk about it much, and considering the dangers they'd soon be facing in every episode, and the Doctors unwillingness to share, she always dropped it. I just assume she liked a bit of mystery to her men. meh.

4. No reference to anything from his past

* That simply isn't true. Did you watch Lets Kill Hitler? When he was poisoned and dying, the Tardis's Emergency Voice interface? GIVE ME MORE GUILT, and it shows Rose, Marth, and Donna! Also, I think Him not mentioning much from his past was because that was the 11th's entire personality. 11 was supposed to be the youngest of the Doctors. He's basically a child throwing a temper tantrum! He is always running. That has been the central THEME of Moffat's Doctor this whole time. Running from the past, and being unable to outrace guilt.

5.  Bigger is better. Every episode attempts to create this huge worldly threat. Why cant the threat be localized? why does the whole earth or an entire civilization always have to be at stake?

* that's simply not true. The episode in the hotel, localized. The episode on the The Pirates ship, localized. the Doctors wife, localized. The two episodes with Craig, localized. 

7. Amy has no sense of wonder? 

* that was her personality. I got the impression she was faking her confidence the whole time. The emotional depth of a tree stump? You remember When Van Gogh and she was unknowingly crying, even though she didn' know why? She had plenlty of emotional depth. 

9. not subtle. 

* what about the tweed jacket in The time Of angels? They never even made mention of that, for Christ's sake. Last I checked  Bad Wolf Appeared EVERYWHERE. there was nothing more or less subtle between any of the Doctors.

true,buildmonkey,eu,Fake Yorkshireman,"With regard to improperly qualified ATOS assessors there is an extremely useful Upper Tribunal decision that came out recently where a physiotherapist had assessed someone with severe mental health problems as being fit for work. The judge, in strictly legal terms, threw a fit, and ruled that:

&gt;22 - Where, however, the disability analyst is a physiotherapist and the problems she is dealing with are mental health problems the *opinion of the physiotherapist as to the conclusions to be drawn have no probative value whatsoever*...

&gt;23 -  I can only express my surprise that in a case where the only issue was the mental health of the claimant and its effect in relation to the mental health descriptors, the report was prepared by a physiotherapist following a 15 minute interview.  It is plainly important that *questions of mental health should be assessed by a disability analyst with appropriate mental health qualifications if their opinion is to be of any evidential value*.  *Even then tribunals should beware of placing too much weight on such reports, based as they are on a very short interview with a claimant and without access to medical records*.

This opinion is legal precedent and *must* be followed by decision-makers (if they are forced to at gunpoint by someone that knows about it) and tribunals (again, if you tell them about it). This applies until another Upper Tribunal judge makes a conflicting ruling. At least two things come from it:

* The ATOS assessor must have some degree of medical expertise in the area. We can now argue that a physically qualified assessor cannot assess mental health and vice versa, we should be able to argue that a mental health assessor cannot assess learning difficulty and so on, although this is by extension.

* We can argue that even where they were qualified, if it was a short examination without access to medical records then ""tribunals should beware of placing too much weight on such reports"".

You make claim.

DWP pays you some money for a bit.

ATOS sends a doctor out to assess the new condition.

The DWP decide that the new condition is not serious so they stop your DLA since ATOS only assessed the new condition.

You contact the DLA and explain that you now have the original condition plus the new one.

The DWP tell you they've reviewed your case the new condition means you are fit to work, having forgotten about the old condition.

You wait two years for a tribunal, the DWP only send half the paperwork and the judge has to adjorn the case for another six months.

You go back to court, the judge, doctor and care professional take ten minutes to decide that the DWP couldn't find their arse with their elbow.

Since for a number of kids this is what kept them away from higher education, since parents could not support them and some good unis are away from home. It felt like at the time the system worked in some way, you still had to study hard and prove attendance to get the grants.

Sadly, now the fees are bloated, it feels more like way to grab profits increase shares value for the Russell group.

Siggy is trickier, he is a fellow Icelander and I want one in the 1st team before I die and he would probably start ahead of Henderson, or at the very least give him some quality competition.

I work a 50-60 hour week, I start at 7 and I work till 6 normally.  Longer if something breaks or we are busy.  I spend about 10 hours a week just reading email.  So if I hired someone else to take some of my work, then the first 10 hours they would spend reading the same emails as me and for those *10 hours* worked they would not have saved me so much as 5 minutes.

Add to that that I am paid to take responsibility.  I know what is happening on our company servers all the time.  If someone else is working on them and they break something, they call me, if someone else needs to get on to change something, they come to me, I know how the whole thing works and I deal with the programmers so when they want to make some innocuous sounding change I flag up that it will actually break some age old work around.

That can't be delegated either.

So to cut time from my long work week, I need to find someone smart enough to do the job (not actually hard) but I also need to find someone who is detail orientated and pays attention (hard for me to do myself...) and that person needs to work 30 hours a week just to save me 10-15 hours and the first 6-12 months they work for us, they are really just learning everything I already know and so they are no real use.

It's not worth it.

I think you are exactly right about unemployment being caused by people like me, effectively working 2 jobs.  And I think this will cause serious social problems in the future.

CBT(Compulsory Basic Training) - you start out on a 125cc, learn the basics in a car park then if the instructor thinks you're confident enough you go for a ride out and about. All going well, your CBT takes about 4 hours.  
  
Module 1 - You get to learn on a bigger bike (600cc I think?), again starting in a car park (learning to control the bike around cones, etc) then another ride out and about.  
  
Before you take module 2 you need to pass your theory. If he passes module 2 he can ride any size motorbike. I've completely forgotten what's involved in module 2 (although he did get to practice for it after completing module 1 - there was still some time left in the lesson).

It actually cost the country and the treasury a lot of lost money, and another reason why noone trusts New Labour when it comes to economics.

That BR wants to do it a different way.

BR has stated clearly that the squad was strengthend and we need to reinforce the first team.

Since he made this statement we have added a loanee left back.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I received a reply from my MP, this was the same boilerplated response as from other MPs that others have posted and cited (i.e. copied from the DCMS strategy paper):

&gt;Thank you for contacting me about ISP level filtering.
 
&gt;Currently, 91 per cent of children live in households with internet access and a greater proportion of children aged 12-15 own smartphones than adults. While I am firmly of the opinion that consenting adults should always be free to watch the legal content they choose, children and young people are important consumers of digital content and their ability to access harmful and age inappropriate content should be limited as far as possible.
 
&gt;To help remedy this, the Government has been working through the UK Council for Child Internet Safety (UKCCIS) to pursue a voluntary approach to child internet safety and has called on industry to make the right tools available to allow parents to protect children online.
 
&gt;For instance, where children could be accessing the internet, we need good filters that are preselected to be on, and we need parents aware and engaged in the setting of those filters. It is this Government’s aim that by the end of this year, when someone sets up a new broadband account, the settings to install family friendly filters will be automatically selected; if you just click next or enter, then the filters are automatically on.
 
&gt;By the end of next year ISPs should also have prompted all existing customers to make an unavoidable decision about whether to apply family friendly filters. Only adult account holders will be able to change these filters once applied. All mobile phone operators will apply adult filters to their phones, and 90 per cent of public Wi-Fi will have family friendly filters applied to wherever children are likely to be present. Ofcom will regularly review the efficacy of these filters.
 
&gt;While this is good progress, the Government has been clear that industry must go further. We expect the smaller ISPs to follow the lead being set by the larger providers, and the industry must continue to refine and improve their filters to ensure they do not – even unintentionally – filter out legitimate content.
 
&gt;We also want to see mobile network operators develop their child safety services further; for example, filtering by handset rather than by contract would provide greater flexibility for parents as they work to keep their children safe online.
 
&gt;And while Government looks to the industry to deliver, through the self-regulatory mechanisms already established under UKCCIS, it is clear that if momentum is not maintained, it will consider whether alternative regulatory powers can deliver a culture of universally-available, family-friendly internet access that is easy to use.  At such a time, if it were under consideration then I would expect consultation to be sought from both key industry players, as well as the public.
 
&gt;I do hope that this information helps, and thank you again for contacting me about this important issue.

I have also written directly to the Dept for Culture, Media and Sport explaining my issues. Will post their response when I receive it.

Just because Greenwald worked for the Guardian does not make them the only source of credible info on this story at all. In fact it makes them very much a biased source  because one of their contractors is involved. How can you not see that?

There is evidence that points to the fact that Miranda was being used as a Mule to ferry documents through Heathrow on Greenwald's behalf. From the horses mouth himself (greenwald)

**From NYT**
Mr. Miranda was in Berlin to deliver documents related to Mr. Greenwald’s investigation into government surveillance to Ms. Poitras, **Mr. Greenwald said.** Ms. Poitras, in turn, gave Mr. Miranda different documents to pass to Mr. Greenwald. Those documents, which were stored on encrypted thumb drives, were confiscated by airport security, **Mr. Greenwald said.** All of the documents came from the trove of materials **provided** to the two journalists **by Mr. Snowden.** The British authorities seized all of his electronic media — including video games, DVDs and data storage devices — and did not return them, Mr. Greenwald said.*

What is unfortunate in this instance is that she doesn't seem to recognise that the US runs a few ""socialist"" programs.

People are not being pushed to study a vocational degree because they have to pay their loan back - if you started paying it back irrespective of what you earn, then yes, that would be a bad system. However, the repayment amounts are tiered with your income, so as you earn more, you repay more - so just as you'll never find yourself in a position where you cannot afford to pay your tax, you'll not be in a position where you cannot afford to pay your student loan repayment.

&gt;Suppose you do the history degree and then get a low paying job that's only just above the threshold to have to start paying back the debt, and you have a family to support? That's a scary enough possibility to put me off doing a history degree- let's all do an accountancy degree instead to avoid this possibility.

[Theresa May gets cross-party backing in Article 8 row][1] (19 June 2012) (BBC)
[1]: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18511727

&gt; Several leading barristers have questioned the need for new guidance, saying the meaning of Article 8 is already clear and judges understand it, but Home Secretary Theresa May says the judiciary itself has asked for parliament to make its views known.

&gt; Home Office sources say the government was not obliged to seek parliamentary approval for the changes it is proposing to the immigration rules.

&gt; But Mrs May said the government wanted ""to give a clear message to courts about how parliament believes Article 8 should be interpreted... the stronger the voice from parliament, the better the message will be.""

&gt; Following over four hours of debate, MPs unanimously accepted the government motion.

&gt; The home secretary said that if courts do not heed the message the government would ""look at other measures"".


[Theresa May criticises judges for 'ignoring' deportation law][2] (17 February 2013) (BBC)
[2]: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21489072

&gt; The home secretary, in her newspaper article, blamed judges who had ""got it into their heads that the ECHR Article Eight 'right to family life' could not be curbed"".

&gt; ""Unfortunately, some judges evidently do not regard a debate in Parliament on new immigration rules, followed by the unanimous adoption of those rules, as evidence that Parliament actually wants to see those new rules implemented,"" she wrote.

&gt; She noted that one judge had justified his decision on the basis that the new guidance had been subject only to ""a weak form of Parliamentary scrutiny"".

&gt; Mrs May went on: ""It is essential to democracy that the elected representatives of the people make the laws that govern this country - and not the judges.

&gt; ""Yet some judges seem to believe that they can ignore Parliament's wishes if they think that the procedures for parliamentary scrutiny have been 'weak'. That appears actually to mean that they can ignore Parliament when they think it came to the wrong conclusion.""

[3]: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/9875861/Iain-Duncan-Smith-judges-should-enforce-new-deportation-rules.html

May continued:

&gt; “It’s not in the national interest that this situation continues.” 

&gt; “That appears actually to mean that they can ignore Parliament when they think it came to the wrong conclusion,” Mrs May wrote.

&gt; Judges who have “got it into their heads” that the right to family life was “an absolute, unqualified, right” were “wrong”, but still able to frustrate Government policy by preventing the deportation of criminals, she added.

&gt; Passing new legislation will take time, Mrs May wrote, and the delays mean “many more” foreign criminals will avoid deportation, leading to more victims of violent crimes in Britain.

&gt; ""It is regrettable that the Secretary of State's officials decided to refuse their own undertaking,"" said a spokesperson for Duncan Lewis who brought the case. ""We note from their own evidence that this decision was taken after 'senior [UK Border Agency] personnel were consulted.

&gt; ""We firmly support the decision of the judge. Undertakings are a vital part of the machinery of litigation and save all parties and the Court from the need to exhaustively litigate every last issue. We believe that the finding that the refusal to honour the undertaking was Contempt of Court was in part designed to ensure that there is no future repetition of this conduct on their part.

&gt; “We also consider it likely that the Home Secretary's intemperate comments about the Human Rights Act and the perceived failings of the judiciary gave rise to a culture within UKBA in which her officials failed to abide by the rule of law. The instant case is only one, albeit the most serious, example of this behaviour on their part.

I doubt anyone in all seriousness would argue that higher education is not a useful thing to fund. Though the debate will quickly centre of who should pay the bill.

Let's dissect this a bit further:

1. It is reasonable that the state should help those from poor backgrounds who have demonstrated academic potential to be successful at university but do not have the means to attend.

2. If we wish to increase the numbers of people attending higher education courses then we need to ensure that it does not come at the cost of quality. The UK is one of two countries that is not the USA with world class universities. Quantity is no replacement for quality.

3. Subsidising middle-higher class kids to play around at university studying fine art and philosophy is not necessarily the best investment for the State or society. Yes, these courses have value but given the anecdotal stories we hear of media students lumping it in McD's but let's refocus on demand from employers rather than demand from students. Or at least if students wish to fund an interest they can do it on their own budget.

Regarding Scots:
&gt; The Scots who live towards the south are much better-mannered, and, being more civilized, use the English language
&gt; They are also strong in intellect, as their learning goes to show. For they easily progress in any art to which they apply themselves. But for those of them given to idleness, laziness and sloth, they, avoiding work, boast of their nobility even in the midst of extreme positive, as if it were more honorable for a wellborn man to be poor than seek to support himself by any livelihood. And in general the Scots are accounted pious in their religion. 

Welsh: 

&gt; The Welsh derive their ancestry from the Trojans, and claim that their language is partly made of Trojan, and partly of ancient Greek. But, whatever it may, be the Welsh do not pronounce their language as sweetly and softly as do the English, because the former, I believe, speak more in the throat, whereas the latter properly imitate the Latins in speaking only a little between the lips, which produces a pleasant sweet for listeners. 

English:

&gt; Englishmen are tall, with handsome open faces, grey-eyed for the most part. And just as they are very similar to the Italians in the sound of their language, so the build of their bodies and their manners do not greatly differ from theirs. They have fine manners, they take counsel with deliberation (since they know that nothing is as inimical to counsel as haste), they are gentle and inclined by nature to every act of kindness.

&gt; A union has criticised a firm for ""bussing"" inmates from a Monmouthshire prison and paying them £3 a day at its call centre.

&gt; Unite accused Cardiff solar panel firm Becoming Green of ""Dickensian"" exploitation.

&gt; Both the Prison Service and the firm denied claims workers lost jobs to make way for inmates from HMP Prescoed.

&gt; Becoming Green also said a ""significant amount"" of wages went to victim support.

&gt; It said it was ""proud"" to support prisoners' rehabilitation.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; TV's give off emissions that are detectable.

The TV's tuner does. If you believe the fluff from the BBC when analogue TV was in use, they could detect what channel the TV's tuner was tuned to. 

In the age of digital TVs this doesn't seem as feasible - especially since you don't actually need a TV licence to use a freeview or satellite box with a hi-fi to receive radio stations. Any detector equipment, if it exists (and this is not totally proven), wouldn't be able to detect what specific service the box is tuned to. I'd be impressed if said equipment is able to work with satellite too.

&gt; Streaming online to a computer can be detected with a request from the ISP.

Assuming that the ISP keeps records. If they were to retain records of the websites you visit, they would see that you visit (e.g.) the iPlayer and the page for a live stream. It wouldn't prove that you started watching the stream. With the way things are going, perhaps TV Licensing has a direct feed from GCHQ? There is no evidence to suggest that TV Licensing is allowed to obtain records from ISPs.

There are other loopholes too, like using 3G/4G dongles on a battery powered machine, or shared accomodation where each room technically needs a licence but shares a common internet connection. Can't really prove which computer was doing what.

In practice TV Licensing's main way of enforcement is scary letters based on a comparison of all the addresses in Britain to that of the addresses of every premises with a licence - those that don't have a licence get scary letters and salesmen that lie and spin their way into your house where you'll hopefully incriminate yourself.",0,1377083838,null,0,1377084621,0,cbs7ma4,t3_1ksojc,t1_cbs7ma4,t1_cbs7jdv,null,1429753397,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

Edit because I'm obviously not being very clear. Rather than a prisoner doing nothing, they could opt to work a job, where they are paid a wage. From this wage they are then expected to pay for their living, as you do on the outside, but somehow creating a system on the inside where there is variation in what your outgoings are. As the prisoner budgets for expenses and so on, they would be able to have made a little money for the work they have done. If they work well, turn up on time etc this can be rewarded with bonuses.

See, here's the thing. The enforcement system relies, in large part, on assumption. Most people watch TV. It's a fair guess that you (the hypothetical you) does. So that's how they start: from the principle that a) you don't have a licence (because licences are for addresses, not people) and b) you watch TV. 

What follows is a fairly complex direct mail campaign. In fact, AFAIK it's the largest direct mail initiative in the UK. They have to take into account people who've moved to the UK but have never heard of TV licensing, or students who've never had to have one before, or any number of other permutations. 

I assume that yes, if you've supplied your name it's now linked to that address. But they'll continue to check, as I said, because people move.

He will contribute greatly against the likes of Christian Benteke, but more importantly, Andreas Weimann and Gabriel Agbonlahor. Next to Ramires I'd like Frank Lampard to help spray passes over the pitch, as it's obvious that we'll control the possession and his presence would be fantastic against a pinned-down-and-waiting-for-the-counter Aston Villa side. Villa's main man is Christian Benteke, a very strong and pacey striker who could create trouble for a slow John Terry, so I'd put in Ivanovic next to Gary Cahill in the center, and play Azpilicueta who is really fast and will be great for tracking back against Agbonlahor when they're on the counter.

The attacking midfielders should be Mazacar with Mata on the right (As Mourinho has stated he will assign him to), Oscar in the number 10 drifting in all directions and Eddie Hazard on the left. 

Striker should be Lukaku starting as it would only be fair since Torres got the start against Hull. Hopefully Ba would get some minutes too.

Sturridge will be great this season, we all anticipate that. Suarez will come back as hungry as ever and score another 20+ (if we keep him through January, which I anticipate as well.) 

Countinho and Aspas will surely rack up quite a number of assists, but we all feel we need one more first-choice attacking player. Question is: do we get another creator or a lethal front man? It seems we're going for the best players available in either mold, which makes sense considering Suarez (most likely) has one season left with us, at best. It may two players to replace what Luis brings to the team, and if we could get one of those this windows I, personally, will be much more comfortable going forward.

true,My_Thoughts,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"I stopped paying for a couple few reasons.  I used to watch BBC news, but over time the coverage became more and more light and fluffy, and more celebrity focused.  When overseas I found the BBC international coverage far better but that's blocked to people in the UK. (Yes I know it takes 15 seconds to get around that) but my point is the news they produce for outside the UK is far better than what we get.

The other reason I stopped paying is the way they report Scotland.   The BBC is not fair, nor are they balanced about Scotland.  On the recent newsnight with the SNP, they invited UKIP and George fucking Galloway (neither of which have any support in Scotland) onto the show but noone from the other Scottish parties who support a yes vote.

These days I can far better news shows online that the domestic BBC offerings, and apart from Dr Who, which I am about 2 seasons behind in I just dont watch anything else they offer.

As with torrents you'd get similar problems - how can you prove that the IP address and user that it is linked to is actually the person and address where the stream is being watched? 

Another interesting point: I have a VPN setup here so that I can connect in and my internet traffic then goes through my home network and my internet connection here. If the BBC were to keep records while I was using it on iPlayer, they'd see that someone with my IP (and my address) is trying to watch something live.

I do have a licence here, but what if I didn't, and the place I was actually decoding the stream at did have a licence? Would that be illegal? It'd be very hard for the BBC to figure that out, and not in any way worth it.

The flat market in Edinburgh is honestly a little weird, and you can sometimes find a 2 bedroom flat for the same price as a 1 bedroom flat that is 2 streets over.

I've lived in Leith for the last 18 months and love it, I'm in the middle of Leith walk near MacDonald Street and it's lovely. Great bus links too.

I'd also echo going private. Our first letting agent was Rettie, and they charged us £90 to replace a toilet seat on our leaving inspection, £20 for the seat and £70, yes, £70, for labour. They were fine while we were tenants but they fucked us around with the deposit.

We've since gone with James Gibbs, and they're frankly useless. They're a massive umbrella agent and I doubt they'd be able to find their own arse with 2 hands, a flashlight and a map, let alone manage a property for you. For example, the carpets in our flat are a bit run down, we were told they'd be replaced before we moved in as there was a month's wait till we entered the flat. We've now been in the flat for 2 months, and we've still got the same carpet. It took us 2 months of asking just to get the inventory for the property.

So yeah, try and find a private landlord or flat share would be my recommendation. Gumtree is where I found my first place in Edinburgh, but I've used Spareroom too before.

true,Thisisunicorn,null,null,"Broadly, I'm in agreement, particularly on points 3, 4 and 6. On point 4, I think the problem was that they gave Matt Smith a hard job in being accepted as the new Doctor, when there was such a strong sense of cut-off between him and David Tennant. They did, as people have said in the comments, begin to make more references to the Doctor's earlier life, but by that point the damage was done. I was expecting at least a passing reference at some point to 10's fear of being erased upon regeneration not having happened: ""that wasn't so bad"", or something. But it felt like exactly what 10 feared happened: he was forgotten. 11 felt like a different person. I understand that, as naturally_attractive said, distancing himself from his past is sort of part of 11's character, but they took too long to establish any connection whatever from 10 - 11.

I sort of disagree with point 9. It's not a lack of subtlety that's the problem: Moffat merely prefers to have an outright plot arc through his seasons, where Davies preferred standalone episodes with references here and there that set up the drama of the season finale. The problem is that Moffat can't quite commit to a full arc, and many of the episodes are standalone. This has the effect of making those episodes feel a bit pointless, because one's constantly waiting for the arc to continue, which it only does every second or third episode. In the Davies era, one didn't have to wait because there was nothing to wait for. None of the episodes ""counted"" anymore than any of the others. I also think that this problem has become more pronounced over time: Matt Smith's first season, in this regard, was a good balance between the two styles.",0,1377090576,null,0,false,0,cbs8ya2,t3_1kql4g,t1_cbs8ya2,t3_1kql4g,null,1429752775,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

I think the term 'loan' has instant negative connotations and the media love headlines like '22 year olds come out with £40,000 of debt and can't find a job!' - I guess ignorance about the reality of the loan terms causes people to get offended by the suggestion that little Jimmy will come out of university with a £40k deficit to his name before he's even started his career.

&gt;So do you reckon we should just welcome fee paying university education? 

Well, that is a difficult one. I personally would be happy to pay higher tax in order to fund free university education, despite having an outstanding loan. But I can appreciate why people wouldn't be happy to contribute in order to pay for something they have not had the opportunity to access for reasons other than financial.

You're missing my point - no additional employment would have been created as a result - and that is the point I was attacking in the original comment.

The improvement on the unemployment figures would be precisely 0%.

So, she's written two agitprop / polemic books aimed squarely at those true believers seeking to be propagandized to. And her claim to fame is that: 1) she went to school with someone and 2) she was one of a cadre of speech writers for Nancy Reagan (the wife of former president Ronald Reagan) while she was first lady.  I need to point out that as first lady Nancy Reagan was decidedly non-political and uninvolved. Moreover, my recollection is that Mrs. Reagan has never made any speech pertaining to serious national public policies.

Therefore my take on this is that a second rate propagandist cum pundit went to Scotland and applied the common and deliberately deceptive concept of ""everything I don't like or which might possibly be to the political left of my personal, beyond the fringe, extreme right-wing stance is *socialism*"" to her visit.

Agreed.

I fully predict also that because the government are loudly saying ""Students 'must pay back loans sooner'"" for university fees, that all interest rates on all student loans will be raised.

[Students 'must pay back loans sooner'][1] (13 June 2013) (Telegraph)
[1]: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/10119622/Students-must-pay-back-loans-sooner.html

 In 2011/12, the Government’s Student Loans Company paid out £5.6 billion in loans and grants and £3.1 billion in tuition fees.

&gt; Mr Cable’s officials estimate that the State will eventually have to write off around 34 per cent of all the money it lends, because graduates will fall short of the repayment threshold.

&gt; The Treasury is said to question that estimate, suggesting that as much as 40 per cent of all money lent could be lost.

&gt; The final costs of the new student loan system to taxpayers is not yet clear, because those costs will be borne over several decades as graduates’ careers progress.

&gt; But even a small reduction in the proportion of the loans that are written off could reduce the annual costs to the Government by hundreds of millions of pounds.

[2]: http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2013/jun/17/rothschild-report-student-loans-risks?CMP=twt_gu

&gt; Vince Cable and David Willetts have a fundamental problem, as they have yet to settle with the Treasury over their share of austerity in the present comprehensive spending review. The student loans scheme that was rushed through in 2010 is widely recognised to be fiscally unsustainable. The resource accounting and budgeting charge (the percentage of loans that will never be paid back) is estimated by the Institute for Public Policy Research to stand at 39.4%, creating a considerable black hole in the deficit reduction programme.

&gt; The government's higher education policies have seriously damaged student take up of degree places, indebted future generations, caused chaos in universities, irreparably undermined trust in the coalition government, and added to the national debt. As the election approaches and a sale of public assets looks a likely option for a cash-strapped government, something has to give with student loans.

true,Swederman,FR,france,"&gt; I then go away and work out the total for each player for the game. As an example, in the Hull City game that has just played, Oscar received 31 x 3 points, 9 x 2 points and 4 x 1 points which gives him a total of 115 points. Following the same rules, De Bruyne received a total of 56 points and Lampard received 43. Following that was Hazard (34), Ramires (31), etc. Now, I take the top 3 with the most points and give them the 3, 2 or 1 points respectively for that game. So for Hull City, Oscar got 3, De Bruyne got 2 and Lampard got 1. No other points are given out.

So what happens to the points total for eacher player after a game? Do you still count it and update it but only display the top 3 or is it discarded completely after getting the top 3?

Good job by the way.

Paying large amounts of money doesn't always equal a great player. If we were in a bidding war with Spurs for Aspas and bought him for 20 million, I guess the mood here would have been a lot different. I'm glad the owners have learnt from their mistakes and are refusing to pay more than a player is worth.

Transfers are always a gamble. Pay a you Play, a book written by Paul Tomkins did an analysis of transfers and found that roughly 50% of transfers can be deemed a success.

The BBC certainly does get support in the sense that it's the country's best-known and most respected news and programming source. It's in the interests of politicians to appear on it, for example, but then that cuts both ways. Can you articulate how else it gets support? I suspect you mean more tangible means but I don't want to assume. 

And your attitude at the end of your comment is, to me, needlessly confrontational. The fact that the licence fee is part of the law is something the government could change, frankly, if it wanted to. I'm sure the current administration would like nothing better. But there's nothing ""streetwise"" about knowing one's rights, however much it might suit your shitty little tone of voice to say so. We live in an era where information is more freely available than at any other time in history. The instrument for its retrieval is the same one you're sitting at at the moment. 

As for the ""vulnerable"", perhaps you could be a little more specific about that. My understanding is that pensioners and the disabled get concessions or, in the case of the elderly, free licences.

&gt; ""I cannot say anything about that but it is not true.""
&gt; 
&gt; 3:19 pm
&gt; BALE KLAXON!
&gt; 
&gt; AVB is asked if the new signings are to play alongside Gareth Bale - or replace him. He gives a non-answer which hints strongly the Welshman is on his way:
&gt; 
&gt; ""Ideally we want to keep everyone. Anything can happen.
&gt; 
&gt; ""We are in the last few days of transfer activity.
&gt; 
&gt; ""The objective is always to be stronger than the year before and I think we are on the right way to achieve it.""
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 3:16 pm
&gt; AVB is asked again about Willian - and the contribution of technical director Franco Baldini:
&gt; 
&gt; ""I can't really confirm anything regarding Willian. There is interest in the player and there have been conversations.
&gt; 
&gt; Franco is a massive appointment for Tottenham. Someone I wanted last year and it wasn't possible then.
&gt; 
&gt; ""He has massive experience Real Madrid, Roma and the FA. He is one of the best technical directors there is.""
&gt; 
&gt; 3:13 pm
&gt; Neil McLeman
&gt; AVB is asked about the possible signings of Willian, Erik Lamela and Fabio Coentrao.
&gt; 
&gt; He said: ""None of the names you have mentioned have signed for Spurs. I have answered about Willian in the past - not only time with Tottenham but also Chelsea.
&gt; 
&gt; ""All the players are great, great players.
&gt; 
&gt; ""On the players that are here, we are moving forward. We are not only trimming the squad but adding tremendous talent.
&gt; 
&gt; ""I think we can become very, very strong regards to last season. It depends what deals we are able to conclude before the end of the market. We are looking to be stronger than before.""

true,rydleo,null,null,"Man, I would love you to submit this under it's own entry as I think it would make for an interesting debate/conversation on it's own right.  I don't necessarily agree with all of your points, but many I do. 

1.  A DoF I think would have been a good thing from the very beginning, but someone actually competent.  Txiki Begiristain was a name mentioned for that sort of position at one point as well as other (I seem to recall Van Gaal as well?  Was a while back now and my memory is fuzzy.)  Most major clubs have similar continental setups these days and for me I wouldn't have minded something similar either- it makes changes in the managerial positions much less risky (see Chelsea) as they become simply employees like the players and can provide a greater degree of stability long term.  So on this, I agree it wouldn't have been a bad thing, depending on who the hypothetical DoF is.

2.  I think Ayre is okay as commercial director and he's done a reasonable job given the constraints he's operating under (lack of CL and a likely declining fan base).  That said, a new one wouldn't bother me much either.

3.  The website is pretty awful.  I still can't get past the first page on my phone.

4.  On this one, I almost think we actually need a transfer budget as my understanding there really is no set budget to begin with.  This sounds fine, but I imagine it's time consuming and onerous, which can create responsiveness issues.

5.  And this one is where we are going to disagree.  I like what the club are doing in replacing the expensive players we've acquired over the past few managers with younger, hungrier ones with something to prove.  Since the formation of the transfer committee, all the signings have been very good value for money in my opinion, certainly the best I recall seeing in years.  I also like seeing the youth from the academy actually get a crack at the first team.  I would have no problem keeping down this path even if it takes years to crack back into the CL.  To be honest, I expect England may well lose it's 4th place berth in the CL anyway in a few years which is going to make things very interesting for us, Spurs, and Arsenal.

**Does that count as 'television receiver' under s368 of the Act?**

    368 Meanings of “television receiver” and “use”
    
    (1)In this Part “television receiver” means any apparatus of a description specified in regulations [...].

    (3)References in this Part to using a television receiver are references to using it for receiving television programmes.

**What do the regulations say?**

(*The Communications (Television Licensing) Regulations 2004*)
 
    “television receiver” means any apparatus installed or used for the purpose of receiving (whether by means of wireless telegraphy or otherwise) any television programme service

**television programme service** 
    
    s362 Interpretation 

    ""television programme service” means any of the following
    (a) a television broadcasting service;
    [...]
    (d) a restricted television service;

    “television broadcasting service” means a service which—
    (a) consists in a service of television programmes provided with a view to its being broadcast (whether in digital or in analogue form);
    (b) is provided so as to be available for reception by members of the public; and
    (c) is not—
    (c)(i) a restricted television service;
    (iv) a service provided under the authority of a licence under Part 1 of the 1996 Act to provide a digital television programme service;

    “restricted television service” means any restricted service within the meaning given by section 42A of the Broadcasting Act 1990 (a service which consists in the broadcasting of television programmes for a particular establishment or a particular event);

    “digital programme service” means a service consisting in the provision [...] of television programmes with a view to their being broadcast in digital form for general reception, but does not include—
    (c) any service whose visual images to be broadcast do not consist wholly or mainly of images capable of being seen as moving pictures, except to the extent that it is an ancillary service.
    
    “television programme” means any programme (with or without sounds) which—
(a) is produced wholly or partly to be seen on television; and
(b) consists of moving or still images or of legible text or of a combination of those things;

The answer is still unclear. A 'television programme' must include pictures. My radio doesn't receive the pictures, but the audio feed is arguably part of the programme. Does it  receive 'the service' if it receives part of  'the service'?

I think the explanation completely fits with the other rules set up in the episode, and in Doctor Who as a whole: once you read about the future that someone wrote about as their past, and act on that knowledge, it creates a paradox in that your actions would cause the person never to have written it, and therefore for you to act on it. When Amy saw Rory's name on the gravestone, going back to alter history to prevent Rory from dying would have meant she never saw his name on the gravestone, which means she never would have gone back to save him. The same is true for the Doctor once Amy got zapped away. This type of meddling with time holds true in other episodes too, like Father's Day for example in Series One.

true,roontish12,dalek,Dalek,"The early episodes can be tough to get through and make it seem like the show isn't that good. What I'd suggest is to jump around a bit. Watch some of the highly praised episodes. The great thing about Doctor Who is that it doesn't *necessarily* need to be watched in order. Also keep in mind that for each different Doctor the episodes and stories are very different. Tennent's episodes are different from Eccelsonts, and Smiths different from both of them.

Some of my favorites:

**Season 1**:

Dalek

The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances (2 parter)

**Season 2**:

The Girl In the Fireplace

**Season 3**: 

Smith and Jones

Human Nature/Family of Blood (2 parter)

42

BLINK!!! (many peoples favorite episode ever)

**Season 4:**

Silence on the Library/Forest of the Dead (2 parter)

Midnight

Note: Please also be sure to check out The Waters of Mars, which is a David Tennent ""Special"". It's longer than an episode, but not quite a movie, but it is FANTASTIC, and IMO a story that can give you exactly what Doctor Who is about and how it's done. It's one of the best stories of the entire series. 

**Season 5:**

Victory of the Daleks

Amy's Choice

Vincent and the Doctor (my favorite episode ever)

**Season 6:**

The Doctors Wife

secondly, how's her pension ? if there's only a state one, i'd seriously do some consideration to see if thats enough for her. £145 a week which my mum gets atm is not a lot of money. here's a calc for working out state pension - https://www.gov.uk/calculate-state-pension



If she has a private one, using a pension calc to work out how much she'd get and what difference putting a lump sum would make is worth considering. There's a good calc here : https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/pension-calculator that will show you the different effects.



So, thats debt, pension, potentially housing sorted, which i would tackle before anything else.



After that I would then think about investing it. 



So, the isa is tax free, your current account isnt. Therefore, the isa is actually better return because its tax free so  - so get the max amount in there first. A stocks and shares isa should also allow you to put in about 11k on top, and returns on it up to a certain amount are also tax free. Speak to a few different banks or some indepedant financial advisors about what products are out there. I also wouldnt take a 2 year fixed isa - i'd take a 1 year and swap it for a better interest rate on the 1st of april next year when new isas are launched. 



I wouldnt keep 20k in a current account unless you are really risk-averse. You can get 5-10% from peer to peer lending and many of them have risk reduction/compensation plans so you can still get a good return if people dont pay back. There are risks - read http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/savings/peer-to-peer-lending fully before doing it. And dont put all of it in this, at most i'd put 50% of whatever is left at this point because spreading your risk across different things helps reduce it , even if it lowers your returns.



For the rest of it i'd get it invested, now hargreaves landsdown and other brokers are basically self managed. That's great if you know what you aer doing, but if you dont know about investing can be really confusing and there's a good chance you'd lose your money.  I'd suggest that it'd be better for you to have a managed fund that someone else handles for you.



When i did it was a managed stocks and shares isa which had a fairly decent return - i'd recommend spending to some financial advisors about those and seeing what options are out there - its less risky than managing it yourself, but also will likely have a lower return.



edit : i realise this doesnt cover your 'reasonable about available easily' - thats a very subjective statement. How much is reasonable, and how easy is easy ? you can get 30 day access on some things, during which time you could cover expenses with a credit card and you'd pay no interest if you paid it back when you got the money out within 30 days.

You could try /r/UKInvesting for advice on investments, but really you shouldn't take too much stock of advice from strangers over the net. It's also not the most active.

I think the problem is that secure investments that are easily accessible as well as good returns and low effort would be the holy grail. The only thing I can think of is a really small buy-to-let. Then again, I'm still at step 2 - so I have 0 idea about investment.

I actually think Lewis has decided now was the time to spend and fuck over LFC and Arsenal, get in the CL and start building a squad to win trophies. I think we'll spend on willian, lamela and maybe a CB and end up with a big net spend, partially negated by the TV money, but still out of character for the club. Then Bale will go and everyone will say they were spending the bale money early, until next summer we actually spend the Bale money once we are in the CL and can attract even more top players. In theory we stay in the CL, and challenge for the title.

Yohan Mollo has been known as something of an unpredictable winger throughout his career, which started with Monaco – where he was known as the ‘Ronaldo of the Rock’ – and has progressed to Nancy via loan spells at Caen and Granada. At 24 years old he has started to mature and become more consistent, as best displayed by during another loan spell with Saint-Etienne at the end of last season that came about due to the Lorraine outfit’s financial struggles.

With Sainté last season he played an important role as they claimed the Coupe de la Ligue and was an important foil to Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang as Christophe Galtier’s side finished the season in impressive style. Saint-Etienne wanted to keep the quick and direct wideman in their roster for this term but they were priced out of the market while Marseille also had an interest.

Mollo was an improving force in Le Championnat last term. He scored a career-high seven league goals last season but assists are his meat and drink. The Martigues-born attacker got 11 of these in Ligue 1 in the previous campaign, and this improved cutting edge in the final third is what has had clubs excited this summer.",0,1377099335,null,0,false,0,cbsbesm,t3_1kt51y,t1_cbsbesm,t3_1kt51y,null,1429751629,1,false,crystalpalace,t5_2tqdj,1

My thinking is that right now every position in the team has at least two players fighting for it. But if you add Willian, we're one too heavy in attacking midfield/wings. Especially since our wingers/CAMs are meant to be interchangeable and able to play anywhere across the line.

&gt;Born at Hartlepool, County Durham he attained notoriety in 1984 when he was convicted of three murders committed in Dore, Sheffield, South Yorkshire, on 23 October 1983. He murdered Basil Laitner (aged 59), his 55-year-old wife Avril, and their 28-year-old son Richard. He raped their 18-year-old daughter Nicola at knife-point before fleeing. Just hours earlier, the family had hosted the wedding reception of their other daughter Suzanne at the house. It is believed that he was planning to commit an armed robbery at the house.[1]

&gt;Hutchinson was also wanted for a rape at the time, and had already spent more than five years in prison for the attempted murder of his brother-in-law. His identity was established by the description given by Nicola, and by forensic evidence in the form of a palm-print left on a champagne glass.[2] After spending weeks on the run, wearing disguises and moving from place to place in Barnsley, Nottinghamshire, Manchester, York, and Scarborough, he was finally captured on a farm in Hartlepool.[1]
He was found guilty of all three murders and the rape on 14 September 1984.

They allocate around half, or maybe 40% of the tickets to coporate sponsors then the other 60 odd % gets split evenly between the two teams. That means only 30% capacity per team, and I think they distribute the tickets based on a loyalty points system (I may be wrong here but thats how the tickets for big games are allocated at the Bridge) So basically the more games you've been to the better chance you stand of getting a ticket.

But there is hope, so many tickets to the final get given to the sponsors that they are the ones you can buy through non conventional ways. But they cost an arm and a leg easily in a excess of £1000. So to be honest it's a tough thing to achieve to get tickets for the final, you have a much better chance of getting a ticket to one of the group games at the bridge or abroad.

In saying that, I think City well overpaid for Fernandinho and Dortmund's competition in Liverpool drove Mkhitaryan up from a probably more accurate £22m. If I had to value Willian I would but him in the £26m to £28m range. Somewhere between Paulinho and Modric. 

Considering spurs had to outbid Liverpool I can see how the price got driven up to £30m and I imagine Levy would have preferred holding off to deadline day and then taking Willian off of Anzhi's hands for £25m.

The player is young and will be a good player for another 5 years or so, £30m over 5 years isn't bad at all.

While the math in this article is imprecise, the wholly black and white view that Spurs have spent £60 million outright with the potential to spend £100+ million is very short sighted and the suggestion that we'd NEED to sell Bale to avoid being £100+ million in the red is absurd. That isn't just uncharacteristic spending, it's also flat out uncharacteristically bad business.

Now that could have been the difference in CL or 5th.

Obviously anything can happen and we have a much deeper squad this year to cope but for me Europa should be a opportunity to give the fringe players and youngsters a chance to shine. For me I would use the same tactics and formation we use in league games but substitute the players, this would enable players like Holtby and Capoue to slot in when needed in the league, knowing the system and their role better. 

For example....Brad, Naughton, Dawson, Fyers, Rose, Carroll, Capoue, Holtby, Sig, Townsend, Defoe, Kane etc.. I think these players should be good enough to get out of the group and then maybe integrate some first teamers into the team for the knockouts.

Yes. You have a legal requirement to buy a licence to receive live TV broadcasts whether through cable, over the air, satellite, or internet. This is used to fund the BBC.  If you have cable, or a subscription satellite service then you pay a subscription fee in addition to this.

&gt;  And folks come around inspecting to see if you have a TV?

Yes. It's subcontracted to a private company though so their powers are limited.

&gt; And if you have a TV, the enforceable assumption is that you use it?

It's a piece of evidence. The TV licensing company will initiate a private prosecution. Ownership of a TV will be used against you. If you only use it for DVDs or games then you don't need a licence.

1. River learning the Doctor's name:
Of course, I don't think we would watch River learn this (unless it happens in a flashback of sorts), because we aren't supposed to know his name. Also, we know that the Doctor visits River often and breaks her out of prison to see her. We also know that when she is working on being free the Doctor saw her shortly before she met 10. Therefore, we don't see all the adventures River has with the Doctor, but there are the minisodes.

2. The Silence:
As we know history can be changed, but even before 11 did this and even 10 in The Waters of Mars, we learn this with 9 when he goes back to Satellite 5 and remarks that the growth of society is completely wrong to what it is supposed to be.

3. Jenny:
She can come back. Haha, I just feel like this was a dropped plot line, but not that it means she went on to live a boring life. Who knows, maybe 12 will bump into her if Moffat decides to bring back characters and ideas from former Doctors.

4. The Gamma Forest and Lorna:
I already mentioned this in a comment below but to restate this: The Doctor meets people out of order all the time, it's possible that he just hadn't met young Lorna yet, because we don't see all his adventures. This is especially clear with Matt Smith and his age changing so drastically from the age change between 9 and 10.

5. Season 7 Out of Order:
I think it's possible, since things do seem a little strange and muddled, but unless stated I don't think it's really something that is unanswered and confusing, I never thought about that when watching.

6. Jack Harkness:

true,Twirrim,sussex,Sussex,"The real problems?

That the entire system is based on the idea that someone capable will be a popular, people person.  How many brilliant accountants, economists, scientists etc. does that stop?  That's not saying extroverts are incapable, but when you effectively knock out a sizeable chunk of the population that are introverts entirely... are you really getting the right people in a position to make decisions?

That decision making across a broad spectrum of knowledge domains should be handled by these popular individuals, leaving them reliant on either their own incompetence in the domain, or on special interest advisors (see climate change denial, diabolically bad technology bills etc.)
Worse still, we seem compound that by celebrating stupidity, revelling in our ignorance.

We don't vote people into the position of ""Chancellor of the Exchequer"".  We vote in someone to represent us in our region, and then leave it up to the PM to figure out which out of his closest friends he likes and things won't cause him problems (so it's not even necessarily the most capable out of the already likely bad set of people elected anyway)

That being a politician is a career, and thus that it's necessary to choose to do things based on likelihood of re-election rather than because they're the right things to do.
That comes down to two things: money &amp; popular opinion.
People en-mass are idiots, trying to slavishly follow public opinion that's necessary to be re-elected just means you're following the whims of idiots and those that manipulate them (media, charismatics etc.)  If you want to see the perfect extremes of this, look at the US political system.  House and Congress are re-elected every two years.  Meaning within 6 months they're focussing on getting re-elected.  You can see the change in Obama's stated goals between first election to presidency and the second.  As soon as his second and final term as President started, out came the 'unpopular' hard-nose talk about climate change and a few other topics.  None of which he could focus on with the need for re-election being important, even with 4 years between elections.

At least in the UK system politicians can get away with choosing less popular options for a year or so.
The need for money to fund election campaigns and lifestyle means the whims of those with money rate higher than those without.

The incentives for the political system are screwed up (and are in every democracy world wide).  The incentives should be what is good for the country and the people as a whole, but financially it's better off for them to do whatever gets them re-elected or gets them lobbying or consulting positions afterwards.

So let's say the UK changes its voting system.  Who will be elected?  Still someone popular.  A charismatic of some description.  They might be Green, or Lib Dem, UKIP, or some other new party that *might* spring up, but it will still essentially be the same types of people we've been voting in all along.  They'll still have the same underlying problems and ultimately the wrong motivations.",0,1377104376,null,0,false,0,cbsdemi,t3_1ksmr8,t1_cbsdemi,t1_cbsbh61,null,1429750698,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

I think we have too many deep CMs for plan A to be rotating them in a 4231 all the time. AVB's spoken about having two players for every position, and if the idea is to play Willian centrally that gives us 7 central players for 3 positions and 3 wide players for 2 positions (always assuming Bale goes at this point). And that's without considering Carroll.

So it makes more sense to me to assume we intend to use Willian as an inside forward most of the time.

Unless the rumours we're gonna ship Sigurdsson out are true, but I don't think that's likely, and if it happened we'd actually need to sign another winger rather than someone like Lamela being something of a luxury whose arrival would see Townsend leave.",0,1377105491,null,0,1377105829,0,cbsdunk,t3_1kt700,t1_cbsdunk,t1_cbscfiq,null,1429750489,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Firstly, do we need a 'marquee' signing? Perhaps, perhaps not. Coutinho gets injured. Lucas is out for 3 months. Sturridge has a few weeks off here, a few weeks off with a recurring niggle. And then what? 

Yes, our first team is very nice, as the game against Stoke showed. But one or two key players get injured, and we're still left fairly toothless, although perhaps less so than last season.

My second point is slightly different. I would not mind if the line from the club was ""we are looking to get in a player or two in before the end of the window, to strengthen the squad"". But that's not what they said. They talked about big, exciting signings that would slot right into the first team. They said they would bring in 'marquee' signings. 

They haven't and this is what worries me and where, I think, fans do have the right to feel aggrieved.

It's their term for the Computational Neuroscience program really, so essentially using computers to simulate the brain.

The purpose is two-fold:

1. By simulating the brain we can better understand neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's, autism etc. and it can also aid the design of neural prostheses such as the cochlear and retinal implants and brain-machine interfaces.

2. By simulating the brain we can improve our computational techniques as we can learn how it is that the brain performs such complex tasks such as visual processing or general intelligence far easier than computers can and mimic this in computer systems. Indeed the field of neuromorphic hardware is entirely devoted to creating computer hardware that mimics brain structure in the hope that it will perform better at those tasks.


So yeah it seems pretty cool - it'll probably mostly be swearing at computer code though, like most science these days :P

If you have a vague section that needs little to no reason when detaining someone, interpretation is irrelevant. 

Talking about interpretation implies there are some cases where it would be inappropriate to use it and some where it would be OK but if you need no reason to detain someone then how do you tell which cases are inappropriate and which are not? Inappropriate uses are those used for wrong or invalid reasons but if you don't need a reason then cases can't be inappropriate.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt; redistribution mechanism so measuring the worth of taxes by what you get back will mislead you

It is worse than that.  I did a straw poll the other day of people I know from college and uni we are all the same age +/- 2 years.  We should all damn well have pensions and other such savings.  One other friend did.  One.   This was from about 20 people I was asking.

I now know that any money I do save will be taken to be re-distributed amongst these guys.  Because ultimately someone is going to have to pay for them, people can't work until they drop dead.

The result?   I am not paying nearly half as much in to my pension as I was before.

Taxation or even just the fear of it changes human behaviour.  Why should I be frugal when those around me are not, and I know I will be punished.

&gt; You should measure it's worth by how successfully it does the jobs we have given the government to use it for. 

Plenty of which I think they do utterly terribly.

The thing is I am not given a choice, unless you know I earn utterly shitloads and get all those lovely non-dom options!  I actually made a spread sheet last year.  I figured I could live 6 months in Thailand, 1 month in Vietnam / Laos / Cambodia, and work 5 months in the UK.  I would have pretty much the exact same money I have now.  You can get rather nice condominiums out there for £30k.  If I did remote work whilst out there (which AFAIK would be illegal on a tourist visa) from a Dubai registered firm, I would probably have about 1.5 times the income I have now.

Convince me that I want to re-distribute my 'wealth' please?  As a 28 year old with assets of tiny value, I don't see why I am taxed heavily compared to a 60 year old with massive assets but lower paid job.

I had a TV licence guy ring my bell, then give me a letter that said ""we knocked but you weren't home"", I invited him in to see that I didn't need a licence but he refused.

I rang up the TV number and discovered he'd marked me down as not needing a licence.

Still don't understand why he rang my bell to give me a letter that said they came when I wasn't in.

true,ivanabiteyourfinger,cnty-scotland,Englishman in Pictland,"It's actually quite amusing at times (annoying as hell the other), as they expect either fearful compliance, or panicked denial. When you go to the door with the confidence of knowing they haven't a leg to stand on, it weirds them out for a bit.

""Are, are, you refusing to give me an answer"" (More attempts at intimidation as they try to imply you have a legal duty to answer).

""Yes, yes I am refusing to answer"".


I have to say though, that was a long time since doing that, I now just shut the door on them as soon as they tell me who they are. Very little point in being clever or trying to score points as they are like the walking dead. Smash one of their skulls open with a fossilised copy of the Radio Times and another shows up later anyway.

I do enjoy the ""story"" of the letters they send. First the general, ""YOU ARE GOING TO JAIL!!! ^^if ^^you ^^are ^^breaking ^^the ^^law""

Then we get the ""I'm an important person not to be ignored. You didn't reply to my first 100 letters, so I'm going to send you this mass produced letter that's been designed to look like it's being especially written just for you, even though we still don't know your name (despite it being easily available on the electoral register, not to mention the sign on the door). We've put you on our special list now, this is getting serious""

When you don't reply to that, then they send a white envelope with red lettering all over it and inside is ""WHEN YOU ARE IN COURT, THIS IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO YOU ^^if ^^you ^^are ^^breaking ^^the ^^law ^^and ^^we ^^catch ^^you, ^^even ^^though ^^we ^^have ^^nothing ^^on ^^you.""

Then the final (and for full effect, imagine this in Basil Fawlty's voice) ""RIGHT!, THAT'S IT! YOU ARE REALLY IN FOR IT NOW!!!"" letter arrives before the doorbell rings and you close the door in the face of the person.

Then you go back to the original letters again before the cycle repeats. This has been happening for about 30 years. You'd think they'd understand that I'm not going to play their game by now...


Now since the death of analogue TV's, they can't even remotely check with a detector van for signals now. The only ""tool"" they have is a lens that they are supposedly able to measure the lights flickering around edges of your curtains to see what you are watching, though quite how they are supposed to match that with the hundreds of TV channels being broadcast at any individual point is anyone's guess. More bluff I expect (That's why I put tool in quotes).

It would be funny if not for the worry they cause particularly elderly people. A former neighbour who was 96, bought a licence despite not having a TV, because she just wanted the intimidation to stop. 

Some people, including yourself, have variously claimed here they no longer get pestered, but that's hard to believe from where I'm standing as I've done all that you are meant to (Writing letters, making official complaints, withdrawing their assumed rights of access), each and every time the same answer comes.

true,HPB,eng-durham,Durham,"&gt;The police can't just decide for themselves

They can - if there's grounds for suspicion through intelligence received or events observed.

&gt;The police ought to have a solid, objective reason, supported by evidence of some sort, overseen by an impartial third party (the courts), before they can detain someone and search their belonging.

How on earth do you think this would work in real life. If a PC is walking down the street and a person tells him they've seen a bloke over the road with a knife do you *really* expect him to go and get a court order authorising a search ?

&gt;Saying he might have been carrying something dangerous is not enough without evidence to support such an assumption.

Miranda was potentially carrying information given by Snowden to Poitras to pass on to Greenwald. The Police suspect this information may have been a threat to national security. Reasonable grounds to stop.

&gt;Incidentally, this search, detention and denial of legal representation was conducted in the airport specifically because they would not have been able to legally do it in the UK proper.
They waited for him to be in the airport transfer lounge, away from proper UK legal protection and within the shady realm of the anti-terrorism act, before detaining him. This shows that they really didn't have any real evidence to justify a detention or arrest under proper UK law.

You're barking up the wrong tree here. He was *in transit* from Germany to Brazil via the UK. **He didn't enter the UK proper**. They waited in the transit area because *that's where he was going to be*. There's no point waiting at Immigration is there ? He was going to Brazil !

They also introduced the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, which rolled back a lot of the surveillance measures that the previous government introduced. For example:

* [Rolling back the genuinely insane powers that local councils were able to deploy under RIPA](http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/in-practice/changes-council-surveillance-powers). Previously councils were intercepting email and phone metadata, and launching covert surveillance, [to investigate dog-fouling and flytipping](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1584808/Council-spy-cases-hit-1000-a-month.html).

* Scrapping proposals for ID cards.

* Scrapping proposals for [a national vetting database for all adults in contact with children](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Safeguarding_Authority), which would have covered 11 million individuals, about one in five of the adult population.

* Reducing 'pre-detention' of terrorism suspects from 28 days to 14 days (the last government proposed 90 days).

* Removal of stop and search powers under the Terrorism Act 2000.

* Regulation and restriction of the national police numberplate recognition system, and of police powers to maintain DNA samples of people who were arrested but then not subsequently convicted.

IMO the problem is that all politicians who find themselves in a position of power, no matter what their intentions, get heavily leant on by the home office, the police, and the security services, and they do not have the courage, or feel like they have a strong enough mandate from the people to say no. We need parties to make opposition to surveillance a key part of their platform, so that when they get into power they have a strong foot-hold. We need parties which are liberal in a hard-nosed way.

true,DirtySketel,eng-merseyside,Liverpool,"I had a housemate who was an utter tosser. In the first 2 days of him living there, we agreed that we were happy not to have a tv licence because we wouldn't watch live tv.

The next day we found him watching live tv in the front room, with an aerial stretched right across the middle.

‘Oh so you got a tv licence?’

‘I looked up our house. We're already covered’

Of course, you can't just look up a house. I'm pretty sure that's even against Data Protection.

I looked this up, and of course, such a public database didn't exist.

‘Can you show me where you looked up the house?’

‘On the tv licence website’

‘Show me’

He gets his laptop, gets to the login screen of the tv licence website.

‘It's here’ he says. ‘! Anyway, I don't know what you're worried about: **only 13 people in the last 10 years have been prosecuted for tv licence evasion, and the fine is only about £20**’

I get my laptop and promptly debunk this claim.

‘Well, go on, log on’

‘Uhh I don't know the password’

‘How did you log on then?’

‘Oh.. umm... I must have logged in to my old house's account!’

‘That's great, you can transfer the account over to this house.’

‘Well, that's what I already did’

‘Okay, log on and show me.’

‘I left the log-in details at my old house’

‘Then how did you switch the account over to this one?’

‘Oh, maybe I didn't then.’

‘So why do you think this house is covered by a tv licence?’

‘The TV licence company personally emailed me!’

‘Show me’

He fires up his email and does a search for ‘tv licence’.

Obviously, there is nothing.

Eventually, I twisted his arm into buying a TV licence. Well, I twisted his arm into sharing the cost with the other housemates anyway...

Anyway, he had his friends round and let them damage the house for giggles then blamed my girlfriend, and was also caught stealing my girlfriend's worn panties. He also damaged stuff in his room and tried to fool us into signing a contract he'd written up saying we'd pay for it.

We kicked him out the house anyway. He was a grade-A cunt. And almost certainly had anti-social personality disorder.",0,1377110238,null,0,false,0,cbsfue8,t3_1ksojc,t1_cbsfue8,t3_1ksojc,null,1429749547,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

A. Accusing me of hubris by speaking for everyone does not invalidate my point about how the Mod's asked people not to post this way, or how this sub has been flooded with them.

B. That statement was not to be taken literally. ""No one care what you think"" is an insult that is meant to discourage future posts like this.

The throttling only affects things like P2P and Usenet, so that shouldn't be affecting your ability to work from home.

Project mgt - you could do a course like Prince2.  My work sent me on it, but some of my classmates were dissatisfied in their current jobs and were ""on holiday"", paying for the course themselves in order to boost the cv and make a career move.

Having done it I would say that it's very much a case of teaching you to pass a multiple choice exam on a theoretical 'perfect' system of PM probably very rare in the real world, _not_ actually teaching managing projects as they go in reality.  So unless you can combine with some real PM experience the cert isn't a magic bullet, although maybe it works that way to get past first round of HR screening, which is something.

In terms of being able to take on pseudo-management of people/projects/budgets at work, without actually being a manager, totally depends on the industry/workplace I guess.  I was able to do so when, for example, we got temps/interns in, I was bottom of the proper employee foodchain but still above them, voila some ""supervision"" and quality control of other people's time/work that you can dress up on the cv.  

And as for projects - an awful lot of 'stuff' that gets done in an awful lot of industries could be described as projects, and if you have any sort of planning/organisational/task-dishing-out/decision-making role in delivering that stuff, you can spin it towards PM on a CV even if your company doesn't concieve of ""project management"" as a discipline per se.

If I'd just said Willian playing central would give us 3 players for a single CAM position - Willian, Sigurdsson, Holtby - the easy response is that Holtby is actually more of a number 8 than a 10, so it's just two players for one position. But if we treat Holtby as a number 8 we now have 5 deep mids for two positions which is just as much of a problem as 3 CAMs for one position.

Given that, I just felt the point was more quickly and clearly made if we just consider all our central mids together as a group of 7 competing for 3 spots.

For the personal attention of Mr Edward Killesteyn PSM, Electoral Commissioner
Dear Electoral Commissioner,
Newspoll have broken Commonwealth Electoral Law and those responsible should be prosecuted and jailed.  ""Phony"" is a soft description. Rupert Murdoch is American and a foreign power, his corporations are being investigated by UK Police. The Australian Constitution prohibits Tony Abbott from sitting in the House of Representatives because he has an allegiance to Rupert Murdoch.

Any politician still associating with Murdoch is stupid. For Abbott to legally continue as a Candidate he must publicly disown Murdoch.

Every Labor Voter has the immediate right to Petition the High Court of Australia to have this corrupted Election voided in their own particular Electorate.  Every capable voter should do it.

The Electoral Commissioner is failing in his duty by not making a public statement.

In 1993 Murdoch's Cairns Post defamed the OzOne Party prior to the March 13th General Election. To keep the OzOne Party active I stood as a Candidate for Mayor of Cairns. Murdoch's Cairns Post conducted a popularity poll that showed me so far behind three of the other Candiidates we asked questions and found several people did multiple redialing for the other three and Telecom records confirmed this.  I took Supreme Court Action and then found Telecom had destroyed their records.

The whole Liberal Party, by still being linked to Rupert Murdoch, is a national disgrace for Australia.  All ties should be severed forthwith,

You should have prosecuted all of Murdoch's editors by now.  Instead the editors are now publishing ""phony"" poll results!   It is disgusting.   How are they bribing you?   I do not think it is with money and Rudd is being defamed during a Rudd Government!   Why have you not published legal advice to say I am wrong?   I hereby accuse you of nonfeasance.

Don't get me wrong - I have a flutter myself occasionally, but when you actually look up the odds it's insane. 

Matching 4 numbers gets you £94 this week, yet the odds are over 1000:1. 

Even if you get 5 numbers, it's not a life-changing amount - £2,350 - yet the odds are 55,000:1, meaning you're likely to win that much only if you were to play every week for 1000 years.

Please slap me if my maths is wrong, but IMO it's only worth buying a ticket if you're feeling a bit down and need a bit of an escapist fantasy to cheer you up.

 Also the security officers might not have necessarily known much about computers (if they had they wouldn't have thought that breaking a computer would permanently destroy the data) and just broken everything.

 To me the mobo looks like it was taken out of a laptop of some sort (possibly a macbook, but I wouldn't know, the ports you can still see as being there on the macbook are often kept on separate boards, which makes replacing them much easier and quicker). This would make sense as the other two black/blue on either side are deffo from laptops (the circular sections that are cut out are to make space for the fans and the cables on the opposite sides look like they are video cables for the laptop monitor).

 Something else that supports the security guys being less than knowledgeable (and that giving reason to them destroying a GPU) is the shoddy quality of the work done, it looks like they used a heat gun to remove the components but it was done by someone who had either no regard for the kit and was damaging it on purpose (and taking more time than necessary to do so) or someone who had literally no idea what they were doing.",0,1377114854,null,0,false,0,cbshsdv,t3_1kt3yx,t1_cbshsdv,t1_cbscfba,null,1429748640,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I was rather annoyed by the fact that the Doctor comes to America, and gets gunned down in a drive-by shooting. As an American fan of the show, I was insulted by the fact that he goes other places and regens while saving the world/universe, and here he's shot in the alley when he steps out of the Tardis. 

   As for Eric Roberts Master, the less said about that hammy performance, the better in my book. The companion was allright, but bland, and ultimately forgettable.

   McGann was good, and probably would've gotten better in the role if he had a chance. It's a shame he didn't. 

   The worst part of the movie was the revising of continuity it attempted. The Doctor's half-human?! The Master has super-powers?! What the?!

   But, in the end, it was a decent adventure of the Doctor's, and I'm kind of glad they didn't just ignore it when they re-launched the show and that it's still considered a part of the Doctor's history.

As for Chelsea, I was not fan of RDM's  and Rafa's style; but was pretty happy with AVB and believed in him. Also, I don't watch matches live anymore, because of lack of options. So, these days I don't take part in any technical discussion about a match.

In the case of the Daily Mail, they would never report like this on the Edinburgh Festival.

true,ivanabiteyourfinger,cnty-scotland,Englishman in Pictland,"&gt; I really never thought about how senior citizens and other more vulnerable people are literally being bullied into purchasing this if they don't need them. There's gotta be a better way to get people to pay.

Through our taxes like every other publicly owned company or business. The licence isn't fair on other TV networks anyway, especially now we are in this world of cable and online streaming services offering hundreds of channels. 

What people don't realise is the BBC has a very profitable commercial side which is kept entirely separate from the publicly funded side through careful legal means.

When the licence holder pays to create a TV show like Blackadder, the commercial side sells that show on DVD and to other networks around the world for huge profits (Like Dave, that place seems to show BBC shows almost exclusively) with very little, if any of that money being used to fund further programming. And remember, the BBC receive payments each time the show is repeated, not just at the point of sale.

If you think how many times Blackadder has been shown around the world, that's not an inconsiderable sum. And that's just one show.

The BBC can afford to fund itself in it's entirety, but there are many political reasons why that won't happen. 
 
&gt; EDIT: Is it possible to file for harrassment if you've been receiving the same letters for 30 years?

Yes, but I need to pay the legal costs myself. Capita Business Services Ltd have a habit of making you turn up to court only to find they have dropped any objection, leaving you to foot the bill. Being a civil matter, you don't get legal aid.

They also do that for a number of prosecutions for people they've caught who decide to show up in court. So if any of you reading this have been caught, that day in court might serve you better than you think. Especially if you ask them to provide the evidence that they used to obtain the warrant (They have a habit of dropping cases very quickly when you do). 

Most people will plead guilty by letter and then get a fine. It's the non-payment of that fine that gets people locked up because while not having a licence when required is a civil offence, non payment of the fine is a criminal.

The last time I looked into this, there were a disproportionally high number of single mothers in the cells due to the obvious problem single mothers have with money and being mostly housebound, tend to watch TV more than other groups which increases the likelihood the TV will be on and audible when the goons from Capita show up.",0,1377117038,null,0,false,0,cbsipy9,t3_1ksojc,t1_cbsipy9,t1_cbshv6v,null,1429748205,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"&gt;I don't see why I am taxed heavily compared to a 60 year old with massive assets but lower paid job

Because our system is set up to value private property. If someone has worked to earn enough money to buy something the law says that we respect that and basically let them do what they want with it and don't tax them. If you got taxed on your wealth (property or shares etc) there would be much less motivation to own anything because you just get taxed more. We respect people's owned property so we leave them to enjoy it. A 60 year old with huge assets must have had a high paid job to get his/her assets (unless they inherited them in which case they're luck and don't really apply). So they have gone through the same stage as all of us being taxed for the earnings me make while older people owned their own houses and had savings to live off. Before Thatcher the highest rate of tax was [over 80% and even after that it fell to 60%](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/stats/tax_structure/incometaxrates_1974to1990.pdf) before falling further. Everyone has paid their part so criticising old people because they aren't still being taxed hard is a bit harsh. 

&gt;Why should I be frugal

I'm a bit confused. You don't get taxed more the more assets you save up. In fact the more frugal you are and the more you can live of assets not earning the less you will be taxed. If you had a huge portfolio of shares and you lives of the capital gains you would only pay about 20% tax. 

&gt;Plenty of which I think they do utterly terribly.

Perhaps but compared to other countries we don't do badly in education and quite well in terms of healthcare. We have a very low crime rate and a well respected police force. There are things the government does poorly but most of it is done well. If it's not done to your satisfaction you can hold the government to account via your MP in a way you wouldn't be able to do if it was just a company who administered schooling or policing. 

&gt;I struggle with 50%

So do I and most other people. When the majority of what you earn goes to other people you start to question why you should work harder. [The Laffer Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve#Tax_rate_at_which_revenue_is_maximized) is a graph that shows a curve that peaks when the most revenue is raised and shows that as the tax rate get higher revenue drops. If you taxed everyone at 100% no-one would pay it and you'd get no money. The peak is different for each country and depends on what people value. In the US it's around 35% however they have fewer and less universal public services than in the UK. IN Sweden it was estimated to be around 70% because people are more willing to pay tax if they feel like society benefits. In the UK it seems like 50% is the peak. The 50% tax rate did raise a bit of money but not enough to make it worth the effort. Revenue did increase but it was not efficient enough to collect (something the Laffer curve does not take into account). So most other people struggle with 50% too.",0,1377117189,null,0,false,0,cbsis9s,t3_1krbfa,t1_cbsis9s,t1_cbsejvc,null,1429748175,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Same story at CB. We should be good to cope with what we have until January, give Fryers and Capoue some games there when we need to. I have high hopes for Fryers.

Wish we'd signed Figueroa: LB and CB covered well by one player, and he would likely have been happy to be a back up/play some Europa league matches for a bigger team at the end of his career rather than turning out for yet another relegation dog fight.

His movement off the ball pulls defenders all over the place, he literally tears defences apart with his movement off the ball. And when you have 3 players behind him constantly making runs, you can see how our midfield got 71 goals last season.

He is obviously still a world class player, who has many dimensions to his game, he has won everything a player can win, won golden boots at the highest level, and still gets in the Spanish side.

Henderson has unbelievable energy, he is not as good a tackler but against most teams we should be moving forward anyway so his energy can allow us to win it back further up the pitch. His main downfall is his positional sense, he is a bit freeform and I am never quite sure where he actually plays, coincidentally that is also Lucas's biggest strength.

Allen's positional sense on the other hand is actually quite good, he isn't a great tackler but he will nip at your heels and if he gets the ball tends to distribute it quickly and effectively (when playing well of course) whereas Lucas will employ a safety first approach most of the time after winning the ball back.

 Its ironic that a hundred years ago that in this country, millions of workers were pushing union rights, an 8 hour work day and child labor laws. In fact, Eugene Debbs, the leader of the socialist party, was an actual contender in the 1912 presidential election. Most Americans don't know that The City of Milwalukee elected a socialist mayor 3 times and at the time America was leading in the progressive movement.

 Another fact that Americans refuse to accept is that we haven't been Lessie-Faire since the Great Depression and Social Security is a socialist program, but they will get angry if they don't recieve any benefits that the program grants them...

 Anyhow I'm ranting but I'm trying to give a first hamd perspective. Of course not all Americans are that dense but not all Americans can actually debate facts or theory... A lot just regurgitate what they heard from a major news source, left or right.

Sure, you do that now and then, but you have to agree that you did. 

We won playing extreme defensive against barca, and we accepted that. It is a game of winning, and if we did, great showing for the team. But, if other team had a bad day, it was not a fair fight. A true champion believes in his ability, and will always prefer a fair game. We don't just want us to win title, we want to be considered true champion. 

On a similar note, most of us do feel sorry for Arsenal too, considering their bad luck with injuries. Again, it is awesome to see them lose, but we want to see a fair game. Seeing them lose because they don't even have a full squad to field in a game, is sad, unless you are a nutjob. We want them to go down with their full strength squad, so that they can't blame it on injuries. We don't want them to lose because they don't have enough players.

Meaning, if Kolo hadn't shown himself to be so up for it, I'd have thought we needed someone of higher quality. But he seems like he could be adequate quality for up to a year. Thats huge for us because it means we don't have to be held for ransom by anyone. We can wait for the right deal and the right player. Optimally, a younger lad who could arguably be there for years to come and at least retain sell on value for the next 5-6 years. 

As far as attack, I think we're at the point where we should only sign a player if he's going to seriously improve our chances at getting top 4. I think our squad is good enough to get 5th right now. That doesn't mean we should be satisfied with that. It simply means we shouldn't bring in a player who isn't seriously going to push us past that.

I thought Mickey and Costa were players who could help us push top 4. Willian I was never sold on. And nearly all the other attacking options we've been linked with since and during those failings don't seem like players who push us to top 4.

It may be frustrating for fans but we know all too well that a signing does not mean pushing the club forward. More often than not when people say they want a marquee signing they only mean someone who costs a lot of money. Because the fact is most of the players we could sign are not guaranteed PL quality. They aren't sure bets. Such is the life of a team outside of Europe. But fans think if you spend 25+ on a guy from an obscure European league that he must be the business. Or they think the interest of rival clubs is the same as meaning they're going to set the PL alight. It just isn't so.

So right now I'd rather us spend no money at all than sign a guy to appease the marquee signing crowd who isn't going to help us move up the table. I think we've enough about us to pip Arsenal to 5th with our squad as is.

*The War Zone* is directed by Tim Roth and is the only film I've ever seen where Ray Winstone actually manages to do some decent acting. It's beautifully shot and directed in the Devon countryside but is quite difficult to watch, I found the tension almost unbearable.

Other than that *Attack The Block* is excellent (even if it should be called *Defend The Block*) and although I don't tend to like RomComs *Beautiful Thing* is perhaps an exception.

To be considered high risk at a prison for the most dangerous prisoners is quite a significant achievement.  

While I absolutely agree that prison guards abuse their position in many situations, I think its probably not likely in this particular situation given the watchdog is on them for it. 

Whats striking is that this was actually overall n incredibly good report, but the prison is finding itself utterly slated in the press because of their failing here. So it is definitely in the prison's interest to not let some self righteous screw mess with her on this issue.

The staff were also described as ""doing their best"" by the Howard Trust, who are intensely critical of prisons (laudably so), and they wouldn't have said that were they not at least highly likely.

Susan adopted an Earth name and decided to enrol at a local school. She was looking for a place to belong to, and even suggested later in the first episode that she'd be happier staying in 1963 than leaving with her grandfather.

She ended up sticking out like a sore thumb, which prompted her nosey teachers to follow her home one night. They gained access to the Tardis, and the Doctor literally kidnapped them. He refused to let them leave in case exposure to the Tardis drove the pursuit of technology before its time.

Eventually he ended up warming to them and they became quite close. I guess the Doctor was also looking for somewhere to belong.

The vast majority of acts are not from Edinburgh or even Scotland. The Bradley Manning play she mentions is a Welsh product. At the same time, why the hell can't we look at a situation from a different perspective? 

The fact the Fringe exists in Scotland is a product of the nature of open-mindedness we all share. This type of thing couldn't exist in America; there are too many divergent minds, too few jingoistic shows espousing the wonderfulness of the Dear Leader for the average Joe to handle.

The world is not your viewpoint. That is a mindset toddlers shed when they learn about object permanence. Something doesn't cease to be true because you believe it isn't. Art opens our minds to world-views we would never come across and the performances at the Fringe always have such wonderful breadth of perspective, there's something for every taste. 

To come away from the largest arts festival in the world with a negative view because she cherry-picked some raucous and 'anti-American' shows out of over two and a half thousand is ridiculous. How can someone write for a newspaper with a mindset as sealed to the world as hers?

Scotland was never truly about thistle and bagpipes. That facade was created by Sir Walter Scott to drive tourism when the country was struggling economically. Some of the greatest minds to ever grace this world have come from here. Only a few months ago we lost one of the best writers of the past century. All of this doesn't disappear because we are a socialist nation, if anything it breeds the literati and intelligentsia we are famous for. 

I hope this gets more traction and shows the insularity of this middle-American to the world. Socialism is perhaps not the perfect system -- which does not exist, if we are to believe that scoundrel Karl Marx -- but it works for us. I enjoy 'free' education, 'free' healthcare in a relatively liberal country because of the UK's political ethos. Changing would mean paying more of those evil taxes though wouldn't it? Can't have that in Capitalist America, no siree. In Right-Wingers we trust.

Also a mention of how difficult it is to deal with prisoners with personality disorders. They say it's a national problem not a problem with the prison itself. They also say there needs to be better access to offsite treatment while mentioning that in general addiction treatment at the prison is quite good.

I could be misreading, but it seems to me they would love to say more bluntly that this is an inadequacy in how the system handles prisoners with mental health issues but refrain from being direct so as not to reveal medical information about this specific prisoner.

My point is, that as we had a good run of form towards the end of his stint, people seem to gloss over all the catastrophic failures, terrible matches, horrible tactical decisions, bizarre press conferences etc. 'We won a second rate competition that we really should have won anyway, so therefore Benitez did a brilliant job!1' Similarly in the league, 3rd was really the minimum expectation, so though Benitez deserves some credit for achieving this, I'll stop short of fellating him at any given opportunity.",0,1377126518,null,0,false,0,cbsmf77,t3_1ktt4a,t1_cbsmf77,t1_cbsm9pu,null,1429746444,13,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,13

The warrant is basically the judge saying the company has authorised these employee's to act on their companies behalf for the purposes of searching and he requires you to give them access for this purpose.  

Because they need your consent, when you don't give it, they have to apply for another warrant (which you can treat the same). And that's it... The entire bite behind that very loud bark.

This might sound strange, but remember you are presumed innocent until proven guilty in this country. The TV people are trying to find evidence to incriminate you for the purposes of a prosecution. In effect, by agreeing to let them in, you are incriminating yourself (if you have been watching TV illegally). 

You have committed no crime at this point and so the police officer with them has no reason to arrest you. The TV people are only attempting to find evidence on the limited authority the judge gave them to do this and this requires you to willingly give them access. Remember, warrant or no, these are just civilians working for a commercial company. They have no more rights or power than you do.


Edit: Changed ""permission"" to ""consent"" and did a rewrite to better explain.

Edit2: Legal disclaimer. Refusing a warrant may have more serious repercussions than I said, your mileage may vary. I am not a lawyer, or current with the legal status, so I may be entirely wrong.

There's certainly quality there, albeit youthful. They'll certainly be hungry to prove their worth and win a place in the first XI, but with the lack of game-changing star players on the bench much of our bench's effectiveness rests on BR's shoulders.

I remember games, though none specifically at the moment, where we were struggling and BR made  a substitution I had found odd (like Allen for Borini or something) and the midfield shifted and the pace of the game altered in our favor. If we compare our bench with Chelsea's we may not inspire too much confidence in ourselves, but there is talent there. Rodgers just needs to be the man to unlock it.

If someone had stolen that information in order to sell it to a foreign nation we'd probably all back the government asking this lone-agent to destroy it but because we know and have been told it contains incriminating evidence of government over reach we want to know. The act is identical but the motivation and probable results are different. It was a stupid move on the government's part but those documents remain stolen information and what the Guardian is doing is pretty dodgy legally. The fact that they would rather have equipment destroyed than go to court shows they know that. They say it could fall into the wrong hands and could cause deaths which seems very unlikely but if it were true would be valid...it's just not true though. However the general public wants an exception to those rules because of the potentially serious nature of the information. There's no clear cut answer there. In other words - the government has legal wiggle room.

The Miranda issue is about use of terror laws to intimidate which quite clearly was the case and is clearly wrong. There can be no defending that in any context.

Why do you think a group that a politician such as SARAH PALIN (perhaps one of the most right winged politicians to ever grace the currently most right winged country in the world) supports isn't going to be insanely right wing?

Oh right, I thought you could vote for the Tea party am I wrong? 

I can assure you now that most political systems we have in place are technically 'fascist' (try and ignore the negative connotation, but rather how our governments place corporation first).  That includes both the U.S. and U.K. The labour, conservative, republican and democrat parties are all right wing, and the tea party is just extremely right wing.  

If anything, Europeans are much much quicker to label anything fascist, while I have heard multiple U.S. news agencies label basic human health care as 'communism'.  If you took the N.H.S. (the result of 'left wing' politics, because yeh with modern advancements in technology you aren't enititled to have your health looked after regardless of wealth) away there would be riots.
