But yeh, loved the part where Jess said ""just stop being a stubborn bitch and forgive him"" - then wham. Powerful moment. A favourite moment of the season - 'you won a quid, pissed yourself and then got electrocuted' - absolute classic Misfits right there, the one thing about this series Ive enjoyed is the writing, they do the characters so well, only 1 or 2 episodes this whole series Ive been a bit 'meh' about, and tbh they werent anything to complain about, the rest have been hugely entertaining. And Finn's use of the piano was... exceptional. He finally did something other than struggling to move a cup with his power!

Luuk is not playing much at the moment but he is young and has potential.

I'd rather stick to Guidetti and keep Dzeko and Jovetic.

At the end of the season we could be able to judge the Dzeko situation better, but the striker market is tricky, and find a better striker than Dzeko is not that easy. We'll see.

The nurses I dealt with when I was last in hospital were anything but ""top notch"", and that's multiple shifts across multiple wards.

There were a couple that were absolute diamonds, but that's by no means universal.

The equipment was not what I would consider to be ""top notch"" but then it doesn't need to be - it only needs to get the job done with a minimum of fuss. The equipment in the US will be newer/better/shinier/whatever but I'm not convinced that leads to better outcomes. This is not a criticism - we shouldn't spend money on the most expensive kit if there are cheaper alternatives.

The doctors were good, when you see them. It would have been better to have more time with them, but I understand they are busy and doubly so at consultant level.

The buildings, oh the buildings were utterly shocking. If you could promise me that privatisation would deliver shiny new buildings to every hospital across the land then I'd be in like a shot. I don't know how we expect people to get better in some of the facilities we have.

For example lets say speeders cause car crashes and drunk drivers also cause car crashes - both (for sake of argument) in equal measure. For the sake of simplicity speeders and drunk drivers don't have any influence on each other and crashes are only caused by these groups. 

In this overly simplified example, incidence of drunk driving could drop while incidence of crashes could increase - so long as there were more speeders. This would be represented as a negative correlation between the two, but obviously doesn't imply no causation, as we are aware of other factors.

Its a two way street. Correlation itself neither proves or disproves causation. Even when fully separated from all other factors, you'd have to ensure that you can say thing A causes thing B and not thing B causes thing A. 

However, it is normally considered the job of the person making claims to prove them, not the job of the person not making claims to disprove them - as Hitchens said; 'What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.' Largely this is in reference to religion, but I feel the concept applies pretty much universally. Anyone can claim anything, and the problem is people seem to think that claiming something amounts to providing evidence for it. 

This is my sticking point with the arguments to ban rape porn. Assertions are made, emotional appeals are littered throughout it, some irrelevant statistics are shown, and nothing approaching any evidence is given that there would be less rape or sexual assault or that it would improve the lives of women in any way whatsoever or that public views would shift at all.

He has indeed learned a lot in few months at Everton. I have never seen him track back as much has he did in the last 3-4 games.  

Your analysis is partially correct.  

Deulo can play the system. Although Barca B under the current coach Eusebio was using a  very loose variation of the Barca way, it still was a bit similar to the normal Barca way. Under Eusebio our midfield was weak and the transition was rapid most times.  
The is the Spanish National U sides which play the traditional modern Spanish way.  

Martinez's system is analogous to these.  
The point about Lukaku is true. Since he is not someone who presses from the front or is that good with his back to goal that means playing Deulo would have the team having 2 players Not pressing.  
This is unsustainable, even at Barca there is only 1 player at a time who is free from the press duty(be it Ronaldinho or Messi now).  

So if a player like Jelavic was played who wouldn't mind the press, it will free up Deulo.  

Deulo is very versatile can play even down the middle and can combine plays but the problem with him is he is impatient, he wants to enter the attack as soon as possible, too soon in fact, this is where his knack for shooting early comes in as well. 

So wrapping up, Deulo can work under the Martinez's system, its the major reason Barca even went ahead with this loan, because they know Martinez has a track record to back his play up over the years and Deulo fits in that system.   
It just needs few tweaks to facilitate Deulo more seamlessly rather than include him with some extra risk.

Eto'o is inconsistent in this regard but is still an improvement over Torres because, as you say, he makes space for himself. He'll go through one match having quite a few chances and the next he won't have a shot for the entire game.

Ba offers us something different, he's hungry and wants to score. You can see it in the way he plays. He's alert in and around the box, the goal that was wrongly ruled off for offside is a great example of this. I've yet to see such instinctive like movement from either Torres or Eto'o. He's not the most skillfull player, he does a pretty good spider on a hotplate impression but he's a proper striker. The biggest compliment I can give him is that with him in the team we always look like scoring. I can't say the same about Torres and Eto'o.

I'm not saying it's fine for our strikers to miss chances, what I'm saying is that, in the case of Torres and, sometimes, Eto'o them getting the chances in the first place is an improvement over what they normally offer us.

Where can I read about the second stage of the act? 

Taken from the explantory notes on legislation.gov.uk 

&gt;The general exclusion of hereditary peers from membership of the House in section 1 of the Act does not apply to 90 hereditary peers 

&gt;Standing Order 9 (Election of Hereditary Peers) provides for 75 of the 90 excepted peers to be elected from among the overall number of hereditary peers. 

&gt;Standing Order 9 also provides that any vacancies arising due to the death of one of the 90 excepted peers shall be filled by the nearest runner-up in the relevant election or, if none is willing or available, by whatever means the House of Lords itself decides.


I think you are getting confused. Hereditary peerages still exist and they are not solely to do with the right to sit in the House of lords. Even if they abolished the House of Lords they will still exist. 90 members of the House of Lords will be hereditary peers when one of them dies another is elected **from the ranks of existing hereditary peers**. Because the Lords will probably continue breeding there will continue to be more Lords who inherit the titles that have been in their family for genereations and then they will become eligible to be voted in as one of the 90 excemptions. 

&gt;An Act to restrict membership of the House of Lords by virtue of a hereditary peerage;

That is the actual purpose of the act, to restrict it. The bit which says ""No-one shall be a member of the House of Lords by virtue of a hereditary peerage."" is misleading. They have made it so that the Lords aren't techinically sitting in the House based off of a hereditary peerage, techincally they have been voted in and that is why they are a member. Obviously the huge flaw beign that they are voted in by other Lords...

Even if I'm wrong about the legal side is the House of Lords really going to vote itself out of existance?

A) I based the names on [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1sgnof/the_of_the_doctor/cdxvcbg) comment, which includes name frequency info that I included, so for example you're way more likely to  get ""The something of the Daleks"", since Daleks is included 11 times in the database, as opposed to say ""The something of Traken"", since Traken is only listed once. I'll tweak it and try and make it more random, however I figure that having stuff like ""of the Daleks"" and ""of the Cybermen"" show up regularly is probably a desirable thing.

B) 'sense' is kind of a difficult line to draw. I'd wager that the vast majority make sense, though there are quite a few slightly esoteric names that get generated (for example, The Terror of Fear, or The Day of Tomorrow), but the 'sense' these make are largely a matter of interpretation. And as /u/Theniallmc says below, the weirder ones tend to be amusing.

A few years ago I had a derestricted brand new Aprilia RS 125. Brilliant little bike and I used it to commute 40 miles a day for 4 years all year round in Devon. Never missed a beat. However, I wouldn't recommend it - you'll never pick up a new 2 Stroke one anymore, and second hand ones, well, would you want to buy something expensive to run that's probably been maintained by a 17 year old?

I picked up a 2005 CG 125 for ¬£950. It's not exciting, it's dog slow, but I can get by on ¬£10 a week in petrol (the car was costing ¬£50+ on the same commute), insurance is nothing, and it's bulletproof and easy to work on.

I'm going to ride it through the winter to reacquaint myself (until I redid my CBT the other week, it had been 5 years since I'd been on a bike) and do my DAS in the summer and get something else. But it's an easy bike to live with, won't let you down, and if I'm honest, I've probably learned more riding this than I ever did on the RS as you can't rely on power to get you out of trouble (or brakes to stop you) so you have to constantly think ahead, and plan well in advance.

It's such a scam. There's absolutely no reason why we should have to pre-pay for hours of parking we don't need, and why the machines can't give change whatsoever.

If you're after ease of [verification](https://ibwt.co.uk/en/company/verification)

IBWT is easier and requires less on verification, (this is because of not imitating, nor needing a banks model).

And IBWT is immune to having customers transactions frozen and/or bank accounts frozen/closed. 

But again, I repeat, quantity on IBWT is currently low compared to the other places you can acquire Bitcoins (in the UK), this is due to only having re-launched a few weeks ago, and needing more time to attract traders.

However - IBWT does enforce a 2fa (email totp), which some find awkward and prefer no 2fa. We will probably add on an option to turn this off once logged into accounts, but we do prefer customer accounts (especially new bitcoiners) to remain secure.

IBWT also allows the option of 3fa (google authenticator) and there is a 2fa (email) for Btc/Ltc withdrawal.

Which brings us onto Litecoin - you can also acquire Litecoins on the IBWT platform (for ¬£ or Btc), and day trade (with for example - [Btc-e](https://btc-e.com/exchange/ltc_btc)

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; would be cool to see that compared to the pre-Mod 1/Mod 2 regime

There's no direct comparison between the pre-mod 1/2 era and the present testing regime for practical tests. 

But figures for the theory test do go back to April 2007, so include the 2 years prior to the introduction of the Mod 1 on 27th April 2009. 

However, it should be noted the figures for these two years (2007-09) are skewed - inflated with a surge of riders trying to pass before the new regime took hold. 

A smaller surge took place again in 2012 prior to the Jan 2013 new licence categories.

His goal tally at club level is roughly one in four. That's on par or better than a lot of premiership strikers past and present.

He doesn't get great service at his club but is showing huge signs of improvement. He's making goals for himself this year. Last year his club played one striker mostly and Lukaku kept him out of the team. There's no shame in that. He's a top player. 

We're not looking to replace Suarez or Sturridge. We're looking to add competition. I'm not arguing is he better than Aspas or Borini. I've seen him for Ireland, West Brom and Reading. He'll run himself into brick walls. Given better service he'll score too.

You are effectively saying that just because a white person in power is making choices that limit the choices and freedoms of none white people for their own good that there is not reason at all you might want to talk about the fact that person is white or that it might be another expression of a systemic racial issue. 

&gt;When Thatcher was in power, as a female, would it have been fair to say ""women are collectively destroying the financial stability of all the men in the world by closing the predominantly male mining industry""? No? Well fuck your double standard hypocracy.

That argument is absurd and not in the way you intended it to be. I could point out all the ways in which it is no way relevant but it's simply easier to point to the bits that are... which is none of it at all. I admit that's not actually an argument and you can beat me about the head with that if you like but... ya... I just don't no how to handle it.

&gt;Funny, you even disagree with the writer of the article who said that watching such material doesn't affect people. 

Funny that you selectively quote me to avoid the point. Well done. 

Talking of quotes please quote the part in which Graham says people can't be effected by porn? I won't wait because she doesn't, not once, but hey lets not let those pesky *facts* get in the way of making your point! Wouldn't want you to actually have to stop and think about this for a second, that might get dangerously close to having to challenge your pre-convinced notions. 

My point, and the point Graham is making in her piece (that you seem so insistent on ignoring) is that BSDM is based around mutual consent and mutual enjoyment. As quoted in the piece ""Rape play is about power, but it is a negotiated exchange of power to enable the people involved to act out their fantasies in a consensual and empowering manner."" or in other words either party can say ""stop"" and it stops because *everything* is predicated on mutual consent and respect of that consent. This is what makes it play and not abuse and why BSDM porn often includes interviews that seek to show that consent and enjoyment and why it can be problematic if that is missing in mainstream porn that can be incredibly violent and degrading to the women involved as par of the course.   

&gt;But clearly you're correct because you once fucked a MSDM fetishist or something.

So you want to argue that she is ""biased by her self-confessed violent BDSM fetish."" but suddenly a person having an understanding of some of the aspects of those fetishes but does not share is totally irreverent... funny that.",0,1386940836,null,0,1386941565,0,ce0sioa,t3_1sq5dc,t1_ce0sioa,t1_ce0s1bq,null,1428149868,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

Or left out in favor of aging superstars. 

I'm not saying that Bertrand is better than Shaw or that he has the potential to even come close to what Cole has been, but if this club is actually serious about building a sustainable team to beat FFP then the management needs to start showing some commitment to those players and make the hard choices.

I don't understand why you would think this. Unemployed people have to pay bills just like employed people do, they don't get many ""Oh you can't afford this so you don't have to pay this"" perks. Sadly.

Anyway, as others have said, you'll need to talk to the council directly. If you were receiving JSA at the time then that should reduce the amount you have to pay, and also, if you were the only person not a student at the time then I'm pretty sure you could qualify for ""single person occupancy"" which reduces the amount you have to pay as well.

* Type 45 destroyer: Initial ¬£5.4 billion, Final ¬£6.5 billion, Increase 18%

Since 2007, whilst a lot of projects came in under budget, the average cost overrun of government projects is 38%, which means the **HS2 budget should be, ¬£38 billion** going on the averages.

Does the government really expect us to believe that this project will come in on time and under budget?

However, what does appear to be true is that she fucking miscarried in prison and was forced to clean it up. That's horrible! Why does the media feel the need to distract from this? Can't we be trusted to get to come to our own conclusions?

When you message a girl first read their profile, find out what they like.  Read between the lines see what might interest them. Don't just say 'how's things!'

I would say, something along the lines of: hi i see you like walking, it looks like we have at least one thing in common. Maybe tell a short interesting story that goes with it.

&gt; UTD will definitely sign Baines in Jan

I thought Martinez had expressed that he had no intentions of letting Baines leave just this past summer. Everton look like they have the endurance to actually maintain a European berth this season, whereas Moyes seems to be having some adjustment issues. They certainly have promise in Oviedo but he's 23, Baines is a leader in the LB slot. Why sell?


&gt; ¬£30m for Shaw, so they'd probably want even more in Jan, so I highly doubt this deal will go

Agreed. That and we've had Azpilicueta playing LB for the past few weeks, Cole is now back, we've got Bertrand on the bench, and we've got van Aanholt on loan (although I'm willing to be he'll be shipped off in the summer). ¬£30m+ is a big ask in January when the money could be saved or spent elsewhere.

&gt; Matic

I think a lot of people have drank the Matic kool-aid, so to speak. He's talented and has matured really well at Benfica. That being said, I read an article prior to the UEFA Cup final this past season in which Jesus attributed Chelsea swapping him with money for David Luiz as throwing a young Matic under the bus. He seemed critical of that, and now big European clubs (like Chelsea) are coming knocking for someone who could be ranked among the best CDM's in Europe. 

I think Jorge Jesus is going to be unwilling to let the Primeira's player of the year go, at least cheaply. So I would expect Chelsea if they were to pick him up, to pay through the nose for him. 

Then again, Benfica could just roll over and take money like most Portuguese clubs do when the big European institutions of football come looking for young talent.

So maybe it works the other way too and they are anticipating further cuts so try to save a bit for a rainy day? There's nothing too bad about that imo.

Also worth pointing out that the NHS in 2012-13 still saw a 0.6% rise in real term spending (2.6% more in total than the previous year), so there haven't really been ""cuts"", just a slowdown in spending increases.

Neither of us know (as it's not reported) what work was supposed to be carried out by Probation. However, it's very likely she will have had a Supervision Order with a Drug Rehabilitation Order attached. If she was on this then she would have had the specialist help you refer to.

It specifically mentions drug reduction and physical and psychological help](http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/pdf/SaferPeterborough-Priorities-SubstanceMisuse-Drugs-DrugTreatmentSystemPathway.pdf).

He brought the show back to air successfully, Season 1 was fantastic and I loved it when I was a kid. This was helped by Eccleston's top notch performance for a role he didn't really enjoy or care for.

true,IntellegentIdiot,flair5,,"&gt;Defoe goals in the Europa League were previously dismissed for being against easy opponents. Bobby scores against the same opposition and it is being cited as evidence he is clinical.

No. It just demonstrates that Defoe shouldn't be starting ahead of Soldado based on the fact he scored against easier teams. The problem was the over simplistic view of a minority that a few goals in europe meant that he was going to perform better in the premiership than Soldado. Thing is, we know how Defoe performs in the premiership so he's performances against West Ham and Sunderland reinforced that.

The biggest problem Defoe has is reliability, he'll get the ball and often unleash a tame effort right at the keeper. It's not that it's awful, it's that he's awful sometimes. People will remember the two goals he scored in an europa league game earlier in the season but forget the two sitters he passed to the keeper.

Soldado's problem is getting the ball. Despite what people seem to believe he's usually in a good position and he's simply waiting for a decent ball he can run on to. Unfortunately the players seem to want to do it all themselves or refuse to pass to him. Had Soldado got the same kind of service that was on show against Sunderland he'd have scored.

Yes, Defoe has scored a lot of goals for us in the premiership and in europe, it's because he's been with us for so many years! He's made 359 appearances for us, this january will be the 10th anniversary of his signing, marking 9 years as a Spurs player.

Before people say well he's not putting in effort because he's not getting minutes he wants, why does he deserve more minutes if he doesn't want to put in a shift when he appears currently? Not worth the risk. We stick Willian on and he'll chase down every ball. That will cause Jose to go 'hang on, he really wants this'. De Bruyne needs to be doing the same, and just plain hasn't with the (admittedly not many) chances he's had so far.

He'll likely start against Sunderland midweek. THAT is his chance to impress.

This also keeps the brooding sadness of 9 and 10 in tact. They leave the gallery, the time vortex makes them forget, and they assumed that since they couldn't find Gallifrey -- they had ultimately destroyed it with The Moment because that was the last thing War Doctor remembers doing before the vortex appears.

When the vortex first appears 11 says ""I remember this"" and throws his fez through. Everything that was happening was in 11's current timeline, and so it isn't until War, 10, and 11 are stopped by Clara that the Doctor realizes what he had already done.

Time is cyclical in the Whoniverse, and it took 3 regenerations and 11 spending 400 years to think about it but he had already done it with all his previous incarnations stuck inside 11's time vortex.

So none of the previous incarnations will remember locking Gallifrey until 11 comes up with the idea.

However, the law regarding hand guns in Britain changed pretty quickly following Dunblane, partly as a consequence of the lack of a constitution in Britain, and partly because the UK government is composed of the majority party (or coalition) in Parliament, whereas in the US you could have a Democratic president by Republican Senate/House, slowing things down.

That's not to say that the ability to change the law quickly in the UK is necessarily a good thing, and having an actual constitution would certainly be beneficial in that it could provide near-irrevocable protection for what some may see as a fundamental right, such as free at point of use healthcare.

In sum, I'd say yes but that it's not necessarily beneficial under all circumstances.

In such situations government should have mandatory English lessons, possibly funded or partially funded by government and at the same time provide some benefits to that guy. If he isn't willing to meet those conditions (doesn't bother learning English, which would improve his chances to find new work), if he doesn't actively looks for work only then take away his benefits.

- So, if an EU immigrant knows English language and wants to take benefits he can do it easily? I would suggest even step further, if someone (whether EU immigrants speaking English or British citizen) takes jobless benefits and ""can't"" find work even though it is being proposed to him from Job centre, just take away his benefits.

Implanting the master didn't break the jtimelock, because that event happened on Galifray, and the Time Lords are able to manipulate the time vortex, no time travel required. 

The name of the Doctor happened in his time stream, creating a paradoxical loop that had no affect on his life, since it already happened that way for him. 

Day of the Doctor was a character piece. The plot had nothing to do with anything: case and point: what happened in the negotiations with the Zygons?  And once again, it was a paradoxical loop, nothing changed, it had already happened that way. 

The ending of series 5 and 6 both happen in alternate universes where none of their actions carry over.  

Hell, Moffat even likes to pretend that everyone on Earth has forgotten about the invasions during the Davies era, because that would require something to stick. Moffat prefers character development over character progression, which isn't inherently bad, but many of his plots seem more like backdrops than actual problems. Like the Zygons.

While I may disagree with the idea of Parliament deciding who gets to vote for Parliament, this statement is accurate, and nothing to do with the ECtHR.

The ECtHR has said that the current restrictions on voting are contrary to the Convention, and the UK Supreme Court has noted that there is no reason to disagree with that, but it is ultimately for Parliament to decide whether or not to implement it.

Of course, if Parliament decides not to, the UK Government will be in breach of its obligations under the treaty and is already facing some 2,000 claims for compensation (which could go up to 90,000 in May, at the next election), but that's the Government's problem, not Parliament's - they signed up to a treaty, if they don't carry out their obligations under it there may be consequences.",0,1386952703,null,0,false,0,ce0wi5t,t3_1sspte,t1_ce0wi5t,t3_1sspte,null,1428148010,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Going with your statement from The End of Time Part 2 The Doctor would have been to Arcadia and taken the Moment and gone off world to the planet where he was trying to activate The Moment, thus disappearing to the High Council. 

It would then make sense that whilst he is being shown his future by The Moment, Rassilon could have been attempting the Final Sanction then as it is not clearly indicated how much time he spends in his future. When the War Doctor returns to use The Moment, The Moment then pulls 10 and 11 through the time lock and they think of their new plan. They head off to Gallifrey again. Then they announce to the War Council their intentions whereby the War Council indicate that the High Council's plans have failed anyway and allow the Doctor to carry out the plan.

If the War council were referring to other plans then the events of The End of Time would have to have pulled Gallifrey out of the Pocket Universe the Doctor put them in and not in fact from Gallifrey's natural orbit.

It appears as though someone asked the question if Dioufy would or wouldn't be involved on saturday. BM answered the question honestly stating no as he hadn't been in training via consent as he was attending the funeral of Nelson Mandela.

Bit of suggestion from yep/fans Dioufy hasn't been trying enough but his last Leeds game was eight games ago which seems like a lifetime but when you consider he's had two deaths one six days prior to a game during an international break (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Metsu) Who was buried on the 21st october, he'd missed pre-season training due to recovery from a shin infection meaning he couldn't of safely trained his legs over summer and then as he was returning to fitness/had played ninety minutes was featuring as sub he left for Bruno Metsu's funeral and comes back continues his training but the fit players have continued to gel meaning his fitness and talent needs to be more definite to be included. This is when Nelson Mandela dies and isn't to be buried till sunday.

I think what I'm getting at is although it seems like he hasn't been too involved that it's down to some very unfortunate circumstances and honourably and understandably BM is been fine with it, he seemed pretty chilled to me and I'm sure Dioufy would prefer to be paid to play rather than not. He get's a bad rap but with his experience and talent I'm quite certain even if he isn't at 100% he can be a positive influence on the remainder of our season and during training.

I would hope prior to January Diouf gets a chance to prove himself, puts in the training and get's some play time in. He featured heavily last season and I feel even at 10k if his experience and skill can rub off or keep people fighting for positions and to excel that it's probably worth letting it run out till end of the season or at least use it as a bone to encourage him and everyone else until then.",0,1386955116,null,0,false,0,ce0xjsd,t3_1sscx8,t1_ce0xjsd,t3_1sscx8,null,1428147521,3,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,3

true,bottomlines,null,null,"Well, I said satisfaction simply because so many other metrics are open to abuse. The Labour policies about A&amp;E waiting times spring to mind. Saying ""95% of people seen within 4hrs"" sounds great. But when a guy with a sprained ankle has been waiting 3hrs 55m because they've been busy with an emergency, should they take some doctors away from the emergency guy to see the ankle guy? The obvious answer is no, but what if they fuck up their stats, end up with &lt;95% success rate and their budget gets hammered next year? That might result in more patients not getting what they need. Neither is great, so I generally dislike the idea of hard targets and hard stats like wait times or survival rates because they are often misleading. Same with publishing surgeon success rates. Would that lead them to take less risky cases because they are worried about their stats?

Whereas I think patient satisfaction is quite important, because at the end of the day we pay for the NHS because we think it is worth paying for. And we deserve to be happy with what we pay for. If we all think it's shit then it probably is shit and we should start to question what we are paying for. Conversely, if we all love it, chances are they are doing a good job. That might be simplistic, but IMO satisfaction is a very simple but meaningful thing to measure.

For someone to be a confirmed rough sleeper someone from a partner organisation to the local authority must actually find them out, asleep, at night. A difficult task since most rough sleepers do not want to be found. Most Local Authorities will only do a snapshot which again doesnt paint a true picture.

Important to remember though, that rough sleeping isn't the same as being homeless.

Even if there is a 1% chance they are going to be not impartial they must step down and if they don't their decision can be over turned. 

In fact when it was being decided if General Pinochet should be extradited from the UK one of the judges had to step down from judging because he has involved in Amnesty International who had been arguing for his extradition. It was not apparent the judge was biased at all and he probably would have given a fair judgement but he *could* have been biased. The rules are so strict that you don't have to prove bias you just have to prove possible bias even if it's very unlikely.

true,yufl,null,null,"There are three orthogonal reasons I agree with it.  Firstly, if you look back through history at all the biggest injustices our government has been responsible for, quite a lot of them have involved wrongly imprisoning or otherwise punishing people, either because of a miscarriage of justice, or because what they did should not have been considered to be a crime in the first place, or because their crime was a form of protest against intolerable treatment by the government.  It's pretty easy to make the case that a lot of people in prison now should not be there - particularly the people serving sentences for possession of drugs or prostitution (or that poor guy who keeps being imprisoned for walking around the countryside naked).  People in that situation don't have many tools to try and change people's minds, and I think it is wrong to take away one of the few they do have.

Secondly, I'm always a bit queasy about allowing elected officials to make arbitrary decisions about who can or can't vote for them.  Look at the whole voter ID thing in the US - many state governments have made the very reasonable-sounding decision that, to reduce election fraud, voters should be required to show ID at the polls.  However, many of them have gone on to tweak their policies to use this as a tool to make it harder for their opponents to vote, for example by selectively closing down offices where people can obtain ID cards, or by only allowing the forms of ID that their supporters are more likely to own.  If we were to just come up with a simple rule and stick to it (every permanent resident over 16 is allowed to vote, for example), those kinds of shenanigans would be very difficult to pull off.

Thirdly, and this is more of an emotional thing than anything, I really like the concept of human rights, and the idea that we should only restrict them when there is a very good reason.  Imprisoning people is sometimes necessary to protect everyone else, but refusing people the right to vote doesn't really achieve anything except a feeling of retribution.  Human societies have often treated large groups of people appallingly for no real reason at all, and the concept of human rights seems to me to have been a very effective (though certainly imperfect) safeguard against this over the last few decades.",0,1386958495,null,0,false,0,ce0z162,t3_1sspte,t1_ce0z162,t1_ce0wdyt,null,1428146758,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

* There isn't really a pile to do up here, but it can be made bareable with a solid group of mates. Also, as you mentioned while responding to darkromanwine, University Of Ulster is split into 4 campuses. With Coleraine and Portstewart being away from more populated places like Belfast and Derry, you'll be seeing the same faces everywhere you go.

Looking at rocks is far more enjoyable when you aren't drenched head to toe with gale force winds blowing rain into your face from every direction.

true,notsoyoungpadawan,null,null,"&gt; I thought Martinez had expressed that he had no intentions of letting Baines leave just this past summer. Everton look like they have the endurance to actually maintain a European berth this season, whereas Moyes seems to be having some adjustment issues. They certainly have promise in Oviedo but he's 23, Baines is a leader in the LB slot. Why sell?

Its more the case of if Everton can afford to turn down a major bid. Baines is already 29 and I can see UTD making a ~¬£30m bid for him in desperation. They're in dire need of a signing that will lift a club and I feel like they will do everything they can to sign Baines.

&gt; I think a lot of people have drank the Matic kool-aid, so to speak. He's talented and has matured really well at Benfica. That being said, I read an article prior to the UEFA Cup final this past season in which Jesus attributed Chelsea swapping him with money for David Luiz as throwing a young Matic under the bus. He seemed critical of that, and now big European clubs (like Chelsea) are coming knocking for someone who could be ranked among the best CDM's in Europe.
I think Jorge Jesus is going to be unwilling to let the Primeira's player of the year go, at least cheaply. So I would expect Chelsea if they were to pick him up, to pay through the nose for him.
Then again, Benfica could just roll over and take money like most Portuguese clubs do when the big European institutions of football come looking for young talent.
I'm not an expert, just trying to break up the homogeneity of the Matic discussion a bit.

Thing is, Matic has already stated that if we went in for him again he would jump at the chance. The biggest pull we've got at the moment is Mourinho, and playing under him is a massive privilege for almost every player in the world. Seeing as this will be the case with Matic too, its not hard to imagine him asking for a move away from Benfica when we make a formal approach. A fee anywhere around the ¬£20m mark would be fair, but even if it goes up to ¬£25m I wouldn't care too much.

You can lie about a bunch of those criteria anyway if needs be. 

If you're consistently homeless in the UK then it's because you want to be. If London isn't giving you free housing then beg for a train fair and make your way to a different councils jurisdiction.

Therefore, if you want the cheapest coins, you should always check ALL 3:

1) LocalBitcoins (protip: Trusted sellers only)
2) BitBargain
3) BittyLicious

All of these sites (including ours) have pros and cons.

Pros:

- Localbitcoins: most volume
- BitBargain: choice in sellers
- BittyLicious: ease of use

Cons:

- Localbitcoins: risk of scam and the occasional delay in releasing coins
- BitBargain: limits (300 GBP / day), policies (a friend can't send the money for you etc)
- Bittylicious: no choice in sellers, limits

I would highly discourage anyone to say such a thing as ""Market1/Market2/Market3"" is cheaper or more expensive. It's always SOMEONE who is selling coins cheaper, and they always have a limited amount of coins. As far as I know all 3 markets take a 1% fee, so the rest is up to the sellers. Checking the right website at the right time can make all the difference in price.

https://bitbargain.co.uk/

For the record, prices at the time of writing this are:

- LocalBitcoins: 560 GBP (tomtheman2)
- BitBargain: 573.85 GBP (xferprotocal)

true,Matt5327,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"It may seem so - however when we fully analyze this, we find it's riddled with holes.

**Point 1:** A 13th incarnation of Smith is in direct contradiction to two occasions of Moffat's own writing - the Doctor's ""Death"" at lake Silencio, and his poisoning during *Let's Kill Hitler*. In the former, he begins regeneration (isn't surprised), and in the latter, he doesn't start regenerating (because of the poison, is surprised). Now, at first glance it may be easier to retcon these events; however, aside from their narrative purpose there is also further in-universe reasons this simply makes no sense.

**Point 2:** Now, we can't claim to understand Time Lord physiology. However, with a bit of general knowledge we can make some pretty good theories and rule other things out. The next few points will be focused on this. 

We know that the Doctor has 12 regenerations for 13 incarnations. We know he has two hearts (irrelevant to this discussion), and we know he has rapid healing abilities when in a self-induced coma. The Doctor mentions several times that regeneration is caused by a ""run-away effect."" A run-away of what? Probably his healing process for less serious conditions (whilst in a coma). However, this never impacts the incarnation limit, implying that *the quantity of regeneration energy is not the reason for the limit*.

**Point 3:** Physics this time! And still sorta physiology. Let's talk Regeneration Energy. Where does it come from? A reasonable conclusion would be the Time Vortex; it is what is responsible for the Time Lord's eventual ability to regenerate. Furthermore it cannot be something from from Gallifrey; how would River have the ability? It can't be passed on from parentage, because that means it would decrease with lineage. So again, Time Vortex. But the Doctor is always around it. This should lead to the logical conclusion that he is constantly filling with regeneration energy. Unless...

**Point 4:** The solution is that with each incarnation, he is capable of using less regeneration energy to heal himself. With so many new cells regeneration so quickly, it is reasonable to say that some things get messed up, and each time the available energy is lower and lower. This explains why earlier regenerations, such as Hartel to Troughton, and Troughton to Pertwee were less dramatic in comparison to, say, Davison to Colin. Especially why the latest require extra external energy. 

This also explains why the Master's 14th incarnation is so incredibly messed up. Had he simply run out of his finite quanty of regeneration energy, he would have been unable to regenerate. As it was, he regenerated but ran out before he could finish the process. 

**Point 5:** This one is brief. What causes the amount of regeneration energy a Time Lord can contain to drop? A large expenditure of energy,  or a new face? I would argue the latter; as the regeneration process itself is still at its core physiological, a direct change to whatever mechanism stimulates the process is necessary. This is only likely to change during a rapid, total overhaul - which leads us to conclude that Tennant's half-regeneration wouldn't count.

**Conclusion/TL;DR:** Although instinct may lend us to believe that Smith is the 13th for purposes of regeneration, a quick look at Moffat's other episodes as well as a thorough investigation into the nature of regeneration itself leads to the inevitable conclusion that a change of face is necessary to use an incarnation. Therefore, for the purposes of the regeneration limit, Smith is the 12th, and has yet one incarnation before the limit is reached.

A couple of advantages might be: we're less likely to get caught on the counter and it might throw off spurs' rather robotic style to face an unusual formation. I wonder if we're trying to copy west ham, who frustrated them with a packed midfield and defence then caught them out late on.

Why I don't like it:

Less pace to run in behind without sterling or attacking wide players in general. I thought the better idea would be for suarez to pull their defence forward while henderson and sterling made runs in behind from wide. This formation will tend to funnel everything through the central area where sandro, dawson, capoue/chiriches will block.

Spurs like to control the ball in central midfield and attack through wide men. Won't they exploit the space behind wingback and wide CB like arsenal did?

Presumably this is Coutinho further forward, ahead of a midfield three. I'd have preferred Coutinho deeper, playing early passes through their high line.

Flanagan is not a natural wingback, on the other hand he is a good covering fullback, balancing Johnson's attacking tendencies on the other side so we don't get caught out.

If Rose plays, Sterling destroyed him last year at sunderland. No Sterling to do that.

true,n3gotiator,null,null,"To the downvote brigade, here is my reasoning. You can agree with it, you can not agree with it, but I don't like Rose's attitude because he is very much against us getting a left back or being 2nd or rotational player. We have a 30 mil striker that sits on the bench when he's not performing and willingly joined a team that already had a 2-striker rotation for 1 spot.

Now, please see some quotes by Rose from pre-season:

""Obviously I know Spurs have been in the top four or five clubs for the last five seasons or so, so I know it's hard for anyone to break through, but at the same time it is frustrating and it's great that now the gaffer is not afraid to drop people if you're not performing or training hard enough."" (Referring to Benny's lack of playtime in friendlies)  - Shitty move to publicly talk about Benny getting dropped for not training hard enough. I get it, but that's not for the public to learn from a junior LB.

""I enjoyed every minute of it and now I've experienced it, coming here and sitting on the bench is not something I'd be looking to do."" (Speaking about coming from Sunderland back to Tottenham) - Again, easy now young fella... Spurs are shooting for top 4 and you want to have guaranteed first team? For what, playing well a season with Sunderland?

""I love this club, but if I don't play regularly then I'm not going to be happy, just like everyone else wouldn't be happy."" (Speaking at the end of last season / before the beginning of Pre-season friendlies)

We have 2-3 players for every position except LB. You won't play sometimes at a top club with proper bench, that's life. 

""Decent to see new young faces drafted into the England squad !! Looking forward to going somewhere next season and PLAYING some games !!!"" twitter post 

-- Back to recent times --

Rose has missed 17 games and played 6 this season. Here are his remarks...

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably something the gaffer and I will talk about but Kyle Naughton did very well against Sunderland and I‚Äôm not expecting to be taking his place at the weekend.‚Äù He then goes on to talk about 2 games where he'll be earning his spot back in. This rubs me as him trying to set an expectation of a timeline for re-joining the first team.

‚ÄúOf course that‚Äôs my job, and I would be the first one to find out if the club were looking to do that,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI thought the club were going to do that in August. I went to see the manager, sat down with him and he told me it was not true and that if the club was going to do that he would come and speak to me first-hand. - Really doesn't want to have another LB to compete with.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a lot of respect for the manager and he‚Äôs got a lot of respect for me. He treats me as one of the big players here and it‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve had that at this club.‚Äù""



I have no problem with Rose and I think he's improved a lot since he first played in pre-season, and I'm sure he'll be an important player for us. But he's a young left back who is just now starting to break into the first team, yet every time i see quotes, I get the impression that he expects to be easily slipped back as first choice.

We have Sig sitting on the bench, we have Ade in the shithouse despite misfiring Defoe and Soldado. Rose isn't a unique snowflake and I don't want him to stir up trouble in house and cause us to not sign another LB. Jan really doesn't play all that well there, and Naughton is RB cover, we need a left back, and Rose needs to be prepare for it and accept squad rotation. We're competing in 4 competitions.

I don't understand what you're saying here. The private prison is run for profit by definition. Each prisoner represents a consumer, for lack of a better term.

The prison will try to cut costs to maximize profit (I'm not saying this is good or bad). The state will try to save money by making contracts with cost-saving private prisons (again, I'm not saying this is good or bad). The unintended consequence of the privatization of the prison industry means that there is now an incentive to have more prisoners (eg. so the private prison can expand and make more money). This is why the prison industry hires lobbyists to make tougher laws. It was revealed that an anti-immigration bill passed in the US was written word-for-word by a prison industry lobbyist, who handed the bill off to legislators.

That is part of the problem. Thousands of years ago, we didn't understand all of the health consequences.

Today we have the science to engineer a safer alcohol alternative (that creates less addicts, causes no deaths, etc) but still provides the dis-associative-type effect that people associate with alcohol. Various scientists have proposed this (most recently by David Nutt) but most are completely ignored by the government for economic reasons.

I'm not thankful for something that causes more episodes of psychosis, violence, injury and death than any current known drug. ~23 people die every single day from this drug in the UK **alone** (Source: [ONS](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/subnational-health4/alcohol-related-deaths-in-the-united-kingdom/2011/alcohol-related-deaths-in-the-uk--2011.html)).

Hazard-Mata-KDB

Eto'o

With Luiz fit, him and Terry are my favorite pairing. With Bertrand still injured I'd like Cole to start, though with only 1 game back and coming off of injury I'd like him to be fresh for Arsenal. I don't see Palace coming out to play us, so we need a lot of quality on the ball to dissect their defense. Oscar playing further back can help give us tempo, and defend well if needed. Hazard's in form and has the ability to do something special, with Mata and KDB providing incisive passing and setpiece delivery. Eto'o is probably our best striker playing against defensive sides, and hasn't playing for a few.

There's also a second tool the Government can use in some cases called the [Queen's Consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Consent) (also Prince's Consent), whereby neither House of Parliament will debate a bill that affects the powers etc. of the Crown without the Queen's (or in some cases, Prince Charles's) permission. This has been used by Governments to block debates of bills affecting their powers that they didn't like - it was last used in 1999 to block a bill that would have required Parliamentary approval before the Government could take military action against Iraq.

In practice, assent is usually given in the form of a letter sent to the Speakers of both Houses, signed by the Queen. My understanding is that a letter is sent from the relevant department to the Queen (or her lawyers), with ""advice"" from the Government telling her to sign it or not.

5 CBs for a team like ours isn't overkill, our midfield on the other hand is saturated. 

For me, Ivan isn't a RB, he's a WC CB (And don't bring in Jose, I couldn't give a toss what he thinks). Too many times Ivan loses the challenge on that side, he's not consistent on the attack down the right (and his balls into the box are terrible).

eta: found details. It was a life sentence on a 7 year tariff. The only reason he is still in prison is that he refused to admit guilt:

http://www.mojuk.org.uk/MOJUK2012/VictorNealon.html
&gt; Events began in the early hours of 9 August 1996 when Kim Lovett, who was out celebrating her 22nd birthday, was assaulted in the centre of Redditch, Worcestershire. The attacker jumped on her and pushed her to the ground but she resisted and, fortunately, he ran off.

&gt; She and a friend had just left a club, Racquets, and there were a number of people in the vicinity. Witnesses realised that the attacker, who was wearing a distinctive patterned shirt, was the same man who had been in the club earlier in the evening. The doorman remembered admitting him; he recalled that the man had a Scottish accent.

&gt; More importantly, all the witnesses were unanimous on one key point. The man had a prominent physical feature: a lump on his forehead. One witness described this as ‚Äúnatural‚Äù; no one suggested that it was a temporary bump that could have been the result of accident or injury.

&gt; Six weeks later, Nealon, a 36-year-old Irishman, was arrested for the attack. He did not have a lump on his forehead.

&gt; He agreed to give forensic samples and also to stand on an identification parade. The victim‚Äôs friend did not pick him out. The club doorman did not pick him out. Two women who served the attacker at a burger bar (one of whom provided a particularly good description) did not pick Nealon out. And the victim herself? The police didn‚Äôt even ask her to attend the parade.

&gt; However, a barmaid picked Nealon out and so did a club-goer, sort of (he was, he said, ‚Äúunsure, though it was possibly No.3 [Nealon]‚Äù).

&gt; That was all ‚Äì although afterwards one witness was beckoned over by the investigating police officer. The witness then said he‚Äôd thought all along it was No.3 but, being naturally indecisive, he hadn‚Äôt said so at the time.

&gt; So then Nealon was charged.

&gt; In his defence, he said that he didn‚Äôt go to nightclubs, and didn‚Äôt even know where Racquets was. He couldn‚Äôt remember precisely what he‚Äôd been doing at the time, but would probably have been at home with his partner, Maria, and her daughter, Lisa.

&gt; In the bizarre logic of the legal system, to have stayed at home on a Thursday evening and watched television with your family is a deeply unimpressive alibi ‚Äì despite the fact that that is exactly what the majority of the adult population would have been doing.

&gt; However, Maria realised that Lisa kept a diary. According to this, on that day, Nealon had gone to the video rental shop and taken out videos of Lock Up and The Shawshank Redemption, which they watched that evening.

&gt; At the end of the trial, after the defence case had closed, the judge allowed the prosecution to introduce rebuttal evidence. According to this, the films Nealon had taken out that evening were actually three comedies, rather than the dramas that Lisa had noted down.

&gt; So the trial ended with the prosecution having produced a coup de gr√¢ce to knock out the defence case. Nealon was given a life sentence with a seven-year tariff.

Paulinho

Chiriches

Capoue

Eriksen

Chadli

Lamela 

Soldado

Paulinho gets the nod first because he's played the most, and played well for the most part.  AVB seems to rate him more than I do, but that said I rate him pretty highly.

Chiriches has stepped up very well in light of Vert being forced out left, and looks to be a good bet in terms of being a long term started at CB.

Capoue has been hurt, otherwise he might be a bit higher.  But he's filled in admirably at CB as well, and looked very comfortable early in the year.

Chaldi hasn't been around much either, but looks solid whenever he's around.

Both Soldado and Lamela have been limited in their impact for us, so it's basically a toss up.  Some very good performances in the EL, but not much else. I'll freely admit that I'm probably a little biased towards the Argentine here.

Edit:  Forgot my reasoning for Eriksen.  Honestly, it's not his fault I don't have him first.  Our inability too score in the league until recently is more in spite of him than because of him in my opinion.  Our best scoring form came with him hurt too.  I have no doubts that he'll be top very soon.

Other Edit:  For the hell of it, I'll add my list for *best*.  A bit more forward thinking:

Eriksen

Chiriches

Lamela

Paulinho

Capoue

Soldado

Chadli

For this one, the potential of those first three wins out, and I just listed them in order of how big I think their impact will be by the end of the season.  Paulinho and Capoue seem to be very good players, who can perform a few important roles.  Soldado, who I think will fix his confidence/finishing issues going forward, is still a great signing of course.  But he is the oldest of our signings.  Chadli seems like he'll be a good role player, but unlike the rest of these guys, I just don't see him as a potential starter.  Capoue is the other guy who fits that description, but I put him higher because of versatility.  

I know OP wasn't necessarily asking for this, but someones comment below about how Paulinho shouldn't be #1 made me want to differentiate between impact so far, and how important I think these guys are or will be.",0,1386967273,null,0,1386979825,0,ce12ukq,t3_1stiig,t1_ce12ukq,t3_1stiig,null,1428144977,19,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,19

Chiriches - another immediate impact guy, I think Dawson is a great lockerroom leader but he just doesn't have the pace.

Capoue - We had a big problem getting the ball to the attacking players last year without modric and his passing ability is breath of fresh air. However we already have some depth when it comes to the center midfield.

Lamela - Hasn't had the greatest impact, seems to have moments of brilliance, but has incredible potential.

Soldado - To be fair I had never seen him play before he came to Spurs, but I really thought we could use a guy who could win headers and hold up play. Doesn't mean he isnt an improvement and not a great striker. Just hasn't made an immediate impact.

Chadli - He not the fastest, not the most skillful, doesn't have the greatest vision, but he is solid in every one of those areas. Hasn't really had any standout moments of the season since we have so many wingers rotating, but has put in some great shifts.

They still had to implant the thoughts in the Master's head from their location inside the Time Lock, so it did break it, which is a massive logic flaw. I've never heard that thing about them being able to manipulate the Vortex whenever they want, where did that come from?

Name of the Doctor, fine, I see your point about the paradoxical loop, but I don't see that as anything approaching a cop-out ending. It lent masses of new significance to the show's history, which means everything going forward had a new context. That is most definitely a lasting effect.

The plot of the Day of the Doctor set up a whole new long-term story of him searching for Gallifrey. To say that the plot had nothing to do with anything AND to suggest that a character piece for the show's main character isn't a massive, significant story is, at best, yet to be proven. If the show permanently ends and they never mention Gallifey again, I'll admit you were right on this point.

He doesn't ""like to pretend"" anything, he just hasn't done many stories about the entire population of Earth in the 21st century. That, like big, emotional stories, was Davies' schtick, and Moffat's been absolutely right to not tread on that - a stylistic change with a new writer is how the show's endured.

The one thing I'll agree with you on is the point about the Zygons feeling like a backdrop, but I think stuff like that is done to leave threads dangling for the future. That's frustrating sometimes, but it's symptomatic of Davies' ""the Daleks have been absolutely and completely defeated OH NO here they are again somehow"" habit.

I don't think anyone would argue against Paulinho for the top spot, he's just been terrific.  Chiriches has also played really well and has filled in quite nicely with all the injuries to the backline.  Soldado is our leading goalscorer in the PL and I think the team looks best when he's on the pitch.  Capoue and Eriksen was a toss up for me but I put Capoue just slightly ahead because of how great he's been filling in at CB for us.  Finally Chadli and Lamela have not seen the pitch as much, but I think both have great potential to be impact players not just in the distant future but later this season.

First, he retcons the Master's previous reason for being evil (that his choices led him down that path) with a badly written timelord-induced mental illness. He got rid of the Master's real goals with the motivation of 'because I'm crazy'.

He sets Moffat up to fail by making sure his run begins with Tennant crying like a kid with sand in his eyes because he couldn't resist trying to jerk out a few more tears.

He changes regeneration from 'the Doctor keeps going, albeit in a new body' to 'it's like he dies', once again, riling the fans up against Smith before he gets out of the gate.

He kept dragging back Rose, forcing romance plots, and he wrote Tennant as annoyingly whiny and self-righteous. It wasn't like 10 was a better character due to being flawed, because he would need some good qualities as well.

The only good stories he wrote were Midnight and Gridlock. The best stories were written by Moffat, the only whose stories Davies didn't extensively rewrite.

The worst part is... it just wasn't Doctor Who. JNT may have been awful, and Moffat may write a convoluted story about thrice a season, but at least their runs are true to the overall show.

true,BrambleBees,wales-denbighshire,Denbighshire,"&gt; I think you're trying to blame women for something that is obviously a much wider problem.

I already said in no uncertain terms that I do *not* blame women because I knew someone would suggest that sooner or later.  Doesn't it seem a little absurd to you that men can't try to discuss gender politics without someone telling them they have a problem with women?  I understand the utility of trying to read between the lines, but when that interpretation directly contradicts what the *actual* lines say maybe it's best to leave it aside.  You don't know enough about me to try and interpret my motives.

I tried to examine your link but unfortunately it goes nowhere.

If women are being paid less than minimum wage then a law is being broken and we have systems in place to deal with that.  The fact that people are willing to *try* and pay women less is certainly a problem if true but you can't legislate what people *want* to do - that kind of social development takes a little more time.  If they are called to account for breaking the law they will, presumably, stop.

As for retail, I have no data to hand but in my experience in retail (10 years) women quite significantly outnumber men at all levels of store employment, so from sales assistants to managers.  Above that I wouldn't really know from personal experience, but I can certainly believe it's mostly men.  Obviously that's an anecdote but the few data sources I could find from a quick Google search say the split is around 60/40 in favour of women at the store level.

(And of course I didn't literally mean mining, just that men are generally considered unworthy specimens if they're not willing or able to undertake hard labour.)

Also (and this may just be a tactical issue) I don't like him playing deep/ partnered with Dembele; he is very much a sideways player and has a bit of Dempsey in him (slows down attacks mightily, as well as being good for a wasteful shot at least twice a game) he's actually sort of limited technically as well, his touch is pretty inconsistent.""

Again, I only read what Jorge Jesus said back in May (or whenever it was) and the tone of the article made it sound like the club would fight tooth and nail to keep him if not make him leave for a ridiculous sum.

Here are the quotes: 
http://espnfc.com/news/story/_/id/1586360/nemanja-matic-interested-chelsea-return?cc=4716

&gt; I forgot about Baines age. I'm curious if there would be backlash if Moyes spent an absurd amount of money on a 29 year old left back, even if he's great. Not only that but the only two signings Moyes would have made in his tenure thus far would be two guys from his old club of all places. It's off topic though.

He probably won't suffer much backlash. The hype surrounding Baines is quite massive at the moment, especially given his set-piece ability and the fact that he is English.

&gt; I'm just amazed that Southampton could command a ¬£20m+ fee for Shaw at age 18. I guess when you consider all the factors (age, position, he's English...) it makes it worthwhile.

To be fair, he is an amazing talent, and the fact that he's a big Chelsea fan only helps our cause. But anyway, Southampton have several players they could end up selling for decent fees in the next few years. It was interesting watching Jose's press conference today, though. When they asked him if we were interested in Shaw he said no, but it was an EXTREMELY hesitant no, almost to the point where it looked like he wanted to say yes but changed his mind at the last moment.

OK, here's the thing: the porn filter policy has [already come into effect](http://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2013/11/uk-isp-sky-broadband-launch-network-level-internet-filtering-service.html). Did you notice? No, because all it means is that if you sign up for a new internet connection, there is a tick box on the form that asks if you want parental control filtering. Whether that tick box is checked by default or not is so incidental it's not even worth talking about. Secondly, this isn't even a governmental filter. It's a measure the government asked the ISPs to voluntarily take. The ISPs are responsible for determining what goes on the filter lists. Yes, it's perfectly possible that the Labour party website might get filtered by this, if the ISPs are absolutely atrocious at their job. So the simple solution is, you opt out.

&gt; Also, the 'slippery slope' isn't a fallacy when the next hypothetical step is a logical and realistic one 

So we have an optional parental control (that, let's face it, every household in the country is going to opt out of), and we have the taking down of copyright infringing websites. In what mad world is the next logical step to either of those to dispose of the concept of free speech entirely and bring in a regime of silencing dissenting opinions?

The survival mechanism would be the regeneration process bringing out the traits that would most help the Doctor live through the situation that almost killed him. For instance, the meta-crisis doctor was ""borne out of bloodshed"" and hence, more prone to violent solutions (and of course the ""fighting hand"" gag that suddenly turned 10 into a sword fighter..) When 10 regenerated, he was bitter about how unable to help others he felt. His last moments were spent giving people extravagant gifts, meddling in ways he wasn't really supposed to. 11's predominant personality traits seemed to carry on from that.

The random restructuring would be all the memories and tastes and sounds and experiences hes absorbed over the years being shuffled around. He's still the same man, but suddenly the 4th doctor remember his enjoyment of jelly babies, or the 11th just cant help but reminisce about how cool those bow ties are. It's childish and a bit erratic because its brought to the foreground without all the social buffering we build up through adolescence into adulthood. All these traits were there, but in their proper place and the more he regenerates the more ""tawdry quirks"" he picks up. This may be why there is a limit of 12 imposed.

true,SoopahFreek90,eng-yorkshire,Glorious Yorkshire,"&gt; OK, here's the thing: the porn filter policy has already come into effect. No, because all it means is that if you sign up for a new internet connection, there is a tick box on the form that asks if you want parental control filtering.

These parental measures already existed before Cameron made any moves towards wanting to filter the internet. The ISPs simply made them more obvious to appease Cameron's and the so-called moral guardian's hair-brained attempts at ""protecting the children"". However Cameron wants to take it further. Cameron wants it that the internet is filtered full stop, with no tick-boxes when you first sign-up, and if you do want your service to be unfiltered you need to subsequently contact the ISP directly and request that they make it so.

&gt; So we have an optional parental control (that, let's face it, every household in the country is going to opt out of), and we have the taking down of copyright infringing websites. In what mad world is the next logical step to either of those to dispose of the concept of free speech entirely and bring in a regime of silencing dissenting opinions?

Well, David Cameron has expressed desire and intent to make possessing pornography depicting rape punishable by law. Rape porn, while distasteful is perfectly legal as long as those performing in it are consenting adults who are simply acting. Cameron has made no distinction as to whether or not he wants to make owning simulated rape porn illegal, or real rape porn, which means he intends to make owning legal content punishable by law in a blanket-approach.

true,todd360,null,null,Basically when the Doctor meets himself the universe sort of self rights itself around him. As the Doctor has said in the past by and large paradoxes tend to resolve themselves. Anytime the Doctor meets himself is a monumental paradox but again as the Doctor says he has time traveled more than anyone else so its a rather natural type of paradox. The simplest way for the universe to resolve the paradoxes caused by this is to simply de-sync the Doctor's timeline so only the latest incarnation involved in events can remember them afterward. If an earlier incarnation were to remember they could completely change their actions when they live the event as the later incarnation and pretty much turn the safe paradox into a nuke. In instances like Time Crash however its the Doctor's specific recall of the event that solves the problem which kind of throws a wrench into the works. In that case it could be that the universe denies him the knowledge right until it is required. Ultimately the universe is going to do what's easiest to rectify any paradoxes and is effectively going to be winging it in most cases i would think.

true,badwornthing,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; Cameron wants it that the internet is filtered full stop, with no tick-boxes when you first sign-up, and if you do want your service to be unfiltered you need to subsequently contact the ISP directly and request that they make it so.

Respectfully, you are wrong on this (which, honestly, is hardly surprising given the number of alarmist opinion pieces on the matter which get posted to Reddit). [Here's a source](http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-07/22/government-porn-filters):
&gt; UK prime minister David Cameron has announced that by the end of 2014, every household with internet access will have to choose whether they want to remove porn filters, which will otherwise be automatically switched on. New internet customers will have to choose during setup whether they want to remove or adjust the filters, which will be ticked ""yes"" by default. Meanwhile, existing customers will be asked through a ""browser intercept"" whether they want to turn porn filters off.

It's really not that big of a deal. Hell, all the mobile networks have had an opt-out porn block by default for years and no one really cared. Nothing's being censored. You can still access anything legal. You just turn it off.

&gt; Cameron has made no distinction as to whether or not he wants to make owning simulated rape porn illegal, or real rape porn, which means he intends to make owning legal content punishable by law in a blanket-approach.
Combine this with the Government's constant calls for the UK to pull out of the European Court of Human Rights, and their crackdowns on means of protest, I'd say we are on a particularly slippery slope.

Now these are good points, and are indeed awful things the government is doing. It's still slippery slope reasoning, but it's at least less of a leap than from taking down illegal websites to criminalising political opposition.",0,1386980140,null,0,false,0,ce17vv7,t3_1ss87o,t1_ce17vv7,t1_ce16xcp,null,1428142560,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

This is why I couldn't be arsed with teenage relationship drama, because what you've described is precisely what was happening.  People would start going out with each other up because of peer pressure.

It's absolutely fine to be single at any age, if you're happy.  Relationships can be a massive fucking hassle, especially when you're a naive and emotionally volatile teenager and when you have more important things to worry about like passing exams and gaining qualifications.

true,fidelcabro,,Yard of overproof rum.,"I don't mean if you want a burger you should have to go out and kill a cow or bull. I think that people should know where the meat comes from and if it came to it they should respect the fact it has to be killed and that it is an animal. I have no problems with hunting for food, I enjoy game. If I could I would hunt my own venison.

What I think it comes down to is knowledge. I remember as a kid seeing my grandfather butchering rabbits, and when I was older we would fish together and I would learn how to prepare those. The problem with buying pack of meat is you never see what it has come from, I am not that old and I remember seeing butchers with sides of meat on display. In very few places do you see that and it is a shame.

Yes the world has moved on and neither you or I have to kill or prepare our own meat. Given the chance I would, I know basic butchery from my time in a kitchen (cooking being something else I think more children and young people should know about). 

Ah I am lacking in sleep, a bottle of rum down and rambling because I am alone and the cricket isn't on until two. 

It is like the thing other day on here, what strange foods have you eaten. I don't see the problem in trying something. It is the way we learn if something is nice or not. Veal in this country has a very bad reputation but due to the law now veal crates are illegal and they get to prance around a field before they get turned into tasty meat. (Which is much better than being shot a day after birth because they are a bull and not neeeded on a dairy farm). We need to embrace our bovine and porcine friends and realise that they may look nice but they are also tasty.

All we know so far about how River knows the Doctor's name:

&gt; RIVER: Well, I know it.

&gt; CLARA: What, you know his name? He told you?

&gt; RIVER: I made him.

&gt; CLARA: How?

&gt; RIVER: It took a while. 

Surely this is the set-up to a really good episode. We also have this from later
on:

&gt; RIVER: Oh, there's one more thing.

&gt; DOCTOR: Isn't there always?

&gt; RIVER: I was mentally linked with Clara. If she's really dead, then how can I still be here?

&gt; DOCTOR: Okay, how?

&gt; RIVER: Spoilers. Goodbye, sweetie. 

If, as you say, the Doctor brought some sort of program with him that was tied
to her brainwaves, he wouldn't need to ask how she was still there, and she
wouldn't claim that the answers were spoilers.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;This is you taking your own prejudice, and assuming you're correct

No, it isn't - there's no need to start playing the victim just because you haven't provided evidence. Where do I say anywhere 'well what do you expect from travellers?' And it's not really detracting from the problem you now have where for all the text below, you've not provided what was really needed - some links. And to cap it off you're complaining that not providing evidence influences an opinion without your permission.

&gt;To answer, yes that sounds like a human thing to do and I refuse to lump all travellers together the way you have and assume they all don't while everyone else does.

I haven't lumped them together - I've just pointed out that nobody's provided any examples of note. You are actually highlighting a connection and then blaming it on my supposed prejudice.

&gt;You've openly used a lack of evidence as evidence itself which is a dangerous way to go. You're waiting for evidence to come to you (or google) rather than actually looking for it in an unbiased way.

No, it isn't, because so much evidence is available from all sort of groups, areas and peoples around the UK, whether it's from themselves or reported on by the media; - you'd have a point if there was no charity info about anyone, but that's not the case is it? Sorry, but as I said in my earlier post, several people have taken this before (and then taken offence when they're asked to back up their defence. I'm getting deja-vu here).

&gt;Because that's not how travellers work, there is no ""travellers of Essex"", individuals and families mingle and split all the time. 

So...nobody stayed at Dale Farm, then? And they have mass gatherings for trade, etc. - why is it so hard to organise something there?

&gt;Where is your donation for xyz street residents charitable organisation?

Er...you are aware that when you donate to many sites on the web they keep your email/ contact details on record, right? And that people tend to publish that kind of thing on FB when they donate?

&gt;No you're not thinking big enough, how do you know that not a single traveller does exactly the same?

If your group raises money of any real size, or collects clothes that have to be shipped abroad, any number of issues where money has to be spent, you donate it to your chosen cause as a registered charity, for several reasons (tax relief, paper trail etc,). Are you suggesting that Travellers do all of this secretly somehow?

&gt;If there is no Google evidence that you do it, perhaps the same applies to other people.

Unless of course they wear the t-shirt. Or post it on FB. Or twitter. Or the local paper... Considering so many areas are part of their charity name (did you search Carlilse?), where are the traveller ones?

&gt;Not everyone's financial history is freely available online. You've made an assumption and using the gaps knowledge as affirmation of your own beliefs again.

See above.

&gt;We don't know who belongs, runs or donates to most charities. Just because it's not stamped ""run by travellers"" it's not right to assume it's run by bricks and mortar men in suits. 

See above above. 

&gt;There are traveller-run registered charities.

Such as?

&gt;Just because you can't find them, it doesn't mean they don't exist.

How many secret registered charities are there? Even the *masons* are publicly registered - they have to be.

&gt;The thing is that because they're individual human beings and don't judge an entire people on the actions of a few.

Try that last part the other way round - if even a few were doing it in a way found it's way onto a website (which is pretty much everything), we wouldn't be having this discussion. Would every traveller charity be prominently listed? Of course not. But *none at all...?*

&gt;Maybe no evidence exists that a traveller has returned a dropped handbag or helped someone cross the road, this stuff doesn't make the news and isn't documented, it doesn't mean it doesn't happen.

Now you're down to giving the same example I was given before. Helping the odd old person cross the road is something the majority will do anyway. Fundraising charity is much bigger, so less people do it but still in significant enough numbers to be easily researched. 

And so the fifth time this conversation has ended in exactly the same way.

true,theblondereaper,mcgann,McGann,"NOTE: Although I am a massive Whovian (It is a large part of my personal and professional life) the following is of course, open to interpretation. This is simply my view on the process of Regeneration, and while much of it is stated fact, some is assumed and well-informed opinion.

Ok, Regeneration is actually a quite varied topic. Canonical regeneration does vary from Time Lord to Time Lord. Some have innate control over it, whereas others have no control. Because of this, some Time Lords barely change from one Regen to the next, whilst others can go from your best bud to completely unstable. Also, a level of control is always only a rule of thumb guide per Time Lord, as somebody who has great control over the process, can also find that once or twice in their 12, they end up losing it completely. This is why the council temporarily suspend any member post their regen, to be reinstated after passing a medical.

Also, just because somebody has great control over the process doesn't always mean that they will CHOOSE to remain the same mentally.

Regeneration can sometimes be manually triggered, by both the intended participant, or the council of the Time Lords on the participants behalf. It is not known whether the council can control a subjects regeneration when they trigger it.

Certain aspects of Regeneration can be incepted through various means. It is highly suspected that Borusa's regeneration in The Five Doctors was tampered with, causing him to become unstable. He also used his influence within the council to avoid a post regeneration check, to avoid his illegal intentions (and unstable mind) from being discovered.

We also recently saw the Eighth Doctor trigger his regeneration from drinking a concoction which cemented his new forms physical and mental attributes, thanks to the advancement of Time Lord Science within the Sisterhood of Karn, on the planet Karn.

There is often debate about Romana's on screen Regeneration, where she ""tries out"" several bodies in the mirror before settling. This has not been retconned, and instead it is considered by most that she has one of the highest levels of control ever seen by a Time Lord. During almost any regeneration, there is a time span before the process shuts down. This is how the Tenth Doctor grew his extra hand, and how Romana was able to rejig her entire physical appearance.

Ok, so now we know a lot about some of the various differences of regeneration and how they can differ within different Time Lords. Lets focus on The Doctor.

The Doctor has a subconcious level of control over his regeneration, for the most part. Whilst he can't tailor it himself, his regeneration gives him what he needs most of the time. Examples of this are:

The Sixth Doctor assumed the appearance of Commander Maxil, a Time Lord with which he'd had altercations with in his previous life. It's often considered that at the beginning stages of 5's regeneration, his life is flashing before his eyes, so to speak. He speaks of Adric, and as Commander Maxil was one of the few people ever to shoot The Doctor, it's probable he was in The Doctors subconcious at a late point in the process, as getting shot has connections with death.

The Tenth Doctor was able to interrupt a regeneration, something very difficult to achieve, because he didn't want to change.

The Tenth Doctor also towards the end of his life, suffered from a great depression that he could no longer hide. This was ongoing throughout the Waters of Mars, The End of Time and more. His regeneration into the Eleventh Doctor made him energetic, lively, eccentric. A child like Whimsical personality, that countered the depression from his previous form.

Deep down, since Events of the 50th Anniversary, The Doctor has had to bury memories of his ""War Doctor"" incarnation, one which lived to be very old, and who he believed did a terrible thing, which took a great deal of responsibility. Responsibility is for grown ups, and since then we had:

9 (Christopher Eccleston) - Not completely young, but his regeneration began just as complex space-time events which would affect The Doctors memory were drawing to a close. He could afford to be a little older, but still reasonably youthful, as he's only just in the process of forgetting real events and imagining false ones. Fresh from The Last Great Time War, he also remains slightly militant.

10 (David Tennant) - Much Younger. The events occuring during his last regeneration are no longer ongoing, and The Doctor truly believes his ""War Doctor"" incarnation destroyed Gallifrey. Embroiled in more war throughout this life, as he regenerates, he subconciously realises he needs to lighten up a little, but also, take on a younger personality, to avoid growing up.

11 (Matt Smith) - Again, we've already discussed the depression that brought on this incarnation. But the key point here is he still doesn't want to grow up.

12 (Peter Capaldi) - Physically, he is far older again, older than he's ever been ""fresh out of the box"" Whilst I can't comment too much on what I know about Capaldi, we have been promised a far more world weary, slightly more assertive Doctor. This suggests that as the Eleventh Doctor knows now of the real events around the closing of The Time War, and has forgiven himself, he is willing to grow older once more, and accept that responsibility.

Other stuff:

The Doctor has suffered Amnesia post regeneration, in his seventh &amp; eighth incarnation. Whilst the Amnesia in his seventh incarnation was induced by The Rani, it was possibly due to his fresh regeneration that helped make The Doctor so susceptible, as other attempts at this have failed.

Occasionally, Time can ripple back, and influence Regeneration. It has been noted that prior to his existence, the seventh Doctors personality influenced the Sixth Doctor's actions; he forced the ""colourful jester"" to purposely steer the TARDIS into the Rani's tractor beam, so a defender of Time could be born. Also so that he could avoid the creation of the Valeyard. He later discovered that the latter half of this may have been a delusion. [REAL WORLD HERE: To keep the possibility of The Valeyard open for future use in the series]

Not quite a regeneration, but Donna could hear the Meta Crisis Doctors heartbeat before she created him. This was part of the influence that made Donna create him in the first place. This is another example of space-time events rippling back.


Ok, I've been working on this for a long time now. I've probably missed loads. I'll pop back with more if I discover it. If you have any questions, ask me, and I'll do my best with them :)

But aside from wages, debt and home ownership just about every single metric you can imagine is positive and rising, I'd rather not have to source that comment at nearly 2am in the morning, but lets just say that generally we're *okay*.

The two problems we have are that we're moving into a period of technological advancement and economic misadventure. Jobs are moving overseas today, in 10-25 years they'll be moving onto silicon and robotics and then both us **and** the developing world will share a common issue. And the economic systems of most if not all developed / western countries that revolve around financial services that have little real-world relevance and little purpose other than nonproductive profit will also in 10-25 years find that those jobs too will be automated and require no economically significant *human* intervention (as in jobs). If they still exist that is. one can dream.

Very relavent TED talk by Andrew McAfee; ""What will future jobs look like?"": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXQrbxD9_Ng

That said I kinda agree with what you said about climate change in developing countries, there are a lot of countries around the world currently being eyed by global industries as cheap labor that are going to be absolutely fucked within a century by climate change, sea level rise and ocean acidification. And now to revert to my normal pessimistic self; I'd just say if you're under 30 then don't buy property on the east coast.

Following your analogy, what you are taking about - examination on entry - is about stopping the horse from leaving the stable in the first place. Which I have no problem with. I'm fully in support of an English test on entry in principle. 

What I am taking about is what to do once the horse has already escaped the stable. It's now running around outside and you need to get it under control. 

Cutting immigrants already in country who already struggle with poor English off from any financial support and not helping them to improve their English to get employed is going to drive them to crime and illegal employment. This will lead to all sorts of knock on problems down the road and they will never be able to integrate or contribute positively to the UK. 

To force it into the analogy, it's like shooting the horse dead. You've solved the issue of a wild horse on the loose very quickly and easily, but now it's dead and you're going to have to clean up the mess. You've also lost any potential benefit you could have got from owning a healthy horse.

Instead, wouldn't it be better to try and tame the horse? It'll take a lot more effort but it will allow you to guide it back into the stable and use it another day as a racer or show horse or pack animal, whatever. 

Provide some support to make them employable and you've got a useful worker on your hands. How much does it cost to teach sometime basic English? How much will they contribute in taxes once they are employed?

It's not like i'll take in an artist and just sit and wait for something to happen. There is already trusted contacts that I'll pitch my artists and get an easy head start on their careers. 

I don't have industry wide contacts, but the people I work with dont limit themselves to a specific genre. I'm at a level where my decisions with any act that is considered 'safe' in their respected genre. Can be looked in to be invested in. However I won't be looking for bands in their extreme of thei genre. 

Diversity is still a thing and because of the size if the industry you can still be successful without being niche. Everyone knows everyone. 

Once you're at the top of your game, industry wide contacts care definitely much a plausibility. Think of Jason Flom if you know him. The music industry is very small. Even speaking globally. I'm not yet at a level that I know everyone but its very much possible.

Too often we dismiss players so quickly and are so eager to play football manager and tinker with teams and transfers (I'm to blame for this as well) but I think we must take the long view of this.

Spurs are showing that signing several teams doesn't ensure instant success. I'd rather create a *team.* And I think that is what Rodgers is building. And we'll need *all* of center-backs (Agger, Sakho, Skrtel, Toure, and even Coates and Kelly) over the next couple seasons if we're going to grab a Champions League spot, play well in the Champions League, play well in our domestic Cup matches and finish in the Top 4 yet again.

I know I've looked too far ahead already but I'm already excited for December 2014 when Rodgers says so-and-so was rash and made mistakes but is now arguably the best player at his position in the Premier League.

I didn't mean a literal nuclear bomb.  The Moment's description as a galaxy eater gives no insight into what The Moment actually is, so we're left with a bomb that blows up an entire galaxy.  After the writers introduced Davros' Reality Bomb (which was maniacal and brilliant, by the way), I expect other ultimate weapons to be similarly awesome.  The weapons don't have to destroy the whole of reality to impress me; they have to be creative in their mechanism and awesome in their power.

I'm not upset that there was a happy ending.  The special **had** to have one.  I'm upset that Moffat erased the new-Who Doctor's defining feature: his darkness.

true,WhosMagicBus,null,null,"&gt; The thing about the 50th is it wasn't about the Time War, it was about the Doctor's redemption. The scenes that were shown were filler to set the background.

Disagree.  The Doctor was healed by Rose.  To me, the 50th was the bridge between old-Who and new-Who, and was supposed to explore or explain at least some of the Time War.  Who or What started it and why?  Why was the Doctor's only option to commit double genocide?  If he just couldn't take the war anymore, he could have just run away, but he chose to annihilate both sides.  There must have been other consequences to the war -- things that had to be stopped, ""in the name of peace and sanity"".

&gt; This is a show that has spanned decades despite often looking like it was filmed in somebody's basement for much of the early series.

I know -- I've been watching since the Tom Baker era.  I love those old episodes with their bad effects and cheesy synth music.

if we have a chance to sign a LB like Rodriguez, Alex Sandro, or even Oczipcka then we should take it, and have them duel it out. If Rose isn't happy AGAIN then he can jog on as he isn't good enough to keep to 1 position because he gets unhappy that he doesn't play games.

You said you started with Baker elsewhere - does it truly matter that the Doctor has had some character development and can now move past his darkness and somewhere else? Regardless of this happening or not, he'd have to move past it eventually, one man can not sit in darkness forever.

It's a shitty situation he is in. Does he live at home/with parents? As well as looking into hardship funds (try the awarding uni/college involved in his apprenticeship scheme) and CAB advice, perhaps sitting down and looking at his finances with him might help. As a late teen I had a very unrealistic view of what sensible budgeting and spending was. Are there any ways he can reduce his outgoings?  We all want to be able to go out drinking or indulge in our hobbies, be that sport or computers/ gaming or whatever. Maybe you can help him streamline or prioritize his spending or create some reward based goals to focus on for saving/reducing spending.
