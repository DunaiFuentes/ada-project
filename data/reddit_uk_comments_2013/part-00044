*Purely speculatively*, I'd suspect it'd resolve like this:

* ""Great Offices"": Home Secretary, Chancellor, Defence, Foreign Office, Justice Secretary
* Other Secretaries of State
* Secretaries of State that sit in the Lords -- under the Brown Government, Peter Mandleson was explicitly First Secretary of State which made him the second-in-command in the nuclear issue.
* Ministers of State in the Commons
* Ministers of State in the Lords
* MPs
* Civil Service/emergency direct rule by the Queen, who is by all accounts very well informed on affairs of state (so I suspect it wouldn't be that bad).
* Chaps in suits who look like they could cope in a crisis
* Local ganglords/rogue police chiefs fragment the country into warring fiefdoms.

But of course, to wipe out everyone that far down you'd probably have to destroy half the country before we descended into complete anarchy. I suspect that at some point we'd shove the First Minister of Scotland/Wales/Northern Ireland in the Lords to get them to run the show.

In any case, I'm not sure why you think the UK should get any credit here for being a big economy. When we're talking about one country having stronger finances than another, etc., we're using scaled figures - for instance, countries are compared with GDP per capita, not absolute GDP. In this case, Scotland's deficit is presented as a percentage of Scotland's GDP and the UK deficit is presented as a percentage of UK GDP.

&gt;Sean please see the response below to your query.
 
&gt;Both Dundee City Council and our project partners Scottish Enterprise, are of the view that the cities interests are best served by adhering to the Dundee Central Waterfront MasterPlan which although includes a major civic space and water feature, has never formally included provision for the H.M. Frigate Unicorn.

&gt;It is becoming increasingly clear that our ambition to transform the economic performance of the city will revolve around ensuring that we carefully plan for the regeneration of the wider waterfront. Ensuring that each element of the cities waterfront is mutually supportive of the other. Whilst the Central Waterfront is the focus for the bulk of public sector investment, over the coming years we are keen to ensure that this will act as a key catalyst in the development of the wider waterfront.

&gt;I can confirm that it is the Council's intention to make City Quay a key destination for shoppers, residents and tourists alike. We are about to refresh the Masterplan for City Quay and view a new marina and H.M. Frigate Unicorn as an important element in the future development of City Quay. 
We are increasingly persuaded of the important role which City Quay plays in the regeneration of Dundee's Waterfront and are committed to ensuring that it attracts future private and public investment. 
Regards

I don't know where you get your facts, but it clearly isn't any place reliable. There have been many apparent acts of anti-Semitic rhetoric from Chavez, and to deny them is to deny the possibility that he may have been anti-Semitic and not merely anti-Israel:

&gt;1. [In 2004, after he overcame the referendum on his presidency, Chávez told the opposition not to let themselves ""be poisoned by those wandering Jews. Don't let them lead you to the place they want you to be led""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Venezuela#Accusations_of_Ch.C3.A1vez_anti-Semitism)

&gt;3. [In 2005, he attacked 'some minorities, the descendants of the people who crucified Christ, [who] seized the riches of the world'.""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Venezuela#Accusations_of_Ch.C3.A1vez_anti-Semitism)

true,Feint1,eng-northhamptonshire,Northamptonshire,"&gt;So you see tax as a necessary evil. What tax do you believe is necessary? I basically want to know, given that you think some tax is necessary, what your specific argument against tax that goes on unemployment benefit is?

It's a necessary evil. In order for it to be justified it has to be as low as possible and spent incredibly carefully. Welfare can't really be justified in most circumstances.

&gt;How could somebody reinvest in a business if they can only afford the very basic's? Many people do not earn enough to save that sort of money or save any money at all. Also, it's very hard to get a loan when there not much proof you could pay it back and like i said that generally leads to more debt given that most business's fail. I'm not saying that this impossible, but its close. It's certainly not an argument against welfare.

With hard work, it's possible.

Welfare certainly wouldn't help, it just incentives people to stay at home.

&gt;Explain this please.

Every employable person has skills of some sort.

&gt;Sorry, i wrote that question badly. What i mean is, why does any entity defend the 'realm'? What the the aim in defending it?

It protects our society. Without a strong defence we're not safe.

&gt;Almost all of the poor ,as defined by our government, receive some sort of welfare payment. Not most, but almost all of the poor are on benefits of some sort (i'm obviously not just talking about unemployment benefit). So it is perfectly accurate to describe those on benefits as 'the poor'.

I've already explained it to you. People on welfare and the poor are not the same thing.

&gt;Firstly, could you define what you mean by invest for me? 

Trade something for something in return.

&gt;secondly, why are people not investing until they run out of money now?

They are.

&gt;What do you mean by 'had the money'? 

If you take 60% of someone's money then they have only 40% of the money they would otherwise have.

&gt;Washing car's would not make enough money to get of welfare.

I would disagree.

&gt;buying stock requires an understanding of stock markets and even if you do it without that its a gamble.

No it doesn't, I'm talking about buying stock as in buying items and selling them. That's what ""stock"" means.

&gt;As for Landscaping, most people do not hire anybody to do landscaping unless they have the qualifications for such a job. if you do get hired to do landscaping have had no experience or qualifications then you would be on a very low wage. in which case once again you would be on welfare.

Trimming hedges would probably do, hardly a skilled trade. If taxes were lower then the price of things would be lower and those low wages would go much further.

&gt;Also, jobs like landscaping are included in the job statistics were it says there is only 1 job for every 6 people unemployed. by becoming a landscaper or a car washer you are not 'creating a job' you are just entering into that already existent job market.

What you're really doing is finding work from the free market. Maybe someone else loses out, but that's not really anything to be concerned about.

&gt;But the idea of the social contract states that we give up a certain amount of rights so that we gain others. we enter into this contract to avoid living a hellish life in a state of nature. Tax exists so that the state can fulfill it's part of the contract. In that sense tax is morally justifiable.

I don't think the state has any place providing welfare or charity, so to me it isn't morally justifiable.

&gt;Since the free market has a tendency to create terrible poverty and force people into positions which are as bad as the state of nature it is thus the state's role to prevent this from happening, otherwise the state breaks the contract and becomes pointless. 

I think people should take responsibility for themselves.

&gt;But clearly China can beat us with regards to regulations and taxes as well. So how do you propose we can prevent big companies building their products abroad when we cannot compete with their wages? 

It's not about preventing ""big companies building their products abroad"", it's about not driving away our business through uncompetitive behaviour. Because of the distance and tariffs we'll always be at a transport and tax advantage.

Cutting regulations makes it cheaper and easier to do business here, it's not a game of numbers. All the government needs to do is highlight unpopular regulation and then remove them.

&gt;You also did not tell me if you think we should make are wages that low?

No, that'd be silly. Wages in the east of China are increasing pretty quickly while they're stagnant here, so the gap is closing. Longer hours may be part of a solution to fix the competitiveness gap though.

They take someone from a completely unrelated field and challenge them to become someone different in 4 weeks. So, for example, some of my favorites have been:

History of Art Student to Graffiti Artist

Insurance Salesman to Stuntman

Lawyer to Garage MC

They have 4 weeks to learn this craft and transform themselves. They then perform in front of three judges in whatever field they're trying for, along with three other performers who are authentic, and the judges decide who's real and who's faking it. If they fool two out of three judges they win. Not really a prize or anything, just the satisfaction of doing it.

But, it's just a really enjoyable show, where you're actually rooting for the person. I've seen a couple where the person is a bit cocky or they're just too afraid to look ridiculous and they don't fool the judges. But, those aren't the good episodes. The ones that are really fun are the ones where they really are humble and they take it seriously.

It's a really positive show. I feel the same about some of the Derren Brown specials I've seen (The zombie attack one, or the one where the guy had to fly the plane). I don't know how much of it is bullshit, but they're usually pretty uplifting. Are there any other UK reality shows like these I should check out?

Life tip: if you need to cash your pension in before it is due but want to remain working, consider the break in service continuity that they force you to take to facilitate this (a week off and then being re-employed with a new contract). She has lost 7 years of redundancy pay because she had to do this 5 years ago. 12 years of service and she's getting 5 months pay. It also makes you much cheaper to get rid of so you put yourself at a higher risk of being a cheap redundancy in your advanced years.

true,urkspleen,present,Frank Lampard,"I don't think any of us wouldn't welcome Jose back to the Bridge. Obviously if he and Abramovich could come to some sort of arrangement, there wouldn't be much preventing his coming. I don't think everything Hudson says is quite possible (especially grabbing either Ronaldo and/or Bale), but I'd like to lay out a few pro's and cons of Mou returing.

Pros:Jose is a great manager and would bring instant success. We would regain our winning mentality and determination. Given the way that Jose runs things, he would have the power to make the call on some important player contracts, thus allowing us to extend Lampard and Terry. If the higher-ups cooperate, he could help identify the holes in our squad and bring in the proper talent. 

Cons: Some of the deepest problems with the club relate to what Jose already did. It worked wonderfully, but the squad he built is almost gone now and it's play style does not align with the future vision of the club. I'm sure I'm not the only one that questions whether or not Jose could produce the kind of football we want. If the club wants to move in a new direction, Jose might not be the man.

Since I really want Jose, I'll address some of the cons. Personally, I don't care what style we play as long as we win games and play with heart. If we reeeaaaally wanted to play open attacking football, we probably could given the squad we have. I think Jose is a pragmatist and can get the best out of whatever squad he has. My only real concern is integrating the youth players. Our academy and prospects out on loan are REALLY impressive, and it would be a travesty if we couldn't manage to bring some of these players into the 1st team. I'm not too sure Jose's the guy to do that. Still want him though.

TLDR: Jose's great, sign him up

Why is it the case that sheep need to be sheared by humans? The explanation is that the alternative would involve them suffering/being in pain from their massive coat. However, sheep would not of survived for so long if, by necessity, they relied solely upon a symbiotic relationship with humans. Their massive coats, and the necessity of shearing, is solely the result of selective breeding.

Now I'm gonna come across as a bit of a twat for this, but I'm posting a PETA link solely because I'm too tired to find another link from a website that doesn't have so much negativity attached to it.

Journalists themselves, apart from columnists, are far from free to write as they please. I don't think any of that is a particularly controversial statement really.

The problem with the ""freedom of speech is bourgeois"" formulation is, bourgeois freedoms are still freedoms. As Orwell put it, undermining them is like sawing off the branch upon which you are perched.

It all comes from a highly hierarchical body of political thoery, that although astute about class and wealth had (and has) a fundamentally ignorance were power is concerned.

The teeth thing was the first thing, then, Milan found the transfer fee hard to be paid and they wanted to make the things little more cheep with him by pay only €12m instead the €15m, which was the initial agreement. Porto said NO, but the agent of the 21-years-old-defender has said that the deal is on the air again, but there is still this matter of decide the fee of the player with Porto. 

&gt;The vice president of AC Milan put an offer to the Portuguese club: they except the €12m that Milan were offering or the Rossoneri quite from the race of buying him. Afterwards, Milan offered also a loan deal on the Frenchman, which says he will be a Rossonero for one year with an option to be buying by Milan if they will decide so. This offer been rejected by them. Yesterday, it seemed like everything is going to be fix in Aly Cissokho move to Milan as the reports been telling that Milan and Porto have reached an agreement.

true,charzhazha,null,null,"I have definitely looked towards tv shows for inspiration and to help me deal with depression. What you are talking about, identifying with and being inspired by the doctor, is certainly something I am familiar with as well. I feel the same way about Temperance Brennan from Bones, because she is smart, passionate and independent in a way I would someday hope to be.

I have looked to Doctor Who for a different purpose: to help me cope with change. I really hate change and adapting to new circumstances, and I can get pretty depressed and just shut down when there is a big change in my future.  I even have trouble forming close relationships because of the eventual likelihood of drifting apart or moving, or any other negative change. The doctor struggles with the same issues-- because of his long lifespan he knows beyond a doubt that his friendships are temporary and he will outlive his companions-- and yet, he still continues to find new people to care for and love. I find that quite inspiring.

Besides that, Doctor Who is a show in constant flux: with 11 different main actors, and many different writers and producers, the feel of the show changes constantly. When I started watching Doctor Who, I stopped half way through the 4th season and skipped ahead to the 5th because I was afraid to say goodbye to Tennant. But I like the 11th doctor's run just as much as the 10th doctor's. I have gone back and watched many stories from the classic series, and found that they were wonderful, too. I'm sure it seems silly, but I use Doctor Who as a reminder to myself that change and goodbyes are not always bad, and in fact can be quite good and lead to better things.

RE Danny Carr - I'm a long distance Liverpool fan, but I live just down the road from Dulwich and have been to see most of their home games this season. Obviously he hasn't signed properly yet, and I hope he doesn't until the end of the season to be honest! But I thought I'd throw my tuppence in.


First of all, I think it's important to realise that he plays in one of the most impressive attacking teams in the division. Dulwich have an incredibly young, fit and talented team, and often that means that we absolutely batter weaker opponents, not unlike Liverpool this season it rarely stops until 3 or 4 goals have been scored. Danny is the spearhead, the number 9, and he's flanked by 2 very good wingers, and behind him we have the Messi of the Ryman league - a Turkish Cypriot who would surely be playing at a higher level if he weren't 5'3. The team plays remarkably attractive football for that division as well, it really is a joy to watch. So, in a lot of senses, he's got exactly the right setup around him to score a lot of goals.


However, that's not to say it's all on a plate for him, and in fact despite all the talent around him, before he came to us in about October we really struggled in the leagu, as we lacked that real cutting edge. After he joined, we went on a winning streak that only came to an end a couple of weeks ago, and it was Danny scoring the goals to help us do that.



In terms of what type of player he is, someone earlier mentioned that he looked like a Lukaku-type unit. He's not that type of player at all really, if I had to compare him to anyone it would be Sturridge. He's tall, and wins his fair share of aerial duels (and would probably win more if he wasn't up against your average non-league giant defenders) but his main attribute is probably his pace to get in behind defences. He's also got 2 brilliant feet - having seen him score some blinders with his left I was surprised to see him take a penalty with his right! He is a tremendous finisher, although he is the type to miss a relatively simple chance and then score a much more difficult one minutes later - I'd say he's better when acting on instinct, and his composure is certainly an area for improvement. He's also very skillful, and it's not unknown to see a bit of showboating from him towards the end of some of those preivously mentioned thrashings!



I do think the main aspect in his game that needs to be improved is his hold-up play. Admittedly he's quite often outnumbered up front, but his first touch is a little inconsistent when the ball is played up to him, and his vision and decision making when trying to bring others into play can be suspect. A lot of that is down to him not using the strength which he undoubtedly has well enough when under pressure.



All in all though he's been tremendous for us, and it's exciting to see him get a look in at not only a Premier League team, but Liverpool at that! We're not unaccustomed at Dulwich to seeing our players move on to bigger and better things - our academy is fairly well renowned and we've seen players move on to West Ham, Crystal Palace and Brentford over the last year or 2, as well as countless trials for other players who have remained - another cracking young midfielder recently spent a week at Bolton. I do hope though that we can hang on to him until the end of the season - we've suffered playoff final heartbreak 2 seasons in a row and a 3rd would be too much to take! So please let us keep him until summer",0,1362642794,null,0,false,0,c8raqe9,t3_19shbq,t1_c8raqe9,t3_19shbq,null,1431509368,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8

true,IsaakCole,tennant,Tennant,"I don't quite understand it myself, but it was based of off a series from a little while back called ""newuniversal"", which took place in a separate universe. John Hickman, the current writer of Avengers, is incorporating elements from that story into his current Avengers run.

Essentially, the universe of the Marvel heroes, Earth-616 as it's called, is undergoing a sort of transition phase which can be dangerous for the Earth and universe as a whole. Certain superhuman avatars are supposed to be chosen to safeguard the Earth during this time. They have different powers and are referred to as Justice, Starbrand, Nightmask, Cipher, etc. When the Earth enters this transition phase, and a new Nightmask or Stabrand or whatever is chosen, it's heralded by a White Event. A blinding flash all across the sky.

Millions of years ago, a race referred to only as the builders erected this system of selecting avatars to protect worlds, and it worked on a multiversal scale. However, for the past few issues the new Nightmask and Captain Universe (essentially a sentient portion of the universe itself, grafted onto a host) have been saying that the 'machine' and the universe are broken. The safeguards erected aren't working like they should.

Why this is, what will happen exactly, and what exactly this White Event means, we don't know yet. All we know so far is that a fundamental order in the universe has been disrupted, and the powers that were supposed to go to the guardians are likely going to be assigned to unworthy persons. In this case the Starbrand, which is supposed to go to someone with decent moral character and mental well being, has been granted to a social outcast who's been ignored all his life.

I know it sounds crazy and complicated, especially for someone who's unfamiliar with comics, but it really has been a great story so far. The Avengers has just relaunched and we're at issue 7 right now. It has the familiar movie line up plus a lot of other members. I'd recommend giving it a shot.

The preventable fraction was estimated to be 9.3% in the HPFS and 7.6% in the Nurses’ Health Study if the participants lowered their red meat (processed and unprocessed) consumption to less than 0.5 servings per day. The difference between the US studies and our result is likely due to the stronger risk estimates observed in the US cohorts compared with our cohort, but may also be explained by higher meat consumption in the US than in Europe.

Sick joke

MORE stories are emerging of the extreme distress and hardship caused to sick and disabled people wrongly found fit to work by Atos, the French private contractor, and consequently denied benefits by the Department for Work and Pensions.

Last week the Eye was alerted by lawyers to the case of a woman with fragments of bullet and shards of her skull permanently lodged into her brain, who was deemed by Atos to have no care needs or mobility problems — despite a change in her mental state leading to extended periods of unconsciousness.

The Commons public accounts committee last month blamed ministers for the ""misery and hardship"" suffered by claimants, saying that while Atos (which has earned more than £100m a year over the past four years for its ""work capability"" contract) was getting assessments disastrously wrong, the government was doing nothing to check or improve reliability.

Nor was there any sign of improvement, with Citizens Advice reporting an 83 percent increase in the past year in the number of people asking for support on appeals against decisions. Charities and legal advisers also complain that people with long-term, incurable or terminal conditions often face repeated assessments to prove how unwell they are, despite supplying doctors' and consultants' evidence that their health or condition will never improve.

Those most in need of help, meanwhile, are about to get another kicking from the govemment as, from next month, legal aid is withdrawn in the vast majority of benefit cases. The government is reneging on a promise from former lord chancellor Kenneth Clarke to allow free legal support in ""point of law"" cases at the first-tier tribunal level — the stage of the tribunal process where most cases remain.
 
Clarke had said he was concerned about the impact on disabled people making their initial appeal against a decision by the DWP on their benefit entitlement. But not so Chris Grayling, his successor, who wants to save £350m a year in legal aid by 2015 by axing free advice for most cases involving child custody, divorce, medical negligence, immigration, employment, housing debts and benefits. According to Grayling's own figures, an estimated 623,000 people will lose out. A number of legal advice centres have already closed as the proposed cuts are already taking effect on law firms and centres, which can only claim legal aid after dealing with the case.

As one lawyer told the Eye: ""What this means, in reality, is that some very ill and distressed people will simply not have the capacity to challenge appalling decisions."" Benefits tribunals will meanwhile get clogged up with badly prepared or even meritless appeals — and the only beneficiary will be Atos.

Grammar notwithstanding your assertion that the 3 mainland countries are legally such while NI is not stands on pretty flimsy ground. The UK has no written constitution, and the last big Act of Union setting out the constitutional status of Wales referred to it as a principality. The devolved administration refers to itself as a country, however it's unclear whether it has the power to do so, and more generally whether the necessarily general definition of a country is a legal issue at all.

[Common knowledge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countries_of_the_United_Kingdom) suggests all 4 constituent parts of the UK are indeed countries. As OP points out (and if I could correct slightly but I think it's what they meant) NI is a country within a federal state.

You can't access any sort of benefit until you have your Indefinite Leave to Remain. You've always needed to show you could reasonably survive here without access to housing benefit, Job seekers allowance, or any other sort of benefit. The official/unofficial guideline was roughly £17K to support two people when I went through this process nine years ago. £17K to support a couple puts you close to the poverty line, near which you would possibly need benefit of some sort to survive. That amount can be met through work or other support. £18K isn't an overly difficult income to achieve. I know of shelf stackers/warehouse guys in the north of England who make £18K... receptionists &amp; office juniors with minimal qualifications and experience make £15K. The income requirement is a hurdle, but not an insurmountable obstacle. 

I hate the immigrant bashing from the Tories, but I can also see the sense in saying you need to show you can survive in this country without any sort of government support. Why move here and not have a roof over your head? How do you expect to pay for the visa, let alone the ILR, without an income that would let you survive with only one of you working?

Although it is true that fish stocks have been falling for many years before the CFP so it cannot be held solely to blame for this problem, the falling stocks are largely due to the industries practices, in particular the use of intensive trawling methods, which I hope will be addressed in the future.

Your point is correct in that there is regulation, mine is that the regulation hasn't strong enough or as reactive as it should have been and that it's quotas have not really been based on any kind of scientific or environmental basis. It can be therefore said it's been biased towards the industry, fishermen and not the environment. I think that the environment, which these fishermen and their industry relies on, should come first in any considerations in the future regulations included in the CFP.",0,1362657582,null,0,false,0,c8rcb4r,t3_19u5en,t1_c8rcb4r,t1_c8rc56m,null,1431510169,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Thank you, I took your advice and spoke to a lawyer (the UK offers 2 hours worth of free legal advice if you meet certain financial requirements). Turns out that while the original advertisement might help me in the a small claims court, the chances of me winning, plus the cost of the legal fees, makes it all pretty pointless.

I did get paid for the shifts I worked, however, they promised me that £200+, and in my financial situation I'm in at the moment, I could have really done with that money.

Start from the people you know and work your way backwards. So you don't overwhelm yourself, stick to a branch you want to search, like the paternal side of your dad's family. If you think it might be too much for you to do before his birthday I'd say even just try to find out as much as you can about one family member that he might find interesting! 

Also, try your local library. Not sure if it's the same everywhere but my library has a local history section with old pictures, documents etc. which was a great resource.

I managed to get very far with my family tree which was surprising really, got back to around the 1600's I think? It can be quite cost-consuming however. I never kept track on how much I spent doing my tree but I did have memberships with Ancestry + ScotlandsPeople relies on you buying credits.

Some sites that may be of use to you: -

* [RootsChat](http://www.rootschat.com/forum/index.php?PHPSESSID=019ibgknc7iosipnnek5cm6np0&amp;) - Family history forum, people are really helpful and it's a great resource to use.

* [FreeCen](http://www.freecen.org.uk/)

* [FreeBMD](http://www.freebmd.org.uk/)

* [Ancestry](http://www.ancestry.co.uk/) - Subscription based to search, however I think they have a free trial initially.

* [Commonwealth War Graves Commission](http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead.aspx) - If you know of anyone in your family who fought and died in the World Wars you can do a search and find out where they're buried and it sometimes lists people they were related to back home.

Sorry if this is not much help, haven't done it in a while so can't remember most of the sites I used. If you find any Scottish relatives you want to do a search for just message me as I tend to have ScotlandsPeople credits anyway and I don't mind helping people out as I know how expensive it can get.

**Text from WM Police website to follow:**

A MAJOR manhunt is underway in Birmingham today (Thursday 7 March) following a fatal stabbing on a bus just outside the city centre.

Officers from across the force − supported by police dog handlers, firearms officers, transport police and others − are searching for the person responsible.

West Midlands Police have identified victim as a 16-year-old girl.

Specially trained Family Liaison Officers are providing immediate care for the victim’s next of kin in conjunction with partner agencies.

Detectives from the force’s Criminal Investigation Department are currently working alongside specialist Forensic Scene Investigators at the scene to identify CCTV systems which may have captured the incident on camera.

Initial descriptions of the knifeman from witnesses is a black man in his teens with very dark skin who was wearing dark coloured clothing. His jacket is thought to have a tiger’s head or other large motif printed on the back. He may have been carrying a bag of some sort.

Detective Superintendent Richard Baker from Force CID urged the public to help keep their eyes peeled and to report any sightings.

""This is a tragic case and the victim’s family are devastated. Few of us can imagine what they are going through and we are working hard to indentify the offender which involves speaking to a large number of people who witnessed the attack,"" said Det Supt Baker.

""From their descriptions, we are keen to identify a young black man in dark clothing who was on the bus and seen fleeing from the area around the time of the murder.

""I would urge the public not to approach the man but to immediately dial 999. We have officers ready to respond immediately to sightings.""

Police were alerted to the incident at 7.37am when the bus driver reported that a passenger had been wounded.

Officers and other emergency services were immediately dispatched but despite valiant efforts to save the teen it was clear that this was a fatal attack.

Officers who flooded the scene and spoke to witnesses remain at the location near to the Morrisons supermarket on Hagley Road.

The out of city stretch of Hagley Road re-opened at around 11.45am.

Officers have spoken to a large number of witnesses at the scene but anyone with information which may help police find the person responsible for killing the girl should call officers immediately on the dedicated incident room hotline: 0800 096 0095.",0,1362658513,null,0,false,0,c8rcezh,t3_19uaps,t1_c8rcezh,t3_19uaps,null,1435573015,6,false,brum,t5_2rdjk,6

true,CinemaParadiso,english,England,"As soon as we get to the crux of the problem you seem to full back on Rhetoric. 

&gt;It's a necessary evil. In order for it to be justified it has to be as low as possible and spent incredibly carefully. Welfare can't really be justified in most circumstances.

I understand that argument. In what circumstances can Welfare be justified and in what circumstances can it not? 

&gt;With hard work, it's possible.
Welfare certainly wouldn't help, it just incentives people to stay at home.

Hard work is not an answer. That does not mean anything. Welfare helps people to eat and look after themselves. Your much more likely to go out and get a job if your healthy than if your starving. It is a myth that people are happy to live of welfare and get a job. That does not apply to any percentage high enough to be of concern.

&gt;It protects our society. Without a strong defence we're not safe.

Welfare protects are society. It keeps people from starving and so keeps them safe in that regard. It also keeps people from rioting or revolting against the government, so it keeps wider society safe in that regard. So why is tax that goes towards defence ok and welfare not ok?

&gt;I've already explained it to you. People on welfare and the poor are not the same thing.

Almost all of the poor ,as defined by our government, receive some sort of welfare payment. Not most, but almost all of the poor are on benefits of some sort (i'm obviously not just talking about unemployment benefit). So it is perfectly accurate to describe those on benefits as 'the poor'.

&gt;They are.

They are not. Having your money sit in a bank does not count as investing. Here is a [source](http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/trends/banks-still-failing-to-invest-in-public-trust/4005807.article)

&gt;If you take 60% of someone's money then they have only 40% of the money they would otherwise have.

But they already have alot more to invest that they are not investing. There is no reason to expect that if they had a few more million they would suddenly invest. it is not logical. Most of the Rich's money sit's in the bank. Money sitting in the bank is not an investment in the real economy. The 2008 crash showed us that.

&gt;I would disagree.

Based on what?

&gt;What you're really doing is finding work from the free market. Maybe someone else loses out, but that's not really anything to be concerned about.

BUT YOUR WHOLE ARGUMENT WAS ABOUT PEOPLE CREATING JOBS!! Now your saying that this would not make basic unemployment go down. This whole thing started because you said that their is no reason for people to be unemployed. Now you say if somebody could take a job and make themselves unemployed, that make someone else unemployed. But you would not give that person money to survive? You have just backtracked on your whole argument. Your an idiot. Also, why should we not be concerned when a fellow citizens becomes unemployed? Do you not have any feelings? Do you not want to live in a society that cares for those at the bottom? The society you describe is a selfish, atomized cold place in which economy dominates and humanity means nothing. Do you not think that we should try and create the best society possible? 

Bottom line: Do you except that their is a basic rate of unemployment? If yes, do you accept that we must keep these people from starvation? If no, do you accept that whilst their will be unemployment in the near future we must keep these people from starving? 

&gt;I don't think the state has any place providing welfare or charity, so to me it isn't morally justifiable.

I already know that's what you think. you said it before. what i'm saying is that the idea of the social contract states that we give up a certain amount of rights so that we gain others. we enter into this contract to avoid living a hellish life in a state of nature. Tax exists so that the state can fulfill it's part of the contract. In that sense tax is morally justifiable. What is your argument against this? 

&gt;I think people should take responsibility for themselves.

why? They are not responsible for society. They are born into  a society already created for them. Why punish them for mistakes made by others?

&gt;It's not about preventing ""big companies building their products abroad"", it's about not driving away our business through uncompetitive behaviour. Because of the distance and tariffs we'll always be at a transport and tax advantage.
Cutting regulations makes it cheaper and easier to do business here, it's not a game of numbers. All the government needs to do is highlight unpopular regulation and then remove them.

Why do you think that it is morally unjustifiable that people's money should be taken away from them 'without permission' in the form of tax but morally justifiable that we should be held hostage by corporate interests? Do you not think that their is a place for morality in determining are actions towards the actions of companies? You must not be a very patriotic man if you really believe that private interests trump the interests of our society.

&gt;No, that'd be silly.

Wages in LEDC with never rise to our level though. Not without wages coming down here first. So you see we cannot compete with those countries, big companies will always seek the cheapest labor. Do you think in this area it might be a good idea to implement a higher minimum wage? In those countries. Perhaps we could have an international minimum wage via the UN. The UN does say that a human right is to be paid enough to live on and this is not the case in alot of these countries.

* **Chiricheş** is a great young defender - likes to get out of defence with the ball and help out the attack with assisting passes and even shooting (sort of like David Luiz). See Chiricheş's goals in Europa League: [against Molde](http://youtu.be/oJDg8tereHE?t=1m55s) (1:55)  and [against Ajax](http://youtu.be/-3AanwgImI8?t=5m15s) (5:15).
* **Rîpă** is really young and I believe he will be easily beaten by the likes of Eden Hazard. 
* **Bourceanu** is the captain. He's a strong player and the most important in the midfield. He takes every corner and most of the free kicks. Same role as Lampard or Pirlo (but of course not as skilful).
* **Rusescu** is Steaua's and Romanian first league's top scorer; hasn't been as good in Europa League, but can be decisive as he was in the match against FC København. See the goal [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7aXLhM2vw).

I went to a private school on a bursary. Most of the scholarship kids since leaving have done pretty well at university - good degree results and most are in jobs. However a substantial portion of the other kids, despite getting into the same universities and achieving roughly the same grades, have struggled to a far greater extent (that is, not including the ones who dropped out entirely and whose parents found them jobs...)

Meanwhile at university, some of my friends despite achieving lower grades (while still being let in) than some of the private school
Lot, have simply outperformed them in every way possible. Most universities are not Oxbridge and do not have the resources for interview processes for all applicants outside of medicine, so this seems a good tool to use. From my admittedly anecdotal
Experience, there is a substantial difference between 3As at a school deemed failing by ofsted, and a private school, and even between a leafy state school in Surrey.

Speaking to an Oxbridge adviser they say that they do give out offers as widely as possible but many simply fail to make the a level grades. With that in mind, and within reason, an unconditional offer should be more widespread.

**Text from WM Police website to follow:**

A MAJOR manhunt is underway in Birmingham today (Thursday 7 March) following a fatal stabbing on a bus just outside the city centre.

Officers from across the force − supported by police dog handlers, firearms officers, transport police and others − are searching for the person responsible.

West Midlands Police have identified victim as a 16-year-old girl.

Specially trained Family Liaison Officers are providing immediate care for the victim’s next of kin in conjunction with partner agencies.

Detectives from the force’s Criminal Investigation Department are currently working alongside specialist Forensic Scene Investigators at the scene to identify CCTV systems which may have captured the incident on camera.

Initial descriptions of the knifeman from witnesses is a black man in his teens with very dark skin who was wearing dark coloured clothing. His jacket is thought to have a tiger’s head or other large motif printed on the back. He may have been carrying a bag of some sort.

Detective Superintendent Richard Baker from Force CID urged the public to help keep their eyes peeled and to report any sightings.

""This is a tragic case and the victim’s family are devastated. Few of us can imagine what they are going through and we are working hard to indentify the offender which involves speaking to a large number of people who witnessed the attack,"" said Det Supt Baker.

""From their descriptions, we are keen to identify a young black man in dark clothing who was on the bus and seen fleeing from the area around the time of the murder.

""I would urge the public not to approach the man but to immediately dial 999. We have officers ready to respond immediately to sightings.""

Police were alerted to the incident at 7.37am when the bus driver reported that a passenger had been wounded.

Officers and other emergency services were immediately dispatched but despite valiant efforts to save the teen it was clear that this was a fatal attack.

Officers who flooded the scene and spoke to witnesses remain at the location near to the Morrisons supermarket on Hagley Road.

The out of city stretch of Hagley Road re-opened at around 11.45am.

Officers have spoken to a large number of witnesses at the scene but anyone with information which may help police find the person responsible for killing the girl should call officers immediately on the dedicated incident room hotline: 0800 096 0095.

The waiting room was one of the most fucked up places I've ever been to. Signs everywhere, with grinning idiots on them with the words: ""It's not what you can't do, its what you can do"". The other attendees were quite a mixed bunch. Two of them, a couple being seen on the same day, were mountainous folk who slept their way through (sitting completely upright, supported by there bulk) before being seen. One poor woman, was constantly vomiting into a plastic cup (the place reeked of bile). I asked the secretary if she had anything for the woman to vomit into as she wasn't going to make it to the toilet (on the next floor up) and she gave me a piece of plastic wrapping that came from a multipack of mineral water. 

There were some really ill people there and some, who in my opinion, didn't seem that ill (although, what do I know). 

We were waiting over three hours before being seen. The doctor asked my mother to do a variation of the Macarena and declared her fit to work. Her disability wasn't covered by the scope of the questions asked at all (she can't have been in there more than 20 minutes). The main reason why this support was important to my mum was related to her medication (of which, many are prescribed) and with the latest evaluation, she would have had to pay for all of her medication which would have wiped her out. My mother's GP was horrified by her treatment and had written to them several times, before and after, with supporting documentation explaining why she was deemed unfit to work. 

I appreciate that the whole point of these examinations are to lessen the strain on the the welfare system and ""get the scroungers back to work"" but I absolutely deplore the broad scale measures being taken by the govt. I think the government is completely aware of how fucked up things are and is happy to take the recommendations that Atos provide as it will give a short term boost to their austerity rhetoric.

For better or for worse, exams are a huge part of university education and if they thought A-levels were hard and stressful, they're in for a seriously bad surprise.

Agreed. The 'pressure' is a part of the whole exam scenarios. You either thrive under the pressure by studying hard and do as well as you can, or you get too stressed and can't deal with it and fail. 

It's a bad move IMO, especially when you consider the scenario that someone that aced their AS Levels can get an unconditional and not do as well as they could, versus another student that might knuckle down and pull better grades out of the bag and not be offered a place. 

If A Levels exams aren't working in their ability to select the best students for a university place then A Level assessments need to change - not the selection criteria of universities.

true,cb43569,cnty-scotland,Dundee,"Thanks for putting words into my mouth. I think you'll find Scottish MPs make up only 59 of Westminster's 650 MPs, barely a tenth -- and you've highlighted another core tenet of the independence movement by reminding me how bipartisan the House of Commons is. Solely instituting the partially proportional electoral system we use in Scottish Parliament means no more bullshit choice between Labour and the Conservatives. But, sure. Misrepresent my entire argument -- which is that decisions affecting Scotland should be made by a parliament that entirely represents Scotland -- as saying ""Scots are better"", because I'm sure that mischaracterisation rouses the patriotism and offence of many. Throw in ""just not cricket"" so you come across all hilarious like Boris Johnson.

There is absolutely no moral or legal argument for the entirety of the Scottish bank debt to be saddled on Scotland. The banks operated mostly in England; the banks were regulated by Westminster; the UK Government decided to bail them out. They are now the same as any other liability owned by the UK Government, and that means Scotland will accept only a population share -- *as it should be*.

I'm curious if you're familiar with Fortis, the Benelux financial institution which crashed and was collectively bailed out by Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. It was based in Belgium, but funnily enough, that didn't mean the three countries decided to say ""augh, it's a Belgian bank, obviously, they can handle it"". This is because international co-ordination and shared responsibility are real and possible diplomatic manouvres! If Scotland was independent during the bank crisis (which is already a stupid hypothetical because it gives no variables like an independent Scotland's banking legislation, financial status, etc.), its nearest neighbour would have been a major customer of its banks and would have been well and truly fucked by the crash of, say, RBS. As a result, international precedent suggests the two countries may have bailed RBS out together.

You know what isn't cricket? The UK Government's attitude which is ""Scotland can't take anything except the debt"". Scotland is entitled to an appropriate share of *everything*. That's in the spirit of the Union. Constantly disputing Scotland's asset share, treaty obligations, and so on is counter-productive and lacks legal basis.",0,1362666145,null,0,false,0,c8rdoml,t3_19rq4t,t1_c8rdoml,t1_c8rbt7h,null,1431510812,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Entirely his opinion, a not particularly well formed one either.

&gt;Scotland benefits hugely from being tied with the UK. 

Again, his opinion. Plenty evidence suggests that it's completely to the contrary. Scotland could better serve itself as an Independent country through control of it's own finances. At the moment we contribute 9.9% of the UK's taxes, but only receive 9.3% of it's spending. 

Outwith the UK, it's projected that we could have 4.4bn extra spending, which we could either use to increase public services, lower taxes, or lower the debt. 

Our GDP is 15% higher per head than the UKs', and our deficit is predicted to be reduced by 75% within the first year of Independence. In short, his point is completely wrong. 

&gt;They would even have to apply for EU membership.

HUGELY debatable. Professor Graham Avery of Oxford University, and a Director General of the European Commision, completely disagrees with his point:

http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmfaff/writev/643/m05.htm

&gt;Also to note, there is a high population of Scottish nationals in the British armed forces.

This is a complete non-issue. The SNP have already made it clear that any personnel serving in the British Armed Forces will be given the option of remaining with the Armed Forces, or joining the Scottish Defence Force; they're able to do this because people living in the Commonwealth are able to join the British Army.

Firstly, fishermen will sometimes catch fish that they do not consider valuable enough to be worth keeping.  The only way to stop them discarding these at sea is to police them while they are at sea, which is likely to be expensive and unpopular.  I understand that a couple of countries have experimented with requiring CCTV cameras on fishing boats, but it doesn't sound as though this has been a resounding success.  Alternatively, we could move to a system where the government pays fishermen a flat amount regardless of what they catch and confiscates it all as soon as it is on dry land, but I can't imagine that being very popular.

Secondly, we have quotas to limit fishing and encourage fishermen to try and go for the healthier stocks.  Quotas of some form are clearly necessary, otherwise you end up with a Northwest Atlantic cod-style disaster.  Stopping people from fishing as soon as *any* stock has gone over the quota is presumably not feasible, and the quotas obviously have to be enforced somehow.  In any case, it must be better for stocks to discard the fish, returning the biomass to the sea and providing nutrients for other life, than bringing it ashore.

From the article, it just sounds as though the quotas will remain in place, but will be based on rigorous estimates of the maximum sustainable yield instead of political negotiations.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7757050.stm

Perhaps the biggest issue with heroin are the effects for wider society. It's addictive as fuck costs over £40k a year to maintain, which isn't all that easy as an addict, although a study in scotland did show that it happens. 

It is a health problem, not a criminal problem.

It is precisely because it is illegal that it is a criminal problem, it is an issue of prohibition which demonstrably doesn't work. The fact that it puts billions into a black market of people who can only defend their earnings, position, distribution and the rest through violence, because they have no legal recourse. If we legalised drugs it would devastate gangs as it would deny them of almost all of their income. 

Which drug has been determined to cause the greatest harm? alcohol - http://media.economist.com/sites/default/files/20101106_WOC504_0.gif

As it stands we simply give users methadone instead which is pretty much the same thing and is traded and sold just like heroin. How is that any better?

true,ukpolitico,null,null,"For the sake of clarity.....the issues increasing housing benefit are not tackled by this approach. Any reductions in HB will eventually be picked up elsewhere and the groups targeted are not responsible for the increase.

The government argues this is not a tax, but the withdrawal of an unfair spare room subsidy enjoyed by benefit scroungers who are wasting tax payer’s money living in large houses they do not need.

The government points out that the Housing Benefit bill has doubled in recent years, and therefore ‘something must be done’.

So the three pillars of their argument is fairness, proper allocation of housing to need, and a reduction in the housing benefit bill to the tax payer.  Sound perfectly reasonable does it not?  Now let’s bust some myths.

First let us look at capacity.  There are five million people on waiting lists for social housing in the UK today.

Currently the UK is building 100,000 homes a year less than it needs to in order to meet requirements.  There is not adequate housing of sufficient type (one bed, two bed, three bed, etc) to meet needs.

The great council house sell off, Thatcher’s plan to turn the working class into the new property class, was a manifest failure; more than a third of ex council houses now sit in the property portfolios of wealthy landlords.  In fact, the son of Thatcher’s Housing Minister at the time the ‘Right to Buy’ scheme was launched is now the proud owner of no less than forty ex council houses.

The limited remaining council housing rationed out to the poorest of the poor with council housing waiting lists and mortgages ever further out of reach, everyone else is a hostage to the private rental market dominated by these landlords.

The truth is, decades of defunct housing policy has left the UK with a housing shortage crisis.

Secondly, let’s examine the issue of tackling the cost of Housing Benefit.

The National Housing Federation issued a report last year which showed Housing Benefit has doubled in recent years as a direct result of an astronomical increase in housing costs.  The report shows an 86% rise in housing benefit claims by working families, with 10,000 new claims coming in per month.  House prices are now 300% higher (in real terms) than in 1959.

true,andylfc1993,null,null,"Uh, just so you know, the score in 'Wars against Amercia' is actually 1:1. See 'Washington burns 1812'.

Secondly, the height of British power was 1800-1945, we only got stronger after we left the New World. We had a choice between focusing on India or the Americas, and since the Americas held no real economic advantage, we focused on the Indians.

Secondly, the only reason you won the war was because A) France bankrupted themselves to help you, and B) We never fully saw it as a war. Do you really think a bunch of rebels could have won the war against the 'mighty British Empire'? If we had seen it as a do or die war, and thought America was worth keeping onto, then you can bet your bloody yank arses you would be spelling 'civilized' as 'civilised' today.

Thirdly, this whole WW2 point is boring, and wrong. 

Could the allies have won the war without Russia: No.
Could the allies have won the war without Britain: No.
Could the allies have won the war without America: Possibly.

Let me explain. Russia did pretty much *all* of the land fighting in WW2. There is absolutely no victory without her pushing germany back into her Eastern Borders, it just doesn't happen. Secondly, the Russian war effort was so great, that both Britain and America saw NO need to invade France. It wasn't until Stalin called for a second front in italy (which failed) that we decided D-Day was a must.

Onto why Britain was important. D-Day. 

Wouldn't have happened if the British had not decimated the German Luftwaffe in the Battle of Britain. Britain had pretty much wrestled the skies from german hands, in an act which saw them stand alone against continental Europe. Did we give in, did we surrender? No. We dug deep and gave them hell.

Without both Russia and Britain so far, Germany would have had the waters, the skies, and continental Europe easily. There would be NO chance of taking France back, and Germany would have won.


Onto Americas contribution. So what did you do? Aside from joining late of course, you are most known for helping out in the D-Day landings. The thing is, the Allies only needed to take one front, and you were only involved in two. Also, there were just as much, if not more, British-Canadian soldiers involved in D-Day than there were Americans. And by this point anyway, Russia was winning the war in the East.

Secondly, the reason I said *possibly* is due to financial aid. That is the only reason your country *helped* win WW2 from a historical perspective. Yes, people died, and for that our country is grateful. But for you to come here and say that we *owe* the win to the USA is just plain silly. You gave us a lot of money during and after the war, and your industry served the Russians well. This is why you deserve credit, not for the fighting which you seem to think the USA dominated.

This isn't me being a patriot, this is fact. The USA helped in both world wars, yes. But in terms of fighting? Not really, we don't *owe* you (as you say) for that. We owe you for helping us out economically.


Oh btw, for shits and giggles. Do you know what happened to American soldiers before they were deployed in the front lines in WW1/WW2?

No you and the article did not.


&gt; No one is arguing that someone without the need to should have a larger house than they need at the expense of the tax payer. I have not argued that here or in the article so your question is moot.

At no point did anyone suggest this.

&gt; I've given a list of examples of people in the piece which this question would apply to and why it is more complex than that. These people are not exempt. The policy as it stands does not represent fairness. The point is the rise in housing benefit has not been caused by people living in houses too big for their needs. It's been directly caused by the rise in rents &amp; working families claiming HB to stay in their homes. 

All unrelated to the question asked. You're not engaging in conversation; you are just stating things

&gt; I've evidenced my comments in the article. How are you evidencing yours?

Both of my comments have done nothing but point out you avoided answering the question put by /u/Godwinspeed

&gt; Are you going to support a policy which will do nothing to address the root causes of the problem and result in a serious amount of suffering for 420,000 disabled people? 

Again, my entire involvement in this post has been to point out that you did not address a question which was asked of you

I've read the form a few times but it does my head in. There are a lot of questions about being able to look after yourself.

For example getting to a bus stop. Sure I can do this. I could run on a treadmill for an hour if I wanted too. Stresses me the hell out though.

Also questions about preparing meals. I'm a pretty good cook but if I want to make a meal from scratch that has more than 2 components I can never get the timing right. 
My mum doesn't let me make toasted bacon sandwiches because I can't judge the times and we end up with hot toast and cold bacon lol.

I'm planning to go back to Australia. 

I used to work for a bank here and I was doing really well. I had the best stats of all the new people. I to attend a meeting about my autism and tell them what help I required.

They hasn't done any research or anything. They outright told me they knew nothing. The issue is for me - I'm normal because I've always been this way so I don't know what help I need. It takes an outside observer to notice it.

They sacked me for something I hadn't done, I launched a huge complaint and got my job back and spent a month being escorted to and from lunch and the bathroom because all my security checks had been deleted. I had no accounts or computer systems and was keeping customers private information on post it notes.

I finally cracked under the pressure and quit. I've been unemployed since.

There's no support here and it really saddens me because so many people don't have the option of jumping on a plane and going somewhere better :(

For another thing, BBC shows are commercial-free, so there's about 7-8 more minutes of content that would have to be cut.  (Though that's not a concern with shows from Channel 4 and other commercial channels)

You're so stuck in your own 'Government/Corporations bad, poor people good' rhetoric you can't even see it.

I'll give you a little story:

Mary works for John. John is involved in some shady dealings, but makes a lot of money, so pays Mary a lot of money. Mary has a son, Carl. Mary looks after Carl, because he is too young to look after himself. Because she earns good money from John, she can afford to give Carl an ice cream every day.

John's business gets in trouble for it's shady dealings, and suddenly he is not as rich. Therefor, he had to cut his wages to Mary. Mary now cannot give Carl his daily ice cream. He still has a roof over his head, and food on his plate. He has only lost a luxury he did not need.

Carl now complains, because it's not *his* fault John got in trouble, so why should he suffer? He got his ice cream when Mary had money, so why should he not still get it, just because Mary now has a smaller income. That's not his fault.

The SHA also stated they had brought up land in the area with the plan to build more Social Housing, however in the last year the Gov has slashed the Social Housing Budgets and it is now no longer economically viable for Housing Associations to build properties (doing so would drain all resources and as the association is NOT FOR PROFIT they have no excess of cash for new builds) So instead what does the government do?
oh yes Billions for a HS2 that no-one wants or really needs, billions on pointless vanity projects... that money should be used to enable SHA to build the housing we need (indeed in my town vast swathes of old industrial sites have been razed to the ground for housing to be built and is not sitting empty as there is no money in the pot to build on them)

Housing isn't a luxury. Yes, numerous spare bedrooms are, but that's not what we're talking about here. 

What happens, if there isn't a suitable downsized property to move to, and you can't afford your current rent? Should you rent privately, at a higher cost to the govt, from landlords who are reluctant to rent to claimants? 

A story in response. 

Carl lives in a 2 bed housing authority property. He had shared it with a wife and daughter, but then his marriage broke up. He now has to downsize or make up the shortfall in rent himself.

Resulting in the wealthy getting even wealthier and the poor still being stuck in over priced rentals..

The only way to 'Fix' this is to block purchases of properties unless it is your main residence, the Government to seize all excess housing stocks (this would be challenged and dragged through court for years and years) and then use this excess housing stock to encourage people to spend.

Afterall if they 'own' the housing stock, pay a company to maintain them and then anything over the cost of running and maintaining the properties could then be used to fund other things.

Calling it NHS doctors vs private is pretty silly, since it's almost guaranteed that your private doctor will also be working in the NHS. And quality does sadly vary based on location and time, you can never guarantee that your doctor will be perfect but like I said, tarring them all with the same brush is ridiculous.

&gt;The point I was trying to make was that the government doesn't want to leave it to doctors as many will sign people off just to get them out the door.

The same could be said for post-operation sick notes, yet the government trusts doctors to sign off on those. But I entirely disagree. If you're saying doctors will just sign off to shove people out the door you may as well say that a doctor will just give you anything you want so that they don't have to spend time with you. It's preposterous, doctors have ethical requirements that are rooted in the GMC's good medical practice guide as well as the law.

It's their duty and job to make a fair and comprehensive assessment, and while mistakes do happen and poor doctors exist, if the government doesn't trust doctors for that reason then they'd be saying that they don't trust doctors to do their jobs. If that truly is the case then signing off on ability to work assessments is a drop in the ocean in comparison to all the other things that they're trusted to do.",0,1362681830,null,0,false,0,c8rifev,t3_19u6ti,t1_c8rifev,t1_c8rguk9,null,1431513088,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

It's just another contemporary interpretation of the original Sherlock Holmes characters and is not at all related to the Gatiss/Moffat version.

I feel people who make remarks like waterdown did haven't actually seen the show or have seen very, very little of it. I mean Elementary has had 17 x 45min episodes air in 6 months compared to 6 x 90min episodes in 3 years. It's ridiculous to expect the same level of quality.

Sherlock is a far better television show than Elementary, sure, I will never disagree with that. The problem is that Sherlock is a far better television show than most television shows. Elementary is a procedural drama and compared to other procedural dramas, it's really quite good. It is not a remake of Sherlock, Jonny Lee Miller's Holmes is not the same character as that which Benedict Cumberbatch plays.

true,pylori,cnty-england,East Midlands,"&gt;Part of the reason must be people wrongly claiming disability and doctors wrongly signing people off.

Says who? You? NHS doctors don't sign off on this to begin with (which was my earlier point), the only other issue is people wrongly claiming disability. If that is the case then since ATOS are the ones responsible for disability assessment surely it is logical to conclude that they are the ones poorly assessing people, if the rise is occurring under their watch?

And all that even ignores the ever changing medical problems of the population. Diabetes and obesity are still on the rise, for example, with a population that is getting progressively more and more unhealthy, more people are being treated for illnesses, it only makes sense that people with need for claiming time off work as a result (which includes mental health issues that could prevent them from working) would also increase.

I'm not saying there are people who don't try to scam the system, those will always exist. But I fail to see how your conclusion is that Atos are the people that should be running the show considering that they're the ones in charge now and things haven't gotten any better.

I got there around 30 mins after it happened. Before it was on the news or anything like that. I was off elsewhere. Saw the police and the entire Hagley road was blocked. I got around to the back of it via side streets and walked the rest. It was obvious it was something big.

At first there was only a smallish cordon, at the closest point around 15 meters from the bus. There was nothing to really see at this point. just lots of police. Take a look on the daily mail ( don't hate on it) and anything you see with the copyright ""caters news"" is what I shot when I got there or in the following hours. 

After they moved the bus, I drove off, following another agency photographer. We timed it just as the suspect was getting arrested. (his photos are on the dailymail I *think* his pics were slightly better) that was quite a surreal thing to watch and have timed perfectly.

I shot nightclubs, I was in the right place at the right time ( it happens all the time to me). I got chatting to a guy who was doing a piece on binge drinking. Anyways he needed some help with pics as it wasnt his usual thing. Me being in my usual place of work helped out and sent him photos the same night. they needed a photographer, I'd already proved myself willing and able and it went from there. That was over 2 years ago.

true,littleselene,null,null,"I think there's impossible for River to be Oswin cause there is no point in her timeline (wich one at this point as almost easily reconstructed) where she could be her:

- River borns as Melody Pond on Demon's Run.
- Then she's taken by The Silence to some point on the 60's and they leave her in the orphanage. 
- On 1969 they attempt to put her on the astronaut suit and then she ask the president for help. After the 3 months Amy, Rory and River spend travelling America looking for Silences (the time when amy is kidnapped and replaced for a flesh avatar), she scapes and lives on the streets.
- 6 months later she dies from starvation or pneumonia or something she picks on the streets, then she regenerates into a toddler like Mels (Mels words).
- ""Somehow"" she jumps in time to the 80's or 90's (that's a mistery yet... at least for me... but I suppose the Doctor could take her after her regeneration and leave her in the right moment and placer for her to meet her parents... well, after he knew that part of the history) where she is adopted by a family in Ledgeworth and makes friends with her parents when they're children...
- During the events of ""Let's Kill Hitler"" she regenerates into River Song and use the rest of her regenerations in saving the life of the Doctor (Or that we think)
- River Song goes to the Luna University, acquires a doctorate on archeology, it's collected by The Silence to kill The Doctor, marries him, has many adventures together (like ""The picnic on Asgard"", ""Easter Island"" and ""Jim the Fish""), participates on the events of the Pandorica, goes to Demon´s Run and reveals her true identity, assist to the death of the Doctor on Lake Silencio and fights The Silence in 1969 (while her younger self is on the astronaut suit), then goes to The Bizantium, turns into a Professor, see her parents for last time in the events of ""The Angels take Manhattan"", have on last night with the Doctor at the ""Singing Towers"" and finally goes to the Library.
- Even if she didn't use all his regenerations saving the Doctor, on the chapter ""Forest of Death"" we see River Song finally dying; her body dissapear and only her consciousness remains inside CAL. There's no more regenerations cause we saw her die

Then, there is no point in her history where she could be Oswin

The only point not so clear about her history is between Melody Pond dying at 1970 and Mels growing up in Ledgeworth at 90's, but at that point she was only a toddler, doesn't have ways to travel in time or space and it was yet condicioned to kill the Doctor, so it's difficult for her to have met him on that time without something nasty passing...

Problem is that no matter what the PM tries to do, he is fighting his own party who are being lobbied by companies who want this situation, purely to make more money while keeping the poor under their thumb (bit dramatic but you get the gist) Either that or they are busy plotting what they can do in order to extend their rule for another 4 years.

I can come up with lots of viable economic policies, and this is from someone who has no idea what economics are (apart from if you are spending more than your bring in then you are in trouble, along with storing trouble by squeezing the cash cow a little too hard makes them stop paying)

Until someone decides to come clean to the public, offer a viable alternative while making it clear this is going t hurt a LOT of people, but will benefit us all in the end, nothing much will happen until the big crash comes around again. Just this time there a lot of powerful economies out there that will just snap up everything cheap.

At the end of the day the Tiger Economies learnt this in the 80-90s and sadly western civilistation chose to ignore the warning signs and this is why we are in this mess.

http://www.hofstra.edu/pdf/biz_MLC_Neelankavil1.pdf is interesting read on Economic repercussions, instead of people being taught to save, they were encouraged to spend on the 'Never Never' and this is why people find the purse strings a little tight at the moment as well.

If we went out there and got outclassed and outplayed, everybody here would be just fine with that. The reason we are continuously fed up if that our optimal result is out of hand before we even take the field, whether it be due to a mindset, tactics, lineup, whatever. 

We are in complete shambles, and I don't know what to say anymore. We continue to hold on to some fading hope that Chelsea's ability alone will help them roll over every opponent. Guess what? Team chemistry and a good manager go pretty far, and sometimes come hand in hand. Do our players even want to play for Rafa anymore? 

Finally, the one thing I hated hearing over and over today was, ""Chelsea were not ready for the dogfight that the Romanian side was going to put up."" Really? Really!? This team is in the Europa League for a reason. Furthermore, they have their domestic league and this competition. You think that they're just going to roll over? At home? Accept defeat? Ya, surely they shouldn't even take the field. They turned around a 2-0 against Ajax and are perfectly capable of getting a result. Somebody should have told Rafa and our squad that before they even got on the plane. 

With play like today, we'll be lucky to stay within 3 goals against United. They just went out and got knocked out of a competition. How will they respond to a loss? Hard play, making an immediate, powerful response to an unfavorable result, and passion. How will we respond to a loss? As early as 6 months ago, we'd still be feeling confident.

Lucas over Parker.  Gerrard and Dembele is a tough one since they're playing very different roles.  Gerrard obviously is the better overall player throughout his career, but if we're talking about current form and talent level, Dembele is an absolutely excellent player.  I'd take Gerrard, wouldn't begrudge a Spurs fan for taking Dembele.

Walker has been poor this year, so Johnson obviously.  I think with Agger's in a poor run of form I'd take Vertonghen at the moment.  I really don't know how Dawson and Assou-Ekotto so I can't comment on them.  I'm fine with Enrique, but a bit nervous about Carra, especially against this quick Spurs team.

Ibra is a good striker, but for me, he's to old now. I'd rather dish out the money for either Cavani or Falcao. 

I'd also like to see another CDM, as Barry is getting older and might be leaving soon, and Rodwell is obviously not consistent because of injuries. Kondogbia and Pogba are two people I'd love to see in the middle. They're both big, young, and have good strength to them. I'd like to see Pogba more (even though he's less likely to come), but I'd be happy if we got Kondogbia.

Another younger Centre-Back would be good too. I like Marquinhos from Roma. Reminds me of Thiago Silva, both being fast. His defending would obviously have to be stronger to be near Thiago's level, but they seem similar.  

Lastly, I'd want a wide man that Roberto would actually play. I'd love to see Reus come, but he just transferred to his hometown club, so that seems slim. 

If we just got one of these people, I'd be happy, but obviously I'd like to seem them all come :)",0,1362687182,null,0,false,0,c8rke4m,t3_19v2zq,t1_c8rke4m,t3_19v2zq,null,1431514018,4,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,4

true,[deleted],null,null,"Read team histories before becoming a supporter. From your question you clearly haven't. Benitez used to coach another EPL team, Liverpool some years ago. During his tenure there he is rumored to have made offensive comments playing CFC once. Flash forward to the present, Chelsea starts last season with Andre Villas Boas as manager. He is pretty lacking and ends up being sacked by Chelsea's Russian billionaire owner, Roman Abromovich. AVB is replaced with Roberto Di Matteo, a former CFC player legend. He wins both the FA Cup and the best cup, the Champions League, a first for Chelsea. Fans loved this guy, as did I. He was charismatic, humble and kind through and through. This season he suffers a few bad games in Chelsea's typical winter slump and Roman replaces RDM with Benitez. Yup, that Spanish Liverpool coach who supposedly insulted us is now replacing our CL winning coach and player legend, RDM. You can imagine where the anger begins. Benitez, while statistically not a bad coach, is loathed at Stamford Bridge (our home pitch). His track record this season is subpar. Objectively, our players are not playing well and the entire team is lacking. But from the non-objective CFC fan, e.g. most fans who attend games and live in London, blame most problems on Benitez. He's not a great manager and replaced a fan favourite RDM. He's also leaving in May so some see that as little reason for him to really push the team, since he knows he's interim. At the end of the day, the team is in a slump and our owner treats Chelsea as his expensive money sink play hobby.

true,CrimsonTideBlueMoon,1970crest,,"mine has some contingencies, but here goes: 

IF Edin heads out: we'll need a third striker, and one who plays sharp succinct ball like our argentine duo up front.  Obviously we can put names like falco, cavani, and other Christ-like figures at the top of the list but I personally wouldn't mind Jovetic from Fiorentina.  We've done a lot of business with them recently (Nastasic, Savic) so the business relationship is there and we can pay for him.  So there's my striker choice.

IF Jack Rodwell continues to spend more time on the treatment table than the pitch: I want us to get another center back and here's why.  We should push Vinny up to defensive mid where I still think he would be better used (and it's MY wish list after all).  It appears as though we're thinking about making a move for (another) Arsenal player who plays centerback and I know we wanted somebody from Stoke earlier in the year but honestly I dont know enough about the market for CBs to really have any insight here.

**Also, the above will also be important IF Lescott continues to not get a sniff of playing time 
***And even though I love me some Kolo Toure, his lack of speed is eventually going to catch up with him, regardless of how well he continues to play

IF we sell off Nasri (which I don't think we should [yet]): we'll need another playmaker in the middle.  Silva plays better when he's got a sidekick to work with.  Personally I think we should just give Sinclair some god-forsaken playing time and add some width to the attack, but whatever.....As far as potential candidates, I dunno probably someone from the continent just because it seems to be the trend.

If the charity can get people to volunteer for tasks like cleaning, it means they don't have to pay for professional cleaning services out of peoples donations.

A low skilled occupation like cleaning does not require an internship or volunteering to get ahead. My problem is they could have advertised for volunteers to donate their time in other more meaningful ways. Cleaning their toilets is hardly a worthwhile way to spend your time helping. They could of devised a cleaning rotor, or something similar if the cost of hiring a cleaner is an issue. This is quite patently a recruitment firm taking advantage of the current economic climate. I also wonder how much they were paid to find these volunteer cleaners? 

I'm not upset, just frustrated that people are expected to work for free to get ahead in life. Some of us can't afford to work without wages, yet small businesses and even charities are increasingly taking advantage of these lengthy and unnecessary internships/volunteer placements.

Siggy looks fantastic with both a goal and a wonderful assist to Bale. The last few games he's really shown up for us, which is fantastic to see.

Bale scores when he wants, as usual. About the dive, there seemed to be contact, but it's unnecessary of Bale to fall like a sack of potatoes. Yellow card is justified, I think, so we'll have to do without him at Giuseppe Meazza. 

Both Parker and Dembele have been FANTASTIC, huge part of the reason that Inter have looked so dull. They're working like terriers in midfield, and pushing forward well when they're on the ball. 

Other than that, the team as a whole has performed well. Inter not looking up for it, which frankly doesn't surprise me. They are far from the same team we met in the Champions League. I'm hoping we can keep focus throughout the game and not let in a goal. If we can go to Italy without an away-goal against us we will probably go through to the next round.

When I went, they had a couple different packages. The basic one was that they would take my prescription and put that on my eyes. It was the cheapest. Then there was the fully mapped and ""improved"" method.

They also still do it the olde blade way, but the laser is much better and faster. Also the laser method has a lot smaller risk to it, can be used on a much greater range of eyes, and even has the added security of only being done on your eye, so you can't have someone else's mapping on your eyes.

Plus the doctor told me that it's so percise, that if they had to stop part way through, they could resume exactly where they left off without any issue. Recovery is also less with the laser.

true,not-so-dubious,null,null,"Put simply, UMS is the 'scaled' version of your mark. It's a means of standardising marks across different papers from different boards across different years and allows for comparisons to be made especially when difficulty varies from paper to paper... 

The UMS mark can be obtained by performing a calculation from the RAW mark you get. (Therefore, your UMS mark is not the same as the RAW mark)

When examiners set grade boundaries (grades A - E at AS or A* - E at A2), they also set two additional grades, the *N* and the *Cap* - both of which aren't awarded but are 'made up' for statistical reasons.

The one you are most concerned with is the cap.

**With grade boundaries, the cap mark is the RAW mark which equates to full UMS.**

For example, in my Economics exam, the A grade (80/100 UMS) was 55/75 RAW.

The cap grade (100/100 UMS) was set as 67/75. **Basically, if your RAW mark is greater than or equal to the cap mark, you've got full UMS.**

In my case, I have 100 UMS so I must have a mark between 67-75 out of 75 RAW.

**Usually (but not necessarily always), you can work out the CAP mark like so:**

CAP = (3xA) - (2xB)

I hope that helps. If you're still confused, feel free to ask, I'll try and explain it better!

By the way, (and most importantly) congratulations on achieving full UMS on your paper! What paper was it?

It is forced when these governments would still be standing without foreign intervention. Gadaffi would not have been toppled without the months of NATO bombing campaigns and the outside intelligence agencies directing the fighters, similarly the 'rebels' in Syria would have got nowhere without foreign funding and arming. 

These regime changes are not organic as occurred in Egypt where a mass uprising left the government no choice but to change, instead they're being forced by foreign powers and a large proportion of foreign fighters because of a larger geopolitical agenda.

Why are Liverpool in 7th if they have the 2nd or 3rd best squad in the country? Why do we get more shots on target  and concede fewer and with less possession? 

Either you have to accept that Spurs have a better squad or you have to accept that your squad is massively underachieving by being in 7th. 

No matter what happens in this match, we have the better team and the better players overall. Liverpool could beat us 5-0 and it wouldn't change that because they'd still be 9 points behind us. 

Why, if Liverpool have such an incredible squad, have they not beaten a team in the top 6 of the table? Why did they lose at home to Aston Villa and WBA? If Daniel Agger is a better defender than Jan Vertonghen, why doesn't he play like it?

See, I used to believe that all fans were more or less the same. That every group of fans had their little pockets of assholes (this part is true of course). But Liverpool fans have convinced me otherwise: they are legitimately that much dumber than any group of fans I've ever encountered in any professional sport.

I think your squad will look at this game as an opportunity for validation: a chance to beat a team high up in the table for the first time all season.

I expect Liverpool to dominate possession but your team leaves tons of gaps in defense which we will probably exploit at least once on the break.

Defensively we're far the better team. Even in the comfortable thrashing of a sorry Wigan, Reina was tested repeatedly and produced several top saves to keep the scoreline as it belonged. 

We've improved a lot at cutting out cute little combination play from teams. That doesn't worry me much. What worries me is Gerrard lobbing in balls over the top to Suarez and Sturridge. Lloris will have to be at his best to deal with this threat, and someone is going to have to put pressure on Stevie G.

Doesn't matter how you try to spin it, an Australian talk show does not represent the opinion of most Syrians.

&gt; Gaddafi categorically would not have fallen without foreign help, the SAS were on the ground from the very beginning training and directing the rebels, the US was sending in Arms and I watched for months as NATO would first bomb area to destruction then send in the rebels as their grounds troops. The rebels would have got nowhere without first an area being obliterated from the sky and even then it took months and billions in foreign spending.

The Libyan rebels took over half the country in the first month or two. That's not going nowhere, that was HUGE. Besides, there was huge support in Tripoli and many other cities but the residents were too scared to fight. It was completely evident by how quickly Tripoli fell.

If you really want to spend your time volunteering for a charity, you could do so much more worthwhile work. That's all I'm saying, hence cleaning charity toilets, no matter how useful it may be, pales in comparison to these other forms of volunteer work. You could fundraise, help with admin, creating awareness, organise events and so forth.

I am being ridiculous, but seriously, I get what you mean, clearly volunteering for a charity, or gaining some sort of meaningful experience looks better on your CV than sitting about complaining about not having a job.

You might not frame it in those terms, but ultimately this is how you are thinking. This line of reasoning has several major flaws. If you want less tax money spent on welfare because the recipients do not contribute as much to that tax revenue pot, you morally enable even higher contributors than you, say for example celebrities, to say that because they contribute more to the pot than you, they don't want money spent on the tax-funded facilities you use. That obviously isn't acceptable. Moreover, you approach completely ignores the base concept behind tax - everyone paying some tax in some capacity is entitled to benefit from it. And everyone, even the people you despise the most, is contributing to tax revenue, be it through VAT, PAYE, or any of the other ways. Tax revenue is not a personal savings account that the government holds in trust and drip-feeds back to you, nor should it ever be. The moral principal of tax is that humans have rights beyond what their financial situation might be able to sustain.

* This move puts pretty much everything that Spurs are about in perspective.
* Dembele dodges past a player, finds a ball through two players to unleash Lennon.
* Lennon uses pace to make space for himself and generate the time needed to look up and pick out a pass to Defoe.
* Defoe is in the right position, has the ability and agility to turn and shoot in a second.
* Sigurdsson is aware, jumps high up to not block the shot - this is commendable, not easy to jump that high when Defoe turns that fast.
* Siggy then has the experience and stability of mind to follow up the shot and slot it past the keeper.

A really brilliant move, I think it's one of the best we've scored all season even though it's a simple tap in just because of everything and everyone that was involved. I might get a downvote for saying this, but I'm glad Bale wasn't involved in that move because then we'd have assholes saying ONE MAN TEAM THE MOVE WAS ALL ABOUT HIM TROLOOLOLLOLOOL. Fuck them.

I don't mean to diss Ade or jump on the anti-Ade bandwagon but had Ade been on the pitch, he probably wouldn't have been in that position and had he been in that position, there's no way he'd have got that shot away. Good to see Defoe isn't taking time to settle back in.

""Doctor Who"", with all his versions over the decades, is still one continuity. Yeah, it's a complex continuity, but if you stick with it, it all makes sense. Well, in the reality of the show. Well... depends on which universe you're in. *Well...* it's all the same. I know that something I saw with The First Doctor is still relevant to The Eleventh Doctor. Continuity is very important to me. I don't want to invest the time and effort experiencing a story's history only to find out that portions of it don't count. I've seen all the episodes since 1963 and I'm glad it's all relevant.

But my love of continuity keeps me from listening to the audio dramas and reading the novels/comics. I mean, I know they have their own continuity, but it seems they're separate from the show.
