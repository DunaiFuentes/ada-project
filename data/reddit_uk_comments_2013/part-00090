Hey, you never know when the next Sappho fragment will pop up, we've got to be prepared.

To be fair though, impractical  academic subjects like classics still have a lot of earning potential - the demand for writing, media and teaching  Latin is increasing quite rapidly in NICs and the far-east.

These 'doss subjects' are required if you like living in a culturally vibrant country with good TV, music and literature (Which also has it's economic advances if you believe all that stuff about the 'soft power' Britain has through the arts).

Also, failing that, it's a good degree to teach people the basic literacy/ rhetoric skills to be a soulless office drone.

It's further complicated because somebody might have had a poor school education, leaving them in a position where they barely scraped through university and didn't too well afterwards, despite trying very hard. Conversely, somebody else might have dossed through university and got a top paying job at daddy's company. There are far too many factors at play for any practical policy to do justice to all.

On another level, it seems unfair that university tuition fees be subsidised by the tax payer at all - why should somebody who leaves school and goes into work be paying taxes towards a typically wealthier (especially in the long run) university student?

----
**The covering letter**
----

&gt;Dear Fellow Shareholder,

&gt;The Everton Football Club Company Limited was formed in 1892 to finance the building of Goodison Park and limit the financial liability of the club members in the new world of professional football. The Chairman, George Mahon, is on record as arguing for the newly minted shares to be distributed as evenly as possible among the members to maintain democratic accountability.

&gt;The Directors of the new company remained accountable to their shareholders (the Members of the company) through the Annual General Meeting (AGM), a tradition and practice that continued for over 100 years until 2008 when a change in the Companies Act (2006) removed the legal requirement on our current Board to hold the AGM.

&gt;Sadly, and although this tradition could have, and should have, continued the Board chose at their earliest convenience to change the Company's Articles of Association to remove the need for an AGM.  The Board did this without giving prior notice to you, the members, and without any subsequent justification of their action.

&gt;In 2009 and 2010 the club held “Shareholder Forums” as a watered down substitute for the AGM where the number of attendees was limited by the club and the formal rules and legal framework that govern an AGM were absent. Even this limited option was not provided to you in 2011 or 2012 and there has been no opportunity at all for the members of the company to question the Directors who manage it on your behalf.

&gt;Since 2009 the Everton F.C. Shareholders' Association have, on your behalf, privately petitioned the Chairman and the Chief Executive to reverse their stance on the AGM. We have raised the issue in face-to-face meetings and we have written letters and emails, most recently after our own AGM in August of this year. We have received no indication that the Board are willing to acknowledge their traditional and moral obligation to be accountable to you, their members. Indeed the Company Secretary has formally notified us that the Board has currently no intention of re-instating the Annual General Meeting.

&gt;It is therefore with deep regret that we believe the only course of action now open to us is to seek your qualified approval and support for the enclosed Requisition that seeks to force the Board, through the will of the membership, to call an Extraordinary General Meeting.

&gt;Please read the Requisition carefully and give it your fullest consideration as we truly believe that this is very important to the future of the club that we love and that your personal support is vital. Note that we are only asking for the Board of our Club to answer simple questions on the financial performance of the Company and to permanently reinstate the AGM.

&gt;We all know that our football club faces great, and growing, challenges in the modern game. How we face those challenges together – Fans, Shareholders and Directors – is of concern and interest to us all. We believe that your opinions should be heard by the Board, and we believe that Annual General Meetings are the proper and appropriate forum to voice them.

&gt;A short survey is also enclosed with this letter, for your feedback, together with an application form for membership of the Association.

&gt;Please sign and return the enclosed Requisition for an Extraordinary General Meeting in the pre-paid envelope as soon as you can, and if possible not later than December 10th If you wish to return the survey and/or membership application, please send them in the same envelope.

&gt;James Asquith, Honorary Secretary
&gt;On Behalf of the Everton FC Shareholders’ Association

The problem is that this can't be argued for every single degree that students can do in university so we end up with this institution that we are pretty sure is good for our society, but not necessarily equally good for everyone and perhaps completely pointless in some cases.

We make GCSE level a requirement for all children (and therefore free) so perhaps it's time to acknowledge that GCSE just isn't good enough any more and to increase the basic minimum requirement for everyone to A-levels or even university!

true,Clarkinho,lfc68,,"I have to strongly disagree. I would suggest the complete opposite - I'm in the process of doing my coaching badges and that is the general consensus. 

Those types of players are mostly suited to four man midfields where the traditional 'center mid' is used. Systems are becoming much more specific with what kind of players are used. A five man midfield or even a 3 man where all three are in the middle needs specifically defined roles. A box to box role or a complete mid role just leaves holes and gaps. We do drills entirely based on that position where the idea is to obtain possession and attack wide. It's that players job to get the ball and give it. After that it's his job to get the ball and give it again :) 

I've seen the likes of Kedhira mentioned above and that is a prime example of how to undermine this position. He is a center mid with defensive qualities. A holding mid, or at least the type we play has very limited (but very instrumental) responsibilities. 

The only situation where we would play the box to box type role is actually sitting at the top of the triangle. These players are expected to pick up the ball both high and deep and  create - And Wanyama is not suited to that position. These are basically solely attacking and creative players like iniesta, mata, silva and erriksen. 

Outdated formations like 4-4-2 used traditional midfielders but it is rare you see any teams using it anymore. United were a fine example up until this year. I would suggest having a look at Rodgers article on our system its somewhere deep in the LFCTV website but I'd say you can find it. I think it's called tiki taka part two and it explains the roles in the system. I think it even breaks them into zones. 

No longer do we see the traditional box to box midfielder or the traditional fullback or center forward - They've mostly been replaced by the likes of holding mids, Inside forwards, Wing backs etc

Hazard, Mata, Oscar, Moses and Torres when he drops back are all likely to take up spaces between our midfield and our defence (depending on who plays for them). And with possibly Lampard and Ramires coming from deep we need all the stability in the defensive role. Sandro would be made for this game, but we don't have him. Parker has to start if fit (preferably with Dembele, but failing that I think I'd go with Holtby over Huddlefro).

Also we need width, the centre of the pitch is going to be so congested, especially if Lennon isn't fit. We can't expect both fullbacks to be bombing up and down for 90 mins when they have so many attacking talents to cope with all game.

A companion with a partner, children, a good job, and their own home isn't going to risk all that for adventures with a space man.  Its also not that accurate if we look at Clara who seems quite happy with her life.

There is also the mistake about saying that the Doctor only cares about Clara because of her mysterious nature.

If Azpi does start tomorrow, which I'm going to assume he does do, I'd like to see this:

Cech

Azpi-Cahill-Ivanovic-Cole

Lampard-Luiz

Ramires-Mata-Hazard

Ba/Torres

The way I see it, it's absolutely vital that Ramires starts this game. I'm not entirely sure whether he'll drop into DM or on the wing but in either position he'd be able to track back and help while providing that pace on the counter. If he does drop back to DM then I'd expect Lampard to lose his spot and Oscar to start on the wing as he did last time against Tottenham.

I'm usually a fan of Luiz at CB in his natural position and pretty much insist that he starts there all the time.... but for this specific game it might be better to just have a solid back line with Luiz placed in front. I'm not sure JT has the pace that some of Tottenham's players have but a combination of Terry/Cahill/Ivanovic would most likely be fine.

Not bothered about who starts either but I think, considering the games coming up (Aston Villa/Benfica) it's probably best if Torres starts and then Ba starts against Villa.

&gt;Spurs have a net spend of just £7.6M since the 2008/09 season, Chelsea have a net spend of £166M for the same period. Over achieving?

""Journey to the center of the TARDIS"" didn't even happen. It was information for information sake. Cool, we got to see part of the pool and the Library. Who cares? The big reveal was that Clara learns The Doctor's name and that The Doctor doesn't understand Clara... We'll no shit, idiots. He only mentions it once an episode. And then you take her knowing that away... Super cool. Great plot development, there.

So yeah, I feel pretty qualified to tell people when the poor writing of a show that was fairly we'll written has gotten so terrible they should be outraged. The only thing that could make it any worse would be more fez references... 

What is there to actually like about this series so far? It hasn't gone anywhere or done anything. ""The Great Intelligence"" survived. Cool. The Doctor doesn't understand how Clara exists. Wonderful for him. The TARDIS dislikes Clara, which happens to be the only actual mystery so far this series, and the show isn't scary or suspenseful.

Episode about a ghost: not the least but scary.
Episode where the Doctor is captured... Wait, that's not scary at all because be first saw him that episode after he had been rescued. Boring.
Episode where The TARDIS basically wrecks and is dying with Clara trapped inside with... Future burnt versions of people that never actually happened, thus creating SO many paradoxes... But don't worry, none of that ever happened.
Episode where people get downloaded into the internet: this episode was the best so far, in my opinion, if you ignore the motorbike that drive up a building...
And last, but certainly least, an episode in a Soviet Sub that has a proper Martian. A famous warrior, in fact, who lives by a code... Who happens to conveniently ignore that code, thus saving mankind.

true,MathFabMathonwy,,LLanelli,"Up until not too long ago, there was a distinct spiritual/religious aspect to the culture, as evidenced by the hymns sung at rugby matches. The Methodist and Baptist revivals, though long past, left much of the culture in their wake.

Also, the poetry of the Welsh language. As Tolkien had it: Welsh is beautiful. It's made for poetry and expressions that stir the fires of the soul. A culture is hugely influenced by its language, and this is certainly true for Wales. We are a poetic people.

No doubt, our culture has been long influenced by the majesty of our countryside. Even Welsh people who have lived their whole lives in Wales know and appreciate that Wales is, for the most part, a stunningly beautiful piece of real estate (Blaenau Ffestiniog notwithstanding). It also possesses a sense of mystery or ancientness, as if we are but newly-come visitors to a land old beyond reckoning. The sense of awe and humility this engenders, of being blessed to call such a place home, no doubt, contributes to the poetic and spiritual nature of the Welsh people.

Sadly, I fear globalisation and materialism are sweeping these long-cherished aspects into the annals of times past. Now the Welsh are not to be distinguished so easily from any other western people.

Another element would be that large portions of the Welsh are poorly educated and generally unwell. Poverty will do that to a people. Material wealth has never been the lot of the Welsh as a whole. The industrial revolution still leaves it scars: even if the ruination of the valleys has largely been healed, the same has yet to happen in the minds of many of the descendants of those who worked long hours in the mines and factories of Wales. For many, there was (and is) even a pride to be found in their working class roots, as if it is a cultural marker, and the intelligent soul was/is often hounded out or ridiculed for being cut from a different cloth.

Edit : The cliché spends too much posts are really stupid considering 90% of our recent signings have been brilliant. Even Torres and Sheva are transfers on which Roman would risk his money all over again. To make a brand image and to get your club listed and recognized in arguments when someone says ""this is a big club"" you need to have these big named players come and go through the club. Why do you think the Chinese leagues, MLS and smaller teams want the big stars who are past their prime? They want their club to be out there. Just an example of Torres is how big of his fan base is who we reached out to, in fact I would go as far as saying that Juan Mata is here because we had Torres and now he isn't even playing that badly. We paid the majority of the fees for Torres's name. 

Madrid had every big named player there was pretty much throughout big patches of their history. Ex: Ronaldo, Figo, Maka, Seedorf, Beckham, Roberto Carlos, Laudrup etcetera and now anytime one of these player's name is brought up in any commentary, argument, discussion, books, movies, biography guess which club they all are linked to regardless of how they played at that club, Real Madrid.

true,OrestesM,null,null,"I think you misinterpreted what I am trying to say. I am not making a point of British vs Minorities, I am not even speaking of minorities themselves, I am talking about groups of people who go to another country and create a cultural bubble within and just stick together without taking in the culture of the country they are in. Whether it's people coming into Britain, or British going into another country (Like Spain for example). But I am not saying anyone should do anything! Personally I don't mind either way because, I don't really care. But at the same time, these communities can't be surprised if people from the country you're living in get a bit annoyed with you for excluding yourself, because that's human nature.

I think a lot of leftist Brits are culturally more intolerant to themselves not blending in when they go abroad, than the other way around. Which in my opinion is good to be self-critical, but you should also be equal about it. Otherwise you're ideologically saying 'it's okay for them to do it, but it's not cool for us to do it because we should know better (because *we are better*)'. 

So anyway to conclude, I'm not saying anyone should do anything, I am just saying that the second people separate themselves based on culture or skin colour, whether it's for a good reason or not, then they create an environment that allows for discrimination. And this works both ways mind you, whether you are the majority or minority. Otherwise there wouldn't be a need for this bubble. But anyway I like discussing this stuff because it's stuff most people are too scared to discuss it but I do sense a lot of social anxiety within people trying to be PC. Everyone is polite on the surface, but once you get close enough with someone you hear all the obscenities and semi-racist jokes that come out.

true,Machinax,dalek,Dalek,"&gt;So... You've chosen to ignore the throwback intro entirely?

You mean having the face in the intro? I was never a fan of it in the classic series, but I'll say that the way it's been done in Series 7B is a lot more preferable to old men staring intently at the camera. The image of Smith's face is much quicker in duration, and it feels like it's actually part of the scenery, instead of just being slapped on. 

I loved the suspense in ""Journey"". I'll admit that the ""History of the TARDIS"" didn't make much sense, but I thought the resolution was all right. It's preferable to the BIG resets of Series 3, 5 and 6. This was something small and contained within the episode itself, so it worked for me. 

&gt;So yeah, I feel pretty qualified to tell people when the poor writing of a show that was fairly we'll written has gotten so terrible they should be outraged. 

No you don't, you goose. You're not an expert. You're a fan with an opinion. I'm a fan with an opinion. You're no more right than I am, I'm no more wrong than you are. My qualifications are no greater than yours, your perspective is no more insightful than mine. 

&gt;What is there to actually like about this series so far?

Well, speaking purely as an unqualified fan of some television shows, I enjoy that Clara hasn't expressed any romantic interest in the Doctor. I like that we've seen Clara scared, confused and occasionally frustrated by the Doctor. I like that the resolution of ""Hide"", while not perfect, was genuinely unexpected. I appreciate that ""The Crimson Horror"" played down the idiocy of Strax and the pseudo-sapphic relationship between Vastra and Jenny in favour of...actually telling a story. 

I really, really, REALLY like that Steven Moffat has written only a minimal number of episodes this season. 

&gt;How do you not see how bad this is?

true,dave8001,null,null,"I think series 7 is by far the best series we have had since series 4 (at least).  And by this; I specifically mean since the full introduction of Clara.  For these reasons: 

1.  The scripts have been more true to Doctor Who than they had previously in series 5 and (specifically) series 6.  Now; I like a good story arc; being a huge smallville and x-files fan (to name but a couple); but I think they were too heavy with this in series 6 and almost shoe-horned it in.  Going back to individual stories with undertones of a light arc has been ultimately refreshing for the show.  

2.  Good use of guest/recurring writers. Instead of having different writers per episode; overseen by Moffat; with him being the only recurring one...we have Haifa number of writers doing 2 episodes each. This has allowed small carry-overs between scripts. 

3. Matt Smith's acting has improved consistently each year since he begun and 2013 has been no different.  His monologue in the Rings of Akhaten was spectacular; and his comedy performance when describing Winifred Gillyflower was spot on.  

4.  Good use of the budget in order to increase the quality of programming. In previous series you can obviously tell when an episode has had a smaller budget than others; though in 7 this has been much more subtle. 

5. Credit changes. We have seen an improvement in the opening credits of the show; making it seem more mature than it has since 2010. 

6.  The TARDIS interior has been giving us a nod to the classic era.  

7.  The call-backs to classic era on the run up to the 50th anniversary has been fun.

true,Annaeus,,Maths Teacher,"That's the 'general principle' of the marking scheme - method marks are only given for questions where method is required. Here's the 'general principle' from the front of the exam paper itself: ""In all calculations, show clearly how you work out your answer."" So the method is explicitly required for all questions. Confusing! To resolve this confusion, you have to look at the marking schemes in detail, question by question.

If you do, there is always one mark for the correct answer (the accuracy mark, usually labelled 'A1'). If you use a clearly incorrect method, and happen to get a lucky correct answer, you may not get this mark at all, but unless the method is obviously wrong the examiner will 'imply' a correct method and give the accuracy mark.

But if the question has more than one mark, the rest is for method in a variety of different ways - specific stages of process, identifying specific information from the question, marks that are or are not dependent on correctly completing the previous step, prescribed methods, proscribed methods, and so on. Take a look (just as an example) at the mark scheme you linked to, question 4b. Seven different ways of getting the first method mark, the second method mark awarded only if the first one was given, and the accuracy mark for the correct answer.

The point is that the method marks are *only* awarded if the stated elements of the method and working are seen. If they're not there, then you lose those marks.

In some places the letters 'oe' meaning 'or equivalent' are given, so as long as it's a method that's vaguely reasonable you get the marks. But some kind of method and working has to be there.

The 'principle' is that method does not always have to be shown, but like the ""i before e except after c"" rule of spelling, there are far more exceptions to this rule than there are examples of it. You have to spend some time working with the marking scheme itself to realise this - and I've worked with the marking schemes for several different units and dates, and the pattern is consistent: even if you get the right answers, you could still fail if you don't show any working; it's not just a case of including the method in case you get the answer wrong, you need to show it anyway.",0,1367956558,null,0,false,0,c9uakut,t3_1c7u4g,t1_c9uakut,t1_c9u1h6i,null,1431270861,1,false,GCSE,t5_2u3gk,1

Tennant has two things going that made it really hard for some people to get over him.  He is traditionally handsome, so the ladies were all over him.  Then he leaves and silly looking big head Matt Smith takes over, so a lot of those women who were swooning for David were like ""Who's this guy?""  What they fail to realize is that most Doctors are kinda strange looking by traditional standards, the exceptions so far being Davison and Tennant. (BTW, I think Matt Smith is handsome is his own way)

Also, when Tennant was going to regenerate, he went out crying... he didn't want to go.  Eccleston went out with dignity, trying his best to assure Rose that everything would be okay, and feeling proud of his accomplishments... but Tennant goes out crying because he didn't want to die, thus tugging viciously at the heartstrings of all the Tennant fans watching.

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; How do you retain the link between the MP and the local constituency under PR though?

Honestly, I don't want that. 

MPs don't discuss actual political matters the things the vote on, with their constituents, because they're obliged to toe the party line and defer to the whip.

I've heard of a constituent being chucked out of an MP's surgery because he kept trying to talk about national policy - about taxes or monetary policy or foreign wars or something.

So the MP becomes this fixer, this guy with influence because he can make a lot of noise and people listen. He knows someone who knows someone.

If your local NHS Trust is messing you about, your MP's influence is that he hobnobs with the minister for health, or can condemn this in the local newspaper - it's not that he has any statutory right to ~~interfere~~ effect change.

true,Clarkinho,lfc68,,"Okay, the fact that you used Alonso as an examples of players that play all roles exceptionally shows me where you're coming from. Alonso plays a very specific role, just because he is creative does not mean he plays other roles. You will never see him in a more advanced role than holding. We're talking about bringing in a player to play a specific position and no matter how complete the player, they will never be 'exceptional' in all roles. You will never find a player who spreads a ball like Alonso or Xavi, can carry it like Gerrard and thread it like Fabregas because a jack of all trades is a master of none. Wanyama may decent going back and forward but he will never be able to play that role like a dedicated holding mid would.

You're also citing players who play in totally different systems. You haven't grasped that we play a very well defined system with very specific roles.

I assume you mean Stevie for the one in our team...What is your idea of exceptional? Steven Gerrard will never ever play the static holding role as well as Scholes or Alonso, no matter how great a complete player he is. He will never have the decision making ability that they do, ever and it's not something that can be taught.  

I really hate arguing, that's why I don't do it on here. You keep pointing out that midfielders should be more dynamic than ever yet roles are becoming more specific. before we had the center backs(maybe a sweeper) full backs, two centre mids (one focused on defending and one higher) wingers/wide midfielders and two strikers, one supporting and a center forward. 

This is when players needed to be more dynamic as they had a lot of roles to play and space to fill.There is a reason systems have changed and I don't think you understand ours fully to be honest. I think a lot of people and pundits (Jamie redknapp to mention one) talk bout our system and great passing blah blah blah, assume it's a regular 4-3-3 and move on. You are undermining the complexities of football to the extreme here. You have this idea that the midfield role is evolving but you don't actually understand why.

I have to leave this because it is changing into a different debate now and to be honest I'm Wrecked. Time for Bed methinks

This is a case where I feel the benefits outweigh the privacy implications so I'd agree with a couple of provisions.

1. The video is cryptographically signed to prevent tampering

2. A unique identifier is stamped into the video

3. A timestamp driven by a central source is stamped onto the video

4. The cameras are of sufficient quality to be useful so at least 720p.

5. The cameras retain at least 7 days of footage which can't be deleted

6. The police can seize the footage with a warrant.

7. The camera and installation is of sufficient quality that it can be considered as evidence.

8. Police are forced to review video evidence as the result of a complaint of dangerous driving e.g. from a cyclist. With some penalty for abuse of the system.

9. The cameras are phased in over a period of time

10. There are multiple suppliers to prevent a monopoly

true,typesoshee,null,null,"Especially relevant because this example is about an American immigrant moving to China and  the above posts are imagining a Brit moving to Italy.  These are NOT the same thing.  A Brit moving to Italy hardly counts as ""immigration"" when you're talking about the kind of immigration that gets on the news or that is discussed politically.  A Brit moving to Italy is probably as challenging as a Mumbai person moving to Chennai (I'm making that up, I don't know much about Indian culture at the state level).  A better comparison would be moving to Argentina maybe (for the possible latent animosity from recent history) or Pakistan (people can immediately tell you're not one of them, and the culture feels radically different from your previous home) - with the most important thing being your job prospects are low income types.  You're automatically shut out from better jobs because you don't have the language or background.  You can speak the language well enough to get by, but that's it.  Most better jobs require high fluency for someone to like you enough to hire you, and that's extremely difficult for an immigrant to achieve.  

The more I think about it, I think the key is what kind of jobs are open to you.  If you have a good university education, can speak the language, and are moving ""to expand your career options,"" then you are not really immigrating... you're moving for a job.  And because of your education and job prospects, you're a lot more culturally fluid and open.  If you have none of these and you're moving ""to improve you and your family's life,"" you're immigrating.  Less education and job prospects probably mean that you're also less culturally fluid.

[This](http://imgur.com/aoGdXhy) is a chart from The Chemical Engineer issue 862 about the impact of various renewables compared to the current UK grid. Whilst CO2 emissions are lower than the current grid far more rare elements are used alongside being more polluting in a number of different metrics. Of course this isn't to say that renewables are worse than our current generation tecniques, far from it, it just shows that the environmental side of things isn't as simple as first seems.

My problem with renewables is the scale of the things. According to the [US Energy Information Administration](http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=104&amp;t=3) a typical nulear powerplant generates 12.2 billion kilowatt-hours over the course of a year.

Doing some quick calculations using [this](http://windeis.anl.gov/guide/basics/) data, and taking the 750kW turbine, the maximum yearly output of a single turbine is just 6 570 000 kWh/yr. That means you'd need over 1850 turbines to replace a single nuclear powerplant. That doesn't take into account downtime for maintenance, the fact that they won't be running at 750kW most of the time and lack of wind. It makes no economic or environmental sense why people would support wind turbines over nuclear power plants.",0,1367965834,null,0,false,0,c9ue52d,t3_1dto6r,t1_c9ue52d,t1_c9udexw,null,1431269109,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

AVB's strategy regarding Bale has been to coach him to play better through the middle and put him in the best position to succeed. That's the job of a manager.

If people are going to blame him for poor form from certain players, he should be praised for good form from others. 

Bale himself has said how big a difference AVB has made to his form, and his celebration against WHU pretty much showed you what the boss has meant to him.

I think those who watch Bale on a week-in-week-out basis would agree that the biggest improvements in his game this season are tactical and raising his consistency level. His movement, positioning, ability to cope with teams marking him out of games have all improved to a staggering degree and a lot of that is unquestionably down to the coaching he's received. 

There are plenty of anecdotes about AVB coaching players to improve their form / overall game. Of course Rodgers has undeniably done the same thing, but you're being colossally unfair to just dismiss our manager's contributions.

&gt;The TIEA represents an important step in facilitating business flows between the Isle of Man and the Czech Republic and means that, on request, the Isle of Man will exchange bank and other infomation relating to both criminal and civil tax matters.

&gt;Any country requesting information under the TIEA must provide to the competent authority the reasons why the information is being requested.

Re: ""The Beast Below"". 

First, the premise of the episode makes no sense: I'm willing to squint my eyes at your soylent green premise. But if the Beast never, ever eats the children you offer to it why would you keep trying to feed it children for hundreds of years?

Second, the episode requires Amy to have a really deep understanding of the Doctor's personality that she hasn't earned yet. (It gets it half right by establishing the ""children crying"" thing, but then doesn't get the other half of it.)

Third, the history underlining the episode falls apart upon any kind of examination. And it kinda forces you to examine it because the entire episode is driven by the mystery of discovering that history. Evacuation of the Earth along national lines?

Why on earth should a manager be slated because he has a player capable of the sublime? It's total lunacy.

Bale has had just as many contributions because of the different way he's playing and because of tactical shifts by the manager. 

Against City he did fucking nothing until AVB shifted him to the right, where he assisted one goal and scored another. Against Southampton? Same thing: did fuck all for 85 minutes and then AVB made a tactical change which put him in a position to give us 3 points. 

You're woefully oversimplifying things to make a point. Bale has undeniably benefited from AVB's management. Putting him in a free role to unlock his full potential is something that he deserves credit for. Moving him around during games very specifically has directly led to some of these goals. 

Of course great individual players are going to create great individual moments and earn teams points, but it's asinine to use it to slag a manager.

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; I have no idea what sex you are, and males and females are equally capable of becoming hysterical. So I really don't know where this undertone of sexism is supposed to be coming from.

I believe that ""hysterical"" is well recognised within the feminist movement as being gendered.

I believe the etymology of the word refers to the womb, and the common use comes from the now-discredited medical condition ""female hysteria"".

I understand the word to be widely used against women as a ""tone argument"" and to dismiss legitimate concerns - ""calm down, you're acting hysterical"". 

It is not a word I would use rhetorically, for these reasons. 

I'm not convinced its worthwhile engaging with Salvaxe, but when she's schooling you in feminism - well, you should be buying the subreddit drinks for the next week.

Keep in mind that the DC number doesn't take nationality into account at all, so white American citizens make up even less than 40% of our nation's capital (weird how Americans are so unbothered by that fact).

*Literally thousands?* That's such a large number! Also, most people aren't scared by Poles. Well, racists are, but not much of anybody else. The United States takes in more legal immigrants than every other country on the face of the planet combined. We have a significantly higher proportion of immigrants than the UK does.

true,nssmuckers,null,null,"&gt; I am curious to know what any Spurs fans think though.

You will find exactly the opposite of what's being said in here. As I've written in another post, I think the thread is pretty inevitably an exercise in self-affirmation. 

I will say that I wanted Rodgers before the season began. I think he's a nice middle ground between the tactical dissertations of AVB and the arm around your shoulder ""fackin' run around lads"" of Redknapp. He's a sentimental manager who can be a bit cheesy at times, but he also knows how to get his team playing a specific way. 

Ultimately I do think Levy knows his stuff a lot more than I do and I think he's made the right decision. After initial struggles I think our squad has bought into AVB and his more continental style of management. He's a modern coach for a new modern training ground. 

We've taken more away points under AVB than we have in a long time and with 2 more games on the road to play. If we take 6 points from our final 3 games we'll probably miss out on CL football, but it will be a point total that would have earned us 3rd place in 2 of the past 3 seasons and 4th in the other. We've only lost by more than 1 goal 2 times all season, compared to 4, 4, and 7 under Redknapp. 

I'd also argue that the changes to our squad in the summer were even more drastic and damaging than those that LFC underwent. We lost our club captain and best defender, one of the best deep-lying playmakers in Europe, and our top scorer over the previous two seasons. He's got the best out of our best player and he's navigated constant injury crises and complete lack of form from any striker. He's kept us in range of our objectives in spite of not being reinforced significantly in January.

This is a subreddit that seemed to largely feel Liverpool had a better starting 11 ""across the board"" than us, and we've very rarely had access to our first 11 this season. If that's going to be the story, I think we've overachieved under AVB. I like BR, but I think our manager's ceiling is higher.

In academia it is feminism that studies gender roles. 

Who do you think came up with these kinds of ideas, about toys and role models influencing children this way, and their careers?  

I'm sure you're now going to dispute the matter, but this whole subject of gender roles is what everyone else calls ""a feminist issue"".

You're arguing a feminist position. I'm sorry for assuming you understood that.

&gt; ""You're … a bit hysterical. Calm down."" 

I'm really proud that you might say that to a bloke, but no-one else would. 

Whatever you think about ""normal everyday use"", you're wrong.

You shouldn't use that word to women you don't know (or people you don't know the gender of) unless they're physically in front of you screaming.

The pocket dictionary on my computer dedicates nearly 20% of its *hysteria* entry to the statement ""the term has a controversial history as it was formerly regarded as a disease specific to women.""

If you don't know this stuff, you're probably not qualified to talk about gender roles (your words: ""totally archaic gender roles …  still being mindlessly reinforced"").

I mean, you're right to think that we shouldn't be forcing gender roles on kids, but you're probably not going to be able to have a nuanced conversation on the matter if you don't know what a feminist is.

The fact is, even if we say we've progressed at a higher rate than those teams (I do not agree with this notion--it's debatable at best with Chelsea) we've come from a much lower standing and we still don't compete with either in terms of resources. 

To me, players like Vertonghen are what we need to aim for. Players good enough to play for bigger clubs but who value starting every game over maybe making more money. Of course Vertonghen probably would have started a lot for Arsenal this season with Vermaelen's horrid form, but going into the season it looked like he'd play more with us.

Mata is too big for us and too big for Arsenal. He's at a level where he can play every week for almost any team in the world, so he deserves to be compensated as such. 

Our status as a young improving team is indeed attractive to players. Eden Hazard was very clear that we were the team he wanted to play for until we imploded horribly and Chelsea won the CL.

That however only applies to players who are at smaller clubs or in smaller leagues who are looking to take the next step in their careers. A player like Juan Mata is already at a club where he makes more money and has a better chance at trophies. The notion that he'd ever want to join us is frankly laughable and impossible. 

Players like Christian Benteke are who we should be striving for. Benteke could probably go to a team like Arsenal but would he play every week? I don't think he would.

I mean, if you want to build a bridge, and you ask an engineer what kind of materials you use for that span, he'll give you an ""opinion"" based on science and facts and training.

Although obscure tropical diseases or rare genetic conditions may challenge a local GP, the ""opinion"" of an experienced doctor is similarly well-grounded and qualified. 

So your ""opinion"" on gender roles, isn't of the same kind of legitimacy as these, is it?

Your ""opinion"" on gender roles is actually just your *prejudices*, isn't it?

So sorry to be so direct, but if you haven't read a whole bunch of articles on this stuff then any way you try to legitimise your ~~prejudices~~ ""opinion"", it'll just be you pulling stuff out of your arse.

Yes, *obviously* the lack of women in science is due to the way society presents gender roles to children.

Well, duh!

No-one with a clue needs to be told this - if you just read the feminist columnists in your newspaper, assuming you take a serious newspaper, then you'd know this  stuff already. 

Yes, there has been loads of science on this subject over the past 3 or 4 decades but unlike, say, the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, it's really difficult to control for all variables in a society which contains millions of autonomous people. 

So there's unlikely to be a study that covers the *exact* situation of supermarket signage, but there are plenty of studies that cover children and imposed gender roles. 

Plenty of people have written about how they weren't allowed to play with certain kinds of toys when they were kids, because their parents imposed these ""these toys are for boys"" rules. We have [the well-documented example of a little girl being bullied because she likes Star Wars](http://edition.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/12/09/katie.starwars.geek/index.html). Having the supermarket label things as only good for boys or girls only helps perpetuate that. 

Reddiquette is bullshit anyway, but it talks about upvotes rewarding ""contributions to the conversation"", and using downvotes to hide comments that don't contribute.

""So the lack of women in science is due to gender signing of toys? LOL"" - not a contribution. 


No, Tesco shouldn't be forced to stop using these labels, they should do it because it's the right thing to do - because it's a tiny thing to change which will make society a tiny bit better.

Denmark is part of Scandinavia, geographically and culturally. I assure you, Denmark is not the odd one out — if anything, Sweden is, just because Norway and Denmark have a longer shared history, more similar languages, and really quite identical cultures, but we're talking extremely minor points here.

I could not name a single serious cultural difference between Denmark and Sweden in. Sure, one puts shrimp salad on its hot dogs and has a slightly bigger focus on heavy industry over agriculture, but you know, it'd be grasping for straws.

No. To you as a tourist maybe, but no. :)

&gt; architecture (Scandinavia tends to be more modern and clean and Britian tends to be more old and dirty)

To an extent, but I can't help but feel that Brits would have the same if you guys had the means. I mean, look at the Southbank in London and other wealthy places with modern architecture, you'll see exactly that.

This is what happened.  You made an *obnoxious* comment about dodging loan repayments and passing the burden onto wealthier graduates.  I pulled you up on it.  I was in no way rude to you, but I was downvoted because there is a lot of sympathy on this subreddit for your position, but not a lot of sympathy for mine.  I then broke the cardinal rule: don't complain about downvotes.  You seem to have then assumed that you have successfully fended off a troll, which I most assuredly am not.  But your original comment is still up there, and speaks for itself.

true,polostring,null,null,"I am not surprised by the inconsistency in the slightest, but I also do NOT see it as the root of the club's problems.  A wealth of new (young) players, a new (young) manager, and a fair share of injuries and suspensions; inconsistency should be expected.  In fact I think it is more a side effect of the real problems.

I just don't think the club is good enough yet.  The performances against the other top 8 clubs have been abysmal.  Teams that play overly physical--Stoke--or know the LFC squad well--West Brom--gave the club a lot of trouble this year.  I too am sometimes a little annoyed by all the ""5-0 to LFC with a Hendo hattrick"" talk in prematch threads, but that is just my opinion and I usually try to keep it to myself; I don't want to discourage happiness or enthusiasm for the club.  I am just befuddled a little when the only club we have routinely beaten is Norwich.    

Composure has been a big issue.  How many times have you wandered into a post-match thread and thought: ""Man, just not enough effort"", ""Dull"", ""No enthusiasm"".  I read it every week.  I think a lot of the team is too young and inexperienced.  This will hopefully improve with time.

I think the club is also still adapting to the new tactics and strategies of the manager.  Several times this year I have heard people praise Rodgers for good early substitutions or half time tactical changes.  I think with such a young/new squad these things fall on deaf ears sometimes.  Look at last week: as Everton bossed the midfield and took out Johnson and Enrique--the midfield and forwards struggled to adapt their play.  The only person up front who really looked to be trying to change the game was--unsurprisingly--Gerrard.

The carousel of first team players have taken their toll on team chemistry.  Sterilng, Coutinho, Sturridge, Borini, Lucas, Henderson, Skrtel, Downing, Enrique, etc.  How many of these players were considered automatic to make the team sheet during some stretch of the season?  How many missed long periods due to injury, falling out of form, transfers, etc?  This is a lot of change especially with a new manager and new system.

Transfers will continue to be an issue.  Not even detailing missteps over the past few years, there is a bigger more pressing issue.  This club is not a champions league club.  LFC haven't been a European regular since the second place finish in 08-09.  This is *definitely* hurting the club in the transfer market.  We have seen it happen several times with players like Sigurðsson.  I don't think players like Eriksen are coming to LFC.  Some club with Champions League football are going to snatch him up.  I would expect more ""smaller"" name players to come into the club, maybe even into the youth team like Texiera did last year.  This brings me to my last point...

...the youth team and reserves seem to be doing pretty well.  Players like Ibe, Pelosi (before the injury), Suso, Wisdom, etc. etc.  A lot of these kids show flashes of first team promise.  A little development, maybe a lone, and at least one or two could become first team regulars.

**TL;DR-ish -- I hope this isn't too negative, but I think LFC have a few significant problems.  However, I also think most of these problems are fixable and some will greatly improve even by August.**",0,1367978467,null,0,false,0,c9uiqpo,t3_1dw591,t1_c9uiqpo,t3_1dw591,null,1431266871,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8

true,Novatorian,tardis,TARDIS,"Though Moffat may be a great writer, he should not be the show runner. Moffat is good at filling 45 minutes with suspense and story, however, he is not very good at writing science fiction, especially family oriented science fiction. His use of love as the solve-all is a good idea, however, transitioning from Tennant's imperical and logical rants to loving the bomb away is rough. 

Frankly, Moffat has twisted Doctor Who into Moffat's Who, and it is not surprising. He has a sharp ego and a strange belief that he owns Doctor Who and Sherlock. 

See: http://www.blastr.com/2012/05/now-that-hes-seen-it-what.php 

Moffat worries Hollywood will ""tarnish"" his brand, ruin his Sherlock (though I'm sure Sir Doyle would like to argue Sherlock is his). I like to believe that Moffat has a strange disdain for Hollywood, so much that he is becoming his own monster. 

Take this for example: http://nerdbastards.com/2011/12/14/steve-moffat-discusses-next-years-doctor-who-slutty-titles-die-hard-no-more-two-parters/

So much. Too much. Slutty titles? Two parters don't save a penny, thus useless? And worst, Die Hard? Hollywood action 101. It isn't hard to notice the bump in production value as a smoke and mirrors game. Moffat is essentially Americanizing Doctor Who.

What hurts the most is the backhand homage to classic Who. The console, the outfits, etc... Everything but the content. Classic Who embodied reason, sure-footedness, and above all the proper wielding of knowledge. Making convoluted stories, and creating the rules of time and space on the fly isn't doing Who any favors. If anything, it alienates those who are looking for a wholesome, scientific family adventure. 

As for Moffat being sexist?

http://gnimaerd.tumblr.com/post/12280580585/steven-moffat-explains-why-hes-so-bad-at-writing-women

Yes.

""There’s this issue you’re not allowed to discuss: that women are needy.""

See: http://ofdiceandpenblog.blogspot.com/2012/12/sexism-in-steven-moffats-doctor-who.html 

This shows is his ""writing"" of female characters. They are nothing more than vacuous models and baby factories. Men are always their underlying goal, their quest. In series 5, Moffat even pulls out the great mystical pregnancy trope with Amy. Another human love romantic comedy story? 

http://www.digitalspy.com/british-tv/s7/doctor-who/news/a476748/doctor-who-finale-will-change-the-show-forever-says-steven-moffat.html

All of this culminates to ""The Name of the Doctor"", in which Moffat plans to ""change the course of Doctor Who forever"". As if he hasn't already. 

Doctor Who is, and was created, to be a children's show. Yes, I understand that things evolve. However Moffat is caught in a major clash between innovation and masturbation.

As for this season, it's not as dire as some may think. This is Rodgers' *first* season and for many on the squad, Rodgers' style, tactics, philosophy, etc. is a first for them. Surely the Liverpool FC reality show was a distraction, the Lucas injury and re-injury was unlucky, and it took some time for the likes of Downing and Henderson to establish themselves as regulars in the side. Couple that with some unlucky results and here we are.

I have to think that with this first year under everyone's belt, we should be able to build upon this and go from there.

Someone who plays wingback well must have aspects of a good defender and a good midfielder, in addition to great stamina.

true,grishnackh,uk,Hertfordshire,"I think your attitude that is unable to extricate someones sexual desires from their other works is pretty sickening, frankly. Roman Polanski raped a thirteen year old. Do I think thats acceptable? No. Do I think he was an excellent film-maker? Yes.

John Peel had sex with some underage girls. Do I agree with that? No. Do I think he was a fucking good DJ? Yes.  If you spend your entire life passing judgment on people because of a singular facet of their personality then you will have a very shallow life indeed. People do things that I am not ethically comfortable with, but that doesn't mean that their other works are automatically worthless. Vincent Van Gogh liked to frequent prostitutes, Lewis Carroll wrote Alice in Wonderland to woo a ten year old, and Faust from the band Emperor murdered a man principally because he was homosexual. I don't agree with any of those things, but that doesn't mean I am so blinkered by my opinion that I am unable to appreciate the work they did that was good. Grow up and realise that people do things that you won't like, and may find ethically repugnant like sleeping with underage girls (and yes, I did notice you imply that I thought it was OK because I appreciate his other work), but that doesn't mean that they are innately unintelligent or bad at what they do.

As I am only here for one year, and won't be graduating in the US, I haven't had to take any extra classes, so have only taken chemistry classes. If you are a full, 4-year student, you would have to take classes in a wide range of subjects. This means that the US are not as far ahead in terms of chemistry teaching at the same age as we are. I have only been taking senior-level or post-graduate-level classes while I've been over here, so I wonder if you entered as a Chemistry student, if you'd find it incredibly simple at first? For example, at my US university, they don't cover Physical Chemistry until the 3rd year, and the 1st year is just termed ""General Chemistry"".

Another thing that's different is that they have more constant work throughout the semester (homework, mid-term exams...) than we do, and it all counts towards the final grade for the class, generally. This is nice in some ways though - the content sticks in your head!

true,samir5,lfc68,,"I've read pretty frequently that Liverpool is going through a transition period. As true as that is, it shouldn't have affected the team as much as it has. 

Chelsea went through a massive overhaul and brought in a number of younger players. The difference is that Chelsea's new comers have made a significant impact and managed to get back their top four position. 

And even AC Milan who went through a transition period and were on the brink of the relegation zone in the beginning of the season managed to turn it around and are now on pace to finish 3rd in Serie A. 

While Liverpool, who I will admit have had considerable change (manager, new players, new owners) have gotten worse and not showed much improvement overall. The reason, I think, is that many of the signings made by Dalglish and BR were absolute RUBBISH or misused and in some cases very overpriced. Much of the signings have caused a stall in Liverpool's attempt at moving forward.

RTD had story arcs subtly threaded through each season. Each season had a different event leading the doctor and his companion to a 2part finale where little things we didnt even notice earlier on in the series were suddenly relevant and information that hadn't made sense did.
I feel this WILL happen with Moffat,  and I do think hes very clever. He's just dragging it out too much the whole ""silence will fall"" thing needs to END. I really hope the Clara mystery ends with it too and he doesnt try to drag that out for ages too.

Possible, but not certain. The big businesses who would benefit from protectionism have powerful lobbies on both sides.

&gt; Free movement of labour hasn't really benefitted many people in this country. You don't find 500,000 Brits working in Poland...

That's only because you don't understand then benefits of free movement of labour. As long as you are personally not the one out-competed by the immigrants and as long as they work - you benefit. Even more if they pay taxes.

Only it comes in small increments so you may not notice. Your nanny being more affordable than otherwise. Prices rising less quickly as the immigrants earn less. And so forth.

I would argue that UK has benefitted more from free movement of labour than Poland has. Poland has seen the most mobile portion of its labour force (so likely not the worst part) ending up benefiting the British economy, as opposed to the Polish one.

true,Jedibeeftrix,null,null,"that would be true if we didn't face immediate problems as a result of eurozone convergence as managed by the ECB.

the result; caucused positions that we have to implement due to QMV.

this is not a theoretical problem:

De jure incentives to take common position: This incentive is reinforced by the way the Commission’s ECB/EBA Regulations are currently drafted. For example:

• The ECB Regulation envisions the ECB acting as a coordinator of eurozone national supervisors, with the view for them to take a common position. The ECB has already dropped hints that it intends to actively discourage dissenting opinions amongst eurozone national supervisors.

• Through a eurozone caucus, some member states will indirectly boost their influence as their voting weight amongst eurozone countries is proportionally much greater than in the EU-27 (EU-28 with Croatia). This is particularly true of the larger eurozone member states.

• The safeguards proposed by the European Commission (see Section 5 below) leave the eurozone with the upper hand. Given that the 17 eurozone countries already constitute a simple majority, these countries would only need to seek the support of three ‘outs’ – whereas non-euro countries would need at least four countries.

De facto incentives to take a common euro position: To avoid banks free-riding on taxpayers in creditor countries, the ECB, Germany and others could well insist on putting into place perfectly harmonised eurozone regulations before moving to financial backstops. This could include single-target capital requirements, rules on leverage or bonuses – and could even spill over to market access issues. In turn, this would heavily shape decisions at the EBA, as the eurozone is unlikely to accept an uneven playing field within EU financial services as a whole.De facto incentives to take a common euro position: To avoid banks free-riding on taxpayers in creditor countries, the ECB, Germany and others could well insist on putting into place perfectly harmonised eurozone regulations before moving to financial backstops.

In turn, this would heavily shape decisions at the EBA, as the eurozone is unlikely to accept an uneven playing field within EU financial services as a whole.

Taken together, the EBA structure will therefore significantly shift the balance of power in favour of the eurozone, at the expense of the UK and other ‘outs’.

Most schools call them Peripatetic or Visiting Music Teachers and I don't think that you need QTS for that. If you go for an independent (private) school they are also more flexible about qualifications, although probably more demanding in expectation!  You will need to have a full CRB check however. 

Alternatively, you could offer to run a band session, music production club or Gospel Choir? These things are sometimes out of the comfort zone for trad music teachers but are exactly what the pupils want. They pay a fee to attend and you could work towards a gig at the end of the term or the year.  

I was also going to say that you could contact the ACM in Guildford and see if there are any jobs there but as you trained there I guess you might have already tried that! I have a friend who coached vocals there. 

Have a search on http://www.isc.co.uk/.  This is the independent schools' council and you can search for independent schools near Guildford.  You are in a good position as there are loads of independent schools in the area. Transport might be interesting though so make sure that you check out the location first! 

I hope that this helps &amp; good luck I am sure that the right job is out there!

Compare that to council tax where you're paying about £150 on the second lowest band (and I'm over that now) - it has DOUBLED in the past 3 years, actually in a 2 year period. Wages haven't rose anywhere close to that and inflation has fucked what money we have a little bit more. Seems like the ""financially responsible"" thing to do would be to not eat.

Weird how you know so much about my finances frankly.

If anything I've shown how financially responsible I can actually be by not crashing and burning in the past 4-5 months.

So to recap:

So the essay is pretty deeply flawed in its analysis.

OTOH, there is a grain of truth here: Since the reboot, the show seems to have made ""the Doctor flirts with his cute, young, female companion"" part of its formula. I think the show has worn that idea out pretty thoroughly and, after having the Doctor get married, the creepiness of it has grown exponentially.

(If you want to see how badly wrong this gone, simply revisit ""The Snowmen"": There's a really interesting potential in exploring the Doctor pushing everyone away from him, including his wife, and retiring in a cloud of bitterness and despair. There are a lot of interesting stories you could tell about that. Unfortunately, the story they actually chose -- ""all the Doctor really needs is a hot piece of young girl flesh and he'll follow his erection all the way back to social responsbility"" -- is not one of those stories.)

We do not do a good job in this country in this area, it is acceptable but it could be so much better but right here and now today there are real issues within health and social support. This sector has an unbelievable statutory requirement whist paying minimum wage in many roles if you cut this service then people will suffer more. 

Due to the nature of the work, unsociable hours and the low wage when compared to other roles requiring the same qualifications you do not get a lot of highly skilled applicants, I dislike the social culture of work that I see in many lines of work within the UK (how many times have you had to wait for someone to finish their conversation before you get served in a shop) within health and social support it is worse than average. Many time I have seen staff members chat whilst those that they are supporting are waiting for drinks, toilet breaks or just some attention. 
This sector need investment, the number of people requiring support are growing and we are already facing cuts. Rather soon people are going to realise that they have legal cases against providing authorities and that will bankrupt the service, even if cases are won or dismissed it will still bankrupt us.

We have some great people working in this sector but they are buried under paperwork that never gets read (unless you employ a person like myself).A person with good skills will get promoted so they no longer work hands-on and spend their days at a desk, which is a waste of talent. We need to recognise that people with outstanding hands on skills should be promoted in place. 

Yes we need low cost health and social support and that is achievable but when you have the hands on side of a service run by staff that have the lowest skills set you get poor results. 

I love my role and have gain a great deal of satisfaction from my role but I find it frustrating that I waste time on paperwork that is never read or completing training that does not support my core skills, I need to work with people that have highly developed communication skills more than those that have done a safe food handling course.

So Dad, who liked to learn the language from rented language tapes, was told the price was cinquemila (5,000 lira/ £2.50)... However dad miss heard the guy and thought he said cinquantamila (50,000 lira /£25)

At this point dad started raging in front of all the customers my brother and I had to put the ice cream back.  We were really confused.  Both of us had heard cinquemila and we had been listening to the same learn Italian tapes for the 24 hour drive to Venice so knew the basic language.

So we asked dad if £2.50 was too much for ice cream, as that's what the man had asked for.  Dad then realised his mistake and red faced bought them.

I am just hoping that he was serious when he spoke of one club that loved him, that he wants to live in London with his family, that he would prefer a challenge less similar to RM, and that he would prefer not to work with SAF in the hierarchy potentially (hopefully) undermining his status at the club.

""I can't help feeling that I bear some responsibility for what is happening in Wales. In my eagerness to undermine public confidence in the combined vaccine and create a market for my own patented single vaccine, I completely failed to consider how confused and worried parents would become, and how vaccination rates would fall; now people are dying as a result.

""I deeply regret my actions; and though I received a large sum of money for my research, which I now freely admit was conducted unethically and was in any case fabricated, that sum of around four hundred thousand feels tainted and worthless to me; I would much rather it be put to honest good use - perhaps to pay for the urgent administering of the combined MMR vaccine to the thousands of people in areas where there are now clusters of measles, or to compensate parents who paid ridiculously inflated prices to private clinics for single jabs which were completely unnecessary when the NHS already provides a more effective alternative for free.

""I would also ask people not to refer to me as 'Doctor' Wakefield in the United Kingdom. I broke the rules, I freely admit. I was dishonest and irresponsible, I brought the medical profession into disrepute. The British Medical Council made their judgement, and I no longer deserve that title.

It's usually cheaper to send to Euro bank accounts because of the European SEPA bank transfer system. British banks charge for these transfers too, but less.

mtgox.com has a Euro account with a bank in Poland which can be used for this, but mtgox only allows 'verified' accounts to transfer into that bank account. To be verified you need to scan and upload your passport and proof of address to mtgox. Sending to mtgox's Japanese account does not require verification.

bitstamp.net has a Euro account in Slovenia which you can use without uploading passport scans. Just sign up with your email address and then transfer from your online banking.. this is the simplest option available really.

There are also a number of small fx companies that will make it even cheaper to send money to euro bank accounts..

Unfortunately this.

We can't have it both ways. We can't have personal liberty without also having some people sink to the bottom and others rocket ahead; the more freedom you have, the less equality you end up with, but if ~~the state enforces~~ there is enforced equality (i.e. Communism) you have no freedom.

That doesn't mean that we abandon people to their own ineptitude, but I think that we do have to stop trying to use law as a way on enforcing morality and personal responsibility on people. The law should only really be there to protect people and their property from each other, *not* to protect people from themselves.

What I think can be done is to treat these things as failings of health and education. If people can't look after themselves, they haven't been educated properly. If people have a harmful addiction then it is healthcare, not prison, that will help them.

* It's a wonder you even know how to breathe.
* How insane are you, dude?

This is in response to me calling his opinions ""ill-considered"", basically. 

I have criticised the statements that /u/miloais has made, and said that he ""doesn't know what he's talking about"".

You know that was unnecessary, because you (or another mod) has deleted it. 

So how can I respond to that, if not by taking the piss about him ""crying"" over his downvotes? I didn't know that taking the piss out of ~~trolls~~ antagonists was against the rules here.

Ferguson has been a great rival of our club of course, and has done what he said by knocking us off our perch, however that was not solely his doing.  We have been going through decades of mismanagement, going back to the appointment of Souness.  He personally set us back about 10 years, done more damage to LFC than Ferguson has ever done.  Moores then seen fit to appoint Evans and his spice boys culture (he was too nice to be a manager) and then co-management with Houllier (co-management never works).  During all this time there were some shocking signings along with terrible transfer dealings done my Rick Parry who missed out on more crucial signings than I care to recall now.  Then after the appointment of the mighty Rafa, just when I think things are going to pick up, Moores sells to the American leeches who set us back many years yet again.  So no, I don't think Ferguson has had any direct affect over Liverpool FC, we done all the damage ourselves.
I have suffered for all my Liverpool supporting life having to put up with the manc supporters slagging and jibes, and it made me hate them with unbridled passion, I really do despise that club.  However, I personally think we need to get our own house in order before we can start slagging off United about losing a manager that completely transformed their club.  There'll always be that huge rivalry between us and the mancs, but our biggest rivals now are the clubs who are in direct competition for the league places and right now, as much as I hate to say it, that's the likes of Everton.  If anything comes from this I hope it is that Moyes goes to the mancs, it will destabilize our nearest league and city rivals.

Also, a lot of credit card companies/banks offer some assistance services for things like this, check your T&amp;Cs to see what extras are on your account, a lot of people are completely unaware of some of the perks available on many standard accounts!

As far as I know, you should be able to get it all back off the other guy's insurance, though companies can be rather slow to pay up.

I feel the problem with Clara is that she has been presented as a puzzle. And to keep the mystery, her character can't be fleshed out that much, so she's ended up with not much to do or say for herself. So you're right about how generic she sort of appears.

I don't think this would have been a problem if they had spent more time on her mystery in each episode - so that we got drawn in week by week, but they haven't paced it like that. Just a little moment here or there, with the big reveal presumably coming in the series finale.

None of this is a reflection on Jenna-Louise Coleman, who I think is doing very well with a limited role so far. Hopefully once Clara's puzzle is revealed, her character will be allowed to blossom.

true,Fermain,null,null,"I am a seller on Bitbargain, and yes, the prices *are* high. The reason for this is that UK banks have made it very difficult for companies to trade bitcoins on a big scale in the UK. To get bitcoins I use a company that does SEPA transfers to Bitstamp's Slovenian bank account, it takes 2-3 days and involves a £7 fee + currency conversion costs. I can then sell my bitcoins for a small arbitrage (My prices are rarely more than £5 above market rates) and this is my fee for doing the legwork.

Keep an eye on bitbargain, it varies depending on time of day, week or how market conditions are. During the boom I was able to sell at £30 over market rates because people were desperate to get in, during the price correction it was down to £3-4. As bitbargain becomes more popular, prices will come down as they have already. For me, bitbargain is the best place to start if you want an easy purchase.

You sign up, verify your phone (some sellers require bank verification - I do not), agree to buy a coin, transfer the money via bank transfer or pingit (I hate pingit, but I do take it), when the seller recieves payment the coins cash into your account and you can move them to a blockchain.info wallet or the wallet on your computer.

Buying a bitcoin from bitbargain for £80 when the market price is £72 seems annoying, but the prices can quite easily come up and down by £8 in a day and you might find that if you are waiting for money to cash into an exchange you will end up spending more than this (or less). You pay for the speed of bitbargain, so it's up to you.

If you want some more help with the SEPA transfer process, PM me and I will help you out. But if you are after a small amount, you might be better of paying for the arbitrage. Hope this helps.

   - In 2001, Archer's political career was abolished with a conviction for perjury.
 - We would welcome to this country victims of torture who are fleeing persecution and they won't even need to bring certificates of authentication from their torturers.
   - Labour famously relaxed the rules on immigration for asylum seekers for precisely this reason.
 - Wheel clamping is absurd and will be made illegal.
   - And was abolished in the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012. You can't (legally) be clamped by a private individual now - only by a government body such as the DVLA (for not paying your road tax) or your council (for not paying a parking fine).
 - All-night pub opening.
   - Labour greatly relaxed licensing laws so pubs could, should they wish, stay open much later.
 - ""British Libel laws are absolutely draconian""

true,mrdotwill,null,null,"I don't think we can judge a whole party on the comments of its biggest idiots but I do think that looking away from the leadership to its powerbase helps us analyse what is going inside a party.  Few people bother with party membership these days and those who do are worth looking at.  Which party do different people decide to join.

So if you want to know about the tories you have to listen not just to David Cameron but to Bob down the pub who is really concerned about his dying business and anti-social behaviour.  He isn't a smoothe propagandist and doesn't have policy makers he just chats to you and throws out ideas that represent some of the core ideas of the party which are not necessarily being represented in policy.  If you question him he doesn't know much about Europe but remembers the total bullshit story about them wanting to straighten bananas.  Bob doesn't speak for the Conservatives but he is a member and he has lots in common with other members and together they give an important insight into what Conservatives are about.  They aren't just about the bullingdon club doing favours for their posh friends they are about real everyday people who want to make the country better.  I am clearly a far leftie and have no love for right wing politics but looking at things like this makes me realise that my fight with them isn't good vs evil but human beings with good hearts and limited information trying to do good in different ways.

I realise I am going on a bit too much but will quickly mention Labour.  Look at the leadership and you get a bunch of career politicians who like the Tories will sell off public services and work for the bankers they will just do things in a way that hurt the poor a little less.  Talk to a local labour party member and you will learn about the other side of the party.  They tend to be very apologetic about Blair and his neo-con friends, ashamed of their parties involvement in the Iraq war and normal British working people who just want to be represented and taken care of by capitalism.  They want a public NHS and decent benefits to prop up poverty wages.  They are union types, they want more of a fair share of power in the system but they don't have a fundamental problem with state capitalism.

To get back on topic lets look at UKIP.  The leadership are still enjoying the main benefit of being a small party.  They promise they can improve services, cut taxes and do everything normal people want using made up figures.  The core concern is taking Britain further away from Europe getting rid of Europes regulations and saving government money.  So basically they want deregulation and small government like most of the right wing but they are willing to be more isolationist about it.  Mostly they are like the tories and want to undermine public services and regulations so that power moves from the state (that democratic thing where poor people still have votes) to the private sector (with its authoritarian power structures where poor peoples voices don't count).  So what about UKIPs power base, it's members, what do they think, what do they say what are their ideas?  Well they have support amongst the working class, people who see jobs go to educated and skilled immigrants instead of themselves.  You have a few crazies doing nazi salutes but for most UKIP fans it isn't about race it is about working class people from other countries being able to outcompete them which lowers wages.  They don't realise that business like immigrants.  To get skilled British workers you have to pay tax for a decent education system, much cheaper to import skills from other places.  UKIP also have support in the middle and upper classes which is why I worry about them much more than the BNP.  These UKIP members dislike Europe for the same reason they dislike big government.  Things like health and safety, human rights, benefits, aid, banking regulations etc. all benefit the poor at the expense of profits.  They don't want to think about what is best for workers or the continents economics or the long term health of the banking sector they care about their own interests which align with that of corporate power.  Deregulation and lower taxes for business at the expense of poor people who will be exploited by the rich without regulation and who rely far more on public services.  They are paranoid money hoarders terrified of any form of government power coming after any of their precious precious money.


So to sum up this long ramble that few people will read I think sharing things like this is important.  By looking into the uncensored thoughts of real political party members we can learn a lot more about the parties politics than simply listening to the official policies of leaders.

I have no idea what is happening to this show.  One problem is that they really muted any overarching arc that was building to this point.  In 2 episodes, he's going to be at Trenzalore, but we haven't seen the silence all season.  We still don't really know what they are about - and who else is part of this ""religious order"" since it's not (apparently) just the guys in the plastic suits with the freaky heads.  I guess, because the doctor ""died"" and he erased himself from the universe, the silence consider him a closed issue - but you'd think they would start figuring out that he is still alive by now. Still, they could be showing a lot more of what is going on with them.  Instead, they just start a new mystery w/ Clara...without solving many old ones.

I still feel annoyed that a lot of things were unanswered from like 2 years ago.  It's still not clear why the silence blew up the TARDIS (or how it even blew up to the extent where the universe was destroyed since many TARDISs were destroyed in the time war w/o those consequences).  So many things don't make sense to me - why lock him in the pandorica if he's the one who is supposed to blow up the TARDIS and destroy the universe...yet...the silence blow up the TARDIS anyway...which destroyed the universe?  Is that what happened or did I just misunderstand the show?

Also, the whole process to kill the doctor was so bizarre...why would you need to breed a psychopath half-time-lord to do it?  They had about 1000 opportunities to kill him in other situations that required far less planning. Building a space suit was just beyond weird...and there was no reason River even had to be inside of it since it moved without her control.

true,ninereeds314,null,null,"The US culture of suing has already been mentioned. Possibly somewhat related to the UK lack of that (to the same degree, at least so far) - the UK culture of bad service and not providing the service you paid for. To some degree I think this is *why* at least some of us are so hostile to the idea of a culture of suing - some of us would be faced with the prospect of being forced to do the job we were paid for, which is just horrifying! What next - being *polite*! Service with a *smile*!

The more likely that you can't get back to harass them and that it will be just cheaper and easier to pay again to have someone else do it or do it yourself, the less likely it is that the job you've paid for will be done.

It's not really as bad as I make it sound - actually miserable demotivated service *is* good service in Britain, as British customers hate to see the people providing their services happier and more motivated and efficient than they are. Providing someone to sneer at and look down on is just part of the service.

But sometimes you do get *pure* bad service too. And it tends to do well - for some Brits, getting bad service and sneering at it is a kind of extreme sport.

Anyway, if the hire company aren't providing a part of the service you paid for, there's the possibility of suing them for that, including the costs you've incurred as a result.

If you convince them that you're willing to do that, and that you're not just going to go away, you might see some better service. But if they believe the threat is just a bluff, perhaps not.

You probably want to find legal advice in America, though. A British solicitor may assume you don't really want to resolve the situation, you just want to sneer at two bad service providers at once.

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"&gt; Even if it was proven to make a serious difference to smoking rates, what business is it of the government's or anyone else's whether a person smokes?

Hence not making it illegal outright, however smoking causes social and health problems of which the state is tasked with cleaning up, I don't think they should stop cleaning up the problems; smokers should get treatment on the NHS regardless of how ""self inflicted"" the disease is. At the same time, then, perhaps the state can save resources by investigating possible ways to get people away from the things they are forced to clean up. 

For example, raising the age of smoking from 16 to 18 has lowered the rate at which minors take up smoking.  Or should we work under the assumption that this is a free country children are free to do whatever they like and let them buy cigarettes when they're 12? This is how it was when my old man was growing up and it gave him a habit that he had until he was 45.

That is true, but not very many, out of [over 60](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_prisoners_with_whole-life_tariffs) that have been passed.

Overwhelmingly they fall into three groups: Serial/spree killers, those with extremely violent prior offences, and those who have murdered for financial gain. The few exceptions to this tend to be very violent, sexually motivated crimes, mixed with severe mental health issues (and these tend to be served at secure hospitals)

In this case the prosecution seems to have conceded she did not specially intend to murder, but rather had ""no regard whatsoever for the consequences"" while committing a violent act

To be clear I am not saying I think a whole life tariff would necessarily be unreasonable, but that the vast majority of whole life tariffs have been for rather different crimes.

Edit: You can have a look at the [sentencing guidelines](http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/murder/) and come to your own judgement.

I'm pretty sure that's what the field of psychology would call them. 

I think it's child abuse, for example, to persistently belittle your kid by calling them ""useless"" or ""worthless"". I think it's abusive to tell a gay kid that homosexuality is sinful and that there's something wrong with them for being who they are.

I don't know that I can have a discussion with you if you dispute this.

It seems like you're saying that the whole field of psychology is invalid.

You seem to be saying that the ""offended individual"", anyone who's been bullied or suffered ongoing harassment, can just *turn off* the effect of psychological attacks or something by ""deciding"" not to ""take offence"" to them - that's not the experience of medical professionals who work with people who have been bullied or psychologically abused.

As for the second point, you may be right, but I'm not sure it accounts for the whole discrepancy. As evidence for this I would point to the continued prominence of the gender gap at specialized institutes, where males still lead females in STEM and non-stem specializations (though obviously these specialized institutes do hold a range of subjects still). Examples:
London School of Hygiene and tropical Medicine, Institute of Education, School of oriental and African Studies, Imperial College London. 

N.B. As interesting note and potential point of evidence for your case many of the specialized institutions in music, art, drama, performance and agriculture did not list average figures for professors and so were ignored in my original count, however they quite frequently do pay more  to female non-professors than male non-professors! Which suggests that the wage divide works either way with females being favored in wages for these more traditionally ""feminine""  subjects, and men being favored in wage terms for traditionally ""masculine"" subjects.

&gt; After Scrapbook exposed sick comments from a UKIP councillor on banning unemployed people from voting, the party’s most high-profile new recruit has rushed to his defence, claiming Cllr Tom Bursnall **“has a point”**, going on to say **it is “dangerous” to let unemployed people vote**.

If you read the twitter conversation that is linked to by the political scrapbook you'll see she didn't say it is dangerous to let unemployed vote. She said it was dangerous to let those who didn't contribute vote. You notice they only quoted the juicy part and not the bits that showed she was actually responding to a question and that there quite possibly could be some context we're missing. 

Now she didn't exactly say what exactly she meant by people who don't contribute the, but she did say [""I didn't say I agreed, I said he made a fair point by raising issue""](https://twitter.com/AlexandralSwann/status/192330573711278080) in reference to how she rushed to Bursnall's defence.

Now I don't agree with her no matter if those who don't contribute number 100 or 100,000. But the article is clearly trying to suggest she meant all unemployed people which I think any reasonable person can see is really twisting her words.

Woah, horsey!  I was getting into the semantics of what constitutes ""harm"", and although I tried to be careful in phrasing it, I clearly wasn't careful enough.

&gt; I don't know what you want to call them, if you don't consider harassment and bullying to be ""harmful"".

I was really thinking in terms of adults in my last post, rather than children.  But even in the latter case, or in the case of particularly sensitive adults, the advice always goes: disregard the bully, sticks and stones.  We are taught - or should be - to realise our own power over our reactions to words, so we don't slap every person who calls us a name.  By the time that you are an adult, except in very extreme circumstances, I would suggest that *yes*, you ought to be able to self-manage and mitigate the effects of most types of verbal harassment.

&gt; I think it's child abuse, for example, to persistently belittle your kid by calling them ""useless"" or ""worthless"".

This is one such extreme example, where somebody is taunted by words with no learned way of countering them, in the place that is meant to be their sanctuary, by their primary role models, in a time of psychological development.  That's harmful - I'll concede. 

In another example... say, you are surrounded by bullies, in positions of power, showering you with negativity, for example, in a workplace or school environment.  Those words *could* have negative consequences.  But yes, I *do* believe you have to make a *decision* not to turn your upset into a killing spree for instance.  You either remove yourself from those people, negotiate with them, better them, or ignore them completely.

I just thought the whole thing was interesting that even in academia, usually a fairly liberal space, gender wage gaps were very clear, despite the fact that most of the accepted differences between sexs (rather than genders) have no bearing on the ability to be an academic. In essence its interesting because one of three things are possible: 

1- Sample base to small, statistical issues, etc.

2- Academia is not even close to the gender equality it preaches or proclaims to have.

3- Academia acknowledges via wage evidence that one gender is generally better at the production of knowledge than the other, in different specific fields.

Let me clarify the statement I made in my last comment: ""if an adult is boasting of shagging 13 year olds today, then he should be investigated"".

I think that's obvious. 

John Peel isn't going around shagging 13 year olds today, because he's dead.

Now I'm not one of these people who says ""you can't say this about Jimmy Savile because he hasn't been found guilty in a court of law"".

I absolutely believe that these historic crimes should be recognised.

I guess I'm not sure that these allegations rise to that level - not on the basis of some statement allegedly made to a journalist 20+ years ago and especially not if prosecuted by Julie Burchill, known transphobe.

""Fascist: An authoritarian and nationalistic right-wing system of government and social organization.""

If anybody wants to argue that UKIP aren't nationalistic or right wing I will expand this answer.  I am guessing that you accept that they are those those things but would disagree with the idea that they have the authoritarian inclination required to be comparable to fascists.  They are in favour of small government so surely aren't authoritarian.  Well no, let's whip out another definition.

""Authoritarian: Favoring or enforcing strict obedience to authority at the expense of personal freedom.""

People often think of authoritarian being inseparable from the state but the definition doesn't mention the state it mentions authority.  Authority means those with power so we we need to look at who has power.  Well corporations and the super wealthy have or control the majority of economic power.  They have far more money than the state and far more flexibility on where they direct it.  They also have a huge amount of control over the media.  Owners and advertisers excerpt far more control over media than the government could.  I could go into detail or keep listing things but I think the point is made and I am trying to be brief honestly.

But the government write the laws and control the military and regulate the economy and pretty much everything else so aren't they more powerful?  Well yes they have a lot of power but who control the government?  Well to a worrying extent those corporate interests do.  The government listen far more to the richest 5% of the population than the bottom 50%.  Think tanks, lobbyists, the media, consultants and whatnot aren't in Westminster urging politicians to focus on workers wages and public services they are there to align government policy with the corporate interest which is profit for bosses, more money to the rich.

But we are still a democratic society, non-millionaires still have the vote.  The rich have some influence over the way we do through the media but pesky voters still want taxes on wealth to fund hospitals and schools and other things we need.  This is hinders corporate power somewhat and is an annoyance but we would have a revolution the second they took away democracy so they can't just overthrow the government.  What they can do is take their time and play politics and shrink it over time.  Slowly privatise the NHS, cut benefits, cut regulation, lower taxes and make sure the government (the only democratically elected people with power) are small ineffective and on their side.

UKIP as a far right party push this even more than the others towards small ineffectual government which works for the benefit of the rich.  They push to concentrate power and authority in the hands of the few and make people more subservient to it.  That is authoritarian.

If you have authoritarianism hiding behind nationalism a comparison to fascism is perfectly valid.

UKIP are sometimes described as libertarian like the tea party in America but it doesn't make sense to me.  To be a libertarian you need to want liberty.  Liberty doesn't mean freedom from the state it just means freedom and you can't have freedom without equality.  You can call concentrating power in the hands of the few whatever you want but I like the old world fascism.  It helps people remember that it is the enemy of freedom and equality, that it is not in their best interest and that they should not vote for it.",0,1368026657,null,0,false,0,c9utoa0,t3_1dwre8,t1_c9utoa0,t1_c9uoxqn,null,1431261647,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

""I'm hoping for a 2.2 at best.""

How conceited can you get?

Seriously, if you were even close to being ""brilliant"" you wouldn't be getting a 2.2 from a university that let you in with BBCC, regardless of how much effort you put in at A-Levels. You can develop an academic work ethic whenever you want, it doesn't have to be at school, and clearly university is ""expecting more"" of you because you're not doing very well at all. Even without a particularly good work ethic, getting a 2.1 from a non-russell group uni (which I assume you're in because BBCC isn't exactly great for RG maths) should be plain sailing for someone with innate genius like you (lol). At A-level, some of the people at my school got 90-100% in all their maths modules without doing a great deal of work - shockingly because they were reasonably close to ""brilliance"" and maths is one subject where brilliance can trump work ethic every time. 

It sounds like a couple of teachers at a pretty average school told you that you were reasonably smart and you decided that it meant you were some sort of undiscovered genius, bottled your a-levels because you didn't work hard enough because it was all ""beneath"" you, and now you've bottled your degree because you couldn't be arsed when you realized you were going to have to actually do some work. Sound about right? Maybe you shouldn't have listened to the idiots who said you were super smart? (Tip: When extremely bright people call you smart, you're smart. When Dave at the chippy calls you smart, it's meaningless)

Stop looking for excuses by blaming the school system. There's plenty of ways of challenging yourself when you're younger. You're not some undiscovered genius and you're not some special snowflake that needs ""nurturing"". There are thousands of people like you in this country at your age, just as smart (and smarter) and with much better grades. There are also thousands of people who work damn hard to get their grades, perhaps because they aren't hindered by genius like you, and it's pathetic that you think you're somehow better than them because of some perceived ""brilliance"" that you've conjured in your brain, leading you to think that you should be ""separated"" from people who work extremely hard to get the best grades they can, which might not be outstanding, but I know who I'd rather hire to work for me.",0,1368027482,null,0,1368028359,0,c9utysy,t3_1dtrof,t1_c9utysy,t1_c9ufjof,null,1431261510,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

&gt;This bill is designed to make it easier to deport people who do not have the right to stay in the UK, and to prevent immigrants accessing services to which they are not entitled. Businesses that use illegal labour will face increased fines, and private landlords will be required to check the immigration status of their tenants.

After seeing UK Border Force, the Sky documentary, I became very aware of just how little the police can currently do to try and deport people, especially without passports. It also made me wake up to the issue of employers employing illegal immigrants. So I'm happy to see this, however this doesn't sound so good:

&gt;The right of appeal against immigration decisions will be restricted, and immigration officers will be given more powers.

""Restricted""? I'm more than a little worried about what that could mean.

&gt;Forced marriage will become a criminal offence, as will a breach of a forced-marriage protection order.

I'm wondering now why it *isn't* a criminal offence. It should have been already.

The pensions stuff sounds good. We're spending tons on pensions, and as much as I think they're a good idea, we do need to tackle the cost urgently.

&gt;The bill will introduce criminal penalties for breaching UK protected designs, and bring in measures to speed up the patent-application process.

This sounds bad. Criminal penalties for violating protected designs is a terrible idea. Intellectual property violation should only ever be a civil offence. Speeding up application probably means less quality control. I can't see that being a good thing.

&gt;This bill will mean that gambling operators based overseas will be required to hold a license from the UK Gambling Commission.

That sounds like a good thing. If people are selling gambling services to people in the UK, the laws should apply to them.

&gt;makes us a part of an EU-wide civic education program called Europe for Citizens

A lot of people don't know much about the EU, maybe this could change that. I hope it does, since the Tories want to hold that EU referendum.

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; or a religious minority?

It is not meaningful to describe Christians as a persecuted minority in the United Kingdom. 

I hope this saves you some time.

The groups I am referring to when I use the word ""marginalised"" include, but are not limited to: GSMs (not sure the best way to express that longhand, sorry), people of colour, members of other ethnic minorities, the homeless, the disabled and mentally handicapped, those with mental illness.

&gt; it would be ok to offend a large group, but not a small group?

It is OK to ""offend"" anyone.

It is not OK to use insulting words which specifically refer to the attributes of people who are marginalised in society. I.E. ""nigger"", ""faggot"" &amp;c.

That is what I mean by ""harmful"" - these words are divisive, and they cause further marginalisation of those who they affect and refer to.

It is not ok to harass people, to be persistently and verbally abusive to people. 

&gt;are you advocating making 'causing offense' illegal in certain circumstances?

I'm pretty sure that it's already illegal to use slurs like the word ""nigger"" in public. If it's not, then, yes, I'm happy for it to be so. 

I certainly believe that crimes of harassment or bullying can and should be considered ""aggravated"" if they're both *against* marginalised people and *because* of the attributes which causes the victim to be marginalised.

It is not ok, for example to indoctrinate your child that ""homosexuality is a sin"" or that ""black people are racially inferior"". I would consider that to be child abuse, if you're persistent in impressing these ideas on your child; I consider that be harmful and that it should be illegal.

I will refer you to [last week's thread on the subject of slurs](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1dlzy2/use_of_the_word_faggot_by_north_american_reddit/). It might be worth you familiarising yourself with that, if you're not already.

[This comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1dxb06/while_on_holiday_in_cornwall_a_gentleman_had_a/c9uqvcf) is still here, explaining at least one comment that I didn't read before it was deleted but which appears to have assumed that OP was acting out the US culture of suing in an unreasonable way.

My comment (hopefully obviously) is mostly a joke, but it *is* true that sometimes you have to push service providers hard (including threatening legal action) before they will provide the full service that you have paid for. And I do wonder a bit why us Brits are so keen on complaining about bad service, but so rarely take those complaints back to the service provider.

I'd suggest you take what you're offered and apply to transfer when you arrive. 

There are never enough rooms to go around and the majority don't get their first or even second choice. If you turn down the offer they won't make you another one. You won't be able to go above the accommodation services and even if you can you don't want to. I saw several pushy parents email or phone senior staff only to have said staff tell us nope the students wasn't getting another offer. 

The only exceptions are on health grounds and only if medical evidence can be provided and in such cases you still won't get a choice you'll just be put wherever best suits your needs. 

If you don't want to take the offer start looking for private accommodation though I wouldn't recommend that as you'll miss out on a unique experience. 

We got hundreds of phone calls and emails everyday and if you've made a mistake that is your problem, the university is under no obligation to provide you with accommodation. If you're worried about finding private accommodation the university should have an approved list of landlords who won't rip you off. 

I dealt with many students who made a mistake or didn't get what they want. Truth is you need to buckle up and take responsibility for your mistakes. 

Is it the cost that bothers you ? Or something else?

Back to the Silence... While it's true they wanted to deal with the Doctor, I really doubt they had anything to do with the TARDIS blowing up.

Sure some people have a genetic disadvantage towards being an addict, just as there are recognisable genetic markers towards most physical and mental illnesses. 

To the best of the available scientific knowledge, it does seem that everything is pre-determined only the Abrahamic religions try and say that man is different from animals due to having his 'free will'.

You might not like it, but wouldn't you rather live in a world where people could be cured of their addicted afflictions, rather than just *choosing* a life of fags booze and poundland pizza?

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"&gt; It is not meaningful to describe Christians as a persecuted minority in the United Kingdom.

woah nellie - who said anything about Christians? is it only ethnicities and certain sexual persuasions that can be victimised in this way? 

&gt; The groups I am referring to when I use the word ""marginalised"" include

so religious groups cannot be marginalised? 

&gt; It is not OK to use insulting words which specifically refer to the attributes of people who are marginalised in society. I.E. ""nigger"", ""faggot"" &amp;c.

does this apply only when you're directing them at a member of this group, or to anyone? eg. If I called my mum a 'faggot' - is that ok or not? 

&gt; That is what I mean by ""harmful"" - these words are divisive, and they cause further marginalisation of those who they affect and refer to.

what about if I referred to those of the muslim faith as ""pedophile worshippers""? or to christians as ""sky fairy lovers""? 

&gt; It is not ok to harass people, to be persistently and verbally abusive to people.

I agree. 

&gt; I certainly believe that crimes of harassment or bullying can and should be considered ""aggravated"" if they're both against marginalised people and because of the attributes which causes the victim to be marginalised.

so...against a group of a certain faith...because of the attributes of that faith? or don't you believe muslims are marginalised? 

&gt; I would consider that to be child abuse, if you're persistent in impressing these ideas on your child; I consider that be harmful and that it should be illegal.

So if I express to my child my belief that homosexuality is sin, you would want that child taken away from me? 

&gt; If you've ever had the shit kicked out of you for being Christian, and you can establish that this is a common occurrence, then I'll be happy to consider that a ""hate crime"".

1st minute and Hazard scores. Rapes us with an easy 1-2 through the pitch and puts a goal past Lloris.

Chelsea then become complacent (realising we don't get good until the 80th minute) and pass the ball around, never making any serious efforts. Roman has a shit-eating grin whilst looking at Levy, sipping on a cup of oil as he mocks us. 

Half-Time. 1-0 Chelsea. AVB gives a teamtalk that gets the team excited, but not enough to win a match. Sherwood attempts a teamtalk but the same reaction is given. But then Freund stands up, and gives a speech so beautiful that Sandro is spotted crying (6th sense and what-not). Holtby stands up and gives a valiant cheer, as does Parker - but then there is a roar. The stadium shakes with the sheer force of this shout and several players collapse in fear of it, and Huddlestone is spotted smashing footballs through the stadium in anger at how he's let the club down by not scoring a screamer yet.

The game starts again and Spurs start with unbelievable skill. Disco Benny flicks the ball over Mata, before tapping the ball to Huddlestone who smashes the ball 82 yards - straight into the back of the net. 1-1.

Chelsea realise that a draw can still put them through to the Champions League and get cheeky. Playing the ball around the back 4 so that we can't get the ball (despite our best efforts). Huddlestone glances over to AVB and he immediately knows what has to be done. Holtby, Parker, Vertonghen and Lloris launch an attack on Chelsea, causing them to slip-up and kick the ball out. Freund is substituted for Adebayor. 

Chelsea attempt to recoup the ball, but Huddlestone refuses to let them, charging through 7 players and a Cat to get to the 18 yard box. He then chips the ball up and sends it high into the back of the area. Freund suddenly performs a miraculous scorpion kick sending the ball over Cech and into the goal. 

Abramovich falls to his knees (spilling oil everywhere) and Levy merely laughs. A banner slowly rises from the crowd, simply stating ""Don't fuck with Levy"". Tottenham rise to 3rd, and thanks to the events seen [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/1d323v/really_want_him_to_score_would_be_an_amazing/c9mg25f) - gets into the Champions League.

“This is a great trap of the twentieth century: on one side is the logic of the market, where we like to imagine we all start out as individuals who don't owe each other anything. On the other is the logic of the state, where we all begin with a debt we can never truly pay. We are constantly told that they are opposites, and that between them they contain the only real human possibilities. But it's a false dichotomy. States created markets. Markets require states. Neither could continue without the other, at least, in anything like the forms we would rec­ognize today.”

It seems that if someone crashes into your car you can very easily claim to have suffered injuries, and our legal and insurance system can't properly cope with these claims.

The end result is that the cost of car insurance is rocketing up for everybody in Britian, and there's a feeling that something should be done to try to mitigate the effects of what we consider to be an American claims culture.

Insurance isn't there for people to claim as much as they can. The attitude used to be perhaps be more in favour of that, but there's now a perception that we're all suffering because people are doing that.

The British attitude is one of fairness, and as a culture over the next few years we'll need to get to grips and decide if we start being far more harsh with claims, or if we just accept that if you scratch someone's bumper they'll claim for whiplash every time.

Your original post reads a little bit off. You were in a collision but you were forced to stay in B&amp;Bs and you want your money back? 

Yes, that is covered by insurance, but some people may read that as a little bit frivolous.

true,Awittysaying,null,null,"It's more to do with allocating everyone who has applied. Basically those with medical issues are allocate rooms first then it is done based on halls site so if you put your first option as one of the less popular sites you are more likely to get what you want.

 Allocating rooms is often still being done up until early to mid September. It's a logistics issue if you started to let people reapply because they didn't get the room they wanted you'd never have enough time to allocate everyone. 

Flats are typically offered to mature students, postgrads, families, or those with medical issues. Are you an undergrad ? 

If it is a self contained flat you've been offered ? 

You won't have any idea how many rooms are left as that won't be known to more than a few staff.  The allocation process can be really complicated as each halls site has its own site manager who allocates rooms. And a students application can end up going from one site to another depending on a number f factors. Things such as catered or self catered, and same sex or mixed flats can really chance how your application is dealt with. The best way to apply is to be as open as possible and go for self catered. 

I also just realised it is really early for accommodation offers to be going out. Typically this time of year the only offers being made are to current students needing to stay in halls or international students arriving in July for English courses. 

You should look up the accommodation application deadlines because it might be possible to reject your offer and put in a new request before the deadline hits. If you do that you should still stand as much chance as any other student. 

Of course that all depends on your university I can only really speak for how Southampton run their accommodation.

true,Galerath,null,null,"Well it's enforced equality in the sense that property rights are denied in order to prevent the accumulation of capital. As I recall Marx wanted to remove the Landlords and Manufacturers, but this also requires removing the idea of property rights and individual ownership of lands or capital. This is because Smith showed that accumulation of capital inevitably leads to wealth disparity which inevitably creates hierarchy and separate classes of people (wherein, according to Smith himself, the interests of the Manufacturers is often directly opposed to the interests of the laboring poor).

However, my position is that if you're living in a commune where you have no possessions and no individual property, it is essentially enforced equality. It's socially enforced rather than legally enforced, but it's still enforced -  ""From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs"" means by its nature that whatever I create is not mine, and if I am not allowed to own what I have created, then that is, in my eyes, enforced equality. It doesn't matter how much I create, I will never own more than anyone else. It doesn't matter how hard I work, I will always receive the same proportion of the whole. 

I'm sure a Communist/Anarchist will want to say that this is the true state of nature of humanity, therefore there is no coercion or force involved, and the desire for ownership is a false one that is part of the capitalist framework, or somesuch, so that's going to be a point of contention I'm sure. But I'm just explaining my meaning.

It's not quite so simple as this, for instance, very few people think that it should be legal to sign yourself into indentured labour or slavery. It's about a balance between the two- you use the law to restrict things which are abusive and/or very addictive, and as you say, simultaneously use the health, education and planning systems to allow and encourage people to live healthy, happy, decent lives. 

A reasonable drug policy would not mean complete legalization and deregulation of all drugs. You wouldn't allow people to sell heroin on the streets or in Tescos, but have health service clinics where people could inject the most addictive drugs, and then less addictive drugs would be available but taxed, and heavily regulated.

Firstly: I'm not going to engage with transphobes.

It's not a matter of ad-hom or not. I just think transphobes are disgusting people, and I'm not going to associate with them. You've had every opportunity to clarify your position on transphobia, and the closest you've come is ""what's that got to do with anything?""

I don't care whether or not you think you've won this argument. 
I have better things to do. I'm not going to waste my time with transphobes. I'll leave other people to form their own opinion of what you say.

My Uncle is extremely well in at United, he's had a private box for many, many years, Sir Alex is one of his closest friends and he even flies with the team on certain European away games. He splits his time between London and Manchester so we take each other to games, it's not terribly far for me to get to Manchester.

We don't go to every game, so we also use the seats to reward employees for performance or anniversaries.

What I'm against is throwing people in prison for drug use and outright prohibition on pleasurable but potentially harmful things on the basis that we have to protect people from themselves.

Partners get paid out of the profits of their practice. Most practices rely on QOF for a large part of their income.
http://www.qof.ic.nhs.uk/

The upshot is: if you run a big practice which ticks all the government's boxes, and you do it efficiently, you can make a lot of money. Most GPs don't make a lot of money, either because they put what they think is best for their patients above box-ticking, or because they have a difficult patient population which is hard to tick all the boxes on.

Also, when you say ""did exceptionally well"", what you really mean is ""went from a totally untenable situation where nobody wanted to go into GP practice to a vaguely attractive one where you could actually recruit new people into the profession"".",0,1368035121,null,0,false,0,c9uwo7j,t3_1dxuc0,t1_c9uwo7j,t1_c9uwayr,null,1431260234,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

It is a real tough one. The last thing we want is to get into a situation where we are hiring and firing like the rest of the league- so I think that long term stability and the potential to grow long term is what we need to be looking for. 

As Everton fan's, if he does go then we need to be willing to ride the storm for the next few seasons. The players are so built into Moyes's system that any transition will be difficult, but as long as growth is showing, we need to remain patient. 

As a bit of a curveball in some respects I would not be unhappy to see Steve Round take the manager job with Phil Neville as his assistant... Two guys who embody the spirit of Moyes and have crazy respect from the players. With the entire backroom staff speaking amazingly highly of Round and his ability as an assistant, I feel he could transition smoothly in the way that Steve Clarke did at WBA.

In honestly... I would be happy with most reasonable replacements other than Martinez. For me, the guy is a form before function manager who is tactically flawed and astonishingly overrated. The main defence of him is that he 'started the Swansea revival', well- form before function works in the lower leagues, not so much against top teams as has been proven by his consistently poor performances at Wigan (which, granted has been on a shoestring budget).

In terms of managers from the outside, I really like Pochettino- he did great at Espanyol and has done a terrific job at Southampton under tough circumstances. Rangnick is also a fantastic manager, and very much the style of leader that Everton need- I don't think he will be ready to take on another top job, which is a shame. 

Aside from them, there are a few Championship managers who are talented. Poyet or Mackay would be welcomed. ",0,1368035523,null,0,false,0,c9uwtky,t3_1dx7br,t1_c9uwtky,t3_1dx7br,null,1431260164,2,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,2

Late in the first half, Mata squeaks in a clean finish that narrowly escapes Lloris. 

Second Half Bale looks more focused than David Luiz at an actors guild meeting. He nets two early on and the Yids are going mental.... Late in the 80th, Siggy puts in the goal of the year with a dipping screamer that temporarily causes Cech to go full retard and can't even get close to the Ball...

Season 6 started off fantastic and then completely fell off the wagon at Let's Kill Hitler. River turned into a Doctor fangirl who based her life and choices completely off of a guy as well as took jail time for him. Ugh. The idea in the finale of the Doctor keeping things on the downlow was a great idea but has been poorly handled and hasn't really happened in Season 7.
Season 7 has been a mess filled with gaping plot holes and deus ex machina endings. We are two episodes from the finale and have gotten absolutely zero clues about Clara, we've only been reminded that we're supposed to care about her. Not the way to keep people caring about a mystery.

I could ignore all of these however if I hadn't been so bothered with the sexism that's really taken a turn for the worse on this show. For example, in ""Angels Take Manhattan"" how is it okay for the Doctor to yell at River to 'get out of the angel's grasp' without breaking her wrist and have her pretend to do it in order to make him happy? That's just manipulative and abusive. Especially after that whole deal when River tells Amy to 'not let him see the damage?' 
And could you really see RTD's 9 or 10 dumbing down the TARDIS because the companion is a girl? (Thank you Journey to the Center of the TARDIS for that slap in the face)

Also depending on which career path you choose, a portfolio of work or examples that you *can deliver* will be crucial.

First year, he's going to work with what he's got, probably make a few small signings for the future, maybe one big grab so that the media can go off their tits about ""Moyes' new vision."" With Giggs staying on, with Moyes and Rooney being who they are, and with van Persie's form, there's no need for any big change on the pitch yet.

As for Fellaini, I don't know, maybe he'll get sold off, but I think whoever the new manager is (and I'm not sold on Martinez) will try and keep him. The new manager is probably going to worry more about that mess up front with Anichebe and Jelavic, maybe sell Jelavic or find someway to make him useful rather than giving him the Torres treatment like Moyes did.

Forster - signed to Celtic in 2012, been playing extremely well for them, and gets a ton of games for them. Would most likely want to be guaranteed some kind of minimum appearances number while he works on adapting to BR's style.

Courtois- very good, but at 20 and with no proper EPL experience on top of the fact he's actually said he wants to be Chelsea's next keeper after a few more years, not realistic in my eyes.

Oliver Baumann - also a bit too young at 22, no EPL experience, and Freiburg isn't exactly the best place to pump out top quality GKs.

Butland - just signed up for Stoke, he's going nowhere.

Basically, anyone up thinks Reina leaving is OK is wrong, in my opinion.

That FTR is why they still card you ( ask for ID )  when you're in your 30's, because it's hard to tell.  

I know it's not an excuse for Peel in retrospect, but when you read his biography he was a young bloke in his early 20's going from ( in his own own mind ) an ugly youth rejected by British girls to the US where stunning  females ( and they are... stunning ) were throwing themselves at him left right and centre at the stage door. He even says he found out at a much later date that the 13 year old who gave him regular blowjobs was actually way younger than she'd led him to believe.


I've been on tour in the US, I've seen how it goes down, especially when you get out to places like California.  I had one girl all over me after a gig in Venice Beach. I thought was the same age because she told me she was studying at Berkley ( I was 25 at the time ) then her dad arrived at the gig to pick her up. It was a good job too because I later found out from her friend that she was bloody 14. 

I can imagine it was worse in the 60's too, hippies, summer of love, beatniks and all that.

So up top in the pyramids River gives the Doctor this whole explanation of what she's done because she loves him, right? She's been looking for help and she loves him and will suffer if he dies, etc...

He knows he has the key to save himself already. River is just stalling basically and reality is slowly falling apart. 

Instead of taking her aside and simply saying ""look into my eye"" he instead marries her despite showing no interest in doing so up to this point in the series. They're relationship isn't developed enough at this point for them to get married. (Reason 1 why I didn't like this) 

So why does he marry her? Because he thinks she's too emotional at this point. Or he feels bad because he knows she's going to go to prison at this point and be blamed for something she had no control over. (Reason 2 why I didn't like this. The Doctor is in control of River's life and decision making at this point) 

Which is why I say he married her to shut her up. Because River is really getting the crap end of the stick here. But she can't say he doesn't love her because hey, he married her, didn't he?

Once you've bought something, you have to watch it for the first time within 30 days, or it expires.  Once you've watched it for the first time, you can watch it as many times as you want for 48 hours, and then it expires.  It's pretty much like the old fashioned video shop in that sense.

Prices vary from 99p to £3.99, depending on how new the film is.  They have a weekly promotion called Movie Mondays where they have a collection of twelve films for 99p if you pop in the code when you buy (the code is displayed in big letters at the top of the [Movie Mondays page](http://www.blinkbox.com/moviemondays), you don't need to have bought something at full price or anything like that to get it).  There's usually one, maybe two good ones, and two or three you've never heard of.  The rest fall somewhere in the middle.  The same rules apply; you've got 30 days to watch it the first time, and 48 hours as many times as you want after that.

They compare very well with LoveFilm's pay per view.  I was finding all the films I wanted to see were taking way too long to become ""free"" on LoveFilm; if I was going to pay for the film anyway, I didn't want to pay the subscription too.

It's owned by Tesco so you can collect Clubcard points too, but I'm not sure at what rate.

Right, I hope some of these interest you/you haven't seen before, a few of them I recommended on a TV recommendation thread a few weeks back, but oh well! 

[Trailer Park Boys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_Park_Boys) - Comedy/mockumentary following a group of trailer park residents, and their shenanigans, it's a really good laugh.

[Eastbound &amp; Down](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastbound_%26_Down) - A comedy that follows a retired baseball star that needs money, so he becomes a substitute teacher. Another funny series, although it's American, it follows the English 6 episodes in a season making it not such a massive effort to watch and get through.

[Archer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archer_%28TV_series%29) - It's an animated American comedy series, (adult, not kids), really fast paced humour, and great fun to watch. Every episode never fails to make me laugh, for me it's on par with the likes of Simpsons and Family Guy. Never seen it on TV over here though.

[Friday Night Lights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_Night_Lights_%28TV_series%29) - American sports drama, about a high school (American) football team in a small town in Texas, and all the events that happen in that town. Even if you're not much of a sports fan, it's about more than that, you get sucked into the life of the people in this town, and the passion that goes into their team. I really do recommend watching the pilot before making a decision on whether you want to watch it or not, it's my second favourite TV series ever, (after GoT of course.)

If you're deciding which one to try first, I'd go: Friday Night Lights, Archer, Eastbound &amp; Down, then Trailer Park Boys

Probably not, when this is demonstrably false.

I mean, we see newspaper articles all the time about job applications made by people with Ugandan names being rejected. When the same guy submits the same resumé under the name Bill English, the employer can't stop phoning him.

It ain't all sweetness and roses out there, y'know?

Black teenagers *know* they get stopped and searched and harassed by the police more frequently, because it doesn't happen to their white friends.

And it's all very well saying ""oh, they fit the crime profile"", but you wouldn't like it if it happened to you. You wouldn't think it was fair.

I've even heard that teachers may discriminate against the black kid when primary school kids are squabbling or misbehaving or fighting. 

I know it's hard to appreciate this, if you haven't lived it. I haven't lived it, either, so I would have said many of the same things you do, only 3 or 4 years ago.
You wrote a reply to me a week or two ago about the UKIP - stuff like this is why I can't accept their ""political correctness"" platform. Let's say I accept that UKIP policies aren't racist, can you appreciate that they must *feel* racist to those who have to live this life?

Let's say it's ""politically correct"" for the BBC to issue guidance on minority representation in commissioned shows. If you want to scrap that, all that PoCs are going to hear, the TV watching public, is ""they want fewer of us on TV"". They know they suffer discrimination, because they live it, every day. And this is not just people ""playing the victim card"" - one thing I can tell you is that being messed about by the plod ain't much fun.

&gt; I dunno, I'm only thinking out loud, I certainly don't believe I have all the answers.

I think that's owed more to the fact that it has to be represented in 2-D space and there isn't a good way to represent right angles to 4-D lines in 2-D, let alone 5-D and so on.

I don't think anything in the video flat-out (see what I did there) contradicts Flatland. A, B, and C were all brought up in the video, for example, point A was expressed with the mobius strip, B and C were expressed with the balloon.

true,Microwavability,lfc68,,"David Moyes is a clever bloke and a smart manager. European football is still football, he'll handle it well. His experience as a football manager over 15 years will give him the respect of the 'big name players' that you mention, and these players aren't a bunch of school kids getting a new teacher, they're professionals, that's why Ferguson got them for his team.

And frankly, since when did every team have a distinct 'style'? Sure, Barcelona have their tika taka, Tottenham press high, Arsenal have an attractive passing build up and we (Rodgers) like to keep the ball. But what's United's 'style'? Concede the first goal and then score more than the other team? What's City's style? Reading's? Teams don't HAVE to have a 'style'.

Moyes has 'tactical experience', as he's been managing for a decade and a half. Turning games around against great opponents? It's still just football mate, score more than the other team, that's all you need to do. Anyway, didn't Moyes beat a 'great opponent' in the first game of the season?

What makes you think that United will suddenly collapse in on itself because their manager retired? It's the same team, same players, Moyes won't get rid of all their players, it'll still be Ferguson's team, mostly. Also, you have to consider the possibility that Ferguson had some part in choosing his successor - he wanted Moyes as his assistant at one stage, he obviously respects the man, and so should you.

You'd be foolish to think that Moyes will be a massive flop; he might have a tricky start, but who wouldn't trying to fill Ferguson's shoes?

He'll be under massive pressure s3 and the presence of SAF in the directors box will be an issue for him. Then it becomes crucial. If Utd stick with him , I think he'll end up doing well.

He may sound reasoned in this video, but he's just a racist thug. I've been to a fair few EDL rallies (on the anti-fa side I should probably add lol) and they are in no way respectable. 

Looking at the EDL through the context of the UK it's easy to see them as an absurd irrelevancy, but economic crises make people's lives more difficult and some turn to scapegoatism to explain they're misfortune. Look at Greece and the rise of the Golden Dawn, for example. Even UKIP's success in the recent local elections was largely done so on the back of anti-immigrant spiel. 

It's not the fault of immigrants for the diminishing living standards and opportunities of the working classes, it's the fault of the wealthy right and their neo-liberal policies. My understanding is that immigration is actually low in this country, one of the lowest in Europe.

- Adebayor played his heart out, on one hand I'm happy. On the other I'm pissed. Why hasn't he shown this more? He could've helped us bag so many more points...

- Parker and Thudd were a wasteful CDM pairing.
AVB lacked the balls to play CDM + Holtby + Siggy. 

- Huddlestone was very wasteful with many of his set pieces. 

- I have never liked Bale's central role that much, but he's made up for his lesser involvement in the game with a lot of goals. However, when he doesn't score, he doesn't contribute as much centrally, as he does on the wings.

&gt; Learn these things before you think of coming to the UK, living costs are high around London and other cities but mostly it varies. The same applies for your salary. They are the two most important things. Where about in the UK do you plan to move? Again, you may not like some of our jokes but you'll have to learn to like them. People may joke about you being gay but they really won't have a problem with it. It's not like you'll get refused a job for being gay or anything like that but still have a sense of humour about it.

true,Raeli,cnty-expat,"Once Leeds, but now Amadora, PT","If you can find it, try find a private rented flat, preferably with either friends or someone else to share the flat with - that is an actual normal private flat, and not a flat advertised for students.

If you can find one, you should be able to find a 2-3 bedroom flat, pay all your bills (and since you're a student you are exempt from council tax), and you should be able to save a fair bit. Myself and 2 friends lived in a 3 bedroom flat, 2 bathrooms, and a pretty big living room, a decent fully fitted kitchen, and after utility bills and so on, split three ways, it was about £30 a month cheaper than living in student accommodation.

Not only was it cheaper, but it was far higher quality, much nicer to live in, and generally quiet - and it was still within a mile of the university.

You will have to sign for at least 6 months, but after viewing the accommodation before going to uni and then after going there to see other friends, I was so so glad I didn't go there. In comparison to the flat I got, the accommodation was a shit hole. One of my friend's gf's did the same as us and moved into a flat with friends, we were very lucky with ours, but theirs was still far nicer than student accommodation, and while it wasn't as new as ours, it did have a nice back garden which was cool for bbqs.

We also only actually started looking in August, because we're terrible like that, but we found a really good place, which we found through a lot of googling of the area :P

I know it's generally the case that you move into somewhere with friends anyway later, but if you have the ability to right away, I can't recommend it enough. Not only this, but again, it seems that most students do end up moving into privately owned places where they charge you the same as they do for student accommodation - X amount per person, rather than for the property as a whole. This is shit because you spend far more than if you just rented a property, and secondly because you often have little control over things such as your internet provider and internet package.

And before people say that dance is copyrighted, the movements of the dancers are not, the whole show needs to considered a dramatic work and be original to have any kind of protection. This includes the story, set, music etc. etc. If I watched some show and copied a dance move from it I would not be liable to anyone.",0,1368047186,null,0,false,0,c9v1di3,t3_1dvx7j,t1_c9v1di3,t1_c9ufy3g,null,1431257947,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Why just recently the eleventh Doctor went through a relatively large change, becoming a recluse bitter with the outside world and resentful for losing the Ponds. That's a pretty major change in his character.

One also should consider his accepting of death towards the end of Series Six (at least, before he weasled out of it).

In both instances we have some serious development coming from Eleven, and yet in both instances we have a pretty strong return to status quo. At the end of the episodes where the Doctor goes through a change he unfailingly returns to his old self at the end.

This is particularly worrisome because according to the timelines Moffat's set out, the Eleventh Doctor has been around for centuries upon centuries and the Tenth and Ninth Doctors were only around for a small handful of years.

Britain is a very good place to live if you're gay, in large part because over the past 10-15 years we have acquired a great deal of legal protection. For example you cannot be fired for being gay or denied services, in fact I think the UK was named the best place to live in the EU for gay people.

Socially, most younger people (under 35/40) have little problem with homosexuality. I'm out to my family, friends and at work and have never been mocked or criticized, even my 83 year old grandma is completely accepting of me. 

It's important to note that the law requires your employer to protect you from discrimination and bullying at work, so even if somebody were to have a problem with you, you wouldn't have to just accept it.

Homophobia is still present in Britain, from personal observation it's strongest amongst people who are poor/stupid/old/religious or any unfortunate combination there of, but it's decreasing year on year. You still have to be aware and careful, but it's much better than eastern Europe.

I do feel that the tone in the article is trying to play down the abuse.

I'm still where I was with my original comment, it feels like Daily Star [Paedofinder General](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCywGhHQMEw). 

We're chasing after events that happened in a totally different world where people didn't want to hear about abuse. I don't think it's even possible for it to happen again in the modern world. That doesn't of course excuse them.

By the power invested in me by a text poll on sky news I pronounce....

The conclusions I can't agree with. Perhaps the law should treat 14 year olds having sex with 16 year olds differently than 15 year olds having sex with 30 year olds - but I think judges already do.

A statute of limitations, again I'm not sure, obviously there's a benefit, but I don't think the cost is high. We'll go through by the looks of things everybody in the 70s but it won't happen again so I don't see a gain.

And removing complainant anonymity.. I don't support that either. I do support making the accused anonymous though. 

But as the article goes on I do feel I agree with her comments on the language being used and that we shouldn't get so emotive about crimes that we let ourselves wallow in name calling and prejudice. Anyone who is disgusted by how the USA went batshit racist after the twin towers attack might know what I mean.
