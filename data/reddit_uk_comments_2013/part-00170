About 10% of the cars in my area have at least one broken light. Loads of them drive at 40mph everywhere oblivious to speed limits. I think they should set the fines at a rate which funds sufficient traffic officers to allow the current traffic laws to be properly enforced. In fact, to be honest, if there was an excess and the fines funded other policing I wouldn't mind. I suspect that's not how it works and the money just goes into a big pot and then disappears never to be seen again, as with everything else in this country.

People in this country seem to have an expectation that it's their right to break the speed limit, park anywhere or drive with a mobile in one hand, and get all offended when god forbid anyone should actually try to police the roads.

The sonic can also be used in interesting not-directly-offensive ways that would couple well with a game that leans more on stealth and *avoiding* danger rather than hitting it head-on.

Just off the top of my head, here's some of the things a video game sonic could do:

* Distract enemies with a noise much like throwing one's voice.  
* Stun enemies with a sonic screech
* Hack into robotic enemies
* Shut off lights
* Disable security systems
* Act as a divining rod to follow clues *a la* Batman's Detective Vision

As for Morgana and Arthur, the producers/writers actually talked about that. In the original legends, obviously incest isn't a biggie. But for a TV audience that includes kids, they had to squash that right away from the beginning. So the first few episodes you see Arthur and Morgana flirting, but as the show develops they realize they can't go on with that so they squash it and change their relationship to a family friendly one.

Apparently (and by that I mean according to Wikipedia) the University of Warwick is one of the top three universities under fifty years old in the world. I'm not sure how big a deal that is, I'm sure places like Oxford and Cambridge which are pushing 1000 years care that much for example but still, it's a nice thing to have.

The town of Warwick is just down the road from Coventry city centre, probably less than ten miles to the south as the crow flies. 
There is some confusion though, I'll not deny that. I work in public transport and I can tell you for a fact that every year new students will get the train to Warwick station rather than Coventry, but because the University of Warwick campus is on the south side of Cov then a taxi doesn't really cost much more in terms of time or money.

true,cuppatea133,null,null,"He was very good for Shakhtar and hugely impressive in their Champions League campaign last season, causing the likes of Juventus and Chelsea all sorts of problems.

He's extremely fast, skilful and creative.

He's already made one £30m transfer in his career and if it wasn't for Anzhi getting rid of their entire squad we wouldn't have a prayer of signing him.

He's been chased by a whose who of European football in the past and both City and Spurs have made big efforts to sign him in recent times.

He was rated the 26th best player in the world by The Guardian writers and is the 5th most valuable left winger in the world according to transfermrkt.com.

He only turned 25 a week ago.

Watch this video - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgArAVDAiBc

Here are some of the match reports of his Champions League games last season (I know Goal is shit but it gives you an idea):

""His pace frightened the Nordsjaelland defence from the start. Scored two; the second a brilliant swerving drive into the far corner."" 5/5 motm.

""Lined up on the left against Chelsea but given licence to roam infield. Displayed magical footwork and found space in the centre time after time, turning home twice after cut-backs from Fernandinho and then Srna."" 4/5 tied for motm with Fernandinho.

""Was a genuine threat all night for the home side, giving Chelsea problems every time he had the ball. Should perhaps have had a goal of his own, but was the heartbeat of Shakhtar’s attacking moves."" 4.5/5 tied for motm with Fernandinho.

""His accomplished display showed why so many clubs were desperate to get their hands on him during the summer. He troubled the Juventus back line time and time again with his speed, close control, and awareness of his teammates. The only blot on his performance was his shooting, as he agonizingly missed a few great chances."" 3.5/5 motm.

Ordinarily we would have no chance of landing him but the mess going on at Anzhi has provided us with a rare opportunity to sign a top class player who would give us a huge attacking threat down the left and allow us to move Coutinho into the middle to his preferred #10 role. It would be a huge coup to land a player who is generating interest from a host of top European clubs and is probably the only opportunity available to us at this point to get someone of his calibre.

A front 4 of Sturridge, Suarez, Coutinho and Willian, with the likes of Aspas, Sterling, Alberto, Borini and Ibe waiting in the wings is mouthwatering imo.",0,1376712324,null,0,false,0,cbph87t,t3_1kim6d,t1_cbph87t,t1_cbpfthp,null,1429800023,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8

Curious about where you are from - I am also an Arizona gal who lived in Cambridge, and I will be there a lot visiting my boy who is doing his PhD there (I am doing mine at another UK uni). But if you want to chat about the experience, let me know! I am in Tucson until late September. :)

Edit: I also went to Anglia Ruskin so can answer questions about that, too! 

Second Edit: So I was realizing I could be a lot more helpful, but I had to get off my phone and use my laptop to do all the typing. =) Here goes a better reply to your post!

I wouldn't worry about being too ""prepared"" - the culture shocks I experienced in England were things that slowly crept into my life, rather than big, jarring differences between that and the USA. Initially everything will be super exciting - the accents, almost dying because you step into a crosswalk (""zeh-bra crossing"") and look the wrong way, the new foods and brands. Then you find you get used to it for a while, but be prepared for a sudden hit to the stomach a few months in where you realize ""Oh my god, this isn't HOME"" and all the differences are suddenly exacerbated. But, luckily, you get over that, too, and adjust to life in the UK.

Mostly I ran into things like... I'm loud. I don't say ""please"" often enough (but my ""thank yous"" and ""you're welcomes"" were abundant). You'll miss American wait staff. Bag your own groceries at the check-out counter. Prepare yourself for drizzle (get a waterproof jacket and an umbrella), and, related, prepare yourself as an Arizonan to get a little bit or a lotta bit of Seasonal Affective Disorder in the wintertime. You will feel as gray as the weather outside when you get only a few hours of daylight, especially coming from our beautiful sunshiny state.

The university system is very different. You said mid-twenties, so I'm going to assume you have done American university before this. Grades are very different. The American percentage system (90-100 = A, 80-90 = B, and so on) will have prepared you to feel shitty about your first 65 (which is a very decent grade, despite looking like a ""D"" at first glance!). The UK grades are First(70), 2:1 (60-69), 2:2 (50-59), and Third (35-49). You may not need to worry so much about this if you're doing a research degree.

The system is also a little more geared towards students working on their own. There is a lot less class time per course in the UK. Sometimes I preferred this, and sometimes I didn't. Again, if you're doing research, that might not matter at all unless you're lecturing. The classes themselves are pretty similar, except in terms of assignments. There were far fewer weekly graded assignments in the UK, and hardly any ""participation"" grades like the USA. This would probably depend on your field (I did English Literature and Creative Writing). Most of the time I had just two major essays/projects due, one halfway through term and one at the end of term. If you have exams, they might be all in June, even if your class finishes in December.

I'm sure there is oodles more. Ask anything else! And feel free, if you don't have plans to go home, to join me for Thanksgiving, which I will be hosting at my boy's place in Cambridge. That can be one of the first big hits of the year for homesickness. 

x (everyone ends their texts/msgs with ""x"" or ""xx"". It doesn't mean they want to kiss you, it just shows affection!

If you're in the city, the jury's out on the new SU building, but it's got the first new club to be built in years... so we're excited.

Ocean Wednesday is an absolute given, the stuff legends are made of. Try following 'Ocean Spotted' on Facebook/Twitter to get an idea.

The Forum and Ocean are both sponsored by the university which means only students can get in and good deals. Outside of that, Rock City is MASSIVE and great for a night out, if you don't mind sharing your night with the local sixth formers. Coco Tang is a really fancy bar that lots of students in my first year went for as an Ocean Wednesday alternative now and then (an excuse to wear a blazer and nice dresses).

At the end of the day it's difficult to tell you what you'll like because there's something different for everyone. Suffice it to say as someone who's visited many friends' unis in different cities, you have picked the most fun university and the one with the most diversity.

Personally speaking, my ""style"" had always been hair with a quiff, smartly but casually dressed (suit style), with converse shoes and a long jacket....so I kinda got the humph when Tennant's Doctor was the same...mainly because being a Doctor Who fan (myself) and Tennant becoming my favourite Doctor for (for clothing reasons described above, as well as being just awesome) people seemed to forget that that was the way I'd always dressed and thought I was doing it out of some solidarity and hero worship for the 10th Doctor.  

But my feeling (and I became a fan in 1996 with the movie, then going back and exploring the classics) is that (in a good way) Doctor Who is AS MUCH about the identity and sense of belonging as much as it is about the storylines and the characters.  

I, personally think its great that because of The Doctor more people have bought bow ties, converse trainers became cool again, more people bought leather jackets, had an interest in funky scarves...........and ate leak? 

As much as Matt was seen as the young, handsome, ""fangirl"" Doctor that doesn't bother me because I would much rather people were obsessing over something good quality, interesting and intelligent than One Direction and High School Musical.  

Everybody has their reason for joining, their doctor they will be devastated to lose.  The people who are quoting bow ties and fezzes as their lynchpin will continue (in most circumstances) will explore the classics and will develop.  I say well done to Moffat and Smith for creating an identity that young people, yet again, wanted to buy into and further ensured the longevity of such a wonderful and important tv series.

I am hoping this is simply a matter of supply and demand though, once ticket holders realize they won't get £200 for their nosebleed seats for a Category C match, the prices will stabilize. I was looking at Everton's stubhub and tickets for the Tottenham game were going for £32 for seats on the lower deck, so hopefully that's where we end up. Stubhub's admins fees are ridiculous, and there is no workaround for that, meaning to get tickets at face-value, season ticket holders may have to take a loss, which is unfair for them...

Showing us the Doctor's grave and exploring the idea of ""The Doctor"" having a greater meaning than a name might be a way to prepare us for the character being killed off. It's not necessarily what I think they'll do, but they might want to leave themselves as many options as possible when it's time to make the decision.

In that case they'll need a replacement to take up the name of the Doctor, which may very well be female since he has a granddaughter. I don't know who else would be passionate enough to follow in his footsteps and want the same name. Again, not a path I'm expecting them to take, but a possibility.

I think one advantage of that from their point of view would be the ability to move to a female lead without having to come up with a contrived explanation for the shift (in the Doctor's particular case, since he has shown no previous signs of gender-flexibility). 

It would also allow them to do it as a surprise, since gender-blind casting would give the game away fairly quickly and a replacement Doctor could be brought onto the show in advance without any fanfare.

I think meeting people at the first time at these kind of things is always gonna result in misreadings etc, as I certainly thought you were a cool guy and there was definitely some common interest there, I think the problem was it was kind of hard to hear opposite sides of the table so that is probably what I would put down to what you thought of as a clique, as we switched things up a bit later in the night so both sides got a chance to mingle etc. These are all things I wanted and hope to deal with once we're all more familiar with everything.

It'd definitely be great to see you again, and I think the core of some regulars is already coming together, so definitely don't feel like you have to commit anything, part of this is just putting it out there to see if there are people who want to and then newcomers or busier and not so sure folks like yourself can then drop in and out whenever you fancy.

~~Next season will be fantastic. Arsene Wenger, the last of the old guard, Jose Mourinho, the nightmare of the Premiership returning, Ian Holloway, the court jester making a fool of everyone, Paolo Di Canio, the fresh faced fascist afraid of no man, David Moyes, taking up the reigns of the red-horned beast, Brendan Rodgers, 'This year will be our year', Tony Pulis, still battling it out on a wet Tuesday night...
Mancini is a free man, Martinez is a wanted man, Redknapp is a haunted man, and Benitez - well, no one knows really.
But all the while, the devil himself gives a smile, winks, and whispers 'Squeaky-bum time'~~

This season will be fantastic.

Arsene Wenger, the last of the old guard with a team in dire straits - the window a disaster, with the saga of Suarez the Jester leaving Nicklaus Bendter as their true martyr and saviour. Dust settled on the warchest in July as Wenger was scouting a young Frenchman from a Ligue 2 side, but the German and Argentine went their separate ways, reminiscent of I Heard It Through The Grapevine by Marvin Gaye. And now with the deadwood shipped to shore, and a squad of nineteen, no more, how can Arsene get his side to the fabled spot of number four?

Across the street, lilywhites dance and sing to a trumpeter's song of marching in. The White Hart pub is in good cheer, and why not? The names of Soldado and Paulinho ring over the fans drinking beer. A young Andres is back on his feet, orders a Bailey's, eyeing over his teamsheet. He looks to the floor as he feels a nudge at his heel. 'No, Gareth you are not going to Real!', shouting at the chained orphan. Near the back end of the pub, hard-bargain Levy argues with a Spanish businessman, proclaiming that he wants four packets of peanuts for the orphan. 

Opposite the pub, Fulham Retirement Home's residents are having a hard time coping with the loud noise from the pub. 'Young'uns these days!' is among the groans that fill the air of the activity room. Nurse Martin Ratched can be heard conducting experiments, as he tries to turn his team of OAPs into Frankenstein freaks of nature. 'It's alive!' he proclaims, as Berba-Bent, a malformed body of the squads front two combined, steps out the door.

Overlooking the whole street stands the majestic Crystal Palace, home of the comedian Ian Holloway and his Flying Circus. They dream of one day finding the Holy Grail and staying in the premiership; yet their hopes are diminishing, as their manager has recently started working on a film titled 'Life of Ian', where he portrays himself as the Messiah Jesus Christ Our Lord And Saviour. And now for something completely different.  

Just like a scene from smash hit TV show Game Of Thrones^TM, the young David Moyes has succeeded his father, Ser Alex the Scot, as leader of all ~~Westeros~~ England. However, doubts are emerging about his leadership - he is cruel and unforgiving, highlighted by his recent execution of Bebe the Usurper and the stripping of all Knight Scholes' lands and titles, and his banishment to foreign lands. He has failed in securing the alliances of either Fabregas of Barcelona or Fellani the Bold for his attack on the North. His support is dwindling - how long will it be before the peasants (and glory hunters) revolt?

Meanwhile, United's rivals, مدينة مانشستر , trek the deserts of Arabia, hoping to find the lost ~~warchest of Arsene Wenger~~ title of the Premier League. With Manuel Pellegrini as their Lawrence of Arabia, the search may be over soon. With the recent acquirements of Sheikh Navas, Sheikh Negredo, Sheikh Jovetic and King Abdullah Fernandinho, the concubine looks ready to pounce on the league once more, hoping to retrieve the treasure they had lost two years ago in similar fashion. ‘Asa lama lakum!’ as John Motson would scream.

The tiger roars and bites down on its teeth; the dragon arches its head towards the sky and breathes its fire. In the dense jungles of the South-Eastern rainforest, the exotic Hull Tigers and Cardiff Dragons dance the dance of death. To the victor, the spoils – another season in the Premier League; to the loser – condemnation to the murky depths of hell (alright, the Championship). The bluebird lays dead in the thick green grass; the sun rises on a dawn, a new future. The tiger stamps its feet; the dragon flaps it’s wings – the two rush forward toward one another in the clash of the ages. 

‘Das dritte Reich wird für tausend jahre dauern!’ proclaims Pablo Di Canio to the ~~Hitler Youth~~ Sunderland squad. The team is like no other, following Di Canio’s three principles to the letter – discipline, order, and leadership. This makes Sunderland an efficient, ruthless, Geordie-killing machine, destroying those weaker and lazier than the Black Cats. For their claws are sharp, their wits are strong, and their faith unwavering. Submit to the Stadium of Reich!

‘Viva la vida!’ Napoalan Pardew shouts, rallying his troops as they prepare to storm the Premier League. Behind the fortifications of Nouveaux Château, revolution is afoot – the second influx of Frenchmen at the club has given hope to the supporters of the Republic. ‘Le roi va mourir!’ they chant to the tune of Le Marseillais. However, strange happenings beyond the hold of the revolution are taking place. First, the appointment of Joe Kinnear into the ranks, who ‘built the Earth in six facking days and St James’ park on the seventh’ – his brashness and wild demeanour are ruining the mentality of Napoalan’s army. Second, Napoalan himself, who, despite leading his troops to death many times, has somehow managed to keep the rank of Commander. Time will tell if shall face the guillotine. 

*Liverpool - once almighty and powerful, now a shadow of their former glory. They have sold their deadwood, brought in depth players, but their star player is rebelling against the side...* 

'Daaaaad, you told me I could go out tonight!' Louise pleads to Brendan. 'Not in that Arsenal top you aren't, get back in here you slut and play Monopoly with us!' Brendan answers, with Coutinho, Agger and Sturridge crowded round the boardgame. 'But you let Stewart and Andy go!' Louise proclaims. 'I didn't let them go I disowned them! Now, do you want to be the top hat or the thimble?'. Louise runs up to her room, crying 'You just don't understand me!'. 'Louise, we need you - you're the best Monopoly player in the family!' Brendan goes running up behind her. 

'Left! Right! Left! Right!' Jose yells to his players. Back from his excursions in the continent, Mourinho looks upon his team proudly, a platoon of strong, young men, ready to liberate the Premier League title. But just then, he spots a sloucher in squad, a player who has slowed down to catch his breath. 'Halt!' he commands the players. He walks up to the tired player, grabs his chin, and within an inch of his face, talks to him. 'And you are?' he asks snidely. 'Pri-Pri-Private Torres sir' the man answers. Jose laughs, a beaming grin upon his face. 'Are you the special one?' he asks. 'I'm sorry sir?' Torres asks, puzzled. 'I said, are you the special one?' Jose repeated. 'Well no, you are sir'. Suddenly, Jose pulls out a pistol from his belt and shoots the Spainard dead. 'And don't you forget it!' Jose proclaims to his squad. With a manager back for blood, a squad with ambition, and an owner with oil, where can Chelsea go wrong?

Anyway... the clubs of the Premier League are ready to go head to head in the most open season since the league's inception. Twenty teams will fight it out for the Holy Grail of English football - twenty strong, ambitious teams. Almost everyone has improved their squads (sorry Arsenal), and the stakes are higher than ever before. 

And all the while, the devil himself gives a smile, winks, and whispers 'Squeaky-bum time'...

It seems with tips in USA waiters can take home $300 (tax free) on a good night and the customers love feeling like they have the power to ""encourage"" good service and have the power in their hands to demand better work from them with the leverage of their spending power.

It seems to encapsulate the concept of the American dream. They perceive that it doesn't matter who you are, if you work hard and have a good attitude you can make plenty of money. And also the power that a customer's tip is perceived to give over the work of someone serving them, that money buys power.

It was strangely enlightening but that BBC article is worth a read, but more importantly have a read through the comments. It's a cultural thing there that just makes no sense to me at all.

Different planets. 

Different timezones on Earth (what you do in one time affects the future, similar to what goes in the Eternity Clock, but with more freedom, ties back in with point 2)

Companion(s). I guess this could open the way to multiplayer, too. 

Could be based on episodes, but doesn't have to. A separate storyline works too. 

As for gameplay, there are many routes you can take, but time-based missions would definitely fit in there. Some platform kind of puzzles would also be nice. (especially across different times, again, similar to The Eternity Clock, but with freedom. Not being guided through it)

* We used to say no to switches. We don't any more, since a computing project required the use of them and we couldn't really say yes to some people and no to others. However there is no *support* for using them. If you have any issues while using one the first support request should be 'Plug your computer straight into the wall. Does it work now?'. We require all machines to be registered on our network, which involves a subnet change, so having a mixture of registered and unregistered devices on a switch can cause unexpected behaviour.

* SFTP is nicer to our NAT gateway than BitTorrent. We don't see switch uplinks maxed out or similar yet, but we do see high connection counts and CPU use at the border from all the P2P traffic. If you're not doing BitTorrent through our network, we don't care when you download or how hard you run it, until you hit your monthly limit. Then we throttle you (Homer Simpson style ;) ). Same goes for Steam etc.

* What sort of VPN is it? IPSec should be fine. PPTP can't be nicely run through NAT without breaking the spec, which only Cisco do. Our border isn't Cisco, so if your VPN is PPTP it might never work, might work intermittently, or might be fine, depending on factors we have no control over. We provide no support for connecting to external PPTP VPNs.

Are gays facing ""systematic brutality and often murderous hostility that means that every morning you wonder if you and your children are going to live through the day""? No. Gay bashings are rare and unions have been legally recognised for some time.

Are blacks facing ""systematic brutality and often murderous hostility that means that every morning you wonder if you and your children are going to live through the day""? No. In fact they often have access to social housing and welfare benefits.

The Master uses all his regenerations by the 4th Doctor. From that point on he is obsessed with living beyond his death. This is where he learns to take over other bodies. He inhabits the Keeper of Traken during the 4th Doctors run and stays in that body all the way to the 1996 movie. 

The Master's eyes were that way in the movie because of the events of the last broadcast episode of classic Who, *Survival*. It would take a long time to explain in detail, but when it comes down to it he absorbed the violent rage filled power of a god-planet.

After he is killed falling into the Eye of Harmony after the movie, he is later resurrected by the Time Lords in the Time War and given a new set of regenerations, which has always been in their power. The Master runs away from the Time War, and then regens into John Simms' Master.Later, at the end of *Last of the Time Lords* the Master decides that the last way to hurt the Doctor is not to regenerate and die leaving the Doctor alone. This was a ruse, of course, as the Master has other ways of surviving death.

So after rent and school dinners she has £690 to £800+ to live on. Food can be done very easily for £150 a month. Gas/Electric £50-£60 a month, £12 for TV license, £30 for water, £100 for council tax, £30 for phone/internet. 

She is in Hull. £550 a month gets you a 2 bed apartment on the Marina.

In short she's using food banks because she's shit with money.

You literally did:

&gt;Something has changed from previous generations.

I don't know what else to tell you!

&gt;my point was that children breaking the law know they are untouchable now, and they know that the police will not bother to investigate.

No your point was that they are uniquely bad compared with other generations.  Every and all of these speculative incidents you can come up with in your mind may correspond with an actual incidents in this and all previous generations to varying degrees.  Some young offenders may think they're untouchable and some won't.  Some will get away with it and some will get sent to young offenders institutions and be absolutely terrified.  This is true today and true in the last generation and the one before that. There may be more today who think they can get away with it than in the 50s, though some were certainly like that in the 50s, but there may also be fewer today than the 90s.

&gt;As for lower crime levels, if the police refuse to investigate and log a crime that does not mean that a crime has not taken place. People that swallow crime study statistics at face value are as gullible as the Daily Mail broken Britain idiots.

That's a lot of bile from someone coming from a position of ignorance.  There are two kinds of crime statistics - crime reported by the police **and victim surveys**.  Burglary, violent crime, fear of crime are decreasing according to *both measures* and these trends, as I said, are consistent accross many Western industrialised nations.  Crime has fallen in the last 20 years by any measure.

Take building a PC. Do you actually know what a DMA, IRQ and reserved memory allocation is? Would you know how to find out what your hardware was using? You've been brought up in a time where PCs are PnP where you don't need to know any of this shit because its taken care of by the system. When I started building PCs you needed to know the DMA, IRQ and memory address of ALL hardware in the system and how to set it manually using jumpers and how to manually edit configuration files otherwise non of it worked and your system wouldn't even boot if you got a conflict. Difference between using and understanding and why when some error causes such conflicts I immediately recognise it and your generation's technicians don't even have the first clue what the fuck is going on.

Your and subsequent generations are making more frequent use of it but in no different way to the way my wife uses the washing machine.

No, you (solely) can't affect anyone else on a wired connection if you max your 100mbps. Everything up from you is connected at gig or greater, and the Uni border is 20gbps, unless they've completed some upgrades while I was away. OK, all it would take would be 10 people like you to starve everyone else of their bandwidth, but our experience is that most people use significantly less than 10mbps, just browsing/checking email. If more people start maxing their connections, and doing it 24/7, we might have to investigate further. But with 100GB quota you can max out and get throttled in 2.5 hours on a 100mbps connection, so unless we start saying there is no quota we're not worried about people hammering their connections occasionally.",0,1376740493,null,0,1376757474,0,cbpm0yp,t3_1kji4w,t1_cbpm0yp,t1_cbpltbe,null,1429797784,2,false,lancasteruni,t5_2swbr,2

- How the fuck was that not a penalty? The bloke was trying to rip the shirt off Poleon's back!

- The linesmen (especially the one by the East Stand) are really pissing me off because they take an age to decide whether or not the ball has gone out for a throw-in.

- Sheffield Wednesday are playing with more energy and determination than us. They're constantly in our faces and giving us almost no space to play in. I know that it's not a perfect representation of the atmosphere in the ground, but on TV it even sounds like their fans are outsinging us.

- I'm not even sure where our goals are going to come from. Poleon and McCormack seem like the most likely threats - we really need to get Poleon running with the ball whenever possible - but we're really lacking a clinical finisher, or the type of winger to give us dangerous width.

You won't be able to legally work here so forget that idea. It takes an age to get a work visa and the numbers are restricted with very strict application criteria.

So, the first thing you should do is look at a map. I guess that you are American. England is a bit bigger than the State of Mississippi and a bit smaller than the state of Louisiana (about 2 West Virginias, or half an Oregon). Getting on for 90% of the UK population live in England. Being “closer to England” should not be a problem for you.

&gt;what would I need in order to get a job?

If you were to work here you would need a job *before* your move to the UK, and your employer would need to sponsor you. UK employers absolutely *will not* do this for someone who plans to stay for 3 months. Unless you happen to be a word-class brain surgeon or something of the sort. If you are indeed American then [you don't need a visa to vist but you will need to prove that you have enough money to support yourself](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/visas-immigration/visiting/) without working for the length of your visit.

having a vasectomy have rightly been explored. He has been broadly been in favour 
of the idea although in his most recent session with CH and ZZ on 23 July 2013** and 
with Dr Milnes, he expressed a view that he would prefer to use condoms. Neither 
CH nor Dr Milnes think these recent meetings are wholly to be relied upon. On 23 
July, DE had just learnt that a very close friend had died and was deeply distressed, 
in addition, he had just had a session in which the issue of pain immediately following 
a vasectomy was discussed with DE. CH thought that this may have been the 
influencing factor. Dr Milnes’ final view is that if it is explained to DE that a 
vasectomy is foolproof in relation to “no more babies”, but that he might conceive 
with a condom he would go for the vasectomy. ",0,1376743364,null,0,false,0,cbpmf5f,t3_1khaxl,t1_cbpmf5f,t1_cbpla1r,null,1429797601,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,HugoChavezRamboIII,eng-norfolk,Naaaarch,"As other commenters said, seek legal advice, which you should absolutely do, but, since you asked for the law on this area to be explained, I shall oblige.

The starting point, as always, is primary legislation. This relevant Act is the Suicide Act 1961, which in S.2 conveys criminal liability for *A person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the suicide of another [...]*.

Two key cases have challenged this in the courts, *Pretty* and *Purdy*. Both have sought to rely on the European Convention on Human Rights.

In the case of *Pretty* the House of Lords (acting in it's (then) judicial capacity) unanimously rejected that Article 2 ('right to life') could be read to incorporate a 'right to die'. The Court also rejected her Art. 8 ('respect for family life') argument, relying on the qualifying provisions of Art.8.2, holding that interference in this right was *necessary in a democratic society* for the protection of others.
*Pretty* appealed to the ECourtHR, arguing that the blanket ban on assisted suicide was discriminatory, under Article 14, as she was severely disabled, though was unsuccessful.


*Purdy* also sought to rely on Article 8, arguing that the Suicide Act 1961 interfered with her right to respect for private life (her personal autonomy and right to self-determination), saying that the interference was not 'in accordance with law' (one of the qualifications of Art.8 in 8.2), as the Director of Public Prosecutions, dissimilarly to virtually all other offences, had failed to produce an 'offence specific policy' for prosecutors, which would set out the factors taken into account when deciding whether or not to prosecute under S.2.4 SA1961. Purdy argued that the DPP was required to produce such a policy in order for the qualification under Art8.2 to be effective.


Here the HoL sided with the appellant and ordered that the DPP produce such a policy clarifying the position of the CPS, which the DPP, Kier Starmer QC, did in 2010.


[[CPS Assisted Suicide policy for Crown Prosecutors](http://www.cps.gov.uk/publications/prosecution/assisted_suicide_policy.html)]


The policy itself has made things a bit clearer, for example: The DPP now personally has to approve prosecutions under SA1961, and if you are a third party to assisting suicide, IE you encourage the person who assists the suicidee, then you are liable under the amended S.2A SA1961. The public interest section is also clearer on the factors.


This is just a really short run-down of the present state of assisted suicide in the UK, **do not *rely* on anything I've said here**. I've written this up for the purposes of giving an overview of the law as it stands, as requested, and nothing more.",0,1376743471,null,0,1376743816,0,cbpmfre,t3_1kfqjs,t1_cbpmfre,t3_1kfqjs,null,1429797593,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Obviously the parents should be supervising, up to a certain point. That doesn't render the role of educators moot. They can do a great deal of good, in a short amount of time, with a degree of clarity, specificity, content and context many, probably most parents lack the resources to provide.

true,BigRedS,cnty-uk,London,"&gt; But look at how many IT courses are offered through universities/colleges nowadays.

Yes, and look at how many of them are well-regarded. The original reason we came down to willy-waving as far as being real men who wrote our own drivers is because of the laws the Government keep proposing highlight a lack of understanding of computing and the internet. For that you don't simply need people who've done a ""business and computing"" class or something - much of education (including higher/further) is in the same sort of position as Government wherein the addition of computers to anything makes it a computing-related course, regardless of how well computers themselves are studied.

&gt; The very fact that computers, and in particular the internet, are now available to everyone means that the knowledge is also available to anyone who wants it, which just wasn't true 25 years ago.

No, but I don' think the number of people who *want* to know why it's technically quite difficult to implement a porn filter has increased. That aside, if it's available to everyone it's also available to people who aren't in the 20-40 age bracket.
 
&gt; Also consider that a lot of this fabled knowledge that the previous poster was so chuffed with himself for possessing doesn't need to be used any more, because it's been made redundant by new technology.

More than that it's not even the sort of understanding that this thread started off decrying a lack of.

true,chochazel,null,null,"&gt;I said something had 'changed', and you read this as 'worse'. 

Stop being disingenuous.  Of course you meant worse.  That was the whole point of the post!  On what *planet* is your little rant about how the latest generation not a clear statement that they're worse!?!

You called them ""little bastards"" and used words like ""plagued"".  To backtrack and now pretend that you weren't describing them as ""worse"" just ""different"" is just excrutiatingly embarrassing!  At least have some dignity.

&gt;I also never accused you of saying that 'all crime has stopped'. Read it back. 

You were responding with ridiculous truisms which amounted to nothing more than pointing out that crime exists and is a bad thing, which I was never disagreeing with because it's obviously true e.g.

&gt;""real people have real problems and receive no support.""

&gt;""You are obviously fortunate not to be subjected to anti-social behaviour which is nice for you""

My point was that you are arguing as if I were saying that all crime had stopped; I'm not disagreeing that crime exists and is a bad thing, I'm disagreeing the current generation are worse or (sorry) ""different"" in a more bastard-like way.  Telling me that people suffer from crime would only make sense as a counter-argument if I were claiming that they didn't.  If you don't think I'm claiming that crime today is not a problem, then stop making these emotional appeals as if I were.

&gt;You are a fantasist. You enjoying typing etc.

Enough with the ad hominem attacks.  If you want to call me gullible for saying crime is falling, don't be surprised if you get a clearly factual response backed up with evidence from the Crime Survey for England and Wales.  That's not because I enjoy typing, it's because I like dealing in facts, not rhetoric or fantasy.

I still feel that we look like conceding a goal every game, though, but in fairness so do most Championship defences.

true,newpathstohelicon,scot-lanarkshire,Glesga,"&gt; For that you don't simply need people who've done a ""business and computing"" class or something - much of education (including higher/further) is in the same sort of position as Government wherein the addition of computers to anything makes it a computing-related course, regardless of how well computers themselves are studied.

Well obviously there's a difference between learning the nuts and bolts of it and doing a Computing 101 class where they teach you how to make spreadsheets in Excel, but there are still far more courses offering the former than there were in the late 80s.

&gt;No, but I don' think the number of people who want to know why it's technically quite difficult to implement a porn filter has increased. That aside, if it's available to everyone it's also available to people who aren't in the 20-40 age bracket.

Sure, but it's more likely to be the younger generation getting into it, if only because for people in their late 20s/30s/40s who didn't learn these things first time round aren't as likely to start a university course as people in their late teens.

&gt;More than that it's not even the sort of understanding that this thread started off decrying a lack of.

Yeah, that struck me after my last response.

true,squirrelpocher,num1,,"I would say august 2009. I wanted to get into football for the world cup. did a bunch of research and was initially drawn to the team because of the awesome name. then I read up on their history (lots of ""first team to do..."" ) and loved it. saw they were perpetually almost there and realized...shit this is my team! my good friend at the time was a chelsea supporter but I just couldn't latch on with them because it was to bandwagony.  the first game I remember watching was Liverpool-Spurs opening weekend. I had already decided I hated liverpool (watched a game were Gerrard scored and was a complete cunt throughout, he is my least favorite player in the premier league). seeing BAE score that long range effort and my happiness at it was my signal, this is the team. I completely threw myself into the team that year but had to follow games through espn's gamecast ( I didn't know about illegal streams and only could watch the games if they were on ESPN360).  the sheer terror/anxiousness I had waiting for every minute by minute update was unreal. I was already an addict.  they made the champions league that year (what a year to pick to start following!) and I got a jersey the following year of a young LB that had a good 8 game stretch at the end of the year (my chelsea pal had taunted me about how his jersey had a champions league patch). the Number 3 Bale jersey arrived the day of the inter milan away game. I gleefully wore it to genetics lab and watched the game the whole time. I was making so much noise/trouble that I had to move to a different room. I turned off the game with 86 minutes gone and spurs down 4-0 because I hadn't done a lick of work only to chekc the score 5 minutes later and see the game 4-3, after that I never ever turn off a spurs game early no matter what.

I have an irrational love of Huddlestone (RIP) and Gomes (I still think he is an amazing goalkeeper). I never understood why everyone loved modric so much (sorry SuperLuka, i Just remember him breaking his leg at Birmingham and our team still doing fine that year). and BAE is by far my favorite player in any sport ever.


I found this sub when it was just barely 300 (might have been under) and now it is pretty much the only reason I go to reddit anymore. I have found Spurs fans to be an amazing bunch and I gladly wear my lillywhite jersey and get the heckling from bandwagon arsenal fans who think their manager changed his name to match the team's name. despite only following during good times, I still smugly know that to be a spurs fan you need to have the resolve to with stand the inevitable let downs that will occur yet never be surprised when our team blows a team like Inter out of the water. and while other clubs my loudly proclaim you won't walk alone, a spurs fan knows that they are part of a bortherhood/sisterhood where bonds are forged not through winning but something stronger. when I lived in England, I walked into a spors apparel store where they had listed all the winners of the league for the last century. the double winners were in yellow. seeing Spurs as the first team on the board in Yellow brought me so much pride I just stared at the board for a few minutes. that event occured more than 25 years before I was born, yet I was still proud of my team.we are an unique bread and quite frankly, the best fans out there.

the trophies is there for the taking!

I disagree that things are different.

true,ActionPriest,null,null,"&gt; the risk of that is kids are educated about specific sites, applications or properties and will have problems when things don't behave as they expect, rather than just engendering some kind of general common internet sense.


Why is that the risk? General internet common sense is EXACTLY what these lessons when they are covered by schools teach. The problems is that this practice is not yet widespread enough, nor is it approached in a joined up, or consistent manner.

These are general principles about not sharing information, or over exposing yourself in some manner, and the likelihood of someone you are talking too not being who they are, the risks of trusting people you have not met, as well as the importance of going to an adult for help, and the damage and risks of cyberbullying.

These are all general points, every bit as universal and translatable as fire safety. All relatively easily communicated, but not necessarily obvious either to many parents or to children. And all inadaquetely covered and funded in most of the maintained education sector, due to the refusal to create national requirements for pastoral care.

I have no idea what shoot em ups, or similar violent games have to do with this, or why you brought them into it. This is about giving children the knowledge as to what are high risk on-line behaviours. No different from teaching them the green cross code, the need for a fire safety plan, the use of condoms, or very young children not to talk to strangers.

Conservative tabloids and pressure groups may be inappropriately conflating these issues, but that doesn't mean reasonable people should.

I know you think it is, but you're going to have to learn that the American idea of a 'cultural heritage' isn't really a familiar concept in the UK, or even Europe. An extremely Irish name *does not make you extremely Irish.*

While you guys are a country of immigrants historically, and therefore put a lot of stock in where you 'come from', people here just can't associate with that. To be honest, I have a ton of close American friends, and even they would find the idea of someone three generations removed from Ireland calling themselves Irish laughable.

Few thoughts:
God damn Begovic, should've been 4 past you. Away keepers just find a way to perform brilliantly at Anfield. 



I thought Hendo was brilliant, seemed like he was charging down loads, interrupting plays, and definitely helping Lucas and Gerrard with the defensive roles.

 I thought Sturridge looked hungry-ish, thought he made a few poor decisions when we were breaking but overall very happy. And I love how he gets to the line and whips the ball across the ground in the 6 yard box. If Suarez was playing he'd be all over those. 

Lucas looked quickkk. 

Gerrard was Gerrard, but with a bit more hollywood today. 

Coutinho was holding the ball a bit too long against a team as physical as stoke, and lead to him getting pushed off the ball a fair amount, but I don't even mind because of how clinical and crafty he is. 

Our fullbacks pushed up so far forward, and got wide meaning we're not as narrow coming forward as I feared, although Willian would still help that. But this did mean that Johnson was leaving a few gaps, meaning we are a bit susceptible to the counter, but we managed quite well.

Mignolet - I wasn't impressed until that penalty save, now I'm very happy with him. 

Agger and Toure paired up very well, and Toure's better on the ball then I previously thought. Agger... I'm not exactly sure what you were trying to do, but eh worked out well enough.

 • UK Phone Number 0844 844 0102 (option 1)
• Overseas Phone Number +44 207 998 1068

In regards to sigining up your step son and maybe yourself, there is no need to sign up to a Bronze membership if you want to as economically safe as possible. A Lilly white membership (below Bronze) will have all the benfits you would expect with a Bronze membership, apart from an 1 EXTRA DAY special ticket allocation for people to buy tickets before they come out on sale to other members. They usually set aside 1000 tickets for anybody that absolutely wants a ticket desperately. They are sort of like VIP tickets in some sorts. 

This leaves around 30,000 tickets left to buy the next day. That is all Bronze membership would offer you for the higher membership price. An extra day to get ""VIP"" tickets. Of course this can be valuable for Arsenal games but generally I don't think it is worth the membership cost. UNLESS you want to be also put on the season ticket waiting list, then purchase Bronze as this will not be available to you with a Lillywhite membership. 

Junior membership comes in:

* Striker (11yrs-15yrs)

* Kicker (3yrs - 10yrs)

* Dribbler (0yrs - 2yrs)

Glenno: solid enough at the back and has some awesome touches in the stoke box, but not super great end product. 7/10

Agger: solid at the back, except for that handball. Those runs forward look nice but never really amount to much. His assurance on the ball is still a big reason why we can play it out from the back so calmly though. 6.5/10

Yolo: super solid, all we needed. 7/10

Enrique: was actually REALLY great at the back. Looks completely out if ideas when he has to play it fwd though .... Still great match. 7/10

Lucas: Wow..... He looked like a huge pain in the ass to play against and his distribution was much more instinctive and accurate than last year. 9/10

Gerrard: solid enough recycling possession most of the time, but also a bit sloppy at times. Not up to his standard and for not creating much, I think Allen would have played this role better. 6/10

Hendo: same as Gerrard.....solid recycling. Got into some good positions for himself and unlucky not to have gotten a goal or two. Didn't really create in the 8 10ish role and think cou should have been there. 6/10.

Cou: god those through balls were insane. A bit over elaborate on the dribble though. Still deserved at least 3 assists. 8/10

Aspas: awesome movement and energy, not a ton of end product, but it will come I think. Great buy. 7.5/10

Sturridge: honestly a bit sloppy and had some horrible first touches. Could have scored a couple more, but really well taken goal.... That's what he is in the team for. 7.5/10",0,1376748657,null,0,false,0,cbpndqq,t3_1kjrhj,t1_cbpndqq,t3_1kjrhj,null,1429797118,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Started watching after the World Cup. I followed the advice of a friend who said to pick a team and follow them, but watch as many different teams as I could.  Good advice.  I'd picked Villa to watch - mainly because I wanted to see how this team (which had been performing very well) would respond to having their manager quit just before the season started (not well, as it turned out).

Villa could be excruciating to watch that year (Houllier, I believe, had them on right track but Dunne/Collins undermined him the same way AVB was undermined at Chelsea, IMO).  Spurs had Bale, Modric, VDV, and an albino version of Manute Bol.  They were interesting. Exciting to watch -  Fun to follow (w/o any history following the league, I thought Redknapp was GREAT - didn't hurt that he used to be a Sounder back in the NASL days).  The closing of the January transfer window had me enthralled.  Harry doing interviews seemingly every 1/2 hour from his SUV, wondering if Levy would pull another VDV style coup in the final hours...

But what cinched it was watching Bale at the San Siro.  Just...WOW!  Then Jordan and Gattuso getting into a fight!  Now that's just something we don't see over here in the US.  Yeah, I understand that makes me part of the bandwagon, but I don't really care.  I love this team!  COYS!!!

As a side note, I do worry that with a new stadium to pay for, their spending has me a little worried - I want them to win and nab a Champions League spot, but I really don't want to see them take a Villa-style fall from grace.

EDIT:  I especially love Villa today

true,Nessunolosa,cnty-uk,"Previously USA in London ","&gt;Health insurance in the USA isn't that expensive, most people have it. Mine was about $140 a month.

My friend was quoted $2400 a month the other day. My parents, when my dad lost his job, were quoted $6000 a month for five family members who are all in good health. 

And then there are hidden costs like the fact that my insurance has never (until Oct. 1) covered women's health visits and birth control. Or the fact that when someone truly gets sick with cancer or something likewise serious, their insurance plans often refuse to pay and leave them penniless. The #1 reason people lose their homes and go on benefits in the US is lack of health insurance, and estimates say around 45,000 die waiting for care each year without it. I am one of the millions of uninsured people. It really is a big deal. 

&gt;you can afford a car and gas.

Actually, I've never personally had a car. I can drive, but I've never been able to afford a car and gas (and insurance). I'm in my mid-twenties now. So the lack of consistent and relatively reliable public transportation is a huge deal to me, especially living in the suburbs as I do now. 

Everyone's standards of living vary, so it's possible that the standard of living in the UK may suit me better.

Also, some of the world's greatest philosophers and scientists have been religious, and religion certainly does not mean someone is stupid or their opinion is not valid.

You have also equated having religious beliefs with a blind following in the bible and denial of scientific facts, when in fact there are plenty of religious people who don't follow the bible and believe in evolution etc.

I find it a shame that you are narrow minded enough to assume that atheism is completely and utterly the only logical viewpoint and that anyone who doesn't share the same opinion as you must be less intelligent.

true,sprucay,null,null,"I would have killed for BCC, especially considering the subjects! So don't forget that even though it wasn't what you wanted and it isn't three A's, BCC is still a really good result. I got CDE in biology, IT and chemistry. I didn't get into my first choice university, but I did get into another through clearing. I did have to change the subject slightly- I went from biomed to biological sciences (as it turned out that was better- I much preferred the ecological side to biology than the human medical side) 

So, my advice- Firstly, find out if you can get any allowances on medical grounds. If you were seeing doctors and stuff, I'm sure they can write letters to exam boards etc. and maybe take into account medical grounds. Or, look for the same course at other universities, or look for similar but different courses at Southampton if you're set on going there. I know it seems like the end of the world that you can't do exactly what you planned to, but it isn't! Going onto the retake option- unless the medical problems caused savage memory loss, I very much doubt you'll need to relearn from scratch. I'm sure you could find tutors or even online revision sites to revise for the exams adequately. Or if you have really nice teachers, they might help out over the summer. 

But I'm just a stranger on the internet. Call UCAS and they can give you proper advice.

But most importantly, ***It is not the end of the world!*** at the very least, you can use the fact that even though you were massively ill and had a breakdown you still got BCC as a selling point for getting a job.",0,1376753287,null,0,false,0,cbpojku,t3_1kfdyf,t1_cbpojku,t3_1kfdyf,null,1429796576,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3

true,SMTRodent,null,null,"1. A job is not happening. We have more than enough workers, and even if you happen to have a specialisation we need, a few months isn't long enough. You'll be living on savings. You could work illegally for cash, but it would be a stupid and dangerous thing to do, since that that point you're dealing most often with human traffickers. If you see a job advertised that applies to your situation, and that you think would help support you on a short-term visit to the UK it's a scam.

2. Wear what you like. Wear layers, so you can adjust for abrupt changes in weather. The climate in the UK is temperate, with no real extremes of cold or heat - -10C is the minimum, 30C the maximum that you're at all likely to see and the most common temperature range will be around 8-15C. Europe has a more continental climate, with colder winters and hotter summers in many places, but at that time of year it won't be that different.

3. Food and petrol will be way more expensive than an American would be use to. Prices are the total price you pay, with no hidden taxes, so if a price label says £2.50, then £2.50 is all you pay. Accommodation is also expensive, especially in the short term. You'll also need medical insurance - the NHS is only free to UK residents. London is much more expensive than the rest of the country, but also has far more to see and do.

I wanted to choose a team to follow. Obviously, it had to be a London team in the Premier League, but I didn't want to choose Arsenal or Chelsea because I didn't want to just jump on a bandwagon, like some ignorant American who had only ever heard of the ""Big 4"" teams.

West Ham and Charlton were out because they were too far east.

So my choice was Spurs or Fulham. I almost went with Fulham, because of Brian McBride, it was just after the [2006 World Cup.](http://itsalwaysgameseven.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/mcbride.jpg)

But an Australian friend was a Spurs supporter, and he convinced me to go with Spurs. Also, I lived just off of Tottenham Court Road (not in Tottenham, for those who don't know), so I made that connection too.

My Australian friend had been supporting Spurs since the 1991 FA Cup, but we shared our first trip to The Lane. It was against 'Arry Redknapp's Portsmouth, and it was Judas Campbell's first game against Spurs as a Pompey player.

Even though I only lived in London for a relatively short time, I managed to see Spurs several times at WHL, in all 4 competitions. A couple highlights were Paul Robinson's 85 yard goal against Watford on St. Patrick's Day 2007, and the Ar5ena1 League Cup Semifinal in January 2008.

I also went away to Villa Park and Stamford Bridge in the League, and I traveled to Europe for the preseason tournament in Rotterdam in 2008, which were the last Spurs games I attended before I moved back home.

Some teams do have their players doing the exact same thing each time, I think it's called zonal marking where they just have areas to cover and pick up anyone who happens to be there. I vividly remember that kind of marking system being blamed for the goal we conceded in the League One Play-Off Final.

I think that we sort of do something in-between zonal and man marking, because I've noticed that a lot of our players have the same tasks each time: Warnock is generally on one of the posts, while the likes of Lees and Pearce cover the opposing centre halves and Austin tends to cover their main striker. So they usually have roles that are relatively the same each time, but of course they will go over what they have to do in training and before the game.

Yes. About 5 or 6. At the rate they're going at they could quite easily finish behind Liverpool this season.

Today was a dark day in the history of Arsenal Classy Sawker Club. They faced a fire drill at the 80th minute and the stadium was still emptying by the 90th. Thankfully no one was injured though some players were reported to have been injured. This could have turned really nasty by the speed the fans had to leave the stadium, I mean an actual fire would have made them leave less quickly than this.

To save cost Arsenal have even had to buy a cheap suit for Wenger which says it all. Thankfully though as their banners say at the Emirates, ""you cant buy class"" so I'm guessing their problems will be fixed very soon for no cost what so ever which is a good result for the overall Premiership.

Never the less they are still the classiest club in England and therefore the world.

Edit : [Pictures of the classy supporters of classenal on the opening day of the season. Best support ever amirite??] (http://imgur.com/a/1pXek#1)

Edit 2 : **All of this happened in 1 match for Arsenal**

- Diaby, Vermaelen, Monreal, Miyachi, Arteta, Gibbs were injured before the match.

- Arsenal are first in the league before the match starts.

- Match starts and Arsenal take the lead inside 10 minutes, fans already aiming for 4th place.

- Arsenal start playing like shit, end up conceding 3 times partly due to the referee, mostly due to them being utter shit

- Koscielny gets red carded

- Rosicky playing like MOTM, Rosicky now reported injured.

- Ramsey injured

- Sagna aims for the sky, nearly dies, now injured

- Alex Overrate-Chamberlin injured, out for 3 months

- Koscielny misses next match

- Arsenal are in relegation zone post match, tied at 19th

The fact that players like Whittaker - who was superb and my man of the match - and Bennett, both of whom looked like they'd be hard-pressed to get game time this season, played some good football bodes well for us. 

Redmond looked dangerous going forward, but was a bit of a liability when it came to defending, getting caught out a number of times by Coleman. However, he'll improve with time and hopefully develop into a quality winger.

Van Wolfswinkel did exactly what we knew he was capable of, and he should very well be that force-up-front that we were somewhat lacking last season. Snodgrass seems to be exactly the sort of player to compliment RvW as well, and I'm really hoping that these two can link up and produce some magic.

Fer will hopefully step into the midfield role comfortably and add a bit of stability to the centre of the park, as we looked a bit shaky at times there today.

Shakhtar had bids from City and Chelsea but they didn't meet their valuation of €35 million, so they would only let Willian speak to Anzhi.

He bitched after the move that Shakhtar blocked him from moving to England for over 18 months, since they were not moving on the fee they wanted.

This is why I think we will put Willian on our mid-tier wages of £70k per week. Even with the increased tax rate it is a significant pay rise for him and it fits in with how we pay players. That would likely include significant performance based clauses. 

This is the reason it is worth stumping £30m on him, the guy is relatively cheap on wages for one of the best players in the world (especially compared to some of the wages we pay other players).

Going anywhere over that level on wages would be an admission that we are facing stiff competition. The good news is that Willian has wanted to move to England for nearly 2 years now and needs the move for his national team prospects (Russia is a wasteland for Brazillians in terms of the national team, Hulk is the only player getting picked and he only recently moved there).

&gt;Thanks for your email.
&gt;
&gt; On the whole, I believe that the internet is a force for good. It is central to our lives and our economy, and Ministers have to be wary about passing legislation which might stifle it. Nevertheless, the internet has also brought a number of problems, with easy access to pornographic material definitely being one of them.
&gt;
&gt; Taking these considerations into account, I believe that the best way to tackle this problem is through a self-regulatory model for the industry; legislation can rarely adapt and change quickly enough to respond to the constantly evolving online environment, and state intervention therefore has to be light touch, proportionate and effective.
&gt;
&gt; The Government is applying this approach in several different ways. For example, the Prime Minister has made clear that he wants ISPs to configure their systems to actively encourage parents, whether they are new or existing customers, to switch on parental controls where there are children in the household.
&gt;
&gt; On top of this, Claire Perry MP has been appointed as an adviser to the Prime Minister on Commercialisation and Sexualisation of Childhood. She has called for a better, well advertised system for parents and children to report inappropriate behaviour online, and a shakeup of the school curriculum so that internet safety is taught in IT classes.
&gt;
&gt; I do hope that this information helps and thank you again for contacting me about this important issue.
&gt;
&gt; Yours sincerely,
&gt;
&gt; Alec
&gt;

&gt; Conservative Member of Parliament for Elmet &amp; Rothwell -
&gt; Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister of State for Northern Ireland

If you want to meet Brits and not ""be like a tourist"", it might be a good idea to find a flat share or house share to rent, so you would be living with other students or locals.  There are probably websites, or resources at your friends university that can help you find this sort of accommodation.

As many people have pointed out, you won't be able to work legally, so you might get a bit bored.  Suggest you might want to take some classes, either in the same university as your friend, or another in the same city.  Maybe for credits, maybe just for fun.  You will also meet more Brits if you are involved in classes or some other activity.  You might want to investigate and apply soon.

For touring around Europe, Ryan Air and Easy Jet from the UK are often very cheap.  You can probably go to several places for a weekend.  If you can, rent a car for some part of your tour.  You can only see cities if you travel by trains and planes.  For places to stay when touring, you can go with youth hostels, but, particularly if traveling with a group, check out airbnb.com for flats and houses to rent which won't be much more expensive.

I hope some of the predicted line-up that the Guardian posted is true. Mainly that Lukaku starts up front. 

If today has shown anything it's that young players are eager as fuck to make a mark on their clubs. Ross Barkley scored on his debut today, Luke Shaw grabbed an assist with Rickie Lambert, Luna scored, Benteke put in 2 past Arsenal (lol), The Studge scored for LFC, and Danny Welbeck grabbed 2 as well.

We can do this, our young players can do this. Normally I don't like to be super optimistic but I'm expecting a rout of Hull. Lukaku scores, Hazard scores, and De Bruyne or Van Ginkel grab some assists or put in some crucial ballage.

I believe we should return to an economic union with Europe, creating trust and standardization of certain products, this would of cause benefit us economically, trust breeds strong economies. A European Commonwealth of set norms, values and economic interests not a central, very poorly construed, pseudo-democratic, dogmatism. 

Cost, why do we need to pay for more and more MPs, Commissioners, councilors, bankers, courts and all their expenses?

Democracy, EU law has to be passed by the commission (not voted by universal suffrage). When do your MEPs hold a surgery? They don't, they never (/very rarely) meet their constituents face to face, to address and represent their issues, that's civil service.

Federalization, different laungages, different histories, different economic status, different healthcare systems, different social needs, different education, different welfare, different systems of government, different taxes, different laws. A glimpse of history will show this doesn't work. 

Supremacy, a judgement made in the British 'Supreme' Court, over British law legislated by British MPs voted by the British is inferior to EU law.

Economy, no one wants Swiss made watches or Norwegian gas because they are outside the EU? If Germany left would no one buy BMWs any more? i don't think so. People will still watch west end shows, try and get their kids into ox-bridge, buy the rights to the premier league, ect.

Make-up wise I try to go for the ""natural"" look, though it takes quite a bit of time. I started using Bare Minerals because the liquid foundation I was using was ruining my skin and I don't really like a cakey layer on my face. Don't think I could go back now, BM is amazing! A bit pricey though.

I tend to go for bigger eyes for an everyday look (pencil liner on upper eyelid, mascara) - don't wear lipstick for work but will if I'm out/having a day off. I don't have an eyebrow kit but I use eyebrow powder to darken them slightly as I dye my hair so it looks weird if my eyebrows don't match. They also need a lot of taming unfortunately.

Cillian Murphy is lovely! I've been watching Freaks and Geeks lately (hah) and James Franco is very easy on the eyes...

Christina Hendricks is a cool dude. So classy, I love her style.

I don't think I could possibly choose a favourite film but if I had to choose a few... Lost in Translation, Pulp Fiction, Romeo and Juliet (Baz Luhrmann version), Trainspotting and recently, Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil (that film is AMAZING!).

&gt;Talk to me about things that you do/like which aren't stereotypically female.

I mentioned in the ""unexpected hobbies"" thread I play the drums and drink ale (and make it too). I also play a lot of video games (just spent almost my whole week off playing Fallout: New Vegas, whoops!).

Where on earth did you get that impression? It certainly didn't arise in the parliamentary debates, where it was very often emphasised just how good Britain was for gay rights.

The same sex marriage bill was entirely the work of parliament. There was little to no input from pressure groups and campaigners, who were for the most part pathetic on the issue. There was a private members bill, that had the votes to pass, forcing David Cameron to act and take control of it. In terms of ideology the argument was pressed on the issue of basic equality, not victimhood.

The persecution point is really only raised in the context of the treatment of lgbt children and young, where genuine, quantifiable, well documented levels of abuse, and horrendously disproportionate rates of homelessness, mental health issues, family abandonment, marginalization, both within the education system and without, victimhood of crime and physical harm etc still exist

I would also like to add, I do not know a single gay person among my circle who has not at one time or another been subject to physical assault, often very significant, for being gay. That experience pretty much stays with you forever, and does leave you with an element of fear for your wellbeing simply for your orientation. Homophobic abuse and threats of violence in public are not rare enough yet to be a surprise. 

I have never met any group of Christians in England who have faced that. I have encountered it in Scotland due to sectarianism, which absolutely reaches the level of persecution in many contexts.

On topic, it's gotta be John Mikel Obi who's most under-appreciated.  He's by far the most loyal player on the team among players under 30 years old, and is the only thing remotely close to replacing Claude Makelele that we've had, which is incredible considering we bought him as an attacking midfielder, and Mourinho molded him into a defensive midfielder.  A reverse Lampard, if you will.

Yet time after time, he's left off of starting XIs that would get crushed in the midfield with lack of balls won.  Lampard/Ramires?  Please.  That happened numerous times last year when Obi was unavailable, and it was ugly.

I do think Cech is under-appreciated in the sense that everyone remembers the CL final for Drogba, when Cech was probably the MVP, but people also fail to realize how well Mikel Obi and Lampard controlled the midfield to limit Bayern Munich's options to as much as they did.",0,1376775752,null,0,1376779462,0,cbpv8j3,t3_1kjz8s,t1_cbpv8j3,t1_cbpsjep,null,1429793381,6,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,6

I'm writing this as if you know nothing so please don't think I'm being condescending, just don't want you to think British people are rude (I've heard this a lot from tourists/foreign friends).

* Prepare yourself for our customer service because it is probably going to be a lot worse than you're used to. In many shops and restaurants it is not expected for staff to be overly helpful or welcoming and staff may even be openly rude to you. Try not to take it to heart!
* Tipping taxi drivers, takeaway delivery drivers, barmen/women, etc. is not usual (you might round to the nearest pound if paying in cash). Tipping in a coffee shop or cafe is not expected, even if they have a tip jar, and people may just leave spare change. At a restaurant or hairdresser, a 10% tip is fine, but not obligatory (eg. if the service was bad, don't leave a tip). [More info on tips here.](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Travel-g186216-s606/United-Kingdom:Tipping.And.Etiquette.html)
* You may have heard about our obsession with waiting in line in Britain. If you cut in line (we refer to it as a 'queue'), prepare for people tutting at you or possibly calling you out for your behaviour. If you're using public transport, you should wait for people to get off before you try to board.
* 'Watching the English' has probably prepared you for the background and attitude of lots of Cambridge University students, many of whom can be insufferable snobs (especially when it comes to ARU). Again, try not to take it to heart.
* Cambridge really is lovely for the quaint, traditional English experience - many students and residents cycle around the city, and you can explore on foot, by bicycle or bus, or by punting or boating on the river. There are also lots of museums, galleries, bookshops and independent shops. If you're looking for cheaper shops, head towards the Grafton Centre end of town.
* Things to do: Visit Kettle's Yard gallery, the Fitzwilliam Museum, Botanic Gardens, Whipple Museum (really all the University museums are worth a visit - a lot of them are free!). Go punting (pay extra for the guide unless you're going with people who know Cambridge well, it really is worth it). Shop at Poundland/Primark/New Look/H&amp;M/TK Maxx for cheap essentials and clothing, Ark if you're into the vintage thing, Forbidden Planet (you like Doctor Who so you'll love it), and the market is great for crafts, pop culture t-shirts, fresh fruit &amp; vegetables, and cheap watch/phone/bike repairs.

2. Filtered or not, under this system all traffic is shunted through the system, presumably with a backdoor into it so the government can monitor and protect us. Do I get a knock on my door for looking at the Labour party website? Maybe a company doesn't give the sitting government enough money for their campaign, then for a week the *accidentally* get blacklisted? Say the guardian exposes our government next time for significant breeches of public trust i.e. spying. No guardian website? Maybe a post like this gets me in trouble.

I don't get it. [The post was marked \[OT\]](http://redd.it/1kkfmd), was posted to get a Chelsea fans point of view and was generating Chelsea related discussion. 

Rooney was just confirmed by Mourinho and the club for still being our transfer target. He reacts like this to two goals, secluded from his team and I post it here as an [OT] even though it could have very well have been an on topic in the context and relevancy. It wasn't a post saying ""omg rooney to join United"", it was just to get a Chelsea fans perspective of the event which even United fans have been talking about.

&gt;we've got the round up thread for todays action

That isn't a round up thread, nor is it is rumor roundup thread. If it was either I would've posted this in the thread. You might have notice I posted what was relevant in that thread already but you cant just stuff everything that doesn't even belong in one thread in the hope someone will still come across and read it. 

It was also an OT and is an OT to even more of an extent than the one I posted which is at least directly related to what our manager and club just said yesterday.

&gt;It's picture of a non chelsea player in a match not featuring chelsea, how is it on topic?

It's a picture of a player linked with Chelsea, direct quotes from the manager and announcement through the club's official media playing in a match before a transfer window looking very much like he is unhappy. How is this off topic? I even tagged it off topic as a courtesy to save those who want to ignore it some trouble even though it is on topic. By this logic Rooney rumors should be deleted as well because I'm pretty sure someone is going to post the dailymail article showing the same pictures in a while and it wont be deleted.

______

I get it if I broke a rule that you just realized should be re-instated from today but you need to mention it as such instead of explaining things like ""if you want to post pictures of Rooney looking sad, put them in there please."". If this was a picture of Rooney being sad why would I post it here in the first place? I actually delete my own posts to save you guys trouble in the modqueue and also ask others to do so and this kind of behavior only throws off the community against you especially if they are putting in an effort.

Don't just look at submissions, look at posted content. You'll see that I regularly post in discussion threads with what I believe to be contributing comments. 

I enjoy participating in discussion, seeing art works that people have put together with originality, even videos. I'm a great fan of the greats like Seduff and VortexGuyz934

I don't like stupid jigglypuff impersonations, seeing a slightly different TARDIS cake, dress or card on the front page every week.

People throwing on suits and saying it's their David Tennant cosplay.etc.etc

I love good content, I am fully ready to admit that I'm not great at creating it, mainly because my artistic skills aside from film making and acting are terrible and every Doctor Who fan film I've seen has been pretty damn cringy, so I tend to try and make original content in that area, even if it completely fails sometimes. 

Good content, my definition:

- Something new and original 

It doesn't even have to be particularly good. Just no more DIY arts and crafts. Pretty much everything in that area has been done. 

Show me a good cosplay? I'll upvote it.

true,ennui_,null,null,"Hi, I'm in the reverse situation than you, from Cambridge and have moved to the states. I do miss Cambridge lots, especially the pubs on a miserable night - can't wait for my first pint back at the Cambridge Blue (Gwydir Street) - need to make sure I'm back for at least a week over xmas. 



I've always found activities around Cambridge for friends visiting quite difficult. The city is more just a very nice place to live other than one for lots of activities... I guess everyones got to go punting once, can't think of much else though. I'd definitely recommend getting a bike - it's hard to get one for &lt;£100 but it can be done - I got my last one at the market and it worked perfectly well for years so maybe try that. 


There are good bars etc. and many places to spend wet afternoons inside with a drink. Also you'll only be a 50 minute train from London so you have to spend a few days/nights there. Know that public transport in England is good. Buses, trains etc. all of good standard and run constantly so there's no need to drive unless you want to. 


Have fun, I'm a bit jealous at the moment, however nice the states is there's no place like home. Small shame you won't be there for the height of summer when the parks are full, but xmas time is Cambridge is pretty wonderful too. Autumn can be a bit miserable but as I said, lots of great pubs all over the place. 


Finally, you can walk the entire city in a day so if I were you I'd spend my first few days getting to know the area. Walking around Cambridge will always be a favourite past time of mine.

He preferred the idea of rule by 'the best', a select few Philosopher Kings who had proved themselves worthy to rule. There was even the allowance for a monarchy if only one person was a worthy Philosopher King.

So whilst Plato endorses a form of oligarchy, he certainly did not accept democracy. Also the term 'republic' derives from the Latin *Res Publica*, so Plato would not have described himself as, or been influenced by Roman ideas that had not yet developed.

- BBC ignore actor who they hired to act as #1 and find other guy

- BBC conduct top secret search for Doc #1 Lookalikes.

- BBC find guy somehow and hire him.

- Guy tells OP he's been hired and that it's highly confidential and not to tell anyone. OP ignores and posts on one of the most popular Doctor Who boards.

- BBC fly guy to London instead of the Doctor Who Studios in Cardiff. (The 1st Doctor's TARDIS Interior is also in Cardiff, obviously),

- BBC conduct super duper promos with guy that can't be done in home country with a green screen.

This summer was supposed to be different. We haven't sold Wilshere to City or Koscielny to Munich. 


New kit deals will kick in and we have supposedly have the biggest warchest we've ever had.


The stadium debt is manageable because of Wengers frugal spending in recent years. Now isn't the time for spending piss on Sanogo without stronger bodies to come with it.


We were betting on Bale leaving, Moyes flopping, and City/Chelsea buying £100M worth of players that can't *quite* put them out of our reach if we tried hard. (Fernandinho is half the player Paulinho is)


But then hell froze over when you bought a striker. And then a winger, and a two solid fucking midfield replacements (for Parker?)


Wenger says we can challenge with this squad. (The same squad he said could win last year. The same one that finished just a hair above you)


Wenger says prices are too high early in the window. He then says choices are too scarce during this kind of time.


He is not ruthless in the market like David Dein was. Higuain is gone. Gustavo is gone. He cleared our deadwood but hasn't done much to address the injury and depth issues. 

We are going to resort to deadline day signings most likely. Arteta, Mertesacker and Monreal were good DD buys. Park, Santos etc were not.


This is not how a team in our position should be spending. We need to break our transfer record, since you guys seem to casually do that every week.



Rant is over,  #coyg #foys and all the like. Good day all.

2nd - Davis made a bad call thinking he could win the header. He should have stayed with his man at the back post. The thing is, RVP's movement for an earlier chance in the same kind of position left Williams flat footed and RVP headed at Vorm. I guess Davis had this in his mind, but if he's going to go for it, he's got to win it.
3rd - Again, RVP is class. Chico's covering threw Williams off a bit, I don't think RVP would have have made so much space for himself if we didn't attempt to double team him. I put that down to being the first serious game of the season, I think the positioning will improve with more games.  
4th - heh, good ball and good finish.

Nice instinctive shot from Bony though, he didn't get a chance to really impress but I'll put money on him making 10/15 goals this season.

I disagree.  I think a week of training is enough and it could then be utilized against an inferior team (where the premise of a guaranteed return comes up).  It's not really a change in tactics or thinking, after all the idea is to meld the team to the way our best players already think, but more of a change in system.

&gt;this is practically a 4-2-3-1

I disagree.  Mikel would be doing a very very different job in this system vs in a 2-man midfield.  And Oscar would remain central with Ramires.  It's more like a 4-3-3 if we have to label it.

&gt;mourinho has always supported a system that exploits lightning fast counters and i dont see him changing his style any time soon.

I disagree.  José has always supported a system that gets the most out of his players.  He is a pragmatist and the cliché that he has a style is just that, a cliché.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I'm a British expat in America and I feel like I can offer some insight here. Not altogether positive.

I'm from Cambridge so I'm used to people being fairly aware of other kinds of people. We understand what foreign people sound and look like. We understand physically where they're from, for the most part. We understand some current affairs that may be happening in their homes, and the way they relate to other places.

It's not like that here in the American South. Because of their media here and the way they take in information, it is rare for someone to be as aware about the outside world as the average person is in England. Sometimes I think they don't really want to be aware of the truth of the world. They prefer a simple prepackaged Disney version of events. Hence their love of the ""fairytale"" Royal Wedding, or the dyed green beer of ""St. Patty's"" Day.

The popular conception of our culture is that being interested in it makes you more cultured. British TV is seen as high brow. This explains the massive popularity of Downton Abbey in the States. It's highbrow setting and tone matches the American perception so well that it has skyrocketed in popularity. This becomes a problem when you apply that perception to things that aren't naturally high brow. Doctor Who is a good example of this. A lot of Americans think they are ultra discerning sci fi fans because they are into Doctor Who. They think its some serious, hard hitting show. They don't understand that in reality it is anything but a high brow, serious, exclusive sci fi drama. It's just a mainstream family show.

Overall I think that a lot of lurkers think they are in some exclusive club that they understand a ""better"" culture than theirs. In reality we are just some spectacle for these people to use for their own purposes. They trivialise our culture because they would rather do that than bother to truly understand it. And even if they did really understand us and like our country better than their own, you have to wonder about a person like that.

And before some American comes on here to defend himself, understand that even in the act of posting he proves he doesn't represent the average person there. Nor will he be able to understand Americans the way that we would.

I find it interesting that you mention mikels position play as well. This type of deep lying midfielder is exactly the type of player AVB used in his 4-3-3 at chelsea, interestingly mikel failed to peform well and romeu was the player he favored as he recyled posession with higher efficiency. Mikel only began to play well that season with RDM switching him to a more traditional defensive player. 

I also think while mourinho does get attempt to get the best out of players, he has pretty much played the same system since he switched to it from a 4-3-3 in his second season at inter. Id also id point out that mourinho has spoken of the similarities in a 4-3-3 to a 4-2-3-1

I definitly wont try to pass off any kind of accent. I am terrible at them and understand how it could be insulting, but would it be wish to learn the different (correct) terminology for certain words (i.e. boot vs. trunk, bonnet vs. hood, crisps vs. chips, etc.) and maybe also the correct spelling (i.e. color vs. colour)?

The insulting complement is something I will have to get use to, but I am not easily offended and knowing this ahead of time I will pay attention to clarify whether or not it is in fact meant as an insult. 

For me this is more of a preparation, as I hope to move to the UK after I finish university. I'm very tired of America.

Henderson got into these positions due to the creative play of others. But he didn't convert a single chance. Thats fine because his job in this side isn't to score goals. Its really to be a menace and run all day. Some people slated him for the first half but he was the sole reason Johnson had so much freedom going forward. It was a surprising setup by Rodgers, with Aspas in the 10 hole, but one that worked quite brilliantly. 

I'm all for Henderson having a role in the team. Maybe he gets lucky and gets 10 goals in a campaign. But thats really all it would be. Henderson has not yet shown the capability to make his own goals or even, really, to finish chances created for him.

One of the brilliant things about the character is how human she is compared to the Doctor's definite alienacity. In fact, I think Chris's Doctor is the most alien of the revival; he doesn't have the quirkiness of the later incarnations, but he does have a dark, brooding qualit and a very different idea of morality.

I blame Russell T Davies for that. I loved Rose in the first series, but in series 2 I grew very sick of her. Her loveyness and clingyness towards the Doctor was awful, and I was thrilled that she was leaving.

(And I found that the fit she threw when realizing this 900 year old alien had a past, and was close friends with this other ""Sarah Jane"" woman was appalling)

So then Rose leaves, I spend months excited about the new companion, and what does Russell turn her into? A rebound. Rose 2.0... ""*Oh, I love the Doctor, but... oh but... he doesn't love ME...*""

Donna isn't among my favorites, but she was a breath of fresh air after all that nonsense.

I think that whole thing was a bit unfair to Martha (and maybe even Freema). She never had a chance. Russell didn't give her a chance, and made sure the fans didn't either. The one good thing he did for that character was give her the balls to leave the Doctor.

It all adds up to UKIP not only undermining Conservatives but Labour too, and they're far more likely to be targeting not only swing seats *but* outspoken Europhiles - and Labour has more of them.  There's quite a bit of prominent UKIP policy there which Labour supporters seem to agree with, and yet which Labour's policy on Europe can't deliver.

It's a bit of a misconception to assume that UKIP will only undermine the Conservatives, especially since either an official or unofficial deal after 2014 is not off the table.

true,ljuki,sontaran,Sontaran,"In my case Doctor Who as a series constantly surprised me by how many Companions I *didn't* hate. I tend to be really tough on female characters and if I detect any semblance of a cliche or Mary Suism it's enough to earn my undying hatred. Why? I don't know, man, that's just how I'm made. 

Anyway, weirdly enough in my case, I liked every single Companion in the new series, except for River Song. Rose, in my opinion, was a decent character, played by a good actress who just happened to come along when the ground was very shaky for Doctor Who as a series. They were still experimenting, they weren't sure how it would ""sell"" with the audience and therefore, I feel, weren't ready to commit to making any excessively deep and complex characters.

 If you look at some of Rose's reactions and interactions, especially with Mickey, they aren't quite what a real-life person would do. They wanted them to have had a relationship, but also they wanted to drop him quickly so she and the Doctor could go adventuring. This resulted in an unrealistic 'goodbye' which made Rose seem like a totally emotionless sociopath or something.

There were times I really liked Rose and there were times I went 'wtf' at things that came out of her mouth. What I most appreciated with her was the unforced playfulness with which she and the Doctor traveled. There wasn't much angst, there wasn't too much focus on her or on him, it was more about the places they went and the things they saw and that was brilliant. 

I feel that if Rose was written in today's series, she would probably have had a more stable and realistic personality that wasn't all over the place. ",0,1376806886,null,0,false,0,cbq4261,t3_1kl2qo,t1_cbq4261,t3_1kl2qo,null,1429789195,26,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,26

true,muhah666,null,null,"Well, I married one, and am currently living in California, so I suppose that I can't dislike them too much. 


Fundamentally people are the same wherever they are from, but yes, the culture can be pretty different. I tend to find Americans, and America (well actually the USA, considering the term America actually refers to two continents), rather superficial and fake. They often seem generous and friendly, but really they are out for what they can get, be it tips or whatever. Not in every case, and it seems like a sweeping generalisation, but it is just something that constantly bugs me. Like how friendly a waitress will be, and then you can see their smile disappear literally as they turn around. I have even taken to tipping the outwardly miserable ones more. I mean, I'd be miserable if I was a waiter in the US. I know that everywhere is like this to some degree, but it is just so much more apparent here to me than in the UK. 


Also, they are keen to let you know how well they are doing, or how much they own - everything has to be measured. It unsettles me a bit. 


They also deify doctors, and are overly dependent on medications in general. Too many people are on anti-depressants. Problems in your life? Don't fix them, just change your SSRI. This is probably a result of the private healthcare system. There are adverts on television advocating asking your doctor to prescribe you particular prescription drugs, which I find unsettling. Doctors should prescribe what they feel is best - not what the market, or 'consumers' want. And yes, they are consumers, not patients. My wife had to visit the ER (casualty) recently, and we had to wait hours for a Doctor contracted to her particular insurance company to come in and see her, despite there being many other doctors available. Something about that stank to me. I find the idea that people would go without medical treatment because they couldn't afford it abhorrent. Absolutely abhorrent. The bill for one night in hospital was $21,000. Yes, I did get the number of zero's correct. The insurance company refused to pay that, and ended up paying about $7,000. The hospital subsequently sent us a bill for $700. Which is ridiculous. But what is worse, is that they are billing people without insurance $21,000. Insane.   


Also, they are shit at driving, and their sports are shit. Having said that, the new blanket coverage of the English premier league is bloody fantastic, despite me having to get up at 7 AM to watch the game. 


Seriously, they are terrible at driving. The concept of slow lane, middle lane, and fast lane is completely lost on them. Also no-one seems to be aware of stopping distances, and drives too close behind you. Nobody indicates. This is a constant source of irritation to me. 

As for Texas - my only experience of that state is driving through it, and staying one night in Amarillo. Fuck knows why Tony Christie sang about it, the place is a shithole. Basically one road, with stuff either side of it. So I can't comment on the rest of it. But Storage Wars Texas is shitter than the original version, which is shit itself, so Texas didn't really redeem itself with that one. What is with all the cowboy shit? 


McDonalds and Burger King are worse here. Mcdonalds is even fattier and greasier, and Burger King doesn't sell the Bacon Double Cheeseburger. Probably because bacon in this country is fucking shit. It is streaky bacon. The sort of crap that we would throw away. Also, they don't have proper sausages. Seriously, I have been searching for months. However, they do have a very good fast food place called In-n-out, which is almost like real food. Go there instead of Mcdonalds etc. 


Chocolate is shit here. They sell Cadbury's and Galaxy (called Dove here), but it tastes worse. I think that it has more sugar or high-fructose corn syrup or something. Maybe that is the favoured taste here. Speaking of which, they would spell favoured wrong. Hershey's is an abomination.  


But there are some good things. I have a jacuzzi in the garden, and my wife makes me fresh orange juice from the tree in the garden every morning. So life could be worse. ",0,1376806914,null,0,false,0,cbq42di,t3_1klah5,t1_cbq42di,t3_1klah5,null,1429789192,7,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,7

Either way, you have to connect to the club . Only you could decide that over time.

The Time War took place sometime between the end of the classic series and the beginning of the new series. It's generally believed that the 8th Doctor was the one to fight in the Time War.

John Hurt is a 'secret' incarnation of the Doctor who rejected the title, so he's not part of the numbering scheme. It's not officially confirmed where he fits in the order, but the most common theory is that he came between the 8th and 9th Doctor and had some role in ending the Time War.

It is believed (but not confirmed) that John Hurt is actually the 9th Doctor (which would mean McGann regenerated into Hurt off-screen). It is also believed that John Hurt's Doctor is the one who ended the Time War (hence why he ""broke the promise""). If he is the 9th Doctor, that would now make Eccleston the 10th and Tennant the 11th. Again none of this has actually been confirmed yet - but I'm sure it will be in the 50th Anniversary episode.

Another thing to note, in the last episode the 11th Doctor says that Hurt's Doctor broke the promise, and therefore is not worthy of the name of the Doctor - so technically you could say Eccleston is still the 9th Doctor, Tennant 10th Doctor .etc

In the classic series there is another incarnation of the Doctor, called The Valeyard, who is said to be a future incarnation between the 12th and 13th Doctors, but this hasn't really been fully explained yet. And as for regeneration limits, Timelords are supposed to be able to have 13th different incarnations - so the Doctor is running out. This will probably be resolved in some sort of sci-fi way though. In the classic series I believe The Master gained an extra set of regenerations, so technically there is no definite limit.

Unless I've lost the plot, he's admitted to buggering off out wide because he was scared of missing chances. Scared of missing chances ffs! A 28 year old man.

The comparison between the treatment on here of Torres and Ba is so telling. One is an effeminate-looking 'nice guy' and is shit, yet gets chance after chance. Ba isn't effeminate-looking (although seems like a pretty nice bloke to me) and gets absolutely slaughtered. At least your post is the closest I've seen to an admission that the bizarre Torres love on here pretty much amounts to perverse, homoerotic fanboyism.

5 had overall the best run, with some really good episodes and few bad ones (Only one I can remember being awful was Victory of the Daleks).

4 (counting End of Time) was really good, Tennant's best series (IMHO).

1 had Christopher Eccleston, Dalek, The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances 2 parter, Bad Wolf/Parting of Ways, and Jack Harkness. 'Nuff said.

3 had the return of the Master, which I loved. Also Blink. And that is reason enough for the series to be ranked this high.

7 This is where I start to slightly dislike the series. I thought the goodbye to Amy and Rory was dragged out. And no goodbye from Rory, who I really liked. The Crimson Horror also ranks as one of the worst DW episodes of all time. But it also had Clara, and Name of the Doctor. Good.

2 was a pretty lacklustre series. I can't remember many highlights.

6 I thoroughly enjoyed the best episodes of 6, like The Doctor's Wife, and The Girl Who Waited. But the rest were pretty lacklustre.
But from the comments I have below about how good Series 6 is, maybe I need a re-watch and re-evaluation!

One reason is because I'm not a huge fan of love stories. I didn't even really like Amy until Rory is hanging around full time. She was also terrible to Micky practically forgetting he exists and lets 9 be rude to him. When she decides Micky isn't the one for her she doesn't really tell him and lets him go on waiting for her.

Another reason is because well I don't quite know hoe to explain it but she reminds me of those people who like go into the same profession as their father to get his respect and attention. She's trying to show off and be all time/space travelery to win his attention when the reason he picked her was because of her humanity. When Jack and Micky are around she has to show off.

The episode when 9 regenerates is probably why I dislike her the most. When she is sent back to Earth she isn't there barely an hour and she is complaining about how boring it is - what a selfish brat.

There is a potential undercurrent of racism, or at very least elitism. Diana's child (William) was in line to be king. Diana had started dating Dodi Fayed, an Egyptian-born chap. His father started and runs Harrods, a hugely expensive and prestigious department store in one of the poshest bits of London and is well-known in Britain, having been turned down for British citizenship. It probably doesn't help that Al Fayed Sr is a pompous and unpleasant fellow, who when given a platform is outspoken about lots of things he doesn't like. This includes British law and life when it disadvantages him..

In any event, even if the accident had not have occurred, the possibility of the heir to the throne having a sibling with that background would have sent the Royals into paroxysms of panic and the PR would have gone into meltdown.

I'm one of the (outgoing) founders of [Farset Labs](http://farsetlabs.org.uk), Northern Ireland's first hackerspace, so I've got a few questions, largely echoed here, that I don't think you've answered at all. 

But before that, any project to bring technology experience to anyone is a massive benefit to the community, and if you're looking for help, feel free to get in touch on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/FarsetLabs) or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/FarsetLabs) and we can help spread your project through our little province.

1. Using statements not including the words ""completely different"", and not in comparison to any other programme, what do you plan on doing?
2. It looks like this is something that's aimed at schools; so is this an outreach programme or an education programme (there is a difference) 
3. Have you spoken to W5/STEMnet, Sentinus, Young Enterprise Northern Ireland, BCS Northern Ireland, etc,? They have a great wealth of experience to draw from in these areas. You don't always have to listen to them (I didn't) but they do give a great deal of context.

I don't think you answered /u/thelazydeveloper s question at all. Basically what it sound like is you've got a PR machine rolling to wind up to a [Code.Org](http://code.org)-style 'Conference' where you'll punt out a video with the best and brightest of our celebrity world saying that 'coding is cool' and 'not just for geeks'.

Having worked in STEM outreach on the ground for years, secondary kids really aren't as afraid of coding as people think, but it's the teachers that need more support to enable THEM to run after school clubs and such.

Northern Ireland needs more young people to make a stand on things like this, *but you can't get community support without transparency*, it's better to change your mind because you were shown to be wrong *before* you make an ass of yourself.

You've got to take into account that it's freight as well that will be affected. This would free up the existing lines to carry more freight which would reduce costs for businesses and stimulate the economy. 

In all honesty, I think that this is needed but it's a project which should have happened long before now and should be close to completion (complacency was Labour's biggest cock up). The issue will continue to get worse and then there will be further impacts which would probably cost the country more in the long run. If we make small changes to existing services, the issue is probably likely to show up again in a few years time and it'll be hard to kick it into the long grass again. 

However I hope they have the foresight to not create a system which is out of date or being used inefficiently a year after construction (I imagine this is exactly what will happen).",0,1376821604,null,0,false,0,cbq692a,t3_1klig8,t1_cbq692a,t1_cbq6631,null,1429788172,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,doeboy73,null,null,"A great result. We had plenty of shots, but couldn't find the net. Aside from a couple of breaks through our defence, one from Dunne's (who is the size of 2 houses) poor pass-back to Green, Ipswich hardly had a shot at our goal.

Zamora had another very poor game. Again SWP was beating him to headers. The crowd got quite fed-up with Zamora's poor passing, lack of interception and general lack of effort - he looked very unfit and nervous. I've heard that some fans even started booing him; I didn't hear the booing and hope it's not true.

SWP looked to be playing well and kept winning the ball, he looked pretty amazing at some points with his effort and possession. Jnr Hoilett was great again, I hope his injury isn't serious. The back 4 looked to have improved, though that may have been due to the quality of the opposition. 

Rob Green took nasty abuse from Ipswich fans throughout the game, it got to be quite viscous after a while, because in 2007 he played for Norwich, their rival team, apparently. After his celebration at the end I can't imagine what it will be like when we visit their place.
Green made a great finger-tip save in the first half and generally looked most confident I've seen him, despite the abuse.

Joey Barton had another great game. He received standing ovations from X block and others, we chanted for him several times, including a new one...

So it sounds like all has been forgiven, which is true so long as he keeps putting in performances like those we've seen from him this season. Some of his passing over distance was pretty amazing.

Interestingly Clint Hill moved up into a wing position through a lot of the game, that could have been due to a lack of pressure from Ipswich.

All in all QPR looked a level above the opposition, the issue was the creativity, setting ourselves up for a goal. I also think that Zamora has become a waste of a position, we are starting games with 10.5 players at best, until he is subbed off, then we seem to score.

On top of that the $6billion figure proposed is bizarrely optimistic and basically assumes there will be no cost to buy land (because pylons!) and the technology will be dead easy to develop and build.

Don't get me wrong, the hyperloop sounds cool and I'd like to see it run somewhere, but it's an unproven technology with major drawbacks, while even 30 year old HSR tech is still difficult to get accurate cost estimates.

Thanks for the offer of getting the word out, will drop you a line later.

I'm going to address several of your points and hope that you will then see why we have chosen to keep this secretive.

1) If I went into any more detail then people would very quickly realise what the main back of this project was, and then we wouldn't have much to do at launch.

2) This is aimed primarily at school, however we're also working closely with voluntary bodies such as the WIMPS project from Public Achievement - they're fully on board and are helping us achieve what we want.

3) I'll certainly take a look into this organisations - thanks for the tip. However Thinkspace isn't just an organisation in Northern Ireland, it's quite the opposite - it's a completely global operation with Ambassadors in several countries with the aim of expanding this rapidly come launch.

4) In response to you and /u/thelazydeveloper the reason we're being so secretive is quite simply due to the way we have structured the launch, we have several massive news publications all writing articles for us on September 5th, all of our backers are going to tweet/post about us on September 5th and we just don't want to remove the fuel from launch too early. 

5) Code.org - While the 'backers' idea sounds similar to code.org, we actually started working on our video before they launched. Stephen Fry, for example was already fully on board - thought the project was in quite a different form then. While I welcome anything that aims to get young people into coding, I feel Code.org don't actually have much to offer - ultimately it's little more than a petition. We offer an actual solution and I can't wait to share it with you. - You're more than welcome to come to our launch event and ask these questions to us in person, as we're holding a Q&amp;A after the main keynote.

So he had two aides seconded to government departments... including of course the *extremely secretive and powerful* Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. My suspicion is that if Charles is interfering in the political process, its more likely to be about the provision of footbridges over streams measuring less than 1.75m in the Duchy of Cornwall than it is about more important issues.

I'm not an idealist, I appreciate that big buisness funds government and in exchange are able to lobby them over policy. People have to remember that the monarchy are effectively a corporation with huge buisness interests in the UK - this is their way of being able to lobby government. But I would be very suprised if they are using their veto in any significant way against the wishes of government - if they did the government would just ""out them"" to the public and we'd be a republic before you could say George Galloway... rather like how Labour reformed the Lords to prevent them holding up bills for decades, such as they were doing in the late 90s.

""To lead with a strong handshake may be seen as being over familiar."" - I don't think that's really true, unless your crushing the other person's hand. I do agree with the limp handshake being intolerable though - I think that gets on most of our nerves.

The stuff about which hand to hold your cutlery with is kinda BS I think - as long as you're using cutlery and not smashing spaghetti bolognese into your face with your hands we don't really give a shit whether your fork is in your left or right hand. Unless you're in a posh restaurant, then they might care.

""If you need to as where the nearest one is you will need to use the term 'cashpoint' as ATM could result in blank stares."" - We know what an ATM is -.- (might also be worth mentioning that we sometimes call them a 'hole in the wall', though I haven't heard that for a while).

""Never share your personal and/or bank details with strangers."" - is this something you often do in the States? =/

""An easy way to begin a discussion with a stranger (in a pub, queue, train, etc) is to talk about the weather. All British people have an opinion on the weather and most can tell you what the weather is due to do for the next 4/5 days."" - I think this is mainly the older generation. Yes most British tend to enjoy bitching about the weather but no most of us do not know the forecast for the next week.

I feel for you bro, they don't realise that throwing the book at normally innocent drivers doing 1mph over the limit means that people give fewer shits when they lose their jobs and have their budgets slashed - which is bad.

I remember Three to Four and Four to Five and Five to Six.

I basically didn't watch much of Seven at all. I loved the movie with Paul McGann but it had its obvious flaws and the never followed up on it.

My point I suppose is that you will come to love each new Doctor if the writing is good, so yes you will come to love Tennant as Ten. You tend to warm to Ten as as Rose adjusts to him as well.

I think you're being excessively precious, Mr. Self. The fact is, the guard had concern for the safety of a child and called it in. Better that it waste your time and 30 mins of police time to find out all is well than to do nothing. Plenty of police time is ""wasted"" following up false situations. Its their job to rule crimes out. When people do nothing, don't bother caring, don't call the police and a real crime is in process, then a far worse fate can befall a child or other victim. I'd rather have my time wasted, to be honest.

&gt;      
&gt;  * New road links, tram lines and road upgrades to cope with more pressure on infrastructure along the route   
&gt;  *  Extra tunnels and other design changes ""to buy off opposition""   
&gt;  *  Regeneration schemes around new stations as well as in towns bypassed by the line    

Oh god, the horror, the horror of it all! Not only are we finally investing in infrastructure but this investment could spawn further investment infrastructure along the route?!    

Sorry, but is this report serious? I mean, yes 80 bn, but that is 80 bn being spent exactly where we should be spending money: transport links and infrastructure. The UK hasn't seen significant internal railway upgrades since the victorian era (yes, I know, the channel tunnel and associated high speed route, but that isn't ""internal infrastructure"" since it stops almost nowhere within the UK itself).   

The fact that people are taking aircraft from one part of the UK to another part is just stupid. I mean I don't blame these people, I see the cost and time arguments, but the whole system shouldn't be so terrible that those arguments make sense.    

So absolutely bring on HS2 even if it costs £80 bn. And if we get tons of roads, trams, and associated upgrades too so much the better. This kind of investment really might be one of many answers to our housing issues, London-ification of the UK, and allow business growth.

Elon Musk's document is a very entertaining read, but the trains he proposes are completely impractical. Tiny, no disabled access, no toilets, no room for bikes or luggage, and impossible to evacuate in case of fire or breakdown (literally impossible as you're in a freaking airtight tube within an airtight tube).   

You think building someone like the HS2 is expensive with just clearing countryside and laying relatively small rails? How much do you think clearing enough land for huge tubes that have to be airtight will be? And operating pumps to reduce the atmosphere? And the relatively small number of people his system can take?    

Sorry but the Elon Musk herp derp in this thread and elsewhere is clearly by people who have read an article about an old idea (1960s) and think they're smarter than the rest of the world because they have some secret knowledge.

I've been fortunate enough not to have to deal with hospitals personally, which is good because I cannot afford insurance.  They all seem like sheep to me, just doing whatever the television tells them to do. I don't really know much about the ""Storage Wars Texas"" because I think any show based on a job or bidding on things or any ""reality TV"" is extremely pointless.

I would say you definitely picked a bad part of Texas to drive through, but to me the driving seems equally bad everywhere. Everyone is to inconsiderate to stop and think, "" Will the guy in front of me mind if I wait until the last second to stop and even then, I'm right on his ass."" I truly think the cowboy thing is more for tourism or something of that nature. That and the true rednecks who don't realize it is the 21st century. 

Food is definitely shit here. Everyone just want's sugar, fat and grease. It really worries me, people don't even care enough about there kids to make them eat a salad every now and then. That's another thing, children, people seem to have forgotten how to parent. I am somewhat glad (not proud) to be an American, but I truly wish I had been born a Brit. You came first, therefore we should follow your spelling and terminology. 

I think America has so much potential to be something great, but most people are too ignorant to even realize there is a problem.

Ok, so this probably doesn't help my argument that not all Americans are like that, but it's difficult for me to rant about this over here because people are so ""  'Merica."" My guess is that after I type this the NSA will be at my door.

As much as I may complain all Americans aren't really that bad, but it's the small things that bother me and there are a lot of them. I should be more grateful, but sometimes it's difficult.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"&gt; Surely this money would be better spent improving existing abysmal rail services

That's effectively what this is. The WCML is one of the most significant rail arteries in the country, it is projected to reach capacity within the next 10-15 years, and the necessary capacity upgrades to the existing conventional line would cost almost as much as HS2, without any advantage in travel time.

Edit: To illustrate the point, [WCML actually just finished a decade-long upgrade programme five years ago](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_Main_Line#Modernisation_by_Network_Rail), which led to ongoing delays, and cost £8-10bn to improve capacity, and increase the top speed from 110mph to 125mph. HS2 will have a top speed of 250mph. Sometimes it's really difficult to upgrade infrastructure in place. Firstly, they were having to upgrade the line while it was still being used, and secondly, there are fundamental limits on how fast you can go on a track which winds its way around the terrain (you can use tricks like tilting trains to stretch the limit, but really high speeds will never be attainable without a new, straighter route).",0,1376829698,null,0,1376837785,0,cbq777q,t3_1klig8,t1_cbq777q,t1_cbq6yui,null,1429787730,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

That's *literally* exactly what he does.  Well, first he shuffles some papers around a little bit, *then* he puts his head down and gets angry.

* Man takes exception to this, and it's implied he probably told the security guard in no unceratin terms what he thought about that... but ultimately walked off on his merry way.

* Some way down the road the police stop him and his son to question them as the security guard had alerted the police, the implication being a strange man with a young boy in tow was trying to talk his way onto campus and didn't take no for an answer (at least not at first).

* The police turn up, see there is no harm in whats going on, and fuck off to do more important stuff.

Don't get me wrong, there is a serious issue in society where men seem to be increasingly marginalised when it comes to looking after children (even their own), helped in no small part by the demonisation of men as at best *""ignorant or uncaring""* or at worst as child hungry paedophiles.

But be that as it may, the security guard had good reason to deny them access to the campus... and I wouldn't be suprised if he called them in to the police as a ""fuck you"" for trying to kick off an argument with him -- rather than as a genuine attempt to alert the police out of concern.

Your figures are rather exaggerated. A week today, [you can get London-Birmingham fares for £15 each way](http://ojp.nationalrail.co.uk/service/timesandfares/London/Birmingham/250813/1832/arr), leaving at 15:00, 17:00, 18:00 or 19:00.

The costs are pretty reasonable under a lot of circumstances, albeit not all.

Soldado: Not enough service. Looks alright, although perhaps could be helping more in build up.

Chadli: Needs to work more one twos and needs to move more off ball.

Lennon: Looks good, but a bit one dimensional, needs to work more passes into his run at his man tactic.

Gylfi: Has looked good IMO. Needs people to play more passes off him, perhaps could float around more to open some things up.

Paulinho: Has not look very good. Has had some nice moments, but not starting the play with enough creativity in the deep part of midfield.

Dembele: Excellent, as always.

Rose: Looks good. Reminds me of the cameos he made back as a youth winger. Could obviously improve, but he is yet to make a mistake. Good enough for me.

Jan: Looks excellent. Love the couple of pushes forward. Perhaps could yell at Paulinho to get things going a bit more.

The Skipper: Michael is such an excellent player. Love the long pass to Nacer. Defense has been great.

Walker: Looks very good, other than his childish responses to calls. Damn can he weight a pass.

Lloris: Looking good.

Hazard fits the billing for that role, and we have 2 strikers who can be a formidable presence in the air to receive his crosses; and 1 striker who can link up with him if he tries to cut in.  

Also, considering mikel is not good enough to provide defensive anchor alone; we will have to either play a high line or ask our midfield to drop deep. If we go full barca style, we will end up as a sieve; while asking midfield to drop deep will end up with them being underutilized. As it stands, this formation is divided in two distinct parts, and only connection is ramires. since, our midfield is not good physically, but rather technically; we need defence to be as cohesive with attack as possible. 

in short, this style has so many holes to fill. just to throw torres and lukaku on the bench and putting hazard upfront, doing this will cost us the league. ",0,1376832979,null,0,false,0,cbq7q36,t3_1kkad6,t1_cbq7q36,t1_cbpvr1j,null,1429787485,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

Fox is comical, it's quite evident to a significant number of people how it's propaganda pushed by Murdoch via a bunch of empty headed and vain cretins. The BBC is pushing government propaganda via a bunch of empty headed and vain cretins who have the majority of the public believing their output is as balanced as possible. The information put out is considered by people with intelligence and a high standard of education who genuinely and honestly want to help the public be well informed about how things are.

(Aside: I've heard that Moffat is considering depicting the Time War in future episodes. Personally, I feel strongly against this. RTD has said that the writers then purposefully did not depict this event due to the fact that they cannot do it enough justice. Hands off, Moffat!) It is clearly evident in Season 1 that something is bothering Nine tremendously, especially in comparison to the comparatively more light-hearted Ten and Eleven incarnations, and Rose is the one who helps him through this time. Her role in restoring the Doctor's humanity is arguable the reason the Doctor is still around now. In Journey's End, as Ten is leaving Rose in the parallel universe with the MetaCrisisTen (shameless hinting at username haha), he reminds Rose how important he was for her, and how she must sacrifice her wants, the real Doctor, for what she has to do, save the MetaCrisis Ten, for he needs her more than she wants the Doctor. It's heart-breaking to think that on some level, Rose eventually got her Doctor (as she helped him heal and become Ten later on), but the Doctor never got his Rose.

Apparently we are leading the league in shots, which is nice. *Some* of them have to hit the target.

Just over a week to go to bring in cover/replacement for Zamora. Maybe he will be more useful as a striker you bring on deep into the game, when the defenders are tired and won't offer as much physical resistance. Guys behind me were moaning about him all game.

I almost missed the goal because I was sure the ball was going out for a goal kick, before SWP sped onto it and fed it to Austin. Whether through Hoilett or SWP, our pace option is a valuable weapon for us getting the ball forward right now. Long may it continue. SWP also set up Austin for that crossbar shot.

Military dictatorships exist everywhere, but there is no such thing as a naval dictatorship. What English people of nearly all classes loathe from the bottom of their hearts is the swaggering officer type, the jingle of spurs and the crash of boots.

The correct answer is ""there should be everything"", other wise we end up in the 80's action movie tyranny or the modern video games one where every man/woman must be a ""powerful"" character instead of being whatever they want/need to be.

Fujita with recognising this first in 1973. Actual quote - ""When land areas are taken into account, the United Kingdom actually has the highest frequency of reported tornadoes per unit area in the world."".

Some doubts are raised about this claim [here](https://mathscinotes.wordpress.com/2013/05/28/tornado-frequency-math/). The conclusion there - ""I do see that Britain has a higher rate of tornadoes per unit area per year than the US. While Britain does have the most tornadoes per year in Europe, its rate per unit area is not the highest in Europe (at least for the data I found). The relatively low tornado rate per unit area per year of the US makes sense now that I think about it because most of the US only rarely sees tornadoes. Since the US is a big country, the average rate is low. Our Midwestern states do have high tornado rates. However, the Netherlands still beats them all."".

Depends how you're defining feminism. For example, if your only exposure to it had been the SRS subreddit, you could be forgiven for thinking that all feminists are man-hating, Andrea Dworkin-worshipping psychopaths. You'd be very unlikely to meet such a person in the real world, however, because they are very much keyboard warriors. Most feminists I know (and I'd consider myself one) fall more within the bracket of egalitarianism. Some of my feminist friends are equally as passionate about, for example, correcting the bias against fathers in child custody cases.

&gt;When I can put on a bikini, turn on a webcam and make a fortune exploiting lonely men I might think we have equal rights.

That...has absolutely sod all to do with equal rights, unless you think equal rights should extend to forcing people into redefining what they are or aren't attracted to.

Having said that, I thought the boys did a damn good job of finding what little space there was, and getting some really nice shots off to challenge their keeper. It is also quite obvious to me that Rose on the left now allows us to push our wing backs forward more, allowing for even more attackers, while both still have incredible pace to get back in defense.

If you think back over the game, I'm pretty sure you can find at least one moment (and more likely 2 or more) where you thought ""fuck that was awesome"" about each and every player on the team.

Everything from Danny Rose getting back to make the tackle, to Soldado linking up well with Lennon, Defoe holding up the ball, Siggy's amazing shot on the turn.

Capoue is a fucking beast. I'm not sure if he and Sandro could play together they could potentially kill opposition players. Throw Paulinho or Dembele into that mix and you essentially have enough firepower to invade poland.

Lennon was a bit off again, but honestly I think it's because he has never really had a decent honest to goodness no 9 to aim at and work with. Sure, his crossing and decisions are poor at times, but the fact of the matter is the guy gets into a position to cross well so frequently that he will eventually get it right. It's less about the finesse and more about brute-forcing the right cross by doing it so many times. I honestly expect he can improve in this squad and take it up a level.

LLoris was fucking on his game. One minor mistake on a corner I think. The rest of the game he killed every attack and long ball into the box, and fucking owned Phillips with that tackle.

Finally and most importantly, how fucking well did Crystal Palace play? I saw a few people in the match thread giving off about how its ""only"" Crystal Palace and we should be walking it. Fuck that. Sure they are just up and likely to get relegated, but man they played their fucking hearts out. They did everything right, they honestly punched well above their weight in this game and were massively massively up for it, every inch of their ground was. Their substitution was like something from Football Manager, but it nearly fucking paid off. I don't think anyone could claim Palace played a poor game, it was near enough flawless.

Soldado had a decent game, but lacked a lot of service. Chadli got better as the game went on, though once he did get going he looked dangerous on occasion. Paulinho and Capoue seemed decent without being flashy. I'll reserve judgement on them for when I've watched a bit more.

Lennon was a bit disappointing. Too much hesitation on crosses, not the type of play I expected from him. Siggy had a great shot at the end of the first half, he had a better game than Lennon.

Yep. And some (most) aren't.

&gt;Actually it has a lot to do with equal rights. There are perks to being female and being able to use your body to exploit lonely men is one of them.

Again, this is *nothing* to do with equal rights. It's up to the individual - if a lonely man (or woman) wants to pay to watch someone strip on a webcam then that's entirely up to them. If there's a market for it then people will do it. Are you seriously suggesting that the fact that there are fewer male cam strippers than female is an equal rights issue?

&gt; There are plenty of women who make a living just being attractive in a way that is way harder for men to do.

Look, last time I checked there was no shortage of male models. Ever read Men's Health magazine? You think the boybands that win the X Factor are chosen primarily for their singing abilities?

&gt; There are pros and cons on both sides of the fence and if you want to ignore the pros of being female, why should we listen to the cons?

true,LordMugwort,flair6,,"Lloris- Kept the clean sheet for us. So quick off his line. In my opinion the best keeper in the Premier League.

Walker- Great attacking threat and solid defensively. No problems here. looks set to have a big season for us. Maybe needs to stop chewing the ref out so much and just purely concentrate on his game.

Dawson- Looked vulnerable once or twice but is a very steady influence at the back. He'll never let us down though probably not 1st choice when Kaboul is fully fit.

SuperJan- For a man who's not 100% it didn't show at all. Glad to have him back and he's a future captain in the making.

Rose- I've been one of his biggest critics so far but if he continues on like today then i will happily eat a slice of humble pie and ask for seconds. Solid defensive outing and linked up well going forward. He'll be up against better players this season but this was promising.

Paulinho- Played deeper than he will when Sandro is fit or Capoue has more time to gel. Always available to recieve the ball. Tidy in possession. Didn't see much of him getting forward but we will. Solid debut.

Dembele- Great on the ball as usual. Solid if unspectacular display. Will have better games when we're up to strength. Feel he was subbed off with half an eye on midweek game.

Siggy- Some nice touches but again looks like more time to gel with the new signings will do him good. Blistering shot on him. Perhaps needs a little more guile to his game.

Lennon- STILL has a poor end product to his game. Had me tearing my hair out at times. He'll have better games this season but i'd really like Townsend to put pressure on him for his place. Might shake him up a bit.

Chadli- Looks tasty. Linked well with Siggy/Rose. Looks like he wants to score. Maybe could have laid the ball off a couple of time rather than taking his man on but that'll come with time. Impressed the hell out of me. Wants to make it happen.

Goaldado- Worked his socks off but was largely starved of service. He's only been in a couple of weeks so the understanding of what he wants will come. Great positioning in the box. Looks like he'll sniff out quite a few goals for us this year. Cool as a cucumber for the pen. Paying back that transfer fee already. Love him.

Capoue- Very impressive. Played like he wants to start every game. Quick to the ball. Great tackle on him. Looked promising getting the ball and himself forward. More please!

Defoe- Late sub but showed why we will need him this season. Looks as strong as i've ever seen him and will shoot any chance he gets. Even managed to go wide instead of direct at one point. Go on Jermaine!

Kaboom- To late to rate. Just good to see him get some minutes after a year out. Hopefully 100% soon and he can be the player he was before injury.
