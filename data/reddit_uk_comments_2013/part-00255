true,HPB,eng-durham,Durham,"&gt;Where do you think they got those values in the first place, they weren't born in a vacuum. And large proportions of those people were Christians.

Christianity is 2000 years old. Are you seriously claiming that values of  individualism, freedom of expression, tolerance, brotherhood of mankind were invented by Christians and didn't exist beforehand ?

And I'm puzzled as to how you can say that liberal values include 

&gt;individualism, freedom of expression, tolerance, brotherhood of mankind

but 

&gt;not necessarily gay sex

Religion can take credit for some liberal values but someone else has to claim the liberal values which religion disapproves of ? 

Perhaps it had bugger all to do with religion in the first place and religion is merely attempting to take credit to prove it is somehow still relevant to modern life ?

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;You cannot prove that through;

International relations 101. Sovereign nations don't inherit memberships of organizations, until they are sovereign. They have no legal status. This is basic international law. You need to go away and study the concept of Sovereignty and what it means.  

It's like arguing that a fetus should getting a passport. The fetus may be a person in X months, but it pops out and starts yelling it has no legal status as a person - it can't have a passport. 

The EU cannot negotiate with a Scottish Government as Sovereign because it doesn't exist. It has to talk through UK treaty structures. 

When the Scottish gov then becomes independent, it can then treated is as a sovereign nation. At that point Scotland is a NEW country. It doesn't INHERIT the old UK treaty obligations because it didn't sign them - the UK did. The UK is still around, it doesn't give up it's treaty rights. 

This means from that point on , LEGALLY, the Scots are basically in the same place as the Turks and the Moldovans who want to join. 

All of the above are facts in international law. 

To accede the Scots then have apply to the EU accession process and fulfill the ACQUIS criteria. Just like any other country outside the EU would have to if they wanted to join.   

After this the political shenanigans start. 

Why are you even arguing with me when you don't understand the ACQUIS conditions and the basic treaty obligations prevalent under international law?

&gt;As I've said about 4 times - it wasn't a currency union.

Look at the definition of the currency union. This article is linked to in the first sentence of the Scandinavian Monetary Union

&gt;There are three types of currency unions:

&gt; Informal – unilateral adoption of foreign currency

&gt; Formal – adoption of foreign currency by virtue of bilateral or multilateral agreement with the issuing authority, sometimes supplemented by issue of local currency in currency peg regime

&gt;Formal with common policy – establishment by multiple countries of common monetary policy and issuing authority for their common currency

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_union

Further details wrt to the Scandinavian **Monetary Union** (really, the clue is in the name) can be found in section 2.1.2 of the following

&gt;Look, there are plenty of reasons why the Scots should think about seperation - but the experiences of the Kingdom of Sweden and Norway at the end of the 19th Century really aren't one of them.

Strawman, I never said anything of the sort. 

&gt;There is literally nothing to be learnt from it, although I know left wing Scots have this tendency to see everything Scandinavian as a panacea for all their problems.

Nordic countries perform significantly better than the UK (and in particular Scotland) on counts of health, education, life expectancy and wealth inequality. These are the important things in life.

A key point is UBS and Goldman both had extra information compared to J.P. Morgan, Deutsche and Citi. Basically, the latter 3 did their initial valuations in around April with far less information than UBS and Goldman about the company compared to when the £3.3bn sale occurred. 

Moreover, market conditions at the time of the IPO were not great due to the possibility of a US default. In addition, there was the threat of strike action.  

Another possibility could be the government intentionally chose the lower valuation due to fear of the IPO failing (it could if the price was too high).

And, finally, Nasri is on fire, he is playing even better than his Arsenal peak, IMO.

Pretty sure I forgot about something important.

Thirdly, to your point re: what we would be like with Bale. My counter to that is could you honestly say we have anyone comparable to Bale in the team right now? We lost our best player who was being compared to Ronaldo. To expect us to seamlessly continue without a drop in quality would be absurd.

Our team is young and full of potential, so in my eyes at least, a poor run of form is something that can be expected. Call it, soccers form of teething.

again I apologize for coming off as a dick but the frustration with fans calling for AVB to be fired just seems asinine to me.

I do appreciate that ""not a love interest"" style of relationship between the companion and the Doctor, but the *possible love interest/dollops of sexual tension* was something new to the series. I'm sure there was pressure to write from a new angle, and one of the most popular when the series is around a male and female lead character who are ""supposed"" to be platonic, (see: Moonlighting, Cheers, Scarecrow and Mrs. King, Lois &amp; Clark, etc). So they had to milk it in order to attract a younger generation of viewers.

Luckily, in our series, it's written in such a way that each relationship between Doctor and companion is different. The series has not blown up from him getting together with someone because there continues to be a variety of people involved in his life.

true,BitcoinJobe,,IBWT.co.uk - UK Exchange,"Good replies you had there.

Just to add, from an Exchange's PoV (for the UK), here's some additional tax information.

As people often ask me about IBWT (how do you pay VAT? Do you add VAT onto the bitcoins on the platform? etc, etc).


Q. How do you (an exchange) pay VAT?

A. An exchange pays VAT on the service fee it charges.

Example. An exchange that charges 0.6% fee would have to pay 20% of that as VAT.


Q. Do you add VAT onto the Bitcoins for 'sale' on your platform?

A. No. When people use an exchange, they sell/trade their coins at their own choice of value.

Defined. UK Customers/traders who earn xxxx money/profit from trading/selling bitcoins on any Exchanges are still liable to CGT (Capital Gains Tax). Please see the excellent answers provided by the OP.

Clarifications - IF you buy/trade/acquire Bitcoins/Litecoins, and then SPEND as Btc/Ltc (even though you maybe brought as £1,000 and now worth £100,000). IF you keep your coins AS coins, then these are not taxable.

It is generally a good idea, that once you get Bitcoins, you spend them as Bitcoins. Understandably not possible for everything in the UK, yet.

There is one angle I'm concerned about, hopefully someone can clear it up. In case of Scottish independence, would all Scots have to give up British citizenship or would the UK allow them to keep it alongside Scottish citizenship?

Because in that case the EU is getting the worst of all possible deals -freedom of movement without free trade-. Millions of Scots could move to EU countries without any restrictions.

[The Next Seven Days] (https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6847633/1/The-Next-Seven-Days).  (31k words)

**Summary:** Arthur is told a series of events that will occur over the space of a week. The seventh day will end with magic returning to Camelot, ushered in by the warlock Emrys, either to save the kingdom or destroy it. Arthur has a plan, though. Sort of.

**Spoilers:** I think you should be fine if you've seen through season 3, maybe 4...

 [Crossing the Line] (https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6756959/1/Crossing-the-Line) (4.5K words)

**Summary:** In which Merlin is bludgeoned, strangled, attacked, smothered, shot with glass, and tossed out a window, burned, whipped, stabbed, thrown down stairs, nearly drowned on dry land, and harpooned, and still manages to save Camelot from seven evil sorcerers.

**Spoilers:** Once again, through season 3ish.
--&gt; Side note: This one is sillier rather than angsty, I promise!


In case you're looking for slash, here's a really long story by Queen Megara with gradual development that I thought was pretty well done:

[All The King's Horses and All The King's Men] (https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6958947/1/All-The-King-s-Horses-And-All-The-King-s-Men) (147K words)

**Summary:** King Arthur and Queen Guinevere are loved by the people, The Knights of The Round Table are becoming legends, and the king's manservant is stumbling his way through Camelot as always. The King is on his throne and all is well. Until the rumours start ... 

**Spoilers:** Everything up to and including Season 3, set after season 3. Once again, eventual slash (but there was actually only one explicit chapter and it's clearly stated at the top that it's totally skippable, if you're not interested in that sort of thing).

One more!  This one is from OneDarkandStormyNight:

[Just Before the Dawn, aka The Moment] (https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7857556/1/Just-Before-the-Dawn-aka-The-Moment) (17.5K words)

**Summary:** Merlin has dreamed of this moment since he discovered his destiny. As Camelot is once again on the verge of falling, he has no choice but to reveal what he is to Arthur...no matter if either of them is prepared to face the reality of it.

**Spoilers:** Up to and including Season 4.

&gt;**Liverpool ready to make January transfer move for Chelsea defender Ryan Bertrand**

&gt;*With José Enrique ruled out until February and a determination to finish in the top four, Liverpool are set to make a transfer window move for Ryan Bertrand.*

&gt;Brendan Rodgers is ready to make a renewed bid to sign Ryan Bertrand, the Chelsea defender, in January.

&gt;The Liverpool manager will target the England international for a ­second time this season when the transfer window reopens, with a new left-back a priority at Anfield after José Enrique’s knee injury.

&gt;Enrique is expected to be unavailable until February after surgery to cure a persistent knee problem and Bertrand is likely to figure highly on Rodgers’s list of potential replacements.

&gt;Chelsea rejected an approach from Liverpool for the defender in July, with the 24-year-old setting his sights on increased first-team opportunities at Stamford Bridge.

&gt;But he has struggled to force his way into the team despite Ashley Cole’s rib injury, with Jose Mourinho opting to move César Azpilicueta across to the left flank.

&gt;Bertrand is settled at Chelsea but Rodgers will offer him regular football as he is believed to have reservations over Aly Cissokho, while Jon Flanagan made only his second start of the season in last weekend’s Merseyside derby.

&gt;Sunderland and Cardiff also have a long-standing interest in Bertrand and could pursue a loan deal, but Rodgers knows him well from his time in charge of Chelsea’s reserves and Liverpool appear genuine contenders for a top-four place.

&gt;Liverpool could face difficulties over the potential transfer fee, however, as bad blood still exists between the two clubs over the sale of Daniel Sturridge in January this year.

&gt;Chelsea could demand around £8 million for the defender, who signed a five-year contract worth £35,000 a week in September.

&gt;But Rodgers will be backed by the Liverpool board in January as he bids to end the club’s long exile from the Champions League and is searching for players who will immediately challenge for a first-team place.

&gt;Meanwhile, Chelsea will receive the scan results on Thursday on the muscle injury suffered by Samuel Eto'o during the Champions League defeat against Basle on Tuesday.

&gt;If he is sidelined for a lengthy period, it will test Chelsea’s attacking options.

&gt;Fernando Torres has been troubled by a groin problem, Demba Ba has become an increasingly peripheral figure while Romelu Lukaku is on a season-long loan at Everton.

&gt;Chelsea face nine matches in December – with Mourinho suggesting that it will be a defining month in the season – beginning with the Premier League home game against Southampton on Sunday, which makes Torres’s return all the more vital, although there will be concerns he is not fully fit.

&gt;There are, therefore, increasing suggestions that Chelsea will dip into the transfer market in January to bring in another striker with sources in Portugal claiming on Wednesday that they had made a move for Porto’s Colombian forward Jackson Martínez.

&gt;The 27-year-old is highly rated and several clubs made tentative offers in the summer.",0,1385595230,null,0,false,0,cdojgj6,t3_1rltto,t1_cdojgj6,t3_1rltto,null,1428481946,17,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,17

Some fans including myself would rather see Mata leave and succeed with another team than be paid to sit on the bench for the rest of the Season. If Mata is the last pick in our squad for the positions we have, he's not going to be playing for us in vital games, and probably not even in lesser games, so why exactly do we have him?

Do you think it's acceptable that our POTY for 2 seasons rots away on the bench when we are lacking a creative midfielder? It's not right. Every one of those fans that has said it are supporting Mata and Chelsea FC, because we'd love him to play, and we want the club to succeed more than ever, but if he's going to rarely play for us, why keep him?

I'll be honest, when he first joined Chelsea, I wasn't a great fan of his, but the more he played, the more you realise how important he is as a player to any team he plays for. It's like Juventus not using Pirlo, if it happened, you can bet there would be riots.

It's borderline selfish to keep a player that isn't going to be playing.

Oh, I agree. German reunification added 16 million new EU citizens overnight, from a country which had no prior relationship with the EU.

Scottish independence will ensure 5 million EU citizens remain within the EU, from a country whose legal system is already in concordance with EU law and which is already deeply interlinked into other EU countries (be it through freedom of movement, the common market, or EU funding).

In the eighth Doctor books (spoilers) there's an interesting sequence where the time lords get involved in a serious time war. They start playing dirty tricks like travelling into the future to get advanced weapons, they use guns that see into the future and aim at the point that the target will be at when the projectile arrives, they start modifying themselves and becoming more and more dedicated to total war. After several millenia of this sort of thing, they discover the planet that the enemy originated from and travel back in time to destroy it. The catch is that by this point they've forgotten that they are time lords and what gallifrey used to be like, so the planet that they're trying to wipe out is actually gallifrey in the present day.

true,BitcoinJobe,,IBWT.co.uk - UK Exchange,"Nope, it was just as assumption from certain people posting about HMRC.

HMRC have been telling people who have made a profit (via localbitcoins or otherwise) that they owe tax if they've made a profit (CGT). However, this is very normal for any profit making regardless of what was used to make the profit. There's been a bit of confusion spread around unfortunately. 

It was assumed by some people that it was to be considered as 'vouchers, because they (the Bitcoin sellers) thought they had to ADD on 20% onto their Bitcoin sales so they can afford to pay their tax.

This is wrong.

IF someone has made xxx profit, then they should pay tax accordingly. However, they are taxed on their profit (if you've made £79,000+, then you should pay tax).

Bitcoins themselves are exempt under current laws and regulations (and to be absolutely honest, I believe they will always be exempt (in 'adding' vat) because of the way they were created/exist).

For exact details please check;

Debatable, but clearly everyone thinks that Lampard is shit all of the sudden.

De Bruyne is overrated as hell. There is a reason why he does not start. If he was good enough, he would have started. Look at Oscar. Look at Schurrle. Look at Eto'o, every single one of them have stepped up and proven there worth to start. De Bruyne is talented, but has proven dick all. There is no reason for him to start.

The President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso. He has said that Scotland would need to negotiate entry with all 28 member states and would not be granted automatic entry in a recent report - note an official report, not a personal opinion. 

Further Salmond had 'legal advice' stating that Scotland would be allowed to be grandfathered in, which has been found out to be a lie. The SNP went to courts to try and impose an injunction on this information getting out.

Many EU member states have made it clear they will veto Scotland's entry into the EU 

&gt; The referendum does not create independence overnight.

I never said that in my post, don't put words in my mouth. They've set a date already of 24th of March, 2016 for secession from the Union. 

At that point we cease to be part of the UK and would become an independent nation. There's no way they can get a deal in less than 18 months agreed across the board, and we will need to find a currency fast because we can't use the Pound or the Euro lawfully once we secede. 

Without a currency to pay anyone, it would mean instantly at 00:01 March 24th, 2016, we would owe over £1.6 trillion due to defaulting on the Scottish portion of UK debt The oilfields won't fund the nation because they've been losing money for 20 of the last 21 years (figures which the SNP have fought tooth and nail to avoid revealing) and we would continue to be in deficit in terms of public services as we spend more on them than we collect in taxes.

Mitterrand was concerned with the pace once it became inevitable, Thatcher was quite open in her opposition.

&gt; Spain is concerned with the precedence this will set. It makes no difference that Scotland has existing EU laws and values.. the technical issues are irrelevant because essentially Spain has a moral objection to the idea because of what it means for their own country. When they have a veto that is clearly going to be a major difficulty.

Well, maybe. On the other hand the purpose of the EU project is to help European countries work together - enlargement is a long-standing goal, and given Scotland's historical membership and future commitments it seems extremely unlikely that there will be widespread opposition.

I think the most likely scenario is that Spain will stamp its feet, however a deal will be made along the lines of the UK being a state formed of constituent nations rather than a unitary nation-state.

There will be some hand-waving over why that allows for enlargement without accession, Scotland will be transitioned from its current status, and Spain will have an agreement that allows them to describe Catalonia as a ""region"" rather than a ""country"" and hence be ineligible.",0,1385598559,null,0,false,0,cdoko3n,t3_1rlhwm,t1_cdoko3n,t1_cdokdc9,null,1428481335,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

They did, but they didn't know he'd reached it. Hell, I don't even think Eleven knows he's reached it yet. You're assuming two things here:

1. The Silence knew about the MetaCrisis Doctor, and that he counts as a regeneration.  I'm not sure the Doctor himself realises this yet.

2. The Silence knew about Hurt Doctor. We already know the Cybermen didn't know about him, and neither did the Atraxi. Why would the Silence?

&gt;why would it work this time and not the first?

Maybe because this time they know he's had his last regeneration, which they didn't previously? It's actually pretty easy to kill a Time Lord who can't regenerate, once you realise that fact.

&gt;There are other times we see Smith deal with regeneration, though.

I agree, and it's difficult to fit this to what we've seen, but I can only assume he didn't realise that MetaCrisis counted. You're jumping the gun on this one though, as it will almost certainly be explained in the Christmas special.

&gt;what about the regeneration energy he used on River in The Angels Take Manhattan? Why does he have that if he can't regenerate?

He was previously given regeneration energy by River. It could easily be argued that this energy was more than he needed to heal himself, but not enough for a full regen. He therefor felt no problem with giving her back what he had to spare.

It's Doctor Who.

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; The President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso. He has said that Scotland would need to negotiate entry with all 28 member states and would not be granted automatic entry in a recent report - note an official report, not a personal opinion.

Do you have a link to this report?

&gt; Further Salmond had 'legal advice' stating that Scotland would be allowed to be grandfathered in, which has been found out to be a lie. The SNP went to courts to try and impose an injunction on this information getting out.

While I don't have any particular sympathy for how Salmond handled himself there (I believe he answered ""Do you have legal advice?"" with ""Yes, in terms of the debate""), his argument was with respect to the Scottish ministerial code (which is meant to ensure that legal advice offered to ministers remains confidential; he was [cleared of breaking it](http://www.holyrood.com/2013/01/fm-cleared-over-eu-advice-but-questions-raised-over-ministerial-code-clarity/) however personally I see no reason for the rule).

That aside, Salmond's political career is hardly the purpose of independence - this is about a decision for the next hundred years, not a politician who will retire within a decade.

&gt; Many EU member states have made it clear they will veto Scotland's entry into the EU

Many states?

&gt; They've set a date already of 24th of March, 2016 for secession from the Union. At that point we cease to be part of the UK and would become an independent nation.

Well, the current Scottish government has proposed a date. The exact date will depend on the negotiations with the UK government.

&gt; There's no way they can get a deal in less than 18 months agreed across the board

Most of the time for in EU membership applications is taken by reviewing national legislation and harmonising it with EU legislation. Scots law has already undergone that process as part of the UK (EU legislation is transposed into both Scottish and English law when implemented by the UK).

German reunification took 10 months, and this added 16 million people from a country with no prior relationship to the EU. I think it's reasonable to expect that a smaller country that's already ""EU compatible"" could happen in a similar timeframe.

Which is clearly true - if Scotland becomes an independent country then it's entirely possible that the UK may decide to withdraw the ability to have dual-citizenship from Scots while keeping it open to other countries.

But at present the [UKBA says](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/britishcitizenship/dualnationality/) ""You will not normally lose your British nationality if you become a citizen or national of another country"".

Similarly, the Scottish Government's [white paper says](http://www.scotreferendum.com/questions/i-still-have-a-number-of-years-left-of-my-uk-passport-can-i-keep-it-would-i-be-able-to-renew-my-uk-passport/) ""the Scottish Government intends to allow dual nationality and would not place any obstacles in the way of individuals holding a Scottish passport alongside a UK passport"".

There are currently around 800K Scots living in England, and 450K English people living in Scotland, so I think it's unlikely that either of those positions would change.

Similar dire predictions about the future have included the threat that [England might have to bomb Scottish airports](http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/political-news/english-would-bomb-our-airports.17005697) in the event of independence.

This is undeniably a shoddy recolorization of a black and white shoot.  Now, it IS likely that the shoot itself is official Doctor Who stuff, but certainly not this version.  Why do I say this?  Aside from the general weird-looking colors, there are some things that are obviously wrong.  For one, look at Jenna's neck.  The sides of her neck (and part of her hair) is completely grayscale.  Also, her irises are red for Christ's sake.  Only part of Capaldi's eye was colored in, so it looks half-orange/half-cyan.  And of course, he looks like Beaker because who ever did this *made his side hair the same color as his skin*.

So if this is from an actual Doctor Who shoot, what does this mean (other than Capaldi and Coleman didn't become interdimensional abominations)?  All we can really tell is that Capaldi's suit is dark, but we have no idea what color it actually is.  It also seems that the phrase ""It's all in here"" is important to Series 8 and that the story arc will probably have something to do with imagination/hallucination/dreaming or something of that sort.

EDIT: I did some ""reverse-Photoshopping"" (removing color and undoing the changes in luminance from the colors) and I think this is what the original photos looked like (*if* this was an official shoot in the first place, and there is evidence that the actors were just pasted onto a fake background (there are traces of the brush tool used to color the black background)).

Yeah, Azpi did a good job... But does he have the same amount of pressure on him as Mata? Is he a player that has been responsible for carrying the whole team? Is he a player the entire team relies on? Moreover, has Mata really been THAT disappointing? Someone here posted stats about how he has still managed to create chances despite being ""shit"". And if you REALLY think that a player should perform magic off the bench then you have obviously never played the game.

Kalou... Just Lol. 

&gt; Debatable, but clearly everyone thinks that Lampard is shit all of the sudden.
De Bruyne is overrated as hell. There is a reason why he does not start. If he was good enough, he would have started. Look at Oscar. Look at Schurrle. Look at Eto'o, every single one of them have stepped up and proven there worth to start. De Bruyne is talented, but has proven dick all. There is no reason for him to start.
Internationals are different then the cup, to make that comparison is ridiculous. Go back to watching the god damn dallas cowboys, you clearly know dick all about football.

Yeah, nobody has said Lampard is shit, just that he doesn't deserve to start every game or more than the other DMs we've got. 

De Bruyne is overrated as hell? You formed this judgement based on what? 3 games? Look at Schurrle? What am I looking at? He's been on the bench for the last 2 games.

Your presumptions are spectacularly wrong. Internationals are different 'than' (yes, its than, not then) the cup? So playing well for Internationals is irrelevant?

The IBWT team fully understand and accept that sending hard currency via mail is a daunting prospect. Though personally I would like to remind how (for most) it is a daunting prospect to understand/accept Bitcoin and convert fiat to Btc.

The UK banks (as you may or may not be aware) are putting up severe road blocks for UK Bitcoiners (new and old), the IBWT model plans to beat the banks by ignoring them.

We also fully understand and accept that postal orders, or sending hard currency by mail is not for everyone, and we fully promote alternative means for UK Bitcoiners to acquire Bitcoins.

We are also in the process of talks and creating additional alternative methods of funding (that will not be subject to bank closures nor transaction freezes).

One thing that I'm personally interested in is funding via mobile phones (deposits and withdrawals), and also by email. Though both do not have fully viable 3rd party businesses in the UK, yet. It is hopeful that money innovation will continue and better, technologically advanced, methods of deposits/withdrawal will become available asap.

(The mobile phone funding seems more likely at the moment, but probably not until 2014).

We will also be looking into alternative parcel/mail services than Royal Mail, though happy enough to start this model with Royal Mail. If banking clampdowns occur more wildly in the UK as Bitcoin adoption increases it is likely that this type of model will be adopted by more exchanges.

This model has also enabled us to vastly lower verification criteria - https://ibwt.co.uk/en/company/verification

edit: there is 0 verification for trading btc/ltc - https://ibwt.co.uk/en/ex/x/btc_ltc

p.s. once IBWT gains enough traders/interest then I suggest observing - https://btc-e.com/exchange/ltc_btc - whilst observing the ibwt btc &gt; ltc. Arbitrage opportunities ;)

Did my weekly shop... 30 quid's worth of shopping, and for the first time ever, I opted to go through the self checkout with the conveyor belt.  I've only ever used the smaller ones for a couple of items here and there but I thought ""What the hell, I have the time to put all my shit up here and then scan it through""

So I scanned it all through and bagged it the way I liked it, with my last item to get scanned being a DVD.  They need an assistant to be put through (security tags, age ratings etc), so I scan it and wait... and wait... and wait... and wave my arms at the assistant doing nothing.  In the time it's taken her to get to my self service, it has asked if I wanted to continue.  I hit yes and it completely lost it's shit... ""Unexpected item in baggage area"" etc when I hadn't even touched them, and the woman couldn't use her log in to void that, so, they had to reset the system.  MEANING, I had to get all my shit re-scanned... which took for-fucking-ever.

What annoys me is that all that could have been avoided if she'd done her fucking job and looked for anyone needing assistance instead of making me stand there like a spare prick.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"It strikes me that the Scottish post-yes bargaining position will actually be deceptively weak. As much as they may want a majority share of oil, a minority share of national debt and Trident off the Clyde they will actually be very unlikely to achieve all or even any of those things to the extent the recent white paper suggests. 

I'm bemused as to how Scots voters expect a fledgling Scottish government, with no experience in this kind of international diplomacy, to somehow negotiate a preferential settlement. The UK on the other hand has one of the most well established and entrenched diplomatic organizations of any nation.   

For those that don't follow what I mean - here is a crude example; when Alex Salmond wants Trident off the Clyde he has to try and offer some sort of incentive for the rUK to accommodate that wish. When the situation is reversed and the rUK wants Trident to remain on the Clyde, they already have the contacts and diplomatic apparatus to access other organizations like the EU, NATO, the USA etc. to apply international pressure on Salmond to acquiesce to the British position. Such pressure could include things like membership of the EU/Euro/'Sterling Zone'. It is very easy for David Cameron to get on the phone to people like Barrack Obama and lobby directly on an established relationship than it is for someone like Salmond to parley with other leaders who will probably be wary of what Scottish independence will mean to them domestically. But not just at the top - but at every level. For example the British army liaisons who already work at the Pentagon due to the extent of co-operation between the US dept. of defence and British MoD can lobby the hugely influential US defense sector to support British interests (like maintaining Trident on the Clyde in the short-mid term). It's a level of access the new Scottish government just won't have. They'll find they have a lot to say - but not many people who really want to listen.

I don't mean it to sound like the Scots can't achieve independence, but just to point out they should vote for it with their eyes open that they aren't going to come out of negotiations on top since they have relatively little to offer and some of their aspirations run contrary to the interests of several very large and powerful nations/organizations. While I've no doubt the Scots could achieve and sustain independence I suspect there could very well be a period of ""hurt"" in the short term, while they walk away from the UK feeling somewhat asset stripped for very little in return - asking whether things like getting Trident off the Clyde were actually really worth the price they paid for them.

Really boring, I know. But our back four is pretty easy in my eyes, maybe give Chiriches a go, whatever.  

Sandro and Mousa were the best CM pairing in the Prem last year while healthy, let's get back to that.  

Lamela will be our best option on the right wing by January.  In my opinion, he already is.  Townsend on the left, because we need a proper winger in there somewhere, and he's our best option, in my opinion.

With a proper winger, and a healthy Eriksen, I think Bobby Soldier remembers where the net is.

The wording was ""...**such as** her genuine remorse, and the fact she was now a young mother"", from the article I linked to in the previous posts. The other factors would likely be the ones indicated in the sentencing guidlines I linked to, which would seem to include her quick retraction, the amount of time she had already waited for trial unnecesserily and her full admission of guilt. The remorse, addressed below in the comments with Son_of_Plug, is obviously a judgement call by the judge - they're involved with the cases to a vastly greater extent than you or me, so they're given the power to make those judgement calls. I'm not saying this one was necessarily right or that the amount of room judges are given is the right amount, because I don't know enough about the judicial system, but the current mandatoy sentencing laws in America are performing poorly enough to indicate that they need some discretion. 

Additionally, I'm not here to argue about whether or not the level of reduction in the sentence due to her having become a mother is warrented, but the idea isn't to relieve the person of punishment because they've become a parent, it's to recognise that the child's need for a parent should be taken into account alongside the desire to punish the person with prison.",0,1385603952,null,0,false,0,cdomljq,t3_1rfc95,t1_cdomljq,t1_cdms2h5,null,1428480424,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1

Of course, he hasn't ever played as well as he has so far, but for me 50 is only really a possibility if everything goes right, and that very rarely happens.

It could be 5 minutes or more before they actually arrive there.  My take was that the Great Intelligence's conversation with Strax, et al occurs as Clara and the Doctor are in transit through the catacombs.  Do they have to show 15 minutes of on screen time for you to believe that they walked for 15 minutes before arriving?  Because the TARDIS can time travel, despite the length of time it took Clara to tell the Doctor where Strax et al were, he can still arrive ""before"" that point and arrive just in the nick of time as he did in the episode.

It's a huge alteration of everything the new who is and was, because the Doctor is who he is and acts how he acts because of that decision. If it never happened at all then what was the point of the last 8 years of the show and the character that developed out of it? He did the same thing to Amy and Rory, and River as well. None of them ever had to face the consequences of their actions and the character became one dimensional and far less likable then what they could have been. And Moffat did another one of his awful writing habits with the 50th of not ending his plot line. The Face of Boe, Jenny, River Song, the ending of the 5th and 7th seasons all never got a proper ending, mostly because i don't think Moffat knows how to end a damn story.

The [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1rm09p/amazing_value_of_the_bbc/cdoqpig) ""Excellent answer"" - a ""me too"" comment if ever there was one and thus a poor quality comment by any rational standard, get's 10 upvotes simply because it's agreeing with the groupthink?

Anyone questioning how the BBC is funded, doing so in a calm, polite, and logical manner, is getting downvoted to hell.

Upvotes and downvotes are not supposed to be a way to enforce groupthink, you're supposed to upvote or downvote based on comment quality regardless of whether you agree with the opinion being expressed.

true,hit_a_six349,null,null,"&gt; Jose did the same thing with Joe Cole years ago.

The thing is that while his defending improved, it came at the cost of his attacking flair.

As we all know, the stereotypical Mourinho team are tough to break down, very organised, defend well and score when they have to. Don't get me wrong I remember (almost 10 years ago now) when he first came and that stereotype was hung around our necks, when we actually did manage to play some **very** attacking football.

Having said that, this year we've looked incredibly stagnant at times, to the point where it begins to be painful to watch. While I was one of the first people to hate Benitez right through the door, he gradually won my respect (grudging or not) because we actually managed to play football that was winning **AND** was easy on the eye.

My belief is that Mata was at the heart of that. He is one of our most talented, if not the most, players we have today. I remember reading about a comparison between him and Zola. Give it a few more years (1-3) and thats a legitimate argument. For the past 2 seasons he has been one of the highlights of our squad because of his play, attitude (played for almost 3 years straight, not because he had to, but because he wanted to) and clear love for club and game.
While his plight of not starting games has been overexaggerrated by the media, he definitely hasn't been utilised properly for important games. It seems, to me, that Mourinho picked a fight with him to remind everyone at the club who's boss, which IMO is an incredibly petty thing to do. There are better ways than these.

&gt; the man has earnt his respect from all Chelsea fans

I can't disagree that his past actions will put him into the category of Chelsea legends, however he has begun a new chapter at the club. Meaning that all past achievements (no matter how glorious and my oh my were they just!) have to be set aside and a clean slate begun. We are in 3rd place and we qualified, but nowadays the bar is set much higher and Jose is fully aware of this. Our squad seems to have enough talent and depth to at the very least attempt a quadruple - i.e. worst case scenario being 2nd in PL and finals for LC, FA and UCL. As to the above mentioned talent, it also means achieving said ^minimal goals through playing 'attractive' football - for most people meaning plenty of goals and attacking, while winning.

EDIT: Forgot to mention that this doesn't mean I want Mourinho gone, but rather I want him to adapt his tactics to have more ""calculated"" risks, as there is almost no chance of him being sacked, at least for a year or two and so he should feel free to experiment.",0,1385614265,null,0,1385614451,0,cdoq88f,t3_1rlx9t,t1_cdoq88f,t1_cdokwq5,null,1428478731,5,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,5

And that is the important thing. Consistency to the story and how you set it up. In Martin's case he set the world up in such a way that it can make it more exciting and one can get a real sense of danger because just about anyone can die. And it keeps being unexpected.

Moffat can keep doing it the way he wants and he will. I personally like it when it's darker and more bloody, but I understand plenty of people don't like that. And I do understand it's a family friendly kind of show, although there have been plenty of dark episodes. And that's the way it should be.

The Moment took the form of the Bad Wolf. The Wolf contains all the power of the time vortex. This includes being able to make or break fixed points in time.

Given the Bad Wolf entity can manipulate the vortex at will and the Moment had enough control over that power to do all that it did in the episode it stands to reason that it used that power to let the Doctors through.

As for what the Moment would have done upon detonation I would assume it has something to do with a black hole.

So let's talk for a second here. Ivanovic has been playing so far forward the past 6-8 games that he might as well be playing in the midfield. And to that point, we basically have been playing three at the back, with Azpi tucking in extremely close to the CBs.

Ivan is absolutely atrocious when it comes to crossing the ball. He is a better CB than a RB in my opinion as well. 

So, slot him in at CB, play with an extra DCM, but allow Oscar more room to attack.

Play Mikel for obvious defensive reasons.

Play Ramires or Luiz in that spot next to Mikel for defensive purposes as well.

Willian plays because his work rate is incredible, and he tracks back a lot.

true,solo_sysygy,null,null,"A bit of my background, to give you context:

* Did my undergrad in the States

* After working for nearly 10 years, am now in grad school program that will result in a Masters from a top-tier public university in the US, but includes a year of study at a top-10 UK university.

* Currently studying in the UK

I would recommend against pursuing your degree in the UK, with a couple of important caveats. First, understand that you probably won't be able to get your degree more cheaply in the UK. Most folks here pay 9000 GBP a year; international students (especially the Chinese) pay significantly more.


Second, a bachelors in the UK is generally much more narrowly focused than in the US.  A liberal arts degree in the US usually includes a number of general education requirements (math for English majors, and vice versa); this basically doesn't happen in the UK.  So if you study environmental engineering, that may be the only thing you take classes in.  There is little flexibility here to take random electives.


The flip side of this is that you can often complete your degree in 3 years instead of four.  Also, many of the technical majors (e.g. physics, architecture) have 5-year programs where you come out with a master's degree.  So if know you want to do a masters, you can get it done much faster here. 


Another downside here is that unless you're going to Oxford or Cambridge, you're going to have significantly less time with the professors than in the US, including classroom time.  My classes in the States were usually 40 one-hour meetings; here you have 20 hours of classroom time.  So to compare, a masters here is one year of 10 classes (5 per term) at 20 hours each, for total of 200 hours of classroom time.  In the US, that same masters would be 600 to 800 hours of classroom time.


How do employers view the difference?  Hard to say, but knowing what I know now, I can say with confidence that most UK degrees represent far less raw education than their US counterparts, though for any degree you get out of it what you put into it, to a certain extent.  


Also, it may depend on where you go, but I'm pretty unimpressed with most of the facilities here.  Universities here were built in three waves: the ancient universities, the ""red-brick universities"" mostly built at the beginning of the 20th Century, and the ""plate glass universities"" (which constitute the bulk of the UK universities), which were all built in the 1960s.  Most of the latter are as ugly as sin.  The classrooms are cramped (I'm taking graduate level courses, and almost every one is packed with 40 students--more than double what you would see in the States) and the university culture is completely different. In general, the facilities are not as nice as what you would see at a good US university.


This is not to say that it has been a bad experience.  I love living in the UK, and the cultural experience alone has been totally worthwhile.  The professors (called ""lecturers"" here--being elevated to full professor status takes a lot more time) are generally on the same level as their US counterparts, and the grading is more strict than in the US.  Getting a first is more difficult--and thus more rewarding--than getting an A in a US class.


I met a student here who as a dual US/UK citizen decided to come to the UK for her undergrad.  I didn't have the heart to tell her that she probably made a bad decision, though I think she knew.  My recommendation to you is to look at US programs, and do a side-by-side comparison. If you can get into Oxford or Cambridge you should definitely go, but aside from those two, I wouldn't bother.  I do recommend studying here if you get the chance, but do it via an exchange program or something.

All your logic is good and dandy, but go play a real football match. Go play for 10 years. Try out a few formations and so on. Now, play a full back those full 10 years+, then be told to change to a centre back. It is a whole new position (especially with a three back formation) that you'd have to relearn a lot of things.

I'm serious though, your logic is fine, but it just doesn't work like that. Now, the other thing when you play a three back is defense. You can have the best three center backs playing, but will struggle if you aren't used to it. You have to push every attack out wide, then stall to let the DM's get back. That means the majority of the other teams attacks are very fast paced, and can be a mix between lots of crosses, or straight dribbling at defenders (which defenders are always known for hating). Three backs are great when you are playing a team who likes very slow buildup (ex/ see Italian play) or are very (***very***) small up front, where headers are non existent.

I see what you're saying that we are essentially playing three at the back, but that's the problem... We are **essentially** playing three at the back.

In my eyes 10 shouldn't be counted as 10 and 11 but rather the Doctor Donna (Donna as a time lord and the half human doctor from the meta crisis) would be 11. I still don't see that though as the Doctor Donna wasn't a full regeneration either, but half a regeneration spliced with human DNA. It's much easier to chalk all this up to another whoniverse discrepancy and call Tennant 10, Smith 11, and Capaldi 12. There is no canon.

EDIT: Both comments below me are forgetting that John Hurt would be considered the 9th regeneration making the meta crisis burn through 12, Smith becomes 13, and Capaldi becomes 14 so either way it's still messed up. They'll find a way to keep the show going no matter what which makes the whole debate on how old the Doctor is and what Regeneration he's actually on kind of pointless. Unless they make it the main plot line for Capaldi which would be really interesting.

Plus if were going off of total used regeneration energy you'd have to tally up every time the Doctor uses a bit of regeneration energy to save someone/fix something.

I'm thinking that the War Doctor is just 8 as he was getting old, and didn't regenerate *into* the War Doctor, therefor the Capaldi regeneration into 12 is still canon and would be officially The Doctors ""last"" regeneration. Unless when they rebooted the universe with the Pandorica, he got all his regenerations back somehow as he got remembered back into existence by Amy Pond. I only say that because he was pulled into that tear of time, and he could have technically somehow regained all of them because he was reinserted back into the universe as the 11th, he didn't have to relive his whole life over again, and therefor he didn't have to use his regenerations (I know its a big stretch lol).  My second theory is that River Song gave him regenerations in Berlin after she tried to kill him. I know she used her regeneration energy to heal him, but she used all of her remaining regenerations (which was like what, 9 or 10?), so if they actually transfer to real regenerations instead of just a healing energy The Doctor will have plenty more to boot.

Exist in the same Timey-Whimey universe.

Boy, people must be *real dumb* to go spend their money at the box office on a show that's being ""Killed"" by a writer who's been in control of the show for 3 years. In fact, they spent their money on a show that they could watch at home, but chose to see it on the big screen. I wonder how well it would have done if it was an exclusive theatre event?

Some people will complain about anything.

Not gonna predict points but I think we'll still be in a good position overall. 

This coming week will be a good time for BR to get some rotation in. I know some people dont want to mess with a winning formula, but we have players that are carrying minor knocks, and I don't know how many of them are fit enough for three full games in a week. Plus it's a chance for BR and crew to evaluate the squad again before the transfer window opens. Last year around new years is when Carra started playing instead of Skertl, for example. And I know Joe Cole featured a time or two in December before being sold.

Last year c.9,000 dogs were put to sleep in the UK (compared to c.10,000 rehomed) and that number will no go down this year.

The audience watched 11 grieve over the Ponds, but all we saw was 11 moping around, we weren't brought along for the ride. It was a show grieving and move on deal and precisely why a lot of people felt the Ponds weren't given a proper send off. Conversely, when we look at 10's companions and how they left, less time was spent on the grief, but the impacts were far greater as we were allowed to grieve with 10 as his companions left him. It's as simple as a passing mention, a longing glance that makes us feel the impact of these characters on the doctor. Yet 11s reign has largely been a cycle of loss and replacement without the liminal space of transition. Perhaps I can understand not revisiting 10s companions as a need to remove himself from the Davies era, but to almost behave as if the ponds never existed, (hell, even river barely makes an impactful return) is neglecting the need the audience has to grieve as well.

  &gt;Restriction of Offensive Weapons Act 1959

&gt;The Restriction of Offensive Weapons Act 1959 (amended 1961) (ROWA), prohibits the importation, sale, hire, lending, or gift of certain types of knives in England, Wales, and Scotland as of 13 June 1959.

   Age restrictions are 16 in England, 18 in Scotland. Crime Prevention seems to be the motive.  
       
  Edit, I've done a bit more digging (added some more works and fixed the formatting too) - here's a [image] (http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmhaff/112/11202.gif) from Parliament, top row lists 'Sharp Instrument' murder numbers from 1997-2008: it doesn't look like it's worked, really.  
  
  Lots of poisonings in 2002. How peculiar. ~~Also happens to be when murder numbers peaked, not sure why that is, I can't really think of what happened in 2002 apart from the Queen Mother kicking the bucket and the War on Terror kicking off. Probably not related~~. Below:  
  
  &gt;There were important 
changes in police recording practice in 1998 and 2002 which served to inflate the police 
figures and resulted in divergence from BCS trends. After the bedding-in of these changes, 
there has been more convergence in police recorded crime and BCS crime.  
  
   Presumably a classification change of what constitutes a murder, or different sentencing guidelines perhaps?

&gt;I don’t really understand the question. I’m tempted to say something like, “No, the John Hurt War Doctor is just something that happened in THE NAME OF THE DOCTOR, THE NIGHT OF THE DOCTOR and THE DAY OF THE DOCTOR on television.”

&gt;If it happens on the TV, it’s canonical, unless it isn’t. (For example, no-one seems entirely sure whether we get to see pre-Hartnell regenerations during the mindbending battles of Brain of Morbius.)

&gt;We now know there was a regeneration between the Paul McGann Eighth Doctor and the Chris Ecclestone Ninth Doctor, one whom the Doctor himself has only just begun to regard as being The Doctor (as opposed to being something else).

&gt;If you mean, “Do we now all have to agree to renumber all the Doctors?”, I think the main purpose of numbering things is to communicate, and we all know who we mean when we say Doctors NIne, Ten or Eleven. If anyone corrects you and says “You mean TWELFTH!” when you say “Matt Smith was the eleventh Doctor” then that person is being irritatingly pedantic and should be pitied, in a nice way and with a gentle friendly, not-patronising sort of love, because they will have long hard lives ahead of them.

Does anyone care to elaborate on what this actually means *for us*, and what our Government's representatives mean with their comments

As a side note, the recorded vote was 148 in favour, and 4 against, which obviously included the UK and the US.

**Some of the UK's comments:**

&gt; ""The representative of the United Kingdom said it was the responsibility of States to create the necessary enabling economic conditions, while the provisions of the draft could also curtail political and civil rights.""

&gt; ""The representative of the United Kingdom said his Government did not accept the concept of collective human rights under international law.  Individuals within groups should not be left vulnerable or unprotected by allowing the rights of the group to supersede the human rights of the individual.""

&gt; ""The representative of the United Kingdom expressed regret over the late circulation of the draft, as well as its lack of direct reference to freedom of expression.  The relevant Human Rights Council resolution did address the promotion and protection of human rights online, he said, voicing disappointment that such language was not included in the text just approved.""

&gt; ""The representative of the United Kingdom said her Government supported the right to development through its disbursement of 0.7 per cent of gross national income as official development assistance (ODA).  However, she added, she had not been able to vote in favour of the draft because it was the responsibility of States to create the necessary enabling economic conditions, while the provisions of the draft could also curtail political and civil rights.""

Is this something that we have to actually enforce in the UK, or is it an apparent 'take it or leave it' kind of thing?

That's no different to an atheist saying ""all Christians believe the Earth is 6000 years old"" or ""god hates fags"". There are some who believe that, sure, but they are a minority. Look around some atheist groups, or at the statements of famous atheists, and you'll see the same thing - the majority do not rule out the existence of any gods, just rate it as highly improbable; while a few go further and say that gods do not (or cannot) exist. There is even a phrase to distinguish those who believe there is no god from those who lack belief: ""strong atheists"", a subset of atheists.

&gt; You can't say 'I lack belief' whilst believing a god to be impossible or invented or illogical. 

For ""impossible"" you are right. For ""invented"" or ""illogical"" you are not. You can believe something is invented or illogical and still think it is possible it exists.

&gt; The lack belief argument is simply a semantic trick so that atheists don't have to support their position

Channel 4 is a statutory corporation, independent of Government, and governed by a unitary board made up of executive and non-executive directors, who are responsible for ensuring that Channel 4 fulfils its remit and delivers its financial responsibilities. Non-executive directors are appointed by OFCOM in agreement with the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport.

because atheists do not simply lack belief. you cannot say ""god is a fairy tale"" or 'god is illogical' and maintain that what you have is simply a 'lack of belief'. what you have is an active belief in no-god. you believe there is no god. and that is not the position of the genuine agnostic, who does not have a position. 

&gt; If someone, anyone, answers the question ""Do you believe in a god or gods?"" with anything other than ""Yes"" then they are an atheist.

nope. they could be anything from a strong atheist to an agnostic to a doubting christian. to answer 'i'm not sure' does not make you an atheist any more than than answering 'are you a Tory?' with anything other than a 'yes' makes you a labour supporter.

I'm glad you agree. That is exactly what it is - a rejection of belief, not a belief in its own right.

No, they aren't. It can be ridiculous, but that doesn't mean it isn't true. There are plenty of ideas that have been ridiculed when first proposed that were later found to be true.

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"&gt; Arguments are usually not against the existence of gods, they are counters to arguments for the existence of some god or other.

right, which usually means they are advocating a 'there is no god' position

&gt; I'm glad you agree. That is exactly what it is - a rejection of belief, not a belief in its own right.

if you believe there is no god, that is a belief. and that is the position of most self-professed atheists, even if they try to weasel around it. 

belief is not knowledge, it's much more nebulous. when someone says they believe in god, or believe there is no god, they aren't making statements of knowledge or fact. they're indicating their leaning or position, and when it comes to the subject of god, atheists obviously take a position. 

&gt; It can be ridiculous, but that doesn't mean it isn't true.

correct, but if you are saying it's ridiculous you obviously believe it to be false. and that is belief. 

&gt; There are plenty of ideas that have been ridiculed when first proposed that were later found to be true.

of course, but are you saying theism is likely to be one of these? 

&gt; Do you think it is reasonable to say that all Christians reject evolution, believe the world is 6000 years old, and think that their god hates fags? Of course you don't, and you would think it a ridiculous mischaracterisation.

no of course not because that is demonstrably untrue. 

&gt; The same is true here

incorrect. the definition of atheism includes 'disbelief' in God, infact a casual perusal of dictionary definitions reflects the common-day usage of the term; someone who believes there is no god/gods. (http://www.thefreedictionary.com/atheist)

the definition you prefer is simply an attempt to avoid backing up ones position. babies are atheists by your definition, though common sense tells us this is ridiculous. a baby is no more an atheist than a toaster is.

In principle maybe, but in practice the overwhelming majority of goods available in this country are sold by companies which advertise on TV. Whatever you buy, you can be confident some portion of the spend finds its way there.

Also, there is only a certain amount of money being spent on advertising at a given time. If the BBC suddenly had to take its share of that, it would hugely reduce the amount of money available to all TV makers for production and commisioning, thus reducing quality all round.

The BBC is unique in it's ethos, it provides something for everybody without having to bow down to the demands of commercial entities.  Yes a lot of the BBC peak output is commercial in style but hell this is what gets the viewers they have to display to the regulator , maybe you think you are above this stuff and thats fine but 10million viewers+ will always justify expenditure.  However No other organisation could have such diversity in it's output and have a channel such as BBC4 which shows well made factually accurate documentaries which often only pull in a few hundred thousand viewers or even 6 music with it's eye firmly on the pulse of the less commercial music scene.

I guess I know why your business went to crap and left you with a mountain of debt. Keeping up to date accounts is extremely important.

Most businesses which fail with a load of debt tend to be because the owners thought that sending off a carrier bag of receipts to the accountant once a year in January was sufficient. 

Where you are is you're not entitled to tax credits and because they continued to pay you after April 6th, all tax credits paid for the current financial year are now repayable. 

They couldn't take your income from your tax return in April because tax details for the tax year 2012-2013 aren't actually finalised until 31/1/2014 which is 4 months after the cut off date for tax credits renewal.

In regards to the £1000, if eventually after this mess is resolved they decide you still owe it it is what is known as a priority debt.

I'm sorry but I have no idea how you deduced this opinion from my post. 

I would also say that there a lot more than 'a few novelty seekers' in Korea and China. China itself is probably the fastest growing Christian population. I say probably, because the state-sponsored people's church is largely ignored and the underground church is the one booming, but the exact numbers are not clear.

This doesn't make any sense at all. Requiring a subscription fee to access is no different to requiring a licence fee to access. (Unless you are including illegal viewing of the BBC as ""the principle of universal access""). 

&gt; In principle maybe, but in practice the overwhelming majority of goods available in this country are sold by companies which advertise on TV. Whatever you buy, you can be confident some portion of the spend finds its way there.

But, as I said, everyone buying those goods and services has judged they are getting benefit out of the deal. There is no compulsion involved.

&gt; If the BBC suddenly had to take its share of that, it would hugely reduce the amount of money available to all TV makers for production and commisioning, thus reducing quality all round.

This argument could be used for subsidizing one player in any industry.

If the BBC paid less, many of those presenters would move to commercial networks.  However, there would also be twice as many of them, so their overall value would fall.

true,brainburger,cnty-uk,London,"&gt; Requiring a subscription fee to access is no different to requiring a licence fee to access. (Unless you are including illegal viewing of the BBC as ""the principle of universal access""). 

The assumption I am making (backed by fact, I feel)  is that the big majority of households have a TV, and so have to pay the license, and can watch the BBC. However, many less pay the extra to watch Sky, for example. There is univeral access to the BBC, but not to Sky, under its subscription model.

&gt;But, as I said, everyone buying those goods and services has judged they are getting benefit out of the deal. There is no compulsion involved.

It seems silly to argue that there is compulsion to own a TV, but no compulsion to buy food. Yes you can avoid buying food, but only small minority have the resources for that. If I choose not to fund ITV at all, its pretty hard to do. I am actually struggling to avoid paying into the Murdoch empire, as they took over my ISP recently.

&gt;This argument could be used for subsidizing one player in any industry. The more pertinent point is that the money from this highly regressive tax would be left in households pockets to pay for things they prefer, and improving the quality of those sectors.

That's true. However I think that the overall benefit to society is likely to be reduced in that case.

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; Yes because a mandatory requirement of entry is adoption of the Euro and meeting fiscal targets for 3 years prior to entry. Scotland can only be considered for the fiscal tests to start once they're independent.

I think you are confusing two things.

The Maastricht treaty commits new members to joining the Euro at some point, it does not require adoption before entry (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Croatia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Sweden are all EU members who don't use the Euro - and have no formal opt-out to do so).

The requirement to demonstrate fiscal stability is [one of the five criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_convergence_criteria) for adopting the Euro, not for EU membership. Another one of those criteria is two years membership of the ERM II. As this is voluntary then in practice any country can essentially postpone Euro membership indefinitely.

&gt; Germany's reunification is irrelevant to a point because it preceded the formation of the current EU with a single currency.

I think its relevance is really because it was a situation without precedent, had an arguably greater impact on the EU, and yet was resolved relatively quickly despite the objections from some EU leaders.

There is no precedent for a country within a member state becoming a member in its own right. So while the Scottish situation is in some sense unknown I think it is pretty clear that it would in Scotland, rUK, and the EU's interests for Scotland to move from being in the EU as part of the UK to being in part of the EU as a member state.

No. The BBC is well-regarded by their competitors. ITV, CH4, Sky all take their cues from BBC success and failure. Sky News defines itself as not taking BBC News' approach. Then there's the technology and innovation, the facilities, the stability of having a 25% Independent Production Quota (value around £250m) and a 25% quota of competition between Independents and BBC in-house, the great training of crew, journalists, talent and staff that can then be hired for bigger fees without the hassle of teaching... 

Then the BBC as a globally prominent brand is a huge asset, whether its an ITV programme sold to the BBC's commercial channels around the world, or its the selling of their footage as archive through BBC Motion Gallery. The BBC is the world's largest distributor of television content, and acts as sales rep for numerous small production companies in the UK.

Or other channels avail themselves of technical services through BBC Studios &amp; Post, all the while, ITV and CH4 can get away without having an expensive, inconvenient R&amp;D department because the BBC has them covered.

There is universal access to the BBC, but not to Sky, under its subscription model.

So the only ""universal access"" that exists is because there is a mandate to buy the subscription (if you have a TV) which does not exist in the Sky case?

&gt; It seems silly to argue that there is compulsion to own a TV, but no compulsion to buy food. Yes you can avoid buying food, but only small minority have the resources for that. If I choose not to fund ITV at all, its pretty hard to do. I am actually struggling to avoid paying into the Murdoch empire, as they took over my ISP recently.

I'm not saying there is compulsion in buying a TV. I'm saying there is compulsion in buying the TV licence to fund the BBC. If you buy food, you are buying the food you want to consume. If you're paying for the TV licence, it may well be because you wish to watch other channels. (This is the situation in my case.) 

&gt; This is fundamentally an argument about individual choice and responsibilty and the benefits of shared resources and responsibilities. I don't want to be like one of the countries that forgets the latter for the former.

I disagree. I strongly believe in sharing resources for things that are are needed for human rights that could not be otherwise provided to everyone by the market: healthcare, education etc. That is a very different case from showings of Eastenders and Bargain Hunt.

The end goal of a pension is to buy an annuity when you retire. An annuity will give you can income for the rest of your life, based on how much you bought it for.  So ideally you want a big sum of money to buy one with, which you build up with a pension. So a pension is really just a big savings account.

For how much you should put in - the rule of thumb is basically you should save half your age as a percentage (ie, at 24, 12%). If you cant save that much, do as much as you can afford. Many company pensions are matched - ie, i can put in 4% of my salary and my company puts in another 4% - so i get 8% of my salary going in, while it only costs me 4%.

The money you put into a pension scheme is typically spread across many stock market funds. By law you cant withdraw it till at least you are 55 - then you can take 25% as a lump sum and must buy an annunity with the rest of it. You usually get some level of control over these funds - ie, you can opt for more risky ones that promise higher returns on your money, or you can stick to 'safe' ones that are more stable but lower return.

oh, its worth mentioning that you will be getting a pension - the government has made it law that everyone will be contributing to one, so your employer should be bringing in a pension scheme.

For example, Fox News provides extensive coverage and quoted sources from the President (which is the same basis of that study by the way) but does that mean Fox News supports Barrack Obama? Of course not!

Maybe you should actually think about things before making statements you can't even back up with a half decent study. I mean let's look at the flaws in it:

1) How you report the news is far more important then the time you give to each subject. No consideration is given to how these stories were reported, the actual data shows the political affiliation of sources used by the BBC during 2012 to be the Tories at 48%, and the Prime Minister was quoted much more. In theory they could be using the PM as a source and then blatantly attack him on air, they didn't as it's the BBC but it makes the point that the study totally ignores the ""how"".

2) They have picked 2007 as a year to compare against 2012, why? 2012 was a year 2 years after a coalition government of conservatives and liberal democrats lead by a (sadly) charismatic and news savvy leader (and his lib dem sidekick) have been making controversial government decisions. 2007 on the other hand was 2 years after the Labour government was elected with a comfortable majority, but the leader resigned (Blair) and was taken over by a decidedly *not* media savvy leader in the form of Gordon Brown. No really controversial decisions were taken in 2007 as Blair was a ""lame duck"" PM at that point and Brown wasn't going to make any controversial decisions in the first 6-8 months of his job (or at least, not like cutting the budget like the ConDem coalition has done).

The only things the two years have in common is that the government was elected two years prior to that. I mean  really, the *leaders* of the parties haven't even been in charge the same length of time.  

3) Even though they present the data in a table within the report, I have to doubt the methodology used to attain it. According to their data the SNP represented **0%** (and 0 in total) of sources during 2007, yet 5% of sources during 2012? Just googling ""SNP BBC 2007""  gets at least this one http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6646227.stm 

If you can now actually bother linking me to the reports you have actually read to give you the opinion that the BBC reports on news with a right wing bias, rather then making a statement that ""reports on the statement actually say this"" and then trying to desperately hope Google has the evidence to back you up it would be appreciated.

[UK Polling Report](http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/) puts the likely result of the next GE at a likely Labour majority of 76.

Of course, a *lot* can change in 18 months, and probably will. But if anyone can win outright, it will be Labour.

&gt; A show source explained: ""There have been two David Tennant Doctor Whos technically and with John Hurt playing another Doctor in the film, it basically means he can't regenerate again.

This is from Moff and Company, as official as it gets.

&gt; Corp tax is 20%...

You're right, but taking an over-simplistic view. So, for that matter, is the first five seconds of the video.

It's 20% of your **net profit before paying out things like dividends**. 

Let's take an incredibly simple example: Acme Widgets Ltd. buys a million widgets for £1 each and sells them for £3.

They turnover £3 million - in other words, that is how much money is coming into the business.

Of that £3 million, £1 million was spent on buying the widgets in the first place. That leaves £2 million.

£500,000 was spent on staff wages (which sounds like a lot, but 20 people earning an average salary of £26k - which, according to the ONS, is the UK average wage - would cost around £half a mill). That leaves £1.5 million.

Employer's National Insurance works out at around 11% (it's actually a bit more complicated than that, but I believe that's the usual rule of thumb used) - which means that there's another £55,000 going to HMRC in tax.

£120,000 was spent on renting a warehouse to store all these widgets in between taking delivery of them and shipping them back out. 

£70,000 was spent on shipping costs. (Couriers add up when you're shipping that many widgets).

The old forklift truck finally broke down beyond economical repair back in January. Replacement was £20,000.

There is a thumping great loan with the bank that the directors took out when they started the business. That loan attracts a cool £15,000 a year in interest and another £20,000 per year in repayments.

The business is legally obliged to have employer's liability insurance, they'd also be absolutely stupid not to have product liability and contents insurance. That's not going to be cheap - I'd be surprised to see much change out of £10,000, though obviously it depends on the a lot of variables. We'll say £10,000 to make the maths easy.

£10,000 was spent on stationery (got to print labels, invoices, that sort of stuff).

You have to spend a lot of time on the phone to shift £3 million worth of widgets - in fact, you need something a bit more sophisticated than just one phone. You need a proper phone system with extensions and everything. The bill for that little lot for the year came to £4,000. 

None of your staff are particularly IT-literate, so rather than have them hunting around Google when things go wrong you pay an outside company to come in. That typically comes to about £5-6000 per year.


This is just me pulling a few numbers out of the air, but you can already see that even a relatively small business incurs a lot of costs. 

While it may very well be the case that Amazon are employing tricks to avoid paying tax (it wouldn't be difficult - for all practical purposes, corporation tax is optional), to paint a scenario where a company turning over £10 million should be paying £2 million in tax is downright wrong.",0,1385637808,null,0,false,0,cdovdb6,t3_1rluvr,t1_cdovdb6,t1_cdotf52,null,1428476261,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,YeahBruvInit,uk,United Kingdom,"I think Salmond is a clever politician, and he's doing as much as a he can within the constraints of reality.  He can't promise/guarantee anything at this point, so being a politician he's using weasel words/making assumptions that sound like fact to project the kind of treaty he will argue for. 

He's also painting any desent to Scotland's 'fair and reasonable' expectations as bitterness on the part of the rest of the UK.  

As a nationalist politician he doesnt want to present a fair and balanced view - he's arguing for separation.  As such, he's not going to admit that everything's up for debate, and something like EU entry could be scuppered by a few EU states not wanting to see nations and regions of their own break off via a 'proven' process.

Think of the ramifications: Belgium would have a proven option for separation.  Spain's strong 'internal nations' would as well.  What of all the effort that went to trying to put the balkans back together? And the Northern League in Italy?  German states might see it as an option since they'll still be 'culturally German' but would have 'more say' than they do at present in Europe.

It's not a can of worms I can see any EU state being pleased with.  Also it seems like a sneaky way of inheriting the treaty concession which the UK had negotiated from the perspective of being a 60million+ population trillion pound economy state.

Why is it fair on Holland, Poland, Denmark any of the nations with greater populations than Scotland, that Scotland should benefit from all the rebates/concessions made to sweaten the EU for the UK?

In reality, I would expect Scotland would be allowed into the EU as a new state, via the normal process.  There may be some temporary/emergency legislation put in place to ensure that for a limited period access to markets/labour is maintained.  Again, I don't know why the EU would feel obliged to stick to SNP-mandated timelines.
Scotland, lovely country and all that, but it's just not THAT important in the grand scheme of things.

This is one of the things that bugs me - 50% of driver admit to breaking speed limit regularly, or recent figure I read said 80% admit to using a phone. And the general population seems to be indifferent. Yet, a cyclists does something illegal and the issue is cyclists being out of control?

It gives a bit of background on each incarnation of the doctor, his companions, enemies etc. and talks about why each episode/serial is worth watching. 

Some of the Classic serials I personally recommend are 
""An Unearthly Child""
""Genesis of the Daleks""
""Pyramids of Mars""
""City of Death"" (silly, but good)
""Earthshock"" (sad)

Worth seeing some classic companions like Sarah Jane Smith and Romana as well as Ace (some of the last episodes of season 26 are pretty good after a poor spell).

Depending on where you live, you can buy many of these serials on DVD, or I believe you can also purchase them online in places like iTunes or Amazon or through other (ahem) slightly more dubious means.

Hope that helps!

There doesn't HAVE to be. The alternative is to have the fullbacks add width on attack and whip in crosses (so Walker and Rose). The DM drops back and splits the CB's to keep some defensive shape. 

Of course, because Rose is injured this just really isn't an option right now, it does make you wonder why AVB insists on the inverted wingers when he doesn't have the wide men to unlock them.

Inverted wingers, fullbacks adding width.

true,Kitchner,cnty-wales,Wales,"Yeah I pretty much agree with what you say here. I'm obviously not Scottish but it does genuinely astound me how much people buy into stuff that is just not going to happen in reality.

I mean look at the whole north sea oil business, do they really think they are going to keep 100% of the revenue from the oil? International law dictates a 90:10 split in favour of Scotland, but if the UK says it will simply veto Scotland joining the EU unless we get more of an share of the oil, what choice does Scotland have?

The idea that the UK would ""look bad"" for veto-ing Scotland's entry into the EU is daft. I mean if Catalonia broke away from Spain and then Spain veto'd their entry into the EU, would anyone be surprised? Would anyone care? I mean sure some world leaders may tut and wag their finger but they wont actually care.

There are plenty of arguments for a more devolved Scottish government, or even an independent Scotland, but generally they are not things you can quantify. It's stuff like protecting Scottish culture, the disparity between life in London and life in Scotland (or anywhere else in the UK for that matter). 

No-one can honestly produce anything that convinces me Scotland will be *economically* better off after a split without an assumption that Scotland will keep all or nearly all the oil revenue. Plus the assumption that there is trillions of pounds worth of oil there is the one the SNP use, which varies wildly, plus the fact that oil may be greatly devalued if there is a breakthrough in the next 10 years or so in green technology.

The whole argument they have chosen to go with is based of ""facts"" and ""figures"" which are usually extremely bias and absurd, I honestly don't get why some people believe it all.

Robbing the cigarette companies of their branding is actually quite powerful. Companies spend huge amounts of money on advertising (even though we don't see much of it for cigarettes in the UK) and branding, and the look, style, colours and design of the packet are all meant to convey that brand. Is it strong or weak, manly or feminine, classy or rugged and badass? Basically, they are trying to take away some of the sex appeal and the value - a bit like how Tesco value comes in a gross white packet with red writing that makes you want to pay slightly more for the branded stuff. It's also widely known that packaging makes food taste better. Look at Malcolm Gladwells talks about coke and pepsi. Real coke in a generic bottle doesn't taste as good as it does when poured from a branded coke bottle.

It's also harder to build brand association, strong preferences or long-lasting customer loyalty without branded packets. There won't be much to differentiate various companies apart from price.

I would hold it out for the next fifty years. As in, the next few series will be just going with regular stories. Doctor meets new companion, goes places, saves days, while sometimes the missing Gallifrey gets mentioned. 

He's looking for something, yearning to go home. Then goes around doing stuff. 

While interspread hints of this technology some race has developed that allows for inter universe travel. Probably in the form of an invasion from another universe where the creatures aren't in the shape of humanoids. i.e. two arms, two legs, body and a head. and chase them throughout the universe. (This would be the Daleks if the Doctors put the Daleks in their pocket universe instead of Gallifrey) and the invader would appear at random everywhere through cracks all over the universe. 

Then there would be a big reveal where these creatures are actually interdimensional travellers. They appear in our universe wherever they want, but not whenever they want, because their time and our time don't sync well. For instance a year in their time may conform to 100 years in our time, or at other times, a year in their time would mean 100 million years in our time. Making the Doctor the only man who can save the universe throughout time and space.

Until one day, he got through to their universe, and the TARDIS acquire the capability for interdimensional travel. Which would mean, modifying the TARDIS name to include some interdimensional capabilities.

The Doctor would then travel through the time, space, and interdimensional multiverse to look for Gallifrey.

Sometimes, the dimensions aren't three dimension plus time like ours, sometimes, it's four dimensions or twenty dimensions, and the episode will be shot by two dimensional projection of a three dimensional shadow of (for example) a four dimensional space. [Like so](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:8-cell-simple.gif). (in 3D stereoscopic of course, this being future episodes and all, maybe in the near future, we'll all be watching the doctor in our oculus rift)

And of course, interspread, there would be heart wrenching moments where he lost a few companions, had to kill one to save a planet, or failed to save one from a nazi universe, and perhaps, meet that metacrisis Tennant Doctor who lives with Rose Tyler in a universe on their own. Well, them being a lot older now, being grandparents and all. Think of the cute Tennant-Tyler grandkids!

And on the 100th anniversary, they finally found Gallifrey and took a few dozen doctors to quickly bring it back to our universe, via that tech they use to froze the planet in the first place. By reversing the polarity, naturally. Well.

Third, even if it was feasible, who would pay for it? Should Scotland take a 10% share, approximate to their population, or a larger share for forcing this problem on the rest of the UK?

Having said that - although Boris is riding a wave of (for lack of a better word) 'popularity' as Mayor of London, I wouldn't seriously rate his chances of ever being prime minister. His quirky and curiously endearing belligerence works well as Mayor of London and has helped to carve out the role.... But I doubt his style would win enough votes outside the capital, particularly in the north of England where his public schoolboy image makes David Cameron look like an everyman. Also, Johnson is locked into his role as Mayor of London until 2016 - so his next shot at a general election wouldn't be until 2020, by which time he'll be 56 years old... which by modern standards is fairly old for a first term prime minister, and goes against a global trend towards younger leaders.

true,mushroomgodmat,null,null,"&gt;Now that we've established cyclists can be dangerous if they hit pedestrians, why should we not focus on them breaking road laws?

Iv never said otherwise. I have no time for anti social anything - Cyclist, walking, talking or driving.

The issue I make (and many other cyclists make) it the perspiration of cyclists (as a group) is wildly different to that of drivers (as a group). And there is little or no proof to back up these perceptions other than being very selective with your criticisms. Some have noted similarities with racism, or bigotry. 

I really have no problem with fining cyclists


&gt;Keep in mind that /r/uk is not a place to study every news story - hot topics rise, cold topics fall as it is with all of Reddit. We don't get paid for this - we're not obliged to study and comment on every single story of every single collision in the land.

Its not to much reddit - its news channels in general.  One person dies a day to drink driving. Most don't hear about it, most probably don't care, but that doesn't mean it doesn't happen.

&gt;Regardless - my point is not that you're an organised group at all but rather it's hard to reach any kind of conclusion when the current road infrastructure doesn't police cyclists properly (I saw 3 run red lights yesterday on my commute home, I should keep score...) but cyclists argue that they want a firmer line when it comes to their own safety and the prosecution of drivers.
That - to me - is wanting it both ways. Safety from others and freedom to do what you want regardless of the legality.

We are no more an organised group than say pedestrians. We share common experiences that most of us can relate too. But that's it.

Iv never once defended red light jumping without good reason. And iv never once done it myself (more on law breaking later ;)

But to use something of your own argument - its irrelevant to me if 3 other cyclists jump a red light anymore than its relevant to you that a driver got drunk and killed someone....I'm a driver too, where the smeg does that put me in the blame or responsibility game?

&gt;Solution? A hard line on all law breaking road users. Hell - issue spot fines and use it to fund the police service for all I care. Assuming I don't break road laws I have nothing to fear there - and you know what? Neither would you assuming you don't either. The only losers would be the drivers, cyclists and anyone else who can't use the roads safely.

I agree with you fully on the 1st point. But not agreeing with you fully on the latter point.

Cyclists get bullied all the time by much larger bigger traffic - and thats really not an exaggeration to prove a point. And ultimately the highway code is not designed for cyclists, and yet cyclists are expected to follow it even though that might put their lives in danger. These are not concerns that drivers have to worry about. In fact most drivers probably don't see the problem.

Which is a problem that is historical and cultural. We have effectively designed cyclist off the road, and now - people (those who dare cycle), the government, and the EU want them back because they are seen as a good thing.

The issue is its not safe. And if you don't break the law you could potentially die....What would you do?

Slight tangent....

Before I started cycling my attitude was exactly like yours - After a year of cycling my attitude started to change. I am a confident enough cyclist that im more than happy to share the road with cars, I am whats described as a vehicular cyclist -  I can hit speeds of 35mph, and Im often faster than cars in the city.

I don't want to be a vehicular cyclist but that's what I am because thats what makes me safe. And to get to that stage takes a lot of work and pedaling ;p

Now....My wife cycles, and soon my son will be too. I do not want to them to scared shitless because some twat thinks its a good laugh to pass them at 30-40mph with inches to spare. I want them to be safe. 

And you know what....Id ask them to cycle on the pavement as result of behavior like that. I would also ask them to give pedestrians total priority, but I don't want them dead. And while the police are not doing anything about cyclists jumping lights, they are not doing anything to stop aggressive behavior towards cyclists either.

Ultimately this is an issue of bad outdated road layouts and a crap highway code that does not enforce cycling practices. It leaves new and old drivers with a attitude that is not helpful or safe to others (see Emma way).

And with all that in mind, I can excuse in certain situations where law breaking makes sense. That does not mean I excuse twats in a rush and only in a rush, or aggressive cycling.

But until things change (maybe take a generation or two) that's the way it will remain.

&gt; Matt Smith's last episode as Doctor Who was re-written after he injured his leg, according to reports.

&gt; The injury was written into the script of the Christmas Day show so fans will see the Time Lord lose a leg after a battle with the Weeping Angels.

ALSO:

&gt;http://shows.stv.tv/this-morning/lifestyle/225149-im-choosing-to-have-my-leg-amputated/

&gt;Three years ago, Matt Smith slipped on a cobble while walking back from the shops and sprained his ankle.

&gt;Thinking it was a trivial injury, he believed a bit of physio and a few weeks rest would soon see him back to normal.

&gt;This was not the case: Weeks turned into months, treatment after treatment failed, and still the excruitating pain in Matt's ankle persisted.

&gt;Matt is still unable to work, support his family or play with his daughter, and feels that the chronic pain has left him with only one option - on Wednesday he will have his let amputated below the knee.

some questions for you:

what do you mean by 'wrong' in this case?

do you believe all morality is objective, or is some of it subjective? if the later, where are the lines drawn?

if you believe some moral positions are subjective, do you then believe all opinions on such matters are equal (which your post above suggests you would)

if it is objectively morally wrong to do an act, how can such an act occur? how is a child rapist able to believe that what they are doing is acceptable in such a reality?

was raping a human child objectively wrong before humans existed? if no, when did it become morally wrong to do so?

would it be morally wrong to rape a child, if it meant preventing the otherwise instant deaths of half the population of Earth? how in general does an objective morality deal with such circumstances?

is stoning a women to death objectively wrong?

is killing the first born sons objectively wrong?

is slavery objectively morally wrong? if yes, do you think all the people involved were aware of this? 

how can you(or anyone) be sure of the truth of what they believe to be objectively moral positions when morality is so dependent on historical and cultural setting?

CHIPZEL

BAFTA-Nominated Chipzel is the alias of Niamh Houston, an independent Northern Irish chip-musician who indulges in the use of Gameboys to create energetic, melodic dance tracks. Through taking the original 8bit sound and manipulating it into something frantically hard-hitting, Chipzel has seen crowds of all ages turn to “raving loons”, taken right back to their days of retro gaming.

TDK

After absolutely killing it at SuperByte Festival in Manchester, it seems only right to bring the guy back to the North West as soon as humanly possible! 
""During 1989-1993 TDK wrote chiptunes, on the Commodore Amiga, for demogroups such as Anthrox, Crystal and Melon Dezign. He moved to video game development in 1992, composing for titles such as Wing Commander, Duke Nukem, Populous 3 and Dungeon Keeper 2. He has worked on a number of BAFTA award winning video games, and now heads up the sound team at Codemasters on the F1, DiRT and GRID franchises. TDK came out of retirement in 2011 and released his first chiptune album, Reawakening, in 2012. His 2nd album will fuse his passion for chiptune with his other passion for the violin, which he has been playing since he was 6 years old""

No one was that bothered in the 1990s when John Major did it. There is NO difference between Major becoming PM mid-term, or Brown, or if Michael Gove suddenly became PM. None.

Heck, even Eden was selected first. Then held an election. 

Oh and most famously you forget Churchill only won his election the second time of asking. 

His first term as PM , he wasn't elected

""he commonly accepted version of events states that Lord Halifax turned down the post of prime minister because he believed he could not govern effectively as a member of the House of Lords instead of the House of Commons. Although the prime minister does not traditionally advise the King on the former's successor, Chamberlain wanted someone who would command the support of all three major parties in the House of Commons. A meeting between Chamberlain, Halifax, Churchill and David Margesson, the government Chief Whip, led to the recommendation of Churchill, and, as constitutional monarch, George VI asked Churchill to be prime minister. Churchill's first act was to write to Chamberlain to thank him for his support.[162]""

Try me you stupid fucking cunt.

&gt; Here's your problem, Lennon and Bale are wide players and aren't considered part of the midfield, i.e they predominantly don't play in the middle of the field. So now that's been corrected...

...Actually the middle of the field (for me, and generally here in the UK... I'm guessing thats not where you are? :P) is the area of the pitch/team between defence (in our case the back four) and our strikers / strikER at the very front. So if we're playing a 4-4-2 or 4-4-1-1 (not uncommon under the Red Napkin) the midfield is GARETH BALE, AARON LENNON, SCOTT PARKER, RAFA VAN DER VAART and LUKA MODRIC.

&gt; So now that's been corrected you're left with Parker, Modric and Van Der Vaart. 

By your definition, to take midfield as ""play in the middle of the field"", Parker is practically a defender and Van Der Vaart is pretty much a striker, so according to you our midfield at that time consisted solely of Luka Modric, our only true central midfielder.

For me LENNON - SCOTT PARKER - MODRIC - VDV - BALE was the greatest midfield in world football history. I've never seen anything like it and probably will again. The only midfield I'd say to even come close (or in fact give that set-up a run for its money) is Real Madrid at the present time. ALONSO - MODRIC - ISCO - BALE - RONALDO.



&gt; then you must be either blind or not very bright.

If you think that, why are you trying to start a fight with me, you clueless cunt? Why can't you just let me wallow in my ignorance? Fuck off fuck off fuck off and take all your horse shit with you.

It shows the UK slap bang in the lower-middle in costs and includes way more countries.

That, coupled with large gaps in capacity (present and future) due to state non-investment in previous decades, means the private companies have to literally plough a heck of a lot of cash into the infrastructure and generating capacity. 

Furthermore, the addition of the ECO + other levies, the EU green laws on high carbon plants such as old style 'dirty' coal, meaning we are closing down perfectly viable plants leaves private power companies not in a fantastic position.

Now - before you reply and start saying I'm an asshole whatever, bear in mind these companies are not perfect by a long shot. But they are doing not too badly with a pretty awful hand - they don't make that much profit at [4.3% last year-  EDF even made a loss](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25092169) and are investing for the long term energy needs of the country.

I think you are confusing the difference between having a constitutionally established ""right"" to vote for a leader with our *de facto* system of making the 'given' member of the party with a majority prime minister.

But really there is so much history in it. Christianity spread to Northern Europe at a time when the Roman Empire had just fallen, massive depopulation had occurred because of it, in this state of affairs it served as an organising principle. It's so intimately intertwined with our development that there really no way to know how things would be without it, except ""different, very different"". Prior to Christianity we were living in a mostly oral and illiterate culture and that culture was overwhelmed by the literary culture that became imposed on it (presumably because literary things survive the generations better than oral ones when in competition).

Still I think the values that Christianity espouses are significantly more palatable to me than the values of say the Aztecs, of Islam or even of something like Hinduism (which I find quite fascinating).

Social conditions and pre-existing cultural values made Christianity what it was, and Christianity made the liberal secularism that followed it what it was - and all those developments were also effected by material and economic conditions as well as cultural and intellectual ones.

I disagree that the academy has been the pipeline of great players that is portrayed in the article. No-one has made it to the first the and stuck there for years since Gerrard and crew. That's an awful shame given the Shankly legacy of building the club's strength from within. 

Which is an interesting parallel with Rodgers, actually. When Shanks first arrived at Liverpool, he strengthened by buying aggressively at first. Then he introduced homegrown players more and bought smart additions from outside more sparingly. (Granted I'm asserting this from memory rather than sources I have at hand. Would be happy to be corrected.) Rodgers seems to be taking the same approach, which bodes well for the club's long term future.

true,Azemarus,null,null,"I think many people don't seem to get how this episode changes Doctor Who to its core. It's about how the Doctor thinks. When we meet him in ""An Unearthly Child"" he essentially ran away from his own people and he spends most of the Classic Series running away from Gallifrey. Every interaction on the planet is cut short by the Doctor refusing to consider himself a part of those old and boring TImelords vowed never to interfere. To the point that he drops his responsibilities as President in favour of his life as a wanderer.

What defines the Doctor is that he's always running. In the new series we see him running away from something else, there are no Timelords to run away from, instead he runs away from what he did. That's what the War-Doctor represents. He runs away from the darkness within himself, the actions he took in the past.

If you watch Night of the Doctor, 8 was ignorig the War, deciding to stay out of it. He dealt with the war by becoming someone other than the Doctor, because he knew the Doctor would never have the ability to end a war. 

The concept of running away especially came into play with the Eleventh Doctor. When his death came he spent years wandering the universe before finally accepting that he had to die. Then there was Trenzalore to run away from (which he essentially still is).

But here's where the 50th threw him for a loop. He was plucked from time and confronted with the man he'd never want to be again. The War Doctor. He had to deal with the fact that this figure was him. He spends an entire episode refusing to do that until he and Ten arrive on Gallifrey in their Tardises.

To quote Ten: ""You were the Doctor more than any of us. You did what you had to do when there was no getting it right.""

Eleven placing his hand on that button again, is him accepting that he's capable of doing that. It's not an alter-ego, it's not the potion of Karn that made him do this, he did this because there was no alternative and after 400 years he proves that he's still the same man and would still make that decision.

Clara made him doubt that statement. Made him remember what he stands for. He is still a dark man capable of this horrible act, but now he realizes that he doesn't have to.

The end of the episode is the relief that he did the right thing after all. He has a goal. He's no longer running away from Gallifrey, running away from his own actions, he has a goal: he's going home.


The search for Gallifrey can provide many stories and I'm sure it will be a while until he finds his home. I just think the essential change in his arch, is that he's no longer running. Look back at the archs that Moffat set up in these past few years. They all include a threat the Doctor hides from.

I hope this change will be obvious in the next episode. It could be done in a very simple way: he chooses to go to Trenzalore as opposed to not having a choice. ",0,1385648661,null,0,false,0,cdox4zr,t3_1rlzok,t1_cdox4zr,t3_1rlzok,null,1428475436,12,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,12

&gt; I like what Neil Gaiman said on the topic (from his tumblr when someone asked if the War Doctor considered canonical as the ninth doctor)

&gt; I don’t really understand the question. I’m tempted to say something like, “No, the John Hurt War Doctor is just something that happened in THE NAME OF THE DOCTOR, THE NIGHT OF THE DOCTOR and THE DAY OF THE DOCTOR on television.”

&gt; If it happens on the TV, it’s canonical, unless it isn’t. (For example, no-one seems entirely sure whether we get to see pre-Hartnell regenerations during the mindbending battles of Brain of Morbius.)

&gt; We now know there was a regeneration between the Paul McGann Eighth Doctor and the Chris Ecclestone Ninth Doctor, one whom the Doctor himself has only just begun to regard as being The Doctor (as opposed to being something else).

&gt; If you mean, “Do we now all have to agree to renumber all the Doctors?”, I think the main purpose of numbering things is to communicate, and we all know who we mean when we say Doctors NIne, Ten or Eleven. If anyone corrects you and says “You mean TWELFTH!” when you say “Matt Smith was the eleventh Doctor” then that person is being irritatingly pedantic and should be pitied, in a nice way and with a gentle friendly, not-patronising sort of love, because they will have long hard lives ahead of them.

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"so likewise you recognise that your belief that it is wrong is as equal and valid as someone who says it is right/good? 

&gt; what do you mean by 'wrong' in this case?

unjust, dishonest, or immoral.

&gt; do you believe all morality is objective, or is some of it subjective? if the later, where are the lines drawn?

you misunderstand what objective morality means. if there is objective morality, then every moral action exists on an objective 'scorecard', making something like child rape 'less moral' than feeding the hungry.

it does not mean that any persons 'morality' (as in their personal moral code) would be objective. 

&gt; if you believe some moral positions are subjective, do you then believe all opinions on such matters are equal (which your post above suggests you would)

no, and I do not believe in subjective morality. I recognise that people have different opinions about what is right and wrong, but I do not concede that this means there is no such thing as right and wrong. however I recognise that if there were no such thing as objective morality, then indeed all opinions on any moral issues would be equal (which is to say, there is no way to be more or less right than anyone about anything; every moral judgement would simply be an expression of personal preference/conditioning)

&gt; if it is objectively morally wrong to do an act, how can such an act occur? how is a child rapist able to believe that what they are doing is acceptable in such a reality?

again, you misunderstand what objective morality means. it doesn't mean that everyone recognises wrong as such, rather it means that there is true right and wrong. it means for example that even though a child rapist thinks he is being moral by raping a child for pleasure, he is actually immoral. people are able to do wrong things for any number of reasons; they are misled, misguided, blinded to the truth. 

&gt; was raping a human child objectively wrong before humans existed? if no, when did it become morally wrong to do so?

the question doesn't make sense. if there's no human child then there can't be such a thing as raping a human child. 

&gt; would it be morally wrong to rape a child, if it meant preventing the otherwise instant deaths of half the population of Earth? how in general does an objective morality deal with such circumstances?

that is not the question I asked; I asked if it was wrong to rape a child for pleasure. but to answer your question, (presuming objective morality exists) then the act of doing something wrong for the greater good would still be wrong, but it would be downgraded on the objective scale of right and wrong for mitigating circumstances, like we do in our justice system. it would still be wrong, but the intention would not be so. (presumably)

&gt; is stoning a women to death objectively wrong?

I don't know; I don't have the objective moral scale, and indeed this is again a misunderstanding of what objective morality is. same for your further 3 questions. 

&gt; how can you(or anyone) be sure of the truth of what they believe to be objectively moral positions when morality is so dependent on historical and cultural setting?

again, I am not saying that what I believe to be objectively moral positions are correct. rather I am advocating objective morality, however hard it may be for humans to access or define this in particular situations. 

it is precisely because human moral views shift throughout history that objective morality is such an important concept. if there is objective morality, it would not mean ignoring historical or cultural settings. rather it would take all of those into account and then (be able to) make ultimate judgements on specific actions in specific contexts. so we could say that, for example, certain categories of actions are not always wrong throughout history, but for example, raping a child for pleasure is not right now and never was, throughout history.",0,1385649883,null,0,false,0,cdoxf0b,t3_1rkctg,t1_cdoxf0b,t1_cdowv2z,null,1428475306,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

You cannot argue that people elect a PM as *de facto* , because it isn't always accepted as being the primary cause of voting behavior. People vote for complex reasons, just as strong an argument can be made for the fact that people vote for party loyalties above and beyond whoever leads the party, as can be made for the people voting for a person as leader of the party. 

That's not the system however, the system elects MPs and they select their party leader as PM. Thus there is no such thing as an ""unelected PM"". It's spurious nonsense and has been since the Parliament Act gave supremacy to the Commons. This is fact. 

On top of that the constitution is based on law and precedent or custom. There is no precedent for the PM *having to be* elected to become PM. There is precedent for the majority party being offered the choice of PM and that MP being the leader of their party.  It's not even customary, or else Home would have followed Eden in declaring an election immediately on taking office, as well as john Major. 

Event the latest changes to the Parliament act, and the coalition agreement steer well clear of committing the any party having to hold an election if the leader resigns or is changed.

We are wealthy **because** they are poor. For them to be wealthy too would mean us giving up a massive chunk of our wealth. Personally I believe we should do this - you may very well disagree - that's all fine and open for debate.

The mechanics of global capital however are not open for debate - they operate down very strict, very clear, well defined lines - ones which you seem to be ignoring or perhaps are unaware of?

I went to a low ranking state school, and state schools are bad because too many children from nonacademic homes are in classes with teachers that often aren't up to scratch. They're not designed to be bad, but equally they're not designed to be figuratively bomb proof.

You can't put 30 children in a class, most of whom really don't want to be there because they haven't learnt to enjoy learning, and then give them an alright, but not great teacher, and expect them to take much away from an hour's lesson, which is more like 45 minutes by the time it starts.

What it would take to dramatically improve state schools would be staggering. I think realistically we'd need to halve class sizes.

https://ibwt.co.uk/en/company/funding

Summary;

If you only want to deposit/buy bitcoins, then you self verify (just a registered email), then deposit via hard currency or postal order.

Time to self verify: However long it takes you to check your email.

Time to deposit: 1-3 days, we suggest 1st Class, and a reminder to make sure its recorded delivery and suitable cover for the amount you wish to deposit - https://ibwt.co.uk/en/company/funding (click 'Price Finder' or 'Postal Orders').

Though visually there are not many orders on the trade windows, there are definitely people ready to sell via the platform.

Bonuses to using IBWT - No transfer fee, no exchange rate fee, less verification, faster, and currently VASTLY cheaper than the other UK means (don't expect that to stay though, traders put their own prices up). And very secure. IBWT uses enforced 2fa (email totp), offers 3fa (google authenticator), and uses 2fa (email) for Bitcoin and Litecoin withdrawal. And once you have Bitcoins on the IBWT platform its far easier and faster to acquire Litecoins (if you so wish), though again, because of recently re-launched, low of quantity, at the moment.

edit: Also, impossible for customers to have transaction freezes or bank account closures.

No the government grants power they would not normally have in a free market. That's why they spend billions on lobbying.

As someone who has lived in a real 100% capitalist society I can tell you the hospital will not let anyone die. They all get left money by rich old people after they have received good care. This money is placed in a fund to pay for people who can't afford treatment. The fund is so big it won't run out of money. The hospital will look the other way on small things the fund only covers major stuff.

That's a charity. Charity often do better then the government. See also scholarships and bursaries.

The market will fill these gaps. Firms will fill these gaps. Makes them look good.

Steven Moffat has severe problems writing women, which has only become more apparent as he took over as showrunner. His female characters are pretty much all clones of each other: sassy, flirty, action girls. They frequently have no agency or development; their ""choices"" are the result not of who they are but of what the plot requires. When what they do (or what is done to them) should have severe repercussions, it is often handwaved away, with no change to their personality or behavior after.

Just because the women in your stories aren't meek, deferential homemakers doesn't make them *not* caricatures. If your idea of writing a ""real"" woman is simply to reverse a bunch of stereotypes, and then you keep doing that with every other woman, you're writing characters just as false.

**Homophobia:**

I don't think this is exactly the right word. What I'm assuming people are getting at here is that Moffat doesn't write LGB characters where their orientation (a) fundamentally informs who they are ***and*** (b) isn't constantly leaned on as a humor button/quirk with no further implications. Everything is tossed off as a one-liner and then never addressed or seen (River, Canton) or constantly slyly referenced (Vastra &amp; Jenny).

As with his portrayal of women, it's an oversimplified view of same-sex relationships that seems more for the sake of including them than because Moffat understands that orientation is another facet of humanity—one that can have severe consequences for people who chose to acknowledge if theirs goes against cultural norms of their time, as it would for Vastra &amp; Jenny.",0,1385653229,null,0,false,0,cdoyal9,t3_1rmbw0,t1_cdoyal9,t1_cdosi7f,null,1428474897,14,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,14

That isn't because I'm an idiot, it's because I don't have much of an interest in watching those programs on TV. Occasionally I will watch about deep sea exploration because that is like seeing another world. Most documentaries I enjoy watching regard physics and space exploration, otherwise its comedies and football for me on TV. Then Netflix and whatever the internet has to offer.

Though I don't know what kind of point you are making, even if i had glanced at a david attenborough program on discovery... I would have to pay double or even triple times for that? I pay for a licence just to legally use Sky TV, I then pay for Sky TV and then pay for the discovery package. So Discovery have to pay BBC for the rights to air that program on pay to view so? In effect, I'm contributing more to the BBC than non satellite/cable subscribers but personally getting very little out of it.

Not all of us sit in front of a TV for hours on end, I barely watch that thing as its mostly for my xbox so I have absolutely no use for all the drama BBC produces or repeats of panel shows including Mock the Week from 4-5 years ago. I can't even recall the last time my Sky box had BBC on, seeing as the box restarts on like channel 975 or whatever now.

Sounds about right.

Real IQ test are scored based on age. That how you get some young kids with crazy IQ numbers. Anything else would not be fair. 

I'm in the 98th percentile. Want to know how you know someone has a high IQ? They will tell you...

High IQ is actually very frustrating. You want everything to be logical. Most things are not logical. Average IQ is 80-100 lawyers and high level office workers are 100-120. For lack of a better term 60 is a retard. So the difference between a retard and normal person is 20-40 points. If you are 120-140 talking to normal people is basically the same thing as them trying to talk to a retard. 

TL;DR: Having a high IQ is like living in a world full of retards.  

PS: Any who says they are a member of Mensa is not Mensa is a bunch of people with Asperger syndrome. Who play games they invented in order to have an intelligence dick messuring contest. Though Asperger syndrome may be caused by extreme intelligence to the point of not being able to deal with or relate to reality / society. Think like Sheldon from Big Bang Theory.

I'm leaning towards being the real ""War Doctor"".

Ten specifically says he avoided changing forms only because he was able to shunt the excess energy that would have regenerated him into his hand.  

Then you need to consider [50th Spoiler](#s ""the 13 Doctors showing up.  Having a War Doctor messes up the symbolism of that moment once you know what is coming up.  Combine with it the Moment taking Rose's form, specifically mentioning the Bad Wolf incarnation which was an Eccleston thing."")

Due to the chronology of Eccleston turning down his role then the temporally displaced Doctor leaks started.  Add to it that spoiler.  I think Moffat wanted Eccleston to be the War Doctor, and the War Doctor was a patch job.

&gt;Ding dong! Marx is dead. Ding dong! communism’s dead. Ding dong! socialism’s dead! Ding dong! Clause Four is dead, and it is not coming back.

&gt;Like it or not, the free market economy is the only show in town. Britain is competing in an increasingly impatient and globalised economy, in which the competition is getting ever stiffer.

&gt;No one can ignore the harshness of that competition, or the inequality that it inevitably accentuates; and I am afraid that violent economic centrifuge is operating on human beings who are already very far from equal in raw ability, if not spiritual worth.

&gt;Whatever you may think of the value of IQ tests, it is surely relevant to a conversation about equality that as many as 16 per cent of our species have an IQ below 85, while about 2 per cent have an IQ above 130. The harder you shake the pack, the easier it will be for some cornflakes to get to the top.

&gt;And for one reason or another – boardroom greed or, as I am assured, the natural and god-given talent of boardroom inhabitants - the income gap between the top cornflakes and the bottom cornflakes is getting wider than ever.

Conventional wingers are no good to us as we either don't get enough goalscoring players in the box to finish off crosses or we'd have to play two strikers and get dicked in midfield.

Tell the wide forwards to first and foremost be looking to get played in behind the opposition defence or support Soldado and to stop piss-arse fucking around short and wide of their defence. Fine if Lamela or Townsend want to outpace their marker, skip through three tackles and mug off the keeper then that's awesome but it cant be plan A all the time. It just ends up with a lot of play in front of the defence and a thousand hopeful long shot's when the wide men eventually run in to dead end.

Push the wide forwards up the pitch as 2nd and 3rd strikers when we have the ball. With them supporting the striker let the no.10 come deeper to add passing skills to our build up play. Free up the other midfielder (Paulinho/Dembele) to get up the pitch and join the no.10 in attacks, have a DM (Sandro/Capoue) sit and cover to allow all this. Tell the wingbacks to push up and take the creative burden off of the wide forwards. Don't play slow defenders who can't cope when the wingbacks get a tad exposed up the pitch.

That's not what I meant. I just don't get why Tottenham fans are acting like everyone going against them only happens to them. I don't get this. 

Also, it's really NOT right for you to just simplify the situation after the loss to Villa. 

This wasn't the frustration from one loss, this wasn't a frustration faced through the whole summer, it was a complete melt down shown by the supporters through the frustration that they've built up for YEARS!

If anything it's mostly everyone else except Arsenal fans who keep saying Arsenal isn't a big club.

Anytime you mention Arsenal is a big club, you get downvoted. 
Most fans realize what a big club Arsenal is and a lot of the frustration stemmed from that as well. Seeing a club of Arsenal's stature loosing to the liked of Blackburn, going through an 8-2 loss, not getting players to show ambition, etc. Also doesn't help that the fans are paying a shite load of money to see their club do shit. 

Anyways back to my point, it may feel like everyone's against you but every club that's popular goes through that shit. You may not be acting like it, but a lot of you Spurs fans are.

They could buy the £7,560 of debt for £504 (which is what the government is selling it at) and then write it off the remaining 'debt/profit'. They would save £7,056 each!

I think that depends greatly on what side of the fence you sit on.

I don't believe anyone's out to get cyclists (as such) but I think on a sub conscious level many papers (the best worst example) know that cyclists piss drivers off (for all sorts of reasons) and cyclists make up only 2% of traffic. As you said earler they know their market, and its easy pickings.

But this kinda proves the point I think.

http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1rn1ro/hit_and_run_cyclist_who_left_girl_9_fighting_for/cdovsgs

if you take those examples, and add cyclist to it I think it would be fair to say the comments sections of those papers would be full of ""get cyclists off the roads"" sorta comments.

As it is I bet most, if not all of the comments will criticize the driver and not drivers as a whole. 


&gt;arguement so far has seemed a lot more confrontational and irrational

I think part of the problem is (Im guilty of this) the vulnerability factor. Many cyclists are always having to defend themselves against generalizations and dangers. And I suppose with that in mind many cyclists have to shout quite loudly to be heard.

But of course this has a negative knock on effect - angry cyclists is the result. There usually not angry at other times.

&gt;I do agree that our current infrastrucutre is not built for cyclists... but I think (and I'm having a brainwave here, for me at least) that cyclists are wrong to attack motorists - they're not the enemy - but should attack the government instead.

I think me and you may have discussed something similar before - But im not in the attack motorists by default camp (im a motorist, my wife and friends are too). I just object to bull shit attitude that might put me in danger. And I honestly don't care if Im the most hated road user, just as long as my life's not compromised.

Which leads to the problem - the only people who kill cyclists are cyclists and drivers. But an aware, brilliantly trained cyclist can be killed with relative easy by a small mistake by driver. That problem does not exist the other way round.

I have similar opinion with HGV driver - Its incorrect and wrong to assume they are killing cyclists for shits and giggles. The issue is a much bigger problem. But again its only the cyclists getting killed. 


&gt;Not in an irrational way - but how is the average driver going to change the road layout? All they can change is their driving style - which is a start - but is a patch for the problem, not a true cure.

This is a major problem. Many campaigning cyclists are split. Some think nothing but better design and cycle paths (that work) are the answer. Other think cyclists should stick to the roads and driver should be tamed. The issue with both of those problems is nether is a quick fix -  and both are seen as an attack on motorists.

But looking on the bright side - things are changing for the better (well if you're a cyclist that is). There's allot of national campaigning going on. Not just cycling campaigning and indirect cycling campaigns going on that will raise awareness and safety for everyone. 


&gt;I agree with you - and yet I've seen idiots hitting 15/20+MPH on busy pavements. I've seen an old man physically hold the handlebars of a teenage cyclist to prevent him cycling off among the elderly and pram users in the middle of a shopping precinct.

Yep - that's a prefect example with the problem of cycling - But that's also a problem with driving. The issues are the idiots not the mode of transport.


Ill happily admit that many cyclists (saw one last night) will break the law for nothing more than connivance. But again, so will drivers... And im not excusing either. Infact if anything Im say motorists and cyclists mentality is closer than the media and the general population think.


&gt;Lastly... I think beyond that we do agree. This is a weird one for me. I've 'chatted' to a couple of other cyclists on here and it felt like a waste of time but not here. So... thanks :)

Its been nice chatting with you - and likewise :)

In my opinion, no.

&gt; or in other words, can the opinion of a child rapist be as equally valid as yours on this point? why or why not?

Depends on what you mean by validity.

&gt; firstly you misunderstand what objective morality means; it doesn't mean that any specific actions are always 'right' or 'wrong'; rather it means that ultimately all actions can exist on an objective and fixed scale of morality.

So where does rape (either ordered by god or not) sit on this scale?

Tomb of the Cybermen - very good episode with Cybermen

The Web of Fear - first surviving episode with the great intelligence

The War Games - Troughton's regen and first appearance of the Time Lords 

Spearhead from space - colour and Autons first

Terror of the Autons - First episodes with the Master

The Three Doctors - First multi doctor serial and Omega one of the founders of time lord society (might want to watch more episodes to know the characters of the Doctors. Use this list to find interesting oneshttp://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/index.shtml )

The Time warrior - first appearance of the sontarans

Genesis of the Daleks - Origin of the dales and first with Davros examines allegory behind the daleks 

Terror of the Zygons - First appearance of the Zygons

Brain of Morbius - Sisterhood of Karn and some Time lord criminals and such

The Deadly Assassin - only episode without a companion and first entirely set on Gallifrey

Horror of Fang rock - First and only appearance (so far) of the Rutans the Sontaran's opponents 

Invasion of Time - another episode set on Gallifrey with more mythos

The Key To Time - the fist major series arc with some mythos and his first Time Lady companion

City of Death - Douglas Adams and Doctor Who as well as second incarnation of his Time Lady companion 

The Arc of Infinity - Omega's return and some Time Lord mythos

The Five doctors - the first five Doctors interact and Rassilon founder of Time Lord society ( completely different to the insane one in the End of Time and IMO better as a reluctant immortal)

Caves of Androzani - Brilliant and Doctor sacrifices himself for his companion

Trial of a Timelord - second series arc and time lord politics and mythos

Rememberance of the Daleks - mythos and daleks flying for the first time

Curse of Fenric - Manipulative doctor manifests himself and very good episode

Survival - Final episode of the Classic series 

The Tv Movie - 8's only appearance but mostly not great


This list is far from conclusive and all episodes had parts which added to the mythos and the Doctor's character. Also these episodes are significant but not necessarily the best( some are e.g. Genesis of the Daleks, City of Death, Caves of Androzani, and Tomb of the Cybermen) look and see which episodes have bits which interest you in concept or design or setting etc. Use the list in the bit under the Three Doctors to search through them.)

When I left school, all I wanted to be was a full time mountaineer - certainly nothing to do with being in doors or in an office all day.  I worked as a self employed climbing instructor for a few years, did 18 months as an overland driver, taking punters in a truck from London to Capetown in my mid 20's.  By my late 20's I was more or less a full time running expeditions for other people on a self employed basis to the Himalaya / Karakorum and the more empty bits of the Middle East and Africa.  In the mid 90's I got an opportunity to start a business running driver / expedition training for geologists working in the oil industry, and from there it was a short step to starting another company running 4x4 expeditions and logistics round the Sahara.  

This all started to wind down by about 2005 after Bush and Blair started poking a stick at the crazy's and all the venues started to look a bit sketchy.  I had been involved with wed development for years and doing quite a bit of programming as a freelancer so started my first design company with a partner in 2002  which ran along side the expedition stuff - that lasted a few years until I dropped out of that company and started up on my own basically supplying back end development to other web agencies. 

I'm basically completely unemployable and have no idea what I should do with myself on a long term basis - hence always doing it for myself and finding gainful employment that way.

So I've been occasionally mirroring the sort of snobbery I take issue with, to see how it is received by British redditors. I started a couple of weeks ago, outlining my plan [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/britishproblems/comments/1qokn4/its_nearly_december_radio_stations_will_soon_be/cdf1pvu). My [initial test](http://www.reddit.com/r/britishproblems/comments/1qokn4/its_nearly_december_radio_stations_will_soon_be/cdey7jt) was indeed upvoted, which I found rather disheartening, as it is the kind of snobbery I feared may be prevalent among British redditors.

You have to look at the events of DotD as occurring in Eleven's timeline.

true,JamesB5446,cnty-scotland,Cleethorpes,"&gt; So they sent twelve thousand warriors to Jabesh-gilead with orders to kill everyone there, including women and children.  ""This is what you are to do,"" they said. ""Completely destroy all the males and every woman who is not a virgin.""  Among the residents of Jabesh-gilead they found four hundred young virgins who had never slept with a man, and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh in the land of Canaan.
 The Israelite assembly sent a peace delegation to the little remnant of Benjamin who were living at the rock of Rimmon. Then the men of Benjamin returned to their homes, and the four hundred women of Jabesh-gilead who were spared were given to them as wives.  But there were not enough women for all of them.  The people felt sorry for Benjamin because the LORD had left this gap in the tribes of Israel.  So the Israelite leaders asked, ""How can we find wives for the few who remain, since all the women of the tribe of Benjamin are dead?  There must be heirs for the survivors so that an entire tribe of Israel will not be lost forever.  But we cannot give them our own daughters in marriage because we have sworn with a solemn oath that anyone who does this will fall under God's curse.""
 Then they thought of the annual festival of the LORD held in Shiloh, between Lebonah and Bethel, along the east side of the road that goes from Bethel to Shechem.  They told the men of Benjamin who still needed wives, ""Go and hide in the vineyards.  When the women of Shiloh come out for their dances, rush out from the vineyards, and each of you can take one of them home to be your wife!  And when their fathers and brothers come to us in protest, we will tell them, 'Please be understanding.  Let them have your daughters, for we didn't find enough wives for them when we destroyed Jabesh-gilead. And you are not guilty of breaking the vow since you did not give your daughters in marriage to them.'""  So the men of Benjamin did as they were told.  They kidnapped the women who took part in the celebration and carried them off to the land of their own inheritance.  Then they rebuilt their towns and lived in them.  So the assembly of Israel departed by tribes and families, and they returned to their own homes.


&gt; They attacked Midian just as the LORD had commanded Moses, and they killed all the men.  All five of the Midianite kings – Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba – died in the battle.  They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword.  Then the Israelite army captured the Midianite women and children and seized their cattle and flocks and all their wealth as plunder.  They burned all the towns and villages where the Midianites had lived.  After they had gathered the plunder and captives, both people and animals, they brought them all to Moses and Eleazar the priest, and to the whole community of Israel, which was camped on the plains of Moab beside the Jordan River, across from Jericho.
 Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the people went to meet them outside the camp.  But Moses was furious with all the military commanders who had returned from the battle.  ""Why have you let all the women live?"" he demanded.  ""These are the very ones who followed Balaam's advice and caused the people of Israel to rebel against the LORD at Mount Peor.  They are the ones who caused the plague to strike the LORD's people.  Now kill all the boys and all the women who have slept with a man.  Only the young girls who are virgins may live; you may keep them for yourselves.

&gt; As you approach a town to attack it, first offer its people terms for peace.  If they accept your terms and open the gates to you, then all the people inside will serve you in forced labor.  But if they refuse to make peace and prepare to fight, you must attack the town.  When the LORD your God hands it over to you, kill every man in the town.  But you may keep for yourselves all the women, children, livestock, and other plunder.  You may enjoy the spoils of your enemies that the LORD your God has given you.

He said that he reckoned the crew of the boat would have about an hour to live since the opposition would track the source of the warhead we fired, then send a counter warhead. In the space of an hour you would be able to get at best 15 to 25 nautical miles from your original position so you would be dead meat.

I'm not sure how true that is or how accurately people are able to track the source of a nuclear warhead but it might be true.

So you would imagine the idea would be to fire as many of your missiles as possible as quickly as possible before you can be retaliated against. This would just increase the accuracy of the bullseye you are creating on yourself though I guess.

It's interesting, when a V boat is deployed and they perform their regular drills of firing a nuclear warhead, only a few of the officers are aware it is a drill.

Only if you're buying something from another country. If its nationally, the vat's already added on, where it needs to be paid.

So, if you're paying in Bitcoin, the value you're paying at, say, a car at £20,000 (vat included), then you would be paying £20,000 worth of bitcoin, (lets say 1 btc = £1,000, so 20 Bitcoins).

However, lets say that you brought 100 Bitcoins some time ago for £200.

You've still got 80 bitcoins (£80,000), you've brought your car, you've paid the vat on it (it was included). This occurs because Bitcoins as of themselves are not recognized as a currency.

However!

If suddenly you have shiny new car, new other stuff, etc, and the hmrc man pops round, he's gonna get funny ideas about what you've been doing, and the one knocking at your door has probably never heard of bitcoin before :D

You still don't owe any extra tax though, you paid it when you brought the car. The car sales man would have converted it straight away, or kept some as bitcoin for a little while whilst it rose in value and then converted the = amount of £20,000 to £ and submitted the VAT. 

You'll have to explain to the hmrc man about bitcoin and that you're not secretly a drug lord or something else silly ;)

They clashed on ideas all the time but it was nothing major..sort of what you'd expect from any 2 authoritative managers, but I get the vibe that BR used to get annoyed when he'd give an order and frank would disagree and then Borrell would side with Frank on opposing ideas (maybe because he agreed or maybe to be stubborn and keep the balance of power) and to a degree outrule BR's decisions.

I think we've been really lucky with our previous managers so the next one is bound to struggle. I think he'll have difficultly with rebuilding the squad (he'll no doubt complain about the limited budget and high price of players) and the inevitable slide towards relegation will begin.

Despite all this... with our relatively good finances and recent investments around the ground/training facilities etc... we'll end up stabilising as a good mid-table Championship team for the longer term.

true,BitcoinJobe,,IBWT.co.uk - UK Exchange,"IBWT has only been re-launched for just over a week, and we did not have a large capital funding to boost initial liquidity, we're instead relying upon customer interest and the service we provide to boost liquidity and early growth.

It will come, just will take a little bit of time and interested customers. Minimum deposits are as low as £5 to encourage customers to try our services out, and you can of course deposit bitcoin or litecoins to experiment on the platform straight away.

The values are low at the moment because there is more trading on the other methods/sites for GBP, and with that those sites are chasing the market average much easier. Think of it as an opportunity to get some cheap Bitcoins and try out a new exchange in the process, a kind of promotional. The cheap coins will quickly disappear IBWT starts getting used more and people realise the viability.

And we're able to provide easier access to Bitcoins in the UK because, quite frankly, Satoshi was a genius.

For more details please check our resources page, and the following 2 pdfs, https://ibwt.co.uk/files/HMRC.pdf, https://ibwt.co.uk/files/25-10-2013-FCA.pdf

TL;DR - Because its currently impossible to register as an MSB in the UK, no Exchange (dealing with decentralised crypto currencies) is regulated. And, especially because the IBWT model does not use a bank, no banking criteria to be sub-servient to.

I do kind of see a lot of the other exchanges as mirrors of the banks, with the amount of verification required. And that 'moving' to bitcoin, yet still requiring a bank is only stepping halfway out of the 'box', to fully step out of the model they created to instill a society dependent upon them (the banks) you need to be able to step fully away from them. Otherwise they will always have power over you.

The UK government has allowed Bitcoin the opportunity to flourish, and we (IBWT) are thankful and will enjoy that opportunity whilst we can. I am sure that regulations in the UK will most definitely be coming in due time, when that happens, it is very likely that we (IBWT) will be forced into changing our business model to accommodate any changes.",0,1385667333,null,0,1385667823,0,cdp3ape,t3_1rm5c7,t1_cdp3ape,t3_1rm5c7,null,1428472491,1,false,BitcoinUK,t5_2wq3q,1

true,PaywallBot,null,null,"&gt;Four cities Down Under make it into the top 10 most popular destinations for Brits to move to with family-friendly Perth taking top spot, according to a survey by MoveHub.com , an online marketplace for expats.
&gt;
&gt;Perth, on the west coast of Australia, enjoys good beaches and a world-class zoo and aquarium. Most people work in mining, agricultural or public administration roles.
&gt;
&gt;Sydney and Melbourne came second and third on the list.
&gt;
&gt;""Most of the expats we deal with are businessmen and their families. Australia’s growing resources and services sector means more and more people are looking to move there for work from the UK,"" said MoveHub spokesman Max Holloway.
&gt;
&gt;The rest of the cities making up the top 10 are Dubai, which has climbed up the rankings since 2012, Auckland, Cape Town, Brisbane, Singapore, Berlin and Toronto.
&gt;
&gt;Dropping off the list for the first time is New York, which was placed second last year. Hong Kong also dropped out of the top 10 this year. MoveHub expects Sao Paulo to sneak in or near the top 10 next year, as the heart of the Brazilian economy, along with the Middle Eastern cities of Doha and Oman.
&gt;
&gt;Lagos is also predicted to feature, according to Mr Holloway, with workers likely to be lured by tempting salaries paid to expatriates employed in the Nigerian oil and gas industries.
&gt;
&gt;He added: ""We don’t really know why people seemed less interested in moving to New York and Hong Kong, but it may well be to do with increasing property prices. Non-residents in Hong Kong have to pay a staggering 25 per cent of the property's price on top of the deal value and New York isn’t exactly known for its cheap property prices.""
&gt;
&gt;Rob O’Brien is a Briton who spent eight years living in Sydney before relocating to Singapore three years ago.
&gt;
&gt;He said of his adopted home – which came eighth on the list: ""Singapore is a very dynamic city and I feel it has lots of opportunities. There is so much potential here to start your own business, expand and meet people from around the world.""
&gt;
&gt;While he enjoyed his time in Australia, the distance from the UK was an issue. ""Singapore is a lot closer to home so that was a factor when I decided to relocate. I’m keen on hanging around here,"" said Mr O'Brien.
&gt;
&gt;A large number of Britons who are thinking of relocating are over-50s. Almost half of UK residents in that age group are tempted to move abroad in retirement, with the cost of living the primary motivation, according to a recent survey from financial advice group deVere.
&gt;
&gt;The poll revealed that the over-50s have concerns about retiring in the UK due to the standard of care for the elderly, quality of life and the weather.

You say they can't just rustle up a treaty, why not? If you study international law (i have) you'd realise you can make a treaty on just about anything. The oil is in Scotland's control (well 90% of it) based purely on a very strict interpretation of laws on global commons. If we assume this is true, why can Scotland not agree to a treaty giving rights to that oil indefinitely or for a number of years? The answer is of course they can. China gave Hong Kong to Britain for 100 years back in 1899 and that's a city full of people.

Plenty of triangles that can be used to our advantage for both attacking and defending. I prefer Torres playing slightly behind with Schurrle being higher. The offensive formation is weak on the right side defensively, but this would be used in an all or nothing fashion.

For a 4-2-3-1 without Mata, I'd use Luiz with Mikel staying back and Eto instead of Torres pushing up.

But the PP decided that because it was from the PSOE national government, and while the regions have to implement the national law, they can interpret it as they like. So they decided to make it so that this subject *must* be taught in English. And sending inspectors to make sure that it is.

Spain isn't like Scandinavia or the Netherlands, outside of holiday destinations, people don't generally speak English. Not only that, it wasn't the English teachers that had to teach it, it was the Social Sciences teachers.

I explained the various reasons why in the above linked thread (I don't want to spam this subreddit, I feel like I am already)

Basically - relaunched just over 1 week ago, low on traders at the moment, traders are coming, and more will come over time, but we need time to grow. It will be a few weeks, maybe longer, before we have heavy trading, it all depends on customers willing to use the IBWT platform and spread the good word of our reliability and ease of use. 

We have not seeded the exchange with a large capital infusion, but are seeking to gain the initial customers/traders by our ease of services. The current cheap coins won't last long as traders start using the platform, and then IBWT will get more aligned with the other methods/exchanges of acquiring bitcoin (and litecoin).

Sellers attract buyers, and buyers attract sellers, and both attract businesses. And we have a fair few things planned for future development. But only with time and customer interest will we get there.

edit: its a min deposit of £5, postal orders also (but you must pay royal mail fees, please check the platform for more details).

true,confusedpublic,null,null,"&gt;I disagree that the academy has been the pipeline of great players that is portrayed in the article. No-one has made it to the first the and stuck there for years since Gerrard and crew. That's an awful shame given the Shankly legacy of building the club's strength from within.

The article makes the point that the academy is *only just* starting to come good, and hasn't for 20 years.

Here's the passages that claim it hasn't produced anything:

&gt;Concern lies in the decision to get rid of McParland and Borrell at a time when Liverpool's youth setup appeared to be functioning better than had been the case for close to 20 years …

&gt;McParland, Borrell and former technical director Pep Segura themselves arrived at Liverpool's academy in 2009 as part of a major overhaul, instigated by the manager Rafael Benítez who, despite the club's success in the Youth Cup finals of 2006 and 2007, did not believe the youth setup was delivering the required results, seen by the fact that since Gerrard's first-team debut in November 1998, no other homegrown player had shown the necessary talent and temperament to establish themselves at that level.

And here's the passage that claims it's only just starting to come good after the changes Rafa instigated:

&gt;Those changes may not yet have delivered another bona fide star, but there can be little doubt they are having an effect given six academy players made their first-team debuts last season

Nearly all of the players in that list are 18-19. It'd ridiculous to think that they should have cemented any place in the first time at that age. Kelly is the oldest of the bunch, but he's had some horrible luck with injuries and has barely played in the last two seasons, but he was certainly a good first team/squad player when he was fit.

Some people can't do some things.  It's not a sentiment born of insult or dismissiveness, it's just a simple fact.

And actually acknowledging this fact would help a lot in pushing to stop menial jobs disappearing because the fact is some people *are* only capable of doing menial jobs with any competence.

Eg: I can't cook for shit, so if the system expected me to cook to be able to have a job I'd be screwed.  Only by accepting that some people don't have the ability to do certain things can we develop the right systems for a mature and efficient society and economy.

Also don't overlook Iceland, their veg may be frozen but it's still good veg and at a very cheap price.

Pasta is pasta, there is very little seperating the brands from the own brands.

Also, Tomato puree is your friend. It contains a far greater amount of tomato than tins or even fresh. Just a large spoonful is one of your 5 a day. Use it to thicken out and flavour curries, chillis, pasta and spaghetti dishes.

Where was the costing and finance?  

""This arrangement would benefit the UK just as much as Scotland.""  Sorry, but the White Paper is nothing short of a partisan SNP manifesto, not a White Paper for independence, and saying the UK will do this because it's good for them is conjecture, and not one that's being shared.

There's a real need for a 'wake up and smell the coffee' moment, not that it'll be a popular sentiment.  Of course Scotland is more than capable of becoming independent but they're selling the proverbial 'pig in a poke' if they think that the UK is going to share a joint currency, with equal policy decisions, with what would be a junior foreign partner.  Or to assume that the UK will be happy to continue a mutual energy network so the UK can meet carbon targets.   They may well buy Scottish energy much as they may do with other countries, but they're not going to subsidise Scottish generation to buy it back which is what the SNP has argued in the White Paper. 

There's a lot of what the rUK will do, and they'll do it because we think it's good for them.  There's little evidence to show that it will be met that way.   If this is the final White Paper then there's a lot of growing up still to be done.  Of course Scotland is more than capable of being independent and making it work, if they so wish, but on the evidence of it then the SNP aren't up to the task - or they're not being honest to the Scottish people about it, and they deserve that much.

I mean what can Scotland really do if the UK just put the Royal Navy in the North Sea and said Scotland wasn't having any of the oil? Firstly it would have to take the UK to an international court, which the UK can just flat out refuse to do. Even if, for some reason, the UK agreed to go to an international court, Scotland would then have to spend millions are arguing to get back it's oil, which isn't even a certain outcome as a country peacefully splitting from it's parent country, then claiming offshore resources already claimed and used by the existing country is without precedent. It would take YEARS to even get to court never mind get a resolution.

By the time a resolution was had, chances are the UK will have run off with a shit ton of oil (as it could just encourage companies to increase production) and oil may even be just about ready to be replaced as a stable fossil fuel.

The only thing Scotland could potentially do is say ""Well we refuse to have any of your debt"" in which case the UK can take all the oil (even if it's just to argue until Scotland has paid for it's national debt) what can Scotland actually do to stop it?

Nothing, Alex Salmond keeps making these statements about what will happen and wont happened as if Scotland has any say in it. Fuck, the UK may not have any say in it if Spain vetos Scotland joining the EU.

Taking out the people who aren't due to pay, and assuming that every missing graduate would get in touch with the SLC if this offer was made to pay off the debt cheaply, we'd still need to raise most of the £160m from people who owe a total of around £400m.

But the actor reportedly made his feelings a little clearer in 2011, during an acting workshop at the Theatre Royal Haymarket. According to the BadWilf blog, when asked why he left the role Eccleston replied: ‘I left Doctor Who because I could not get along with the senior people. I left because of politics. I did not see eye-to-eye with them. I didn’t agree with the way things were being run. I didn’t like the culture that had grown up around the series.’

Sending large amounts can be expensive in fees however, and we advise customers to consider face to face deposits if travel costs are more viable (contact us via support@ibwt.co.uk). You can also send deposits via postal orders if sending hard currency feels like a security risk (http://www.postoffice.co.uk/postal-orders).

Both linked via our [Funding](https://ibwt.co.uk/en/company/funding)  page.

We fully understand and accept that sending postal orders or hard currency is uncomfortable and feels risky for some. I imagine many of us felt the same feelings when we first heard of Bitcoins. However, the current UK banks (and UK Gov) position on Bitcoin has given us this opportunity to expand into alternative methods of funding. A model that is not prone to transactions being frozen, nor customer bank accounts being closed.

edit: &gt; Can I buy, say, 2 BTC from you? Do you have that much?

You can view the trade windows by clicking the various B &gt; £, B &gt; $, L &gt; £, tabs. There is currently not that much on the order books, please keep in mind that IBWT only re-launched just over 1 week ago, without large capital funding to boost an Exchange's initial liquidity it takes time to attract traders (customers) to generate liquidity. We do plan to continue to attract traders within the UK and internationally (future development), which will boost liquidity.

But to answer your question directly. Traders sell their Bitcoins to you via the IBWT platform. Not IBWT. So IBWT has 0 Bitcoins, and it is anyones guess how many the traders who use the IBWT platform have ready to sell you.

Technically it doesn't mean that the debt is wiped, you still owe the money but it's illegal for them to try to collect it. It's always been a bit unclear whether this applied to student loans, but it appeared that whenever someone claimed their debt was statute-barred, the SLC avoided pressing the issue for fear of creating a precedent and encouraging every other borrower to go silent for six years. This report seems to confirm that approach. I suspect that the £2m figure is people who have actually made that claim and the rest is people who have passed 6 years or soon will, but don't know what that means.

Scotland has nothing to force the UK's hand, realistically think if Catalonia split off from Spain after a referendum and claimed some land belonged to it and Spain said it didn't, and then put guards all long the border. Would the UK invade Spain? Of course not.

Negotiation is all about your bargaining strength, which is determined by what your alternative to negotiation is. Scotland can be denied entry to the EU, making trade and travel between EU members prohibitive, it can be denied the use of the pound, the UK can simply not allow Scotland to take the oil fields that the UK currently controls... What can Scotland do? Not accept responsibility for a portion of national debt.

If Alex Salmond is not an idiot, he will already know all this, and offer the UK a deal that, while it isn't what they want, will be better than the alternative which would cause them difficulties internationally. It would never get to the above as Salmond hopefully isn't stupid enough to see Scotland has no way to force anything.

Seriously, do you honestly think there would be some sort of intervention if the UK simply placed a destroyer on the North Sea oil fields, routed all the oil tanker shipments to England and told Scotland that any ships trespassing in their waters will be dealt with appropriately?

Whenever one of these ""mistaken identity"" cases hits the news, the journos always make strenuous efforts to remind the reader that the ""vigilante"" only attacked the victim because they mistakenly believed him to be a paedophile. The implication being that the wrongdoing lies not in the vicious assault, but in the misplaced target for their wrath. If the victim had been a genuine nonce then justice would have been done and everyone could pat themselves on the back.

The fact of the matter is that the legal status of the victim is immaterial. Regardless of whether he is a paedophile, a murderer, a benefit cheat, an investment banker, innocent of any crime or literally Hitler, we have a justice system in place, one that does not involve violent, dangerous thugs administering beatings. Someone needs to make it clear to Lee James and his ilk that we cannot and will not tolerate violent crime.

Additionally I think it's fairly clear in this case that there was no genuine suspicion; James merely used the accusation to justify his thirst for blood. I would suggest that this is true in the majority of such cases: violent people are compelled to find an outlet for their urges and nobody around them is safe as long as they are allowed to roam free.

What we was trying to say is that how it was against Man City was just an example of how the season has been so far attacking wise for Spurs. The stats we put in speak for themselves. How does a team have more shots per game, than one that almost quadruples them for the amount of goals they have scored.

It's either down to poor finishing, or too many shots from long distance that aren't likely to go in.

The way in which we can see this improving is by using wingers and strikers in the way in which Man City do. We're old school, 2 strikers and fast wingers work...to an extent. Not against everyone, but everyone has different types of players to fill these positions. We know AVB loves the 4-2-3-1 and is unlikely to change, so at least deploy Lennon and Townsend with the number 1 aim to get crosses into the box for Soldado and a joining Paulinho, who by the way can be very effective as we have already seen this season.

Yes Eriksen and Holtby may not be those type of players to break into the box, but as some of you have already pointed out, are essential to a team when wanting to build up play and keep possession.

I'll repeat the sentiment that I expressed when the awful case of [Rachel Ashworth](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2448371/Woman-jailed-organising-beating-man-wrongly-named-paedophile.html) (warning - Daily Mail link - sorry it was the only one I could find) was under discussion:

Whenever one of these ""mistaken identity"" cases hits the news, the journos always make strenuous efforts to remind the reader that the ""vigilante"" only attacked the victim because they mistakenly believed him to be a paedophile. The implication being that the wrongdoing lies not in the vicious assault, but in the misplaced target for their wrath. If the victim had been a genuine nonce then justice would have been done and everyone could pat themselves on the back.

The fact of the matter is that the legal status of the victim is immaterial. Regardless of whether he is a paedophile, a murderer, a benefit cheat, an investment banker, innocent of any crime or literally Hitler, we have a justice system in place, one that does not involve violent, dangerous thugs administering beatings. Someone needs to make it clear to Lee James and his ilk that we cannot and will not tolerate violent crime.

Additionally I think it's fairly clear in this case that there was no genuine suspicion; James merely used the accusation to justify his thirst for blood. I would suggest that this is true in the majority of such cases: violent people are compelled to find an outlet for their urges and nobody around them is safe as long as they are allowed to roam free. People convicted of violent crimes should be required to undergo treatment and should be subject to the same supervision orders as sex offenders.",0,1385675112,null,0,false,0,cdp5zd4,t3_1rn4ta,t1_cdp5zd4,t3_1rn4ta,null,1428471239,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

So the debt would never get smaller, no matter how much you paid, meaning all debts would have to be written off after 30 years. Factoring in inflation it meant the government lost money.

true,roxieh,null,null,"I work in pensions, so for what it's worth:

- You get tax relief on your pension contributions. This is a good thing
- Most private employers offer ""defined contribution"" pension schemes. You and your employer contribute to a pot of money that is invested where you choose. The aim is to gain investment growth with which to buy a pension when you retire. They're not ~amazing~ but will hopefully get better in time.
- Public sector jobs and some private companies will offer ""defined benefit"" pension schemes. These are vastly superior and if you can get yourself into one, it's a good thing. You still pay money from your salary, but this goes into a collective pool of money that the company uses to pay people's pensions directly, rather than from a third party insurance company. Annual pension is worked out by your salary and your years of service with the company.
- BE SURE you can afford to pay into your pension; once the money is in there, it cannot be easily retrieved (usually only if you're dying; seriously). You can't just leave and have your money back. 
- Another thing: if you pay into a pension scheme at your company but leave after a year of working there, you will almost certainly have to move the money to another pension scheme somewhere else. Be prepared for this. This can be another occupational scheme, a personal pension scheme, whatever, as long as it's registered.
- Retirement is a big deal and you're good to think about it early. Occupational pension schemes are better than personal pensions purely because of the support of your employer and the lack of fees you're likely to face.

As for how much and how to save, the MSE guide will kit you right out.

Scotland doesn't exist as an independent nation, thereofore it has no international waters.

If Scotland were *allowed* to form a separate nation by the UK, it would have to be under agreed terms. If Scotland wanted to form it's own separate nation *without* the UK's consent, it would need to be internationally recognised as a separate state as per international law.

Part of being recognised as an independent state is countries recognising your borders. The UK will say it doesn't recognise Scotland's claim on the north sea oil area *which is part of the UK right now* and therefore wont allow Scotland to access it, claiming it is UK water.

It wouldn't be sending gunboats into Scotland's waters at all, it would be sending gunboats to *the UK's waters* and then saying it doesn't recognise Scotland's claim to the waters. Which is exactly what happens in Gibralter (Spain claims it, we disagree) the Falklands (Argentina claims it, we disagree) and the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands (China claims they belong to it, so does Japan but Japan currently controls them).

In a situation of a dispute, whoever actually physically has control of it isn't going to be invading it is it? Has Japan ""invaded"" the islands? Has Britain ""invaded"" Gibralter or the Falklands?

No, of course not. It had control of the territory, then a dispute arose and no-one has done anything about it. Shit like this is going on world wide every day. Did you know the UK and Icelandic government constantly argue over a chunk of rock in the north sea as it can be used for claimnig international water? Probably not as the public don't give a fuck and the public in other people's countries doubly don't give a fuck.

If the UK were to refuse Scotland access to the oil fields, it would probably piss off some people in the international community but no-one would be shouting ""INVASION"", they would be saying the UK should drop it's claims to the area and recognise it as Scotland's, which the UK would disagree with.

You're right it's not likely to happen, but it can happen within the confines of international law which means that the UK has an alternative to negotiations, Scotland doesn't. 

Seriously answer me this: The referendum passes and it's a Yes vote. The UK refuses in the negotiations to let Scotland have the oil field and that's a condition of Scotland ceding from the UK. What does Alex Salmond do?

true,GoldenSama,null,null,"Well, from an in-universe perspective, there's a lot we don't know yet. Apparently the War Doctor and the Meta-Crisis Doctor both count towards the regeneration limit, which would make Matt Smith's Doctor on his final regeneration. 

However, whether Smith's Doctor is on his final regeneration or Capaldi will be the final regeneration... both facts are entirely irrelevant. Something will happen to give the Doctor new regenerations. It's possible it will involve the Sisterhood of Karn. It's possible that when he finds Gallifrey and saves it, the Time Lords will grant him a new set of regenerations, as they once did for the Master.

Regardless of HOW the Doctor passes the limit, one thing is for certain... he will. Doctor Who is more popular than ever, so the BBC certainly won't be ending it anytime soon.

As to HOW The Doctor will cheat death -- as I stated above, there are two obvious options on the table... which is why I suspect neither of those options will be the answer. Moffatt isn't one to do the obvious thing.

My guess is the Christmas Special will answer this very question.

You like saying that, don't you?

I thought you where referring to after Scotland would have gone independent.

If the UK seized the oil reserves (which they have previously agreed Scotland is entitled to) in the two year period in between the vote and actually going independent, I'm still confident that the international community would recognise this as grossly immoral, exploitative and megalomaniacal if not necessarily illegal (which it still may be) and act against that.

You just can't do things like that anymore– this is not the age of empire. 

I'm not sure seizing the oil would be worth permanently souring a valuable trading relationship, plus the massive impact on Britain's image worldwide; which could easily lead to sanctions. Could you imagine how undignified it would be for Britain where to do something like that? If we balk at Israel pulling this sort blatantly devious, how would people react to the cornerstone of the modern western world doing this? Furthermore, any government who would do this would only galvanise support against Westminster between indifferent or even anti-independence Scots, not to mention a fair few of the rUK citizens.

Again, it may not be illegal, but doesn't mean people will stand for it. There's a difference between Yugoslavia and Britain.

I see Gerrard Hendo Lucas as a midfield triangle that could operate in a few different ways.

Also, Gerrard could slot back and hold with Lucas leaving Hendo and Coutinho as CAMs to move the ball through to SAS. Ultimately, we could also see both Gerrard and Hendo push up with Lucas cleaning up in front of our back 4.

If they said ""Yes scotland has the oil"" then sent in ships or something that would obviously be illegal, but you'd never do that, you'd just refuse to ""hand it over"" in the first place.

Can you tell me where the UK government has agreed Scotland is entitled to all the oil? Because I've never seen anything saying they have agreed to that (though obviously if they have I'll be happy to retract that).

You say you can't ""do stuff like that any more"" but I have literally just given you 3 examples of where that is happening on  daily basis, 2 of which actually involve the UK.

You mention us balking at Israel, what has anyone actually done to stop them from settling the west bank? Nothing, and that is something that really is black and white illegal in international law. 

You're right it would probably result in a lot of countries thinking Britain is being childish, but this is te point: The UK *can* do it, which in turn effects negotiations. Salmond can't just ""walk away"" from the table and reject the UK's offer because if he does he doesn't get independence (unless he's going to start a revolution). He's claiming he will negotiate all these things for Scotland, but has no negotiation strength. It's like watching a small business owner say how he will negotiate a load of concessions off Tesco. It just wont happen.

Also you talk about a valuable trading relationship, but the vast majority of the UK's trade goes to the EU, which we've already said the UK can veto Scotland's membership on. If Scotland is outside the EU it will need to pay hefty tariffs to import/export with the EU, meaning the UK would need border guards at the Scottish border. 

Again, I'll repeat all this is unlikely, but that's because salmond probably knows all this so he's not going to call anyone's bluff. There's a general election in 2015 so there could be a huge tory majority, a fresh labour government etc and possibly 2 years later a referendum on staying in the EU.

true,simonbatterberry,null,null,"Half way through Series 8, I'd have the Doctor near death, but instead of regenerating, he'd summon the Valeyard, who would steal a spacecraft to get to Gallifrey first.  Towards the season finale, the Valeyard will get there and manipulate the High Council, including a stark-raving mad Rassilon, to hunt down the Doctor.  During the ensuing pursuit, Clara will get extremely close to getting killed, forcing the Doctor to drop her off in a remote planet knowing that she's no longer safe with her, but not knowing she's pregnant with his child.  

Next series will deal with the Doctor generally protecting the universe from various threats sent out by the Valeyard and Gallifrey to find him while trying to find a way to get to the Valeyard himself without getting his ass handed to on a valadium plate. (perhaps a search for the key to time?!)  The series will end with the Doctor getting saved from Gallifrey by a MASSIVE fleet (like, the size of a fuckin' galaxy) commandeered by his 20-year old daughter from the future.

Christmas special will show Gallifrey getting raw-dogged by the fleet while the Doctor and his kid fight the Valeyard and Rassilon who, by this time, regenerated into Stephen Fry.  The Valeyard gets himself thrown into the Eye of Harmony, but the Doctor's daughter gets slaughtered by Rassilon, who then activates the Final Sanction.  Imagine everything being pitch black, with nothing more than the Doctor floating around.  That's the next 20 minutes of the special, with him contemplating his existence, wondering if he's failed or if he's even meant to do what he did in the first, even comparing himself to nothing as he realizes that the Sanction was botched and that he's the only thing left in the universe.  The climax will come when he remembers everything good he's done, and then comparing himself to the gods, recreating the universe with his sheer will (suck it, 7) and waking up in the TARDIS to a group of people from Calabi-Yau Space requesting him to join them in paradise.  He kindly rejects their request, remembering that Clara waits for her with a child.

My evidence is this, which is already stated and ignored by you:  Eleven referring to the Moment's activation, ""I don't want to see it again."". As in it's happened once before. It happened. It was an actual thing which took place. During 30-40 year Prime, the War Doctor activated the Moment. And in the duration between then and 50 year Prime, Gallifrey was dead. Meaning that all stories and episodes produced within that time frame reflect that truth. That is one point of several which evidently support such an event taking place. Not to mention it's documentation within the audiobooks, where Moffat retrieved the idea.

However with Deus Bad Wolf Machina intervening in year 50 Prime, Gallifrey also exists out of time and space inside a pocket universe. And has for the last seven series. It is both dead and preserved. A paradox, but sustainable on the tree that is the Prime Time Line.

Not unlike Schroedinger's Cat.

The majority of our squad were from other parts of the UK and Europe (plus the Americas, depending which year you looked at). 

What I'm saying is our squad over the past decade has been made up of non-english players. It would be difficult to field an all English starting eleven, especially now that expectations are higher and the amount of quality English players who can fit our system is sparse. Couple that with the high prices of English players and it would be difficult to see an increase in Englishmen playing in our first team.

&gt; ""There was no reaction, wrong decisions - so I am not so sad with them as I understand, the team was not fresh and maybe I should make more changes in the team.

&gt;""But when you get such a good performance against West Ham you have that temptation of playing the same team as they played so well, it is difficult to change them.

&gt;""I made one change with Eden (Hazard) as I thought he could make a difference coming from the bench but perhaps I should have changed more players.

which, to me, is Jose professing that he is at fault. Therefore, it isn't an excuse, as he isn't trying to shift the blame. It's an explanation of why we were second best in the game.

Hence why none of the RTD plots did it either.

Bad Wolf? Explained in a minute.

Donna's importance? Pretty much a throwaway line.

This is not bad; all of those plots were great and didn't feel rushed or anticlimatic at all.

This is what most people aren't getting: Story arcs are the things that go on for long times. Their explanation shouldn't be complicated and stretched out. And Moffat does that: He leaves hints and plot scattered about until the characters decide ""Okay, we've gotta figure this out."" And they do. And while some of his earlier explanations were sort of... stupid (specially Season 5. If you take the explanations without the writing, it sounds really fucking stupid. It's only good because the episodes have great writing), he's getting better at it (NOTD/DOTD left very little questions unanswered and wrapped up their respective plotlines in a very satisfactory way).

I would say Moffat has been trying too hard. But, as time passes, I feel like he's been getting close to succeding as hard as he's trying, and that's when you know you have a great writer.

Now look at the Chelsea counterparts, i.e. Willian Oscar and Eto'o. See the difference?

In fact, look at the heat maps on espnfc.com or if you have a subscription, check the heat maps on Opta. Sure, Oscar and Willian are prone to swapping places on occasion and so are Oscar and Ramires but you'll still see them overlapping.

Still not convinced? Watch the game again and you'll see that Oscar, Willian and Ramires were almost always within a few yards of each other when we had possession. HOWEVER, the number of passes successfully exchanged between them was abysmally low. In contrast, Streller and Stocker did a far better job of rotating their positions and were ably assisted by Fabian Frei and others with some quick passing on the counter. Each covered for the other when out of position.

Overloading works when two (or more) players can pressure the opposition in tandem - one pressures the player into making a mistake and the other player capitalizes on it, recovers the wayward ball and immediately lays it off to another teammate. Pass and move. No hold-up, no flashy dribbles.

Oscar, Willian, (to some extent) Hazard and even Torres are guilty of almost always attempting to dribble their way through the opposition. If they could successfully manage it all the time, they would draw at least four defenders to themselves, thereby freeing up at least two Chelsea players to make threatening runs into the opposition box. This strategy is also a huge risk because if the opposition manages to close the dribbler down and recover the ball, it leaves the player(s) making the run stranded high up and gives the opposition a golden opportunity to counter quickly. If the players dribbles too far inside from the wings, the central player must make an instantaneous decision to cover the gap or wait for the through ball or risk crowding the box.

So you see, over-confident and (often) unnecessary dribbling is what actually results in overcrowding in the box - something we have been guilty of, time and again this season.",0,1385690468,null,0,false,0,cdpaov6,t3_1rj630,t1_cdpaov6,t1_cdovd5p,null,1428468969,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

Everyone has to be referred by a professional, you can't just walk in the door - it's usually a social worker, support worker or health visitor.

People are so ashamed most of the time having to come and 'beg' to get very basic cheap tinned food so they don't go hungry. It doesn't matter why they are in that situation - we are a civilised society and we have a duty to make sure everyone can put food on the table. Just for a second imagine being in such desperate circumstances that you would cry with relief when someone gave you some value tinned baked beans.

Everyone has to be referred by a professional, you can't just walk in the door - it's usually a social worker, support worker or health visitor. If someone is referred to us more than three times in a year, they are referred on to other services to try and help them better manage their money but that is a tiny tiny number of people. Most who claim have just had unfortunate circumstances; maybe they got sanctioned on their benefits and have nothing to give their children for tea - **30% of the people we feed are CHILDREN.** Maybe they are a single mother who just got her own flat, can't budget or do maths because no one , and runs out of formula milk a week before her next benefits come in. That happened and without us, I dread to think what could have happened to that child.

We do have a welfare state, but you have to wait for claims to be approved, sanctions to be lifted and money to come your way. When people don't have food, they need help TODAY not next week and the government doesn't work that fast. No one in this country should be going hungry when we can more than afford to feed everyone. It's a disgrace.

**Tl;dr we shouldn't talk about 'deserving' and 'undeserving' because this isn't some sort of luxury service, this is the most basic of human necessities for the most vulnerable and desperate in society.
