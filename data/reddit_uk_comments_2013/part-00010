* You're going to clap with glee each time you see Bale on the ball, but die a little inside knowing that one of these years he's off to Madrid.
* Sandro is a beast, him and Dembele are going to be your favorite players in the squad (and Scott Parker) even though they don't do anything lavish and exorbitant, they're the two most vital players in the team.
* Vertonghen is as close to perfection as you can get. You will wake up and pray for his fitness with the rising sun.
* You hate Gallas.
* Defoe is selfish and frustrating, but he gets the goals every now and then so you put up with him.
* We have something called a Lennon. We believe the first sketch of the Concorde was based on him.
* We also have something called a Dawson, which is slow, but it puts in a heck of a tackle and is a solid CB.
* Our keeper Lloris has the ability to fly, but we keep it hush-hush. You will occasionally see him do it when absolutely necessary, but we've mostly got him to look handsome for the cameras as he stands in goal.
* You hate Gallas.
* We have a player named Kyle Walker. While he's superfast, he's also superstupid at times and gets us in trouble. But he more often than not makes up for it and on his day he's close to the best right back in England.
* Counter-attack is us. The only team in the world that's better on the counter than us is Real Madrid, and we're okay with that given that they spent six trillion to get that squad together to counter.
* Our chairman, Daniel Levy, also known as Hard Bargain Saul, can sell sand to an Arab.
* You hate Gallas.
* We are proud of all the good looking men in our team, just can't get over them.

They'll have to make you a fresh burger, and trust me, it's worth it, they're actually yummy as fuck when they're fresh. This method is only guaranteed to work for Beef Burgers, Chicken not so much. 

Snack Wraps are often made to order too, as well as the fish ones. The Salads are actually pretty alright too, and the chicken you get in those, and in the deli sandwiches and stuff isn't fresh, it's precooked when it comes, and then steam heated, but it's pretty alright, so if you want chicken, i'd go for those. Generally just avoid the McChicken, you can't guarantee you'll get a fresh burger, even if you order with cheese or whatever, the chicken may still have been sitting for 20 minutes (It's supposed to be no more than 20 minutes, but I've seen some sit there for over 3 hours).

I worked for McDonalds for a while when I was at uni, and I got to see some of the practices, and so as I say, I generally either order an extra ingredient or removal of one. The good thing is, you can usually see what burgers they have waiting to be used for orders, as the popular ones are usually cooked in batches, and then packed into their boxes and left to wait, all the while cooling down and becoming less yummy, again, these are only supposed to sit there for a short while, but I've seen some stay for 30-40minutes and then be sold to customers.

If you go during a busy time, and you order a popular burger, you're pretty guaranteed to be safe, as they're churning them out pretty often, but if it's quiet, just ask for extra pickle or something, it's the easiest way.

Difficult to believe considering your message seems to be...

&gt; Get over it. [...] *MOVE ON.* 

You don't attempt to inspire discussion, you attempt to assert a message. That message being ""quit complaining about Moffat"". You even continue, presuming even that ""it seems to stem from the simple fact that they aren't RTD and Tennant"". That's *definitely* asserting your own opinion.

I think saying that Moffat's made mistakes or that some episodes have large flaws is just as ""meaningful"" as saying their perfect. It's a matter of opinion and so long as you voice it *civilly* it is one hundred-percent acceptable.

Nobody should feel like they can't speak their mind. This community is for everyone to share their opinions, even if those opinions don't agree with what you think.

Now don't misunderstand me. Posts that merely say ""MOFFAT SUX"" are no good. But people who voice ""Moffat's handling of Angels in Manhattan was positively absurd and a wholly unfitting conclusion to the Pond's as companions"" are. They're adding discussion, and discussion should be ***encouraged***, not discouraged.

/r/Gallifrey actually experienced people who made posts of a similar nature of this one. Instead of jumping on that ""stop hating Moffat"" bandwagon, I actually went out and developed a ""Love Week"" where every day of that week I made a short essay summarizing something great about Doctor Who.

I wrote about [**the theme tune**](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/110rk3/love_week_the_theme_tune/), [**Murray Gold's work**](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/10q79n/love_week_part_one_the_works_of_murray_gold/), [**LGBT protrayal in New Who**](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/10s8uh/love_week_part_two_lgbt_portrayal_enthnic/), [**Millenium FX's practical effects**](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/10ucul/love_week_part_3_millenium_fx/), [**the Doctor's Wardrobe**](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/10wgdn/love_week_part_4_the_wardrobe_of_the_doctor/), and [**historical episodes**](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/10yqz0/love_week_part_5_whats_your_favorite_historical/).

This inspired others to write about [**their favorite Series Seven episode**](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/10w57y/love_week_favorite_season_7_episode/), [**the work of the CGI company The Mill**](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/10up34/love_weekpart_35_the_mill/), [**what moment made them love Doctor Who**](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/10uh0j/what_moment_sparked_your_love_for_doctor_who/), and the show's [**portrayal of religion**](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/10stth/religion_and_doctor_who/).

Think of it as an unsecured interest-free loan that you can call in at any time by visiting a store with the voucher. That's basically what it is in HMV's accounts. The only real difference is HMV pay you back in products to the value of the voucher rather than cash.

Of course, the problem with an unsecured loan is if the business you're lending money declares themselves insolvent and goes into administration, you can't simply walk in and demand your money back. 

There's a legal framework that explains what has to be done to ensure that nobody gets preferential treatment except where the law says they do. And in order to ensure that law is followed, the business isn't really involved in following it. That's handled by the administrators.

&gt; They had (and I assume paid for the right to) access to fibre over BT Openreach's network (aka BT Infinity) before anyone else. It has only recently become available to other providers.

where ""they"" I assume means BT Retail. There's nothing to prove that, and third party ISPs have been involved in the trials from day one (and therefore would be in a position to launch when BT were ready to).

Indeed, AAISP claim to have provided one of the first FTTC connections via BT's network - http://aaisp.net.uk/news-fttc-budgens.html - so not ""only recently become available to other providers"" at all.

Your link to OFCOM doesn't really say anything, since over a year before BT was already getting third party ISPs involved in trials.

As for what Sky is doing that is irrelevant too. They're one ISP and for some reason it took them a long time to roll out a product - that's nothing to with BT having fibre exclusivity, that's Sky being slow, and there are probably something like 20 ISPs offering fibre services even before Sky did so.

Only Barca, Real Madrid, PSG and maybe Bayern could afford him and I would assume Suarez would prefer to play in Spain over Germany and France
Another thing we have to take into account is that Suarez is not the typical modern footballer. He had a poverty stricken childhood, earned a paltry sum and Ajax for the calibre of player he is and the fact that he was their captain, and was initially only earning about 50000£ a weak when he first arrived here.

Operated by Castle Air

Helicopter was diverting to Battersea heliport before crash due to weather

**

The Helicopter was a twin engined  Agusta 109 with one person aboard;

Weather - EGLC 34003KT 0700 R09/0800 R27/0750 FZFG BKN001 M03/M03 Q10

which means the visibility was 700m, there was freezing fog with clouds at 100 feet, temp of -3

The Crane the chopper struck was marked on aviation charts - 

HIGH RISE JIB CRANE (LIT AT NIGHT) OPR WI 1NM 5129N 00007W, HGT 770FT AMSL (VAUXHALL, CENTRAL LONDON), OPS CTC 020 7820 3151 12-10-0429/AS 2.

There are special routes helicopters fly through London. Air Traffic Control like you to be above 800ft directly following the Thames, the max height of the crane was 770ft

http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/7/20100316LondonHeliChart.pdf

http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/7/EIS%2006.pdf

Aircraft altimeters work on the principle of air pressure. One cause for altitude problems for the helicopter would be the weather changing and the pilot not updating his altimeter to the new pressure. His Altimeter would then give a false altitude value and he could have been lower than he thought. The -3 degrees temperature would have incured a 10% error in altitude readings as well.

Some will be their for their own gain, some will want to use the system to benefit companies, some may be too dumb and be easily persuaded by others etc... We all have flaws so no system is perfect. Sadly such a system as you have will never happen. The rich few that hold the public to ransom, stand to lose far too much. So the only way this will happen is with some uprising. Sadly we are all too British for that. Protests and demonstrations recently have been a shambles in which the government just brush aside and ignore.

We do need a system in which the public are not frightened of those in power. Those in power are frightened of the public.",0,1358331895,null,0,1358350010,0,c7xue69,t3_16ne7r,t1_c7xue69,t3_16ne7r,null,1430979367,3,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,3

true,The3rdWorld,eng-essex,Essex,"my grandma was a photographer and for as long as i can remember when she wanted camera equipment she'd get on a train and ride to London so she could visit the camera shops around Tottenham court road, etc -she did this because the only camera shop we had was Jessops and even if they had what she wanted it was much cheaper going all the way some were else.  
  
Jessops failed because their business model was 'capture a local market and charge then through the wazooo because they've got no other options.  
  
Sure the London stores had an advantage in volume, although only on a per-store basis - had Jessops used their collective purchasing power they'd have blown them out the water, just as tesco do to all the small shops.  Rent's are higher in london, staff get paid more, and that's before you factor in the time and money spent getting there - but still it was always worth it.  
  
Just like curries, dixons, pc world, even to a degree woolworths the business model was to offer people a limited selection of over priced goods because most people either didn't have the specialist knowledge or access to alternatives.  
  
Then along comes the internet, suddenly the only thing these stores were good for was to actually touch the things you'd later buy on line (at a fraction of the cost) but then people even stopped doing that; they began to rely on review sites and websites learnt to put plenty of details and pictures... even worse for them people were so used to buying expensive things online they thought nothing on nipping on amazon or ebay to find a quick pack of batteries or tapes...  people realized it was even easier to simply order something and wait for it to turn up than to go into these garish buildings in the fast becoming run down high street.  
  
The out of town shopping centres once a sunday mecca are fast becoming desolate waste grounds - there's already talk of the one nearest me becoming a housing estate.

I'm pretty sure you have to be the child of a naturalised or native British citizen. Your mother simply has a British passport, which entitles her to British citizenship but I don't think she can pass it on with just that. I could be wrong.

I am an Australian with a British wife. My two children hold dual Australian/UK passports. I am currently living in the UK, and I will apply for my UK passport and citizenship in just over 2 years.

I don't automatically get a UK passport so I am here on a spousal visa (cost me £800) and I have to live here for 3 years before I can apply for a UK passport. I get finger-printed and questioned every time I enter the country.

People with NO UK connections need to live in the country for 5 years before they can apply for UK citizenship. You can't live here for longer than 6 months unless you have *a* visa of some sort. This is why student visa are the usual point of entry for foreign students, as the student visa can potentially allow you to stay in the country for long enough to become a citizen.

I think your situation would be similar to mine. You should be able to get a Visa that allows you to live and work here, but your citizenship might take longer.

true,ArtistEngineer,australia,Cambridgeshire,"A [British Passport](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_passport) is what you are aiming for.

&gt; British passports may be issued to people holding any of the various forms of British nationality, and are used as evidence of the bearer's nationality and immigration status within the United Kingdom or the issuing state/territory.

A passport will allow you to freely enter the UK, live and remain in the UK, and work in the UK. This is 99% of the what you're after.

So this might help you: https://www.gov.uk/british-passport-eligibility

&gt; If you were born on or after 1 January 1983, you will be a British citizen if your mother or father was either:

&gt; a British citizen when you were born

&gt; ‘settled’ in the UK when you were born

&gt; In most cases you will be a British citizen if your mother or father was born or naturalised in the UK.

I think the confusion occurs in the definition of ""citizenship"" and ""nationality"".

&gt; Citizenship is a legal status in a political institution such as a city or a state. The relationship between a citizen and the institution that confers this status is formal, and in contemporary liberal-democratic models includes both a set of rights that the citizen possesses by virtue of this relationship, and a set of obligations or duties that they owe to that institution and their fellow citizens in return.

&gt; Nationality, on the other hand, denotes informal membership in or identification with a particular nation (which is not a synonym for country or state).[1] While nationality is sometimes conferred as a legal status (see below), it and nations are properly understood as social categories, characterised by at least a common language, culture and territory, and sometimes also by a common religious faith and a purportedly shared ancestry.""

true,DukePPUk,null,null,"At the moment, legal action for simply sharing music files is very rare. There haven't been any civil cases for about 6 years (mainly due to them being too expensive) and criminal cases have been limited to [2011 conviction](http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-05/31/scotland-gets-first-file-sharing-conviction) in Scotland and (mentioned in that article) some convictions in 2010 (dating back to activities in 2006). To be blunt, these convictions are highly dubious - all rely on guilty pleas and in the 2010 cases, there was a co-defendant who pleaded not guilty and who was never prosecuted. The prosecution also used the wrong law.

In theory, uploading on a scale ""prejudicial to the copyright owner"" is a criminal offence. In practice, the police don't seem to care that much, so it is only private enforcement groups like FACT Ltd using these laws, and they tend to be focusing on people running file-sharing sites, rather than individual file-sharers.

As mentioned below, there is a ""three-strikes"" programme in the pipeline; introduced in 2010 but still not working. It is expected to be operational by March 2014 (but the last I heard on that was back in July, and a few things were supposed to have happened by now which haven't).

The way this plan works is that after 3 accusations (which someone can't really defend, but gets warned about) a internet subscriber goes on an anonymous list of ""allegedly-repeat-infringing-subscribers"" which can then be given to the relevant copyright owners (or more likely, private enforcement groups). That list can then be the basis of a lawsuit, or simply handed to the police to ask them to investigate.

If that plan doesn't work (or does work, but not enough, or works perfectly, showing that more is needed - whichever one the lobby groups argue), there is a second ""tier"" to the plan (which cannot be introduced until a year after the first part is running) whereby any sort of legal action is skipped and the ISPs have to impose ""technical measures"" on an allegedly-repeat-infringing-subscriber's connection, which could include disconnecting them from the Internet (but probably won't go that far as the Courts really don't like that sort of thing).

There is a 3-strikes policy planned for March 2014, but I'm not sure it will be ready by then (some things that were supposed to have happened over the last 6 months to keep to that schedule haven't - the Government doesn't seem to be that interested) but the first stage only involves notifications and lists. The technical measures cannot be brought in until at least a year after that (so 2015 at the earliest) and that's if everything goes just right for that.

There is no such thing as a ""civil prosecution"" in the UK, and the 1988 law doesn't talk about copyright theft (because it isn't theft in the UK). If a person is sued, damages for infringement should be roughly equal to the actual loss caused. There is no real case law on this (although some comments in the various copyright trolling cases) but that would likely be [number of files uploaded] x [lowest price for each file] x [factor meaning one upload isn't equal to one lost sale]. A recent German court (similar rules) put damages at &lt; €100. The main cost will be the legal fees (possibly £10,000s).

Fines are unlikely for personal file-sharing (although possible). There have been some convictions but they were all on the basis of guilty pleas (including some where the prosecution used the wrong law).

The American model of going after Internet users (mainly for cash, rather than for any sort of justice) was pioneered in the UK by the music industry. However, it was expensive, unreliable and unpopular so they gave up.

Take into account that the claim is normally processed *within* that time, so you could receive payment before then if the claim is straightforward, (as in no extra information for the Benefit Centre to look at, for example second properties or capital).

A signing on, also known as FJR, *has* to take place before any payments can be issued. Your will be advised of your first signing day by your advisor.

Up until then, the only other thing I can advise you do is apply for a Crisis Loan by ringing 0800 032 7952. It is an interest free loan which should cover you up until you receive your first payment of JSA. 

Lastly, Crisis Loans will sometimes refuse to pay out to you after your first signing on has taken place because they expect people to have been paid by this point. If at any point you get refused a Crisis Loan, you can ring the JSA enquiry line from inside your Jobcentre Office and request an emergency payment. It is very unlikely that an emergency payment will be granted during the early stages of the claim.

When Nine talks to it, it doesn't know about the Time War, so it probably just wasn't there when the rest of the Daleks were timelocked. Then in the first season's finale, the Dalek Emporor explains how those Daleks were there. ""You destroyed us, Doctor. The Dalek race died in your inferno, but my ship survived, falling through time, crippled but alive. ... We waited here in the dark space, damaged but rebuilding.""

The Daleks from ""Army of Ghosts"" and ""Doomsday"" (sob), also known as the Cult of Skaro, were hiding in the Void, which is the cracks between dimensions. The Doctor opened the Void to pull everything with void stuff back in, but the Cult of Skaro used emergency temporal shifts to escape.

The emergency temporal shifts bring them to 1930 Manhattan for the episodes ""Daleks in Manhattan"" and ""Evolution of the Daleks."" At the end of these episodes, all the Daleks in the Cult of Skaro are dead except for Dalek Caan, who uses another emergency temporal shift to escape.

We find out where he went in the season four finale. The emergency temporal shift brought him back inside the Time War (which was supposed to be impossible), where he saved the creator of the Daleks, Davros. Davros then created a whole new race of Daleks using his own cells. At the end of these episodes, Tentoo destroys all the Daleks.

In ""Victory of the Daleks"", the Dalek that Eleven is speaking to says that when they last met (in the season four finale), one ship survived and fell through space. I think that excuse is kind of a stretch at this point, but o k a y. The Daleks get away at the end of this episode because when they gave the Doctor a choice between destroying them or saving the Earth, he chose the Earth. There are more Daleks in ""The Pandorica Opens,"" which I guess are the result of them getting away in ""Victory of the Daleks.""

I... I guess there aren't any Daleks in season six? I never noticed that before. It's a bit unnerving. Hm. Anyway. All that's left now is Asylum of the Daleks. I don't think there's an actual explanation as to where these come in, and I don't feel like combing the script, but if anyone knows, then they should speak up. :)

Whilst I'm not denying that Lloyds had some problems, the extent of it wouldn't have been as bad if they didn't takeover HBOS. That takeover was something that Gordon Brown pushed for, which didn't help the bank themselves and sort of screwed Lloyds over (as well as later, a European Competition ruling saying that Lloyds have to sell 700 branches, which Gordon Brown ignored the competition rules when forcing the takeover).

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"Like any serious team (contending for multiple trophies) RM have a squad rather than a starting 11.

He isn't part of the first 11 but is getting a good amount of time. He played 70 or so minutes last night and looked good. Should have had a goal which he himself set up through some nice defensive work but Luka being Luka he messed up the finish 1 on 1 with the keeper inside the box.

His biggest problem is that he isn't being utilized at RM like he was here, 'Arry let him sit deeper and Luka's strength was the speed he could churn out long/accurate balls. In a second he could have unleashed Bale or Lennon yet in the same position he was also only just beyond the back 4 to help work the ball out from the back. he was also the only creative player for 2/3's of the pitch and so nobody really stood on his toes (this allowed him to get the ball in the positions he wants it which opened him up to the types of plays he wanted to make).

At RM you see him pass the ball and start heading to where he would typically receive it only to run into another RM player occupying the same space, rendering his run useless. The type of movement that made him valuable at spurs is a lot harder for him to reproduce when there are 1 or 2 guys on his toes. I think he is also missing having an out-and-out DM sitting with him, Parker would cover a lot of ground defensively which would help Luka roam. At RM Luka seems to get caught in a defensive position and can't transition to a more attacking location on the field fast enough to be involved in the play.

The final thing which is frustrating watching him play is that the RM players don't have the same faith/trust in him that spurs did. Luka will be standing in a good position and people just won't pass him the ball. After watching him at spurs I know what he is capable of when receiving the ball on the edge of the 18 yard box with space but it seems his current team mates don't know about his capabilities and so opt to pass it behind him or over him to someone else.",0,1358341729,null,0,false,0,c7xvk0y,t3_16okgk,t1_c7xvk0y,t1_c7xvgjf,null,1430979901,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

I haven't bought a new title on DVD for a while - I think the last one was the second season of *Luther* only 'cause I couldn't get it on Blu-Ray.

For DVD quality films, online streaming / digital downloads are more than sufficient. But due to the compression and lack of sufficient internet connections, most movie buffs will still buy Blu-Rays.

The problem, is that those like me - who do buy blu-rays, aren't buying them from physical retailers, unless you're the kind of person who collects them, in which case you might buy from HMV for a limited edition steel tin [not my cup of tea.].

All that said? The floor has definitely fallen out of the market when it comes to physical sales. I regularly pop into CEX - the price of blu-rays is ridiculously cheap.

There were several positives to take from this game. Warnock actually played a decent defence - Lees and Peltier are better equipped to deal with teams like Birmingham, who have players with pace and fancy footwork - and told the team to pass the ball. During the previous two games we played against Birmingham, I remember thinking that their defence is perfect for defending against balls in the air for a target man, but weak against balls on the deck. Finally we played to their weaknesses and not their strengths! Also, Austin seemed to have a much better game: he seemed willing to run with the ball again, for the first time since his injury.

However, we shouldn't get carried away. Birmingham could still have scored a hatful against us if they had an in-form striker; the only saving grace is that we made three changes to the defence so I'd like to think that they could get stronger as a unit if Warnock kept it the same (I certainly would - it would be good for Aidy's confidence if he could get a run of games at left back).

Best of all, this could tip the scales in our favour, in terms of being able to afford a player's wages. Hopefully we'll see that paying off in the coming days!",0,1358349100,null,0,false,0,c7xx2eb,t3_16n55c,t1_c7xx2eb,t3_16n55c,null,1430980488,7,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,7

In these debates I'm always brought to think of how we put values on some of these abstract things.

When you ask ""would you be willing to pay three times the current ticket price to pay for safety improvements to the train system"", they say ""no"".

By statement, people will tell you that every life is priceless.

By revealed preference, it seems that people behave as if they value themselves (from memory) at about £1 million.  Which by coincidence is about the average earnings over a working life.  Isn't economics funny?

I'm not sure anyone has yet come up with a good way of putting a value on liberty, or security.

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"HMV essentially ceased existing yesterday when administrators were appointed. As of that moment it's essentially run by Deloitte. Most times all forms of credit are immediately stopped, whilst they ascertain the value of the business - and the value of the assets.

Gift Vouchers / Gift Cards are unsecured debt. They have no legal obligation [so far as I know] to honour them - look on the back, most say they have a cash value of 0.000001p.

As you said - they already have the money. If they've got a DVD for £20, does it make sense from an asset recovery POV to sell it to a consumer for a Gift Voucher - which can't be used to paying business costs, or to sell it to a consumer for £20 cash?

*Deloitte do have a history of restoring gift vouchers / cards after a few days, particularly in companies they feel have a viable chance of being sold. I'd imagine they'll restore Gift Cards / Vouchers - possibly by the weekend, if not early next week.*

**Edit:** Just to add to this, I've just read a comment from a spokesperson for Deloitte who has stated HMV *won't* be accepting Gift Vouchers / Cards whilst they're in administration. Read into that what you will.

Books are both storage and play back and in that sense and while I think we will move to mostly ebooks before too long there will still be uses for physical books more so than cds or dvds. There is also the idea of having a nice collection of books holds more value than even having a nice collection of vinyl (vinyl is analog storage with relatively simple play back and that people still produce and collect is likely a good indication of how books will go)  because there is no need for other play back devices and the ""play back"" is of exactly the same quality. 

People do like to have physical crap so special editions of stuff and hard covered books and so on will no doubt stick around... they will just be a luxury product that will come with the digital download you actually use.

Physical retailers of this stuff are going to have problems, and if you content is just a physical medium for digital content you are screwed, but internet retailers will still be selling physical stuff down the road I thinks.

Booting Moffat doesn't mean people can't discuss how the show can be improved; as fans, we can't improve the show just by *discussing* it. That's up to the showrunner, we're just fans. If Moffat fixed his problems, then fine, but doesn't that unnecessarily hand-holding to you? Like, ""It's okay, you'll do better next time""? 

I think that's something people definitely recognize, and that's not *purely* the reason they want Moffat booted. He makes very, very direct contradictions in a way that is very disrespectful to RTD before him, and he defends his continuity errors by saying the fans aren't smart enough to understand. There are reasons more specific to Moffat as well: he writes women badly, his writing (in Sherlock more than DW that I can tell) can be homophobic, his plots sound very self-congratulatory, I personally dislike how he feels the Doctor is a god trying to be a human.

http://www.fins.com/Finance/Articles/SB130332699181008501/How-to-Get-Ahead-at-Goldman-Sachs

If you can't be arsed, I'll summarise the relevant parts - 

1. Goldman Sachs and indeed other investment banks demand a huge amount from you, more than most people can take long term. Not only do you have to be on top of your game but you have to be so working 110 hours a week handling investments worth millions and millions. You may be earning huge sums of money, but they are getting that huge amount of money's worth from you. 

2. One mistake and you're fired. The turnover rate is very high because there are so many business school graduates from all over the world competing for jobs. They can afford to pay very high to attract the best talent from this pool but if you aren't up to scratch, there will be someone else to take your place. This not only applies to the office but socially as well, anything which could tarnish their reputation. 

3. Bonuses are part of the financial culture and much of the what constitutes actual pay in investment banking is based around the bonus. If you have lasted the year, haven't got fired, got all the hours in, haven't broken down physically and mentally and were a success, you get a bonus. This is seen as part of the salary, think of it like restaurant tips rather than a reward. 

4. If you think it is unfair that they earn so much money, well that's up to you but the actual situation is very different to the greedy lazy image that is painted. Working at Goldman Sachs sounds like a hell that no one would work at if they didn't pay that much.

The offence as defined in the 1956 Act is more specific and homophobic, but was repealed in 1967.

true,dhvl2712,null,null,"I hope it doesn't get answered. Here's my problem with what the question was.

Doctor who is a show about a mad man in a box traveling through space and time saving the universe. So there's definitely going to be some inconsistencies, plot holes and overall unanswered / unanswerable questions that we would have to accept as part of our suspension of disbelief. Things like how exactly the TARDIS works, what happened during the Time War, how Daleks and Cybermen and all them just keep coming back, and other such timey-wimey  things.

For me at least, ""Doctor Who?"" was part of those things. Those things that you don't need to know, and wouldn't really affect the story if you did. ""Doctor Who"" became a running joke, and wasn't a question that needed answering

Now, the phrase ""Silence will Fall"" was everywhere, since the Eleventh Doctor began. It was first said by Prisoner Zero, an enemy of the Doctor. It was then revealed that the phrase is part of a movement dedicated to *kill* the Doctor. It was supposed to be something epic, something devastating, something tragic when silence fell. If silence fell, then the Doctor would be dead or something and the Bad Guys would win.

So to find out that it's ""Doctor Who?"" is incredibly disappointing. It doesn't matter what his name is. He's ""THE DOCTOR"". That's been good enough for 50 years and there's no need to make it important now. Of course ""Silence will Fall when the question is asked"", because no one knows the answer to that anyway, and nobody's really bothered to find out except a few people.

Bear in mind this happened at a time in history when the inhabitants of Ireland were much more likely to be raiding and pillaging Great Britain than the other way round.

ie. The french named the atlantic archipeligo consisting of Ireland, the Isle of Man, GB, the shetlands and the other small islands, the British isles after one of the region's of France they are close to.

In modern, politically correct use we have the Island of Ireland, Island of Great Britain, Isle of Man which all make up the Atlantic archipeligo.

So a lot of folks really do believe that the Constitution is sacred, and any attempt to change one of the key Amendments is seen as an affront to the entire country. We don't have that over here.

Also, considering the USA was very much on the frontier for most of its history, and *was* a dangerous place to live (wild animals, native American attacks, etc etc); having guns was seen as something sensible as a way to defend yourself (see also the Castle Law they have). Britain has been very much tamed for hundreds of years, so we haven't had much of a need for self defence. Whereas, the Home Is Your Castle and the Right To Defend It is a very American idea, stemming from their colonial past.

Bell and Hare is on the corner of the West Stand and Park lane so the closest to the ground. Quieter then the Bricklayers but always packed inside. Can buy cans outside in the garden but it may be a bit too cold.

The Bill Nicholson is on Northumberland Road just past the ground. Is a bit out of the way but has a cult following because it ""has the best looking barmaids in Tottenham"" including some podium dancers... I've only ever been in there to look at the souvenirs on the walls though honest...

The Irish Centre by White Hart Lane train station is the only nearby place that allows Away fans in. You can get Beer in Glass glasses which is a novelty and it's usually quite quick to get served.

The Pride of Tottenham is halfway between Bruce Grove and White Hart Lane so is handy if you are walking from Seven Sisters tube, I've heard it's run by a supporters club type thing but I've never been in there myself. Looks alright though

The Olive Branch is on the road from Northumberland Park station to Park Lane so if you're coming in from there may be the best bet. It looks horrid and I've always kept on walking to the Bell and Hare.

Rudolphs is a nightclub next to Bill Nicholson way (West Stand) It has sticky floors, stinks of piss, serves warm pints and they used to make you buy a membership to get it (Couple of quid) As you may be able to read I'm not a fan

There are loads of other pubs on the walk from Seven Sisters that I've not been in like the Elbow Room and the Beehive and some past the ground towards Edmonton like the Coach and Horses and the Wetherspoons Gilpin Bell which would be the cheapest place to drink in the area.

If you're looking for the atmosphere the Bricklayers is the one to go to, will always be a sing song and there is loads of Tottenham memorabilia on the walls and ceilings. Just don't expect a seat and a quiet chat.

It was possible for a team like Derby County to go from the bottom of the second division one year to champions of the first division in just two years. 

This all changed when the Premier League was formed in 1992, with the intention of taking advantage of lucrative TV contracts for top-division teams, and now an even bigger gulf has formed between teams that qualify for the Champions League and the rest of the Premiership.

Sheer managerial brilliance can't turn a team into champions anymore, because they have to compete with both an endless stream of money from wealthy owners as well as massive TV deals for a few teams that qualify for the Champions league.

AC Milan - Shadow of its former self currently 7th after selling arguably it's two best players.

Inter - Not confident enough? Maybe doesn't want to go to a team Mou has managed? As he has already set the benchmark?

Man City - Have only come into the equation recently, lot of egos no much history, no tradition. I wouldn't have seen him there in the first place. Much better suited to Man U imo. Unfortunately Fergie is a beast and always seems to be doing one more season.

Dortmund - an academy similar to La Masia. Probably the most like Barca in Germany. Unfortunately the position is not available.

Schalke, PSG, Porto, Arsenal, Spurs - are all steps down from Barca. PSG is similar to Man City in its recent acquired capabilities. Maybe Arsenal is different from these but they have lost so many good players that it's just hard to even keep a first XI over a few seasons.

In his first year in charge he won the treble after offloading Ronaldinho, Deco and Gianluca Zambrotta among many others. He then guided Barca to a domestic and continental treble, the first Spanish side to achieve the feat (beating Real 6-2 may I add).

Fabregas had arguably the worst game of his life at the Bridge leg. Messi missed a penalty at the Nou Camp how often does that happen. They had an unbelievable amount of chances, not his fault no one put them away. And you guys need to understand that just because he loses a few times doesn't mean he hasn't got a Plan B. I'm sure you'd say Man U has several plans, yet shock result they lose every so often.

http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/16gy5r/wtf_is_the_guardian_doing_the_observer_publishes/c7w8ah5

There's others in MR, and almost certainly it's popped up in LGBT and Feminism subreddits too. 

&gt;Maybe the publicity might have increased awareness of the issues but judging by the horrible press that the observer have received I'm sure as shit that they didn't plan on that when they published the article.

Maybe, but they have at least one regular transsexual poster (Roz Kaveney) who quickly posted a response which was put straight up on the site. Presumably they knew it was going to be inflammatory although the extent may have been misjudged.

true,nowonmai666,lfc99,null,"&gt;What with the latest news that BOTH Mourinho and Guardiola will be managing clubs in the EPL next season,

The ""latest news"" that I can see is that Guardiola is off to Munich, and Mourinho has been making the same noises as always, telling the English press that he likes English football.

What's changed at Chelsea that would entice Mourinho back? Abramovich still buys overpriced crap strikers and insists on them playing, and Terry still thinks he runs the place. I can't see why Mourinho would go back there: ""never go back"" is a standard maxim in any case, but his reasons for leaving are still in place. The other English clubs he would consider are Man City, Arsenal and Liverpool, and we don't know for sure that any of them will be after a new manager this summer (probably, maybe, and probably not, respectively).

I'd say that the ""latest news"" suggests there's a moderate chance that Mourinho might be managing Man City next season, and Guardiola won't be here at all.

In any case, I don't think Suarez would leave for another English club. Every club's supporters have abused him, spat at him and thrown coins at him, why the hell would he play for them? Why would he stay in a country where the press demonises him at every turn?

If Suarez's ambitions outpace Liverpool's progress, he would look to Spain where at least South Americans are better understood and he couldn't have been stitched up in the way he was in the Evra fiasco.

At 00:35, I believe he's on Park Lane north bound. He could be having a nice cycle in the park instead of shouting ""oi what are you doing? fuck off"" - but yeah, the car driver *was* driving like a twat. There's a number of other points where cars are too close behind, but they're not doing much other than being too close. He can chose the moment and wave them past.

At 1:40 he's got room to move over in the lay-by thing, the bus knew that. After, with the cabby he could have been in the cycle lane again. The lorry left as much room as he could - short of taking a different route the lorry and cyclist were always going to be on the same piece of road. They need to come to some mutual agreement between them. Look behind when you hear the lorry, show him you are doing your best to keep out of his way and he should do the same.

At 2:10. there's 5 lanes - there must be enough space. 

The cabby at 2:18 had stopped to moan at him for something - he wasn't cutting him up. But cabbies *are* dicks. 

2:36 - empty cycle lane again.

2:50 is a legitimate car pulling across his right of way. Bad visibility, so perhaps he should have been cycling slower. Who cares whose right of way it was once your legs are broken?

2:59, he could be over to the left. It makes no difference, the lights ahead are red, he can filter safely to the front on the left and cross to the right on the red light if he likes.

3:06. Not his fault. But still he could have slowed down - a junction is a hazard.

3:15 and 3:25 was pretty shitty driving from the cars.

In my opinion people should do the crime, do the time, and then once they're free they're free to live their lives without harassment.    

Now, yes, right now we have a giant database of so called ""sex offenders"" but even that expires for most of the less serious crimes (peeing in public, public exposure, a 15 and 16 year old sleeping together, etc).    

Now if they took the DNA of people in **prison** I would have no issue with that at all. Just seems a little wrong to go after people who were released and collecting samples from them **at the threat of arrest** if they refuse.   

Also I want to know something:   
&gt; Police hope the collection of thousands of new samples could help to solve so-called cold-cases, where a new sample is linked to a past crime.    

So what happens if the DNA evidence matches? Do we just charge people with the crime based purely on DNA evidence and nothing else? Or do we do DNA and vague circumstantial evidence (e.g. ""this person was living in London and this crime happened in London!!! OMG GUILTY!!!"").    

The DNA database is only as good as samples taken. Some samples (such as those taken from criminals) are of fairly high quality and give us a great deal of entropy but DNA taken from a crime scene: sometimes not so much.

We (me and my gf) live in Ladywood, just across the Hagley Road so not far from Harborne. 

Yardbird is pretty awesome on a Friday &amp; Saturday night, also the Rainbow, Custard Factory etc! You might find something interesting at the Victoria and further afield in Kings Heath at the Hare &amp; Hounds. 

There are some lovely canal walks to do, there's also some nice walking to be done over the Lickey Hills. The Malvern Hills are only 45 minutes away on the train and offer a bit more of a challenge. 

Um, what else? Yes red wine! I really like a glass of red wine! There are a few places that you should check out. Cafe Ikon on Oozells Square does excellent wine by the glass or bottle and it's reasonably priced. All bar one also have a good wine selection but it tends to be very busy. 

Moving into town you should try Loki in the Great Western Arcade. They're a wine merchant but do regular wine tasting sessions and you can also take a bottle from the shop upstairs to enjoy - you have to pay a corkage charge of £5 for the privilege but it's well worth it. 
They're not open late so it's probably more of a Saturday afternoon thing to do. 

Out in the Jewellery Quarter there's the Drop Forge - they do particularly nice wines and it's a great place to relax and read the papers on a Sunday / Bank holiday. 

Closer to home the Junction in Harborne does fairly decent wine.

But I hope there are contingency plans to mitigate the effects that re-establishing the Empire will inevitably have upon the price of tea. 

May I suggest that we delay earthly ambition, and instead concentrate upon capturing Mars and turning it into a massive tea plantation in order that security of supply may be guaranteed? (I would advocate automation of production, in order to prevent any risk that previous misbehaviours be repeated.)

Tea could be sent back to earth using mass-drivers to launch small spacecraft (some propulsion capability would be needed for mid-course correction). Careful Re-entry Vehicle design could then allow us to bombard the natives with highly supersonic tea chests.

A particularly elegant refinement would be to water cool the R.V.. The first troops to capture the newly subdued enemy position would then be rewarded with a fresh brew, which would obviously provide the motivation necessary to tide our forces over once the last scraps of captured Russian guns of Crimean vintage have been minted into the last authentic V.C., and that decoration has gracefully passed into history, after the manner of the late lamented Fawlty Towers...",0,1358368250,null,0,false,0,c7y3h8c,t3_16gu76,t1_c7y3h8c,t1_c7y2srl,null,1430983654,7,false,INGLIN,t5_2v1ve,7

The Yankees are nearly the most successful sports franchise on Earth. Within their sport, they have won nearly 1/4 of all the championships ever played. The majority of their success was achieved before Steinbrenner was even born. Honestly, the Yankees are more popular than baseball itself.

The Dodgers just sold for around $700 million and have a huge payroll...also a better comparison to Chelsea. Plenty of teams in MLB overspend.

Run, just run.
It can’t be dead, for
Death follows nearby.
They always die.
Never forgiven, 
Always loved.
For what?
A pattern.
A repeating, 
never ending,
Necessity of death,
for the universal order.
The necessity of a loved death,
For the unloved,
Unattached, 
Useless,
Lives of the rest.
Why them?
Why always them?
Why not choose them,
Instead of the rest.
Fire.
Fire, what follows the death of a friend.
The unstoppable anger,
The creator of legends,
The end of races,
The end of a friend.
But what can stop this,
This Wolf,
This Bad Wolf.
So, don’t have friends.
Only a word can bring that fire back.
One word, 
A word that the Wolf,
The Bad Wolf calls for.
A call to save existence,
The universe,
Everyone else,
For it never could end,
Only wounded.
Wounded by it’s existence.
Constantly needing,
Needing,
Needing help.
Needing a Doctor.
So it calls.
With a question.
An obvious one.
Not why,
Or how,
but Who?
All to bring that back,
That never ending cycle.
The cycle of Death.
What happens when you friends are like you?
Impossible.
Will the Wolf end it when it demands it?
Will the Wolf realize what it’s done, and correct it?
Will it count, to four,
1 2 3 4,
1 2 3 4,
1 2 3 4,
1 2 3 4,
And continue the cycle,
The cycle that must continue.
Ah, here it is.
The call, 
The call that is one.
One word.
One message from The Bad Wolf.
Pond.
Rose.
Wolf.
Noble.
River.
Doctor.
Clara.

Dear BBC,
From everyone in the Doctor Who community, or even anyone who’s ever watched Doctor Who, I ask, I plead, for Doctor Who to return in February, and not April. We love the story created by the geniuses behind the show, and just want more.

The Soccer (football) episode was also refreshing. Seeing his ""human"" side grounded him to being less than invinceable and kind of a normal person at least for some of the time.

&gt; Do we just charge people with the crime based purely on DNA evidence and nothing else

This is the biggest risk, and there have been some wrongful convictions because people don't understand DNA (or fingerprint) evidence. DNA is unique (other than for identical twins). However they don't record all of the DNA, only a small set of alleles. Ok, so you get a match at the crime scene, and the prosecution can say something like ""Only one person in a million would match this!"". The trouble is that the jury are likely to hear this as ""There's only a one in a million chance that this not the right person!"". In fact with 60M people in the UK, 60 people would match, so if this is the only evidence against the accused, there is a 59/60 chance that he didn't do it. DNA almost always has to be accompanied by other evidence to be used safely.


BTW, the situation with fingerprints is rather worse, in that there is no evidence that they are unique, and also they use only a few points of comparison rather than the whole fingerprint.

A huge portion comes from the fact that the international banking sector which for centuries has been utterly dominated by the West - Britain and America mostly has never really had to deal with competition beyond themselves. Now with an rapidly expanding population and ever increasing GDP's, plus growing economic superpowers in China, India, Australia and Brazil, competition has become ever more fierce. The need for the best talent has [driven up the wage rates of bankers](http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-2181144/Top-bankers-salaries-increase-400-cent-100-years.html). As foreign banks grow ever larger, this effect intensifies.

Banks, at least some banks have taken lessons about using debt and risk, but salary-wise there is little they can do without losing the brains they need to keep going. 

I appreciate that particularly big American investment banks have indeed arguably learned little but you can't judge that on the basis of what their employees are paid, you have to look in to the stability of what they as a company are investing in to gauge that.

I work on the principles of:
1) If I never intended to pay for it. They aren't making a loss. They wouldn't have gotten my money and I would never have seen it.
2) If I enjoy something that I have downloaded I will pay for it. I am effectively judging whether it was worth the money.

For example, I didn't really know mumford and sons, but then having downloaded and listened to one of their albums repeatedly I thought, ""I feel like this is of the quality that they deserve my money"", so I went out and bought the album. 

If, however, I watched a film (like Ghost Rider) where seeing it was so soul crushing, cringeworthy and terrible that to fund such an abomination would only spawn a sequel (as it inevitably did) then they don't deserve the money because they didn't do a good job. When the industry is all about creativity and what they're doing is the equivalent of a lot of this ""modern art"" then they aren't getting a penny.

Given the number of warnings, fines &amp; prosecutions resulting from cyclists giving videos like this to the police (including at least one example from the above compilation, to my knowledge), that should give an indication as to how the law actually demands similar. Remember that many cameras used by cyclists give a wide distortion of the situation and cars are usually closer than they seem, particularly when alongside. Rule of thumb: If you can reach out and touch the car overtaking you, then they're way too close.

With regard to the many variations of ""He didn't have to be in the road/could have been on a cycle path"": Entirely true. And none of the cars in the video *had* to be on that road either. Exactly the same thing can be said of a car using an A-road when a motorway is available running alongside. The road does not belong to any individual group: car, bike, lorry etc. Cyclists are just as entitled as any other type of vehicle. Motorist's sense of entitlement is the one overriding issue facing cyclists, I think.

When it comes to ""He's looking to have a go"": CyclingGaz, and other uploaders like him, have numerous videos that include friendly interactions with drivers, as well as them pointing out when a driver has been good/shown courtesy for cyclists etc.",0,1358376080,null,0,false,0,c7y6dxw,t3_16p0z6,t1_c7y6dxw,t1_c7y2yh8,null,1430985095,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

Nowadays, you've usually only got 40 minutes of story time so the sonic is a handy shortcut.

Regarding history, it wasn't part of the tardis toolkit. It suddenly appeared in a primitive form in one of the second doctor stories,it was generally accepted that the doctor built it himself. A few of the books expanded on this with various prototypes appearing.

In an interview, christopher eccleston was talking about the sonic and pointed out that it used the same colours and textures as the tardis console and that he thought of it as part of the tardis. I don't know if that was intentional at the time, but someone seems to have taken it litterally.

I don't think it's a standard tardis thing, although I wonder why the fifth doctor didn't just build a new one when it got blown up (real reason: JNT hated it) the third doctor easily built a replacment.

So even if Nine -as a general rule- didn't use it for too many non-screwing-in-screws-or-messing-with-locked-doors tasks, the idea that it could be used for more had been around for a while. Two things worth noticing, though- in the same episode, Jack and the Doctor did have some banter about its limited usefulness as a sonic device, AND it was the first episode (IIRC) of Steven Moffat's. Make of that what you will.

Either way, I'm of the mind that it isn't overused. The Sonic has pretty clearly been established as one of the Doctor's most versatile tools (it wouldn't exactly have a point on screen if it really could only screw in screws), and thus far it has been mostly limited to diagnostics and simple (from a story perspective) mechanical tasks. The one major time I can think of it being abused was during Power of Three, but that was because it led to such an unsatisfying conclusion. If the Doctor had redirected the ship, then stayed on board long enough for a more important revelation (the Daleks had requested the invasion in order to take over an Earthside base that housed a potential anti-Dalek weapon, for example), that would have made the ending a thousand times better and made the Sonic's abuse excusable. Still, if that's the only issue I can come up with, that's a pretty good track record overall.

DejahThorisofHelium gives a great example is how the EUs unified trade agreement saves a huge cost in both money and time for businesses trading in the EU. And that's just one of the most visible influences the EU has.

What about deciding if country X provides food that meets the standard designated for consumption in the UK? Regulated by universal EU legislation, if it's made in the EU it's good for the UK. Electrical/Mechanical devices? Regulated by universal EU legislation, if it's made in the EU it's good for the UK.

What about the other way around? A company is doing well in the UK, wants to start selling its products to other places in the EU. Well thats easy, it's regulated by universal EU legislation, if it's made in the UK it's good for anywhere in the EU.

What do you think about the article a few days ago about £4b in funding for the BBC generates £8b in economic stimulus? Well, if the BBC can stimulate the economy by 100% of it's income, how much do you think the EU improves our economy?

Voting ourselves out is the most ridiculous idea ever. And all this talk of referendum is sickening. The fact they want to use a referendum isn't because they think the people will make the right choice, it's because they don't want their party blamed for submitting to the demands of the narrow minded tabloid informed populace instead of doing their job. Their job being making well informed decisions in the interest of the country.

Like it or not, we live in a global economy. Very few developed nations are in any position remotely resembling self-sufficiency. Isolating ourselves from the EU would have serious economic consequences, and also make us irrelevant in shaping the global economy. Do you think superpowers like China and the USA bothered about appeasing the business needs of 60m people? Not likely.

When you buy a gift card, you give a company money, and they promise to pay it back in the form of merchandise when you or someone else shows up with the gift card. If they promised to pay it back in cash, then it would be obvious to everyone that it was a loan. But promising to pay in merchandise doesn't change the fact that it's a loan. If you loaned someone £5 on the proviso that they'd buy you a pint when you next saw each other, you'd still consider it loaning them £5.

The people who bought the cards certainly did have an expectation that their cards would be honoured. I'm certain that HMV's suppliers and bank had an expectation that they would be paid as well. None of these people or companies *deserve* to be in a list of creditors. But that's the unfortunate reality of administration or liquidation. HMV can't pay it's debts, and creditors with security will get paid first, assuming the company is liquidated. This is deeply unfortunate for every unsecured creditor, but it's just a fact.

As far as the Torres-blaming, I'll admit I've turned on Torres pretty hard, as has this sub. But I think we all know that he's not entirely to blame for the run of form this season, and to characterize the subreddit as mindless upvoters for one opinion isn't fair. I've seen several different interpretations of the team and our situation over the past few months, and I've seen many duly discussed and fleshed out. 

This year is the transition year we've been foreseeing for a few years now, and we still need a player or two to make the entire team click. Whether that's a new signing or bring back players from loan in the summer - De Bryune; Lukaku; McEachran; Chalobah; maybe the Fellaini rumors re: connecting defense and attack; someone to finally replace Ballack - remains to entirely be seen, and I would hope is being handled by the back room staff at CFC as is their job, perhaps (and hopefully) even during this window. 

Ultimately, if you want to have a football discussion about CFC, here's the place to do it. Throwing about hate is useless and, I would hope, stems from frustration about our current form rather than actual hatred towards this sub, because as far as I've experienced people are open to different interpretations and are willing to discuss them, rather than simply moan about Torres/Rafa/The Board/etc. ",0,1358383469,null,0,false,0,c7y8w3f,t3_16pja7,t1_c7y8w3f,t1_c7y72gv,null,1430986275,6,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,6

Okay, stop me there. I've been thinking of a theory sorta-like-this for a very long time. The only flaw I could find was the one I described above. As I typed it now, however, I realized why it isn't necessarily a flaw at all. 
When she tells him his name, he trusts her. It's as simples as that he knows he will only give his name to someone he really x10^23 trusts. And that is really times ten with 23 zero's at it's back. That's a lot of really's. 

Still, River doesn't really die. She dies, but her consciousness lives on. It's as if he sends her to heaven. She physically dies, but not really. And as far as I know, she might be downloadable from the place she's in and back to the library. If not that, she should be able to be downloaded and stored on his screwdriver, as that's where she gets uplaoded from in the first place. Maybe the Doctor finds a way to revive her from there, because he's, well, brilliant! I don't know.

Because that would be the worst thing in the world to happen. By allowing players to undermine the credibility of our coaches isn't an appealing thing for future coaches. Pep signed a four year deal with Bayern and from what I've read it's not normal for him to sign such a long deal, normally it's two year deals. So it shows he chose a club for their stability and willingness to develop into something else.

With the volatility by the owner and the fans, why the hell would you want to come to Chelsea?

Interestingly though in the small town I think of as my home town there's a lot more interesting stuff to purchase than on Edinburgh's main shopping streets. My home town was redeveloped and has a lot of small shops that have all sorts of quirky fun things I want to buy. Edinburgh has brand names that can be found in any city selling virtually the same things.

I want to see our current high streets die. The sooner they become derelict the sooner we can redevelop them into something fit for this century.

Several smaller shops are less efficient than one large one and require more staff. More staff is better for the economy!

I want to see new businesses emerge that actually understand that the internet is not going away and so they need to do more than put the goods on shelves. Physical places can do things the internet can't hope to feasibly replicate yet instead of embracing this they fumble around and fuck it up.

So for me HMV was a waste of space. I've no desire for CDs and if I wanted gadgetry I'd buy it online for much less than they were asking.
If instead they'd had a big marketing push, possibly in conjunction with the BPI, promoting vinyl records.

Shipping vinyl is a pain - browsing it in a shop is much more fun. Also, unlike digital music, skipping tracks isn't really that easy. Albums become more of an experience than a series of tracks to be listened to in any order.

Devoting the space they used for gadgets to having some live acts would also have been fun.

The loud voices within the industry actually want the reverse to happen. The theory is that Amazon, by changing the definition of R.R.P in people's heads to now equate ""Really Really Pricey"" have damaged the industry. That the industry itself dissolved the Net Book Agreement, allowing the likes of Tim Waterstone and Jeff Bezos to build these huge companies is seemingly forgotten.

But aye, I've read reports from senior figures who want the Government to set a limit on the reductions the likes of Amazon and supermarkets can discount, so as to attempt to allow physical retailers to compete.

I'm not sure how they think they can get away with it - ""The Agency Model"" which artificially fixed the price of eBooks from five of the big six retailers, for the sole purpose of damaging Amazon, clearly didn't work.",0,1358385134,null,0,false,0,c7y9fhw,t3_16p9k5,t1_c7y9fhw,t1_c7y8oun,null,1430986528,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

This is actually a biazarely common myth. Sexual offences have among the lowest recidivism rates of any crime. In the UK it hovers around 17%, compared to burglary, which is nearly 50%.

Of a list of about 20 crime categories, sex offences generally comes among the bottom five, and sex offences against children are the lowest in the UK.

In the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, violent crime is composed of four offenses: murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault.

[Here is the Home Office document](http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/science-research-statistics/research-statistics/crime-research/hosb0812/hosb0812?view=Binary) Page 16 lists all the crimes included in the ""violence against the person"" figure. Note that in the 36 types of crime in that classification, 18 involve actual harm and 18 don't. The number of offences which involved physical harm were less than those which didn't by 96,000. So out of the 762,515, 338445 resulted in injury or death and 424070 resulted in no injury - most of them not even involving any physical contact at all such as possession of a weapon or ""Public fear, alarm or distress"" which you can be found guilty of just for telling someone in the street to fuck off.

If you actually used the FBI's way of calculating violent crime, the UK figure for violent crimes would drop from 762,515 to 123,664 - over an 80% drop.

Now how different do you think the FBI figures would look if they included all the offences that the UK Home Office lump under ""violent crime""??",0,1358390481,null,0,1358390681,0,c7yb7i8,t3_16ojc9,t1_c7yb7i8,t1_c7xwqhc,null,1430987366,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,ActionPriest,null,null,"I would argue the cause of sex offender registration is substantially media pressure and spikes of public revulsion. These are crimes which create an enormous amount of public panic, and changes to sex offender registration in almost any jurisdiction come in direct response to spikes in public outrage, often in response to concerted orchestrated campaigns from specific media outlets, or events. Laws being named for particular individual victims are not uncommon.

Now, don't take this as a criticism per se of sex offender registration, but in terms of how the laws actually originated I don't think we need to assume the legislation process is rational and evidence based all the time.

For instance I think we can make just as much a case for violent criminal registration. The impact they have on their victims lives is often just as severe, and it can be worse, both physically and psychologically. They are VASTLY more inclined to actually re-offend, particular when the crimes are linked to substance abuse and other pattens of behaviour, and their crimes are far more likely to escalate to more severe crimes, including murder. They are also more likely to commit different types of violent crime, whereas as an SO is less likely change the object of interest, or approach. So a catch all list for violent criminal has more rationale than one which includes both those who extort teenagers online, and those who rape prostitutes.

But this is not even widely suggested, let alone vigorously enforced, and taken as an a priori necesecity of any basic scheme of offender management. There is no such discourse of dehumanizing revulsion for violent offenders, where they can be thought of as subhumans who need tracked constantly, and who deserve ongoing punishment. Well, broadly. Obviously there are papers, and segments of society, in which such a discourse does happen, but nowhere near to the same extent as for sex offenses.

Your last point is fair; I was specifically attempting to address the belief of them being a particular category of criminals which is inclined to re-offend but I concede my wording could suggest a broader interpretation.

Edit:Also fair enough on the use of ""bizarre"". I say bizarre solely because it is so often repeated, when readily available facts completely and consistently refute it. I find that bizarre.

The £200k figure is bogus. Somebody in the media took his Inter *total* wage, with appearances etc. and simply changed the euro sign for a pound sign. This also doesn't take into account the difference between the value of the two currencies, tax regimes and gross v net.

His real old wage was closer to £150k. When he isn't playing, like right now, his wage is much lower than that. Since he knows that he won't be getting that again and Inter offered him less than that, then his destination club would be looking at paying him £100-130k. 

He would also likely be a free transfer, so that kicks up the signon fee a little, but it makes his overall cost lower than Suarez, Carroll, etc. (as [discussed here](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/16gqro/highly_unlikely_but_we_have_aparently_made_a_late/c7w26q4)). He is also looking for an opportunity to reboot his career, before signing what is usually the largest contract a start player signs at the age of 28-29. 

When stories don't die (as Sneijder to Spurs did quickly) and multiply (as this story is) there is something to it. I'd say the chances of LFC signing him have increased from 10% to a little higher than that.

All kidding aside, you gave some easy solutions to difficult problems (eg: the contract situation for lamps/Ashley) If they were to be offered 2 year contracts, it would have happened months ago. We all(or MOST) want them back but reality is we have no say.

Its well known we miss Moses. But surely a squad of our caliber should be able to dispatch Southampton, at home, without him.

While the CC cup would be nice (and I do believe we have a legit shot at finishing in the top 3), that's a horrible return on investment. We go from winning the champs league and the FA cup straight to spending a ton of money in the summer. From there we go on to losing the club world cup, getting eliminated from the champs league group stages, and possibly winning the CC (MAYBE the FA if we can put 2+ goals past Swansea back in Wales which is no easy feat). I understand we may be in a. ""Re-building"" year but still...I think all of our frustrations are warranted.

We lack a philosophy, we lack a real play-style, we lack steel and we lack familiarity.

OK, I had a good laugh at this. 

Lemme give you some context. A lot of this is taken in Fieldgate Street, Whitechappel. If you come out of Aldgate East tube and walk down Whitechappel Road, on the south side you'll come to Fieldgate Street. There is a Tesco Metro on the corner that sells alcohol and if you were to buy a few Cobra or Kingfisher there you may take it down to [Tayyabs](http://www.tayyabs.co.uk/) restaurant, which I strongly advise you do as the food there is amongst the best in the East End. Tayyabs waiters are all Muslim though, so if they see you taking your beer out of the bag they will immediately react, by bringing you a bottle opener and a glass.

There is a strong Muslim presence in the area and though I can't speak for Tower Hamlets, I know that in Barking and Dagenham there is now a borough wide enforcement of engagement with street drinkers. Were it not for the time of night the people with open containers in this video might have found themselves with a friendly warning from the Community Police Officers, as per British law.

Also this kid in this video is about seventeen by the sounds of it and you can clearly see that he's not enforcing anything, he's trying it on, acting in a threatening manner but being told where to get off half the time.

I'm a (young) Boston fan, and I fell in love with the club as soon as I became aware of English football. The honor, value, and camaraderie amongst the entire LFC community is just something incredible. 

Anyway, after catching every game I could, mostly through shitty streams on the 'net, I finally got a chance to see them play live at Fenway this past summer. Not only that, but I was lucky enough to go to a training session at Harvard and *meet the freaking team.* When my uncle (who works for Dunkin' Donuts in sports advertising, and often crosses paths with FSG, and thus got me this opportunity) dropped this on me, I literally couldn't breathe. Later that day, I was have a conversation with **Steven FUCKING Gerrard**, among other greats. 

Long story short, that crazy day of amazingness that I still can't believe happened made me sure beyond any doubt that this is the best club in the world. The chemistry between everyone involved was awesome, all the players and staff were friendly and seemed generally happy to bring me into the community, even though I was just some kid.

The defense is not keeping that much clean sheet but they are making up for it by scoring. 

&gt;that is not the goal of chelsea football club 

* The goal of Chelsea football club is to win games and trophy, no that's the goal of every football club. it doesn't matter if it's by winning like Barcelona or doing it like United are currently doing.

&gt; the defense's job is to try and make sure we keep a clean sheet every game.

* The same thing can be said for the strikers. Torres should score every game but he's not, that what we've been trying to say but you guys just wouldnt listen. You think the defense should keep clean sheet every game but wouldn't admit that Torres should score everygame.

&gt;if you keep winning 3-2 4-3 and people don't care it just encourages complacency,

* Really dont understand what you are trying to say ther. Because i too will be satisfy if we can win all our 38 epl games 3-2, or 4-3.

&gt; defending is good habits repeated,

* Scoring is also a good habit repeated.

&gt;repeatedly a good defense will constantly keep clean sheets through sheer grit and determination

* repeatedly a good striker will constantly score no matter how bad his defense is fucking up. Torres doesnt have the sheer grit or determination to do that.

But you cannot blame them for Torres poor form. Torres wasnt at fault today. (except that ball he shot wide after dribbling past two defenders and throwing a perfect cross away that he could have easily put on Ba head) Neither was the defense. what we lacked is consistency and dedication.

Further back, the Norman Invasion of 1066 would have probably been a routine thing without the channel.

And even further, the Roman Invasion of Britain would have no doubt happened a lot sooner too.

Great Britain might not have even developed a prominent sea-faring community if we had less need of it too, resulting in less colonialisation, changing things for the Americas, Austrailia, India, etc and throughout the latter half of the Second Millenium.

Henry VIII may not have broken away from the Catholic Church with France and Spain within marching distance, resulting in a more unified Europe, at least for longer. That would change if or when the Puritans set sail to start up the seeds that would become the USA.

Yes, he's underperforming - he was the best player on the field his first few games. But the jumble of positions, players, and tactics have made it difficult for any of our midfielders to get comfortable. Honestly, we have been weak in this area all season - BR can't seem to find the right balance.

I'll say it again, a proper creative AM alleviates a lot of that burden - links the midfield to the attack, provides hold up play, and (ideally) adds composure under pressure. Think Suso in 3 years (hard to believe that would just put him at 22!).

Extensive research, notably by [Ole Fanger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._Ole_Fanger) in the 1970s, has found that, whether you are from Africa or Russia, one's comfort temperature range is very similar. It actually varies more due to individual differences, such as body fat percentage and metabolic rate, rather than where you are from. Physiologically our responses to cold and heat are fairly similar wherever we come from in the world.

What does vary, of course, is how people respond to changes in weather in terms of their behaviour. Your body is perfectly capable of regulating your temperature in a wide range of climates. When you go outside, it will feel chilly for the first 10 minutes or so but then your body will pull blood back from your extremities and reduce blood flow to the skin and you will feel comfortable again. Remember not to stand around when you are outside but move briskly to your destination.

You being from Texas doesn't change your body's response - physiologically you are much the same as a Brit.

I stand by the point in general, though.  Tom's not a great tackler - certainly not by the standards of an actual DM - or a masterful positional defender.

Scotty is a more energetic and powerful box-to-box MF, but he lacks the creativity and dribbling of Dembélé.

Which part of the country are you located in? it's -2C where I am which ain't bad. It was -5C yesterday which meant the ice was hard to remove from the car windows.

I've been here since April last year, and I'm from Sydney, Australia. I'm wearing:

Top: long sleeved cotton blend office shirt, thin woollen jumper, woollen jacket/short-coat

Bottoms: briefs, work trousers - these are a little cold. if I was going out longer I'd wear thick cotton jeans.

Accessories: medium thickness cotton blend socks from the local market (18 for £5), [Blundstone boots](http://www.blundstone.com/au/classic-boots/classics-lifestyle-boots).

I've got a beanie (hat) if I have to spend more time outside or if it's windy. I'm not much of a fan of gloves and my hands have already acclimatised to the weather.

If it gets much colder, I'll usually zip up my coat. ;)

This in itself is not enough to condemn it, however. What rustles me more about our lotteries isn't the unsound economics of buying a ticket (or even that it's a state-run monopoly) but rather the painfully transparent faux-philanthropic way it manages to evade all criticism by talking about the ""good causes"" it is helping.

Has our discourse become so relative and non-judgemental that when we are told that the lottery does some good, however slight, we are willing to forgive all of the bad? Isn't there something fundamentally dishonest about disguising the avarice and cupidity—that are *surely* the only incentives to play this game—with some feel-good stuff about good casues? And where are the people doing real good in disadvantaged communities complaining about this corrupting lucre, or are they just happy to take the money and don't want to ask too many awkward questions..?

Even defined as a tax it is highly problematic. Far from being progressive, it has always seemed suspect that lottery money is proudly spent on high-brow projects such as art restorations, concert hall restorations and theatre lighting rigs when—without any risk of exaggeration—there is literally zero overlap between the people who would benefit from the project and who funded it.

I would not want to legislate that citizens cannot make dubious investments in any market, let alone a ""lottery market"", but we should at least be able to agree that this nasty regressive tax should enjoy no protection nor special privileges from the state, and it should henceforth be incapable to get away with deflecting all criticism with a bunch of photogenic children from an inner-city estate clutching half a dozen branded footballs.",0,1358416616,null,0,1358420035,0,c7yhmaw,t3_16op7f,t1_c7yhmaw,t3_16op7f,null,1430990455,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Whatever you're opinions, you have to accept that leaving the EU will be utterly poisonous to our economy - it will cost all of us a lot of money.

true,Cicero1,uk,Aberdeen,"&gt;Theft is a worst case scenario though. And there's probably a reasonable defence in the definition of dishonesty in the theft act.

Oh shit you're right, I completely forgot that dishonesty is a consideration in English Law with theft. It isn't something that has been fully explored in Scots Law yet.  

&gt;I wonder about this. It's a moot point since it's simply not worth the cost of making the claim. But assuming they did, there's no question about the fact that HMV also owes a debt to the defendant.

true,keozen,yorkshire,West Yorkshire,"First thing wikipedia says about Statistics:
&gt;Statistics is the study of the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data

The actual full first thing wikipedia says about probability:

&gt;Probability (or likelihood[1]) is a measure of how likely it is that something will happen or that a statement is true. Probabilities are given a value between 0 (will not happen) and 1 (will happen).[2] The higher the probability of an event, the more certain we are that the event will happen.

While statistics and probability are closely related they are not the same thing. Statistics is the study of a particular set of data to judge the likelihood of an outcome based on knowledge of that dataset alone whereas probability is more wide reaching.

As a 29 year old male living in the north of England I am statistically likely to enjoy football and nights out at the pub. As someone who prefers Formula one and a nice whiskey at home the probability of me attending the sky viewing of the next England game is a lot less than the statistical likelyhood based on my age, gender and location would suggest.

We don't have working heat in most of our flat (my husband's family's house has no heat at all), so here's what I wear at home:

Bottom: leggings, thermal underwear, fleece pajamas, long thick knee socks. Grab a hot water bottle. Boil the kettle, then put water in hot water bottle 20 minutes later. Replace every 2 hours or as needed. Get in a thick sleeping bag with a high GSM. 

Your duvet should also have a high GSM (they're on sale this time of year). You can place your sleeping bag on top of the duvet at night. If you can afford it, you can also try a electric mattress protector -- you'll be just like a lizard on a hot rock.

Gerrard isn't as athletic as used to be and playing in that role doesn't require him to be busting a gut as much as he used to. He's also very physical as opposed to Allen who can be a bit lightweight when playing deep in midfield.

He can play a number of roles in midfield, but if he stays disciplined enough to play only one role and not lose his head and attempt to do everything (super Gerrard I call him when he does this) he could be very effective in that deep playmaker role.

Lucas and Gerrard playing deep with a #10 in front of them with excellent ball control, passing, ability to create space to unlock defenses and link midfield to the forwards would be a nice midfield to have, someone with a  similar skill set to Ozil or Silva.

The front three then could be Sturridge in the middle, Suarez as an inside forward on the left and allow him to roam about and Sterling/Borini/New Signing on the right, all three don't have to be rooted to their position really and swap if needed during the match.
