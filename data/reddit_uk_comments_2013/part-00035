When me &amp; my idiot mates were in our late teens &amp; early twenties we were young, dumb and full of... naive enthusiasm. 

Now I'm pretty mild-mannered, but between us we let off steam in all sorts of ways. Drink, drugs, dancing, fights, fucking anyone that didn't have the good sense to poke us in the eye, you name it. Almost all of it pretty good natured and fun, I'm pleased to say.

I wonder what might have happened to all that youthful energy and righteous enthusiasm, if we'd not had the outlets for it that we did. 

I wonder if it's entirely a co-incidence that the outlets I'm referring to are off limits to religious zealots and cultural imperialists of *all* persuasions. 

I'm *not* saying that dickwitted debauchery is laudable for its own sake. Frankly I'm finished with it and could do with less of it about the place while I'm returning my library books and queuing for the opera. (Kids: take up sport. Have a wank.)

I *am* saying that I feel kind of sorry for those guys. Because they really just seem to be stupid young twats, who were impressionable, stupid and full of zeal, and in the wrong place, at the wrong time.

I used to be a stupid young twat. Don't think I was *evil*. Frankly I don't think these guys were, either.

I *do* think the consequences of their actions could have been horrendous, and they should be held accountable for what they did - which was planning an atrocity. But it's the reaction, the way we talk about it that concerns me. 

These guys aren't *monsters* and the British press shouldn't talk about them as if they are. If we learned one lesson from the twentieth century, it should be that you *don't* denigrate the humanity of *anybody*. We saw what happened to a nation that did that, and it's also what religious fundamentalists sets out to do. 

If we do it, as a reaction to them, a cycle is continued. We can break it.

true,EnglishMD,null,null,"Firstly with FFP, it's quite a complex situation. For one, any contracts signed pre-2010 don't count towards the end financials, hence why we signed all our big names up on long term deals before then. Our paltry profit of £1m this season is actually a lot more under FFP accounting, removing the salaries of Didier, Terry, Lampard, Essien etc will run well in to the tens of millions of Pounds. Under FFP clubs can make an average loss of £35m each season for 3 seasons, we're well clear of this. City on the other hand did a lot of their spending after the 2010 cutoff so are more resistant to change. Oh and FFP only looks at recurrent expenses, not one-off expenditures so while amortised transfer fees obviously count, manager payoffs do not (particularly relevant re: AVB)

The previous big money strikers were the right men at the wrong time, both were also Roman vanity purchases. Shevchenko and Torres were clearly past it yet Roman still wanted them, Falcao is a different case and is bang in form now playing at his peak

We've signed a wave of new sponsorship deals this season and I expect more to come, players coming in now are on much less money than the older generation and we're seeing those big money contracts run down now. I'd take a guess and say we're about £30-40m in the clear according to FFP accounting rules, Falcao would take about £20m per annum of that (assuming £50m deal and £200k p/w salary for 5 years) leaving us another £30-40m to play with before we cross the £35m loss threshold, assuming no further rises in commercial income. I've taken in to account the £15m equity write-down from the last accounts there, subtract another £15m from our bottom line for not winning the CL in a future season but these together are canceled out by the new TV deal which will bring in an extra £30m or so by itself.

Remind me who has the nukes and which head of state has been agitating for their use? Which un-country is literally being destroyed, bombed, annexed and built on despite all being illegalities under international law? How many journalists have Iranian militants killed this past year? Right now there is greater annihilation in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya. That which is under the greatest threat presently is actually Iran.

&gt; International law provides for the right of nations to exist through several mechanisms such as the right to self-determination, immutability of sovereign affairs, right to self-defense, prohibition of use of force in aggression and the duty of pacific resolution of conflicts.

And Israel breaks all those: wars of aggression and land grabs, assassinations in other countries, and denies Palestine the ""right to exist"" through apartheid.

&gt; You may not grab land that you do not have a previous title to in times of war, and you may not change the ethnic demographics in specific prohibited manner.

Ah yes, the Zionist's ~2000yr old claim to the middle east. I can't say it is Israel's claim because that state didn't exist until the allied forces came in and killed many brown people just after WW2.

&gt; You may not grab land that you do not have a previous title to in times of war, and you may not change the ethnic demographics in specific prohibited manner.=

The international community is clear, that is why Jerusalem isn't recognised as the capital of Israel, and the international courts ruled the occupied territories **including occupied Jerusalem** (which is spelt out leaving no ambiguity) are illegal. 

&gt; This is a false statement.

Politics is a grey, fuzzy affair in the best of cases, but nothing is more certain that Zionism is about supremacy (you said it yourself, pre-Israeli claims to that bit of dirt trumps all others) and Israel is a plague with judeo-fascism.",0,1361476791,null,0,false,0,c8j9ahn,t3_18xlvf,t1_c8j9ahn,t1_c8j3xz6,null,1431364654,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

Israel does. So what? The point of time at which Arabs ceased attempting to annihilate Israel military and switched to attempts to do so politically, legally and with PR coincides exactly with the point of time where the world began believing Israel has nukes. This is a fact. What conclusion do you make of this?

&gt; which head of state has been agitating for their use?

I don't know, which one? 

&gt;  Which un-country is literally being destroyed, bombed, annexed and built on despite all being illegalities under international law?

You are repeating as fact the central point of contention, namely that ""Palestine"" is somehow owned exclusively by the Arabs and any Jewish settlement behind the borders of Israel is unlawful. The actual law is very different.

&gt; How many journalists have Iranian militants killed this past year? 

One. There isn't a civil war or an armed conflict going on. Freedom of speech is suppressed through intimidation and imprisonment, not outright killing. The journalists that get killed by Israel forces, on the other hand, are entering a war zone, and it is not a seldom occurence to see them come into Gaza or West Bank specifically to fabricate sympathy to Palestinians where none is due [example](http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=7&amp;x_issue=39&amp;x_article=2002). What is your point?

&gt; That which is under the greatest threat presently is actually Iran.

Correct, because Iran is a fascist theocracy that sponsors worldwide terrorism and shiite fundamentalism. Its hands can be found everywhere from [Darfur genocide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Sudan_relations) to Hezbollah, sponsorship of slaugher in Syria and, of course, weapon shipments to criminal organization with the stated goal of total genocide you know as Hamas, nevermind half a dozen of terrorist attacks against random Israeli civilians, more of them than not botched by Iran's eagerness to show teeth and incompetence, which would be hilarious were it not for the fact it is terrifying. It *should* be under threat. It *shouldn't* be allowed to possess means to defend itself adequately because it may become necessary to use force to topple the Iranian regime which is incompatible with modern civilized world. What was your point?

&gt; And Israel breaks all those: wars of aggression and land grabs, assassinations in other countries, and denies Palestine the ""right to exist"" through apartheid.

False. The allusions to war of aggression (aside of 1952 and 1956, when Israel was less than ten year old  and vulnerable and was easily swayed by foreign pressure and internal power struggles) are based on want, not on fact. In 1947, 1967 and in 1973 wars were initiated by the Arabs, and no amount of backpedalling is able to conceal this recorded fact. ""Land grabs"" are, in fact, on the territory of Palestine that was lawfully allocated as the ground for ""reconstitution of Jewish national home"", language of treaty, where Arabs have no right to prevent the Jews frmo settling. Assassinations in other countries are assassinations of people who represent a direct threat, such as the assassination of Suleimani and Mabhouh, and while perhaps technically illegal, few Israelis would condemn them, because the people on the receiving end were, by any objective measure, evil, and modern international law provides exactly zero means of recourse for a state engaged in asymmetric warfare against a non-state actor. Palestine, it is a fact, has *no* right to exist as far as law is concerned, because such a right begins at the conception of a de jure state, a notion that is sought by the Arabs in words byt utterly rejected in their acts, for any configuration that does not ensure the strengthening of position that allows to facilitate the expansion of struggle against Israel is detrimental to the interests of Arab powers. Palestinian people have a right to self-determination. That does not mean that such a right can be applied in any arbitrary territory and its mere existence does not translate into nullification of Jewish claims to the land, which is why Israel demands that any final settlement should be done through direct bilateral negotiation. That the Palestinian governance abuses the false desire to have a state as a means to maintain a low-burn conflict is something that has been known to zionists for fifty years. Palestinians did everything in their power to *prevent* the emergence of a Palestinian state for the fear that such an act would undermine the continuity of their ""struggle"" and confer a recognition on the legitimacy of zionism - which is exactly the main demand in  all Israeli demands, case in point: waves of terrorist attacks by PLO and Hamas almost immediately after the Oslo accords, total rejection of every Israeli offer and not a single specific counteroffer by Palestinian governance, Abbas' demand to freeze settlement expansion as a precondition that yielded no negotiation but excuses from the PA after *ten* months of voluntary Israeli moratorium, should I go on?

&gt; Ah yes, the Zionist's ~2000yr old claim to the middle east.

To the land rightfully seen as the birthplace of the Jewish people, as defined to be Palestine between the Paris Peace Conference and the San Remo Conference, excluding the territory allotted to Jordan by art. 25 of the British Mandate, yes. To the ""middle east"", no. Why do you have to exaggerate? Do you have any substantial objection to the actual claim that is based on fact?

&gt;  I can't say it is Israel's claim because that state didn't exist until the allied forces came in and killed many brown people just after WW2.

That is so far the dumbest and most ignorant thing said in this entire thread. What you just said is arbitrary and imaginary.

&gt; The international community is clear, that is why Jerusalem isn't recognised as the capital of Israel

The international community has no standing to recognize or not recognize capitals of any nations. Political desires are not identical to legal obligations.

&gt;  and the international courts ruled the occupied territories including occupied Jerusalem 

*One* international court - ICJ ruled so in a *single* advisory, non-binding (meaning it does not require anyone to do anything, not even the Court itself) ruling, where Israel was not allowed to represent itself, and [*falsely*](http://www.mythsandfacts.org/ReplyOnlineEdition/toc.html) so. What you just did is taking one lie and multiplying it by unspecific many in order to create an air of legitimacy where none is justified.

&gt;  nothing is more certain that Zionism is about supremacy (you said it yourself, pre-Israeli claims to that bit of dirt trumps all others) and Israel is a plague with judeo-fascism.

I would drag you face first through the works of the founding intellectuals of Zionism, from Hertzl to Borokhov to Jabotinsky, just like one drags a pet through the heap of dung it made in order to teach not to do it again, so that the pompous and revolting extent of your baseless ignorant fantasies became as obvious to you as it is shameful ; alas, I do not truly expect any education to settle in you.

You do realise that fascists will pretend to not be horrible when they're speaking in public..? At the moment in France (and other countries, Greece especially) racists like Le Pen are allowed to discuss they're views publically, they are given a 'platform'. The result is a creeping tendency in society for racist, anti-immigrant views to become unchallenged and publically acceptable. Which ultimately (if left unchallenged) will lead to a lot of fucking death. History has definitely shown us this.

We don't have a large problem in this country with far-right main-stream politics, but that won't continue if you start giving hate-speech a platform. Considering we're in a triple recession and people are becoming increasingly desperate. 

Lastly, I'd like to leave you with a quote from Hitler, of all people: 

""Only one thing could have stopped our movement - if our adversaries had understood its principle and from the first day smashed with the utmost brutality the nucleus of our new movement.""

true,Tattoo__,null,null,"I came to address the final quirk that I couldn't think an answer for in my previous answer.

In my opinion, fixed points in time are fixed because they set off a chain of events that have wide-reaching effects. Fixed point that changes does not however immediately cause the whole time stream from that point onwards to rewrite itself. This is evident from the fact that Doctor lives through eg. collapse of time because ""they are at the epicenter"".

The problem is, therefore, how much time you have after changing a fixed point before the next thing that the original fixed point was ment to cause does not (or does differently) before paradoxes start piling up on top of each other? It might be immediate or not that immediate.

For example, Pete Tyler's death has a (pretty) immediate effect on Jackie . If that would not have happened, she would raise Rose differently, which could mean she's not where she is suppose to be when she would meet the Doctor, causing all sorts of paradoxes around time stream where Rose should have been.

On the other hand, saving Adelaide Brooke (in Waters of Mars) does not have immediate effect before e.g. her grand-daughter sees her, which changes her therefore never being the essential person she is in the future of mankind. The fact that no immediate paradox happened is however a fluke; it just so happens to be that Adelaide's tragic suicide still has the effect her original death would have had.

Then again, not shooting the Doctor at Lake Silencio does have repercussions. The death of the Doctor is, what I understand, a universally known historical fact. It might be that now some events that were done because of this knowledge are done so differently that time paradoxes pile up on massive scale, causing all history happening at singular point in time -- 5:02 PM on 22 April 2011

Poppy burning - a few people 

Bombs - 8 years ago, terrible as it was it hasn't been repeated here. The whole of Europe went for years without a single Muslim terrorist incident after that. 

Patrols - two twats that had already been banned from every mosque in London got arrests soon after. 

Mindless riots over cartoons - not in the UK

violence - more than one million dead in two wars, plus 600,000 children in Iraq dead due to sanctions. The same is probably going to happen to iran next. Now that's what I call violence - reloaded. 

Abuse of women - it's another Muslim exclusive, ever heard of Erin pizzey?

Abuse of children - jimmy Saville and the media pedo rings pass you by or are you in on it too?

Failing to integrate - like the British expats in Spain 

Rape - because we'd never heard of that in Britain before had we jack?

The vast majority of Muslims are decent people who live normal lives. They dont support terrorism any more than you do.

Picture modern-day England and/or Albion, going about its day. Cars buzzing around and businessmen walking down the street. Maybe some flashbacks to the wars overseaseas. 

Suddenly you see Arthur gasp. As he sits up, he sees Merlin sitting there. 

""Hello sire! How did you sleep""- Says Merlin.

""Merlin, you worthless sob! I've been dead for a thousand years! Go fetch me some water!""

""Yes, sire"" Merlin replies.

Continue with modern day Merlin. Obviously, Merlin is now a great wizard and knows how to adapt his magic to the modern day. Arthur is now retasked with protecting the world from ancient and current evils, but must adapt his fighting style and his attitude to modern times. 

I kind of see it as part Merlin, part Sherlock and part Torchwood. If they do it right, they could make it work.


There are other options they could do. They could wake Arthur up only a few years later, which would work fine. Basically, the last scene in Series 5 shows that Merlin is immortal and will always protect Arthur. Or, Merlin can just do his own adventures without Arthur.

I don't want to get too excited, but performances like that, and Sunday's against Swansea, really make me look forward to next year.

true,this_guy_says,lfc92,,"&gt; 3) I thought the substitutions were odd. I could understand taking off either Allen or Hendo, but both? I think we missed the legs in the end.

A double substitution provides 2 new pairs of legs at the same time, if anything it should've added energy. We lost two hard pressing defenders in Henderson and Allen, but gained a worthy sub in Assaidi and Shelvey who usually gives his all hustling on defence as well...... After rechecking the minute they were subbed in, one of the two subs should've been delayed a bit as in the 60th minute is quite early to have a quick impact as I was suggesting.

edit:
&gt; 4) Shelvey needs a loan or something. Everytime he comes on he seems so raw.

I think the problem is a combination of the fact that he's **young**, started off well and over-performing to a degree, and then declined to his playing level (which is fine for his situation) at the same time others (Henderson, Downing) gained form, all toppled by the criticism he then received. He's fine for what his role in the club is.

Germany have already spent a similar amount (€100bn over the last decade) and while on a sunny day they get 50% of their power from solar it still only amounts to 4% of their total electric consumption (about the same as two large nuclear power stations). Not a great return from €100bn. Also our grid is not designed for distributed generation. It's designed for large central power stations feeding power down to local networks. The grid operators have kittens if you install just a couple of solar systems in one street. So the bill for upgrading the grid will also rack up into several billions. If I was to drop £100bn I would build 5 nuclear power stations and spend the rest tackling the shocking state of our housing stock.

It is a job for the police and security services to find those who are plotting attacks and to prevent them from doing so, they have been successful, there haven't been any attacks in years. Europe has a bigger problem with separatists than Muslims. 

Muslims IMO get an unfair rap, they are constantly demonised in the media and the vast majority are decent people. It's every single day that we see negative stories about Muslims. Why don't they focus on the 99% that don't support terrorism and work hard and don't break the law. It wouldn't be interesting for one and secondly it wouldn't fit the rhetoric. In my honest opinion it seems like a propaganda campaign. 

As for integration before 9/11 nobody even cared much about Muslims, we were still getting over the IRA campaigns. Since 9/11 the Muslims in Britain have had all sorts of accusations thrown at them, the country has divided down religious lines, we've seen the formation of the EDL, their religion is constantly insulted and people have been arrested on the weakest of evidence (the infamous old Trafford bomb plot springs to mind). Integration is a two way thing and if the local natives distrust you then you are on a hiding to nothing. I'd be a bit freaked if one day half the country despised me because of actions I didn't do and crazy beliefs I don't agree with. 

With regards salafism, I agree I don't see a valid place for that innovation outside Muslim lands. This is a liberal western society and if you want to live like its the 7th century, you might be better off moving to a Muslim land because there is going to be a conflict In this one, the principles really dont fit. Unfortunately Muslims are the ones that suffer the most from salafism ideology

He tends to drop off and play deep and shy away from the ball. Managers will defend Forwards who do this by arguing that they make attacking plays happen, creating opportunities. It's an ongoing argument, probably always will be. What I will say though is that if you're going to criticise Torres for it, this wouldn't be the most opportune moment. After all, he **didn't** demand a cross and head it wide. He **didn't** pick the ball and sky it. He **did** try to draw his man in order to create space for Hazard. And we **did** score a goal from the play, so if anything, this is one example of when Torres' controversial method of play actually paid off for us. For the record, I completely understand your lack of enthusiasm for his style of play -- he's not exactly got that Drogba-esque goal hunger.

This year? We came out firing in the second half, and though it took us until the 89th minute, we managed to break them down through constant pressure. Lyon had very few good chances in the second half because we just absolutely dominated.

    * Doctor who 50th coming
    * More than one 60 minute special
    * Sherlock filming in a month
    * 3D is going to be logistically difficult
      - Double the CGI will be more expensive
    * There will be a 2013 Christmas Special
    * Moffat was skeptical of the return of the Ice Monsters, Mark Gaitiss convinced 
      Moffat otherwise during Sherlock conversation
    * Vastra and Strax returned due to great fan reaction
      - Moffat really likes Vastra, and how refined she is
      - He also things Strax is hilarious
    * Moffat thinks the Master was a bit cartoony, but liked what RTD did with it,
      but ended the Master's story, but it's still not off the table
    * Moffat is making series 7 more stand-a-lone to mix it up, thinks both styles great
    * Moffat wants RTD to return, but he's not having it at the moment
    * Moffat says Matt Smith will be staying forever
    * ""Journey to the Center of the Tardis"" will be about the center of the Tardis
      - It grew from Moffat's disappointment of a classic episode that promiesed the
      center of the Tardis but didn't really deliver
    * Moffat says ""The Empty Child"" changed a lot from script to screen
    * Moffat talks some about prescriptiveness of scripts
      - He thinks good scripts can be as good as the film version
      - He says the description is the most important
    * Moffat not revealing whether Zygons are returning
    * Moffat first states that his favorite episode he wrote
      is ""Blink"" partially because people told him it was the best one.
      - He thought it was good, but not great at first
      - His least favorite was ""The Beast Below""

But fine, if GG doesn't want to debate with Israelis he doesn't have to.

 I don't know his intention is about publicity. The debate was going to get publicity whether Levy's israeli or not. I mean, what did Galloway expect when he entered a debate on the West Bank? That there wouldn't be an opposition? He's clearly willing to legitimize the opposing ideology enough to engage with it in a public forum. Just as long as the opponent isn't Israeli. That's what is so weird.

I'd buy the Apartheid analogy better if my friend were some government official. But he's not. He's a uni student. Even BDS thinks this is ridiculous, and they released a [statement](http://www.bdsmovement.net/2013/bds-movement-position-on-boycott-of-individuals-10679) today recognizing the distinction between ""official representatives"" and normal folk: ""BDS does not call for a boycott of individuals because she or he happens to be Israeli or because they express certain views. "" 

I can see what Galloway was trying to do, but he's imagining that he didn't agree to the debate and it was with Netanyahu. It's just with a student who happens to be Israeli. He doesn't represent Israel.

The vast majority of news is negative about someone or something, saying ""today, 99% of (insert ethnic or religious group here) went about their business as usual"" isn't a story. Maybe you're right about other sources like the Mail and such. 

I'd also argue that Islam isn't criticised any more than Christianity is and that it's less capable of accepting criticism than most other religions. For example, the writer/historian Tom Holland made a documentary for Channel 4 in which he academically explored and questioned the origins of Islam. Muslim clerics threw a shitfit about it and declared it blasphemous, forcing channel 4 to cancel the repeat. These clerics are community leaders, they could at least show an example by taking criticism in a mature and reasoned fashion. Because in a secular society, you are allowed to question and criticise religious belief.

Edit: Here is a great example of a Muslim taking criticism reasonably. If only it was all like this http://www.mohammedamin.com/Reviews/In-the-Shadow-of-the-Sword.html

Sure, we should take positive from tonight because the team put up a hell of a fight, but can you imagine the belief the squad would have gained from this? It would have laid down a marker for what we are about and that Rodgers can take us to the level we want to reach. The fans needed it too, Anfield has seemed quiet at times this season, the fans also need reminding that we are a huge club in temporary decline, rather than a terminal downfall. 

That being said, the squad can only learn from this. It would be unreasonable to expect such a young and scarce squad to win the Europa League (to think, Zenit are a CL quality side and yet we had them trembling). Rodgers, also, will gain from this. Especially from tonight when his subs almost killed our momentum. Nevertheless, he was brave, and if Shelvey's shot had gone in we'd be calling him a genius.

Half heartedly to be honest but cheered none the less.

When Lamps scored we looked down and I flashed a smile at my brother. 

Holy fucking SHIT when Bridge scored. My legs started to shake. I was close to pissing myself (I was only 6-7).

This is actually one thing I've been particularly hoping for for the 50th... I don't know how likely it would be, because first you've got to have a multi-doctor episode, which I'm optimistic about but is by no means a certainty, then that episode has to include McGann and Eccleston, then you've got to work in the regeneration scene. But yeah - if I could pick one scene to see in the 50th anniversary series, it would be a flashback to the 8/9 regeneration.

That's an interesting idea by the way, and I think that would make the 10th Doctor's pre-death scene kind of interesting, that he's tried suicide before, and just when he's got somewhere he feels kind of better/more stable/more wanting-to-continue (if lonely) after Rose and Donna and everyone picked him up, it's taken away from him again. I kind of like the idea of there being that bitter irony in his mind as he's running around trashing the office, it kind of makes his frustration and his utter devastation more... understandable?

I agree that it might not fit into the Doctor's general personality, but if you think, Simm's Master established that a Time Lord can choose not to regenerate, so the Doctor would have had to kill himself at first but then decide against it and let himself regenerate, which I think would be much more consistent with his personality (that he was miserable and guilty enough to do it but not able to give up living and all it's opportunities when it came to it).

Though come to think of it, if the doctor did try to commit suicide, I'm not sure I'd want to see that for the 50th... a bit dark for a celebration, and not a good Vashta-Nerada, 'Don't Blink' kind of dark.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"Yup this is pretty spot on.

We haven't really been able to utilize Dempsey this season the way Fulham used him last year.  Defoe had a stretch of bad form, Ade has more or less had a season of bad form and with Bale and Lennon being fantastic it has meant we haven't been able to utilize him from the wings.  Meaning we have had a proven goal poacher that we have been trying to wedge into the lineup where we can. so i think part of his problem is that we just haven't been able to use him effectively with the squad we regularly field.

That said Dempsey hasn't really been in great form for a little bit.  The thing about being a pretty solid goal poacher is that people will forgive 89min of uselessness if you can put the ball int he back of the net in the 90th.  Dempsey has had more than a few games where he has been completely anonymous for the majority of the game, including games where he has notched goals so we forgive him for the games where he notched the goals, but looking at it his performance may have been very similar to the games that he didn't score a goal.

The whole attack has looked piss poor for a stretch here, but Dempsey hasn't contributed anything to make it look threatening.  We really need to get Ade or JD or Kane or whoever to start giving us some production up top.

&gt; We are definitely shopping for a center back. There was the Forren trial and the links to Diakite, who is not only an excellent CB but is running his current deal down. It is viable to get him in during the current window. I think moving Coates out on loan to West Brom or Wigan with a buy option would be dependant on getting one of Diakite, Fazio, Astori, Targett or outsiders Rodriguez (Fiorentina - having a hell of a season) and Flores (urgh, Swansea again)

Except i'll now add Ashley Williams and Sakho to that list. I think Diakite is the most likely.

Carragher retiring, Coates will likely be moved on or loaned out for a season, which suggests that we are in the market for two centerbacks, possibly three (although you never want to be in that situation). We have been very thin in our back 5 this season as a squad, a decent first-choice lineup but absolutely no depth.

If the government wants higher quality food it should renegotiate the contracts and pay more, I know one catering company in a hospital near me that gets paid 50 pence per person per meal by the government, that doesn't go very far but they still work miracles.

I am writing in response to the job advertisement that you published in the Guardian. I like how you've tried to expand into employing actual talent there, but I honestly don't think that the type of people that read the Guardian would really be too interested in writing for the Daily Mail; below them, perhaps?  


I digress, I would be very interested in the opportunity to be able to write quality journalism for your much respected and sourced tabloid as I am incredibly interested, as a student and lover of the everything English, to be able to consequently throw away all my morals and dignity to be the author of literature, of a level which is nearly matched by a children's story book, that causes public outrage with speculation and lies. 


I feel that this would be the perfect job for me and that I would be able to integrate myself neatly with your current staff as I would consider myself a very politically savvy left-winger who is willing to do whatever it takes to get a scoop; even if it means phone hacking. Unfortunately I do not possess any degree of journalism experience, but my English teacher once said to me that I would make a good journalist one day if I ever chose to take a route down that career path. Gracefully, this is a route that may have possibly come open to me with this vacancy! I look forward to hear back from you.


 Yours sincerely,
A person with intelligence and a functioning moral compass.""

true,swertsta,null,null,"My diagnosis. 

RdM, AvB and Rafa have all suffered from chelsea's midfield personnel problem when Ballack and Deco left they were never replaced. The problem Chelsea has is I believe with KdB, McEch or Chalobah that one of these players will hold the key as well with Oscar who I believe to develop to a more central role. Now the problem this season is getting rid of Essien and Meireles who were on the fringe enough to get rid of at the end of this season, now the alternative is to buy a player but then we just ruin another youngsters potential at the club which I think chelsea wish to avoid doing. 

Their is a player problem, mentality problem if you ask me. The player's dont want to perform for the manager anymore. The problem is they have a bit too much power and they truly don't work hard enough anymore. I was watching an analysis of the Bayern - Arsenal match from a popular Australian analyst and he highlighted Bayern's defensive work. When Bayern turned the ball over, nearly every player except the striker and the two centre backs who were already in position sprinted back to defend at full pace. Now Bayern has flair players Robben, Ribery, Kroos, Muller etc who you would compare to Hazard, Mata and Oscar etc, frankly they don't put the hard shift in. Now it's all well and good to say it's not their job or the holding players should be better but fuck that shit, the whole team should know by now we struggle defending counter attacks. They should put the hard yards in we are a team, they're team mates they want to win, you saw the effort last season in the champions league when we did it yes it's hard work and if it's too hard to do week in week out get a bigger squad if it meant we would seriously challenge for more trophies and everyone would get more game time.

There also seems to be a lack of accountability. This is caused by the owner power and the so called player power. Back in the ol days Mourinho would take players off at half time if they were doing shit, that never happens now. You hear stories that Mourinho would rigorously make players learn defensive tactics of a sheet before even being allowed to train. Every player knew of the role required of them and stuck to it. A couple of weeks ago maybe a bit longer don't remember the game I saw Lampard in the midfield give the ball away trying to dribble he then just casually stopped and started jogging back meanwhile Torres of all people sprinted past him and tried getting the ball back, I think he committed a foul but who cares. This type of crap goes on, with zero accountability. 

Now you have players who can oust a manager AvB I'm talking about. Which was a good thing in hindsight but you also have this power from Roman and the board that if the players stuff up the manager is gonna get the axe. I am a die hard Torres sympathizer if you will, I will admit he should have been sacked or in the reserves after two years of awful performances but half the problem is the owner much like with Shevchenko  went this player looks shiny, I want him. There was no thought about would they work, what role they would play in the team if we even needed them. Literally zero thought it was like this player is shiny I love watching him play I will love watching him play at chelsea. Now they have put thought into recently purchasing more technical players but it's too late, Nando probably would start declining now even if he was on form. Yes we don't have a strategy. Nando even though didn't overly impress at the Euro's you can tell, when he plays for Spain he generally knows exactly what he has to do.

 I couldn't care if Nando never scored another chelsea goal if he had a clear defined role in the team and it helped the team win. If they said we want you to chase every defender trying to play it out the back and run the channels all day to drag defenders out of position and it helped chelsea win I would be happy. And this goes for any chelsea player you can see when they play Mata, Hazard and Oscar together. The manager must be thinking if they are on the pitch by magic by their ability fairy dust will poof every time they touch the ball and magically we will win. You can see a difference night and day for example when Moses is in the team the players know hes going to get to the by line and put the RB under pressure and get crosses in. You see a difference when Ba plays the players know we pass it to him the ball will most the time be held up and we can rely on him.

The club seriously lacks direction and tactics. We are clueless. I actually enjoyed when Rafa first took over you could see we tightened up defensively, players would track back. Yes it was fucking boring but you knew what you were going to get and somehow its gone back to lets put players on the pitch and hope magic happens.

true,[deleted],null,null,"With regards criticism of Islam, I think it is possible to challenge everything but tone and setting are incredibly important. Much of the criticism of Islam is done in a very disrespectful virtually rhetorical tone to which it's not possible to respond to without appearing defensive. That said, when things are raised in a respectful manner you'll often get an intelligent response. When you make films and cartoons mocking their religion you can't expect an intelligent response because you are insulting these people, their beliefs, their lifestyle and the core of their identity. The whole country was up in arms when sharia4uk wanted to march through Wootton Bassett because it was an utterly disrespectful act. Muslims have to face that kind of disrespect on a regular basis and if they protest they are condemned for restricting our freedoms and preventing our freedom of speech, see the furore over the government preventing the showing of Geert Wilders anti-Islam film a few weeks before as an interesting contrast. 

Regarding propaganda I think the summary on the Wikipedia page sums it up. 

*Propaganda is a form of communication that is aimed towards influencing the attitude of a community toward some cause or position by presenting only one side of an argument. Propaganda is usually repeated and dispersed over a wide variety of media in order to create the chosen result in audience attitudes.*

*As opposed to impartially providing information, propaganda, in its most basic sense, presents information primarily to influence an audience. Propaganda often presents facts selectively (thus possibly lying by omission) to encourage a particular synthesis, or uses loaded messages to produce an emotional rather than rational response to the information presented. The desired result is a change of the attitude toward the subject in the target audience to further a political, religious or commercial agenda. Propaganda can be used as a form of ideological or commercial warfare.*

Prior to 2001 Muslims weren't really in the news, no one cared too much, the popular media would write about mad-mullahs but other than that they weren't particularly newsworthy.  During the first Iraq war there wasn't the same level of anti-Muslim sentiment, it was the good guys against Saddam, no one was saying religion of peace back then.  During the war in Lebanon there wasnt the anti-muslim sentiment either. Twelve years later and the level of propaganda in the media has increased to a constant and relentless level.  It's been an outright propaganda campaign verging on hate as far as I can see, maybe not in the economist and the guardian but certainly on Fox News and in the sun and the daily mail and the telegraph and these are widely read news sources. The level of anti-Islamic sentiment among the general populace is incredible, you won't see an article about Islam posted on here without someone saying ""religion of peace"" it doesn't matter if its about two individuals calling themselves the Muslim Patrol, it's the religion that is to blame. That is completely unfair, particularly when they aren't even acting in a religious manner.

*Operation Gladio is undisputed historical fact. Gladio was part of a post-World War II program set up by the CIA and NATO supposedly to thwart future Soviet/communist invasions or influence in Italy and Western Europe. In fact, it became a state-sponsored right-wing terrorist network, involved in false flag operations and the subversion of democracy.*

*The existence of Gladio was confirmed and admitted by the Italian government in 1990, after a judge, Felice Casson, discovered the network in the course of his investigations into right-wing terrorism. Italian prime minister Giulio Andreotti admitted Gladio's existence but tried to minimize its significance.*

*The main function of the Gladio-style groups, in the absence of Soviet invasion, seems to have been to discredit left-wing groups and politicians through the use of ""the strategy of tension,"" including false-flag terrorism. The strategy of tension is a concept for control and manipulation of public opinion through the use of fear, propaganda, agents provacateurs, terrorism, etc. The aim was to instill fear into the populace while framing communist and left-wing political opponents for terrorist atrocities.*

It's fascinating stuff to be honest, we had a network of military agents waging a CIA sponsored campaign of terrorism and murder in Europe for many years. Sounds like conspiracy loonbag nonsense but actually really happened.

In 2006 according to an ICM poll after Denmark publish some cartoons 12% of British muslims thought it was right for “demonstrators to carry placards calling for the killing of those who insult Islam”. 13% said it was right “to exercise violence against those who are deemed by religious leaders to have insulted them”. 
http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/146

A 2008 YouGov survey of 600 Muslim students at 30 universities throughout Britain revealed that 32 per cent of Muslim students polled said killing in the name of religion was justified, A third of those polled said they supported a worldwide Islamic caliphate, or government. Just under a quarter did not believe men and women were equal in the eyes of Allah, while 25 per cent said they had little or no respect for homosexuals.
http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jul/27/islam.highereducation

Only this week a muslim student leader was filmed in Manchester saying she would have no problem killing homosexuals.

A 2010  joint survey by the German interior ministry and the Institute for Criminology Research of Lower Saxony (KFN) in Hanover headed by Christian Pfeiffer surveyed  45,000 14 -16 year-olds in 61 cities across Germany between 2007 and 2008. Of these, 10,000 had an immigrant background.  It found that the best adjusted and most integrated immigrants came from non-religious families and the willingness to commit violent crimes grows among young Muslim immigrants in Germany the more religious they become. By comparison, the study found that just the opposite was true for Christian immigrants.  The study suggested those views were transferred to young people at the mosque, whereas non-devout boys picked up more liberal German attitudes. Pfeiffer wrote: 'This is not a problem with Islam, but a problem with their education in Islam.'

In 2006 19% of British muslims surveyed say they respect Osama bin Laden, and 45% thought that 9/11 was a conspiracy between the USA and Israel.

In 2007 a survey of 1,003 Muslims by the polling company Populus through internet and telephone questionnaires found that nearly a third of 16 to 24-year-olds believed that those converting to another religion should be executed.

Seriously, that does *seem* to be the case, but that's not the be-all and end-all. 


**Firstly**, plenty of artists have done in-stores at HMV's flagship stores in the past, but it needs to be more organized. 

I'm not talking about a 50-date tour by Radiohead, but if you give your local managers carte blanche (within budget) to stick a sign in the window saying ""In a band? We want to know!"" then you can start having local talent playing. 

Further up the chain, you organise this around competitions, you get bands to submit demos via social and you showcase them in stores - either one near them, or a flagship. 


**Making in-store connectivity available isn't about having it compete with your online efforts** (Incidentally, HMV needed to do a massive amount more there as well. Why do you think Play.com got popular? Short answer: *Because HMV let them*), it’s about adding to the convenience and making sure customers get a single experience, wherever they decide to shop. 

If you go to Amazon then you have everything ever. Amazon is *quite* good at recommending other items, but it’s far from perfect, which is where the shop’s ability to curate properly comes in. A human decides what is good/important and the staff get a say. 


**Why should working behind a counter *always* be a dead-end McJob? (Why should a McJob in McDonalds be a McJob?)**


Companies need to think about organizational change to rectify this. Yes it’s a tall order, but is it really a bad idea to have someone who worked the floor, got to be store manager and then joined your junior execs? 


If you free up regional branches to organize around local markets then you get people working in there who like the company and have an interest in the industry sector. Can one of them help you out with marketing lists targeted for that store? Well done, now you've got someone with targeted insight working for you, who in a year can come on board as a trainee in your marketing department if they show promise. 

Got employees who can't work their way up or aren't interested in moving up? Fine, treat them decently, don't act like they are mindless drones. Ask them to help organise displays, sort out menus, pick products of the week - what don't you sell that they would buy from you? Ask them. Get them involved so that they can experience a little more job satisfaction. It's hardly revolutionary,it just requires a little bit of vision from those at the top. 


*“Old people and middle-aged mothers”*. Who (I’m generalizing here), would largely come in looking for a particular type of product – maybe a current album as a Christmas gift, or an older greatest hits package? So that’s fine, they ask, you get it ordered and delivered to them, same day/next day (If it’s a gift you offer them a download credit gift card, generic or item specific). 

Finally, **downloading shouldn’t be a competitor; it’s another facet of your business**


This is the fundamental mistake that media companies have made since the dawn of the digital era. 


I think something interesting is the Mary Portas high-street report. It almost completely ignored online, because people think it’s the enemy. It’s not, it’s a way of hooking everything together, and it’s a way of driving footfall to shops. 


It’s another aspect of a single business strategy, and ignoring that is a very dangerous, very blinkered view. It’s there and it can be exploited by everyone – and yes, I’m serious. *Every* local shop has the ability to put in two hours of work and have a functioning mobile experience by this Monday. **All of them**. If you don’t, that’s down to you not bothering to learn something that can help your business. 


Downloads are a channel, they are about convenience, which makes your stores about branding, not about primary sales. Yes you can flog something, but if HMV had bothered to create a cool experience that resonated with the 14/15 year old music fanatics out there, they’d have brand loyalty for life from those people, whether they shopped in-store or online. If you care about music, or film, or anything else, then having a place where you can go and have people recommend new things, where you can serendipitously discover new things you might enjoy, with your friends, then you’re onto a winner.  

**All of this is totally possible, now.**


Small businesses have the agility to provide something unique, larger businesses have the ability to stop thinking of themselves as a pyramid where what the boss says goes, and start thinking about themselves as a network, with customers interacting with different points for different reasons, born out of convenience. It’s hard work, but it can be done with a bit of trust and willing.

true,MeanMrMustardMan,lfc55,,"I have played sports all my life- baseball, basketball, volleyball, golf, american football, football, but i was never a very big football fan until 2009. High quality football is just not accessible in the US, and I didn't really understand the sport until a healthy dose of FIFA.

I'm 20 for a frame or reference on what these dates would mean in relation to your age. 

I remember watching parts of the 2002 World Cup, I remember the final of the 2006 World Cup, but I was never into the games. Then in 2009, my aunt was visiting from Boston (I live in California) and insisted we watch the Confederations Cup (at the time I didn't know my aunt was a Liverpool fan since the '80s). Spain vs New Zealand, the game were Fernando dropped a hat trick in like 16 minutes was the first game I really paid attention to. I was impressed- it was a lopsided, albeit exciting game. That planted the seed but my football addiction didn't sprout until 2010. Sadly, I missed the joys and the heartbreak of the US's runner-up finish in that tournament. 

I watched the US vs England game (ROBERT GREEN!!!!) with a good friend, but I was in the middle of watching all 24 hours of the Le Mans race on a second screen(I'm an Audi and Team Corvette fan) so I didn't pay much attention to it. On the eve of the US vs. Algeria game, I learned how to play FIFA. As a very well versed gamer, I immediately thought 'This is the best sports video game in existence, if the sport translates this well to gaming, it must be pretty awesome once I really get to know it.' The next logical step was to pick a team.

Growing up in America in the 2000s you see a lot bandwagon fans wearing Man U, Chelsea and Real Madrid kits, so naturally I knew to stay way from them. I've always been a massive Beatles fan (I don't know who they pulled for, I don't care if they were all die-hard Everton supporters) and I still had Fernando in my mind, so I picked Liverpool as my team. 

My soccer interest was growing, and I was lucky enough to go see Real Madrid play against Club America in San Francisco. Ronaldo scored on a free kick, and I believe Higuain had a brace. Side note on Ronaldo: he hustled his ass off for 73' minutes in a friendly just for the fans. I didn't like him at the time (I obviously appreciated his skill, but not his character) but after that I have respected him quite a lot. 

The season began, and it was the Roy Hodgson era. I had a fairly new Torres kit, which almost immediately became irrelevant, and the team stunk it up that year. And the next year. And this year too. But I'm in it for the long-haul. I had fallen in love with the teams lore, the crest, the colors, the stadium- by far the most compelling in the premier league. 

I was talking to my aunt and I learn she's a big Liverpool fan, and I had the honor of seeing them for the first time against AS Roma at Fenway. I hope to make it to Anfield before a massive renovation or new stadium (which in my opinion we need- for the money's sake). 

I've been a Liverpool fan through some pretty shitty times, but this team is stuck with me and I with it. I'm very glad I picked the right team, that's all I have to say. I have not met any American Liverpool fan that is not worth knowing- the same cannot be said about Chelsea or ManUre supporters.

true,Glavespian,eng-GreaterLondon,London,"I personally think that we need to decide what we want from maths education. We'll never be able to compete with Asian and even other European countries with the way we currently teach maths. But I don't think it's a good idea to move to a curriculum which focuses just on speed and learning as much maths as possible.

The current approach doesn't work though. Speaking from personal experience, the best students are left bored and unchallenged in lessons, and there isn't even any encouragement to challenge yourself outside of the classroom. While the worst at maths are given the most attention, it is ultimately fruitless, with pupils who already find the subject incredibly dull and useless unable to find the motivation to catch up. Even the students in the middle tend to have the attitude that maths lessons are boring and useless.

I'd personally prefer to see pure maths become A Level only. Maths lessons would be integrated into science ones, resolving the complaint of maths being too abstract with meaningful questions from physics say, rather than silly word problems. The A Level would become one focused on proof and the beauty of maths contrary to the current computation style boredom. While a maths A Level in this style would have a huge fall in numbers taking it, that would line up with the low numbers taking maths at university.

The passing out from the back is suicidal if you ask me.

Just fucking kick it out. Im not saying to do that all the time, but some situations require re-grouping. Also, when we desperately need a goal and its in stoppage time, why pass the ball around on the edge of our own area until the ref blows his whistle? Most, if not all, of extra time was in our half (with half of Zenits team I might add) because we refused to kick it up field, in those situations you dont have time to build a beautiful goal, there's nothing wrong with doing a Stoke and hoping to get a lucky break, especially when Zenit were being silly and pressing in our half, it would have taken out half their team with one ball.

as 80% agreeing with *""Western society may not be perfect but Muslims should live within it and not seek to bring it to an end""*

as 82% believing *it was wrong to attack Danish embassies because of the mohamed cartoons.*

a whole 4% agreeing with *""For Al-Qa'eda or those sympathetic to Al Qa'eda to attack Western targets""*

1% (4 people out of 500) agreeing with  *""it was right for Muslims to have bombed London on 7/7 and 21/7""*, ironically double the number of these people intended to vote conservative than labour.

With 91% saying they *felt loyal to Britain....*

Thats just from the first few pages, I shalln't go on.

Just this 

The question wasn't as simple as would you want Sharia law implemented in the UK ?

""Would you support or oppose there being areas of Britain which are pre-dominantly Muslim and in which Sharia law is introduced?""

That could mean many things and isn't quite as simple as is made out.

true,Variola13,null,null,"My own very anecdotal view is that here children have compulsory subjects that could really do with being options. Example: My son (16) is in the top set for maths, and is predicted a B grade, but his teacher says he could easily get an A if he tries. But in his school they have to learn RE, (which he hates), Business Communication and PE as compulsory subjects, along with PHSE (personal health and social education). The religious studies is pointless, awareness and appreciation of different religions and cultures could be taught within the realms of PHSE, but they don't need to know the in depth history behind the religions. The could also teach ethics and citizenship within it too, instead of separate courses. Bis Comm seems a bit odd to me, it includes IT, and they all get a GCSE type award in it, but it doesn't seem to focus much on what I would deem 'essentials. It seems to focus more on the business side rather than the IT side, that is desirable if you are going to work in a business environment but not as much use as the IT skills.  I am not a techy by *any* means, but I expected my son to be able to input data into excel and be able to create and annotate a chart/graph with it, but he didn't know how to, they hadn't been shown how to do it in Bis Com and he hadn't needed to use it in any lessons. He is also coming top in the sciences, to my mind, knowing how to use excel is essential for any science. 

This of course is all my own view based on my experience as a parent, but I know my boy would rather be doing more maths than learning about religion or how a company might market their idea on a web. Religion and Bis comm could be taken as options, if that is what direction the kids want to go in, but less 'compulsory' teaching of anything other than English, Maths and Science would be beneficial IMO.

I also believe that by only understanding these primal instincts in lay can one be wholly faithful because with self awareness comes recognition hence an inert ability to plan ahead. so just be clear I am not attempting to justify why men cheat merely attempting to identify why we do!

Most of the money in banks is not *your* money. Unless you happen to own a super-corporation. Or another bank. The amount an individual contributes on average to a bank is very little.

Banks are, mostly, private institutions. You cannot just say ""do this, do that"" any more than you can tell any company or corporation.  You cannot also just say ""we own you now"", because that's tyrannical. Nationalisation of Northern Rock occurred when the government became the sole shareholder (as custodians for the public).

&gt;Even the supermarket cannot tell you which factory made something unless that company has just one factory who does

If the retailer does not know where the product is made, why the when we fill out an RP125 (customer complaint form) do we send it off to the factory that made it for testing. 

Yes indeed it is commercially sensitive but i can be found out. Nothing in the world of food is ever ""trace free"" purely and simply because of the nature of the area the work in. 

Also yes researchers may not be able to find out they're client list, but they would be able to find out how the products are made. Where it was stored, and where it was distributed from. The reasons for this are simple **accountability** to be able to trace back to the person who is responsible when mistakes are made. 

Also i would like to point out the fact that if indeed the supermarket does not know where they're products are made, why then have they been able to trace back  where this horse meat is coming from and also why have the retailers been able to point fingers. This also shows a lack of research and understanding in your comment.

a legal obligation? I was bullied in school, can I sue them for failing in their legal obligations?

well it certainly shouldn't; but I don't see how an act of christian worship causes bullying. you may as well make a case against fat kids and spots based on such logic.

None of these 'companies' have done a damn thing to help anyone but themselves, they've found a way to get £100 million or so in taxpayer's money, to 'solve' a problem that isn't there, and now they're laughing, just like the bankers and financial experts who fucked us all so hard in round 1, then left the poor to take the blame and the hate from the masses.

Here's my advice, I'm not charging a hundred pence, never mind a hundred million quid.  Maybe I should have, but at least I'm not the kinda of absolute waste of skin who thinks 'team building exercises' with sticky tape and toilet rolls' will help anyone find work.

1. Look in the local papers, it still works.
2. Keep an eye online, there's more to jobseeking than the godawful DWP site.
3. Volunteer - do as much as you can without offending your masters at the Jobcentre, it really can help!
4. Get your CV checked by someone with a clue.
5.  If you're going for a job you really want, don't forget to tailor your application to the vacancy - maybe you were retail, still involves problem solving, customer service, phone work, management skills, and so much more... Accentuate the relevant skills and downplay the other stuff.

6.

true,jfredett,tardis,TARDIS,"No worries. It tends to happen in smaller or less-conversation oriented subreddits more often because the voting base is actually smaller -- so even in a reddit like this one, which is twice the size of say, /r/skeptic (one of my subs), might have a voting base of about half the size.

You can determine this by looking at the three 'classes' of posts, and the total votes on them. In /r/skeptic, we don't have (generally) image posts, so to compare apples to apples, let's look at just link-posts (to articles) and self-posts.

The reason we need to break them into three pieces, you need to understand how voting works. The cost-to-upvote is entirely one of time. On average, the longer it takes to get a 'reaction' from a post, the less likely someone is to vote (positive or negative, typically in tune with their reaction) on that post.

So, especially with tools like RES, which let you view an image post directly in reddit, the cost-to-react is so small, that more people are likely to vote. Observing this reddit -- much of the content is in the form of images, so we cannot account the numbers of votes we see (like on this post, there are 2500 or so votes total), to the number of people _actually_ reading the post. Comments are most akin to self-posts, but typically a little better (because they're shorter, and therefore easier to digest). So the best estimate is somewhere between the voting mass of a self-post and a link-post. Looking at this subreddit, We can see that most link posts and self posts don't get much past 30-50 votes, so the voting mass for comments is likely quite low. Compare /r/skeptic, where links and self-posts routinely get in the hundreds of votes. (A recent link-post of mine there did 150 total, another self-post did about 400)

The reason these numbers matter is that it indicates the relative rate at which people vote, because of the fact that /r/doctorwho has a much smaller voting mass, then the probability of you getting upvotes drops -- unfortunately, reddit's own algorithm, as well as downvote bots, don't follow these same principles, so you ""see"" the effects more clearly in reddit like this, where the bots + reddit's own algorithm are not offset by enough people who upvote posts quickly enough. 

It's not even about having a good post. It's just number of people who 'spread out' over the comment list for a post. if there are 100 comments, all of them not terrible, but only 25 people voting on the post, it would require on average 4 votes per person, which is quite a lot.

So really, don't take it to hard when you get a few downvotes in /r/doctorwho or other small, low-mass reddits, it's just the nature of the mathematics in these little niches.",0,1361551360,null,0,false,0,c8js9xi,t3_18yyph,t1_c8js9xi,t1_c8jkuy8,null,1431373853,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,ibpants,1972crest,,"Firstly I think distinction needs to me made between international fans and domestic fans.  International fans have all kinds of weird and wonderful stories about how they settled on the team they support that you have to see them as separate entity.  It could be that they were unlucky enough to start following football at a time when United matches were the only ones shown in their country - it's not their fault.  Domestically there is a football team that represents your community wherever you are - it may not be a big team, but it's a team nonetheless.

Now, Manchester United are based in Trafford.  You'll hear all the arguments that their stadium is as close to Manchester city centre as City's, but it's all irrelevant to me.  As far as I'm concerned Manchester United DO NOT represent Manchester.  If I ever met a United fan from Trafford I'd have to say fair enough, but thus far I haven't.  Most of the United fans I've met are from places that have their own team, like Bury (Bury FC), Altrincham (Altrincham FC), Manchester (Manchester City FC).  Why do these people support United rather than the team that represents their community?  Could it have anything to do with United's success?

Let me go back to my little brother.  He comes from Manchester, lives right across the road from the Etihad, still lives with his family of City fans.  City represent his heritage, but who does he support?  United, and to be fair they are probably a better fit for his personality.  Now he can talk all he wants about history and community and whatever bullshit excuses he needs to make for himself because I grew up with him and I remember how he used to react to losing - the tears, the tantrums - he has always been a terrible loser (and not much better as a winner).  He is the only member of my immediate family that cheats at Monopoly - in fact, he cheats at everything to the extent that he has the nickname ""Tarzan's monkey"".

So, yes.  Aside from International United fans, and United fans from Trafford, I characterise them as being spoiled, unlikeable, obnoxious cheats.  The coin throwing incident I see as a (bad) reaction to Ferdinand's (very Manchester United) inability to win with grace - he had to goad the City fans because he's a twat.  Now, yeah I'd agree that throwing coins wasn't the most civilised response from the 
city fans, but the section he celebrated in front of is where the rowdier, die hard fans sit, so it doesn't surprise me that one of them decided to be a twat back.

This was the comment I made in our match thread on the coin throwing:

&gt; You can't justify throwing coins at Rio Ferdinand - anvils, grenades, hammers? Sure, but coins?

There's also this rather interesting clause in the JSA agreement stating you have to spend 2 hours each day looking for work. If they were to enforce that, it would likely see thousands of people cut off from benefits. I was even warned that I should be updating my online search every day to demonstrate my 2 hours otherwise I could be sanctioned, even though I had been to 3 interviews and applied for over 20 vacancies.

Paperwork and legislation very likely is going to smother the JSA system and it's going to get worse with the way things are looking.

I agree the walk-in is a waste of time though. I would rather they phoned me or gave me a time frame to phone them in.

Frankly though I'm sick of the sight of the jobcentre. I really want a job and I'm getting tired of applying for stuff. I've lately been getting feedback from interviews saying my interviews were fine but the candidate they went with had more recent experience; now I'm sorry but I'm out of work and I can't get more recent experience without volunteering, but even THAT is stupid.

According to the terms and conditions of 'volunteering' with JSA, this thing I have states that volunteering is not the same as 'turning down a wage' or 'doing a job that normally I would be paid for'. Apparently if I was to do that, they would deduct what I would normally earn for doing that role from my jobseekers, despite the fact I would not actually be paid.

I should state that I believe I got my current job by applying a few of these rules...

1. I saw the ad in the local paper.
3. I was volunteering, which meant I didn't have to have a 'current job' gap.
4. Where I was volunteering, a recruiter came once a week and offered her skills to people, and helped me shape up my CV to a professional standard.
5. I reworked all the talk of retail and IT stuff into call centre skills, phone manners, and customer service, downplaying any advanced computer skills or years spent behind a counter serving customers.

6. I did my time and made sure my agreement was full, giving me the time to concentrate on putting forward a quality application, as I feel the whole JSA pressure is all about quantity, not quality, and I could knock out 50 shitty applications a fortnight, and sadly some people have to, but ONE quality one would be better for actually getting hired.",0,1361553363,null,0,1361553630,0,c8jsy8k,t3_190thx,t1_c8jsy8k,t1_c8jr7k1,null,1431374170,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

He won't leave over summer unless Bayern liquidate some of their attacking options and Luis becomes a probable starter. The second part to this is, at the earliest, could leave in January if we're not well into the top 4 and playing at the top of our league. 

I think we've got one year left with Luis, with which we'll have to have some key summer acquisitions to prove to him that we're pushing to make our run to the top. If we only pick up a few above average players this summer, I think it sets the tone that we're on a slower pace to world greatness than Luis holds himself and we may lose him come January if we're not *walking the walk*.

Photosynthesis (which is understood fairly well) is not terribly efficient - in fact current photovoltaic solar cells are (many times) more efficient. Even [Solar Thermal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_thermal_energy) concentrators beat plants at getting energy from the Sun. So any method of sequestering CO2 through recapture by organic processes is going to be substantially less economic that simply using the sun to generate electricity.  
Getting rid of excess CO2 is always going to require energy, so it just seems to me like we should cut out the middle man and go straight to the Sun. This has the added advantage of leaving all the toxic heavy metals and radioactive material in coal buried with the carbon.

Arsenal fans say that Cazorla is not the kind of player who translates on to stats but I've seen enough football in my time to make out that Silva while not being translated onto stats as well is a much much better player than Cazorla. 

If you want the best of both good at stats and becoming the back bone of the team then Mata is better. If you want just a back bone to your team and don't necessarily need a player who leaves midfield to go score then you get Silva. Cazorla is in nowhere land, not good enough at neither than both of these guys and just overrated but that is what Arsenal fans do.

If we had any interest in him there would have been some rumors about a pre deal with us by now, but the only the only time we have been linked with him was when his agent said we were their first option. 

I don't know how I feel about Williams tbh. He's a good player, but he's not the most physically imposing CB and we already struggle with big CFs. He's also captain and just signed a new deal, so he definitely won't come cheap. I won't be upset if we sign him, but I would like to see us pursue other options before we attempt to sign him.

Can't really speak about the rest, I haven't watched them play, but it's clear that we're going to in for a CB in the summer and Skrtel and/or Coates are most likely leaving. I'd like to see us try and get Howedes, but that's never going to happen and he's most likely off to Bayern in the summer.

My biggest questions about this issue are - why isn't Dembele trying to play a larger role? His goal was magnificent yesterday, but he wasnt proactive in coming back to support when we had trouble moving the ball up; it was actually Holtby who would drop all the way back and effectively take the ball off Parker. My guess is that either AVB has told Moussa not to try and drop so deep to get the ball or that his hip injury is affecting him more than he's willing to let on.

I think it's the latter; he hasnt been the same player he was in the first part of the year since he went out injured.

Good. We can't pick parents for kids but we can stop parents damaging kids by leaving them with crap parents who've got no interest in raising them to be decent, well-rounded individuals.

true,RabidRaccoon,cnty-expat,Expat,"Makes you wonder if you need laws against slavery. The idea being that you'd define it legally and have an exemplary punishment. Ideally the death penalty, but life in prison without parole would work too.

The law has some vague stuff about 'living off immoral earnings' but it doesn't say ""if you rape and brand someone and treat them like a slave, we'll hang you/ship you off to spend life in prison where - not to put to put too fine a point on it - sexual slavery may well await you"".

I haven't seen Django yet but I suspect that the audience would have been a lot less happy if the slaveowner villain had been sentenced to ""x years in prison where we'll try to make sure they are treated well with the understanding they'd get out after x with good behaviour or less in the case of a successful appeal"" instead of dying horribly.

If we didn't have a state people like this would get lynched. It seems to me that if the state stops the lynching but doesn't substitute an appropriate alternate punishment (and ideally a lower false positive rate than mob justice), maybe we're better off without a state.

We could get rid of the state we have and replace it with one with a much more brutal system of punishments. I wouldn't go as far as mob rule but I'd definitely let juries decide on the punishment with the death penalty and things like birching available to them. There'd be a period of very high levels of executions as the crap is driven out of the system but it would probably settle down after a while to a society with low crime.

What about false convictions? Well jury trials are widely quoted as being 99% accurate. So of the executions 1% would be innocent. Still on the upside if the crime rate fell back to what it was in the 1950's we'd have a lot fewer victims. 

http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/rp99/rp99-056.pdf

Look at ""Table 1 : Offences intially recorded as homicide"", column 4. The rate has gone up from 7.3 per million in 1967 to 12.3 in 1997, i.e. 5 per million. In a population of 62 million that's 310 per year. I reckon my hypothetical hanging'n'flogging juries would kill a lot fewer innocent people than that. 

Plus of course teenage girls wouldn't get enslaved by scumbags. 

You could optimize it by give the juries a limited quota of hangings in the hope they'd use them carefully. E.g. in the case where a criminal had been sentenced to death the jury members would all vote on a ""kill priority"" from 1-10. You'd average those out to get the kill priority. Then the criminal would be sent to death row and death row would kill in order of decreasing kill priority but limited by a quota set by Parliament. If the quota run out the sentence would be commuted to life imprisonment.

Or you could say each jury can only kill n per month with n set by Parliament. The idea is that if they have to prioritise they're less likely to kill innocent people.",0,1361558298,null,0,1361561949,0,c8junum,t3_190xzd,t1_c8junum,t3_190xzd,null,1431374979,-7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-7

The next fortnight I went in to sign on, and she then told me she was disappointed that I hadn't applied for any cleaning jobs, ""there wasn't any"" I said truthfully. ""Not good enough,"" she said.

I think that what matters is that we're now all tied up together and in each others' back pockets, so that it becomes a matter of politics.

Any occasion on which one party needs the aircraft carriers we share, we're presumably going to need the other party to sign off on it. I presume there's going to be shared ongoing expenditures, so politicking will presumably dictate whether the contract gets awarded to a French or British supplier.

Certainly as long as the military actions can be framed as ""policing"" or ""peace-keeping"" actions, I think there's a lot of room for Sarkozy to be on the phone to Cameron, ""oh, come on, mon ami, you're gonna need us in the future, so it would be better for everyone if you sorted us out with a battalion of peace-keepers now"".

Since the strikers aren't scoring goals it seems like there is no collective positive movement when the team are building an attack. Before we got all these creative players, the Machine Chelsea had a very clear strategy of how they would dominate and get the ball to the striker. To me our current squad tries to get the ball to one of Oscar,Mata,Hazard,Cole? who then have to sort of make something out of it, and the rest of the team either push up in support or fall back when they inevitably lose possession. Once this fails to provide, the elected midfielder or in some cases defender hoofs the ball up top. Is this our strategy? I have no idea, but I miss mechanical Chelsea.

Now, she's 59 so will be retiring in less than a year, she has had a stroke, and a heart attack, and suffers from emphysema, so there is very little she can do. She has also worked all her life up until she had the stroke.

At her first appointment at the jobcentre she was asked if she had ever worked, and why wasn't she looking for a job.
She explained about her medical conditions, and that she was getting JSA until she qualifies for her state pension (she's not aware she should be claiming ESA, not that anyone at the benefits told her this).

She was told that wasn't good enough, and that regardless of her health she had to work.

Now I agree, under the Jobseeker's agreement she *should* be looking for work, but what pisses me off is the way they treated her as if she's some long-term scrounger, when I know she's not, and that the adviser didn't at any point pick up on the fact she cannot work, and so should be put on the appropriate benefit. (in this case ESA)

I think it's unfair to expect someone of both her age, and medical condition, to stack shelves for Tesco. She has been told if she doesn't get a job she will put on the work programme.

true,[deleted],null,null,"On the face of things a 3 man defence may be a good option to explore due to the decline of the 433 in the premier league. 352 works well tactically against 442 and 4231 and many teams in the league are playing one of these two formations nowadays.

There are a few issues I have with your proposal though.

1. Unfortunately I'd have to say that Ramires would be a better fit in your formation than Lampard. The right flank just looks too weak defensively and I think the energy of Ramires would be a better balance to the poise of Mikel and Oscar. For instance Juventus have had success using a DLP (Pirlo), a mostly offensive but conplete midfielder (Marchisio), and a ball-winner (Vidal). I personally believe they have the best 3 at the back team in the world and serve as a good example. I think Lampard/Oscar should be rotating for the Marchisio role.

2. Asmuch as this could be an effective setup I find it really really hard to leave out Hazard.

3. I don't think Moses possesses the end product to play ax a striker personally but thats only a minor concern.

Overall I think your proposal helps solve our midfield issue, and gives our attack more focus, so it addresses two major concerns. However, it does limit our attacking options a bit.

I would be interested in trying out the christmas tree that Ancelotti's Milan had so much success with. 4321. Standard back 4. Midfield consisting of a ball winner/runner, a Box to box, and DLP. (Ramires/Luiz, Lampard, Mikel/Luiz). Milan used Seedorf, Gattuso, and Pirlo. It also allows us to focus our attack centrally and employ two of Hazard, Oscar, Mata behind the striker. If we needed to change formation we can than use Moses, rather than having all of our attacking changes be like for like.

I 100% agree though that we need to be trying out some new things.

true,SpottieOttieDopalis,lfc68,,"It's not that he's better or worse when played a bit deeper or further forward, he just needs someone to play off of. He tried to do way too much during the Zenit game because he basically had no help. He was forced to try and create chances for himself and then finish them, on top of that. He needed someone else to take the load off of him, either a proper CAM or a forward in front of him.

That Zenit game we played a single pivot midfield, with Lucas as the holding mid and Gerrard and Allen as the 2 higher mids. Unfortunately Gerrard and Allen didn't do enough to support and link up with Suarez through the middle. That forced Suarez to drop deeper to receive the ball, into a space occupied by their DMs, and also caused their CBs to push forward, staying tight to him, which effectively clogged the space that Suarez usually works in. The same thing happens with Barcelona, but they have their wingers run in behind, into the space vacated by the CBs tracking Messi. Unfortunately Henderson and Downing both aren't going to do that, it's just not their strong suit. A proper CAM or ST could have supported Suarez, giving him an option to play off of, causing the opposition to pay less attention to Suarez and allow him to do what he does best.

Nothing wrong with that at all, but when you're sitting there at a locked-down college PC doing _exactly_ what you would do at home except less efficiently on an obfuscated system whilst listening to everyone else in the room gossiping about who fingerbanged whom, it gets a bit disheartening.

When we have Allen playing I think we are a lot better at it, his touch and ability to pass with either foot is fantastic. Enrique is also great as shielding the ball so he rarely gets dispossessed. 

Oddly Reina is a bit of a weak link and keeps hoofing it clear, which for a Spanish player from Catalan is something you would think he would excel at. Hopefully he can improve.

If the opposition do start closing you down at the back, then you have a legitimate reason to play a long ball, firstly because your under pressure, but secondly because you've pulled x number of players out of position and can bypass them with a ball over the top.

""Initially didn't see the left ankle get stepped on and so my thoughts were that if he ligitimatly wanted to stamp he would have done it a lot harder, HOWEVER, he does go to stamp him. More of a ""may as well"" than a ""And now we stamp"" kind of thing.

Then I noticed the left ankle and I don't care what you say that one is accidental. By the time he is looking down his foot is pretty much already on the ankle, I see no malice in the left ankle step. With this is account I didn't change my stomp on the back.... then I watch a slower gif of it.

OK, here is where the down-votes come from. I want to point out how the right leg of Suarez leaves the ankle of the player. I am unsure but I don't think that is a ""I have stamped on you"" movement, it would be more fluid than that if it was. I think it is a ""oh, I stepped on you there"" kind of movement. Having stepped on someones ankle before (by accident) I can say that you try to get off them as quickly as you can. Notice how quickly Suarez tries to pull up his right leg, he wants that leg to move, but because his left is still in the air, it is more difficult. What you have to do is almost make your leg (right in this case) lift by swinging it outwards, but since you can't your left leg goes wide to compensate.

Try running onto something with one foot then, whilst still running, try to move your standing leg (the one that hit the object) without letting the other touch the ground and notice where it is easiest for that other leg to go. I think that to do it your other leg must go wide.

Lastly, because I just noticed it, look at Suarez body in general. The guy is jumping. His body straightens, his arms go up to get elevation and the final flick with his left foot all tell me now that the stomp on the back was accidental as well.

Yes I did start to change my opinion whilst I was writing this but I am convinced the ankle stop was completely unintentional and due to that he is jumping off to, well, get off the ankle quicker, and that movement then causes the back stomp (which I can say might have something in it, but not much if anything. These two did have a bit of a battle throughout the game so......Not to mention no apology was made).""

I'v spoken to my girlfriend about this and she completely agrees with Flamekebab. She says that the confusion arises because my tone of voice doesn't change. If you actually thought about what i was saying youd realise it was sarcasm, but because the prompts in my voice aren't there people dont understand. Now dont get me wrong, when I do put a sarcastic tone into my voice people pick up on it straight away.

Napoleon made more progress, faster:

Start of Barbarossa to the Battle of Moscow - 22nd June to 22nd October

Start of Russian Campaign to the occupation of Moscow - 24th June to 2nd September

&gt;  tactical genius of Hitler

That's a very bad choice of words. Hitler was notorious for disrupting the affairs of his generals, disrupting their plans and making very dubious decisions. It was the genius of men like Guderian, Manstein, Rundstedt, definitely not of Hitler.

&gt; If it wasn't for the failure of their supply chain and the war on the other front, Hitler would have had Stalin's genitalia for breakfast on Christmas Morning, 1941

Yes, I suppose if they didn't fail to keep their troops properly supplied, by far the most important thing for any nation commanding any force in any part of the world they would have done a darn sight better. But they did fail in the most fundamental principles of strategy - logistics. The majority of the German supply was still  horse and cart, their supply lines were always going to fail until that problem was resolved (which Germany couldn't do).

&gt; The Russian Army was under-supplied, out of date, idiotic and had only one advantage to speak of, shier body count.

That 'only advantage to speak of' is a huge advantage that helped them win the war, you're trivialising a huge war asset as if it's nothing, Germany seriously underestimated Russian manpower and suffered for it. Even if Germany had managed to take Moscow, that does not mean they would have won the war - Napoleon made that mistake. Hitler had to be able to defend Moscow once he'd taken it, and with a large portion of Russian industry moved behind the Urals in preparation for Germany reaching Moscow it's highly likely they would have continued the fight. 

As for superior German technology, German doctrinal superiority was far more important. The Soviets had a 4:1 advantage in tanks against Germany, but they did not know how to use them effectively which nullified their huge advantage over Germany. Their army was also poorly organised, being spread across the entire Russo-German border which allowed Germany to concentrate its forces and destroy the Russian army piecemeal, rather than having to fight it head on. This allowed Germany to march to Moscow relatively unheeded, it was only when Russia was allowed to regroup after being taken by surprise that they were able to stabilise the front and begin pushing Germany back. The Russian T-34 was by far better than anything the Germans were fielding at the start of Barbarossa, though they were yet to be the majority-Soviet tank on the battlefield. In terms of aircraft you're right, the Soviet airforce was obsolete. Artillery wise the Russians lead the way with thing like the Katyusha. In terms of small arms the Russians were quite superior, things like the PPSh  outmatched anything the Germans were fielding (MP-40) by a large margin, and the Mosin-Garant was on par with the K98. 

The Russian Army at the start of the war did have poor leadership, that's true thanks to Stalin's interference and the 1936 purges. This was not true after the first year or so however. Men like Rokossovsky, Zhukov, Timoshenko, Konev, and Vasilevsky could most definitely not be described as 'idiots'.

You also had the failings of Stalin himself, who refused to believe his intelligence that a German invasion was incoming. That's why the majority of his airforce was destroyed before it even got into the air, and why the Soviet army was still on border duty spread thinly across the entire border.

true,birdandbear,tennant,Tennant,"I'd say start with New Who and then go back if you're interested. As to which episodes, I think it depends on whether you prefer more of a sci-fi vibe or more lyricism in storytelling. 

More sci-fi vibey:

* *Dalek* - Ninth Doctor
* *The Impossible Planet/The Satan Pit*  - Tenth Doctor
* *Midnight* - Tenth Doctor (This one's actually closer to horror, but it seems to fit in with these others and it's an *extremely* good episode.)
* *42* - Tenth Doctor
* *Flesh and Stone* - Eleventh Doctor
* *The Rebel Flesh/The Almost People* - Eleventh Doctor 


More emotionally focused:

* *Father's Day* - Ninth Doctor
* *The Girl in the Fireplace* - Tenth Doctor
* *Human Nature/The Family of Blood* - Tenth Doctor
* *Vincent and the Doctor* - Eleventh Doctor
* *The Girl Who Waited* - Eleventh Doctor


Most episodes of course comprise elements of both styles, including the ones listed above. Some of the very best are too hard to quantify in either direction, including *The Doctor's Wife*, *The Doctor's Daughter*, *Blink*, and *Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead.*

All of these should work as a good introduction, without needing too much context. I'd say of the ones I've listed, *Midnight*, *The Girl in the Fireplace*, *Blink*, and *Vincent and the Doctor* make the best true stand alones.

And to me, whichever Doctor I'm currently watching is the best, although I do have a special love for Ten's ebullience. ;)

Incidentally, would love a thread with your favourite cheesy football songs. Here are my two (ignoring the genius of Ossies Dream and the horror of the Anfield Rap):
