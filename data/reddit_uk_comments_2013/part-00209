Secondly, the BBC always leans towards the party in power in terms of coverage, and recent figures suggest this tendency has strengthened under the Tories if anything - although this doesn't tell you much about the _nature_ of that coverage (pro or anti).  Third, there are plenty of Tory apparatchiks towards the top of the BBC hierarchy, so, unless they're over-compensating, this seems a bizarre claim.  Finally, party political bias is only one very small part of the question of whether the Beeb is biased.  It's is really mostly the news coverage which is being discussed, and there are questions as to whether the rest of the programming contains assumptions, norms, representations of British life etc. which diverge from most people's reality.  It's entertainment, not a mirror, of course, but to the extent it is a mirror, it's a valid question to ask how distorting it is - how does it represent wealth, class, lifestyles, north versus south, attitudes, and so on.  And, back to the news, to what extent is there an establishment, or status quo preference in presenting the stories of the day?  Our three main parties, and particularly their leaderships, the senior civil servants, the security services, the large corporate executives, the wealthy, the Oxbridge alumni, the senior military and police, the professional classes, etc., share more of a worldview with each other than they do with the rest of us, and arguably, the BBC reflects this in how it reports the news.",0,1381025339,null,0,false,0,cclvh9z,t3_1nt2fi,t1_cclvh9z,t3_1nt2fi,null,1429231271,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,justnono,null,null,"&gt; Surely more capacity in the road network will by itself improve buses and to some degree bike riders?

Bigger roads dont make cycling any safer. Also if the increase (as it is claimed in the UK) is to deal with existing demand will it lead to quicker bus journeys as by the time its finished demand will have out stripped the increase. 

&gt; Besides which hasn't an argument for a long time been that there is no place to put a cycle/bus lane in because of lack of capacity and the need for all lanes to be car capable? More lanes would give campaigners of such things more leverage to get them installed at a later date.

Part of the problem is that there is space now but people are not willing to give it up. What will happen is this space will be come the normal and people will not be willing to give this up. 
 
&gt; Is it perfect? No, not really but it does give you more wiggle room when playing the long game. 

I would say look to the US vs the Netherlands. You kind of have to make a choice at some point about the direction you want to go. NL was in a similar place to the UK in the 60s and when with livable cities, walking, public transport and cycling (though driving is still popular and provided for on longer journeys) . The US went the other way introduced Jaywalking laws , requirements for slower vehicles to stay right ( left for us in the UK) on many roads and endless road widening programs. You can kind of see the issues this causes in cities like LA where traffic grows to fill the roads provided (as other methods of transport suffer from under investment).

So I get where you are coming from but the reality is this is not the first road widening program in the UK and it (most likely) wont be the last. Demand for cycle infrastructure is not new and 'there is not enough space' has always been an argument against it. 

Don't get me wrong I am not blanket against road widening I just wont help buses and bikes in any real way.

* Seen by many to be undemocratic. People in Britain are able to vote on MEPs but there exists a lack of understanding of what MEPs do and many feel they do not weild enough power to defent British interests

* There was never a point where the UK voted to be a member. It's percieved by many to be elites pushing the UK into an organisation without consent. The issue would most likely be different if Britain had been given a say on membership at somepoint 

* It does cost money, some of which in inevitable lost in bureaucracy and EU running costs

* The UK is a net contributor. It does not recieve back (in terms of money) what it puts in

* The EU has power to enforce certain laws on the UK (The EU dosn't actually pass laws, it passes directives which strongarm members to pass laws conforming to the directive). Many see this as an attack on sovereignty 

* Membership of the EU means freedom of labour movement between member states. Since the organisation has expanded into Eastern Europe this has increased the level of immigration to the UK. To those who think this is wrong, it's made even worse when politicians tell them ""there is nothing we can do, we're in the EU"". Should also be noted the EU will most likely expand to contain other countries that will bring more immigrants to the UK

* The EU retains powers over certain issues. Most notably trade. Britain cannot organise its own trade treaties with other countries or opt out of ones it is already in.

* The EU can be seen as poorly managed at times. Especially with projects like the Euro having such poor results.

This figure has been debunked loads of times on here, because it used to be a fav rallying cry of /u/FakePlasticShrimp (now returned as the apolitical /u/GOT_A_SPARE_QUID_M8 for anyone who was missing him). 

It's a figure that kippers *keep* saying, because it supports their narrative, and even when it's proven wrong they keep ignoring it.

The top two hits of [this google search](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=50m+per+day+ukip) suggest that UKIP started shouting this figure in 2009, and those articles are pretty clear that the £50m figure is only our contribution, and doesn't account for our receipts - what the EU gives back to us.

[This rebuttal from 2009 is based on UKIP's previous figure of £40m per day, and seems quite comprehensive.](http://www.jcm.org.uk/blog/2009/05/ukips-britain-paying-the-eu-40-million-a-day-claim-vs-the-real-costs-of-uk-eu-membership/) ",0,1381033632,null,0,false,0,cclxtmj,t3_1nt6h8,t1_cclxtmj,t1_cclsvp7,null,1429230178,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

The show needed to step it up for season 3 and the show didn't do that for me as it was just the same old shit, with no consequences for their actions.

Have Simon maybe become really bitter and angry after years of being picked on and pushed around. Have superpowers play more of a role and perhaps show what the general public think of them? The show needed a proper antagonist for them to fight against? Maybe rather than swapping powers, which i left was really cheep, have them work to evolve them and become more powerful? 

Also, What happened to the detective trying to find out what happened to the first and second care workers? Does he ever find out?

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"&gt; pinch of salt and all that

Not holding *your* feet to the fire on this because your just quoting tham but I should point out the inaccuracies and misconceptions about the numbers UKIP quotes. We contribute just over 11 billion to the EU budget (which is over 7 times smaller than our own governments budget) which does work out at around 30 million a day. Still a 66% jump to 50 million a day but OK that's gross contribution. After you deduct the money we receive back from the EU and the money we get in the rebate our net contribution is [6.27 billion.](http://www.euromove.org.uk/index.php?id=15079). That works out at a little over 17 million a day. To put this into perspective education alone costs us [242 million a day](http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/), 14 times more, and education is not the largest part of our budget by any means. Any who some people would say that 6.27 billion is still too much. They make the point that this is 6.27 billion above and beyond what we get back from the EU which is true. We see none of that 6 billion. 

However this is kind of the point of the EU and we knew that when signing up. There are nations who contribute more than they receive and nations who receive more. Being a rich country we are among the contributors. That money goes to other countries to aid aid EU funded projects such as agriculture/environmental projects, grants to students who want to study abroad, scientific research and infrastructure building in places that need it. I know this comparison might make UKIP hate it more but think of it like progressive taxes. The rich pay more to fund programs to help those who need it and hopefully make us all a little bit more equal. But that 6.27 billion also buys us access to the common market within the EU. The EU has been working for decades to make sure that when people do business that the rules are common for all countries to make it easier. Hence the metric system and laws on consumer protection that the EU pushes. The boost in business caused by the fact that it's so easy to offer goods and services in other EU countries is very hard to quantify. UKIP estimates that extra legislation has made it harder to do business which is flatly contradicted by the opinions of [77% of small and medium sized business owners](http://www.cbi.org.uk/media-centre/press-releases/2013/09/8-out-of-10-firms-say-uk-must-stay-in-eu-cbi-yougov-survey/). 

Furthermore we also get free access to move, live and work anywhere in Europe. If you want to move to Austria and start a business selling...Austrian things then you can but it costs us 6.27 billion a year - about £100 per person per year on average adjusted for tax bracket - low incomes pay less high incomes pay more, average is £99-100ish. Personally I would pay 100 quid a year to be allowed to live and work anywhere in the EU and I happily pay it now but it depends if you think its worth the money. 

Also, a quick point on 'undemocratic evil EU bureaucrats' - the EU parliament is elected by citizens of Europe and the members of the council are also domestic politicians so are elected. The only unelected people are commissioners. However there is one commissioner per member state and that commissioner is nominated by elected politicians. For instance the current vice-president of the Commission is a Brit and she was nominated by Tony Blair. The commission might be the an area that would need reforming but even so it's representative of UK politicians if not the people. If more people actually turned up to vote in European elections then maybe people would feel more represented in Europe than they do now. There's no point shouting 'I didn't vote for you' when you didn't vote at all. European elections will be held between 22 and 25 May 2014. Go and vote!

I lived the first 16 years of my life in a council estate, left home at 16 got a job in a warehouse at the docks unloading and loading vans and rented a cheap flat in Northfield (a scheme in my city) I'm as working class as you get and I know what I'm talking about when it comes to what working class people think more than most. 

Don't you think it's a bit condescending and arrogant to think people are only against multiculturalism and immigration because they're fed propaganda? Even if you disagree with the views surely you must at least aknowledge that there are serious arguments on both sides. I don't believe in full blown multiculturalism because some cultures are inherently different in their beliefs and values. Purposely putting poor people who are completely at odds with each other and cramming them into shitty estates is sick. Does that make me or anyone else racist for thinking that? I'm against Islam in the form that many muslims around the world choose to follow it for the same reason I'm against Christian, homophobic, racist nutcases that you find so often in the USA. I wouldn't want either group coming to the UK or Europe in large numbers but in Islam's case it's happening and it's only causing tension and violence. It's nothing to do with skin colour or race (theories discounted by science decades ago, despite what the BNP think) it's about what you believe and how you think.

As for how working class in anti-fas groups you're most likely in a better position than me to know but from personal expierience the only people I ever met who would even sympathise with the idea of groups like the UAF were middle class students at college (and I am a social person).

Well, if our system doesn't suit decent strikers, then we either have to change it so it does, or change formation, because this ridiculous outlook that strikers don't fit our ""system"" is a joke.

Sturridge didn't work for us, he went to Liverpool, they saw the potential with him, partnered him with Suarez, and now they potentially will become one of the greatest partnerships in the BPL.

There is no reason we couldn't do the same with Lukaku and Eto, or Lukaku and Ba - We seem to have our midfielders at the top, and as far as I'm concerned, strikers are and will always be the most important part of any team.

Look at the top teams around the world, their most important players.

- Barcelona: Messi
- Real: Ronaldo
- Man United: RVP 
- Man City: All of their strikers
- PSG: Ibra or Cavani
- Monaco; Falcao or Riviere
- Dortmund: Lewandowski

""I saw the birth of the universe and watched as time ran out, moment by moment, until nothing remained. No time, no space. Just me! I walked in universes where the laws of physics were devised by the mind of a madman! And I watched universes freeze and creation burn! I have seen things you wouldn't believe! I have lost things you will never understand! And I know things, secrets that must never be told, knowledge that must never be spoken!""

The universe will always be there, because if he dies then there too dies the last of the time lords. There too dies the only one that can change the universe as the Doctor has seen it, because he's seen both the beginning and the end, and all he does in his time is fiddle with the middle. He's confident, assured in every adventure he's ever been on that no matter if his life ends today, 3000 years ago or with all matter at the end, nothing will change the hundreds of happy endings that he has seen. Nothing has the power to anymore. 

That's why I can't accept the end of time.

With friends like us, he’s never going to die, is he?"" Because the doctor will never be forgotten, he will never die.

No, he is better than them because he has been better than them, and has stats to back that up. The team of the week award is just nice third party confirmation.

&gt;Sakho makes mistakes that better teams will punish.

He hasn't made a mistake yet, which is the whole point.

&gt;He does tend to lose possesion

Sakho has the second highest pass completion rate on our entire team, 89%. Kolo? 81%. Skrtel is at 91%, but has far more passes to Mignolet than Sakho.

&gt;it doesn't look like he communicates well with the other defenders.

That's out of thin air.

I don't think it's condescending nor arrogant to point out that one of the largest causes of hostility to immigration, immigrants and multiculturalism is the misrepresentation of these issues in the media. Many people will have their own experiences and situations which may make them receptive, but the distorting lens generalises these and heightens the climate of fear and ""otherness"".  I also don't think that all those who critique multiculturalism are necessarily racists, criticism comes from across the political spectrum after all, but I do think much criticism is predicted on racism, (fear of) loss of White privilege and misunderstanding what the debate is even about.

Another huge positive are the online shops, prices are much cheaper than on the continent since competition is much higher. Games, electronics, services, houseware, clothes, you name it and it'll go on offer for -cheap-. Cashback deals on anything from gas/electric, hotels, shopping etc can earn you quite a bit for doing absolutely nothing.

Mobile phone contracts are really cheap here, as well TV (freeview!) and broadband.

Going out to eat is affordable. There's plenty of fine-to-great restaurants you can eat at for under £15 a head. Alcohol gets sold in pints, no more getting ripped off on miniscule glasses of beer / cider / whatever.

The NHS. Back in NL you have to pay €100+ a month for healthcare insurance, regardless of your income or job status. After some tax breaks that's still €60+ for even students. The quality of the two systems is about the same, so NI contributions based on income are way fairer on lower incomes.

The countryside is really pretty. Love those tiny old villages set in a hilly landscape.

People are more polite, if you almost bump into someone there will be ""sorry""s all around, instead of a mean look.

I used to have exactly the same attitude to you until I got burgled. It fucked me up for a good month or two.

I am not a financial advisor, so I can only comment on our mortgage. We can over pay up to £500 pcm, if we pay £501 in a single calender month then we are charged an early repayment fee.

So, we overpay the maximum (&amp; no more) every month &amp; put the rest in a savings account. Once our fixed rate term ends, we will be allowed to pay it all off without an early repayment fee, so we are saving up to clear it completely when that happens.

Interestingly, we get a letter every month when we overpay the maximum &amp; the first time we overpaid at all they sent us a letter asking if we wanted to reduce our future monthly payments over the remaining term or if we just wanted them to take it off the actual loan &amp; continue repaying at the same rate (which is what we opted for).

For the record, we are not super rich, we have a little house &amp; this is our second fixed rate term (we renewed last time it expired) &amp; we haver lived here for over 10 years so our mortgage was not huge to start with.

The thing that we enjoy most, is seeing how much interest we have saved.

When it comes to news sources we are influenced by 3 main things.

[Selective Exposure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_exposure_theory) - We generally expose ourselves to news sources that we agree with and confirm our world view.  So I read the Guardian rather than the Sun or Daily Mail for example.


[Selective Retention](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_retention) - We only remember and process things that again are underpinned by our own values and belief systems.


[Selective Perception](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_perception) This is where people interpret media messages in the way that again fits their already existing viewpoints.


To look at the media and blame it for causing the issues claim is looking at it at the slightly wrong angle.  Newspaper media in particular has evolved to serve the cross section of the population it is selling adverts for.  Make no mistake the primary function of a paper is to be profitable (one or two notable exceptions such as the Guardian which is owned by a trust).  To do this it understands its readership and targets its content towards it.  i.e. the content in the Financial Times is geared towards a demographic that advertisers will pay a premium to reach.  Newspaper Editors are fully aware of the psychology behind reader behaviour and are therefore highly unlikely to print anything that would stand against their readerships core belief systems.

true,juu4,eu,Latvia,"Worst - Housing. Very expensive for what you get, and not very high quality (lots of rental properties are abysmal, and in general most houses are sieves which lose a lot of heat in winter, leading to high heating bills).

Second worst - the prices of a lot of stuff seem really high, although the shock wears off over time.

Third worst - the taxes. I think they are quite high.

Fourth worst - Traffic jams. But it really depends on where and when you go. That being said, I'm afraid of actually going anywhere for the bank holiday weekend, as the chances of spending most of it moving at 5 mph along one of the motorways are high.

Fifth worst - the weather. Too much rain, too little sun.


The best - the people. At least were I live, most people are nice and polite. On average, people seem to be way more sane than many of the Americans that I experienced while living in USA, and way friendlier and trustworthy than the people in other places which I've visited quite a bit.

Second best - everyone speaks English.

Third best - the National Trust. So many nice places to visit with the family for reasonable yearly fee.

News of the Screws was a terrible rag, but for instance some of the claims that the Guardian made against it haven't had enough evidence come out to back them up.  Namely the deletion of Milly Doweler voicemail messages.  That bit of information really did shift the public from outrage to furious outrage.

The Guardian also do target individuals, just not *your* kind of person, their coverage of financial matters is incredibly ignorant, even to someone who's only done a basic IMC.  For instance [this](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/mar/02/sir-fred-goodwin-royalbankofscotlandgroup) to some might seem justified, to others, its trail in a court of public opinion, which isn't a society I want to live in.  The difference is when is a person of public interest.  The DM has different criteria to you, but evidently the person is of public interest, as people read it.

You get poor people like Chris Jefferies, but why single out the DM?  The Mirror and the Sun were also pretty horrid to him.  For his trouble he apparently got 6 figures, with £50k coming from the Mirror alone.   However I can't imagine how hard it would have been to life his life with a sudden abrupt change of people being told you're a murdering rapist.  Notice how the papers who didn't do such a thing (ie Times, Torygraph, Guardian) all did a similar bit by reporting on the others reporting of it.

Also the Guardian have chronic hypocrisy, attacking companies, promoting direct action (something I don't see the Mail doing, but then I don't read it, so the DM might just be *less efficient* at it).  Arranging some sit in protests at vodafone or similar is really quite damaging, regardless of the size of the company in question.  When they themselves have all sorts of tax fiddles.

The EU is moving towards federalism.  For 25 years the UK has been trying to reform the EU, it can speed it up, or it can slow it down, but reform has only ever been in one direction, the alternative to that is EFTA, a free trade agreement.  That's the argument going forward; Federalism and much more of the same or opting for a free trade agreement instead.

- Being a member of EFTA would mean that when trading with the EU  we the UK would have to meet EU regulations much as we have to meet US regs when dealing with the US or Chinese regulations when dealing with China.  The rest of the *economy* (not exports), around 90%, would not come under this extra regulation which costs the economy.

- We would have an EFTA court like Switzerland, which means not being under a foreign judge who does understand UK law, but be allowed to appoint our own judges to the EFTA court.

- We would regain control of our fishing stocks from the common fisheries policy which is being woefully mismanaged.

- We would regain control from the common agricultural policy and tailor subsidies to UK needs

- We would regain a seat on the World Trade Organisation 

- We could negotiate our own trade deals with the rest of the world without having to go through an inflexible trade commissioner who cannot, and is prohibited from tailoring deals for the UK.

- We could drop EU tariffs with the rest of the world.  The EU actually acts as a custom's union and is very protectionist.  Without even negotiating trade deals with the rest of the world we could drop tariffs by several percent and immediately become more competitive.

- Dropping tariffs would also allow developing countries to develop their agrarian sectors rather than their farmers being priced out.  Less subsidies, less need for foreign aid (0.7% of GDP), cheaper food and lower living costs, more trade.

- We could immediately drop the European Arrest Warrant.  The problem with the EAW is that it assumes all police, judicial, jail and remand services are the same across Europe.  They are not.  As such we now have cases where people have been taken from the UK and held in foreign countries, under pretty grim conditions, on evidence that would never have been considered in the UK and which is thrown out as soon as it gets to court, but because they're from the UK they've had to face months, even years, in a jail cell waiting for their case to be heard.  It is a terrible system.  We could still have extradition treaties but where evidence is presented in the UK first before anybody is handed over.

- We can have affordable, clean energy or we can have renewable targets.  We could scrap the EU's 20-20-20 energy policy and reduce energy bills by 10% overnight.  By removing renewable targets we could then lower electricity bills further for everybody, domestic and commercial, by investing in nuclear and gas.

- We could have control over our own foreign policy, and not have an unelected foreign affairs commissioner who represents 28 members with often conflicting opinions, speaking for us at cross purposes.

- We could have our own Bill of Rights that is not superceded by either the ECJ or the ECHR.   The ECHR was not written within the EU but it has been given recognition by the ECJ which has taken its findings as their own.  The European Charter of Human Rights is a terribly weak document in that the very rights it claims to recognise it allows to be removed in a state of emergency or in certain scenarios - precisely when you need your rights recognised, in other words. 

- Outside the EU we would still be able to retain all EU trade negotiated using Article 50

- EFTA countries have a veto on EU regulations that would apply to them.

- The UK would be able to put controls on net immigration allowing people in on work visas to fulfill roles that our own domestic labour force cannot meet, but limit people coming in for roles which it can.

- We could repeal the EU postal directives which would allow the Post Office and Royal Mail to return to a natural, profit making state owned entity. 

- We could regain our sovereignty

- We could improve our democracy, because there's certainly a democratic deficit and lack of accountability in the EU, and a larger, further away government is harder to manage, track and petition.  We need to distance ourselves from a system that blatantly ignored countries rejecting a constitution that only went on to push concepts regardless through a treaty instead.  A treaty which they ignored referendums.

- Once we have devolved power from Brussels we could continue to devolve power to local areas and regions.  The EU is about handing power up.

- Leading EU Federalists such as the Spinelli Group are calling for a post-national Europe.  Literally doing away with the concept of nation states in Europe.  It goes without saying they've not asked anybody about this but they're still working towards it.  This is called Balkanisation and it leads to war.  NATO has brought peace to the Europe not the EU.  The EU has argued for war.  We could still be a member of NATO with a free trade agreement outside the EU.

- We could drop out of the European Working Hours Directive, which  whilst launched with the best of intentions, is ravaging the NHS - especially the level of training.

- We could go through passed EU regulations with a red pen and cut out bureaucracy.

- We could lower our spending on bureaucracy, whilst as a net contributor identifying good legislation or wise spending and maintain it and still save money.

We can't do these things within the EU.  Reform has only ever moved in one direction and they're creating a Frankenstein monster in Federalism.  For an absolute fraction of the cost we can do all of the above things by simply working with Europe through E.F.T.A., the European Free Trade Association which the UK has already signed.

Best things; 

* The NHS (I know it has faults but whenever I've needed it it's been there and been free)

* The BBC &amp; C4 (seriously, travel anywhere and watch TV - British television is fantastic... Apart from ITV. ITV's rubbish)

* The countryside (I live in Orkney now, but across the UK the landscape, the countryside is incredible)

* The student loan system (I know debt sucks, but it's actually not that bad - you only pay back when you're earning and it's starting to make people think about whether they should be going to university. Plus, have you seen the US system???  $100k&gt; debts that you need to pay every month regardless of income).

Worst things: 

* The climate (never too cold, never too hot, just unending grey skies and a thousand kinds of rain.  I long for proper seasons)

* Secondary education system (sure it's great compared to countries without one, but compared to Europe and even the US the secondary education system is broken. We channel kids into life defining choices before they're even 16, we conveyor belt them to university whether it's right for them or not, and yet there's a horrendous number of young adults coming out of secondary education without basic literacy and numeracy skills).

* Politics - we get a choice of three shades of grey, our politics have drifted so far into the middle that the three major parties are becoming barely indistinguishable. Parties lead by young white men from privileged Oxbridge backgrounds, with personal convictions that vanish at the first sight of election victory.

* And last but not least - the people.

There's no possible way I'm going to trust the BBC to choose what's right and not right. In theory, I can see the argument, but in practice there are issues with it. There's many instances when they publish something that is a spoiler. The IDW comics before the 50th are a good example. Another one is posting the full cast list for Bells of Saint John before airing, therefore spoiling the surprise of the client at the end, something which got a fair few of the big fansites' panties into a twist and with good reason where the BBC had to revoke it.

And it's not just for the TV show as the publicity for Destiny of the Doctor #5 can be another example. When you center a good proportion of the story around NOT knowing who the enemy is, it's not a good idea to simply blurt out the name in the PR segments without warning.

http://www.thefreedictionary.com/socialism

Nearly all the definitions here involve ""real"" socialism, especially the establishing of the people owning the means of production. You can argue over when all the main British political parties were no longer socialist but an easier time to point out is the end of the Attlee government, who were socialist by nearly all definitions except that of the most extreme radical socialists.

For example I'd say for a government to be socialist they need to at least have several nationalised industries; trains, energy, postal service are the most common (and in my opinion sensible) options for a state to take over. 

I know you said you aren't using dictionary definitions but I don't follow. When using a term like socialism to describe something isn't it important to use that term in the correct way so as to convey your meaning as clearly as possible to a wide range of people?

Socialism definitely means something different in Europe to how many people in the US use it. Typically people in the US argue your point and then add on ""so it's like communism light, which is kind of like Stalinism, which was bad, ergo. European political and economic systems are inferior to the US"". Hopefully I don't sound to pedantic, I'm genuinely interested in your point because I havn't heard people argue your point of view before, at least not a European.

Pros

+ According to [Times Higher Education University Rankings](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2013-14/world-ranking), Sheffield ranks above the other two by a good few places.

+ Award winning Student Union. The best in the UK 2 years running I believe.

+ The city is really safe. The crime rate is one of the lowest in the UK I believe.

+ The University is doing an exchange student integration project alongside a lot of societies so you'll make friends fast.

+ Sheffield is rather pretty, 61% of the city is green space and it has the highest ratio of trees to people in Europe.

+ Goodwin Sports Centre recently got redone and there is a fantastic range of sports and loads of opportunities to get involved with varsity sports and walloping the rival University, Sheffield Hallam.

+ Nightlife is decent, we have loads of pubs and bars on Broomhill, where most students live and the Endcliffe village (University owned accommodation) is near. If you're more of a noisy club and dancing guy unlike myself, I constantly hear good things about West Street's clubs. The Tiger Lounge do a weekly Drum and Bass thing as well.

Cons

- Everything is a bit spread out, if you end up in the main student village, it's a good half hours walk to the Arts Tower and the Hicks Building where I study. Although I believe Law is in a slightly closer building.

- Public transport is overpriced. £0.80 each way to get the bus into Uni. If you want to visit city centre and not walk an hour each way? £4 return on the tram.

- Sheffield is a bit out of the way, you'll want to visit other places in the UK I assume and go sightseeing. There are loads of buses and trains to other cities but you almost always have to change at Manchester.

* Cynicism, sarcasm. It really hurts after a while. Especially for us can-do sorts. 

* Judgement- it seems the British are always judging other people as rude, etc when really people are just being themselves and they have different personalities. I asked you to pass the salt not save a country, a thanks isn't warranted. I feel like polite words lose their value here.

* Ridiculously low wages

* A general lack of demand for quality amongst housing, products, food, consumables. It feels like the products here are 10 years behind. 

* Service- generally slow, lacking a human touch and isn't high quality

* Many cities lacking a discernable area of employment outside of retail, fast food, etc.

* Parks

* Intellectual culture

It's extremely good feels to be looking at the top of the league this season compared to trying to avoid looking at the table and telling yourself that results doesn't matter..

That being said of course we can do better. It'll definitely be interesting to see when everybody is fit and raring to go, do we stick to the 3 at the back and whether our transfer policy will indicate that.

On no, don't get me wrong, I am definitely doing this for my future, but I just don't see the point in currently worrying about my finances in 20 years time when there is very little I can do to change that. I'd rather get my finances in check now and not have to suffer for that in the long run if I can. 

&gt;I cant believe how the government think its ok to tax the young for education (which is effectively what they are doing), but if young people put up with it under a cloud of naiveity they will continue to do it.

Unfortunately, that very same government have made it incredibly difficult to not end up in higher education. Every job I've applied for has either asked for previous experience or a degree. As I'm unable to get the job, I have no experience, and therefore need a degree. I can only name 1 person out of the hundreds I've been in education with who hasn't gone on to university, and they're currently sat at home with their parents with no job and next to no job prospects. It sucks. 

&gt;your generation have been absolutely screwed by my generation, in almost every way (seriously)

And yet Time magazine and other forms of media refer to my generation as being selfish, lazy, narcissistic slobs who are ruining this country's social morals and traditions. It's no wonder a lot of younger people are left feeling depressed and with mental health issues when this is the lot we've been given. The world sucks at the moment, and there's very little we can do about it. 

I appreciate your input though - as much as people consistently tell me that ""Ohhhh you're doing law you should be able to get a job"" and I tell them that actually, no, that's not looking likely, it's good to find someone who is down to earth and actually realises what a shitty deal we've been given.

We don't enforce that rule.  It is polite to warn people if you're going to spoil something, but not obligatory.  Personally, I actually think it's more important to put a spoiler warning on a 30-40 year old episode than one that aired from season 6 or 7 since it's much more likely that someone browsing this sub wouldn't have seen the older one.

&gt;It could also be said to be selfish to expect other people to walk on eggshells to protect people from things that it is their responsibility to protect themselves from.

How on earth is that selfish?  By allowing spoilers in headlines, we'd be locking out an entire audience of people from this subreddit.  Making this subreddit inaccessible for a lot of people to browse just because some people don't want to spend the two seconds it takes to click a link to see if they're interested is far more selfish in my eyes.

true,monkfishbandana,cnty-wales,Cymru,"Megabus is a private coach company that specialise in insanely cheap deals for travel within the UK (and they've starting doing a few trips to Europe as well). It is fantastic, but here's the best way I can break it down:

I've just done a search for Cardiff to London and Cardiff to Glasgow, both leaving on Monday and coming back on Friday.

**PROS:**

* Insanely cheap: Cardiff-London return is £12, Cardiff-Glasgow return is £30.
* Megabus Gold has bunk-beds in place of seats, so you can sleep! (chosen for one stretch of Cardiff to London, both ways from Cardiff to Glasgow).
* Megabus Gold also has free coffee and tea, WiFi and snacks! All complimentary.
* 25kg luggage allowance.

**CONS:**

* The times are pretty inconvenient a lot of the time. For the search I did the bus leaves Cardiff at 23:30 and arrives in Glasgow at 07:00 the next morning, and on the way back you have to leave at 22:15 and arrive back in Wales at 05:45.
* Pick-up locations are usually a pain as well, and when I used it we pretty much got picked up at the side of a seriously busy road, which when there are around 50 people waiting to get on is pretty dangerous.
* Some journeys can take *ages*.
* It's still a bus, essentially.

All in all though it's certainly a start for reasonably-priced intranational travel.

true,Taure,null,null,"I've spent the last 18 months living outside the UK in Chile, so this is a pretty interesting question for me. Nothing brings these things into focus like living somewhere else. In particular there are many things mentioned in this thread as unique to the UK - positive and negative - which actually aren't so special.

**The price of trains**: they're almost universally expensive. A lot of countries don't even have a basic train network and buses are the only choice. Germany is the odd country out for having cheap, high quality trains.

**Housing**: Again, expensive almost everywhere. Not London prices of course, but an apartment in Santiago, Chile costs about the same (rent) as a house in Norwich did. (That said, buying is a lot cheaper, though prices are shooting up).

**The NHS**. Pretty controversial, right? Before I left the UK I was one of those who would have considered the NHS my religion. But here's the thing: all my experiences of Chilean healthcare have been superior to the NHS. And this is a country that many in the UK would refer to as third-world. 

- I can always see a doctor same-day. 
- If I want I can go directly to a specialist and have an appointment the same week I call. The same with dentistry: I can walk into any dentist's and be seen within 20 minutes, and have treatment (filling, etc.) immediately. 
- The care is also somewhat more comprehensive: because they're out to make money, they'll order a battery of tests where a UK doctor might consider you too low risk to make the tests worth it.
- Hospitals are nicer. Seriously. The hospital I use is like a five star hotel. Huge numbers of nurses means you get a lot of individual attention, and you get an individual room rather than sharing a ward if you're going to be in there for a while.
- The technology and the medicines are just as modern as those in the UK.

All of that for less money that I would be paying in the UK via taxation. I spend the equivalent of $1680 a year on health insurance. The average person in the UK spends the equivalent of $2815/year on healthcare (via tax). I have no out of pocket expenses for walking into a hospital: insurance covers everything. Dentistry is about the same price as the UK - insurance covers 80% of it. Similarly, insurance covers 80% of medicine costs.

So what's so special about the NHS? The fact that it covers the elderly and the unemployed, and the fact that it doesn't penalise women (women pay much higher premiums than men because they can get pregnant). If you have a job, insurance is compulsory in Chile. But if you're old or unemployed, or your job isn't so formal, you're only covered by the most basic government insurance which entitles you to shitty care. The UK fixed prescription costs are also amazing. Even if you're paying 20% of a prescription, for some medicines that could still be a lot of money.

A lot of people have a fear of private health care based on how screwed up the US system is. But don't forget that many of the best systems in the world - better healthcare than the UK by international rankings (which include access), like Norway - are private.

So what do I miss about the UK?

**The food**. 

Suck it, Frenchies! UK food is amazing. The variety of *good quality* international food available in the UK is stunning. Probably the only countries which equal it are the USA and Germany. 

UK food is also much healthier: all Chilean food is packed with salt. And anyone who has visited the USA will realise how natural UK food is. Hovis is practically homemade compared to the shit they pack into bread in the US. 

And then there are the specific things I miss: baked beans, gravy, sausages that aren't chorizo, real bacon, Indian food, fresh milk (everything here is UHT). And the availability of ingredients: in Chile, even the largest supermarkets only sell granulated sugar and icing sugar. No caster sugar, no golden sugar, no muscovado sugar, no demerara sugar, etc. Good luck baking! That lack of variety is uniform: only two real varieties of cheese (both of which are rather tasteless), only two types of flour (plain and self-raising), etc.

**The quality of the media.** 

This may surprise people complaining in this thread about tabloids. But imagine a country where the only choices of news media are either the Telegraph and the Daily Mail. Welcome to Chile.

And, obviously, the BBC.

**Pubs**

Everywhere in Chile you might go to drink in the evening is loud.

**Cheap consumer goods**

Especially books and electronics. I had to buy a laptop here in Chile after my old one broke: it cost me 800GBP. The same laptop bought in the UK would have been 600. And books are about twice as expensive here than in the UK.

**Sports infrastructure**

The UK is full of opportunities to play sports/do exercise.

**Punctuality**

In Chile if I say ""let's meet at 8pm"" people will arrive around 9:30.

**Clear air**

You don't realise how important air quality is until you don't have it.

**Efficiency**

Chile is unbelievably bureaucratic. It adds days, if not weeks, onto any process. I've been attempting to reclaim my pension payments back for about a year now. It's not clear if I'll have the process finished by the time I leave in March 2014.

**Green areas**

I miss big parks!

And what don't I miss?

**The weather**

October through to May is pretty much 28°C-32°C every day. Without fail. Reliable weather is amazing. It makes planning so much simpler.

**Lack of cafe culture**

Somewhat mitigated by the existence of pubs in the UK. Still, this is something the UK could further develop.

**Low quality wine**

A bottle of 3 pound wine in Chile would cost 10 pounds in the UK.

**Clubs**

Going dancing in Chile is much more fun than in the UK. It's simultaneously less aggressive/serious and more open. Everyone is far more enthusiastic and relaxed about in here. And if you dance with someone, you actually dance **with** them, not just next to them. Not everyone is a salsa expert, but everyone is happy to fake it and twirl each other around. Dancing with strangers is a matter of taking their hand and going for it.

The end result is that the infrastructure is terrible, and because the contract goes to the highest bidder, the rail fares keep going up to pay for the huge cost of winning the bid.

Best bit? There is very little that the private companies can do to improve the service they run: they don't own the infrastructure so don't re-invest.

true,r1pvanw1nkl3,mcgannnew,new McGann,"&gt;I think that's extreme given that those episodes are older than a lot of people talking about it.

What does the age of the episodes have to do with anything?  Most people aren't exposed to Classic Who until after they come to boards like these and find out they want to watch them.  It's not like some films, where you're expected to see them within a certain period of time or they'll be spoiled all over the internet.  It's a very niche thing.

Because of the frequency in which these classic episodes are referenced in discussion, we don't make spoiler rules mandatory for them.  We leave it up to the poster's discretion to mark spoilers that could spoil important plot elements for people who haven't seen them yet.  Spoiling a classic episode for people won't get you banned, but it'll make people think you're a jerk.

&gt;if that becomes the approach, then everyone marks their post ""spoilers"" to get people to read it whether it contains spoilers or not.

Umm, you're acting like the headlines are just ""SPOILERS"".  There's going to be other context there.  For example, if you're looking for news, which one would you click: ""[Spoilers] My Drawing of All The Doctors"" or ""[SPOILERS] Huge casting information for the 50th!""?

We've also had the same spoiler policy for a long time now, and this has yet to become an issue.  So I don't see your point here.

It has a brilliant nightlife, loads of bars and pubs and campus is a 30 minute walk from the city centre (10 mins on bus) and between 5 and 25 minutes walk from the private accommodation areas (Lenton is the main one) .

I'm not the sporty type but some of my mates are and they love the sports societies but I think that's pretty standard for all big unis. 

Nightlife is great, there's a different student night every weeknight, loads of clubs, bar crawls every other week and plenty of gigs. There's also loads of decent pubs if you prefer that. There's a DnB society which do house parties and club nights too. 

There's buses from campus and Lenton to the city centre running every 10 mins till 12 at night for a quid, a big train station in the city centre, booze is cheap, I'm paying 73 quid a week for accommodation in a private house. Don't know if you'd be housed by the uni or what but all the accommodation is either on the campus itself or a ten minute walk from it, can't remember then prices but it was reasonable (and full board if you're on campus). You joke about crime but I've not once seen anything (apart from when I buy weed I suppose). One of my mates was mugged but that's all that's happened in the two years I've been here.

Cheap drinks? Have we been going to the same Lola Lo?

My experience of Lola Lo's has been somewhat different; if you go on a Friday/Saturday night, it takes forever to get served, and can take an age for them to make one of their (admittedly very nice) cocktails. Last time I went, I couldn't even get remotely tipsy, let alone drunk; it took that long to get a drink.

Drink prices are about average for a cocktail in Cambridge, there's little risk of it being empty on Friday/Saturday, but the dance floors get rather cramped, since the venue itself doesn't offer much floor space. I do like the top floor smoking area though, as long as the weather's good - there's lots of space, but no ceiling. They charge on the door too, but it's worth going at least once to see if it's your thing.

Generally I prefer Fez on the quieter nights; still people there, but without the can-of-sardines effect.

&gt;Those who are genuinely suffering from mental illnesses, physical diseases or are genuinely sick should be looked after, so should our elderly generation. And our next generations future should be invested in now by getting the debts paid off, inflation right down and making the pound stronger.

And giving ATOS targets they *have* to met in finding people fit to work helps this how? On top of that It's been largely universally accepted that austatry was the *wrong* path to recovery anyway.

&gt;It's about fairness and the majority of the population who work 40hr weeks would agree with me.

Nice of you to speak for everyone there and nice of you to think that everyone is as inherently selfish and also ironically so short sighted as to want to cut holes in their own safety net as you are.

I've worked in plenty of jobs (mostly hospitality industry, bars and restaurants) where the management will only pay minimum wage, on shitty contracts, and pile on a fuck-ton of work load. Now, I AM generalising here (to address your first point), but the Eastern European workers we would hire would do the job, work fucking hard at it, and complain very little. The (very few) British we would hire would last weeks at the most, complaining the whole time, and doing everything in their power to do as little work possible. Now, I am NOT demonising them. Fuck, I WAS one of them. But the work ethic here IS different. When you're being paid the very bare legal minimum, being treated like shit by your employer, and getting shafted at every opportunity, you tend to not give a fuck about doing a good job. That didn't seem to be the case with the Eastern Europeans we would hire.

Now, again, I am NOT demonising the un/under-employed. I am saying that if you want to get people to do a good job, to actually give a shit and do the work, you have to pay them a living wage. If you pay people more, they tend to want the job more. It's not the fault of the British workers that they demand more, but it's also not the fault of the foreign workers that they are willing to work for less. Everyone wants to make a living wage, it's just that a living wage for a foreign worker seems to be less than a living wage for a Brit. It's pure market economics, but that doesn't mean it's not shitty for everyone involved.

true,indyK1ng,smith,Smith,"When TV first appeared on the scene, the actor's guild in Britain freaked over the prospect of there being reruns.  Their logic was that if reruns could be aired then there would be no more acting jobs.  As a result, they negotiated that the BBC could not air reruns.  This means that all tapes, once aired, were useless.  So in the 70s, before the BBC realized there was a home video market, they started scrapping tapes in their warehouse to make room for more tapes.  This includes a large chunk of Doctor Who and wiped out most of Troughton's run.

Over the years a good number of these episodes have been recovered through various means (actors with home TV recording, tapes distributed overseas, somebody took a copy home at some point, etc).  Right now the BBC has a bounty of one Dalek for a returned episode.

That's not to say that the lost episodes are entirely lost.  The BBC didn't destroy the audio versions of these episodes and stills from them do exist.  This has resulted in some episodes being fan animated (the BBC allows this as long as no profit is made).  Other serials have been adapted by fans for YouTube (specifically, ""Power of the Daleks"" got reimagined http://www.youtube.com/user/PowerOTDaleks?feature=watch)",0,1381068765,null,0,false,0,ccm3a0k,t3_1nth01,t1_ccm3a0k,t1_ccm274c,null,1429227493,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

For example: You've made at least 2 errors in your last comment  (and I've probably made a few in this one).

Typos happen. Grammatical errors occur. Names and pictures are occasionally confused. Facts are sometimes mistakenly misconstrued. Not all libel or slander is known to be false at time of press, and often it isn't intentional or malicious.  
There should be stricter guidelines on the reliability of sources, definitely, but not the daft one-size-fits-all punishment you're proposing.

If we were to live in your extreme version of media expression and suppression, everything would be watered down and flaccid, for fear of error.

Anyway, some of you are very creative and good at this type of thing, so I wanted to make sure I shared it with the creative Whovians here.

The British taxpayer was never asked or told that they were going to pay to prop up the loans in Greece, or that is where their money was going in order to keep the German currency alive - and despite it being against the Lisbon Treaty's own rules.

There is absolutely no reason why there couldn't be an Erasmus programme outside the EU, or why there shouldn't be academic coverage.  Nor is there anything to say that academics that are clearly specialised for a certain role wouldn't be able to waltz through a working visa line.

Got to love Boruc today, he made some top class saves. We were definitely helped by Swansea being quite wasteful, we just disappeared in the second half. And all I can say is every single time Fox plays, it makes me appreciate how good Luke Shaw is already. I'd rather see Clyne on the left and Chambers on the right, with only a little bit of game time I fully expect Chambers to be a far better wing back than Fox, and then I'd not feel so worried with him on the pitch. I'd be interested in knowing how many games Fox has played in the PL and we've actually managed a clean sheet.

Other than that, we played well in the first half, probably had a few chances to make it 2 - 0, but in the second we were definitely just staying too deep, unable to get out and play.

Speakers, amplifiers, processing, whole PA systems and touring companies - we've got a good percentage of the best in the world and always have had. That's impressive for the size of the population. 

I think it goes hand in hand with the music culture here, which I'm also quite proud of. There's always been a lot of festivals and clubs, and a really interesting range and development of underground sounds and sub-genres, you really can hear it all. We're also spoilt when it comes to some of the more homegrown genres like DnB, dubstep, breaks etc. Bassline culture has always been big here and that influences the PA manufacturers to ensure they're on top of things.

Another thing people don't always realise we make is world class cars, engines and high performance parts (I'm pleased Top Gear decided to highlight this). Not necessarily high volume production but if you want a competitive racing car for pretty much any class in the world you can have the whole thing designed and built in the UK. Many F1 teams are based here for that reason and Brits make up a large proportion of the people running each team.

In general, we're pretty good at some specific areas of high tech. manufacturing and tend to continue to be innovative in those fields.

I don't know what Hughton said to them at half-time, but it obviously worked because we were by far the better team in the second half right up until when Chelsea scored. RVW showed his skill to provide the assist for Pilkington, but otherwise had a fairly quiet game. After the goal I felt that we could have gone on to win the game; it was nice to see some attacking substitutions from Hughton, and Redmond looked bright, though Hooper was largely anonymous. The midfield triangle were excellent until Tettey's mishap for Chelsea's second. The defence were solid for most of the match too. Chelsea's second was truly awful from our point of view though. How they manged to score ten seconds after we had a corner is dreadful. Pilkington's corner was terrible, we'd committed too many men forward, Tettey basically gave the ball to Hazard and Ruddy let it squirm underneath him when he should have stopped it. There was nothing we could do about their third though, and Chelsea were able to pass the ball around for the rest of the match.

&gt; It always starts with simpletons beating people up in the streets, but once the conditions are right they become much more.


Then you agree the UAF must be banned? They are attacking people in the streets.

Youi say 'it always starts' as if there is an inevitable conclusion, but you only apply it to one side. 

Should the student union protests have been pre emptivley banned lest they lead to a communist coup? They were pretty destructive and used a lot of hateful language.

&gt;There is a specific strain of authoritarian state socialism which has been responsible for some truly terrible things

Nothing specific about it, Lenins vision was different to Stalins was to Pol Pot as Gueverras was to  the Scandinavian socialist who continued their eugenic sterilisation programmes up to the 70s.

Fuck all has been disavowed by the left, their most extraordinary ability is how their evil legacy not only fails to stick but can be turned around so hateful eugenicists like marie stopes who wanted to wipe out the degenerate classes through abortion are coopted as feminist icons pioneering womens autononmy over their bodies and Concentration camp Che adorns student digs and trade union offices throughout the land.

&gt;fascists

Which fascists? Whenever this is used there is invariable a likeing of groups like the EDL to Hitler yet I have not heard of their desired to annexe any other country or exterminate ethnic groups or hold big military rallys or support the state corporatism that distinguised mussolini and Hitler, in fact they seem to very much the opposite, supporting big state nationisations- much like the left.

The simpletons on the left are every bit as fascist in opposing freedom of assembly- when it suits them
freedom  of speech- when it suits them
suspension of civil liberties- when it suits them.   

&gt;Also I am not against people promoting their views if they don't try to be violent and intimidatory towards **vulnerable groups.** 

Utterly meaningless dog whistle, ethinic minoritys are not vulnerable groups, there is a huge industry built around proecting their feelins no matter what, it is enshrined in law and almost eveyr public service that not- whites are to be catered to at all times.

&gt; I should be able to physically oppose **a view** as horrific and destructive as fascism, whether that means just blocking the way or running them off the street so they don't want to do it again.


A view? A single monothlic intereptation shared by anyone you do not like, like some kind of genetic untermensch?

Very othering  and tribal is it not?

What if I dont like your view? Can I block your way or run you off the street? The law says no so what would you like the exemption in law to read? Why cant the  disenfranchised left behind working class run the middle class pricate school socialists off the streets if they dont like their views? Surely the lowest decile economic group with some of the lowest literacy and life expectancy can only be described as a vulnerable group battling against the moneied classes and their vested interests.

&gt;The argument against has been won,

What argument was that? Surely it is an openeed question to be addressed at the ballot box every five years, we are after all a democracy.

&gt;now all that is left is to a) stop its spread through education etc. and b) where it emerges it should be stamped out ASAP.

You are a man born out of time, you would do well in the red guard brother, unfortunately there is a little line about the freedom to hold an opinion without interference holding back the revolution, but with enough violence and oppression I have no doubt your kind will be able to bring about true peace and freedom.

**Ruddy** - Uncharacteristically shaky; dropped a high ball competing with Eto'o in the first half, and should have done much better with Chelsea's second. Couldn't do anything about the other two goals. **4**

**Martin** - Very solid at the back. Didn't offer that much going forward, but then he didn't need to. Made some excellent tackles. **7**

**Turner** - A decent performance. Didn't make any mistakes, didn't do anything special. **6**

**Bassong** - Similar to Turner; no costly mistakes, but nothing particularly good either. Lost the ball a couple of times at the halfway line. **6**

**Olsson** - Looked bright down the left hand side, putting in some good crosses. Had a golden opportunity to put us ahead but kicked air when he should have found the back of the net. **6**

**Tettey** - Very solid except for his awful mistake for Chelsea's second goal. Other than that was good, making tackles and spreading the play. **5**

**Fer** - Excellent as ever. A big presence in our midfield. Broke up Chelsea's play and set up some of our play. **8**

**Snodgrass** - Another disappointing display from him. Didn't offer enough going forward; too often tried to take on defenders when passing would have been a better idea. **5**

**Howson** - He's been impressive this season, and today was no exception. Excellent attacking play, and tracked back well. Could be key for us this year. **7**

**Pilkington** - Scored our goal, but then he could hardly miss. Made some good runs but his set pieces were abysmal. Partially at fault for the second goal. **6**

**Van Wolfswinkel** - Excellent header to set up Pilkington, but otherwise didn't have a huge impact. Hard worker though. **6**

true,DemonEggy,null,null,"I think we're agreeing here. Your first two paragraphs were exactly what I meant by ""...a living wage for a foreign worker seems to be less than a living wage for a Brit..."". A permanent UK resident, who has every right to expect a certain standard of living, can't live on the minimum wage, at least not for very long. A foreign worker, who is expecting less from life in the UK (because they see it as a temporary stop, or because they are coming from somewhere much worse), may find living on a minimum wage easier. 

I do, however, still take issue with your third point. As I said in my first paragraph, FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE, the foreign workers we hired DID work harder, and DID expect less, and DID accept worse conditions. I am, however, NOT saying this is a good thing. It is NOT the fault of the British workers for demanding more. They SHOULD demand more. And so should the foreign workers. BUT, the foreign workers are ALREADY getting more than they would in their homeland, which is one of the reasons they are willing to work for ""less"" here. Migrant workers are NOT intrinsically better, they are just willing to accept worse conditions/lower wages. It's the employers who are the ones who impose those conditions. 

I DO agree that the working classes are demonised in certain (ok, most) corners of the press. But if anything, I am attempting to demonise the greedy capitalists at the helm. Maybe I'm just not expressing myself very well!

On a related not, I do find it amusing/frustrating when the right-wing press can in one breath accuse the migrants of both being lazy benefits scroungers AND bastard job-thieves. Somehow they've both taken all the jobs, and not working, all at the same time.

On an average summer night, the industry is only running at 13% of wind capacity, sometimes there are days where turbines barely turn at all.  Windpower is a vanity project for some and subsidies for others; but it's not a solution.

           Hughes of Edinburgh University has demonstrated 
           that the capital costs of wind plus gas back-up are 
           up to ten times that of gas alone; that the net
           reductions in CO2 emissions are trivial or zero, and 
           that even on the most favourable assumptions, the

true,tizz66,cnty-expat,US Expat,"I moved to the US 6 years ago, so that's my point of reference.


Best:

- **British sense of humour**
- **British TV** (especially comedy; American drama is probably the best, but in other genres British TV is undoubtedly superior. Due in no small part to the BBC)
- **NHS**. Having to worry about money when falling sick doesn't even make sense to Brits. I have decent insurance here, yet even I have to wonder if I'm ""$20 sick"" to go to the doctor. I can't imagine what hell it is for poor people)
- **London**. I love London. There's few cities in the world that have so many iconic buildings in such a small area.


Worst things:

- **British pessimism**. This is tricky to explain, but it's something I feel. British people are so pessimistic about life, government, everything. I don't get that in the US. Even though there's huge divides in opinion in the US (more than the UK), it's because people feel it can be _better_, not that it's terrible now. In my experience, British people are very cynical. Life in the US is more positive, even in difficult situations.
- **Weather**. I do not miss rain, cold, getting dark at 3pm one bit. Where I am now, we have 4 well defined seasons where it is cold in winter and warm in summer, and it's perfect.
- **Prices**. This isn't unique to the UK, but everything is so expensive - especially housing. Money goes much further in the US (at least where I am).",0,1381074535,null,0,false,0,ccm4qcm,t3_1ntzzx,t1_ccm4qcm,t3_1ntzzx,null,1429226815,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

When people talk about Thorium it's often in relation to the promise of the next generation liquid flouride thorium reactors which can operate at low pressures.  We do already have operating Thorium reactors. There is enough Thorium to power humanity for thousands of years.  The world has enough Uranium for a couple of centuries.

Nobody is saying that we should stop researching hydro or solar technology, but that we shouldn't be subsidising implementing it into a solution *before* it works.  We've just spent decades subsidising one technology which is good for thousands of years and just as it becomes commercially viable you begin advocating subsidising another in actual application which promises to stall the economy and as such drastically hamper all research and investment.

It's lunacy.  It's not just 'higher fuel bills for a while', it's ever increasing fuel bills hampering investment and research into a technology we know will never work when the wind don't blow.  If you wanted to gently research hydro or solar in the sideline so there might be some extra applicable technology in a few decades or so, then that would be one thing.  To actively support raising fuel bills which sends manufacturing to coal powered China for a vanity project which will only ever be temperamental at best is madness.

Thankfully people and more and more nations are waking up to it.  Windfarms are about political agenda and subsidies, they're never going to be a part of an energy solution.   Even the subsidies are now working to the detriment of efficiency as manufacturers are changing gear ratios to achieve maximum subsidy and not maximum energy!

What we have now are these white giants springing up on peat banks that spend a couple of hours a day (if we're lucky) trying to dice up birds and piss off neighbours.

And the problem there is?  It's a subsidised scheme - if you're earning a decent salary, you'll pay back your loan, if you can't find a job or end up with a poorly paid job - you don't pay it back.  That's not really that bad a deal.

I would say however - while I don't think there's much wrong with loan system, I do think tuition fees should never have been allowed to go past £5k a year, £9k a year is far too much, and even though student loans are pretty good, the very idea of being £40k in debt will scare off a lot of students who would otherwise have gone to uni.

true,BlindMessiah,smith,Smith,"I've never seen a confirmation anywhere and I don't think there's anything in the episodes that explicitly confirm this interpretation (nor can I think of anything that absolutely contradicts this interpretation), it is one I am fond of.  The adventures happen in the order we see them for Amy and Rory, but as far as the Doctor is concerned TATM happens first and the other adventures follow that.  

The looks the Doctor gives the two of them throughout the episodes leading up to TATM seem to heavily imply that, but you can also read them as the Doctor's increasing sense of foreboding.  He knows what normally happens to his friends, something terrible.  And as was increasingly emphasized through 7A, Amy and Rory have been with the Doctor a long time and their lives have changed so much from The Eleventh Hour.  The Doctor could just feel that the longer he keeps them in the TARDIS, the greater and greater the chance something horrible will happen to them.  He knows this.  He is trying to wean himself off of them (and vice versa) but at the end of the day he just can't help himself.  He loves them too much to give them up.  He doesn't like endings.

I don't know.  I like the interpretation but I talk myself out of it.  

I think the problem with this reading of events is the Doctor's attitude in the Snowmen.  His shut off, bitter, cold attitude in that episode directly flows from what he suffered at the end of TATM.  The Doctor in the Snowmen didn't go off to be with his friends again after TATM.  He was right in the thick of mourning, sorrow, and anger.  Had the Doctor gone off to have more adventures with Amy and Rory after TATM, I don't think we'd see him suffer that much anger, guilt, and sorrow in The Snowmen.  The grief for the Doctor is too close and real in The Snowmen for it to take place anywhere else other than immediately (relatively speaking) after TATM.

His contract expires at the end of the season, and, from what I've seen so far, it shouldn't be renewed.

true,MrJMaxted0291,uk,United Kingdom,"Best things include:-

1) Ancient civilization with an incredibly rich culture and history.

2) Temperate climate where virtually no serious natural disasters occur and weather extremes are very rare.

3) One of the 10 richest countries in the world as measured in GDP. We enjoy a very high quality of life compared to a great deal of other countries.

4) One of the most robust and well designed legal systems in the world, which has been emulated pretty much everywhere.

5) We enjoy universal healthcare laws and a national health service that ensures our sick get cared for without having to worry they'll be made bankrupt in the process.

6) University loans from the government ensure equal access to advanced education for everyone. While you are expected to repay this, the terms of the loan are so beneficial to students that everyone has a decent shot at uni, regardless of their income.

Worst things include:-

1) The train service here is the most expensive and unreliable in Europe.

2) Housing prices are ludicrous in affluent areas and the amount of affordable housing for first time buyers is shrinking fast, making the dream of owning your own property further away than ever.

3) Gerrymandering of political boundaries has made a mockery of the democratic process in Britain. What we effectively have is a 2 party system akin to the Democrats and Republicans in the US. Voting outside of these 2 parties is virtually always ineffective and so we're stuck shuffling between the same two tired old parties with a third minority party very rarely playing kingmaker between the two.

Families support people 24/7 with maybe a few hours off during the day and maybe a week a year in respite. 

I've done this job for a long time and I'm not going to work the hours that a parent typically works. One example I know well is a lady that is in her 30s that lives at home. They have 20 hours a week of day services support (a place for her to get out of the home) and home care for another 20 hours a week. Now this lady is epileptic, mobile, has no sense of danger  and never sleeps for more then 30-45 minutes at a time. Her primary carer is her 50 year old mother. Now to place that lady in care safely I would have to have two members of staff looking after her 24 hours a day as she would require constant supervision. That means three shifts of two people every day which is £2 000 a week (that is a very low ball estimate  I would probably have to double that in real life) and that is before I look at holidays, sickness, paperwork and training.

Whereas in my home town not fifty miles away, I've been started on about a dozen times and got headbutted in the street once. I still prefer Fife for some reason though. Just feels more like home, and people are more genuine.

true,desmonduz,null,null,"many have noted the best thing about living in UK. Having Russian background, I think there are several negative points living in UK, especially in London.  

1) Drinking culture. Brits dont know how to drink at all. Either they drink til they are absolutely wasted and noone gives a shit about them drowning in their own vomit, or pathetically sip a pint of beer or glass of wine while STANDING outside/inside the pub, and pretending to be talking about some crap with 3-4 ""almost strangers"" (colleagues, elevator-aquaintances, the-guy-who-fixes-your-pc-at-work, or lady-who-posts-announcements-in-tea-room etc fall in to same category) who also make interseted faces, and bam! in 15 min at most your social circle falls apart and gets dissolved with other similar groups around you. so akward situation, you with a pathetic glass of wine in your hand try to squeeze into some other group and the same loop repeats over and over again, until you are sick and fucked up with this endless rotations, so you leave without saying goodbye to anyone. and noone really cares about it. You are grey and mundane mass, and thats all about being part of grown up british party. Thats not how we drink in Russia. Yeah, you might say we are tough with vodka drinking, but good thing is we always sit when we drink. in this way everyone's position is fixed, and you can talk with people around you without being interrupted by a sudden reorganization of people in your group.  you can get closer, talk about something personal and ultimately become good friend with people surround you. And most important thing, everyone talks some common topic. Also when we drink, we always eat some snack or sweet depending on the drink. Vodka goes well with pickled vegs and smoked meat or fish, cognac is good with chocolate or fruits etc.. we always have our table set before starting to drink. in general we have the way better friendly atmosphere while drinking together.

2) Individualism. Everyone cares only about his own shit. That makes people in UK socially isolated, closed and fearful towards strangers. People think that everybody around has his own freaks, and it is better stay away from him, and never let anyone to get closer. That damn notion of personal space, even in the queue you have to maintain that damn personal space, or someone may feel uncomfortable of your invasion to her personal fuckin space. Do I smell bad? or do you look that messy that my proximity annoys you this bad? Cmon, if something wrong with me please tell it straight away, i will thank you for this and go fix my problem. Say that for goodness sake. In Russia people usually mention that, no one talks about personal spaces, we are open and tell up to the point. And I think people in UK shpuld be little open to others, because we are all basically the same, law-abiding sane citizens, not freaks who start panicing on any reason.",0,1381078016,null,0,1381078446,0,ccm5u7g,t3_1ntzzx,t1_ccm5u7g,t3_1ntzzx,null,1429226298,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,kde01,king,,"I'm going to place most of the blame here on AVB. He should have seen that they were playing with 10 behind the ball, hoping for counter attacks, and he didn't adjust his tactics accordingly. Eriksen stayed in even though he was completely neutered by West Ham's midfield. We should have kept patient and kept passing the ball around to open them up. We needed to score first, and we didn't. Once you allow a defensive team like that to score it's game over. It's catanaccio from there til the end. And that is exactly what happened. 

Eriksen was taken out of the match, Gylfi didn't do anything, Defoe was worthless, and we were left with our only offensive power coming from Townsend crossing in to shorty Defoe for a header in. 

Soldado should have started this match. I understand that Defoe did well enough to start, but he should have started a game that he was fit to play in. Not this match. 

It's really a shame that AVB is sometimes just too stubborn to try and switch it up. The high line was not working that well, and it was so evident on the third goal. We needed to slow down play and pass around our back line, but there was no direction for that. We needed to play in from the wings, a traditional English game, and AVB didn't do that. Why wasn't Chadli brought in for Gylfi at or shortly after the half? Chadli would have been able to play some great crosses in for Soldado. 

AVB needed to adjust his tactics and didn't. Allardyce made him look like  an amateur. It seems like AVB forgot to do his homework this week and, when his original plan proved wrong, was too stubborn to change things around.

Worst: **Social unjustice** and class system. Why are so many forced to live on benefits? Why is the minimum wage not even enough to pay the electricity bill? Are kids growing up in poor families locked into the same social class as their parents? 

I think what we call the class system is some kind of coping mechanism. It's like the country really is 3-4 countries leaving in separate bubbles. Say you are working in a fairly OK job, have bought your own house (but the bank owns it), and you don't mind some sun-dried tomatoes and Chianti in the weekend - it's easiest to stay in a bubble with like-minded people so you won't have to every day face the unfairness of the bubble of people on benefits, who have to decide if the children get a new school uniform or hot food for dinner. Likewise, the bubble of people who have already got a couple of houses would rather stay in the bubble with and live next to other people who also play golf, go to the opera and enjoy weekends in a chateaux in France.

I am exaggerating here, but what I think is part of the class system is also a built-in *desire not to* leave your bubble - thus if you are on benefits you should not play golf. If you are rich, you should not like bangers and mash. If you are a low-paid call centre worker, you should not spend time on your garden.

This is all strange for me, coming from a country where I grew up in a neighbourhood where in one house lived a postal worker and cleaner, in another an air traffic controller, in another a teacher, next to a mechanic, a factory worker and an architect.  Everybody did different things, and yes, you could tell some had a fancier car than the others, but in practice everyone was pretty much treated as equals, and their kids went to do things that seem to not be fully (Although perhaps a bit!) predestined by their parents. The factory worker gets a son who becomes an electrical engineer, the architect daughter becomes a teacher, the ATC son a driving instructor.

Sam had his team doing a good job clogging up the middle and limiting Eriksen's (and either Soldado or JD) impact, seems to be something that we are seeing more of and we just haven't seemed to cracked on how to overcome it completely just yet.

We are in the midst of transitioning our squad but recently we have become a very deliberate team, everything seems to be very rehearsed and steady, a much slower podding pace to our attacks. It seems like the ""leash"" so to speak is still very much on the squad in terms of the attack, i think this will change but at the moment it seems like we have a group on the pitch who for the most part aren't willing to take a chance to make something happen.

In a game like today i don't know that it would have made a whole hell of alot of difference since Andros and Small Paul seemed to be the only ones interested in playing the entire game, but moving forward it would be nice to see us start being more aggressive and free flowing in attack.  Otherwise we are going to see a long line of matches with teams sitting back and clogging up the middle and bogging down our attack.

Again, fair play to Sam he put together a good plan and our team looked utter shit and sluggish.

Two things for me, that didn't make sense as far as AVB's decision making today:
1) Even if starting Defoe was justified based on his form, we all know Defoe is useless against a packed in defensive team and Soldado is more effective against that kind of defensive setup. And that's exactly what West Ham was always going to do, yet Defoe starts.

2) Where was Sandro? Maybe at 0-0 but certainly at 0-1 he should be on in the second half. Paulinho looked dangerous in forward positions and if he's going to be allowed to get further forward Sandro should be covering in front of Dawson and Vertonghen, not Dembele.

This weekend we were better going forward in the first but gave up a couple of good chances in open play. Second half their goal was just about the only time they got into our box.

If there's something in particular that looks like a problem its that when we're ahead we don't seem to always have a coherent plan for how we want to play. Some want to press while others want to drop deep and some players look like they want to keep possession while others want to launch fast counter attacks. Contrast Henderson amd Gerrard in the man united game for example.

I actually liked the second half of the villa game, it was almost arrogant how we flicked the switch at half time and went from pass and move to park the bus. The important thing was that everyone was on the same page tactically.

I guess brendan is telling the players to think for themselves on the pitch, to press if possible but to drop and counter if necessary.

They pressed us really well, shutting down our game through the middle. Townsend was our only real wide threat and though he had his moments we lacked width in any other form.

We defended corners poorly and so letting the first in the way we did came as no surprise but what did surprise me was the lack of response from AVB.

We'd already lacked some creativity so I assumed Holtby and Lamela would come on having performed well with Defoe in the Europa League but by the time they were both on it was 3-0 and well over.

I'm not going to be negative though. This is not the Spurs we've seen so far this season (I mean we let more goals in today than we have the whole season) so I fully expect us to bounce back against Villa.

true,Keratome,null,null,"my few thoughts.  
spurs is going to run into this strategy today from west ham all season unless we find a way to combat it  
In this match, left flank was missing, there were times townsend looked up to play a ball in the correct area  between top of left side of penalty box to sideline (where chadli/rose would usually be making runs into). Defoe is a counterattacking striker, he is as yet not skilled at taking up positions or holding up the ball and distributing (soldado way better against better opposition). Playing inverted midfielders on the flank with the wingers moving inside (and no overlapping defender moving down the flank on the outside) funnels the ball to the center of the field where most teams eg today are going to pack in defensively. Dawson is not fast enough to play a high line defense strategy if the other side has faster players (sorry to say it but its true, spurs have other options) .  
in future against teams like this, play soldado (obvious in retrospect), maybe a 4-2-1-3 (since the other team isnt pushing forward a lot) my lineup would be chadli/siggi, soldado, erikssen,townsend (4). paulinho, holtby/lamela (2), sandro (1) &lt;- this is key because of his albility to read attacks and play in front our defense, rose , vert/kaboul, walker  
I know you guys are going to say our defense is a bit thin, but thats the beauty of it , is that it encourages the other team to consider coming forward, opening up spaces in their formation, we have width, creativity,and speed (and football intelligence) plus a beast who will patrol in front our defense looking to f sh*t up  
again just my opinion , feel free to add/debunk, we all want to win all the games , we slipped up today, but its not catastrophic, it may haunt us later in the year; good, let it remind us that we cannot take any game for granted anymore.

However, the aims of those seeking an independent UK must first face the hurdle of a Scots referendum vote in September 2014. No proper decision on any other referendum regarding the EU may take place until the Scot issue has been decided once and for all.

Yes, I rant about Ukip and shall continue to do so in the same way that others rant about so-called control of the UK by the EU. It's necessary that certain points and facts are made clearly with language everyone understands, I'm sure you'd agree?

From what I can see, Ukip's real motive is to turn the UK into some kind of tax haven to further the noble cause of British and global investment banking. Such views are the sad result of chronic short-termism, decades of a UK press which is run by huge corporations owned by the likes of Rupert Murdoch and fan of German Nazism, Lord Rothermere.

It's time for UK citizens to choose wisely. The warnings of Neil Kinnock have turned out to be true. Such a pity these were not heeded at the time.

Personally, having been born in the UK and then spending more than 20 years living in Europe amongst Europeans, I think that the 17-year old Ralph Miliband was a very astute young man.

He doesn't cause a structural problem for our attack. He is doing exactly what AVB is telling him to do. It's not very hard to see that if he was doing something contrary to what the manager was telling him he would be pulled from his starting position. AVB needs to direct him to maintain width and not keep cutting in, and he played matches last year on the left where he did just that.

His tactic was effective as hell.  Knowing that we were playing a striker who can't get a head on the ball allowed them to let crosses in while freeing up his defenders to instantly smothering our playmaker(s) in the middle of the park.

They absolutely did not allow our midfielders any time on the ball once we got into their half.  

Call it anti-football, but we should have had a tactic to counter that.  Perhaps put in a taller player than defoe. to either knock balls down or into the net.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"Personally I'd avoid British higher education like the plague. Universities here have become cash hungry buisnesses over the last decade, and they specifically target people like you. The universities now rely far too much on the value of their reputation and teaching standards are pretty poor. Most courses consist of the minimum amount of teaching time and under-taxing content. The older more prestigious institutions do have slightly better standards but the new generation of universities are just factories for churning out cheap international gradutes. They also tend to have very low standards (since if they give people mediocre results then those people won't encourage their colleagues back home to attend that institution). In a nutshell, a british masters degree is a degree for cash - the value of which may not hold true much longer.

You really have two choices these days imo;

* 1) Go to the USA and PAY, but in return get a solid education that WILL push your limits both academically and financially.

* 2) Stay in Scandinavia and get the freebie socialist education, the short term cost saving will offset not having a 'sexy' international degree in the long run.

But steer clear of the UK unless the academic component is actually ancilliary to your main reasons for wanting to come here (like for the culture/lifestyle etc.) We have created a system that takes the worst of both - the teaching standards of European universities with the costs of the USA.

i get what you're saying in your first post too, the cynicism is quite depressing sometimes and i think everyone knows it and gets tired of it at times (hence eagerness by many to adopt american culture here). relative shortage of non service industry employment i dont like either. judgement culture is related to class system, very quick to label people and beleive in the labels too, similar in ways to the archetype american highschool, just different labels, you're assumed to behave how you dress. 

the food comment aswell i especially agree with, ok you can get fresh food here easily but its usually in one corner of the shop while the rest is junk food, ready meals, frozen food and boxed/canned stuff, the fresh produce in most shops is still not all that fresh, go abroad and into your average shop and the majority of it will be fresh meat, dairy, fruit and veg more often than not. thinking about my local shop, you have a chilled section with some ready meals, a few packs of sausages, the occasional pack of mince, a little cheese, lots of milk, then milkshakes, cans of juice and those cold coffee things. then another maybe 1m x 1.5m of shelf space with carrots, onions, tatties and maybe some apples. that's the entire fresh produce section of my local shop (not including bread/cakes etc) and it must be only about 10% of total shop space.

lack of demand for quality from consumers i agree with too, though its related to how expensive everything is i think, especially in things such as houses, with the cost of them being so high above the heads of people here, they'll take anything they're given, hence why modern british housing is generally so fuck ugly.",0,1381083931,null,0,false,0,ccm7zd0,t3_1ntzzx,t1_ccm7zd0,t1_ccm5466,null,1429225226,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

He was pretty unintelligible but could hold a tune and I was quite enjoying this bit of festive cheer.  Anyway, the woman at the front turned round angrily to look at him.

true,DunkeyKung,null,null,"I'm actually a little surprised by this comment. I just moved to Manchester from Ottawa and I'm under the impression that the UK's train system is much better and vastly more affordable than Canada's.

For example, a weekend train ticket for a five-hour journey from Ottawa to Toronto (two large and important cities) costs about $230 CDN dollars including return. Unless you get the 3-week-in-advance price in which case it will be around $140.

Here, a trip from Manchester Picadilly to visit my relatives out in a small rural area in Pembrokeshire, Wales (also five hours) for the weekend will cost me 65 pounds including return, only 40ish since I have a railcard. And I can purchase the ticket for that price at any point leading up to the train's departure.

Not only that, but the trains come far more frequently and you can use one ticket to get on any train that day, whereas with VIA Rail Canada everything is reserved in advance and if you miss your train your shit out of luck. Also the via rail cars are less comfortable than here with less legroom, it feels a lot more like travelling by plane. 

The bus prices in Canada are just as bad as well. You're looking at $50 one-way from Ottawa to Toronto and the conditions on those greyhounds are appalling. I'm guessing this price inflation is the result of sheer geography, with Canada not having the population density that allows for consistent pickups/dropoffs that help to cover costs.

Granted, I haven't used the rail system in continental Europe at all, so maybe relative to them the UK system is still steep. But I thought you should know that you definitely don't have it so bad here.",0,1381085315,null,0,false,0,ccm8h29,t3_1ntzzx,t1_ccm8h29,t1_ccm16gc,null,1429224995,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

* The NHS.  Better than US-style ambulance chasing and staying in jobs you hate just because of the healthcare benefits.

* Devolution.  Trust me, England *needs* home rule because Westminster is a joke that shafts the English continually because they've run out of dragons to slay

* The BBC.  For all its faults, it's still leaps and bounds better than many foreign offerings

* The climate, because it's manageable.  I post in /r/C25K and it's full of Americans saying ""Derp, it's 398 degrees in Cuntsville Texas with 450% humidity so I have to use a treadmill because it's too hot to step outside unless it's between 11pm and 2am"" and ""I'm in Michigan and in late July we get 3 miles of snow"".

**Worst**:

* The petty, stupid ""north vs south"" shite.  Apparently if you're not in Manchester or London you can fuck off

* The entire economy revolving around an artificially inflated, rigged housing market and City casino gambling

* The obsession with ""getting on the property ladder"".  See above, nobody can afford it

* Broken, ""soft touch"" courts and justice system

* The frightening speed at which the rich/poor divide is ever widening

* Chavs and benefit culture

* Antisocial behaviour and general petty crime .  The police don't have any real teeth ('yoomin rites') and the courts aren't strict enough

* Transportation costs, particularly rail.  Edinburgh &lt;-&gt; Madrid (for example) by air is often cheaper than Edinburgh &lt;-&gt; London by train.

What's most annoying is that these major investigations are triggered by a single individual making a complaint. Often the individual making the complaint has no relationship to the author *or* the subject matter of the tweet itself. It always staggers me how the Black Lawyers Association can involve the police about a ""racist"" tweet when none of them were a target of the tweet or involved in any way in the circumstances surrounding the tweet.

However let's not ignore the fact that today we were woeful and I don't think the team selection helped.  I read on twitter at half-time that our only bright spark was Townsend.  After his second half I don't believe we had any bright sparks.

It's been said enough that West Ham always manage to raise their collective performance against us, so it's difficult to understand why people like Sandro and Holtby didn't start, especially given that Defoe did - that's in reference to the understanding that JD and Holtby have got in the Europa League.

Personally I think that we need to play our strongest available side, and despite their performances in the EL, Defoe is not part of that IMO.  And nor for that matter should Siggy or Townsend.  That's not to criticise them for their performances so far this season, just that I think Holtby has deserved a starting slot and Lamela offers more that Townsend.  I do believe that coming from the bench to specifically target tiring full backs should be what we use Townsend for, and I surely can't be the only one who noticed that when he got to the outside he was so much more of a threat than when he tried to cut inside.  WH clearly knew to double up on him when he switched to his left foot.

Fair play to west ham for getting it completely right on the day but damn, we didn't look interested let alone a threat for 85% of the match. 

I don't think we can really blame AVB for much (the man looked like he wanted to cry after the game, love him), none of the players on that pitched just looked up for it, fit or cohesive in anyway. Defoe was anonymous, can see why AVB gave him his shot, but he's done as a starter IMO, Soldado and even ade just add so much more to the team. Walker clearly had an injury and didn't have his head in the game at all, shouldn't have played. That said, I do think we need a real defensive mid on the pitch Sandro/Capoue with dembele/paulinho/erriksen combo ahead.

More than anything, I think we REALLY miss aaron lennon at the moment, we need that pace and width he offers on the right. Townsend has been shocking, he thinks he's bale but he most definitely is not. I would rather see him playing on the left to see what he can do there personally.

The area I live -- inner-city Protestant area of Belfast -- is quite unique as it's one of few areas where caucasian people are split by the factor of religion (elsewhere in the U.K., it tends to be due to nationality (white Eastern Europeans) or, more commonly, due to physical differences (skin colour; religious dress), or, also, religion itself (Islam/Sikhism/Hinduism/etc.), and that last reason is generally has race interlinked with it).

Where I am, because the majority are White, the people haven't had any influence of migrant workers (due to The Troubles up until the mid-90's), and have fought -- literally -- to hold on to the little semblance of culture they have.  This means *any* change to the status quo makes them feel a threat to their ethnic identity, and they tend to react through racism. 

Within the past year the racist incidents I can remember: Nigerian men lived in a council house and had K.K.K. spray-painted on to their door for intimidation; a family of Black origin (father, mother, daughter) left their home (and the country) after a brick came through their window; there are definitely more, I just don't pay much attention to the news these days.

Although, in more affluent areas race is a non-issue.  This might sound frivolous to you, but where I work, I have people with Irish-sounding names working alongside people who are Protestant with no issues between them at all.

AVB basically banked on us getting the first goal. As soon as West Ham were forced to attack holes would have opened up for us to exploit. 

Allardyce knew the same about us, this is a match we should be winning, a WH team would settle for a draw. He could gamble on us not breaking the defence and throwing more forward leaving us exposed.

It wasn't that AVB was too stubborn to change his tactics, it's that his starting set-up wasn't ideal, and after they scored there wasn't really anything radical he could change.

true,Ginto_Maldari,eng-lancashire,"Lancashire, Blackpool","Positive things:

-History of some of the towns and cities
◘Blackpool used to be a great tourist town, and namely the North and Central station provided freight and passengers to the center of town. Unfortunately in the 60s, the Beeching cuts removed central station up to South station, and lifted a lot of the railway. This is my personal belief that this act has fucked tourism and such, along with other things.

◘York is also a beautiful city, I visited there last December. Visiting the NRM was very nice, and I forgot just how large the trains really are. the 9F 2-10-0 locomotive has wheels taller than me for christs sake.

◘Also, just England in general. Did you know that one of the first Kings of England planted forts in specific locations so that they would turn into towns and cities in the future? This guy knew what was gonna happen. London was also a specific one, I believe he had a fort that covered both sides of the Thames, so that it could be crossed easily and there would be no trouble. Eventually, London, York, etc happened centuries later.

-Going along with the history thing, we were also leading in innovation around the 18th to 20th century periods.
◘Invented and developed the train providing a whole new form of transport and thus city, town, village, hamlet growth
◘We had an Empire and thus with this, our inventions at home were developed across sea. This has allowed us to plant railways in countries that probably wouldn't have put them there so early on if we hadn't put them in our Empire. India, for one, and Africa is another.
◘I believe we developed a pretty good Agriculture, until other countries started catching up of course
◘Superior as all hell in medicine. While we were backwards, we started to get our shit together and kickstarted incredible medicine and health advancements
◘We were, if I remember correctly, the first country to start industrialisation. This is pretty much one of the most important things in our history alone.

-The people
◘There's a fantastic amount of people in the UK. You always hear bad things, but there are so many good people. I, personally, love it when people say ""hey are you British you sound really posh"". I don't even act on it (95% of the time), it's awesome. Other's equally have awesome accents from places like Yorkshire.

What, to me, would be: The river is flowing the wrong way
Would be, to them: T'riv'r is flown t'wrong wey.

(T'riv'r would be said as Teh-Riv-Rh, almost like River, but less emphesis on the E. At least this is how it was when I last went there)

-Just Britain
◘The flag, the people, the landscape, the countryside...it's just British. Well, of course it is, it is Britain afterall.




And for the negative:
-The people
◘During the day you get all sorts of people, friendly, nice, douchebags, morons, assholes...but during the night, why bother? At least in Blackpool, anyway.

◘Druggies everywhere. Druggies by day, druggies and prostitutes asking you if you want a good time when you are waiting for the bus while you don't want to put up with her shit and just tell her that your girlfriend can do a better job for free and see her walk away in anger.

◘Bus change beggars. Saw this guy, with a bike that looks like it cost £900, sit down OUTSIDE MCDONALDS ASKING ME FOR BUS CHANGE. What the fuck? By the way, also had all these fancy ass keep-warm clothes like thick coats that you know are expensive as fuck without even looking properly. Come on. I'd rather give the floor painters money, they make amazing artwork.

-The drivers
◘This applies to many western places but never have I seen more videos of people hating on cyclists more than the UK. I'm riding on a bike path and you're shouting at me to get off the road? The hell? And the pedestrians shout this too, or tell me to get off the pavement. Should I just phase through the ground instead? Jesus christ...

◘Bus drivers being constantly early or late at really really inconvenient times. By early, I mean 30 minutes early and the next one is an hour late. Jesus christ I hate that. By late, I mean 30+ minutes late past the expected time of arrival. In that time I could've walked home. BUT AS SOON AS I DO THAT, IT WILL APPEAR.

Another thing they do is waiting at bus stops for more than 10 minutes. I'm not here for a coffee break, I'm here so I can not be late for college because I'm too physically exhausted to ride a bike you jackass. I go down and he's reading a bloody newspaper, what the hell?

-Sometimes obscure, pointless things
◘In many cities there's roads that are uncomfortable because they are rocky roads. Whether it's gravel or bricks that are bumpy, why would we do that? What the hell? I have never felt so uncomfortable in a car [weather excluded] than I do when it comes to the bloody rocky roads. Just lay some tarmac down jesus christ I don't want to be riding in a crumpled car by the end of the road.

◘Disrupting roads (in places like Blackpool's town center) for sometimes trivial reasons. ""We're doing up this road that we did last month despite the fact it looks like it was laid down yesterday"". Why? Leave it alone you morons! (@ the Council)


Conclusion: I always look on the bright side, and this makes me happy. You will always find good people, even if you think they're putting it on, at least they're putting it on and not being grumpy gits.

* 7 games is 18% of the season, 8 is 21%; so we're a decent chunk of the way through.
* 16 points from 7 games is 2.29 points per game.
* 2.29 ppg over 38 games is 87 points.
* 1.80 ppg for the last 31 games gives a points total of 71.8/72, which would typically give 4th place (it was 73 last year, 69 year before).
* 2.00 ppg for the last 31 games gives a points total of 78, which would have given 2nd last year and 3rd the year before.
* Last year we averages 1.6 ppg, which would give us a total of 65.6/66 points, which would have given us 6th last year and 5th the year before.
* We went from 1.3 ppg in 11/12 to 1.6 ppg in 12/13. I therefore wildly assume that we'll gain another .3 ppg, to give us 1.9 ppg and leave us on (72.2/73 points for 1.9ppg for 38 games) 74.9/75 if we average 1.9 ppg for last 31 games

Defoe was an option for through balls to run onto. We managed it once, and if Defoe had taken that shot instead of hitting it into the keeper the game was ours. West Ham would have to attack us and that would have given us the space.

Naughton was out of position, and in all honesty it's disrespectful to ""hate"" a player who is trying for the club. It's fine if you don't rate him but it's not as if the guy is a scumbag who is purposely hurting the club by acting like a tool.

Dawson may not be our best CB option, however with Kaboul injured and Chiriches likely still getting to grips with our team he was the best option today.

The famous English gardens and parks are either unkept because there are no men to take care of them, or they are being used to grow needed vegetables.  British taxicabs look antique because Britain makes tanks for herself and Russia and hasn't time to make new cars.  British trains are cold because power is needed for industry, not for heating.  There are no luxury dining cars on trains because total war effort has no place for such frills.   The trains are unwashed and grimy because men and women are needed for more important work than car-washing.  The British people are anxious for you to know that in normal times Britain looks much prettier, cleaner, neater.

There were two types of cover (now discontinued in favour of a completely different pricing structure), one of which was completely optional but covered you for repairs and replacements for breakdown or accidental damage (lasting longer and covering more scenarios than a manufacturer's warranty) and the other of which was optional if yo u had your own contents insurance (compulsory otherwise) and wrote off the remaining value of your agreement in the event of fire or theft.

Both of these were labeled on price tickets and explained thoroughly with every single agreement that we set up - we received bulletins at least once a month and in every bit of training stressing that this was absolutely mandatory. Cancelling either wasn't difficult - you simply told us you wanted to do it, brought in proof of insurance in the case of the fire/theft cover, and it was removed from your next payment onwards.

Most people in this thread consider higher education to be priced low because they mostly compare it to the US system, which is severely fucked up. Contrasting it to other European countries, the UK (excepting Scotland) tuitions costs aren't that low.

Scotland offers free education for EU members. Other countries that do that include Austria, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden. In some of those, education is free for any nationality. Countries like France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Switzerland offer mostly cheap higher education for EU citizens, none charging more than 3000 Euros for an academic year. On the high end of the spectrum lies the UK, charging from £3500 to £9000 per year.

In 2011 to 2012, there were 54% fewer fire non-fatal casualties and 34% fewer fire fatalities than in 2001 to 2002. 

But in spite of this reduction, average response times in 2011 to 2012 were higher than in 2001 to 2002 by around 22% for dwelling fires and by around 29% for fires in other buildings.

Even if there are less fires, you still need almost as much cover to maintain response times. And given that response times are rising, it seems short sighted to the point of negligence for the government to be reducing cover still further.

First of all, just because West Ham happened to be near the drop zone after six, SIX, games doesn't necessarily mean they're relegation fodder. Big Sam is no dummy and is very experienced at this being a manager thing. West Ham had some luck, but also some class; I think they could finish as high as 12th-10th. 

Second, this was a derby between two teams that have a reasonable rivalry. It's not as easy as ""Well, they're lower down in the table and we're at home, so therefore we should 100% win the match."" The intensity of games like this can often drive the ""underdog"" to exceed expectations.

I think that's quite a gentle definition of socialism. In fact social democracy can and does include some elements of worker control and/or ownership. The Coop movement, for instance, alongside John Lewis and Waitrose, must be the most middle-class of institutions, but they are worker-owned.

I was pretty pissed at him this summer but hope he takes his opportunities to make amends for his behavior both by playing and behaving well. Him and Sturridge really seem to have a lot of potential together which to me means tactically he has become even more valuable. 

If he doesn't want to play for the club past this season though, I wouldn't want him here, although we must get enough of a fee to sell him. I'd say if we are looking to sell him next summer (I've read rumors of teams interested this winter, but I see basically zero ways this would be good for us) I think 50 million should be the minimum to consider. He is certainly one of the top strikers in the world, whether top 10 or 5 or whatever and recent transfer inflation means we would not be getting market value for his abilities if we sold him for less than 50 IMHO. A bid of say 65 million or over would be where I would consider selling him even if he was good with staying. In an ideal future I would prefer to keep him and Sturridge as not only are they world class but seem to have a great understanding, something that would not be guaranteed by his replacement even if said striker was as talented. But again, this is only if he wants to play for Liverpool, I think having a reluctant star does more harm than good ultimately.

&gt;We aren't tapping up Bayern players and announcing it on our website. Nor is it a particularly impressive feat that BR and Stevie made the arduous 20 minute ride to Manchester so that Shaqiri could squint up and see what a team that's not in the Champions League looks like on a Tuesday night.

That's a fair point, but I don't think the idea would be that he (or whoever the target is) could physically see them; just that now they can say ""We're serious, and as proof we sent BR and Stevie to scout you personally"" or whatever.

&gt;The story on the site was being tongue in cheek when it mentioned we were there scouting.

Could be, but it's a bit odd to repeat the joke then, no? If it was only there once I could see it being a throw-away joke, and I suppose it's possible that it still is and LFC's web staff just sucks and journalism/humor.

Forget our offensive ineffectiveness, protecting Lloris is always priority #1 because a tie is better than a loss (for points and morale).

Halftime AVB should have pulled Dembele and Walker off. Put Kaboul or Chiriches on, move Naughton over to the right and Jan at LB. Put Sandro in for Dembele to protect the defense and let them sit back a little (and especially with how high up Paulinho was playing).

AVB deserves to be criticized a bit for his stubbornness. Maybe eventually he'll relax and start making changes sooner in matches and changes that alter his original tactical plan, but he doesn't do it now. A manager needs to know when his plan won't work and he needs to know how to change things up. Mourinho did it very well against us last weekend, and that's why they almost won the match. Had AVB been able to make the right changes and keep Chelsea on the back foot we may have been able to win the match. 

Same thing here today. If AVB had made the right tactical and player changes early enough, we would have come up with 3 points. The ability to make the right changes as well as the humbleness required to know when you made a mistake in your pre-match planning (and then be proactive about changing your tactics) are crucial for top managers. That is what separates the best from the great managers. 

AVB has the knowledge to be a top manager but he's a bit stubborn with some of his choices. He only has 4 years of experience, though, so I understand why he continues making these mistakes. The more mistakes he makes now the better we'll be next season. We're building a strong base for the future so we need to always make sure our next year is better than our past year. If AVB sees this year as a good building block and learning opportunity for the whole squad and himself these mistakes won't be a real loss. If he continues being stubborn and doesn't change his ways that's when we'll have some issues.",0,1381105442,null,0,false,0,ccmfo98,t3_1nv7yu,t1_ccmfo98,t1_ccmdmmo,null,1429221461,8,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,8

true,rydleo,null,null,"I doubt he'll stay, certainly not past this summer and perhaps even sooner.  Suarez only cares about Suarez and he can make more money playing for Real, City, Chelsea, or any number of other clubs than Liverpool.  If he truly cared about playing in the CL and winning trophies over money, he simply would have stayed at Ajax who pretty consistently do both, so the argument that he just wants to play CL and compete holds little water for me.

I wouldn't be surprised at all if he left in the January window, subject to us getting a sufficiently acceptable bid.  His agent is already apparently going around to certain clubs and angling for a move with the context that Suarez is not cup tied in the CL, which will make him much more attractive to some.  There are also rumors that he's told people close to him that he expects to win the CL with Real this year which seems to say something for his mentality.

I think there is no chance he gets a new contract as that makes absolutely no sense to the club.  He's already top or thereabouts in terms of wages and the only amount that would make him happy would probably be something near double his current salary and we simply can't afford that (not too mention it would unsettle others).

For me personally, I'll be quite happy to see the back of him.  He doesn't want to play for Liverpool and was willing to move to a pretty clear rival for some coin- pure mercenary move on his part (as well as being an ass about it) and that added to his track record of idiotic actions means I'll be quite happy to see the back of him and a few quality players coming in the other direction.",0,1381105516,null,0,false,0,ccmfp5t,t3_1nv99d,t1_ccmfp5t,t3_1nv99d,null,1429221450,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0

true,robdabank,JE,jersey,"**Impressed**: Oscar. He's been performing so well as an attacking midfielder that it made the press (and a staggering number of people in this subreddit) worry that it would effectively put Juan Mata out to pasture. 

That Juan Mata. The 2 time CFC Player of the Year and last years Players' Player of the Year.

I'm not a Chelsea or football expert like a lot of the older guys on here are, but when you [Oscar] start playing at a level that makes people speculate about the sale/squad relegation of your previous season's player of the year... You're doing something right.

Oscar moves the ball really intelligently, he tracks back and forth across the pitch but still plays an effective AM role, he's put a lot of the doubters to bed about whether or not he'd be strong enough in the EPL despite his slight (albeit sturdy) build.

Really stoked to see him do well the rest of the season.

**Not Impressed**: This is tough because I think I'm a persistent optimist and *really* think everyone has shown promise with their time on the pitch thus far.

But...

Ashley Cole: I'm a little less cynical, I think, than some other people posting about him. 

I still think Ashley Cole is our best option at left-back, and is one of if not the best left-back in the world.

That being said, I think his ability to play balls to wingers is sort of in question. I don't think his attacking ability is as sharp as it used to be. That being said, I'm not willing to concede that it's his age - it might just be a dip in form.

Also, I don't think his defensive form is off at all. His timing on defense has always been impeccable, and I think not using Ashley Cole makes the team weaker defensively by a sizable factor.


Kevin De Bruyne: This might be premature but I haven't really been convinced. Aside from the assist at Hull he hasn't done much. He was a big player at Bremen last season, and I remember him taking a lot of attempts from range. From what I've seen, he hasn't been all that convincing, but then again he's played like 3 times and could use more minutes.

If we have no good chances against them in the first half, the plan isn't working. If Defoe isn't getting any of the ball, not making any effort to see the ball, and not helping anyone else with the ball, the plan isn't working. If Eriksen is completely shut out of the game, the plan isn't working. If a collapsed left flank makes defending our offense too easy, the plan isn't working. 

All those things could and should have been changed *before* the goal. All of those were obvious before the first goal. I was nervous about the match before the end of the first half, and I rarely worry about a match that early. What we were doing was tantamount to banging out head against a cement wall and hoping the wall would give. A few simple changes would have widened our attack, forced West Ham to open up, and allowed us better chances in on goal. But those changes weren't made at all or not until the last minute. 

Why wasn't Chadli on to give width before the 50th minute? Why wasn't  Sandro brought on to shut down their chances at counter attacking when it was so obvious that was the only way they could score against us? Why was Eriksen left playing when it was obvious he didn't have the energy to handle his two or three markers? 

Chadli, Sandro, and Holtby on by the 60th minute could have prevented the goals scored and allowed us to score one or two and win the match.

The test to determine if a given course of behaviour constitutes harrassment is whether a ""reasonable person"" would consider it so. There are quite a few laws that use this test, which allows the court to consider the nuances of a case.

The article is light on details and comes off more as a PR article to boost the fame of a politician (I came away from that article thinking more about the ""Holyrood legislation allowing public sector bosses to refuse work to firms who use controversial zero-hours contracts"" than I did about some weirdo staring) but from what little we have been given, I, being in my own opinion a reasonable person, would say that someone sitting outside your place of work staring at you could well constitute harrassment.

For now we are hoping for top 4, and losing a game once in a while to a bad team won't jeopardize that. If we win all the rest of the games, and even if we just draw against top 4 teams, we can and will still get top 4. Last year was an exception, but typically 70 points is enough to get top 4. I think it will be in a league as competitive as our this year. And lookit, we are on a trajectory to get 70.

But the BBC CD releases have linking narration instead of subtitles (obviously, subtitles would be difficult on audio), and many find them easier to listen to than watching reconstructions.",0,1381113992,null,0,false,0,ccmiqhb,t3_1nvlw3,t1_ccmiqhb,t1_ccmgmxv,null,1429220033,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

For me, I don't think it's about CL or whatever, I think it's simply about money.  Liverpool pay well, but not as much as many other clubs and that isn't going to change even if we get CL or win the league.  There was a decent article on here recently someone linked to that talked about how Suarez worked hard and did whatever was needed to get what he wanted- e.g. his move from Uruguay to Groningen to be closer to his then girlfriend.  I think what he wants most of all is absolute financial security for his wife and kids and this is not something I can complain about at all having a family myself.  The career of a footballer is relatively short and he's got maybe 6 years or so left of major earning potential and his next move is likely to be his biggest (in terms of transfer fee/loyalty bonus, signing on fee, and salary)- that's why I think he wants to go.  Being a Liverpool legend is nice, having a metric shit ton of money in the bank is much nicer (for him- for me, I'd take legend status every day of the week and be happy with a small fortune).  I don't begrudge him a bit for wanting to leave, it's the way he's gone about that is all wrong.

EDIT:  I'd also add that I believe Real want either Suarez or Aguero after Benzema leaves.

Flexible tickets - these allow you to travel on multiple trains, These come in multiple types, the main ones being peak and off-peak, if it's an off-peak ticket it's much, much cheaper, but you can only board the train in off-peak hours (in general this means the train can't leave the station you got on at before 9.30, but this does occasionaly vary).

The cheapest way to get a ticket is generally just to buy an advance ticket as far as possible in advance (they tend to come out a few months before the day of travel), so if you just monitor the ticket websites and buy them the day or the day after they come out you should get the best value, provided you don't need the flexibility.

In terms of ride experience, you can go for first class (it's a lot more expensive, but you get free food, comfier seats and a first class lounge, though don't think of it as airline standard at all). It's probably not worth it as it is quite a lot more than a normal ticket, but if you see a special offer and it's only a few pounds more then go for it definitely.

The best way to optimise your ride experience is to choose a train that's likely to be as empty as possible to be honest, crowded trains are no fun, especially as it means you may have to ask someone to move out of your seat (though I'm British so I think socially awkward situations like that are the worst, you may not mind so much). Especially, avoid a football crowd if you at all can. Basically here, try not to travel on a Friday or Sunday afternoon or evening as these trains tend to be packed (especially the Sunday ones as fewer trains run on a Sunday).

Also, I'm not sure of the ins and outs of buying tickets abroad, but in terms of buying them in the UK (if you have a UK friend to get them sent to, then [East Coast](eastcoast.co.uk) who runs the train you'll be getting don't charge booking fees, but lots of people prefer [thetrainline](thetrainline.com) which charges £1.50, which isn't much in the grand scheme of things.

Oh, and just for reference, it gets dark in Britain (especially Scotland) really early in winter ([according to WolframAlpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sunset+edinburgh+21st+december) on the shortest day of the year the sun is going down in Edinburgh at 3.41), so as you said you want to be seeing countryside out of the window, don't leave the train too late.

Any more questions let us know, and [this website](railforums.co.uk) is also a good one for train information (though unless you want to suffer a total shitstorm for the love of god don't mention the railway unions, rail staffing cuts or generally any politics at all).

They redistributed most of the rural land back to the peasants and left them working for themselves, which was great for a while, but then after a few bad harvests, the successful ones ate up the unsuccessful ones, bought their land and employed them, and became the much-hated kulak class. Flash forward to Stalin, who did most of the driving forward to industrialisation, killing untold numbers in the process, and also turned on the kulaks, killing or imprisoning most of them too in order to socialise their holdings and set up farming collectives.

But anyway, back to the main point. Lenin introduced very little genuine socialism to Russia, it was a case of self-employed peasantry (which is compatible with socialism, but hardly social) and urban State capitalism with large enterprises run like Western firms but with party members as managers and the State as owners, all run by a bureaucratic and fairly undemocratic political elite from the centre. They killed most genuine worker-democracy very early on in the process, shortly after the revolution, and most of the libertarian-inclined socialists were quick to point this out very loudly, often on pain of death or banishment/exile.

Its interesting to consider his long term future. originally I felt the same as you. But now i'm starting to feel some hope that we can keep him. If one of those 3 teams don't come calling this summer, then the chances of him staying increase a lot given his age and (hopefully) our ever-growing success. Would love to see suarez retire here.

edit: I don't think Bayern would call given their talent. Barca might call, but that just seems likea weird fit. I doubt they have serious interest in him. Really the only team I'm worried about is Real Madrid. They need a striker and Luis is one of the best. Right now i feel like there is a 65% chance they will make a bid of 45+this summer.

1. Of the 106 missing episodes, no more than 75 are realistically recoverable from anywhere in Africa

2. If by some miracle, all 75 of those episodes were to be found in the one place, that place would be Zambia. 

3. It's possible that the wild claims of 90 or more episodes recovered could be true, but only if the stash also included large numbers of episodes that the BBC already holds in its archives. 

4. The claim that these episodes come from Ethiopia and the claim that they include Troughton stories are incompatible. Pick one.

5. If they do come from Ethiopia, they might complete seasons 1 and 2; Ethiopia was the last place on earth known to have transmitted these stories.

6. My *guess* -- a trove of Troughton material has turned up in Nigeria that includes a big chunk of season 5; some of which the BBC already has, much of which it doesn't. (But I still hope it's 75 missing episodes from Zambia...) ;)

Defense:

His defensive positioning and workrate have improved. He still needs to work on his workrate though, because it was shite to begin with. Right now its an acceptable amount for a RW. 

Physical:

Some people will say that his strength has improved, I don't really see it. he's always been good at holding defenders off. what HAS improved noticeably is his speed. His acceleration and top speed are faster. Its either this or la liga players are just slower..I think he's gotten faster. This is an important improvement. 

Decision making:
Its improved...but he's still a kid and it shows. He's gotten better, but there are still moments when his decision making is questionable. noticeable improvement though. 

He has the tendency to go missing for a bit. Only when fullbacks wise up and man mark him. thats not really his fault though. When he gets the ball he usually comes right back into it. He's an important player for Almeria and you can tell he has the trust of his teammates. He's the perfect outlet player whether he drifts wide or when central. you can almost always count on him to recieve the ball, keep the ball and make a pass that will keep possession.

He makes our team twice as good, and if we do sell him, we will not get someone as good as him, even if RM/Bayern or another big club pays $60mil for him (using that figure as a guess, I'm aware he's worth Bale money).

true,Ahesterd,null,null,"Honestly, I'm not crazy about either one of them as showrunners. Moffat has produced some absolutely great individual episodes, and I was excited for him to take over, but by the end of Season 5 I was very let down. All of Moffat's finales have been lacking - he seems to spend all of his time building up some grand complicated scheme and trying to make you go ""LOOK! LOOK HOW CLEVER I AM!"" when he actually lacks even an ounce of subtlety. His grand resolutions rarely ever resolve anything other than the immediate under-our-nose situation - like the TARDIS exploding in Season 5. Okay, he ""rebooted"" the universe (which is it's own special brand of bullshit), but never bothered to ask *why* the TARDIS was exploding. We're left to infer that the Silence made it explode - okay. *How*? Also, *why*? Didn't they want to kill him so that he wouldn't destroy the universe or some such? Good job, guys; your attempts to kill him were going to destroy the universe anyways. Nevermind how they got that covenant of Doctor's Enemies at the end of the season to actually work together - it's well-established that Daleks won't work with Cybermen, or, y'know, anybody else. Sometimes not even other Daleks. This kind of bullshit kept up for each succeeding overarching plot. Sure, I get that they're supposed to be fairly interlinked, but... I mean, they aren't, though. We'd still be wondering about cracks in the universe if they were. 

Davies, on the other hand, also had some pretty sick individual episodes (Midnight, represent!) though I'd say not as many. As someone else mentioned, he relied *way* too much on Deus ex Machina to get the Doctor out of jams in his overarching storylines. About to be killed by Daleks? It's okay, Rose is now omnipotent. Cybermen and Daleks about to overrun the Earth while warring with each other? Magic vacuum! (Granted, this one is actually all right, since it had been set up at least a bit, though still makes me a bit twingey) Aged to be fucking Gollum and locked in a cage while the Master controls the Earth? The people of Earth fucking *wish really hard* and the Doctor suddenly gets magic powers and he magically reverts everything back to normal. Daleks about to erase reality? It's okay, Donna can *type really fast!*. The End of Time was just a thrill ride of buffoonery from beginning to end... all of this, and not to mention that Davies just couldn't fucking let Rose go. Seriously, the five minutes in Season 4 when her ghost wasn't looming over the series was *great*. 

I consider the height of the show to be seasons 3-5 as far as individual episodes go. Ten was at his best there, playing off some very well-written episodes, and the chemistry between Eleven, Amy, and Rory in Season 5 was great, until Moffat decided to turn Amy into a Mary Sue only to be rivaled by River Song. Also, Donna. Hands down the best companion - she wasn't on some power trip like Amy ended up being, she wasn't head-over-heels in love with the Doctor like Rose and Martha, and she actually stood up for what she thought was right, even if the Doctor didn't see it that way. 

As the show went on, it really started to feel like fanfiction. And that's because in a way it is - Davies and Moffat were both fans long before they were on the show. Season 5 with Moffat delved away from that Fanfiction-y feel, but then he dove right back into it as he went mad with power.

I'm not suggesting that I don't believe it's true that Suarez would go to Madrid, but it's the way you sell the idea, ""he wants to get to the top"". 
You say ""you be the judge of where a South American superstar would rather play"" considering ""RM is still RM and LFC is still LFC"".  

To be perfectly honest I don't think a South American superstar wants to be at Madrid because of history, they want to be there because Madrid will give them massive wages &amp; they'd be living in Madrid with much better climate.   In terms of history, I'd imagine if Real Madrid suddenly had cash problems they'd also have problems holding onto players.   

What really annoys me is people saying RM is RM, because imo RM are probably the most disgusting cancer to the game ever.   There's no point even counting the first 5 European Cups they 'won' because of the obvious shenanigans going on in the 50's. Then you're basically left with  a sh*tty club with a disgusting history &amp; shi**y ethics. They are a big part to play in the ruining of football at the moment. 

Any player that is logical and doesn't have money as number 1 priority would want to avoid Real when there are plenty of successful clubs that run a better ship. 

I think it's hilarious when people say ""play for the white shirt"" as if it means something big in football, all it means is that you're a sell-out playing for a club with a terrible history. Real keep trying to sell this idea ""playing for the white shirt"" and it's ludicrous that people fall for it.   I'm delighted that LFC is still LFC and I'm remember not too long ago when LFC annihilated RM.

I was talking about the reverse actually. Ever heard of Megabus? Competition for rail services right there (I've certainly chosen them over trains before and will again).

[This is an excellent video on price gouging by the way, and the good it can do.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9QEkw6_O6w&amp;noredirect=1)

The example isn't perfect (as it deals with a natural disaster) but the underlying mechanism still holds true.

Again, I'm not convinced railways are a natural monopoly (even excluding other forms of transport), so I don't see why normal competition could not solve the problems we face.

Remember: as the population increases, the number of rail passengers will increase. Eventually, the existing rail lines will reach max capacity and new ones will need to be build anyway. There is not reason why a competing rail line could not be build to take up the higher demand.

This is coupled with the rise of the idea that houses are investments rather than homes. With house prices rising way above inflation, the investor class were well-aware of the gains to be made by shoving spare cash into property. All this additional money in the mix only serves to push prices higher.

As an aside that’s one reason why property prices in desirable areas never really stopped rising even through the crisis: when there’s a recession property is still seen as a safe investment until the economy recovers – and for the rich, who still have money to invest, why would you put it into anything but the nice areas? It’s a bit like first-class passengers loading their suitcases in an overturned bus, standing around idly waiting for everyone else to get the thing moving again.

Anyway, going back to house prices and mortgages. The whole thing is effectively a slight-of-hand trick that at first was about home owners making a quick buck by driving up prices, but now has become about making sure the most recent entrants to the decades-long pyramid scheme just don’t lose money. And the only way to do this is to rope in another generation of suckers. And then another. And then another. So that no one has to look down and realise they walked off the cliff half a mile ago.

The trouble is this cannot go on forever, so today we’re seeing the final desperate throes of what was effectively a giant decades-long binge, before the hangover sets in.

All three major players mentioned above (home owners, banks and the investor class) benefit from artificially high house prices.

Those who already have houses like to see the value of their asset sky-rocket above inflation, because they get to sit back and enjoy a money-shitting pile of bricks without having to lift a finger. They feel very clever and smug about this; they also vote in droves so you’ll never see any government willing to allow a fall in house prices to correct the market.

The banks enjoy stupidly rising house prices because any risk that the bank is exposed to from defaults of mortgages basically disappears - if you've lent someone £100,000 to buy a house worth £120,000, and then over 5 years this house suddenly becomes worth £200,000, your money is pretty damn safe. If the market were allowed to correct itself by lowering house prices then the banks would be exposed to great losses – this another reason why you’ll never see any government willing to allow a fall in house prices to correct the market. 

The investor class also tend to invest in politicians, and so there's the third reason you'll never see any government willing to allow a fall in house prices to correct the market.

And that’s where the 5% government-backed mortgage comes in. The government will do anything it can to sustain this dying scheme: today's tactic is to enable young people to take on an astronomical level of debt, backed by the treasury. When the music stops (and it will stop), you'll be the ones who bought when prices were still around-about their highest, and since you're only putting 5% down, you're also saddled with the most debt.",0,1381137398,null,0,1381147187,0,ccmo1de,t3_1nq1tx,t1_ccmo1de,t1_cclgk3t,null,1429217489,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It might also be worth taking an internal flight if you're want to make the most of your time. I don't know how close the airport in Edinburgh is to the centre of the city, but its super easy to get to any London airport with the public transport system in London. Using skyscanner and putting in a random date around new year, it looks like you could get a return flight for £66 per adult. It won't be that comfortable, but when the flight is only 1hr15, I don't think it will matter. As transitiverelation has pointed out, you'll want to make the most of the limited daylight. 

Personally I would go for a flight, not only because its the quickest way, but because at least you're guaranteed to get a seat, something that you may not get on the train if you don't book an advance ticket. Often with Flexible train tickets, they offer you a way to get from A to B, but not a seat for the journey.

true,northerncal,lfc68,,"Hm. Wonder who the options could be to replace him. Mario Gomez? Probably could be interested if we finish top three or four at least and Fiorentina's season does not go too well (currently 6th and out of Europe) but might be too slow for how Liverpool want to play? Not particularly creative but as shown at bayern and Germany he can work well with a strike partner and would be a deadly poacher if fed through the middle by coutinho. Is 28. 

Balotelli? I know this sounds crazy but Milan are not doing well (12th!) and has already switched clubs multiple times so may be open to moving as he's still young. Possibly could form a deadly young and clinical partnership with Sturridge and coutinho or could be crazy, constantly rebeling and not be successful. 

Benzema could fit the formation to some degree, but may be too similar to Sturridge? He's fast and powerful but not too creative and he never seemed to work well with a strike partner at Madrid with Higuain. 


Ronaldo? This won't happen ever but he would fit so well into our desired style of play (and is obviously one of the better players ever) so I'm going to pretend it will. 

Marco Reus? This obviously won't happen either, at least for 3 or so years anyway but he would also destroy pl teams too with us so imagine if he decides to move on from dortmund in a couple years, when Suarez just went to Madrid and we finished 2 or something in league? Sounds fine to me. 

He's partly a striker, mostly a winger, but Alan Dzagoev is someone else who I've recently realized would be really good for us here and we wouldn't even need to wait til Suarez leaves necessarily, he'd cost about around 25 million but if we can afford it and he could be convinced I rate him as a solution to our width problems. Only 23 and already leading a very good Russian team, he's a winger who creates but also scores, something we could desperately use. I'd guess he blows up in the transfer market next summer if he shows well in the world cup (like manzukic at last euros) so if we could knick him come January we could potentially look quite smart next year as like coutinho or Sturridge.

Every time the opponent gets a chance, it seems like its because our central midfielders give them space or they use to much time getting back. 
Ramires is a deadly weapon offensively. His runs create space and disrupt defences in established attacks. He is also so fast that he can easily initiate a counter by himself. 
BUT! He sometimes spends too much time getting back and holds too much off when he defends. I know hes been playing in an offensive position almost all of his career, but still. It was clear in the Tottenham match that when he gets told to mark a player or hold back, he fucking destroys them. Eriksen was probably MOM of the 1st half. Second? A ghost. All thanks to Ramires and Joses instructions. 

Yesterday he seemed to have gotten a more free role. He was great, don't get me wrong, but when he plays in a pivot with Lamps it leaves too much space. Lampard is slow, old and NOT a defensive player. Ramires can be. And he can be extremely great at it. But now, that partnership creates more problems than it stops, I feel.

So moving forward I would rather see Rami with Mikel(allthough he leaves space just because he's simply too slow), or when Rami and Lamps play together Rami takes a defensive approach. Another option would be using Essien, as he is perfect(and looked good against Swindon), but I have really no idea about his form(I mean... Swindon).

The best way to do it if you are not worried about time I would say is:

* Get your CBT done.  

* Get at least a few months on a 125 and learn the basics.  This will make you a safer and better rider all round.  I have found that riding a 125 you have to stretch every last bit out of the gears so this is good practice and translates well when you are riding a bigger bike.  (Please note you can't ride on a motorway with a CBT and it is not recommended to with a 125.)

* Get your Theory test out of the way while you are doing this.

* Once you have done this do your A2 in stages, do some rider training with a good school and then book your mod 1.  Do some more training and then book your mod 2.  Don't put too much pressure on yourself.  You are learning to be safe not to just get your license as quickly as possible.

This will give you the best all round experience.  Some people just jump straight into a 5/6 day intensive course which squeezes in CBT, theory, mod 1 and mod 2 so the training is all around this.  In my opinion I don't see how someone that has done this could possibly have the experience to be a good rider and handle a bigger bike very safely this way.

The route I took was to ride a 125 for a year and a half, got my theory test done and then went for my full A license in a 3 day course.  2 of these days were taken up by the mod1/mod2 tests mostly.  The training was easy as it didn't take much for the transition from small to big bike after having this experience.

I understand your point, and normally I'm completely on the ""victimless crime"" bandwagon...  but this is so far from being a victimless crime.  This is absolutely a time when jail is justified.

14 year old girls can't consent to marriage.  They can't consent to a mobile phone contract, for goodness sake, let alone marriage.  Therefore they are being coerced, either mentally or physically, which is an act of violence.

Now, on the wedding night.  Do you think these 14 year olds are given a teddy bear, a story and a cup of horlicks or do you think they are forced to ""consummate"" the marriage?  Do you think that forcibly consummating (or raping as we might legitimately call it) is non-violent?

&gt; whilst banning them from a position of legitimacy

That's a minimum, surely?

EDIT

Also this get my goat...

&gt; One Cabinet minister dismissed the fears, telling The Daily Telegraph that if the shares were oversubscribed it was “a triumph”. The source said: “Labour have nowhere to go. Not only did they fail to privatise it, as they succumbed to union paymaster pressure, they left Royal Mail in a weak state.

Maybe they realise it was political suicide to sell off a public Asset that the public do not want sold?

&gt;“Their amendments during the Bill would have reduced its value and made it more difficult to sell.

What amendments? Typical Politico BS of 'Well something they wanted to do may have meant I got less money doing it my way..'

&gt;“Labour are inconsistent and incoherent on Royal Mail: the only thing we know about Labour’s policy is that it led to post offices closing in their thousands.”

Erm Post Office and Royal Mail are two wholly separate entities... Blaming PO closure on RM is pointless and is like blaming Eddie Stobart for declining sales in Tesco Stores (ES do the Haulage for Tesco Stores)

&gt;A Business Department spokesman said: “The Government is approaching the sale as a commercial shareholder and is seeking fair value for the shares and the best deal for taxpayers.

Like hell you are, no Commercial Shareholder would sell shares at such a devalued level...

&gt;“This is a commercial transaction and government is following normal commercial practice in setting and publicising the share price and delivering value for the taxpayer.

&gt;“Final valuation will be determined by institutional investors through the book-building process, based on their assessment of Royal Mail, its strengths and potential for growth and returns.

&gt;“The value of Royal Mail will depend on a number of factors, notably the company’s ongoing financial performance, its future prospects and the level of investor interest. The Government will hold on to a stake in the business which could be sold at a future date.

'Sold at a Future Date' you mean once you jack the shares up, sell what you have, cause a massive stock crash, buy them all back cheap and hope you make a profit at the end?

Can operate as a winger on either side or even play in the middle (and has done all already for cska this season) so he seems to have the interchangeability Rodgers desires of his forwards. Looks like he could be a long term answer to our problems on the wing and creates and orchestrates attacks as well as scoring himself, something we could desperately use out wide. I think with him, coutinho, Sturridge and even Suarez if we got him this January or Suarez staid an extra year our offense could go from good to Great, and really be competitive in the Champions League going forwards. 

Transfermarkt estimates him at 25 million which if we could buy him for around that would represent good value, and while not cheap, really be worth it in my opinion. 

Whether or not he would want to join is another question but if we are first or second come January, he may be interested in playing in England.

Gomez is great but again he only just moved to Fiorentina so I doubt he'd move again so soon. Dzagoev would be a decent signing but I think he'll result in us going back to a 4-3-2-1, maybe with Yarmolenko or Konoplyanka on the other wing. 

I think if we sell Suarez we should look for two inverted wingers to replace him since there seems to be an abundance of those compared to players like Suarez. I wouldn't mind taking a punt on Carlos Vela either as he's definitely matured since leaving Arsenal and looks quite a good player. 

I would really like to see us go back in for Diego Costa too, he's a great player and one of the closest replacements (for the position) of Suarez out there. His tenacity and strength will be a handful for any defence and his hold up play will allow Sturridge so much space. 

Maybe Jovetic if he doesn't work out at City? Seems rather low down on the pecking order and maybe he'd leave for us after a year? Even so it would appear that he's quite injury prone and that worries me. 

Truthfully we're not going to get a player as good as Suarez, he's just so good and there's no one who compares to him in the world. 

Tevez is a similar player but his attitude is appalling and Suarez's desire to win at all costs is an element of his game that makes him so good.

In terms of learning English, asylum seekers aren't allowed to register with colleges and can't afford private tutelage. They rely on charity run ESOL classes which are oversubscribed. Its not a case of not wanting to learn, its a case of how. In terms of integration, a lot of refugees do want to do this, but with agressive attitudes coming from the media and the general public coupled with extreme shyness due to their experiences, you can surely understand why they often retreat into minority communities.

&gt;We generally expose ourselves to news sources that we agree with and confirm our world view. So I read the Guardian rather than the Sun or Daily Mail for example.

This would be true if everyone still paid for/ selected their newspapers. in London, the Metro and Standard are free, which means that a lot of people read them simply because they're there. And most of the tabloid websites are free but hook readers in a completely different manner to their published versions (prime example; Daily Mail - I noticed you mention this below, but I still feel the outcome is that these organs always seem to end up believing their own press and subsequent importance).

&gt;To do this it understands its readership and targets its content towards 

I'd suggest that this is also out of date - most newspapers understand that their readership is dwindling and will never return, which has prompted more and more dodgy behaviour in increasingly desperate bids to reverse that trend. And that's before we get to the likes of the News of the World/ The Sun, who are quite happy to pretend that they win elections for governments (when they're not defending themselves by insisting they have no influence whatsoever).

&gt;and are therefore highly unlikely to print anything that would stand against their readerships core belief systems.

By not accepting the complex problem, we can't help to change it.

Same with teenage pregnancies say: the reason its higher than other countries is probably due to complex factors, but the 'man on the street' would probably say its because our teenagers are a little bit slaggy.

We have actually fixed problems like this before: look at British cycling. We used to be nowhere, and people would say 'well, we're a little country, don't have that many good cyclists'. Within a generation we are the elite cycling country in the world, because rather than look at individuals and think that each person failing to be good was the problem, they changed the system of training and the culture of adequacy to one where our athletes are hyper-competitive and obsessed with winning.

Why are people from lower backgrounds in other countries able to embrace the opportunity to rise, whereas in the UK we don't? Could be as you said, the collective failures of parents, or it could be that the cultures and systems in this country somehow don't encourage aspiration, entrepreneurship and ambition - at least not for the working classes. 

You can see this borne out by anyone who is a JSA claimant - they're *actively told* not to hold out for the dream job but instead 'stop claiming benefits and get any job'.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"This one hurt for a myriad of reasons, i think there is a lot of overreaction going on to the loss but there are also valid concerns.

I agree with your points but there are parts of the performance yesterday that are valid concerns. I agree that we can forget the score, once WH scored we were leaving things open to get stung again and WH took advantage.  Set pieces we have been poor with (taking advantage of them as well as defending them) so far this season. Managers having less control isn't as cut and dry as you make it out to be but is still a valid point.

To me the biggest frustration to yesterday was how we had been changing the past couple seasons.  In the past I would have expected this game to occur, not because we didn't have talent...but because we always have a few matches like this during the season. We always have the match where the attack looks stumped, the match where the defense looks like they had never met before, or the match where people look disinterested.  Every year we have these matches, and every year it is infuriating.

But we seemed to be moving away from these occurrences, we have numerous options in attack so we shouldn't become stumped, our defense has been fantastic, especially late in matches since last year and the team always seems driven. But yesterday...yesterday we looked like the ""Good ole Spurs"", something i had hoped we had moved away from.

We have been changing rapidly as a team in the past few months and we are still clearly in transition.  In attack we aren't playing as the ""swashbuckling"" attacking team, we are deliberate and possession based and so far this season we have struggled to take advantage of the chances we create.  To me it honestly looks like the players are still very much ""on the leash"" with AVB, the players look like they aren't being as creative and flowing but are trying to stay within the system and not stray from within the team framework.  This is fine, especially when the players are still learning from AVB and about each other, but it makes our attack sluggish.

Yesterday our attack looked completely and utterly stumped as to what to do.  I don't think Sam was a genius in not playing a striker, but i think he drilled him team to do what they did...sit back, favor the right, clog the middle and make Spurs beat WH on the left. It wasn't rocket science, but it worked, we looked completely stumped.  We could have tried flipping the wingers, we could have subbed on a winger at half time, we could have Naughts to the right and pulled Walker (who was half-fit and looked it) off the pitch.  We could have tried a number of things, but didn't seem to try any of them and that does fall on management.

Yesterday wasn't the end of the world, and i think there is a lot of overreaction, we have a very good squad capable of some very impressive football.  But for me, yesterday was the first time in a while that we looked like ""good ole Spurs"", As a squad we looked like shit...they looked drained (Europa plays into this), they looked uninspired, they looked sluggish and they looked tactically stumped. On top of all of that, we seemed at a complete loss of how to overcome any one part of the issues let alone all of them together.",0,1381147973,null,0,false,0,ccmpcdc,t3_1nw54p,t1_ccmpcdc,t3_1nw54p,null,1429216879,6,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,6

Secondly, the Royal Mail made profits of £402 million this year.

Even our poor have it good in comparison. The attitude to education is appalling in the UK in my experience. Working in India shows the gulf in attitude, the kids study hard every evening and go to school on Saturdays so that they don't have to live in a dusty shed any more.

Perhaps poor people in the UK have it too good. What about in richer countries though? Sweden, Finland, Norway, Germany, Canada, Denmark all have better social mobility. India is an interesting example because it has particularly **bad** social mobility. As hard as the kids might try to study, it's still likely that unless they are from a wealthy background they will remain in the same social strata they were born in.

&gt;We just threw money at that. Firstly from the lottery which helped us a bit and then as we got better we got more money.

I suppose that becomes a chicken and egg argument. Anything with more resources does better generally.

I've not understood why all those who yearn for socialism haven't gotten themselves a joint bank account and started saving together?

Why have those millions who want the 70s back not saved a pound a week for forty years and bought themselves a manufacturing plant?

The answer is that the free market and the price mechanism is the greatest force for human cooperation that has ever been seen.
