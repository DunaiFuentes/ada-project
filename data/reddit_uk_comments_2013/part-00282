American managers tend to stay in charge far longer than European football managers as a result, as the success of the team does not fall entirely on their shoulders.

I think the habit of teams bringing in a manager, giving him free reign over transfers, the manager not succeeding quickly enough, sacking the manager, then having to start all over is far more detrimental than saying to a manager, ""here are the players you have to work with"".  The manager should know that this is the case when they accept the job.

He's just being honest that he's not particularly good at playing the social games that come with playing the part. Office politics isn't his ""thing"" really. I can get that.

* Joe Hart was, in my opinion, quite phenomenal; dominated his area made great saves and positioned himself very well. 

However

* The one thing i felt though in this match, was that Nasri was a bit too greedy today, it's great he's got his confidence back and is raring to get on the score sheet but there was 4-5 times where he could've passed and opened someone up on goal but decided to take a shot which either was blocked or went wide.",0,1388116039,null,0,1388116240,0,ceax37l,t3_1tr55c,t1_ceax37l,t3_1tr55c,null,1427973497,2,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,2

There have been no prosecutions or rulings of the equalities act in this context, as actually the law was that  discrimination based on personal relationships was valid and it still remains the case in practice.

Your argument makes "" female wanted"" equally illegal. which is still present and valid and commonly used.

Laws only work based on application. You can still discriminate and deny service if you have a personal stake in the relationship such as in this  context.  You run a risk of possibly being the first person ever to be penalised, by some legal eagle, but you have a much greater chance of not being penalised or prosecuted. Because the law in this resolution is needlessly pedantic and unjust. 

Laws are not unequivocal formulae, they require interpretation and judgement.

If they want to play with two strikers and an attacking mid in behind they would need to send out something like today, Siggy and Holtby/Chadli to play as center mids who stay narrow in and out of possession to flank a defensive mid and leave the flanks entirely to Rose and Walker.

If they played Lennon and Townsend behind Eriksen and flanking, say Sandro, it wouldn't work, they're not natural center of the park players, Townsend especially.

Also, the original timeline's Trensalor (sp?) had a monument for River, but as far as we know River was never part of those battles.  Or was she?

I don't know how the priest lady could be River.  The timeline for River's life doesn't seem to have room for this incarnation.  But hey, it's a time travel show.  Stranger things have happened.

The dialog you're referring to goes likes this:

(Doctor and Tash going back and forth about the church, the Kovarian and the cracks) 

Doctor: *The Destiny Trap. You can't change history if you're a part of it.*

Tash: *They engineered a psychopath to kill you.*

D: *Totally married her. I'd never make it here alive without River Song.*

T: *I'm not interested in changing history Doctor. I want to change the future. The Daleks send for reinforcements daily. They are massing for war...* (more unimportant details)...

The next part you're referring to is:

(Clara is brave and tells the Daleks to go ahead because she's not afraid)

Doctor: *That's what I'm talking about. That is a woman! I always knew you were a bit spineless. You and your pointless church. Why did I ever rely on you? Never trust a nun to do a doctor's work.* (she snaps and slaps him)

The Doctor calling River spineless would be very out of character and he distinctly refers to River as a different person. I know she is a popular character and people are hungry to tie up loose ends but remember that River Song may be a psychopath but not all psychopaths are River Song. 

Edit: There is a second train of thought that she helped raise River, which I think makes an equally big plot hole.

Also, Siggy knows how to make a dummy run quite well, although not that he looked great today. So I think, had Christian taken more positional risks, especially once Tim put out Bentaleb to give him a little more freedom, he would have been granted the opportunity to thread through the strikers.

When we play teams like West Brom, players need to trust the back line and their fellow midfield partner and take the risks, float into spaces to unlock the strikers. Obviously, Holtby has the quality to play a good ball to Eriksen, yet Christian was constantly trying to give Lewis brohugs while they were on the ball.

I am not blaming Christian. He was wary of his duties defensively. But, Tim should have told him to (or he could have done so himself) take more risks.

You brought up risks yourself. To be fair, CMs are the ones who can take the biggest gambles. If Lewis is on the ball just in front of the center circle, the only real non side to side options are difficult balls to the strikers/wingers, or if its an option, a ball to the other CM who is darting into the spaces to disrupt the halfbacks and let the strikers move around more, get some controlled chaos going.",0,1388119034,null,0,false,0,ceay3bw,t3_1tqtgx,t1_ceay3bw,t1_ceam1rq,null,1427973029,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

Holtby has shown some and I mean like one or two glimpses in one or two games, of being a number 10. That's it, otherwise he's a high energy, all purpose, box to box midfielder. He is not a traditional controlling midfielder who will simply recycle possession and intercept passes, nor a destoyer and certainly not a deep lying playmaker.

He's not a specialist, which is fine, but in a two or three man midfield he needs to be fielded with a defensively minded player and ideally a true number 10.

true,dsruix,tennant,Tennant,"My problems with Moffat stem from 2 very related things. He has great story ideas, but they are too often squashed into too short a timespan. There's no ebb and flow to the episodes because it's all bing bang boom to the end. This leaves plotholes, inconsistencies, but most tragic, it leaves out real character development.

Matt Smith does an admirable job, but I felt he was severely handicapped because his development as a character was never written in. In fact, I would go so far as to say that most of 11's growth has been entirely created by the way Matt has portrayed his character. In the writing however, all the character development is situational, as in it's there because it's needed to move the story forward, quickly moved past, as in the doctor often reverts to a state before that change, and, worst of all, told to the audience straight. 

The writing doesn't show his growth and that is a major problem. The writing never showed that 11 was the man who forgets, it told us that. The writing never showed that he became the man who remembers, again it told us so (in fact, even contradicts itself as it doesn't even acknowledge the biggest lie told to Clara yet, something a man who remembers would have at least mentioned). Contrast this with 10 whose development spanned his seasons and we were shown his softening heart and his acceptance of the good he has done. We didn't need to be told he was the man who regrets in the anniversary special because we knew that from how he was written. It made sense for 10 and the way he reacted to every adventure because he was the feeling doctor. He felt everything and that was shown to us, not told. 

Worse is the relationship with 11s companions. We keep being told how important Amy is to 11, but it never is really shown, especially considering that his mourning of her departure is honestly only fueled by the need to introduce Clara, followed by a quick and complete removal of any trace of Amy from the doctor's life, until the end when she suddenly appears. He doesn't grow to remember her, he just suddenly does. We keep being told how close Clara and the doctor are, but there isn't that deep a connection there either. It's not like Rose or Donna where the great feeling of companionship is there, it really is just sidekick who is there when she's needed and not when she's not. So much for someone so impossibly important to him. Not to mention how exceedingly bland she is.

Yet when we look at what brought us to this point I note the distinct decision not to have multi episode stories and stick with single Hollywood headliner episodes. It wasn't so bad with the pond era when those were still a thing, but I think it really is felt with the Clara arc.

The extra time gives him ample time to introduce the characters, set it up, develop the characters and give a satisfying finish. Imagine if those were cut to fit a 1 hour time block. I'm sure the complaints would seem like deja vu.

I also suspect he might suffer from Lucasitis. He comes up with great ideas that really resonate with people but if given too much creative control, budget and not enough people challenging him, they collapse under their own weight. His debut season was probably the best from start to finish and that's where his leash was the shortest. He still took risks, but they were very calculated and measured.

3. Show monster again and expect the momentum of the previous encounter to carry over without taking the same measures as before to keep us in suspense

The hallucination was a nice touch, but if the only time I ever really believed they clicked was a hallucination at the end of his life, it really casts a poor light on the rest of their time together. 

EDIT: Should also mention that their chat in ""The Power of Three"" was well done, and the Doctor saying goodbye to Amy in ""The God Complex"" was one of the most powerful moments of Series 6. But I'm really struggling to remember more times it seemed that the Doctor and Amy worked well together naturally.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but their bodies had to have died. 

&gt;But what about everyone else who is stored in the library archives? Namely HAL. That is a lot of consciousness in one body

Wasn't it CAL? Anyway, I theorize in that last paragraph that perhaps she's some sort of amalgamation of the multiple consciousnesses of the library, led/dominated by River's. I can think of plenty of reasons for why it would be her, and not CAL--CAL has the mind of a little girl, and perhaps wouldn't desire to leave the Library.

&gt;I really don't think they were calling back to River Song. They wrapped her up nicely, why introduce a whole new angle with her in a new body and alive again?

Why not?

&gt;Plus, if it was River, she is still a Time Lord. The Doctor has the ability to recognise other Time Lords, no matter what form they are in

Er, clearly the Doctor knows that's River, if it is her. Much of the evidence is based on how he behaves towards her. Also, others have already theorized an artificial body. If it is, that's definitely not a Time Lady's body. And the Doctor has been proven in the past not to be able to immediately recognize Time Lords with some amount of masking involved--like the Master.

&gt;like you're suggesting happened with River, why bother uploading the little girl to the library in the first place? 

Because they couldn't do that at the time? 

&gt;And to an even further extent, why didn't the Doctor do it for River?

The Vashta Nerada, because he didn't know how, because he was afraid to confront River's 'ghost'...

I'm not saying that it's definitely, 100% her, but I'm saying that there are signs, and there's only one piece of outstanding evidence that it's not.",0,1388128416,null,0,false,0,ceb0x2i,t3_1toyc9,t1_ceb0x2i,t1_ceaq2wx,null,1427971711,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

&gt; Ah, now, stay where you are. Because look at me, I'm confident. You want to watch that, me, when I'm confident. 

And even plays around with them:

&gt;Or maybe you could just listen a minute, because all I really want to do is accept your total surrender, and then I'll let you go in peace. You've been interfering in human history for thousands of years. People have suffered and died. But what's the point in two hearts, if you can't be a bit forgiving now and then. Ooh! The Silence. You guys take that seriously, don't you? OK, you got me, I'm lying. I'm not really going to let you go that easily. Nice thought, but it's not Christmas. 

And then builds up to the most epic blow:

&gt; Guys, sorry. But you're way out of time. Now, come on, a bit of history for you. Aren't you proud, because you helped? (pulls out the TV antennae) Do you know how many people are watching this live on the telly? Half a billion, and that's nothing, because the human race will spread out among the stars, you just watch them fly. Billions and billions of them, for billions and billions of years. And every single one of them, at some point in their lives, will look back at this man, taking that very first step, and they will never, ever forget it. Oh. But they'll forget this bit.

And then it dawns on everyone what just happened:

I feel like Moffat was probably so busy with the 50th anniversary and the Christmas special and Sherlock that he didn't put too much effort into the season itself. Name, Day, and Time were brilliant, and so were Asylum, Snowmen, and Journey, but the rest of it was pretty much filler. 

A few reasons that next season will probably be better. New doctor. No big anniversary. No Sherlock. Plenty of time before airing. (and supposedly Moffat has had story ideas for S8 for over a year now) 

I do hope Moffat brings back the two parter episodes, at least for the finale. Two parters were always the best and it was disappointing when he decided to stop making them. It feels like he wants the show to be more procedural, meaning you don't have to have seen anything to enjoy it.

true,M0dusPwnens,null,null,"I will say that I vastly prefer Moffat mostly because his arcs actually have to do with the characters in a more substantial way and he's *much* less reluctant to really leverage the TARDIS.

In terms of the former, he's been more willing to build on the mythology of the character and the Time Lords - from the Doctor's wife to confronting his mortality. I actually think this is a large part of why I (and I realize I'm in the minority here) like Smith's Doctor the best - Moffat took an actor who was arguably too young for the role and used that to bring the Doctor's actual age into much more stark focus by contrasting his youthful appearance and mannerisms with the more weary aspects of being hundreds and hundreds of years old and having lost so much.

The Pandorica episodes are among my favorites for the latter reason: the plot actually makes use of the fact that they have a time-travel device. Similarly, I love that he actually looked at things like the idea of the Doctor popping off and coming back, but actually have been gone soul-searching/running away for hundreds of years. Or the heartbreaking brilliance of the out-of-order stuff with River.

There's also, I think, something to be said for his attention to detail. Over and over, he's closed up seeming plot holes in a pretty satisfactory way. He tends to make good on his promises and tie up loose ends even when you think he's forgotten about them. A lot of people thought he was just going to ignore the regeneration thing for instance, but he was just as worried about the continuity there as we were. And same with tying up the creation of the Silence in this last episode.

A lot of people seem to dislike him for how he's changed the show, but I really thought of it as a *deepening* of the show - he sets things up in a way that you get to really explore some of the fundamental aspects of the premise. I can see how people might not be into that though - some people want to see a show about magicians, but many others just want to see the magic itself.",0,1388132868,null,0,false,0,ceb1vab,t3_1tqzx8,t1_ceb1vab,t1_ceb04is,null,1427971267,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

Check credit rating on Noddle. If you're applying for a credit card, it's a good idea to know what cards you're likely to be accepted for. 

One idea is get an interest free credit card (hopefully with a large enough spending limit to pay for annual car insurance) and put the car insurance on that then pay it back bit by bit before the 0% interest expires. 

That will also save you from having to take money out of your ISA. 

Whilst cash ISAs pay crap atm, it's probably the best place to start. Aim to keep £1000 in current account and avoid taking money out of the cash ISA, it should be your last resort money. 

Avoid S&amp;S ISA till you have built up a emergency fund and have enough cash in safer options to make the risk less risky.

I'm already at risk of belaboring the point so I'll continue.

Where I live fox would be trapped and dispatched with a .22 rimfire, single shot to the head to preserve the fur.

Some hunters call fox at night with distressed rabbit calls.  Again, most will try to preserve the pelt and so would try to hit the head.

I grew up hunting squirrels, which in my region are quite large and good to eat, and I usually went for a head shot with a .22.  I have taken hundreds of squirrels and I've never had one run away.

I've definitely missed or winged a couple of rabbits with a shotgun.  These are 'jumped' out of brush and taken on the run.

4. Simon's would be able to tell if danger was coming

5. Curtis... Well he got the short end of the stick with the crappiest power...

Abbey no power

2. The Daleks aren't afraid of all Timelords, they're only afraid of one. Though I suppose your asking why they're only afraid of the Doctor when the other timelords are just as smart. I guess that's a testament of how clever the Doctor really is and how it sets him apart from the others.

true,mattjames092,null,null,"I'll attempt to answer these reasonably - 

1. I don't think regenerations are something the Time Lords like to just throw away, being that it's their entire personality at the time and stuff. Also I don't think you can just absorb the Heart of the Tardis whenever you want, it was a two-way thing. Exposure to the Heart also probably wouldnt have such a huge affect on a Time lord either, being that they're used to time energy and stuff.

2. The Daleks have been constantly knocked back by the Doctor for centuries. He's their greatest enemy, and going up against him has almost always resulted in their near-extinction. Also the Doctor stole the Tardis, not all Time Lords have the same access to one as he does.

3. Decent observation. I think it's because the angels didnt need the time energy at the time. They were more focused on killing people and stopping the re-entry of you-know-who from the place, then on feeding. They zap people back to absorb potential energy, and I just assumed they didn't need it at the time.

4. A fairly large plot hole to be honest. I think the explanation was something along the lines of their being too much time-distortion around that point in time, and Amy and Rory themselves for the Doctor to risk going back. Moffat said that to tamper with the timeline there would cause some sort of time explosion or whatever.

In all honesty, most of these are just things we aren't supposed to think about. I wouldn't call them plot holes, just oversights or things that aren't really intended to be big deals (with the exceptio of Amy and Rory which was so transparent my 14 yera old sister picked up on the hole - geez it was a sad moment but).

The implication here is that the rest of the country somehow isn't 'doing its bit' and that we should be thankful for London. But the thing is, while London may produce more money than the rest of the country, that is because it's sucking the rest of the country dry.

All the jobs go to London. All the talent goes to London. All the budget goes to London. Over £2k per person per year is spent on public transportation in London, compared to £5 per person per year for the entire north-east / north-west (can't quite remember which one right now).

It's all well and good saying 'Why don't we just build elsewhere?' but the fact is that the infrastructure and jobs aren't good enough, because London takes precedence over all, and that (because of the aforementioned reasons) nobody wants to live anywhere else.

All they need to do is stare into the heart of the Tardis and lose a generation, and they can wipe out all the Dalek's in the universe.

It might not be something you can easily replicate. You've also got too many apostrophes.

Why *aren't** Daleks afraid? Daleks rarely feel fear, and the Doctor was always the most adept one at getting rid of them. They don't necessary all use sonic screwdrivers though.

It is espoused often. Getting cash behind the ISA wire then moving it about is normal and April is the ISA ""season"" so it is the time to get good rates. 

By payments I presume you mean interest payments not deposits. 

Open any instant access cash ISA right now and you will get what ever interest you are owed when you transfer out (I have never seen a case where this was not true, but I maybe proved wrong). However make sure what ever cash ISA you are moving to in April will accept transfers. This bit is more tricky than transferring out.

true,sosr,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire in London,"Have you read what you wrote? 

&gt; if the landlord has a living arrangement with you so that you have shared living space etc, they are free to discriminate on any grounds they wish.

i.e. unambiguous and clear that discrimination is allowed.

What the article says:

&gt;There are three different groups who typically place flat adverts - landlords or agents letting a property, live-in landlords letting part of their property and tenants looking for housemates.

&gt;Dr Nuno Ferreira, an expert in discrimination law at the University of Manchester, believes that all these groups are covered.

&gt;""It doesn't make any difference if the landlord lives in the premises or not. This distinction will have a bearing on discrimination on other grounds, but not in relation to race or ethnicity."" The same applies to tenants looking for a housemate, he believes.

However:

&gt; housing law expert Daniel Fitzpatrick, associate solicitor at Hodge Jones &amp; Allen, argues it's ""ambiguous"". In general, housing legislation does not include live-in landlords and tenants, so it depends whether the Equality Act goes further, he says.

Therefore the article suggests that the law is ambiguous and unclear, which is the opposite of your opinion.

Then you said:

&gt; the equality law simply solidifies what was existent before ( you couldn't really discriminate a service based on these factors before 2010)

which doesn't make any sense. something existed before, but it didn't exist. The Equality Act 2010 replaced several previous acts, one of which was the Race Relations Act 1976, which also seemed to outlaw discrimination in these situations. 

&gt;You are allowed to exclude and select on any criteria you wish if you are sharing out a personal intimate area in your family home. If you don't live there, you cannot.

The 2010 act doesn't mention any exclusions based on what you describe there. That's why it's untested. ",0,1388149503,null,0,false,0,ceb49d0,t3_1trwkq,t1_ceb49d0,t1_ceb4255,null,1427970080,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I and the people around me *really* lose their shit.

I'm out of the house for 12 hours - 3 and a half of those hours are spent commuting, in some form or another.

When I first started, I couldn't understand what was wrong with people. They were rude, cold, didn't want to converse. They didn't make room for people on the trains, they wouldn't let old ladies sit down, they would bash people out of the way to make sure they could get on their train rather than chilling out and just getting the next one.

It was horrible - I would go home and tell my family about it, all the horrible ways people would treat each other. The weird silence of the train stations at 7:45 in the morning - over a hundred people stood, none of them talking to one another.

After a year of this shit, I am now one of those people. The train is late, I get crazy mad. That's *my* spare time. That's 15m of the 2h30m I have to myself when I finish work.

If I have to stay late to finish an ad cause someone's incompetent, I get incredibly angry. They go home. It's a 10 minute walk to their *house*. They can afford to live here - my ~~paycheck~~ monthly salary would barely cover rent, bills and food. But they get to leave on time, because making sure the ads get out isn't their job. Booking them is.

Commuting is really shitty.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"I think Vlad can be a a good player in the PL simply because his flaws are things that can be fixed with coaching.

When we bought him the consensus was that he would be the 4th CB for this season and the team would bring him along slowly and develop him. This was probably a unfair expectation given that EVERY season we have a rash of injuries at CB and end up playing people we don't expect to (Dawson was restored to the lineup and Caulker last year played quite a bit during our annual injury crisis, The year before we brought in Ryan Nelsen, the year before that Seb Bassong was restored to the lineup and Ćorluka played CB for us), we should have expected it to happen this season as well.  He was supposed to be learning behind Jan, Kaboul and Dawson this season, playing in EL and cup matches.  Instead we have pressed him into service.

Vlad is 24 years old, which in terms of a central defender is still young.  Jan was 25 and had been at Ajax playing in CL matches for 4 years when we brought him in, Vlad has been playing in Romania his whole career...not exactly the same coaching as Ajax. 

Now look around the league Cahill was 25 when he landed at Chelsea, Liverpool's CB's are 29 (Agger), 29(Škrtel), 32 (Toure) and 23 (Sahko), Man City's CB's are 27 (Kompany), 31 (Lescott), 33 (Demichelis) and 20 (Nastasić).  Defenders gain a better grasp of how to play their position and deal with attackers as they get older.  Vlad has a few seasons before we would really see him at his peak.

As for his performance, yesterday he was very poor.  He has been inconsistent, he has had some good matches and some howlers.  He is the type of player who is a gifted athlete with supreme confidence in his athletic ability, he takes risks where others wouldn't, on a ball that Dawson would hoof out of play Vlad tried to settle and make a play, he tries to jump passes, he gets too tight on players, he tries to bring the ball up the pitch, all things that were reinforced while playing lower talent in the Romanian league.  Now in the PL he is slowly learning that you can't take as many risks, the players are faster and more talented, you can get burned very quickly by taking a risk.  Luckily for us you can coach someone to be smarter about taking risks, you can work on decision making, he can gain experience and learn from mistakes.  You cannot coach athletic ability or natural skill.  Meaning, we can improve the weak parts of Vlad's game.

Writing off a young CB when they have been in the league for 3 months is harsh. Writing off a young CB who was expected to be our 4th CB after 3 months is shortsighted.  Really, we shouldn't know what we really have in Vlad until sometime NEXT season but at the earliest we should hold judgement until the end of the season.

He is having a rough go of things at the moment, in a perfect world we wouldn't be relying on him to be a starting CB at this point. He will start to settle and learn.  We just have to hope that his mistakes caused by taking chances don't burn us while he learns.

The equalities act is not specific to property or lettings. It  is a general standard governing business and governmental services.

The biggest change of its introduction has been insurance and pensions.

Private lettings where the landlord has a live in relationship is different in business structure to any other, service etc.

The point is before the 2010 act, discrimination was still not allowed, but this area of business isnt really covered, likewise with this area today it isn't really specifically covered.

You can still discriminate for acting roles and caring roles where its justified or based on the whims of personal standards. (although caring may have been superseded now).

You don't really understand how the law works, a legal expert can claim something is illegal all she wants, if it hasn't gone to the courts, and tested its a unverified claim, she is 1 of a handful that thinks its covered, everyone else and the existing practice says it isn't covered. And has established status quo and commonality on their side.

If we applied your absurd lack of logic elsewhere, i would be unable to take out a lonely hearts advert to the newspaper seeking women only, as it still falls under the equalities act as my goods and services are free. And i limiting the recipient of my affection to my personal specifics.

Whatever justification you can use for a personal lonely hearts advert you can use for a flat mate, its blurred lines, the same is not true for a job or open property.

Its disturbing you think you live in a world with such regimented distinct boxes.

Finding a flatmate or housemate is not the same as finding a tenant for a property, in either practice or principle. As is finding a wife is not the same as finding an employee for a position.

The equality law was brought in specifically for business and service agreements for citizens,  not to legislate the idiosyncratic values of individual personal relationships.

Any legal professional would never take the case of equality act discrimination for shared tenancy because they are not that stupid  and nor are the courts.

Your problem is you cant tell the difference between business and services, and personal relationship conveniences.

I'm not sure why he's my Doctor, I can't really say. Maybe it was the speeches, or the energy, there's just that indescribable knowledge that he was (and is) my Doctor. 

To be honest I was sadder to see 10 go because I was younger then and it was only the second regeneration I'd experienced. Now that Matt's gone, I knew it was coming, and I was dreading it, but it's just what happens. Things change. Capaldi's around now, but unlike most people, he hasn't won me over just yet. I'm probably still bitter at the regeneration; not *because* it happened, but how. Smith being the third doctor to die from old age when falling from a great height should have been what did him in - taking the 'Fall of The Eleventh' literally. The crack and the silence also being briefly pointed out with somewhat poor explanation irked me. 

The instant snap regeneration just didn't do it for me. Moffat just can't seem to write anything normally. Instead of trying to surprise people constantly he should have just done what usually happens, for consistency's sake.

But I digress. 

11 was my Doctor, and although his final episode was definitely not one of my favourites, it was still good because he was in it. I'll watch Capaldi's first episode, but if Moffat's writing gets on my nerves too much, I feel like I'll have to stop. And wait.

Oh great. Now I'm wondering who 13 will be. Unlucky number, that is.

Matt Smith will be missed, but I've no doubt we'll see him in the 60th anniversary. He'll only be in his early 40s at that point.

Just when Redknapp had won me round a few weeks ago...fickle bastard that I am, freezing out the likes of Mackie, Diakité, Hitchcock et al. might have the pendulum swinging back the other way. Guys like that have their foibles and are unlikely to be the tip of the spear in pushing for a return to the top, but they would have been nice options to reach for last night. There are a lot of question marks in my head over what exactly is going on in team selection right now. For one thing, does anyone know what our best starting line-up is? Especially in midfield? As the LFW post says, what exactly was expected from a starting 11 containing out-of-form Zamora and Henry? Fair enough Redknapp is paid sacks of cash every year to know better than me, but I wanked away enough evenings as a youngster on Football Manager to believe that sometimes you click through to the kids to look at emergency options for a striker. Onuoha's treatment is a bit of a strange one too.

Mercifully no matter what division we're in next season, there will be no option but to rebuild the squad due to the scheduled contract expiration exodus. It might not be such a bad thing for the long term if that is done without Redknapp, whose presence has deprived us of what are for me more interesting possibilities like Rosler and McClaren. Not that I want Redknapp sacked, but if he walks away after a midtable Championship finish the stars might align nicely. The squad he's assembled looks like a castle built on sand right now.

However knowing that it was legally defined and excluded as allowed before the 2010 act and knowing what the 2010 act specifically addresses and why, you will understand why it is still allowed.

If the article gave details of a prosecution  or a case, then yes i would be Wrong. But what you seem to not understand is that in any legal dispute there are always at least two legal ""experts"" who are in disagreement of the facts/laws/events. And so an article finding a university expert effectively saying ""discrimination is discrimination"" , is hardly a conclusive and authoritative position of good standing.

However a continued presence and existence of exclusive preferences stated in adverts with no pending cases or prosecution IS GOOD EVIDENCE to the Likely implementation and meaning of the law as it states.

The 2010 law doesn't really do anything that wasn't present before, its just a token law to stop outright large scale discrimination such as pensions and insurance etc.

The lonely hearts example is absolutely relevant and specific to this case, and is completely of the same principle.

I'm absolutely thrilled with how well he's playing right now and I hope that miss doesn't damage his confidence.

I'm a bit angry with the officiating.  It's rare that I stay mad about things like that but Mason and his team did an absolutely fucking awful job yesterday.  They basically denied us a goal when Sterling was through (I'd fancy him to beat Hart but who knows I guess) and then failed to pick up the beating that Kompany/Lescott were handing out to Suarez.

Maybe it's petty to be mad about the refs, but it was painful to watch.

Feel free to not take me seriously, but it wasn't just one call.  It went on throughout the game and it stifled us.  It did make a big impact on the game, and thus it is a problem.

your understanding of London seems odd  to me.

because i moved from Yorkshire to London 2 years ago, and my living costs are about £200 a month more, and thats it. My commute times are the same, thats with the same living arrangements, thats with owning and maintaining the same car that i had beforehand. Fine, going out is more expensive, but even if I factor that in at the very most its a 5k difference. And yet the jobs in london pay a lot more (I got a 12k rise when i first moved, another 4k within 2 years, and if i wanted to change jobs right now a 20k rise is the low end of what im looking at), as well as having much better conditions (nicer offices, beer fridges, pool tables, free fruit and snacks, etc.).

true,DukeMaximum,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"You're probably referring to ""The Deadly Assassin"" which, to my knowledge, was the first episode to establish the 12 regeneration-rule. It was a fourth doctor episode where the Master appears and is seeking new regenerations. But even in that episode, it wasn't made clear that this was a biological limitation. In fact, the point wasn't even really emphasized, but rather mentioned in passing as to why the assassination of the Lord President of Gallifrey was permanent, and why the Master was so desperate to gain more regenerations.

Then we see in ""Trial of a Time Lord"" that not only can a Time Lord gain more regenerations, but that there can be incarnations of a Time Lord outside of his regular incarnations, as it is revealed that the Valeyard is an amalgamation of the darker parts of the Doctor's personality, extracted between his twelfth and thirteenth incarnations, but doesn't count toward his total number of incarnations.

Finally, there are several theories as to the origin of the Time Lord ability to regenerate, but all of them acknowledge that the Time Lords didn't always have that ability, and most give credit to Rassilon for inventing it. So, really, there's never any evidence that the ability is biological, while there's a great deal of evidence that it's technology-based.

Finally, in the Sarah Jane Adventures episode ""Death of the Doctor,"" the eleventh Doctor explicitly states that he can regenerate 507 times.

I feel we are favourites along with Chelsea. I don't like being in the position of title favourites, puts too much pressure on the team.
I don't really think Arsenal and Liverpool are a threat for the title, moreso, I think United could pose a bigger threat now that they're in good form again.

&gt; Also, what's going on with Guidetti in the winter window? Will he be out on loan, because he is such a talent and it'll be easy for him to not get many games when behind the likes of Aguero/Negredo/Dzeko/Jovetic

I don't know about Guidetti, I personally believe he should go on loan to a premier league midtable/relegation side so he can prove himself in a league where they can actually defend, because we don't know his qualities when it matters. He won't get a chance at City this season that's for sure.

&gt; will Pellegrini be likely to sell Dzeko in order to get more first team minutes for Guidetti to aid his development?

As I said, we don't know how (potentially) good Guidetti is so it's hard to say. As for Dzeko, I don't think they'll sell him even though I feel he's wasted on the bench here at City. He's a good striker but not the kind that fits into this current City team. Pellegrini sees him as a decent backup for Negredo now, but he wants to play every game, he hates the bench (can't blame him of course)

that's not an assumption - Just do a google search for hit and runs and see the staggering amount that no one talks about outside of local news for a day or two at best.

We have had this conversation before - and Ill repeat what I said then....A cyclist does something silly it not unusual for it to make national (or even international news). A driver does the same thing and no one outside local news cares.

And this is a prime example of that.

Little stat....It takes (nationally) cyclists 5 years to kill the same amount of people motorized traffic kill every day.

The trio of MAZACAR can be then a fluid attack mid with good protection behind them, and can even be our first choice attack subject to rotation. 


The case with Luiz is that he lacks quality as a CB. He has some inherent risks to his game and defensive qualities, which to be fair is not needed at all. Its good to have a ball playing CB, but only without the risks if possible. His positional and timing senses also seem a bit poor.

And I would criticse them too for the same reasons.

The reason I don't is because I don't feel perpetuating anger towards motorists is any real concern for motorists (being protected by their car and having a massive road system mostly designed around them). Unlike cyclists of course who have on many occasions come up against shitty attitudes on the road perpetuated by some stuff you might read online.

&gt;Furthermore - individual drivers are registered, licensed to drive and traceable by their details. Tracing an individual cyclist is nowhere near as simple once an incident has occurred to the extent that if a cyclist runs a red light I wouldn't even try and report it. If a motorist does - I would. I simply would not expect anything to come of reporting a cyclist breaking the law.

that's not an argument that holds much if any water.

Being registered hardly stops people using their phone for example. How many times a day do you see that? and how many times a day do you call to tell the police?

The point is, you phoning the police to inform them of a cyclist jumping a light is just silly, and registration wouldn't change that. You want cyclists to stop doing it then ask the police to stop them at the point which they do it.

&gt;not see motorists breaking road laws with such ease and frequency and hell 

you've jumped the shark. 

Go stand outside a speed warning sign and see how often it does off. Go have a look for people using their phone, go look and see how many cars blocking pavements, go see general dangerous anti social driving. If you are not seeing you have very selective vision.

Worth pointing out too all of those very frequent infractions are done by registered, trained and licensed car drivers.

On a serious point though cycling isn't really dangerous at all, it's been established gardening is a more dangerous pursuit (all those trip hazards and pointy tools, not to mention mowers / strimmers). However when some play the victim card its inevitable that others will play the incompetent/lack of self responsibility card, and stories like this are just fuel for the fire.

I would say though that I am far happier with the 'country bumpkin' cycling culture I grew up with rather than the important 'cycle courier' culture that (seems to be according to the media) taking over in London, where everything is a race and if you're not 20-45 and male you need not apply. It's the same problem in motorcycling actually - if you are a defensive rider chances are you will have a long and happy time on the bike. Look at the accident stats and far away it's the 'born again' male riders who are getting killed and injured. Yet they're only to happy to laugh at some granny on a moped who probably actually does follow the traffic rules.

He is trying to recoup some of the money he lost and get out of the club. Whilst financial security is important, running our club like a business and forgetting we actually have a football team is killing any hope the fans have of success. Get out while you can ;)


If you choose to ignore that advice, like I seem to do, then here's some info to get you started! Others have touched on our overall history but as my Dad only convinced me to support Villa at the start of the 2006-07 season, I will take you from there. 


Lerner took over Villa at the same time Martin O'Neill became manager. Lerner made vast amounts of cash available, O'Neill assembled an experienced team light on flair, but hard working and with a few top quality players. We got to 6th position, just outside the champions league places, 3 seasons in a row. We also had a couple of great cup runs losing to United (mainly the ref) in the Carling cup final and Chelsea in the FA cup semi final. Man City and Spurs emerged and started spending money even Lerner couldn't match and realistically our champions league challenge was over.


However, the O'Neill era created an enormous problem and directly contributes to the mess we're in 3.5 years later. He spent vast amounts of money on average players that were coming towards the end of their careers. The transfer fees were a problem, but the wages were the real issue. So these players were very happy to sit on these huge contracts with very little motivation to play their best. They knew they would never get a better deal elsewhere so they just collected their millions. Lerner foolishly allowed this overspending to continue under Houllier, which added even more to the wage bill. Even McLeish brought in 3 similar players that have been draining our resources ever since. This put us in big financial difficulty, losing £54 million a season at one point.


After Houllier came the era of financial cutbacks. The playing staff was stripped of all quality and experience. We came to rely too heavily on young players and cheap imports. No continuity in football style, some awful managerial appointments and poor signings have led to the relegation battles we find ourselves in. The current manager - Lambert - promised more at first. But in reality 18 months later we are hardly better off on the pitch than when he joined. The project he has taken on to improve young players is not working as barely any are worth more than when they arrived.


The fans don't expect miracles, we just want to have some decent football and something to cheer about. I am starting to think that can only ever come with new ownership. Nobody is queueing up. We owe Lerner a lot of money and he doesn't seem willing to let any of it go. But the infrastructure is there. We have great training facilities, a great academy (who won the equivalent of the under 19 champions league last season), big stadium in a big city, big fan base and a relatively high revenue. Even with the awful football, we still get over 30,000 every game at Villa Park and our away support is phenomenal. The club have also done a good job of promoting us in the US and far east recently, so we are ""growing"" globally. If some billionaire or company can look past the unfashionable Birmingham location and see our potential, not much would need to be done to turn us into a top team except investment in players and coaches.


**TL;DR - we are really poor on the pitch but we have strong history, support and infrastructure. there is hope for the future and if we were taken over by the right people, everything is in place for us to get into Europe again.**

Would we see Mata in a Chelsea shirt next season or the season after? Maybe. There's no chance the club would sell someone a *that* good to a direct rival considering the funds the club has at its disposal. If a club like PSG, Juventus, or Barcelona flashed some serious cash I could see him leaving in that instance.

Otherwise, they're going to have to suck up the playtime until their contracts expire in 2016 and 2017.

&gt; Will Luiz last long enough to wear the captain's armband in the post-JT era?

Maybe, but I don't think he's going to be our next captain. Cech is third in the pecking order for captain, so realistically if Terry leaves it would fall to Lampard, and if he left it would fall to Cech. 

But, let's say Lampard and JT retire at the same time to go sail around the world together and open a vineyard, and Courtois comes back and pushes Cech to the bench for most games in a season. 

Who becomes the next captain?

I would say Ivanovic, mainly because he's a big imposing defender capable of really controlling situations out of play on the pitch. He's would also be a Chelsea veteran at that point having been at the club since our last league triumph in 09/10. 

Gary Cahill would probably become a vice-captain, and David Luiz (should he still be around) could probably be a 3rd captain.


**tl;dr:** Unless the price is really right Mata and Luiz are not going to be sold because Chelsea doesn't sell.

Seriously, all because David or Juan hasn't started a few games doesn't mean they are out the door. 

Ashley hasn't started for a shit load of games but started against Swansea, does that mean he's out? 
Cahill didn't start against Swansea, is he out? Schrulle hasn't started in awhile, is he out?

We have a MASSIVE squad this season, even more so that we are stacked with midfield options to suit nearly any tactic Jose decides to use. 

Mata doesn't fit every tactic and neither does Luiz, Cahill, Willian, Schrulle, Lamps, Mikel etc.

It sounds like you had lots of road experience when you moved into it. I have basically no experience on a bike  other than some minor dirt biking for a year when I was 13 and even less in a car. With this in mind, do you think it's worth my time to just stick with a 125 for a bit? I paid for my provisional this morning so assuming I can get my theory and CBT out the way by the end of January/mid-way through February I think it might make sense to maybe get comfortable on a bike of that size for a couple months (say till my 21'st birthday in June) then start the process of moving onto my A2.

And that's why some people who happen to ride bikes get defensive when things like ""Why do cyclists X?"" come up.

Technically speaking they were *never* blasted to death.

From what little I've seen of Benayoun I think he has some creativity left in him yet.  I'd say Barton has been the best in *midfield* so far this year. O'Neil has a fantastic work rate and I'd keep him in the starting lineup for that reason alone.  Hoilett, regardless of his one track mind for cutting in and having a shot blocked, his pace often leads to us breaking down the left side.  Carroll, in my opinion, hasn't been special.  Seems like a budding youngster with a lot of creativity and a high work rate.  I think he, along with Hitchcock, are too young to excel at this level of football.  Krancjar has proven ability but has unfortunately been lackluster so far.  He seems a little overweight and lacking motivation but I feel as though he will improve.  Matt Phillips, well, he probably scored the best goal I've seen all year for us and his inclusion in the squad is not up for debate.


I would like to see Traore and Diakite get a chance.  Also, it was reported that Mackie wanted to go, and had handed in a transfer request.


We lack a natural goal scorer, it has been our problem all year.  The January transfer window will be key in our push for promotion.  It would be nice to pick up a youngster with the potential to excel in the Premier League and hopefully even loan experienced forward with top-level European experience.

They still only played without ONE of their best players. That does not speak to depth. The fact of the matter is they have a strong team, yes, but they haven't demonstrated it any differently than they have all season just from the few games Aguero has been absent from. Had they been missing Aguero, Yaya and Silva all at once that would've been a remarkably different scenario.

Terrible handball call? The one that was called on Lucas while he was getting fouled which immediately preceded the corner that Kompany scored on. If that foul was called as it should, the corner never happens, the goal doesn't happen.

We ran circles around them in the first half and they had a couple chances outside of the two aforementioned that they shouldn't have scored on. They had what, one shot that hit off the bar and a few dangerous crosses and that was it.

There are a number of players who will be available in January. Sure, prices may be inflated, but there are several clubs with quality players that could make use of selling those players - Sevilla is one of them. There are also several clubs who don't appreciate the quality players they have. When did we sign Suarez, Sturridge and Coutinho again? Rodgers has made it clear he will be looking to sign first team players in January so obviously, out of the hundreds of players around the world that could be deemed worthy of such a label, there is someone out there he and his crew have eyes on.

And we all know how quality Aspas has been when asked to win one back for us. That's why we've seen so much of him with Sturridge and Suarez both healthy (not including when he was injured himself).

&gt; *Then a government advisor will put together a list of morally unacceptable sites to add to the list, and ISPs will voluntarily oblige, and customers will agree to this filter when they sign up to the service.*

&gt; *There are different levels of optional. Before this, people had the option to implement third party filters, and that option has existed for a long time. Now ISPs are forcing people to make a choice at the point of purchase. Honestly, how long do you think it will be before they have a default choice in place, which you have to take action to reverse? Then how long before they make it harder to reverse the filter (i.e. having to send in ID documents to prove your age, or pay a fee)? It's all little baby steps to ease us into censorship, they're not stupid enough to try and impose it on the public in one move.*

true,rishichico,num23,,"Paulinho is decent IMO. But having Paulinho, Dembele and Sandro on the pitch at the same time is a BIG mistake. They all drive with the ball and do not pass. 

Defoe is not as good as Soldado IMO. Soldado is getting more and more involved with play and sooner or later he will start bagging goals. Defoe is getting into good positions but he is nowhere near clinical enough to be considered a top striker for a team fighting for CL. Soldado isn't the type to get onto crosses, he wants the ball played early so he can have a 1v1. But we do not move the ball quick enough for him to ever be in that position.

I agree with Chadli and Lamela. They have not got to grips with the speed of the game. Lamela is improving but still has a long way to go. 

Chiriches is another BAE but this time at CB. He takes too long on the ball and players seem to get past him way too easily. 

Dawson is decent, but he needs someone reliable with him. Vertonghen is the main man in defence. He is the leader at the back. We need another LB asap because risking injuries to Vertonghen at LB is just outrageous!!! 

Eriksen is amazing. BUT we cannot play him deep. He is an attacking minded player so he doesnt offer much defensively and he may get caught on the ball.

Bogle will talk you through the process as your granddad would, full of anecdotes and ideas. Hale will give you the facts, consider the questions, and draw absolute conclusions. Hale definitely satisfied my scientific/enquiring mind. Best move is to read both and here is the most important part, to do all of the calculations yourself! Put your numbers into the spreadsheets and make it a real exercise. Second, to affirm your decisions and actions reach out and solicit as much advice as you can.

Regeneration isn't just same man new face. It's death, rebirth, living, death, and rebirth. It's the rebirth that scares them all.

He needs to mentally reassess what's going on. His passing is gradually improving, and his defensive ability is huge for a CM. 

Defoe just as good as Soldado? Ok man. I disagree. And its nuts that so many people are like, ""how do you not start Defoe? He's a goalscorer, pure and simple."" and yet in the 4 games in the PL he does start he doesn't make it happen. He's short, untalented on the ball, and makes questionable decisions often. He is not the answer. Ade scored 3 goals because he is in the right place mentally and is very very skilled. While we cant say he hasnt gotten any service anymore, wealso cant say he is a bad strker since he has scored many, many goals in his career.

Chadli isn't good enough to start you say? I dont disagree, but he's still quite good as depth. He is big and physical and improves every game.

Chiriches/Dawson- Dawson is basically bad every single match. Even yesterday, which was one of his ""best"" matches this season, the neutral I was watching with commented on how awful he was. Not chiriches, but Dawson was awful. Dawson consistently found himself upfield during counterattacks, and was just too slow to get back on defense. He left people open and didn't mark his man during the free kick goal. For someone so tall, he is horrible aerially. People cut him slack on his lack of physicality because they assume he is technically skillful and intelligent, but he isnt. He often makes reckless tackles and s too slow back on his feet, he misses people's runs behind him, etc. He loves launching long balls straight to offside players or the opposing team. Chriches on the other hand is turning out to be a fantastic player. He is playing through an injury right now, so he's had his worst performances thus far the past 2 games.

Every shot he misses he looks more and more frustrated. Makes it hard for me to be frustrated at him. It's not like with Adebayor last year, where he missed penalty shots by a wide margin and would laugh about it. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad Adebayor is playing and scoring, and I hope he stays in form and remains positive, but history tells us he won't. Maybe this time will be different, but long term, of the strikers we have now, I still think Soldado is the best option.

She said: “You don’t need mechanical competence to drive a train any more. Previous research has indicated that it could be a disadvantage to minority groups, so the question is why is it still in there from a legal point of view, because it could amount to indirect discrimination.”

So by lowering the knowledge and skills needed for the job, she implies that women are incapable of completing the same tests that men are able to do. Which also amounts to indirect discrimination.

I think that everyone should be given an equal and fair opportunity to get any job. People should be hired based on ability and skill regardless of age, sex, or race.

Stunning views over southern Edinburgh but not public I'm afraid unless it's changed recently (source: I used to work at an EIF host venue and went to the hub for training a few times) IIRC, the hub's spire is the highest man made point in edinburgh, just pipping the top of St Giles' cathedral. The hub also has quite a few rather fancy function rooms, which host party and ceilidh nights and probably the odd small scale performance too.

New college was briefly the home of the Scottish parliament, after devolution began but before the new parliament building was constructed at the bottom of the royal mile. You can wander through the internal (though still outside) courtyard via a narrow close going from the mound to the royal mile (just opposite the hub actually).

true,nowonmai666,lfc99,null,"&gt; Not sure what you all think but from an outside perspective Liverpool can definitely go for top 3 this season.

I agree, we have a good chance but there are more than 3 teams who can say that. Man City and Chelsea will probably be the top two. I think Arsenal might well suffer their traditional Spring collapse, but if not they're probably ahead of Liverpool too. Man Utd and Everton are a concern, but I don't think they can do anything Liverpool don't have the ability to match if we play as well as we should.

So I'm optimistic for top 4.

As for yesterday's game: I think we did quite well considering the opposition. As last year, I felt we did enough to be able to say ""we could have won that if luck had been on our side"". The better team won, but it was close. Ignoring the linesman's howler, our biggest problem was that our best chances fell to young players and defenders. We're still a team in transition and still short of goalscorers, so that's going to happen.

So that's pleasing. What was different from last season was just how fucking terrifying Man City are in attack. Even without Aguero (who i rate as the second best player in the league after you-know-who). I can't think when I've ever seen such precision at such a blinding pace. They're playing with such incredible confidence, but it's the pace the whole team moves at that impressed me most.

true,Omblae,UnionFlag,Surreh - Honda Hornet CB600F,"No worries man, it's a really confusing system the only reason I know about it is because I've already had to jump through all the hoops! Just in case you weren't aware you don't need to take a theory test to take a CBT - it's only if you want a full licence of any category that you have to take one. 

If you have no road experience then yes it might be useful, the only problem is having a 125 can be a PITA if you want to travel distance. If you're only going to be pottering around town, then I'd highly recommend it - they're such a blast to play with. If you're really worried about being overwhelmed, then I suggest you may be better off doing the full course and perhaps buying a lower powered bike instead - 47hp is the limit not a necessity! Remember, the course will make you comfortable on a bike - in a way that a day long CBT simply cannot match. If I were in your shoes and had the dosh, I'd do the full test - you can always buy a 125 afterwards if you're not comfortable but it'll be more of a pain doing a CBT, getting a 125, then realising you want more power and having to do the whole thing over again with more testing and buying a new bike! 

Having said that, 250cc (see Ninja 250, CBR 250) bikes are the best of both worlds, almost always about as light as a 125 (often companies will use the same chassis for the 250 as they do the 125) meaning they're easy to manage, not as crazy a sensitive throttle as bigger bikes but with just enough extra grunt to mean you can comfortably do 70 on the motorway - which honestly makes all the difference. In other countries they're the go-to for many learners for this reason, but they do suffer from the same problem as 125s in that their prices are artificially inflated - albeit not as badly mind. 

Let me be frank with you, it's a scary prospect thinking about buying a motorcycle when you've never really experienced one. But if you have a willingness to learn and listen to what your instructor tells you, I assure you you'll be comfortable in no time. When I was 16, I didn't qualify for a 125 to take my CBT on so I did it on a little 50cc moped - no gears, no foot brake etc. But the bike I ended up buying was a 125 with gears - so my first experience of true motorbiking was when I went to look at one and nearly dropped the bugger! But it only took me an hour of riding it around a carpark to get used it it - then from then on it was all easy. Moving to a GS500 for my test was way less daunting - it was way easier to manage in many ways. Having that extra bit of throttle helps you in more ways than you can imagine once you have the controls down, but until then perhaps it's best you stick to something a little less powerful and gradually move your way up like you say. I'd just be aware that doing the full test does give you more opportunities - both to learn how to handle the machine properly and also how to ride defensively on the road - plus it gives you the option of having a choice over what sort of bike you want/feel most comfortable on. 

NB. if you decide you're going to do the full test - FIND OUT WHERE YOUR LOCAL TESTING CENTRE IS! Mod 1 test pads are made from race track spec tarmac, with a drainage system for the rain to make sure those taking the tests don't slip over too badly - meaning that they are often few and far between. Wherever the local centre is, get onto a course with a school that is very close by - it'll help with both the Mod 1 and Mod 2 practical tests and gives you the ability to practice on the roads you'll be tested on.

true,atlwantsmls,num11,,"Being a baseball fan myself, here's what I've learned about cricket.

First, Cricket is pretty similar to baseball but the key difference is that in baseball, it is easy to get out and hard to get on base/score runs.  In baseball, you get 27 outs, and scoring 5 runs/hitting .300 is pretty good.  You can fail 70 percent of the time and you are considered successful.

In cricket, it's easier to score runs and hard to get out.

If Guidetti wants to go on loan we need to show why anyone at a higher level would want to risk having him in their squad considering his injury prone past. Who knows what level he's on at the moment? 

Hopefully Zaba will have a rest for tomorrow's game. We know it was a risk to play him against Liverpool, so putting him on the field a mere 48 hours later wouldn't be too smart. Milner or Boyata at RB maybe? Nasty making his return would be a great thing to see! When was the last time Kompany and Nastastic actually started together?

We'll probably see a stronger team starting than we're anticipating over here. Pellers is very aware of our somewhat bad away form, and another loss away from home against a relegation side wouldn't look good at all. But I'm crossing my fingers for some playing time for the younger lads!

Option 1: I would recommend taking the train to Mallaig from either Edinburgh or Glasgow.

Arisaig and Morar are well worth getting off to stay for a night or two as well.

Option 2: Perthshire by Bus! Further south, yet full of small towns and hills and valleys and woods. Dunkeld, with a wee walk by the river Tay(flat)/Birnam hill(small)/The Hermitage(flat). Aberfeldy, Pretty wee town with shops, cafes, campsite, BnBs etc, river walks, woods, the Birks...

Sometimes it'll be too far away from him to pick a pass because he'll already be under pressure.

It's a small part of his game, but it can have a big impact. If you can play with your head up then you will have more time on the ball, just look at Xavi.

racism is:

the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics, abilities, or qualities specific to that race, especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races.

There are races, to argue that there aren't is ridiculous.  You're trying to re-brand the word racism to incorporate those who are vocally critical of Islam.  You can be a critic of Islam and not be a racist (me), you don't have to be both.  Are you really trying to argue that there are no racial differences in the human species? It annoying to me is because you can't be a critic of Islam without being called a racist (a misuse of the word in the context of Islam) which will undermine anything you say thereafter.  Just as much as the Qu'ran doesn't pertain to a race neither do it's critics (well, the non-racist ones).  I am just as critical of Richard Dart as I am Abu Hamza regarding their interpretations of the Qu'ran.

Also might I add, Jews aren't a single easily traceable race as once previously thought (the classification of Jews as a race of their own is murky territory):

We currently have one of the best Squads not only in the BPL, but in the World, and we can't even successfully beat a team, not once, but twice, who happen to be 20th in the League (if that doesn't make your ears ring with something, you've got problems).

Then look at our system, how is it? Oh right, it doesn't exist. We have the best players in the World, and we don't even have a system in place. Now unless you have an eye for patterns in the game, you won't see the problem, but if you do, you'll see it, and those who do moan, are the ones who see. Robbie Savage, the utter fool he is, even thinks so, and if a fool like him sees it, so should you (please don't link to the Jose System video, thanks).

Squad selections - This is a big problem, always has been under Jose, he thinks he's unique or special with his selections, but they're terrible. Willian over Schurrle multiple times, Lampard in CDM, Azpi over Cole, Ivan over Azpi at RB, utterly ridiculous choices (and this isn't a bash at our players, so don't use that against me, they don't choose their positions). 

Lastly, formation, it's terrible, it's old, it's easy to predict. We have midfield depth on another level compared to most clubs in the BPL, yet we have to rely on the individual talent of Hazard to get goals. Without Hazard, we'd be struggling even more, and I'll tell you something, I was never a fan of his, but this Season, he's proven himself in a poor poor team, and he's brilliant for it (even if I do think he'd be better at CF).

We're 3rd, and we should be 13th, but the League has been good to us thankfully, and we happen to have the a solid back 4 that is very hard to penetrate, again, that's not Jose, that's our players, and they proved that under Rafa and RDM, the back line is solid even with our poor defending from set pieces as of late.

So there's your CC. He's poor this Season, and lets be honest, if he was called Rafa, Pellagrini, Pochettino, Poyet - You'd be moaning, I know you would be, but the fact he's ""Jose"" means he can get away with piss poor management for 3 months.

How long do you need to see he cannot manage at this level? (he's never managed in a League with this amount of skill in his life) 6 months? 12 months? Maybe half way through the 2014/2015 Season when we're 10th? Yeah, Abramovich doesn't work like that, and Jose was VERY lucky to get the draw with Arsenal.

Under many Managers this Season, we'd be 1st, not only by a few points, but by many, and it drives me mad to see how much potential the squad has, and how poorly managed the team is.

Most obviously, who would play right back? I think the Walker -&gt; Naughton (or whoever else) downgrade would more than make up from whatever influence Walker might have in an unfamiliar position. Moving to a back 3 could be an option, but asking the entire defense to adjust to new roles, with Walker in an unfamiliar position ahead of them, would be dangerous.

Secondly, as others have already said, I'm not sure he has the attributes to succeed as a central midfielder. He's not particularly positionally disciplined, he's not a great reader of the game... his incredible athleticism allows him to track back when he's inevitably caught out of position, but I'm not sure what reason there is to believe this would be less of a problem if he moved inside.

I think Dani Alves is probably a good comparison. Alves has been played inside and as a wide midfielder and it's generally been unsuccessful.

we beat sunderland once and lost to sunderland once. We did not drop points to sunderland both times. So this statement is incorrect.

&gt;Then look at our system, how is it? Oh right, it doesn't exist. We have the best players in the World, and we don't even have a system in place. Now unless you have an eye for patterns in the game, you won't see the problem, but if you do, you'll see it, and those who do moan, are the ones who see. Robbie Savage, the utter fool he is, even thinks so, and if a fool like him sees it, so should you.

our system is either 4-2-3-1, has been what appears to be 4-2-4 once, occasionally reverts to a 4-3-3. I actually really like our formation currently, because it seems to be a hybrid of 4-2-3-1 and 4-3-3 with our squad seemingly switching between the two fluidly at points in matches.

as for robbie savage...

http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/25179761

this piece he did on the beeb the other week is definitely highly po-mourinho. Anecdotally, I actually can't remember Robbie Savage saying we have tactical problems, so if you could provide some sources for that I would be interested in reading them.

&gt;Squad selections - This is a big problem, always has been under Jose, he thinks he's unique or special with his selections, but they're terrible. Willian over Schurrle multiple times, Lampard in CDM, Azpi over Cole, Ivan over Azpi at RB, utterly ridiculous choices (and this isn't a bash at our players, so don't use that against me, they don't choose their positions).

willian over schurrle multiple times, i mean they are both so new that I don't know which one I would pick and I'm sure jose is having a similar problem. Lampard at CDM was definitely a huge mistake, he's made his game off of his in the box timing so there's nothing for him in the deep midfield. However, since those two games where he was tried out at CDM, I haven't seen him in that position so I believe the issue is firmly sorted.

Azpi over cole? Cole was injured, azpi was really solid at LB and bumped ashley from the squad. As Cole is 30, i'm sure mourinho wanted to leave him out of the squad for as long as it was viable to keep azpi at rb. As we saw cole start the other day, I am interested to see what mourinho's decisions for the fullback positions will be. As azpi had to fill in at left back, ivan played rb as he is fully capable and competent in that position.

&gt; We have midfield depth on another level compared to most clubs in the BPL, yet we have to rely on the individual talent of Hazard to get goals

how exactly does having depth in midfield equal goals? we do not have depth in strikers, and their job is to score goals. 

you then go on to say the following:

&gt;and I'll tell you something, I was never a fan of his, but this Season, he's proven himself in a **poor poor team**, and he's brilliant for it (even if I do think he'd be better at CF).

but in your second paragraph you say

&gt; We currently have one of the **best Squads not only in the BPL, but in the World**

so not only do you contradict yourself, you don't seem to actually know which side of the fence you fall on. So I'm not really sure what the point of this is, except to be inflammatory.

Unlike basketball, hockey or football where players come in and out frequently, having one player to come in and replace another does not signify depth. We have depth at cb. We don't have real depth at any other position besides maybe center mid. Depth is where you can unquestionably field a strong side no matter how many first choice players are absent. We are not at that point and winning without Suarez does not contradict that. Winning without Aguero didn't demonstrate that either. 

You can stop reading wherever you choose that doesn't change how much Liverpool dictated the flow of the first half before City took the lead. That is why city tried so hard to slow the game down because they were seeing little possession.

Aspas is only returning from injury but even before he wasn't going to go out and be a super sub. I'm not writing him off.

As far as I'm concerned, we both lost games, and if you watched the games, you would of seen how lucky we were to lose them in the fashon we did. Again, results don't really mean anything when we're discussing patterns, systems, and how our team play with the level of skill we have. It's very easy to judge a game from a results POV.

&gt;our system is either 4-2-3-1, has been what appears to be 4-2-4 once, occasionally reverts to a 4-3-3. I actually really like our formation currently, because it seems to be a hybrid of 4-2-3-1 and 4-3-3 with our squad seemingly switching between the two fluidly at points in matches.

That's fine, but I hate the formation for our team, and there are different formations out there that suit attacking midfielders a lot better i.e. 4-1-2-1-2, 4-1-3-2, 4-1-4-1, 3-5-2.

&gt;how exactly does having depth in midfield equal goals? we do not have depth in strikers, and their job is to score goals. 

A deep midfield means you control play, you create chances, you dominate the team, it's simple football.

&gt;so not only do you contradict yourself, you don't seem to actually know which side of the fence you fall on. So I'm not really sure what the point of this is, except to be inflammatory. 

Not at all, we have one of the best sqauds out there - But we don't have a system that supports the team, therefore we're playing very very poor, we're playing crap football.

Hope that clears it up.

It's apparent you haven't read the article you linked, otherwise you would understand that the author is saying ""sweeper"" is a word that has lingered in the English lexicon and transformed to describe an unusual playing style. When it's used to describe a position that's not actually a *sweeper*, it's used in conjunction with the position to describe the play style of *that* position. For instance, Lahm would be a sweeper-holder. I've seen Lloris described as a sweeper-keeper. This does not make them *sweepers*. Neither does a single blogger calling a player a sweeper (which he doesn't if you actually read the article). Sweeper describes a very specific position, and Lahm is not a sweeper.

Now, you could have just answered my question:

SORN is intended to discourage people from driving an uninsured, untaxed, or un-MOT'd vehicle and hoping not to get caught out. It doesn't absolutely prevent these things, but it means in order to do so, you actually have to specifically lie. That makes some people think twice.

Driving outside MOT is potentially dangerous, driving without insurance is  irresponsible, driving without tax, less of a big deal, but pretty unfair on everyone else.

Here is the reply from Imgur when I contacted their support;

*We believe this to be an issue specific to UK users on the Sky ISP. We were improperly blocked by them over a week ago, and this seems to be some sort of residual effect after the unblocking. We are not able to reproduce the issue on our end, and have contacted our CDN, Cloudflare to ensure that there are no issues with them either. Unfortunately, we've found nothing we can do from our end to fix this issue.* 

*If you are a Sky customer, perhaps you wouldn't mind reaching out to them? We have a notion that they may have neglected to unblock the HTTPS version of the site, which is used specifically on the sign in page.*

As for Gimp, I can access it from my mobile on its 3G connection, but if I switch my mobile access to use the same Sky account (wireless) in my home, I am unable to get to the website. To me that shows the issue is with Sky &amp; not that Gimp is down.


Edit; It may be coincidence, but I have had zero problems accessing any site until around a couple of weeks ago when this all started. I understand that it is meant to be an optional filter but I have a theory based on that Imgur reply that by tweaking lines of code somewhere, it has put other lines of code out of sync which have denied access. I might be wrong but then again I'm not a programmer.

The big revelation of his grave, contained inside the TARDIS ruins, with its ""scar tissue"" that enables time travel, exploration of the Doctor's lives and time, would have fit seamlessly, in my opinion.

The xmas episode, therefore, could've been called ""The Name of The Doctor"". No further changes would be necessary in my naming convention as the previous finale would have served as a moment of foreshadowing to the resolution of the regeneration cycles. That might've made more sense in my opinion.

My reasoning: The name is what Clara said into the crack - to those on Gallifrey - to which rejuvenated and saved the Doctor from a final, terminal death. The name was the key to this episode. It was holding Gallifrey at bay. It was perpetuating the unfolding of events and what ultimately enabled a further regeneration. Clara, once again, like in ""The Day Of The Doctor"" saved the day.

In the xmas special, the name became a bigger factor as it's repression is the reason for the entire arc from the introduction of 11 in ""The Eleventh Hour"" (actually, since the events in the library where River Song first appears).

Luiz hasn't played consistently as a center-back since we won the champions league, in which he was one of our best players - defensively AND offensively. The season after we won the CL, RDM changed the system and the CBs had comparatively zero protection from the supposed DMs, which made them more vulnerable to attacks, and why we conceded so many goals.

Then came Benitez, who played Luiz at CB in the absence of JT (who is a much better organizer of the defence than Cahill and a better overall defender), then moved him to DM for almost half a season.

So what I'm saying is, you're making him sound a lot worse than he is. He is going to be an exceptional CB. Take a look at Gerard Pique, who everyone considered as an average defender before he went to Barca, and Luiz is still only 26. Brazilian defenders take a while to become solid.

We have lazier personalities in the UK. We don't want to deal with stuff, but we're not lazy and we have to deal with stuff so we just kind of do it without thought. It's our society that forces us to. In the US, people are generally more upbeat and outgoing and have dreams and aspirations of doing stuff, but the world is so convenient and easy.

There's endless differences I could note, but important stuff I'd say is that American strangers communicate with one another on a level that may lack depth but adds a lot to the collective good mood of the nation. In the UK, strangers don't interact so much. But much of that is likely because we're forced to live so close and interact so much. Everything goes back to that have to - or - want to thing.

Our lives in the UK are full of necessary added effort that many Americans will have never experienced.

For instance [see this interview](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/belinda-parmar/sugar-and-spice-unearthin_b_941426.html) with the Cambridge psychologist Simon Cohen.

None of this means that women should be excluded from being train drivers or that the women who become train drivers are any less worthy than their male colleagues.  It just means that we can't a priori claim that the split should be 50/50.

The Doctor's regeneration went from a regular part of the plot and something that happens to the character, to this forced epic thing that was clearly far more about giving the actor a swansong than telling a good story. I was really starting to like Smith, but by the time they finally got to the actual switch I just didn't want to see his face or hear his voice ever again. Not because the actor had stayed too long, because they just kept dragging it out. Once he got back to the TARDIS, that was a good regen scene. Recap the man, give a little speech, see an old friend. That was good. Pulling off the bow tie and letting it drop was pitch perfect. As was the snap of the head and viola, new guy. The 50 minutes leading up to that were pure Smith deserves an EPIC. Not the character. Not the story. Just actor-service.

There were so many superfluous bits and bots in Time that it could have easily been cut in half without losing any actual story. For example, the Angels.

Extensions exist because there are many on Gallifrey who live shorter riskier lives and they can be rewarded with more chances to do things for their sacrifices.

We *quite clearly* know they age at this point. There are children on Gallifrey. You can't have children if people do not age.

To buy a coach ticket check [this website](http://www.nationalexpress.com/home.aspx). These coaches are fast, clean and relatively comfortable and its runs on a good schedule. They are also the expensive coaches.

We don't really have a nailed-on starting XI or formation as such, despite AVB's 4-2-3-1 and Sherwood's 4-4-2 predilections.

I've often wondered about playing Walker as a fully fledged midfielder.  I don't know that he would work as well centrally, because his ball control at pace is not the closest, plus his greatest asset is being able to tear up 60 yards of the pitch at full stretch, something that you rarely see CMs or CDMs do because there's not the space.  There are very few high quality traditional wingers currently playing in the EPL, which means that from fullback, Walker often has the length of the sideline to run into.

The other major reason for not playing him there is that he's currently (with Vertonghen out) our best back.  Playing him in midfield robs us of that asset, which we desperately need.  None of our other backs aside Jan are top four quality in my mind, so losing many of Walker's covering tackles and his ability to get goal-side quickly will make our backline an even greater liability in my mind.

I've wondered about a 5-3-2, with him and Rose playing as very high wingbacks.  Their main job is offensive, but still with tracking back a part of the job description.  You then play 3 of Dawson, Kaboul, Vertonghen, Chiriches and even Capoue or Sandro in the middle, with one of them (probably Jan or Chiriches) tasked with bringing the ball out from the back.

It took time and coaching of those excellent players to make a championship winning team. Last season, Mancini lost the squad, and failed to harness their talents effectively, consequently ceding the title to a very average United squad.

Note also that I agree they should be further away from the chasing pack right now. Their away form isn't close to what it should be, and that's keeping them so close to Arsenal, us, Chelski, and even Everton -- all of whom are improving sides and by no means the finished article.

The argument that money equals success is easy to dismiss: look at Spurs. Look at Monaco! Look, if you will, at Real Madrid. They're fine squads, and some excellent teams (Spurs being the exception right now), but they're not automatically title winners every year. Winning titles requires consistent, excellent coaching.

Of course there's a strong environmental component.  The fact that we dress girls in pink for example is almost certainly 100% due to cultural factors.  But that nurture plays a role doesn't exclude the possibility that nature is also important.

So far the science is not unambiguous and scientists are still arguing over just how great the biological differences are, but it would be folly to a priori dismiss the possibility that at least some of the gender differences we see are mostly innate as opposed to the products of culture.

I think it's sensible to fight discrimination wherever you see it.  If British rail or anyone else is barring women from becoming train drivers then that would be an outrage- but that doesn't seem to be the case here.

Miles traveled though is totally irrelevant, and not a fair way to compare the dangers

hypothetically speaking - the distance a vehicle travels makes little odds to the danger it poses.

if a car travels 10x faster than a cycle, over the course of an hour is a car more or less dangerous than a cycle?

The best way to compare is volume, or time on the roads.

He didn't do much, if anything, wrong during his two appearances. He was very composed on the ball and was somewhat accurate with his passing even if they were just safe passes.

That being said, he's only had two appearances as a substitute against Southhampton who are, to my knowledge, a pretty young but talented team so I wouldn't exactly expect Bentaleb to be shrugged of the ball. His other appearance against West Brom who weren't really applying pressure from the time he came on until the end of the game. In both games, most of his passes were sideways or generally safe passes but he attempted some decent balls as well. He really held possession well in both games, but like I said, I would expect him to against Southhampton who aren't exactly big guys mostly and against a West Brom that parked the bus.

I think he's had two pretty good performances given his age and lack of experience in the PL and I'm okay with him getting time, but I'd say he's still probably a few seasons from a starting spot, especially given the talent and youth of our midfield already. I think he'll come good but I think he should go out on loan for a while. Right now, it's probably just that new player hype everyone gets.

Its statistical fact.

And its a logical one to as 15stone of bike/man traveling at say 17mph-24mph is not as lethal as 1-2ton of car traveling at say 30mph-65mph

that's not to say a cyclist cant kill someone (2 per year says they do) but it does means that statistically a car (due to its mass/speed) is considerably more dangerous.

Given that cyclists represent 2% of road traffic - for a bike to be as dangerous as motorized traffic - it would have to contribute 2% of the total 1765 deaths last year. Which would mean cyclists would contribute 34 deaths and not 2.

Please note - that when I say that I don't blame drivers for the extra deaths, or/and claim cyclists are saints. Its just a fact that mistakes and accidents are not equal between vehicle types.

I can't see Mourinho changing formations to a 4-3-3  - IIRC he said he wasn't going to play around with that anymore unless it was completely necessary. That's Mikel and Lampard's positions sorted then. 

In terms of the back line: Azpilicueta is almost certain to play. The one interesting decision will be who pairs Terry. Likely Cahill as Luiz played Thursday. Plus, in spite of Luiz being our best, most consistent defender last season I think his only off game in the CB position was against Liverpool. Not a deciding factor but a culmination of the two is likely to lead to a pairing of Terry and Cahill plus Ivanovic as at RB as usual.

Attacking midfielders: Hardest to predict when we have so many individuals performing well. Oscar and Hazard are almost definite starters. The defensive duties of those two will be vital against the likes of Henderson, Allen, Coutinho etc. The last position I'm not entirely sure about - it is very unlikely to be Mata (or De Bruyne) so I can see Willian, or perhaps Schurrle starting there. For now I'll go with Willian for his pace although Schurrle might as well be there for his work rate. Hard to tell.

Striker: It will be Torres. I'd personally rather see what Ba has to offer but I just can't see it being anyone else. Expect substitutions for this position in the match depending on what sort of attitude the team goes out with - a direct style of play is where Ba plays best.

That leaves the **Starting XI** (at a guess):

Cech

Ivanovic - Terry - Cahill - Cole

Mikel - Lampard

Willian - Oscar - Hazard

Torres

People will complain about players when there is an alternative but at the moment with our injuries, who could you start on the left who would do any better? Chadli has been unimpressive, Lamela is not great on the left, Lennon is out, Townsend is out. Anyone else would be playing out of position.

Maybe time to give Pritchard a run out...

I could see myself travelling for 90 minutes if the job was worth it. But there is no feasible way I could spend up to six hours a day purely on travelling... that is almost as long as a work shift. At what point does it stop being worth it? Fuel is expensive. Trains are expensive. You can't cycle that far and buses would take far too long.

I had a friend from Corby (a town in the East Midlands) who briefly had a job in London. Once she deducted the cost of commuting from her actual wages, she discovered that she had been better off on JSA. Needless to say she didn't keep that job for long. Unless you're on a fantastic wage, commuting from a place like Corby to London is just utterly pointless.

At this rate I dunno why more people can't just work from home... especially if they simply have office jobs (because who's gonna commute for 3 hours to work a minimum wage retail job?). They can use Skype for conference calls or have fax machines at home and be remotely connected to an intranet... I mean, if they underperformed the evidence would still be there. And who wouldn't love to work from home in their pyjamas? 

Meh, I dunno what I'm getting at here. I just find it appalling that people are commuting for this long each day. Wouldn't that begin to affect their actual job performance? I mean, you can't be expected to be at the top of your game at work if your home life is in shambles or if you're suffering that much stress.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"I really like Siggy.....but, he is a bit of a square peg in a round hole on our squad.

It actually reminds me a bit of Dempsey.  Its not that Dempsey is a bad player, but when he was with us we didn't have a position that would play to his strengths.  Siggy is the same, he is more suited to be in the center of the pitch.  When he was at Swansea he played well running in the channel on the right side that was opened up by the winger on the right, striker and other CM. He wasn't relied on to be a creator and wasn't expected to be a major contributor on defense (though he worked hard on defense), his job was to be another goal threat in the middle of the pitch.

For us, he isn't going to play in the middle of the pitch....Eriksen, Holtby, Dembele, Paulinho are all better midfielders and we don't (or haven't thus far) utilized an advanced player who sits in the support striker role (like we did with VDV).  That leaves Siggy to move outside.

Siggy is not a winger, its a waste to play him out there.  He doesn't have the pace, skill or mentality to play on the wing. He constantly gets very, very narrow when we ask him to be on the wing. People can argue that he is a ""inverted winger""....problem is, he isn't. Chadli (on the left), Lamela (on the right) and Townsend (on the right) are all capable of being inverted wingers.  They are players who bring the full spectrum of wing play to their game but when inverted have the ability to cut in and fire a shot.  Siggy doesn't have the full spectrum of skills needed to be on the wing, but he has a good shot. So he drifts inside and narrows the attack because he can't beat his man outside and doesn't excel in 1x1 situations.

On here people tend to have rose tinted view of Siggy because he works hard and is a likeable guy.  Yesterday he was not good, neither was Chadli. To me Chadli's poor performance was more glaring simply because regardless of the side of the pitch Chadli normally does a very good job of playing the role of a winger...he stays wide, he works the wing, hits crosses, takes on the defender....yesterday he kept drifting inside as did Siggy (i expect it from Siggy) which put all the pressure on Walker and Rose to provide width and clogged the middle pushing Ade/Soldado outside.  It was a poor performance by both, Chadli's performance was more noticeable to me because he didn't play in the way he normally does.",0,1388191592,null,0,false,0,cebitlu,t3_1tub8h,t1_cebitlu,t3_1tub8h,null,1427963202,48,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,48

I mean we always like The Doctor  matter what he looks like, but let's face it some of The Doctor's regenerations are far easier on the eyes than others. I'm sure he rather enjoys that, when he finds himself in a younger and rather handsome body. I mean who wouldn't? 

Hurt's Doctor he joked about having a midlife crisis and all, but I'll bet being a younger Doctor was fun for the Doctor, at least for a while.

Big-dumb-math for age-at-start for the actors goes like this (rounded to the year):

* Hartnell: 56 (left at 59)
* Troughton: 47 (49)
* Pertwee: 51 (55)
* Baker: 40 (47)
* Davison: 30 (33)
* C Baker: 41 (44)
* McCoy: 44 (46 on TV; 53 at regen into McGann)
* McGann: 37 (54, sort of, but really a one-shot TV movie)
* Eccleston: 41 (41)
* Tennant: 34 (39)
* Smith: 28 (31)
* Capaldi: 55

We don't know how old Hurt would have been when his face took over, but the CGI-doctored reflection in the short released earlier this year suggests he was much younger than Hurt actually is.

The main takeaway is that he's older at regen about as often as he's younger.

true,Veridas,eng-kent,The nutter round the corner.,"Then let us review what we know to be true.

This is a series of filters that have been ""requested"" to be put into place by the Prime Minister himself. Making no use of the usual legal channels or practices, there has been no opportunity for anyone in Parliament to officially vote for or against these measures and these measures are being put into place by the companies themselves. So what does this mean? Well practically it means that the filters are likely to be self-updating and quite effective insofar as an ISP's ability to filter. There's no point having a filter if it doesn't work, after all. Some ISPs may even go so far as to actively champion the success of their filters as selling points, but that remains to be seen.

Yes the filters can be turned off, but...here's the thing. The filters have been given the ability to block things that are...shall we say not entirely worth blocking? It seems like every other day a post in r/uk or r/ukpolitics tells of some website or group of websites blocked by the filters that doesn't need to be blocked or outright shouldn't be blocked. Why is this? Is it at attempt by the ISPs to say ""hey, we did what you asked Dave but we're not perfect"" by deliberately getting people to rally against them? Or was there more to David Cameron's initial request?

While we're on the subject of the request, it would be good to ask why this was touted as a pornography filter when it has become so much more. A comprehensive list or subjects that can be blocked can be either deliberately vague or straight-up confusing.  Such as ""Social Media"" (Interesting to note that nobody in Government gave a rat's arse about Social Media until it was used to spread news of, and organise, the...I believe it was 2011 riots) or in the instance of ""Obscene and Tasteless"" (According to whom, Mr Cameron?) or the simple straight-up sex education and search engines as described in the above link.

You see...these things cannot have been blocked simply because they seemed like good things to block as far as the ISPs are concerned. If that were the case then these filters would have been in place for years already. No, Mister Cameron himself must have, in some way, asked for each and every one of these subjects to be filtered. Whether directly or not.

Now, a politician deciding that a decent chunk of the population shouldn't be exposed to pornography could, with the right spin, be touted as noble, perhaps even caring. Social Media, on the other hand? Search Engines? Sexual Education? That's when we need to start asking questions. 

It doesn't matter that these filters can be turned off, the fact that Mister Cameron himself has decided that the country...no, HE needs to be able to filter them is bad enough. 

On top of that, I do ponder some parallels. Perhaps the Press Regulation charter. The Press, as I recall, proposed plans for self-regulation...these lofty ideas were tolerated for a time before being shot down in favour of the Government-approved Royal Charter.

Oh, by the way, anytime anything is ""Government-approved"" I find it healthy to take a closer look at it.

Now we have a similar situation. Cameron wants filters, the ISPs are, for now, applying their own filters but...here's the big question, the real slim shady of questions, as it were.

What's there to stop these filters from becoming mandatory now that they exist?

I mean...they were implimented without going through any Parliamentary channels, and we have been led to believe that they only exist at the merest behest of the highest political power in the land (an idea that I find to be frankly insulting) so what actual legal or corporate framework is there to stop Mister Cameron picking up the phone in...say...February and saying ""Oh, those filters? Turn them on for everybody, if you please""

Because if there is nothing to prevent it, then I for one plan to assume that it will...sooner or later...happen. 

Now you made the argument that the filters are controlled by ISPs but...they're not, really, are they? They're -maintained- by ISPs, but that isn't the same as control. In fact I'd argue that the fact that Mister Cameron has never tried to hide his involvement in this, has never tried to muddy the waters or act like this is anything other than his outright personal desire means that the ISPs are -not- controlling the filters, because if they were then why would they be in place? Filtering software for families and workplaces has been available for decades with fewer loopholes than these filters and with more experience behind them. Better yet, why is the ""someone think of the children"" argument so prevalent in the defence of the filters when not everyone affected will have children?

Are we expected to believe that we might search for something we do not want to see and then want to blame someone else for it? Have we truly reached a point where we are so collectively irresponsible that we cannot even take responsibility for being dumb enough to look up blue waffle or tubgirl or two girls one cup or whatever the next vomit-inducing web prank comes up next?

Even if you discount all this as paranoia or a guilty conscience, remember this. There is always a reason for everything in politics. If you are content to think that Dave is doing this for the good of the people then you go right ahead and think that, but I for one wouldn't trust him to use a toaster, much less start making ""requests"" about internet filtering.",0,1388192225,null,0,false,0,cebj1wn,t3_1ttaok,t1_cebj1wn,t1_cebaezt,null,1427963095,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

What is a cycle?

An interval of space or time in which one set of events or phenomena is completed.  

ie one regeneration.  A series of events.  Regeneration,  being alive,  repeat if &lt; 12 or you have a free turn card. 

Alternating current in most homes is 50/60 cycles per second.  One cycle is when the voltage goes all the way the middle of sine wave up to the top down to the bottom and back to the middle.  

Charge cycles on rechargeable batteries are taking the battery from dead to full charge back to dead.

There is scope for a missing regen for River, after the impossible astronaut episodes she regens, though I was under the assumption that was into Mels. The more likely route would be as mentioned by others in this thread, a post-library resurrection of sorts, I can't imagine that she could be Dalek'd and then recover into Mels later on. Also, Tasha didn't seem to recognise Clara when they were introduced. 

The problem is, Dr and Tasha seemed way too familiar with each other and trusting of each other for there to be no previous connection. The trick with the marshmallows as well, that seemed like something River would pull.

true,matcht,lfc12,,"Agger and Toure were fairly solid I thought, but Mignolet did have to make the most saves in the league during their run so obviously that is a problem. Agger made quite a few errors, notably vs Stoke, but on form I think he is excellent. Toure started the season as one of our best players, the move to a back 3 interrupted his form, but since his performance vs Hull he's not had a look in.

I have said it many times, but Skrtel's one of those defenders that is easily picked up on because he makes those last ditch blocks and what not, but that is because he makes so many mistakes before that. A good example is the play that led to Negredo running in on goal, but Skrtel making the block, that only happened because Skrtel let him wonder off. He is poor from set pieces, and looks the least assured of our defenders off the ball.

Also, he scored 3 own goals, if that was Cissokho the fans would have wanted him hanged. Not every own goal is a mistake, but the nature of Skrtel's show that he is prone to errors.

Sakho is our best defender, despite the 10 minutes of insanity vs City he was brilliant. He is rarely beaten in the air or one v one. His distribution is quick and measured. Part of why he struggled second half vs City was because Pellegrini must have realised he started most of our attacks, and Silva and Yaya pressed him much more. He has to play, the issue is his partner.

I'd like to see Agger given a chance, but I doubt Rodgers will make such a change against Chelsea. We need a settled defence, look what it has done for Arsenal. 

I'm not sure what to say about our general shittiness at defending set pieces, we were awful at them even with 3 centre backs on the pitch. Some blamed Reina last season, but different keeper same result. Gerrard was blamed sometimes because he was front post, but without him we've still struggled. Skrtel and Agger both struggle with them. GJ is also nowhere to be seen at corners usually. This needs to be looked at, we concede a set piece in almost every big game, that is a fucking severe handicap we give ourselves.",0,1388195536,null,0,false,0,cebk8xs,t3_1tugms,t1_cebk8xs,t3_1tugms,null,1427962537,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

You also said he liked early star trek from a campy perspective and this would have a similar aesthetic and would be equally campy.
here are some good scenes from the episodes:

first one of the best scenes ever in doctor who and possibly one of the most famous
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkelV2WUNdw

and this scene which is also pretty famous (sorry i couldn't find a clip)

[Outside the incubation room]

(Whilst Harry trims the ends of the wires to attach to the detonator, the Doctor moves amongst racks of jars filled with blobs at various stages of development. He places the explosives and attaches the battery pack to it.) 

SARAH: What's taking him so long? 

HARRY: It's a very delicate operation, Sarah. Still, he should have finished by now. 

SARAH: Doctor? Doctor, are you all right? 

(The Doctor comes out of the room with an angry embryo Dalek wrapped tightly around his neck.) 

DOCTOR: Sarah!


[Outside the incubation room]


SARAH: Get it off! Get it off! 

(Sarah and Harry pull at the gelatinous thing and finally get it off the Doctor's throat. Harry throws part of it back into the incubation room, the Doctor does the same with the remainder and closes the door. They move a little way down the corridor, and the Doctor holds the two wires. Then he hesitates putting them together to close the circuit and detonate the explosives.) 

SARAH: What are you waiting for? 

DOCTOR: Just touch these two strands together and the Daleks are finished. Have I that right? 

SARAH: To destroy the Daleks? You can't doubt it. 

DOCTOR: Well, I do. You see, some things could be better with the Daleks. Many future worlds will become allies just because of their fear of the Daleks. 

SARAH: But it isn't like that. 

DOCTOR: But the final responsibility is mine, and mine alone. Listen, if someone who knew the future pointed out a child to you and told you that that child would grow up totally evil, to be a ruthless dictator who would destroy millions of lives, could you then kill that child? 
SARAH: We're talking about the Daleks, the most evil creatures ever invented. You must destroy them. You must complete your mission for the Time Lords. 

DOCTOR: Do I have the right? Simply touch one wire against the other and that's it. The Daleks cease to exist. Hundreds of millions of people, thousands of generations can live without fear, in peace, and never even know the word Dalek. 

SARAH: Then why wait? If it was a disease or some sort of bacteria you were destroying, you wouldn't hesitate. 

DOCTOR: But I kill, wipe out a whole intelligent lifeform, then I become like them. I'd be no better than the Daleks. 

SARAH: Think of all the suffering there'll be if you don't do it. 

GHARMAN: Doctor! Doctor, I've been looking everywhere for you. Davros has agreed to our terms.
 
HARRY: He submitted? 

GHARMAN: He did, but he asked only one thing. That he might be allowed to address a meeting of all the Elite, scientific and military. 

DOCTOR: He's going to put a case? 

GHARMAN: Yes, but a vote will be taken. It's a foregone conclusion. There'll be a complete landslide against any further development of the Daleks. We've won. 

DOCTOR: I'm grateful to you, Gharman. More grateful than I can tell you.
 
GHARMAN: The meeting's about to begin. Will you come? 

DOCTOR: Yes.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I generally agree with what you said, but I'd also add one thing about some criticism I see.

Criticizing Jose for not winning games is totally unreasonable: our results have not been that bad (better than last year) and he has proven he can win in the long run.

However, I think criticizing him for his style of play is fairly reasonable. Different fans have different desires. In my time as a Chelsea fan I have seen us win every trophy worth mentioning. It's been fantastic. I would love to see us continue to win, but I would really, *really* prefer that we win playing a beautiful, attacking style.

I might be a bit more of a purist than some, but I get sort of sad watching us play these days. It's almost painful to see the talents of players like Mata and Hazard gimped by ultra-defensive, counterattacking tactics.

And that brings me to the last criticism of Mourinho: that he isn't playing the strengths of the squad. I haven't made up my mind about this, but its pretty hard to argue that talent isn't being wasted. I think truly great managers are versatile, and can adapt their style to fit their players. Jose seems to be forcing our square players into his round philosophy, so to speak. If this ends with wizards like Mata being swapped for ugly, functional players, I will be devastated.

---

Im rambling a lot too but the last thing I will say is that I think if Mourinho continues to play his very defensive style, and he fails to win a major trophy this year, he will struggle to keep his job. From what I can tell, Roman wants the team to play pretty. Winning may satisfy him, but who knows.

Tinfoil hat time! 

Comedy shows like Mock the Week, or HIGNFY are easy ways into politics. I bet there are plenty of people who don't really care for politics, but watch these current affairs stuff for laughs, and pick up stuff along the way. You also then have people who are somewhat interested in politics, who watch them for the political humour, but don't go any further into politics. This means that these comedians act as a gateway into politics, resulting in people becoming more cynical about politics because they actually know something about it.

By stopping these shows talking about politics, the government would essentially be closing off an easy way into politics, making it more difficult for people to get into the topic. This means less people being interested in politics as a whole, reducing criticism not directly through censorship, rather through making politics inaccessible. 

I'm probably talking out of my arse though, and it seems much more likely that politicians would want block any criticism instead of setting up some sort of doubleplusunbellyfeel against politics.

I agree with others that we're much less overtly enthusiastic and we rarely go over the top (compared to Americans who like to do things ""big""). I wish we could show more passion. But I think we're less sceptical when it comes to change and trying new things. However, we seem to blame and punish those who worked hard to get to a better place (particularly taxing the rich), rather than praise and admire them. And we (reluctantly) award/pity the lazy and the undeserving. This attitude has to stop. We (or our government at least) are too soft when it comes to treating and punishing the undeserving/criminals. Overall, I think we're less money hungry, but still as materialistic.

I also think we're less superficial, less stubborn and more worldly. Generally speaking, when harm comes our way, it has very little affect on our mindset, so I suppose you can say we're not as mentally sensitive/weak.

I think our humour is less profane and bawdy, and more dry and satirical. We're slightly more polite and orderly (not necessarily nicer, just show more manners/decorum).

As a counter point I would argue even with these television shows it is difficult to get into politics. You think you understand the situation watching these TV shows but then you realise every individual is coming from their own political standpoint. 

For example, HIGNFY with Ian Hislop. He owns a publication and is against press regulation. This isn't because he supports phone hacking but because he wants a free press which links in with his ownership of Private Eye. Even though he is on the BBC he expresses these political views. You might agree or disagree but either way it is a political view usually veiled behind sarcasm, satire, wit or comedy. 

What I'm trying to say is that everybody has a political angle on these shows. If you're switched on to politics you can quickly determine where people stand. However if you're new it can take considerable time to really appreciate what is being said amongst the satire and comedy. 

We need more political criticism, debate and comedy not less like Blunkett suggests. 

Even though you said tinfoil hat time I think it's an interesting point worth discussing more.

On the surface, most someone like Hislop is making jokes that anyone can get. This can hook someone who has no knowledge of politics whatsoever. Yes, it might take a long time to pick up on these political leanings and vested interests of the guests, but taking a long time to pick up politics is better than not picking up politics at all. 

Of course, it would be much better to do more to get people into politics. This is where I somewhat put on my tinfoil hat again. Getting people into politics would take cooperation from politicians. Something like a politics class in secondary school (simply describing how the institution works, nothing to do with the parties), or more politicians actually taking part in debate. However, MPs know that if people know more about politics (the institution, the politicians and their actions), it will be much more difficult to pull the wool over their eyes with rabble rousing and meaningless rhetoric. It is in their favour to keep people in the dark, and keep up as big a barrier as possible for people to enter politics. 

You could argue that politicians act like dickheads on programs like Question Time, or PMQs, or Daily Politics to keep p this barrier. By not answering questions properly, or shouted over each other like children, they turn people away from politics, instead of inviting them to ask questions and get involved. Of course, this could just be because politicians, or most of the current ones, are just dickheads, and they don't have an ulterior motive. Whatever the reasoning, the result is still the same. 

So, politicians won't cooperate and make it easier for people to get into politics, because they are the ones who lose out.

true,chamber37,,Joe le Tactics,"Alright... I've had enough of this.

People have been spouting this same line for the past three years now. It's REALLY getting old. As a long-term football AND business strategy, there is actually nothing wrong with buying talented, young, hungry players largely on the cheap and developing them at your elite standard youth academy (yes, Villa's youth academy is elite. In fact, last I heard, it was ranked #1 overall in the country, largely thanks to heavy investment over the past 6-7 years or so... coincidence, that).

Even if you just sell these talented players on to other clubs later, it still makes sense from both a football and business perspective. In fact, I'm pretty sure there is a certain successful North London club that has literally done that for the past 16 years or so, and are widely considered to be one of the most financially solvent clubs in the world. For years people said their players were ""not good enough"" and that the manager's constant failure to spend big and bring in big names, along with his repetition of his belief that they would eventually come good were problems. Last I checked, they had made one major signing -- using the accumulated wealth of years of frugality -- and were suddenly considered title contenders again. Funny how that works.

Seriously, dude. I get that you're upset and you want the best for the club... but you need to chill out a bit. Call me crazy but I reckon a guy with the business experience of Randy Lerner probably knows better what's best for my club in the long term than you do. Even if we assume that somehow you know better what the club needs from a footballing standpoint, will playing better football automatically make the club viable as a business in the long term? Of course not. If it did, we wouldn't be in this predicament in the fucking first place!

Besides, things are nowhere near as bad as people like to make them seem. If some people had their way, Lerner would fuck off tomorrow... and leave us crippled with debt. You know, the millions we owe his company? So yes. Let's keep criticising the guy who bankrolled arguably the most successful period our club has experienced in the past 30 years. Almost certainly in the past 15. Let's just run him out of town with all our protestations and bitching and moaning, because we'll obviously be so much better off when he takes all his millions with him.

Honestly, I prefer this to the early 2000s under Deadly Doug. At least there seems to be a plan at the moment.

Oh and stop making comparisons to the fucking Browns. The situations are COMPLETELY different, for so many reasons I don't even know where to start.",0,1388203067,null,0,false,0,cebmx7h,t3_1tue8h,t1_cebmx7h,t3_1tue8h,null,1427961290,6,false,avfc,t5_2s569,6

He's scored a few goals that way. Either way, I think that both he and Eriksen are more suited to playing behind the striker than they are where Sherwood has played them in the last few matches.

Name deals with the Doctor facing his mortality. Day is the Doctor handling guilt in a way only the Doctor can. Time is the culmination of those two and dealing with his impending death which is a direct consequence Day. Name introduces his death and offers a glimpse of his past, even a secret regeneration that is the embodiment of his guilt. Day deals with that guilt and the Doctors over come that. Time is very Matt Smith Doctor in that despite his dealing with the guilt in a very clever way, he still has to fatalistically face the consequences of his actions, ie the Time Lords want back in the universe and everyone else wants them to stay gone.

true,OldHighGallifreyan,wardr,Hurt,"I believe each incarnation of a Time Lord can age, just over hundreds of years. That's how they would normally live out their lives on Gallifrey. Any incarnation of a Time Lord would age and ""wear a bit thin"" and cause them to regenerate and do it all over again, 12 more times. This is how they live for so long. The Doctor on the other hand, runs into danger everywhere he goes. Radiation, falling from high places, gunshots among other things have forced him to regenerate. Other times, his bodies have lived long enough to show that they've aged in their physical appearance, and regenerated because of old age. This is what happened with the First Doctor. The Seventh Doctor aged and probably lived a few more hundred years after ""Survival"" (the last episode of Classic Doctor Who) as we can see from the beginning of ""Doctor Who: The Movie"". The Eighth Doctor also clearly aged from that time until his next on-screen appearance in ""The Night of the Doctor"". Also, in ""The Night of the Doctor"", we see Eighth regenerate into the War Doctor, blatantly younger than he was by the last days of the Last Great Time War. Each of them aged. It's just that, usually, the Doctor would have to be forced to regenerate before his aging got very noticeable. The Eleventh Doctor aged so much because he had a lot of time that spanned between seasons. At the beginning of series 5, the Doctor was around 907, as far as I can remember. At the end of series 6, the Doctor was at least 200 years older. I don't believe the Doctor's age difference between series 6 and 7 is ever stated, but after Amy and Rory's deaths in ""Angels Take Manhattan"", the Doctor takes a break and lives in a cloud for a few hundred years. In ""The Time of the Doctor"", the Doctor stayed in Christmas, defending it for 300 more years. That's probably the longest incarnation the Doctor's ever had. He also thought it was his last.

Though it may seem all Americans are gun-crazy, guns are a very hot political issue, and the majority of citizens are in favor of gun control. A large portion are in favor of extremely strict gun control. I think that's another example of TV-based stereotypes that aren't really as true in person as you might expect.

Look at the twin paradox.  Two twins are observed, one is stuck on Earth, the other is sent into space traveling at high speed.  Upon return to Earth, the twin from space has aged less than the twin from Earth.  When you think about it, the Twin Paradox applies pretty well to 11.  

The Doctor was in his early 900's when he regenerated into 11 and was somewhere in his 1200's at the time of DotD.  For pretty much the entirety of this time, 300 years, he was traveling through space and time at high speeds. In TotD, 11 is stationary on Trenzalore for 300 years and ages a ton.  The difference between the first 300 years and the latter 300 years is that the latter were spent stationary compared to 300 being spent wizzing through time and space at high speeds.  The twin paradox essentially has the same variables and same results, so I think it fits pretty well as an explanation.

I think it's a natural part of football. Guys like Ryan Giggs and Frank Lampard have gone through similar transitions in their career and Steven Gerrard will go through the same thing. I think the key is to trust Brendan Rodgers to rest/rotate Gerrard properly to preserve/extend his career as long as possible. I think if we find ourselves in the Champions League, we'll see less of Gerrard in Premier League matches and more of him the Champions League.

And, speaking of Champions League, if we get Champions League next season we are looking at multiple campaigns the following season: Premier League (getting at least 4th again), Champions League, FA Cup, League Cup.

Also, BR has done outstanding work with bringing in the right type of player in January. Since the arrival of Sturridge and Coutinho last season, our performances have dramatically gotten better and we were better positioned, considering the terrible start we had last season. We also have to factor in that our younger players have a full season of experience now, especially Sterling who has been performing outstandingly after given his chance against Tottenham, the performance of Flanno against Everton, and Joe Allen stepping up to fill in for the injured Gerrard.

true,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"I think I envy them in the sense that it's so *easy* for clubs like Chelsea, Man City, Real Madrid. Snap their fingers and the pocket books open up. It's sorta like Fantasy Premier League or Football Manager with an unlimited budget right? It's like a video game with all the cheat codes. But where's the challenge and the fun in that?

Take a look at Spurs. The money they got from Bale and spent on all those players simply increased the pressure on the players, the club, Andre Villas-Boas and now look at them: players finding it difficult to adjust to each other as a *team* and to life in England and the Premier League, the club struggling, manager sacked.

Think of the businesses that we support. We can easily sniff out the businesses - even businesses that we like - that have the big budget backing, the all-too-clever marketing campaign, etc. Think of the posts we upvote on Reddit. We can easily see the ones that are trying too hard, a bit too eager. Sure, those businesses and those posts on Reddit might get the success but, in my opinion, I'm much happier when a business battles from the ground up, or when a post on Reddit that started so innocently gets a couple thousand upvotes.

Sure, it'd be nice to snap our fingers and have the money of Chelsea, Man City, Real Madrid... but that instant influx of money won't guarantee success (see: Spurs) and if it does bring success, it would feel nice but, I would imagine, also a bit hollow, empty. There's a sort of coldness when a big-money player scores a goal, we think, ""Of course, that's what you're *supposed* to do. That's your bloody job."" But when young Jon Flanagan of Liverpool works his way into the senior squad and scores a goal... isn't it just *that much* sweeter?

No doubt, FSG aren't financially struggling by any stretch. But they're not foolishly waving around the money either (at least not anymore! Haha). They're not perfect but I feel as if they're trying to do it the right way: learning as much as possible about the city, respecting the history as much as possible, wisely managing the money, building from the bottom up, etc. etc.

Yes, I *do* envy clubs with seemingly infinite amounts of money. But, push comes to shove, I think I'd rather have it the way we're doing it now.

When the Sontarans, Daleks, Cybermen or Stone Angels are the focus of an episode, they are fearsome foe that the Doctor can only triumph against at the last minute.  When they are not the focus of the episode, they are easily handled.

When the Doctor needed information from the Cybermen in GMGTW, he easily blew up a Cyber space station deep in Cyber controlled space just for shits and giggles.  The Daleks at Trenzalore are defeated by regeneration energy sent from Gallifrey - if that works, why the hell didn't the Time War end much sooner?  The Weeping Angels - the most fearsome new villain of the reboot - defeated with a mirror.  They'll never have the same impact again.

I also wasn't really impressed with his handling of Tasha and the Church.  What the hell was the nudity for?  The bed/altar?   The sexual innuendo?  It served absolutely no purpose to the story, it wasn't even really that amusing, why was it there?  What was it for?  

Moffat's era since being showrunner has been one that is more style over substance.  This episode pretty much underscored that.  It was a checklist of loose ends combined with a checklist of fan-popular show elements combined into a fast paced and energy filled smorgasbord.  

All that said, as long as we can accept that Doctor Who is now being produced to clearly appeal to a wider audience, I think the episode was enjoyable.  But the problem is that by appealing to a wider audience, you are going to somewhat alienate some.  I think that's where the complaints are coming from.

I like Smith, took a while for me to grow into him but I think he did a very good job of playing the Doctor, even when the writing didn't necessarily support him.  I also like the fact that Moffat has tried to create the sort of long-view story arcs that you can follow without being completely lost just by missing a single episode.

I do think some of the substance has been lost though.  My favorite episodes are pretty much all from Tenant's run.  Blink, Family of Blood, Girl in the Fireplace, Midnight, Turn Left etc.  Those were all standalone episodes (well, maybe not Turn Left), and very heavily story- and character-driven.  I kind of miss those.  The most interesting stories from Eleven's run to me are Vincent and the Doctor, and the Doctor's Wife - those were sort of in the same vein as being not-just-about-the-doctor.

TotD is pretty much the episode I would have expected given the style of story telling we've seen with Eleven, so from that perspective, it worked for me.",0,1388213718,null,0,false,0,cebqc84,t3_1tu1ov,t1_cebqc84,t3_1tu1ov,null,1427959624,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

I'd love to see azpilicueta on his natural side for once and watch cole play too. and david luiz seems to be passing very fluently from the back. ive been noticing that cahill seems rather hesitant to play the long passes and it would be interesting to watch luiz play again. ramires's suspension is a cause of concern as hes been our bulwark in an otherwise underperforming midfield. i hope to see mikel and lampard in there. 3 man midfield with mikel essien and lampard doesnt sound too good so i expect us to line up in our usual 4 2 3 1.
 And in our attacking midfield we are simply spoilt for choice. i'd love to see schurrle starting the game as hes confident in taking on the defender and beating him and crosses and shoots well. willian has been impressive with his work rate but I'd rather have schurrle start. 
As much as i hate to be typing this, i would like Oscar to start ahead of Mata in the CAM position after his tremendous show against swansea. he wasnt hesitant to tackle and won the ball on several occasions. Mata (sadly) hasnt been as influential as he was last season and i do hope he gets back to his playmaking best soon.

Looking back, I feel as if Suarez and his agent wanted to challenge the resolve of the new(ish) American owners, try to see if they'd budge, fold, cave. But they stood strong and in the end it worked out and I think a lot of us supporters respect them for that.

He abandoned his family for this idealism. He loved and lost companions and family but he never returned not once ( unlike in the new series) .

The loneliness of the last of a species is assumedly incomprehensible because here aren't even people you don't like, just no one who might understand your past ,think in a vaguely similar manner etc. ",0,1388214951,null,0,false,0,cebqnu8,t3_1tv3p4,t1_cebqnu8,t3_1tv3p4,null,1427959474,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,Fishbowl_Helmet,tardis,TARDIS,"&gt;He carries the sorrow of his actions during the Time War with him wherever he goes. And, significantly, the Doctor is alone. The last of his kind.

This is a new conceit in the relaunched show. The Doctor is also seemingly alone because of his age, that he basically can't age, at least not on a human time scale, and can't enjoy growing old with someone he loves. It isn't his sorrow that makes him relatable, rather him having emotions. Like with music, if you play the same note over and over it becomes routine and boring. Like the Doctor striking the ""I'm the last of my kind"" and ""I killed them all"" over and over and over for the last 8 years gets to be routine and boring. 

&gt;These flaws are what make his character relatable. They give him depth and complexity.

They're not the only things that make him relatable, as they're not his only flaws. Depth and complexity are good, of course, but he's become a two or three trick pony. He's either sad because he killed all the Time Lords or he's manic and running because something exciting is happening. That is not depth.

&gt;In the last few episodes, we've seen the end of this Doctor. He has overcome his flaws. It turns out he has nothing to regret from the Time War. He rescued Galifrey and is no longer the last of his kind.

He's only overcome the need to strike the same note over and over. The Time Lords aren't all dead so he can stop harping on that already. That's great. Now he'll face the trials and tribulations and philosophical questions of whether to bring the Time Lords back into the universe or leave them elsewhere. That will be a lot more complex and interesting journey than being reminded that the main character of this amazing show is a genocidal madman. So many fans of Classic Who just can't buy in to that whole thing. The Doctor would never, ever have done something like that. Now, as it turns out, he didn't.

&gt;And in the town of Christmas, for the first time, the Doctor stayed. He disregarded his need to run and instead dedicated centuries of his life to the protection of a small village.

In dialogue the Doctor says he finally found a place that needed him to stay, for the first 300 years he had no means of escape (at least, no TARDIS handy), and he literally couldn't leave. He had to defend the town of Christmas from the threat of the aliens and defend the only means his fellow Time Lords had to reenter the universe.

&gt;Without his flaws, the Doctor is unattainable, a godlike being of unimaginable goodness.

Again, carrying guilt over the genocide, or attempted genocide, of two species isn't his only flaw. His need to keep moving isn't a flaw, it's the basic premise of the show. A vastly ancient alien with two hearts that can survive death steals a time machine and sets off to explore the universe... go.",0,1388215062,null,0,false,0,cebqov9,t3_1tv3p4,t1_cebqov9,t3_1tv3p4,null,1427959460,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Edit: since I've got the top comment here and I seem to be mistaken, I should correct myself.  

The pods are not an alternate form for the standard Dalek armored vehicle that we think of as a Dalek. They are instead a vehicle piloted by several Daleks together. We have in fact seen other vehicles of such a nature before. It's still rather redundant since the Dalek itself is essentially a battle mech, so this is a battle mech piloted by other battle mechs.
