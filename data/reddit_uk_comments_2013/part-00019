Now im gonna discuss your picture as if we did have a preferred XI currently. 

* When we do a similar formation to this our two CM's are more side by side then they are parallel.

* When we brought Dembele in he was a CAM with a high tackle ratio, so we made him a CM. I have a feeling we will do the same with Holtby and rotate him with Dembele/Parker as his tackles per game are also very high for a CAM.

I listed 8 points after saying I was going to list 2? How horrible of me, and you say I'm a royal douche. :)

Yes, I can say that. I've seen him play at Schalke and he seems like a really good fit in the squad. I was skeptical about Sigurdsson joining, but I was happy Dempsey did at the price he did. We got to fourth without Holtby, true, but couldn't we have been in third too? We've thrown away a lot of points because of a lack of creativity up front and Holtby seems like a solution to that.

I'm glad you agree with my line-up, even though the arrows might be a little simplistic and that the arrows for Dembele might be covering too much ground (as someone mentioned), but he DOES cover all that ground and he pops up in those positions.

The NHU's landmark series like Planet Earth, Blue Planet and Africa are only possible due to the significant funding afforded by the National Geographic network in the US (which is why the episodes are 50 minutes with a 10-minute BBC-only behind-the-scenes segment) and so are encumbered by commercial constraints.

Believe it or not my parents have no idea on the danger they are in as they let it go so low.

It seems there is a law that means we can extend for 50 years this seems like our only option.
What is likely to happen is under law we can get the extension for the fifty years.  However the landlord writes a new lease that begins after the 14 years are up. The rates the landlord gets to set and although this is bad he cannot set a ridiculous rate as you just go to tribunal and show that rates in the area are much lower.
I've spoken to solicitor about the likely hood of landlord throwing them out but have been told its highly difficult and unlikely as the courts would look at the circumstances and realise he's just trying to cash in.

true,__CanExplainThat,null,null,"This is a great explanation of how guns are seen as necessary to American life, the whole ""if we all had guns, we'd be safer"" argument, for rural areas.  Thank you. 

My natural question is, whether people think it might be possible to separate rural and urban America.  I know it sounds unrealistic, but if we can look up where preventable gun crimes happen the most, and if they are in urban areas, impose stricter gun laws there (perhaps this is already the case, but just on paper), more police presence there, and then leave the rural areas alone.  Of course it's near impossible to try to control gun flow between rural and urban America, but if this was possible in an ideal world, would we do it?  Can this our long-term goal for the gun issue in the U.S.?  

About assault weapons (I don't know the real meaning of this, so let's just say weapons more powerful/faster/etc. than licensed hand guns, shotguns, and hunting rifles) - I think these should be banned and the U.S. should just unequivocally work hard to get rid of them.  If there is a black market, than the gov't should do its utmost to quash it.  The reason I say this is because even if police may be outnumbered in general, in the case of bank robbers going into a bank with ""assault weapons and armor piercing rounds,"" in this situation I think it's important that the police are able to outgun people using legal weapons.  Police should not be facing weapons/armor better than theirs.  This is the road to Mexico-like violence.  

I think if we look to the next 10-20 years, not the next 1-2 years, some sort of radical gun control/gun culture shift is possible.  If the purpose is self-defense, perhaps stricter laws on lethal ammunition, and let rubber bullets proliferate?  Let tasers become the next generation handgun?  For defense against animals, expand the market for animal repellents, like tranquilizers, or I don't know, something analogous to chili powder vs. elephants (supposed to extremely effective) for the coyotes, like pepper spray for animals.

From above, regarding the UK: 
&gt;But it also means that ""the establishment"" can have more power in putting forward their version of ""what is fair"" and social change can be slow.

True, but social change can be just as slow in the US because defenders of the status quo can hang on to the letter of the law, as we see today.  Even if 60, 70% of the population believes we should change an amendment, unless we get a 67% majority in both houses at the same time, it stays, and social change has to wait.  

As an enthusiast of Chinese history, I've come to think of many non-US, developed-economy societies (like Europe) as more ""Confucian"" where being ""reasonable,"" ""moral,"" and things like ""shame"" can direct conduct, whereas the US is very [Legalist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legalism_%28Chinese_philosophy%29) - only the law matters, and you can fuck everything else.  
 
I'm starting to digress, but with a more Confucian way of thinking, you can very efficiently control a population to act more reasonable, so most of the time, people are reasonable in a very good, constructive way - but, change can be slower since you have to change people's thinking and morals.  With a Legalist culture, people don't care about reasonableness, and it can be very inefficient with the ""edge-cases that appear ridiculous or counterproductive"" as you exactly say.

When Blair did the solo question time he was pulled up for it by a woman complaining about it - it was quite famous at the time.

I got an iPhone 4s because of their ability to work in the USA as well as here. That way when I go back for a bit I can just plug in a pay-as-you-go sim and it all works just fine. 

As for here, I use O2. I bought the iPhone outright so that it was unlocked, then did a pay monthly with O2 that gave me unlimited texts, 300 anytime minutes and 300 O2 to O2 minutes, and 500 gb data (more than I ever need, but then I don't talk on the phone a lot). It cost me £16.50.

As a side note I went in to have a sim switched around and the guy said he could lower my costs to £13.50 if I signed up for a 2 year contract. so of course I did. Works well for me and is probably the cheapest contract around.

I've had no issues with O2. They've always been very helpful in store. I'd recommend them. Good luck!

true,busstopboxer,null,null,"I think that, even though we're clearly not playing it yet, all the transfer market moves we've made since AVB's appointment point towards us putting together a squad capable of playing in the particular 433 system he favoured at Porto.

We've signed Lloris, a world-class sweeperkeeper who can well cover a high defensive line.

We've signed Vertonghen, a highly technically competent centre back who's capable of being involved in retaining and circulating possession as well as breaking forward into the midfield to support a high-possession strategy.

We gave every impression that we were willing to let Dawson leave the club, a player not particularly compatible with this system — a move which was only scrapped in light of Kaboul's long-term injury lay off. This idea that wasn't considered a good fit is supported by his being largely confined to the bench until Gallas' injury necessitated his involvement beyond cup matches, despite him being fully fit since ealier September and Kaboul being out.

We've looked at loaning out Livermore to get experience, the lesser of three DMs, because we only need two for that role in this system. This has only been stopped from happening by injuries, first to Parker, now to Sandro.

We focused our summer recruitment on the midfield areas in which we were least able to meet the requirements of this system, i.e. a creative circulator of the ball (Moutinho) and a forward driving ball carrier (Dembele/Sigurdsson). Picking up the first one of these fell through at the last minute but remains a long-term target. I think the plan, even supposing Moutinho signed, was to give Huddlestone the chance to prove he could be the back up for such a role this season, a job he's unfortunately shown he isn't up to within a dynamic, high-energy system.

This, combined with the fact we aren't in a position to get Moutinho in yet, is why I think we've signed Holtby now — it doesn't seem to get said an awful lot, but I think he's a very similar player to Moutinho, just somewhat less advanced and experienced. I think bringing his transfer forward to this window was always on the cards once it became clear Moutinho wasn't going to be coming in any time soon — it's Livermore's lack of a loan move that's been affected by Sandro's injury, not Holtby's arrival.

Further forward, we already had three players in the squad who can play as wingers in Bale, Lennon and Townsend, but Bale was our only player capable of playing a narrower, goal-scoring inside forward role, as the system also requires. We tried for a forward who could play wide and narrow, because we like a bit of versatility, but the preferred option, Willian, was found to cost too much. So instead we signed a proven Premier League goal-scoring inside forward for a very decent price: Dempsey.

Finally, we needed a goalscorer who can play up top on his own and bring the wingers and those driving forward from midfield into play, so we made sure the Adebayor deal went permanent and looked again at signing other forwards who could do the same (Damaio etc.). This proved further than we were willing to go financially, bearing in mind we thought we were going to be spending 25-odd million on Moutinho up until the final moments of the summer window, so we settled on giving Defoe a chance at proving himself up to the job instead.

I think the way we use Holtby over the coming months will show us whether all this is really the case or whether I'm just talking shit.",0,1359451218,null,0,false,0,c85jms7,t3_17gmvy,t1_c85jms7,t3_17gmvy,null,1431116650,7,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,7

1) Our biggest issue has not been talent. It's not that we have crappy players anywhere (let's put Torres aside, we do have Ba now), it's that we just go blank. Like we go what the hell. Bringing me to....


2) We seem to perform poorly against teams that press us and give us less time on the ball. Swansea, West Ham, Club World Cup etc. When clubs give us space, which happens when the club is not super ultra motivated to chase us down, then we do PHENOMENALLY better (think Arsenal, Aston Villa, every other club we've beaten the shit out of). This, I think is because the players haven't had time to just settle down to a style of play, absorb situations on the training field etc. 

3) This will change when we have more time between matches, Rafa has been consistently whining about there's no time in training sessions since he gets such less time between matches: 

Illustration: If we play mid-week, then we get to train maybe 3-4 times a week, i.e. if we play on Sunday - then no heavy training on Monday, training on Tuesday (prep for match on wednesday), Play game on Wednesday, no heavy training on Thursday, training on Friday (prep for match on Saturday/Sunday), training/match on saturday/sunday. 

Now let's say no match on wednesday + matches are Saturday one week and Sunday the next week, this is what happens.

Match on Saturday, no heavy training on Saunday, Training on Monday, Training on Tuesday, break on Wednesday, Training on Thursday (preparation for match on Saturday), Light training for match on Saturday, Saturday (SUPER fresh). 

I'm a lawyer, and I feel the pinch of working continously without getting a single day off, one can only imagine how they feel being in such a high pressure, high intensity profession.

4) Rafa will get to work on different situations and getting the team gelling together properly. And players who haven't had a single day to just breathe will get to absorb the pressure (think Oscar, Hazard etc).

Science as been protected to a degree, as Prof. Moriarty admits when asked to argue the other side. But given everyone else is fighting for the same cash you need present a strong justification for that protection, and possible long-term benefits &amp; idealism just isn't going to cut it. Its all about supporting the vital industries and fields of research, and showing the practical application of that research.

But I think the thing that bothers me the most about this is the idea that the way the system used to work was 'better'.

You know all the amazing research that gets reported on, the great-sounding ideas, which then disappear never to be heard of again? That's my job; I get thrown the ideas to develop into things people might want. Three years of this have turned me into an utter cynic; the vast majority of the research I get asked to look at turns out to be garbage. These ideas which gain so much media attention generally have little actual substance; they are used by the scientists to support the next grant application, then get quietly dropped.

I used to attend international engineering research conferences during my time as a uni research associate, and the amount of rubbish there, at an *international conference*, was staggering. It was plain that a lot of people just come up with a paper to justify a jolly to what ever country the conference is hosted in.

If we're to finish in the top four then we need to get eliminated from the Europa as soon as possible. I think we've played more games than any other team this season (in fact that must be the case, considering Super Cups, Community Shield and so forth) and yet our squad is one of the weakest amongst our fellow challengers.

Our players desperately need a rest and that's not happening because a) we're continuously playing weekend-midweek-weekend and b) our squad isn't good enough to bring players in that can allow those like Mata, Lampard and Ramires a rest they so desperately need. In Lampard and Ramires' case, there is literally no-one to replace them at the moment.

In Britain there was a liberal open attitude to discovery; men were allowed to come up with ideas and share them, yes turn them in to businesses if they wanted but also to invent things like calculus, to discover that we need air to breath, to understand that things are made up of basic elements that can be categorised, as unique, by their weight.

To be quite frank; this idea that some bureaucrat should dictate the future of research towards economic benefit shows how pathetic the top down leadership of this government is. You have the **liberal** democrats and free market conservatives; people that will argue to the end of the earth about the importance of liberalism implementing top down, hierarchical constraints on institutions that success can be directly traced to their freedom. This shows, not only a lack of leadership, but a lack of ideals; they are completely incompetent because they don't even practice their own philosophy.

What you do is this:

   - This should be a pretty short list because while many of us might have loads of acquaintances, few of us have that many closely-trusted friends. The shorter this list, the better - if it gets long, it gets difficult to police.
 - Set it up so your entire Facebook profile is invisible to everyone - or maybe if you want to appear like you really exist, nail it so that all your friends can see basic information but nothing else. Then start opening things up to ""trusted friends"".
 - You can set it so your posts, by default, are only visible to a particular group. Set this to ""trusted friends"".

While obviously you're technically correct, this is a very narrow regressive tax. It makes tax avoidance even for the poor very easy/trivial (which is the point!).    

I would argue that this tax is even less ""unfair"" than the tax on cigarettes. Because with cigarettes, there aren't too many alternatives (and many of them are taxed also). In this case there are MANY alternatives.    

In general your analysis of the situation assumes that tax avoidance won't occur.

It is hardly surprising that people with wealthier parents can afford better education and will be brought up by parents who understand the values of working hard and pushing hard to get ahead in whatever field they choose to be in - after all, the parents are simply installing their own morals into their children.

It is equally not the fault of such children that they lack competition for the jobs they go after because people are leaving the state schooling system barely able to hold down a job flipping burgers unless they go to university to fix the inherent flaws in the secondary school system.

The problem isn't that a narrow pool of people rise to the top - that will always happen in any pyramidic system.

The problem more often than not is that the poor performance at the bottom of society is institutionalised and reinforced - often by those who profess to abhor it.

How do we get more people out of secondary education able to go to universities, run businesses and succeed in whatever field they want to specialise in? We improve the education system - and that needs a huge shake up and the introduction of the very things that drive almost everything else to improve - creative destruction.

I will never support the argument put forward that politics needs a diverse representation of people, any more than I think any other industry does. You want the best of the best. End of.

Yes he is ready to be at the Chelsea bench and slowly start to get games and experience when the manager has a chance to put on youth, even if not ready for that then he is ready for loan with a Premiership club. The guy is the real deal and if you watch just 3 games of him you will understand why.

I have watched Chalobah play for a long time and he has been one of my favorite youth prospects for a while. Seems to be the typical modern center back who apart from defending well, is skilled with the ball at his feet, has a good shot and very good long range/short range passing and can do the David Luiz/John Terry runs into the other half. His distribution is fast which Chelsea are aiming for.

Not only that he can play at Holding midfield very well too. If you like David Luiz then you will love Chalobah because he even makes less mistakes (granted at a lower level), he puts his job first and then provides the flair which is very nice to see. Also he can score goals and pretty decent ones at that too.

Here again this is all speculation from the german media, it may be true, but then again, Bayern didn't want to sign another big transfer, because of the Martinez deal.

I spend a lot of times in german transfer gossip pages, like transfermarkt.de, and their mostly well informed users, would love to see him at the club, but say that he would be too expensive. Bayern doesn't have a problem to pay 30.000.000 euro right away for a player, but it isn't a sheik club, so 48.000.000 euro for Suarez is just a little bit too much.

I just hope that he stays, I don't really know what happens if Bayern accept the exit clause, what will happen? Could Suarez still chose playing for Liverpool?

Is it really surprising that people who are good at networking and socialising end up meeting more people and as a consequence of that are going to be more likely to be in a position to exploit those friendships?

A person with 100 associates/friends is going to have a greater chance of being introduced to someone they can impress and seek work from than a person with 2 friends.

Simple maths.

It's worth noting though, that networking is not a skill limited to rich white people - it's a skill that crosses all social and economic barriers. Some people are good at it and some (myself included) are pretty bloody awful at it.

Whether you can then turn the ability to socialise with influencers into something of benefit to you is a separate but vital skill, and does somewhat thin out the talent pool to those who come from backgrounds where the value of a good education was understood and invested in.

Finally, we are seeing the first of the ""new breed"" educated children entering the work place.  It turns out that pushing everyone into university and teaching them that there is no such thing as winners and losers has created (broadly) a generation of unproductive wastrals.  The evidence?  Employment is up, but GDP is down.  That means we're doing less with the same resources.

It's worth remembering that this is not a crisis of capitalism, we have not had any capitalism.  We have a crisis of corporatism, where the government involves itself with selected few businesses.  Those businesses then don't have to compete in the market, they have to compete for influence with the government.  Observe the rise in lobbying and revolving door employment.

All of those big mistakes have a price, and the crappy growth is it.  Credit and capital that should have been freed for use by growing industries are instead being sucked up by the government and held in the twitching corpses of banks, with a reduced pool of entrepreneurs because the government has beaten any thought of innovation out of them.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Minimum wage in the UK is a slave wage and I dread to think what life is like on it.

Quite good, I lived 3 years in the UK with fellow Eastern Europeans, and as long as people live in a houseshare, they can work as a waiter and (with overtime, of course) party, buy designer clothes and even save money for buying an apartment at home. Not London of course, London is stupid expensive, but say Birmingham. 5 people to a house our whole rent was like 250 per person and that was including utilities. My minimum wage friends were having all the luxuries: a car, LCD TV, iPod, going out to middle-class pubs not lower-class dens, designer clothes, even eating out once in a while. All the things that normally do not belong to the lowest social class. Compared to Eastern Europe everybody felt rich and they still saved money after these expenses.

And the white-collar salary I earned felt like heaven, buying a decent car, a 6 years old Honda Civic VTEC for 3000 quids was like 6 weeks of my salary? I felt silly rich. I wish I could make as much now here in Austria with as low taxes as back in the UK.

Of course the UK minimum wage  is not suitable for renting a whole apartment and having kids and suchlike, but nobody I know ever intended such a thing on a minimum wage job, they were all like make some normal career and position in life first, then have kids. Everybody understood the minimum wage is the lowest social position so they must get out of it before they have kids, as it would not be responsible to have kids on that position. I never understood the notion that a minimum wage should be high enough to be able to support a family on.

Australia has a quota system, so many immigrants a year and no more. On top of that, they have a points system and multiple requirements before you can enter. Basically they want 18-25 years olds, degree educated, certified English speakers - i.e. people who will become useful members of the working community, contribute via taxes to the country they live in, and benefit everyone. This is in no way ""racist"", it's just a common sense solution to the problem of immigration.

In UK, we just open the floodgates, we let anyone in (or to be more accurate, we don't send anyone home once they've sneaked in via Chunnel or boat), regardless of whether they can speak a word of the language, and whatever fucked up morality and religion they bring with them. Then they just jump straight to the head of the queue for priority housing, child benefit, all the other benefits (despite never having paid a penny into the system) and are sitting pretty for life.

And our ""solution"" to this problem of our own making ? Put up posters to convince foreigners rain isn't the most ideal weather system !

Where the fuck did we go wrong ?

EDIT:

Wow, so much hate ? Does reality hurt that much ?

Seems like the main objections are :-

1 - We are in the EU. Okay fine, maybe we shouldn't be. France, Italy, Germany, Switzerland and Sweden ALSO have large support for limiting immigration, many nations are feeling the effect. And in any case, since when was Africa, Asia and the Middle East in the EU ? Across the EU, of the approx. 10% foreign born nationals, 2/3rds come from OUTSIDE THE EU. So either way, whatever ""freedom of movement"" agreements we have to respect, there's still another 31 million people to whom those regulations never applied.

2 - We are paying some kind of ""penance"" for the British Empire. Funny, Spain and Portugal also colonized large parts of the world a couple of hundred years earlier - I don't see them having the same kind of guilt trip. The Vikings colonized Britain and the US in the 11th and 12th centuries, I don't see 390 million people having a valid claim to move to Norway. Seriously, the fact that we colonized somewhere in the past means nothing, and is a ludicrous argument.

You'll note I'm not some crazy who wants to BAN immigration - I'm just saying that unless you are bringing something of value to the country you intend to settle in, you are simply allowing regional problems to shift to other areas.

&gt;It's fairly easily explained: there is no austerity; and yet the PR is that there is austerity. Government spending has not been cut at all. It has merely increased slower than previously expected.

No austerity? My, all those hundreds of thousands of people being cut from the Police, armed forces and NHS must have all left at the same time because they hated their jobs.

There is austerity, but the governments' bill has risen in the form of welfare after putting so many people directly out of work, and a bunch of people whose jobs depended on the first group of people being in employment being put out of work as a result. 

&gt;Combined with that, we bailed out a load of zombie banks, bondholders and shareholders by printing a load of new money.

No argument. We did have the opportunity to keep the banks' bollocks in a vice, but that opportunity passed and the sector hasnt been regulated yet - allegedly it will happen in 2019 (because those poor little dears need almost a decade to get their house in order to avoid it).

&gt;Finally, we are seeing the first of the ""new breed"" educated children entering the work place. It turns out that pushing everyone into university and teaching them that there is no such thing as winners and losers has created (broadly) a generation of unproductive wastrals. The evidence? Employment is up, but GDP is down. That means we're doing less with the same resources.

AHAHAHAHA are you serious?

Your ""evidence"" of a supposedly failed educational system is actually indicative of systemic under-employment. Either as a result of people taking on more part time work instead of one full time job, reducing average productivity; or because those jobs that are actually created are not of equal or greater revenue generators than the jobs they replace - like replacing a job of a dockyard welder with a guy doing the internal company mail.

As an aside, this prolonged recession is causing a wasted instead of wastrel generation - lots of my friends with bachelors, masters and phds are leaving the UK and going overseas instead, tired of being underemployed in situations where their studying isnt being used. Myself, when I finish my degree I'm headed straight overseas because fuck staying in this place and being paid a pittance for my skills.

&gt;It's worth remembering that this is not a crisis of capitalism, we have not had any capitalism. We have a crisis of corporatism, where the government involves itself with selected few businesses. Those businesses then don't have to compete in the market, they have to compete for influence with the government. Observe the rise in lobbying and revolving door employment.

You're sort of right here - I'd view it as principally crony capitalism instead of corporatism, but either way large companies have far too much influence and very little potential of being held to account. The revolving door between government and corporations is particularly disgusting, especially [when you read up on the free schools idea.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2010/oct/27/michael-gove-adviser-free-schools-contract)

&gt;All of those big mistakes have a price, and the crappy growth is it. Credit and capital that should have been freed for use by growing industries are instead being sucked up by the government and held in the twitching corpses of banks, with a reduced pool of entrepreneurs because the government has beaten any thought of innovation out of them.

I'd say that its more the banks not wanting to lend because they wouldnt make as high a profit margin on the loans as before, and the government not stepping in to hold a gun to their head to lend, or create their own bank to lend to business. In the middle of last year we saw Vince make a lot of bluster about creating such a bank, but since then I havent heard anything of it: the banks still refuse to lend, the government is still ineffectual, and the country slowly starves itself to death saving money for a glorious future that gets further away by the minute.",0,1359464319,null,0,false,0,c85l4l1,t3_17gm12,t1_c85l4l1,t1_c85knr2,null,1431117420,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

The harsh reality is the best we can hope for this season is a top 4 finish and even that is looking nervous given Spurs' performance this year and the rabbit that Everton have pulled out of the hat this season. Anything else will be a very nice to have.

The team is not gelling and the club is in a state of confusion. We are hot and cold and have been struggling to win simple games at the Bridge (QPR, Swansea)

Which is another way of saying that something's absolute worth is irrelevant when looking at consumer behaviour.     

The problem HMV has/had is *not* that people can copy MP3s are near-zero cost, the problem HMV has is that legal MP3, Radio, and DRM music stores are offering a more convenient product (e.g. ""buy from the toilet seat"") and often at better value (cheaper, recommendations, ""cloud,"" search, etc).    

But that doesn't mean HMV cannot survive. They just have to pivot. CDs, DVDs, and BluRays are in decline and look set to continue that trend near indefinitely. So what can HMV sell that *isn't* in decline?    

Better question: How can they make coming into a HMV store have, within its self, value?    

For example a lot of people will purposely visit the Apple store even when they have no intention of buying anything. It is ""fun."" They want to ""play"" with the gadgets. Can HMV reproduce this?    

HMV will never beat [legal] digital in terms of convenience. It might even never beat it on raw price. But it could potentially beat it on ""value"" (value being more than just ""price""). They can also pivot their strategy and sell products easier to value-add (e.g. a product staff can be more involved in selling).

true,confusedpublic,null,null,"&gt;it seems a bit weird to be having a dig at Israel when they've just had elections that weaken Netanyahu's position and will hopefully halt the settlements in east Jerusalem.

I took that to be, more or less, the point of the cartoon. It's asking whether the previous policies will be continued given the results of the election. Combined with a statement about those policies: that Israel/Netanyahu has ""cemented peace"" through the blood of Palestinians (understood as their death, subjugation, the wall etc).

It's rather ridiculous to claim that *any* depiction of blood with Jews/Israel is necessarily alluding to the blood libel idea, *especially* when Israel is in the midst of some sort of war with certain people from/based in/claiming to represent Palestine which has resulted in the death of countless Palestinians (and Israelis of course, but it's not the Israelis killing the Israelis).

true,JB_UK,null,null,"&gt; you have very little choice in voting on the basis of class, seen as politicians mostly come from a very narrow section of society. 

I agree, but the article does not follow the same bipartisan line, instead using this subject to structure a completely partisan attack on the Tories. And this is a reflection of the rubbish state of British politics, which is focussed not around discussion of ideas, but rather delegitimization and demonization of the people who propose them. 

For instance, maybe we could say that HS2 represents Cameron's plutocratic attitudes, he is spending tens of billions to find a way for him and his mates to get around more quickly, and trampling on the birthright of the people, the natural landscape, how disgraceful! Except when you realize that HS2 is a very long term project, which is the baby of Andrew Adonis, who was brought up in care. Now, perhaps it's the good of the mass of the British people being held back by dreadful Tory landowners in Oxfordshire! Can't we just stick with discussion of the merit of the idea on its own basis? It's hardly unprecedented for a country to have a party which is pro business, we don't need to explain it away with this sort of cheap hackery.

Having said that, beyond the use of these arguments to demonize , there clearly is a problem with British politics. I'd break it down into three categories: 

* tendency for wealthy people to get into power

* tendency for people from political families to get into power (and that includes influential positions like George Monbiot's, whose grandfather was a conservative MP)

* tendency for candidates with limited or self-limited ideological positions to get into power

Those are structural problems, and they require careful reforms. For instance, having a more proportional electoral system would allow a turnover of political parties, and reduce the two party effect, and having primaries might reduce the power of local and national elites to select the right sort of candidate behind closed doors. But these partisan attacks on the basis of class do nothing, except degrade the quality of political discussion even further.

true,Clbull,eng-Bristol,Bristol,"If the levy is put in place on retail sales, it would put retailers if anything under obligation to raise their prices. I dunno how or whether it would apply to suppliers though.

I can imagine it would raise funds but probably not the £1.1 billion promised. It depends on just how elastic the demand is for sugary soft drinks like Coca Cola, Fanta, Pepsi, etc (I imagine they are pretty damn elastic) and how well economic models can predict any change from a 20p per litre rise in taxation.

This raises a number of questions:

1. Could this lead to a rise in the consumption of own-brand soft drinks and hence the profits of supermarkets like Tesco, Sainsburys, Asda and Morrisons as the leading multinational brands are slowly priced out of the market by a tax hike?

2. Could this lead to a drop in visitors to fast food restaurants like KFC and Burger King (where a meal deal can already hit around £6 per person)? How many fast food joints could get hit by this tax and how would it affect their operations?

3. Could this convince more people to shop at Aldi and Lidl and buy their cheaper goods?

4. How much could everything mentioned above damage overall company profits and hence Britain's GDP and the British government's taxation.

5. Would this actually solve Britain's obesity epidemic? Would the fatties stomach such a tax rise?

6. Just how elastic is the demand for soft drinks?

7. Could profits actually rise in the short term over panic buying before the tax is put into place.

8. Could this tax be bypassed through the use of high fructose corn syrup?",0,1359469228,null,0,1359469469,0,c85m174,t3_17hipf,t1_c85m174,t1_c85j79x,null,1431117853,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Now it is summer 2013, Liverpool are still mid-table, and failed to gain a trophy and to play CL or even Euro League, and the best clubs in the world are chasing our best man, who should be able to start for every club in the world. His main problem is that most of the clubs can't offer 60m+ for him, so I guess an exit clause that is 40m is still a little bit cheap, but affordable for most CL top clubs.

This exit-clause is his plan B, if everything he tried to achieve with Liverpool went horribly wrong. Without an exit clause, he wouldn't have signed a contract til 2018, because interested clubs could never pay the fees.

true,RassimoFlom,null,null,"My 6+stone of weight loss and the combined knowledge of [r/keto] (http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/) disagree with you.

Calorie intake is a massively crude measure of nutrition. It is simply the amount of energy contained in a particular food stuff. You get that figure by burning said food stuff and measuring temperature change in water (this is GCSE level stuff here). It tells you nothing about the nutritional value, how your body breaks it down or what your body uses the components inherent in the foodstuff for.

Your body is a massively efficient tool in terms of ""spending"" calories on exercise. The things your body ""spends"" most calories on are 1)Digesting food and 2) Keeping warm. 

Therefore it follows that if you give the body things that are really easy to digest eg.Glucose, Dextrose, Sucrose and fructose, which you then don't use, you get fat really quickly. It also follows that when you need a burst of energy, or you are in cold conditions, you can eat those sugars or carbs that break down into those sugars in order to get a boost or keep warm.

Ever hear that thing about celery, how eating it actually causes a caloric deficit because of the fibre in it? Well, if you eat fat and protein, without the carbs, you get a similar effect. Which is why diets such as dukan, keto and Atkins work. 

Calorie counting can be used alongside carbohydrate restrictions in order to further promote weight loss, but in practice, regulating portion size is the hardest thing about dieting (in my experience anyway) and isn't really necessary.

However there is some simple maths that illustrates my point.

520.0 cals in 100g chocolate. 520cals worth of celery = 6.9kg. Which is going to take more energy to digest? 

Celery isn't even the best example as most of the nutritional components in it are fibre, which your body can anyway not digest. But take protein. It is calorifically very dense, but also very hard for your body to ""unlock"" those calories...

Limiting carbohydrate is not, as you dismissively put it, a fad. Most Drs now recommend limiting carbs to some degree as a means of losing weight. And any dietician will tell you that the first step to losing weight is to cut out sugar. 

But if you don't believe me, feel free to look at the BMJ's meta-analysis of the effects of dietary sugars on body weight. http://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.e7492

And when you read sugars, then think that, in terms of digestion, foods such as white flour, white rice and mashed potato are 1 small step away from sugar. Fruits and wholegrain flour are 2... etc

TL;DR, Calorie counting is an archaic mechanism for measuring nutrition and, as the repeated failure of millions of obese people shows, calorie controlled diets do not work to lose fat (largely for psychological reasons IMO).

What causes gun violence in the U.S. *today*, that exceeds gun violence in Europe?  
-From the statistics, demographically, it's the inequality of wealth and the legacy of unequal civil rights.  

What causes resistance to gun control in the U.S. today, especially if we try to compare it with European countries?
This is where all the things we tend to talk about are supposed to belong:
-The frontier culture of the U.S. in the past, which today leaves a culture of frontier-ism. 
-The huge rural spaces of the U.S., which encourages self-sufficiency.
-A sense that ""you can never take away all the guns on the street because there are too many"" because the U.S. is just too big, or because people don't want the gov't to have that kind of power. 
-Similarly, the cultural revolutionary spirit of the U.S., which translates to the instinct that big gov't is bad.  

These reasons may have caused more domestic gun violence in the past, like in the 1800s, compared to Europe, I don't know, but today, these things aren't the major problem with gun violence, according to the statistics.  Today, it's the poverty and race angle that is major.  

By the way, the rural/urban divide is something to distinguish.  Urban America has much less culture of frontier-ism and as they vote more Democrat, we can also assume they are less against bigger government.

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/relaxing-childminding-rules-will-worsen-quality-of-care-8449393.html

&gt;Controversial plans by ministers to allow childminders and nursery workers to look after greater numbers of children will lead to a ""deterioration"" in the quality of their care and will not help parents reduce their costs, an official report by the Government's own advisers has warned.

&gt;The report, which has not been published by Michael Gove's Department for Education despite being handed over to officials in November, directly undermines proposals by Elizabeth Truss, the Children's minister, to change adult-to-child ratios because she claims it would help reduce bureaucracy and the financial burden on parents.

[
Peter Elfer (University of Roehampton) and Jools Page (University of Sheffield) report on the outcomes.](http://www.scribd.com/doc/122622476/Nursery-Ratios-and-Babies-under-12m-in-Nursery)

&gt;Purnima Tunaka - Chief Executive National Day Nurseries Association posted:

&gt;We are particularly concerned about suggestions to increase the number of children under three that nursery staff can look after, due to the degree of personal attention needed by very young children. Strong adult:child interactions are vital for good child development. Staff with higher qualifications will still find it difficult to give larger groups of under threes the level of practical care they need. It is particularly important that the government’s investment in free places for disadvantaged two year olds is delivered in high-quality provision.

From the NASUWT:

&gt;Chris Keates - General Secretary NASUWT posted:
The NASUWT has called consistently for more effective action to be taken to enhance the skills of the early years workforce and to improve the often highly unattractive pay and conditions of staff in the sector. However, planning to seek to secure higher qualification and pay levels within the workforce by sacrificing appropriate adult to children ratios is a flawed strategy.

&gt;It is more likely that any increased revenues gained by reducing ratios will simply be diverted to increasing profit margins rather than to enhancing the pay and conditions of staff and the quality of provision for children.

From the representatives of people that this idea is nominally in favour of:

&gt;TUC posted:
By cutting tax credits, freezing child benefit and withdrawing it for higher earners the government has made childcare even more unaffordable. The closure of hundreds of Sure Start centres, despite promising to protect them, has also made it harder to access affordable places.

&gt;But deregulating childcare is not the solution. It will not reduce costs and instead risks reducing the quality of care. We need significant investment in childcare and wide reaching reform. Today’s announcement fails on both grounds and will not be welcomed by parents.

And the (nominal) opposition:

&gt;Shadow Education Secretary posted:
The government isn't listening to parents and isn't listening to what the experts are saying about this. Under this proposal, we could have childminders looking after four one-year-old babies. At that age it is vitally important that children are getting proper care and attention. I don't think it's right to change this. At the moment it's three and the government would make it four. It would undermine quality in our childcare.

So?

&gt;Bin Laden stated America has become a target for attack for troop bases in Saudi Arabia.

It's not nearly so simple as that, there were also some personal issues, issues relating to his disappointment that he wasn't allowed to fight in Iraq, a probable disillusionment with the outcome of the Afghanistan war. You're not too far off there though. Worth reading into if you like these things.

&gt;What is it that you don't understand about extremists and how they legitimise their cause as a direct result from foreign policy?

I understand, extremists use the fact that western forces are in ""muslim lands"" to radicalise young people who then desire to attack the west. I can live with that. I refuse to accept that we should ignore the systematic breaches of human rights that fundamentalist islamists commit in order to avoid the radicalisation of a few illiterate goat herders. It just gives us more nutters to kill and I have absolutely no problem with that whatsoever.

&gt;Before the UK was part of the Afghan war, when before that did we have a 7/7 style attack from Islamists on that scale?

Well, never afaik but then radical islam is a very modern thing, so to ask that question is kind of misguided.

&gt;I never said if wouldn't exist but our foreign policy as well as others is absolutely a big contributing factor.

To an extent, the problem is, as it does exist without us and that small number of people are complete cunts to humanity and need to be exterminated, we go places and exterminate them, and then their mates get a bunch of other illiterate racists to join in, and then we have to kill 100 when we went out to kill 1, but that's fine.

You will be paying back University fees for a _long_ time, it's effectively an extra 10% tax, and that might not sound like a lot but you can use the calculator [here](http://www.listentotaxman.com/) to see just how much it will effect your take home pay (although your repayment threshold is marginally higher).

I would _strongly_ advise doing a more vocational degree such as Engineering or Computer Science or even Mathematics (try maths with economics or finance, and stay applied) as that way you will get a return on investment.

Now for A levels I would definitely take Maths, and I would take Further  Maths if possible. I would also take Physics. Personally I would take Biology as the fourth one because I preferred it to Chemistry and it has some essays etc. that give you a broader skill set. Although if you are really good at German then a language always helps!

FWIW, I did Bio, Chem, FMaths, Maths and Physics as my state comp didn't care too much what people chose and let me take 5, and as I was successful in them they let me continue with all of them to A2 level where I obtained 5As (what was then the maximum grade). Chemistry was scraping it though :P

I almost certainly wouldn't choose to do Philosophy at uni as you will struggle to find employment. 

Also judging by your name you are interested in German. I got to study in Germany as part of the DAAD RISE program for 2 summers. It was awesome. [See here](http://www.daad.de/rise/en/) and remember to apply if you do physics or a STEM subject.

&gt; 520.0 cals in 100g chocolate. 520cals worth of celery = 6.9kg. Which is going to take more energy to digest? 

Sugar has caused obesity simply because of the calorie density. People don't know how much they are eating. When you actually do the measures you find that the extra 2/3 chocolate bars a week you eat accounts for 10 pounds of weight gain over a year.

That is the reason sugar controlled diets work. Any amount of additional twix in your diet means a large increase in calories. Whereas any amount cut out means a large decrease.

It is very easy to control calories by controlling sugar this way. However there is nothing special about sugar in the long run. The reason it works is because it is very easy to go calorie positive with sugar. It is also very easy to have a nutritional diary that bares no resemblance to reality if you are sneaking the odd snack.

Most people who struggle are not listing everything. When you really do make an effort and list everything these people counting often have a thousand calories extra that they thought nothing of. Yes diets that emphasize sugars will do better simply because they dodge the tendency to cheat on your counting. The BMJ study just deals with effectiveness. It doesn't deal with mechanisms.

No, that is not what I want, those are, for the most part, a good use of public money.

Yeah, the negative effects are the externalities. 

For instance, the externalities of heart disease due to smoking is covered (and more) by the duty/tax on cigarettes.

true,mabye,null,null,"I have mixed feelings about this. In general, I have no problem with the concept of a constitutional monarchy, since it mostly seems like a clever tourism trick to look historical whilst actually not caring. It's not like the monarchy have any real legal power - even where they technically do, attempting to exercise it would result in its rapid removal. I've never been convinced by the arguments based on cost, partly since the propaganda on both sides is extremely biased, but it isn't clear to me that it's important - the olympics, for instance, cost the same as many years of supporting the monarchy even by republican estimates.

With strict limits on the actual power of the monarchy (i.e. basically none), I also disagree with most of the points raised in the OP. From the point of view of the queen being a tourism moneymaker (give or take whatever the deal is about the government controlling her land), I rather think she's serving us rather than the other way around...certainly, would you really want to take her job? It seems pretty rubbish to me. Maybe you get to own some nice clothes, but your entire life is planned out. There's no point in being technically rich if you never get a holiday from your job.

I do have a problem with some aspects of the monarchy. One point that I rarely see brought up is that it seems horrendously unfair to take a young child and blueprint their entire life due to hereditary celebrity status. I expect they technically can abdicate or skip succession or whatever, but that doesn't change that they get thrown into years of public spotlight that they never asked for.

However, there is also a biochemical factor which is touched upon in the meta-analysis, but which (because it is a meta analysis) is not investigated further. Here is the quote: 

""Sugars (particularly table sugar, sucrose, and high fructose corn syrup) contribute to the intake of fructose, which in turn can, at least in some people, increase levels of uric acid and hyperinsulinaemia.105 Hyperuricaemia has been identified as a potentially important and independent predictor of obesity and the metabolic syndrome.2""

Edit: Wording and formatting.

&gt;Football clubs wishing to take part in the UEFA Champions League or UEFA Europa League must balance their football-related expenditure over a three-year period up to the 2014–15 season.

&gt;The 2011–12 season is the first season which counts towards the 2014–15 assessment. Clubs, however, will be allowed to make a loss of €45 million (£39.4 million) over the three years, falling to €30 million from 2015–16 IF the loss was covered by equity contribution only. The first season that UEFA will begin actively monitoring the financial situation of individual clubs is 2013–14, but this will take into account losses made in the two preceding years (2011–12 and 2012–13).

&gt;From 2013-14 UEFA will be able to ban clubs from playing in European competitions the following season if the rules have not been met but it is not until 2018 that clubs will be expected to bring their annual losses below £8.8 million (based on 2010 exchange rates)

&gt;Only a club’s outgoings in transfers and employee benefits (including wages) will be counted over income from gate receipts, TV revenue, advertising, merchandising, sales of players and prize money is included in the assessment. Any money spent on infrastructure, training facilities or youth development will not be included. The legislation currently allows for eight separate punishments to be taken against clubs transgressing the rules, based in order of severity; Reprimand / Warning, fines, points deduction, withholding of Revenue from a UEFA competition, Prohibition to register new players for UEFA competitions, Restrictions on how many players a club can register for UEFA competitions, Disqualification from a competition in progress and Exclusion from future competitions.",0,1359476135,null,0,false,0,c85nvkq,t3_17hx21,t1_c85nvkq,t3_17hx21,null,1431118715,20,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,20

There are many in the US who can see the need for an AR-15 or carrying a handgun and that is up for them to decide.  Most people don't like having to be dependent on the Government for their safety and security.  Especially when that Government admits that it cannot adequately provide for that.  It is not responsible to respond to 911 calls, it is not responsible for your personal safety, and it is incapable of being everywhere at once.  In times of strife and disaster, folks may need rifles and other weapons to defend themselves against those who wish to do them harm.

Furthermore, the rural/urban divide is a myth.  Obviously, NYC will never have much of a shooting culture because the laws there prevent it.  But jump across the Hudson River to New Jersey, and you have a million or so gun owners who love to shoot.  In fact, many New Yorkers cross the river to go shooting because they are restricted from enjoying their civil right and hobby.

&gt;  I don't think urban America ""shakes its head"" at the surveillance and gun control of Europe as much.

I disagree.  Even in liberal urban centers, folks are wary of increased police presence.  They don't like having to have their bags searched before entering the subway, or having cameras monitor their movements.  While libertarian, conservative, and liberal Americans may not see eye to eye on gun rights, they tend to share a mutual distrust of Governmental overreach.  It's just sad when liberals and conservatives battle it out over certain items, when philosophically, they should be on the same side.

For the people who aren't actually the monarch, there's some truth in this, but their riches are hereditary. Not being royalty wouldn't affect this aspect of their lifestyle.

Part of my attitude here is due to my understanding of the way their finances work. As in my original post, this understanding may be wrong due to the nature of the propaganda on both sides. As far as I know, the state takes revenue of some sort from royally owned land in return for paying for the monarchy...is this correct? I can hardly begrudge them having a good time using money that technically really is theirs, since they really do have masses of hereditary land. The problems of hereditary wealth are different ones that I might have different opinions on, but I don't think their ability to have a lavish lifestyle is important to their being the monarchy.

I suppose what I'm really trying to say is, I think being in the royal family makes their lives worse, not better. They're already rich, but having the monarch label pushes them into the public eye and, for a few of them, gets them lumbered with the annoying position of actually being the monarch.

&gt; If people want to be royalists that is fine. Lets not pretend they have anything other than an incredibly easy life though.
 
My comments were mostly referring to the actual monarch. I don't disagree that the rest of them are rich and can live lavishly, but as above I'm not sure this is relevant to them being the royal line or not.",0,1359477128,null,0,false,0,c85o7bj,t3_17hy4v,t1_c85o7bj,t1_c85ny4m,null,1431118872,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,G_Morgan,cnty-wales,Wales,"The view of the crown estate is massively distorted by royalist propaganda. The truth is more when it was set up the crown estate haemorrhaged money. The monarch was facing poverty so agreed to a deal where the state paid for the maintenance and upkeep of the properties. In exchange the monarchy would get a consistent fund.

For the vast majority of its existence it was essentially a way for the monarchy to put its expenses on the tax payers books and actually get paid for the privilege.

The state developed the estate and through tax payer funding and government direction created the crown estate that exists today. It is an economic power house because of the long term funding and stewardship of the state. If it was a free hold the state would be able to claim ownership given that they are the ones who've actually paid for it. Under UK property laws long term maintenance like this essentially grants you ownership.

As it is the crown estates is not a free hold. Its status is far trickier than simply being ""property of the royal family"". If parliament kicked out the Windsors and made me monarch the crown estate would not become their private property. I could take it as my private property (any new monarch has this right). I could maintain the current situation. I could give it over to the UK government as a free hold.

If we dissolved the monarchy the status is up in the air. The fact it isn't a free hold actually helps us. We could dissolve the estate and make it property of the British government without touching the property rights legislation the economy depends upon. So it wouldn't upset confidence in UK property rights. Mainly because the estate is not a property in the normal sense.

Really it depends upon the semantic debate about who owns the crown. Given that the crown passes with the monarch, not along normal hereditary lines, it is readily apparent it doesn't simply belong to the Windsors.

The consultations part of the timescale is the only legitimately 100% political part of the delay - the bulk of the timescale will be taken up with the twin demons of ""Finance"" and ""Land Ownership"", with the latter requiring inordinate timescales to resolve. 

We're not China, we don't have a government that either owns the land or doesn't give a damn about who owns the land: We have legal processes to go through to make stuff like this happen, and we have a permanently full court system with long delays for processes like appeals etc. 

Personally I'm in favour of it: There's no way to rejuvenate the existing rail routes without even more massive disruption to people's lives AND the transportation system. Britain's current railways were built in a time when towns and cities were a fraction of their current size (meaning there's less uncontested land now to route through), and for trains that ran at a fraction of their current speeds (meaning they didn't need nice straight lines or really, really wide curves to be taken at speed). We can't solve either of those issues without breaking new ground (and annoying whoever currently owns it), so we might as well make a completely fresh start and leave the current rail system in place whilst we do it.

The French had the right idea in 70's/80's when they built their TGV intercity network, and 30 years later we're going to have to admit that and copy them.

I am the first to slate Redknapp, but he is one of the best at what he does, getting players fired up, and winning whatever he can with the best 11 he has available.

What he lacks is primarily tactical nous, he also has an attitude with the media I think the board got fed up with, I certainly did. For example, where AVB would say JD was nothing to worry about because he understands it will allow us to not get mugged off, Redknapp would have happily admitted an injury to JD and added another £5m on whoever we wanted to buy.

Redknapp was nothing more than a man motivator, and like I say, he was one of the best. Now he's gone, for me, the sourness has gone with him, and as a manager and person, I like him again now.

AVB has tactical idea's falling out of his penis! He knows how the transfer market works, he knows how important scouting and tailoring your team to the opposition is. And to my surprise, and I could yet be proved wrong, he seems much more loyal.

To your questions...

Accomodation can be expensive, you are probably best off going in student halls for the first year, as this gives you a great opportunity to meet people/make friends, make arrangements for people you want to live with in subsequent years, and it's less of a big deal if you don;t like one of your neighbours as you're not stuck in the same house with them. 

A student job, unfortunately, would definitely not cover everything, in fact it probably only just cover your rent :(, and thats not including bills and everything on top of that. I'm not sure about the  student halls, but for private accomodation you're looking at around £300/month plus £50-£100/month on bills. Working 20 hours a week (the maximum I would recommend you do, as otherwise you won't have time for uni and chilling) at a minimum wage job would probably get you around £300-£400/month. And that's all providing you can actually get a job, something which is not easy in the current job market.

However, it's not all doom and gloom, there are scholarships and funding oppotunities available to international students like [this](http://www.bournemouth.ac.uk/futurestudents/postgraduate/funding/bu_international_scholarship.html) one, plus whatever sort of funding your home government can offer. All in all, it won't be cheap, but I think it'll be worth it :D.

The company I work for provides for-life products so either we pay you for life (e.g. a pension) or you re-pay a loan we give you for life. Taking the pension side of it we do better rates for you if your sick. Basically if you've got cancer we'll give you a better rate because we reckon you'll die sooner. You win as you get more money, we win because we get your buisness rather than lose it to a bigger comapany able to offer you a better standard rate. It's kind of morbid but also interesting at the same time.

We look at a huge range of factors (some of the medical question forms are 17 pages long) and one of the really obvious ones is gender. However we can't do that anymore. We give the same rates to women as we do to men. Now men will get less because their gender and therefore shorter average life span can't be taken into account when assessing their case. We're allowed to put hundreds of data points into our calculation engine to get the best solution expect gender because that'd be sexist.

I'm all for gender neutrality when something is an assumption but when it's a fact it shouldn't be an issue.

Also this will have impacted the likes of Shiela's wheels because you can't sell any product on a gender basis any more. Factually women are safer drivers but that doesn't matter any more.

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"Where did I blame them?  It's been done to them.  I was overly broad, I accept, there are certainly good ones out there, as there will always be any time you get a large sample of humanity.

Work isn't just something you find lying around, there's not an amount of work just out there and it will appear.  This is the very nub of the problem.  There is so much life being sucked out (and has been sucked out for years) of the country by depriving it of capital and credit that jobs were not being created.  That's been going on for a long time, but it was hidden by government spending money to ""create"" jobs.  Now they find that each time you do that not only do you have to take the money to pay for it from the private sector, but you have also deprived the private sector of one productive worker.

I do not blame the young people, they were indeed doing what they were told.  I blame those that told them that all they needed was a degree and life would be rosy.  How do you imagine that jobs are ""created"" then?  They are created, for example, by someone who has skills that aren't recognised by the existing market.  They start off on their own then, seeing no other option.  Some fail, and some succeed.  Those that succed can find that they have more work than they can complete themselves and create jobs.

Why isn't that happening then?  The answer is (1) our young have been made dependent by too much nannying, they say things like ""oh wait there aren't any jobs"", and that's the end of that; and (2) it's incredibly tough to start a small business, primarily because of the vast quantity of regulation you have to comply with any time you interact with the public.

Summary - MMR Vaccinations rarer in immigrants, but 74% of unvaccinated children are through conscious choice.  

&gt;Abstract

&gt;**Objectives** To estimate uptake of the combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) and single antigen vaccines and explore factors associated with uptake and reasons for not using MMR.

&gt;**Design** Nationally representative cohort study.

&gt;**Setting** Children born in the UK, 2000-2.

&gt;**Participants** 14 578 children for whom data on immunisation were available.

&gt;**Main outcome measures** Immunisation status at 3 years defined as “immunised with MMR,” “immunised with at least one single antigen vaccine,” and “unimmunised.”

&gt;**Results** 88.6% (13 013) were immunised with MMR and 5.2% (634) had received at least one single antigen vaccine. Children were more likely to be unimmunised if they lived in a household with other children (risk ratio 1.74, 95% confidence interval 1.35 to 2.25, for those living with three or more) or a lone parent (1.31, 1.07 to 1.60) or if their mother was under 20 (1.41, 1.08 to 1.85) or over 34 at cohort child’s birth (reaching 2.34, 1.20 to 3.23, for ≥40), more highly educated (1.41, 1.05 to 1.89, for a degree), not employed (1.43, 1.12 to 1.82), or self employed (1.71, 1.18 to 2.47). Use of single vaccines increased with household income (reaching 2.98, 2.05 to 4.32, for incomes of ≥£52 000 (€69 750, $102 190)), maternal age (reaching 3.04, 2.05 to 4.50, for ≥40), and education (reaching 3.15, 1.78 to 5.58, for a degree). Children were less likely to have received single vaccines if they lived with other children (reaching 0.14, 0.07 to 0.29, for three or more), had mothers who were Indian (0.50, 0.25 to 0.99), Pakistani or Bangladeshi (0.13, 0.04 to 0.39), or black (0.31, 0.14 to 0.64), or aged under 25 (reaching 0.14, 0.05 to 0.36, for 14-19). Nearly three quarters (74.4%, 1110) of parents who did not immunise with MMR made a “conscious decision” not to immunise.

&gt;**Conclusions** Although MMR uptake in this cohort is high, a substantial proportion of children remain susceptible to avoidable infection, largely because parents consciously decide not to immunise. Social differentials in uptake could be used to inform targeted interventions to promote uptake.",0,1359481023,null,0,1359481239,0,c85pisq,t3_17i0dq,t1_c85pisq,t1_c85pb71,null,1431119500,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

because in the evidence you quoted, the difference in weight gain/loss is attributed to eating more - a factor that is influenced by the types of food, but not, as you imply, by differences in the way food is used.

Y'know, instead of developing players and putting out a team that represents your club, like...maybe...an actual sport, they think it's fine to go around stealing everyone else's, because ""fuck you, we're billionaires."" Three biggest teams in the UK are Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United. Every one of them has at last 1 player that has been brought through their respective academies. Chelsea and City? 0. If FFP is enforced Chelsea and City will slowly deteriorate, and why would they want that? I hate City and Chelsea more than United because of what those two clubs stand for. They ruined the Premier League. At least United have earned their money. ""You can't win anything with kids."" We'll they did, and their ""brand"" took off from there.

true,syntax,cnty-scotland,Stravaigin,"Right, I understand the idea.  My (I confess, rather sarcastic) reponse was intended to indicate that this is very hard to do.

In the case of alcohol, the limits are quite clear - 0.5% or more, and it's 'alcoholic'.  It takes more than that to be noticable - a beer at 2.8% can be confused for a 'non-alcholic' beverage by someone who regularly drinks (although the difference is clearer to a non-drinker).  

That is - there is a clear gap between where the standard is set, and where the effects kick in.  There is also a clear point above which alcohol must be deliberately produced (or added) to be in a product, and that is also clearly below the limit [0]

Now, lets turn our attention to sugar. Where do you put the limit on sugar?

Given that 'a piece of fruit' is a canonical [1] 'Healthy food', you either exclude the fruit content, or rule it out.  Grapes have 92% or so of their calories from sugar.  Writing rules to cover that will be painful.  You'll end up including freshly squeezed fruit juice, _or_ giving licence to allow product that pervert the intent of the rules.

Not only that, but once I tune something to have as much sugar as the limit is (either by simple sugar, or exploiting any loopholes for 'Fruit'), then I can boost the sweetness with sucralose, or saccharin, or aspartame, or a cocktail of them all.

Most of the time when artificial sweeteners are used, it's to produce 'low calorie' foods, and the aftertaste that puts many people off them is a signature of their use.  However, reduce the quantity to balance the sugar, and you get the higher gravity that sugar gives, with all the sweetness, and much reduced artificial sweetener problems.

And it'll not be classified as 'Junk', hence not taxed as much, hence cheaper.

This arises because there is no convenient natural gap in which to define a limit.

Fats are a little more tricky, however, there's an existing 'low fat' market that's already got many tricks up its sleeve that can be exploited.

As an aside, I think you're at risk of being misunderstood on the problems of HFCS - whilst, yes, they can cause cirrhosis of the liver and NAFLD, that occurs at significantly higher intakes of sugars than it take of alcohol to cause the same level of damage - and there are a number of other deleterious effects of alcohol that have been shown not to be risks from HFCS (mouth cancer, for example).   There's also a case to be made that it's obesity _plus_ HFCS that cases the problems - even thought HFCS can lead to obesity, it not clear [2] that it's correlated with increased risk outside of obesity.

[0] It's around 0.1 to 0.2%, higher in fruit that anything else; if I recall correctly.

[1] Although perhaps it should not always be - that's a argument that could be made.

[2] Last time I read through on that - but that may have been clarified in the past couple of years; a quick search suggests no, but that wasn't exhaustive.",0,1359487199,null,0,false,0,c85rpdj,t3_17hipf,t1_c85rpdj,t1_c85qg0w,null,1431120536,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

This is fair enough.  I should be more tolerant.  But I just fear there isn't time.

Well, we can debate that, but frankly it's pejorative to me because of what it represents, not because of any magick or propaganda.  Neo-liberal, as I understand it, is basically a reinvention of classical liberalism with certain State invention for the ruling class intact, foreign policy - aka warfare on behalf of corporate interests - being the clearest example.

&gt;You should note that I've advocated for the overthrow of every regime which isn't democratic, or commits human rights violations en masse, whether that comforts you from consistency or horrifies you from extremity I have no idea.

Mostly, I suspect that ""democratic"", ""human rights violations"", etc. are self-serving justifications for business decisions (not on your part necessarily, but for the press propaganda which leads you top believe this or that war is just).

true,dwair,eng-Cornwall,Kernow,"Yup I might well be an irrational loon but as far as arguments go I'll stand by it, and I will fully admit to being grossly non specific and perhaps flippant in my post.  To me, based on my knowledge of the area and the amount of geological interest it seems to have generated in the last 5 years or so my speculation is valid.  Its certainly a more logical reason for military involvement than starting the second Gulf war on the basis of say looking for non existent WMD’s.   Basically I think Mali has the potential for being a bit more than a dust bowl with a bit of gold scattered in it. 

TBH In my post I did overlook the West’s and especially Britain’s general political reasons for gaining favour with various West African nations and wanting to rid the area of AQM insurgents or even being cynical, perhaps needing a new long term proving ground for military exports now we are shipping out of Afghanistan.   There are many and varied reasons from ranging from purely humanitarian to indirectly financial and political for getting involved in this conflict. I just picked on one.

On a personal level I don’t really care what the motives are.  I think restoring the Northern parts of Mali held by the militants is a good idea.  It’s a part of the world I have got to know very well over the last 20 years and it saddens me greatly to see what’s happened there in the last 18 months.

They are clearly accurate unless you blank out the direct quotes I made from the articles themselves... 

The editorial in the links I provided attribute the rally in question to the violence of emanating from the flag protests. All apart from one of these do not mention the comments made against republican activity. That much is self-evident.

&gt;You stated in a roundabout way

I'll repeat again my original point:

*Thanks for repeating my raison d'etre - and if you manage to get beyond the mock outrage perhaps you'll begin to see my point:*

*What I am pointing out is the complete silence of this vociferous no-longer-taking-any-shit middle ground when it comes to tangible threats to peace here that don't involve shaking their fists metaphorically at those scummy loyalist chavs, etc.*

*And I'm accusing the self declared middle ground of being largely made up of two groups:*

- *NIMBYs who think the height of the Troubles were about being stuck a traffic jam for an hour, and couldn't be less animated when actual violence presents itself a few miles down the motorway/doesn't involve them being inconvenienced.*

- *Outraged and intolerant nationalism which is happy to hijack the above's disdain for the much-publicised loyalist protests and throw barely disguised cheap sectarian jibs into the mix in the name of 'peace'.*

&gt;Irrelevant to the original point you were making about those organizing the peace rally though which was completely and utterly wrong on so many levels.

I'm not sure if you've noticed but given the above I think it's equally clear that I'm referring to the sentiment of those online that lead me to start posting on this subject in the first place, hence my response to the mod's reposting of said reasoning. Those shouting the loudest can be divided into the above two groups and there is precious little evidence of any other opinion, and as the twitterstream over last weekend highlighted, nothing like the bluster reserved for the flag protests appeared despite widespread reporting of the incident.

One or two companies digging holes in the ground? Dwair that's happening just about everywhere. There's oil just about *everywhere*, it's just we only care if there's fucking *tonnes* of it, and even then only if it's easy to get at.

&gt;Its certainly a more logical reason for military involvement than starting the second Gulf war on the basis of say looking for non existent WMD’s.

Second gulf war and all bets are off, I do not pretend to know their true motivations for that (and I scorn those that do) - I agreed with knocking Saddam off his pedestal 'cos he was a right cunt, but the whole thing was a real cluster.

&gt;Basically I think Mali has the potential for being a bit more than a dust bowl with a bit of gold scattered in it.

You're suggesting 1/4 of Africa and 2 global powers are going to war over the idea that there ""might"" be something in some desert wasteland which we have no serious evidence of there being anything in except the gold we were already taking out.

You're also of course ignoring the fact that the Malians asked for help *last year*, not French help, any help.

&gt;On a personal level I don’t really care what the motives are. I think restoring the Northern parts of Mali held by the militants is a good idea. It’s a part of the world I have got to know very well over the last 20 years and it saddens me greatly to see what’s happened there in the last 18 months.

Well that's something.

true,strolls,null,null,"Good question!

I don't have the answer for you, but I might be able to point you in the right direction. 

There was an article posted to another subreddit a while back which compared how Google and Bing Maps differ in showing features at different resolutions.

Part of this was about how, back in the old days, cartographers used to place these features (settlements being just one such) by hand, based on complex sets of rules and professional instinct.

/u/NotMud is more or less right on this (the only reason I'm not replying to him is because the thread is a day old and I don't want OP to miss this response) in that one of those reasons is visual clutter and readability.

Take two villages of the same size and one might not be shown because it's merely a commuter village or because there are lots of other markings to fit on map in this area. Another village of the same size would be shown were it in the middle of a large arable plain.

You might say ""but maps are science! they show facts! it's not scientific and factual if the mapmaker just puts what he likes on there"". This may be true, but one has to consider the purpose of the map, and this is an important part of the cartographer's job. At the end of the day, you cannot physically fit *every* feature on a map, which is why we have maps at different scales.

If we elect to start our map by showing every feature of a certain type (such as towns of a certain size) then we'll have empty space between those features - if we then decide to make our map more useful, by adding others features (such as churches and pubs) then it's inevitable that some of them will clash with each other and the map maker will be obliged to print one on top of the other, or move them a smidgeon, or just miss one off if it's not particularly noteworthy or doesn't help the traveller navigate. 

Another aspect of the cartographer's skill was in placing labels - the names of towns - in such a way to maximise usefulness of the available space. You'll notice that on the map you posted Manchester is labelled above the dot and Liverpool below, to leave space for Sheffield to the right; likewise Stoke-on-Trent, Leicester and Coventry are labelled on different sides of the dot.

So all of this will be done algorithmically on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) like Google Maps. Click on the zoom button and see how Ewell disappears as other features appear. Zoom some more and it reappears again. This *is* intentional, and I would think this particular example of Ewell is just a corner-case - a bug that appears because the mappers want to show what features they can, recognising that they can't show everything. If you zoom in we see Ewell replaced by Wimbledon and Croydon, then zoom again and Wimbledon is replaced by Fulham, Slough and Bracknell.

Men have digestive systems similar to chimpanzees who primarily eat vegetables and meat whenever they can get it.

Meat was also very much a modern fad. Driven by post WW2 society when we wanted to create a home fit for heroes. Before this time meat was only eaten by most families on Sunday. Hence the concept of a Sunday roast. Britain has a whole fucking tradition based around the rarity of meat.

Meat only became a staple part of the diet with the evolution of modern agriculture. The green revolution was a necessity to even grow enough feed crops to make meat cheap and widely available.

The r/keto downvote brigade can do whatever they want. They are very wrong about this. When oil runs out we won't even be able to physically afford their diet any more.

- ""Big Pit"" in Blaenavon and experience the history of coal mining in Wales. GREAT!

And meeting the Doctor opened her mind to what was out there and what she could be.

In Runaway Bride, we meet a brash, self-absorbed, small-minded, loud woman who most people would instantly dislike. But we see glimpses of a strong 'moral code' that she lives by. When she comes back for her season, she's slightly different. She's motivated and desperate to spend more time with the Doctor and see what is out there. She's a match for the Doctor and becomes a friend and a bit of a moral compass for him. 

As the season goes on, she is still continuously down on herself though and doesn't believe she's anything more than 'a temp from Chiswick'......until her final episode. 

For me, that's what is so tragic. Just when she starts to believe she is capable of more, it has to be taken away from her. We see a little of all that Donna could have been, but it is taken away and she goes right back to the brash, self-absorbed, small-minded person we met at the start of Runaway Bride.

I know it happened to me (I *hate* River Song) but there's sometimes no explanation beyond 'she just doesn't sit well with me personally'. And that's fine.

What I adored about Donna was a mixture of elements, I suppose. For one thing she seemed like a laugh to be around. She didn't behave like an inferior, wide-eyed girl next to the Doctor (which is something even River is known to suffer from occasionally), she had layers (ogres have layers!) where you could just *see* her trying so hard to come off as strong and brash but then again almost every episode she exibits truly touching sympathy for everything and everyone (Pompeii and the Ood's song come to mind). She evolves and grows up throughout the arc, she has a wicked sharp tongue and is not afraid to use it, she thinks quick on her feet, she seemed to understand the Doctor in ways many other companions couldn't (their little exchange at the end of Midnight comes to mind). 

To put it simply, I loved that she was MORE under the surface than her character's actions led you to believe at first. She tries to come off as all loud and crass but she cries more than any other companion - this is my impression at least - and not even over her own misfortune but usually about someone else's.

It is kinda funny, the title of all things is what drew me in. While I was looking at all the channels the title ""Doctor Who"" just had a weird symmetry that compelled me to click on it. The episode was ""Cold Blood."" My first impression was this must be some cheesy horror film. Bad reptile costumes (Silurians) and a hot chick screaming out of her mind (Amy). Anyways I continued watching and got through the episode. Its was a decent first episode. I became really intrigued when I realized it was a time-travel show because they kept showing previews for next weeks episode (Vincent and the Doctor) during the commercial breaks.

Like I said I was bored out of my mind so I decided to go back and start the season off right. I bought the first 8 episodes of the series and caught myself up. I was hooked. Anytime a Doctor Who rerun was on BBC America I would watch it. BBC America also started running Torchwood reruns and I fell in love with that too.

Too many civvies would die that way, have to go in and just kill them slowly. That's cool though.

&gt;he more people we kill (even accidental) the more people they recruit.

Well, not to sound callous, but the world can make bullets faster than it can make people.

&gt;You can't kill thousands of militants that like to hide without killing thousands of civilians too.

I know you can't, that's unfortunate. Definitely has to be managed.

&gt;If you want to fuel a positive feedback loop like that then at least be aware of how it would inevitably end.

I am aware of how it *could* end. I accept that. Civilisation is more important that lives.

&gt;There's a reason why we try to focus on nation building, stabilising a country to allow it to defend itself in the future. Carpet bombing countries would make this problem even worse.

I agree with nation building, that's precisely what we'll be doing in Mali for the next 5-10 years.

&gt;You should seek some help because you seem to have a very positive view of mass killings. That isn't healthy.

Not at all. I just reject the idea that we should let civilians be abused and murdered and subjected to the whims of religious fascists just because we're afraid of getting involved. If by killing a cancerous cell you accidentally produce 10 more you don't say that you shouldn't have killed the cancer, you simply kill the other 10.

&gt;The war on terror cannot be solved by killing.

""You can't fight ideas with bullets"" - except, you don't need to, you just need to fight the people who hold those ideas. The problem is not the ideas anyway, only an illiterate idiot would believe in these things, the problem is a viral meme in human society, and I can't see any way to excise the malignant parts of it other than by death.

true,energyi,null,null,"I read an article a few months ago where one of his assistant managers (Bond or Jordan, can't remember which one, I'll try and find it) admitted that the England speculation surrounding Redknapp damaged our season a lot. 

I don't understand it, if he can go on trial for tax evasion, have heart surgery and still maintain the form of the team (Spurs 5 - Newcastle 0 anyone?) how can he not handle the pressure and excitement of a possible future role? Being English myself I get how the England managers job is the holy grail of employment for many of us, but finishing 3rd with Spurs and then leading England into the Euro would have been a great way for him to end the season. I doubt there would be many hard feelings about it among the Spurs players, fans and Levy. Who could be angry at a man for wanting to manage his country? Also surely it would be in his best interests for Spurs to do as well as possible to further impress the FA and get the England job when the season finished? I was disappointed that he left Spurs and disappointed again that we didn't get the best English manager for our national team.

I think it's a likely that the lack of depth (or Harry refusing to change his favourite 11 unless he had to) caused a lot of mental fatigue and so did more damage to our season than any other factor. Teams that win leagues have good depth. Our best 11 last season could beaten any other in the league on it's day but injuries and fatigue hampered us because Harry was unwilling to give players like Pienaar and Kranjčar any game time. So instead we do things like lose to QPR when they only had 1 shot on target all game.

With regards to the substitution I assume you are talking about the Aston Villa game when Harry decided to bring on Parker rather than Defoe? I think most of us were crying out for a goal, and therefore probably a win, to boost our chances of 3rd place at the end of the season. I don't blame Harry too much for this, making 4th a near certainty rather than risking a loss and letting Newcastle leapfrog us could be seen as a smart move. Nobody expected Chelsea to win the bloody champions league and take our place (bastards). Not when they had Bayern Munich in their own stadium at the final.

Maybe it's because I'm English but I can't stay mad at old bollock-chops for long. His time at Spurs didn't end on a high but remember he had us playing some of the best football we have in a long time. He gave us amazing times like when we beat both AC Milan and Inter Milan in the Champions League. 

I really like AVB and I think he's going to do great things with Spurs, so I'm not saying we would be better off if Harry had never left. Just don't be too hard on the man! Sorry for the very long post I just feel pretty strongly about this, I'll always look back on Harry's time at Spurs and remember the good times.

I don't remember where I read it, but some pundit was talking about how lower league teams cause such massive upsets in cups because they play with an unexpected level of bite and graft. Premier teams just aren't expecting it. It's a different kind of match all together. BR summed it up: some of these fringe and young players need to play every game like it's a cup final. They can more than afford to, because they most likely aren't going to be selected for the next fixture.

Last September I was in England for a couple of weeks.   The newspaper was all about ""Next time on..."", ""The Doctor is a cowboy...""  ""Matt Smith...""

We should do a charity drive to offer the paedophiles that work at the Daily Mail help.  Get it out of their system if possible or at least help them manage their desires.

Playing Bertrand there won't help with the problems we've been facing. Contrary to what the majority of fans say, we're not losing because of Torres.

We're losing because of an inability to control the game and create space/opportunities in front of goal. With Luiz gone, we miss a physical presence in the middle and one who can pass the ball. While Oscar doesn't provide the physical presence, he can help us control the ball and therefore the game from that position.

It additionally helps to remove Oscar from cramping the middle as he loves to do. I'm a big fan of what Torres and Ba can do together, I think they really complement each other (both of them don't seem to be the selfish types of players, they're more concerned about who has the better opportunity to score).",0,1359498689,null,0,false,0,c85vval,t3_17i9l7,t1_c85vval,t1_c85rfdn,null,1435636589,8,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,8

For gods sake he was brought in for his supposed tactical know how and defensive genius. Where is all of that; we're still handing out goals to everyone and their mothers. And speaking of his tactics he keeps running the 4231 that RDM was criticized for running (In the game against brentford he put out a squad that was better suited for a 433 with Bertrand( Left back) and marin playing as wingers. These are two players who like to hug the the side lines and deliver cross. But instead we played in a 4231 again and they both looked like shit)
RDM was fired for far less and he didn't even have the luxury of a capable striker like demba ba, and had a few key players injured including the back up striker. During the swansea game Rafa put out an injured player in luiz who didn't even make the bench three days prior and now our central midfield is thinner than ever. We're now out of two easy competitions that we should've won, and we keep struggling against weaker opposition. It seams that Rafa is heading in the same direction he did at inter and it just pisses me off.
I live in america and i watch american sports and i really don't know what the big deal is. American fans boo, chant, and call for their own coaches to be fired and players to be benched.

Fans are human like all of us, and they act like humans; they like good thing and hate bad things. Why are they supposed clap for someone who they don't like when he isn't even doing anything to earn their support and respect.

true,Bloop2012,null,null,"Going to take this point by point...

1) There is no way to separate citizens of rural US from those from more urban areas legally. The highest law of our land is the Constitution of the United States supplemented by the Bill of Rights. Any law that fails to apply equally to all citizens is doomed to be ruled unconstitutional. Equal protection under law is a cornerstone of the US legal system.

Yes I know that there were other legal philosophies that segmented the population (men and women, black and white), but given time these laws were also deemed unconstitutional. Creating laws that affect only people according to where they live is the first step to having different laws for different classes, so I am really opposed to that idea.

2) The government will be able to put a hurt on the illegal gun trade as soon as they decide to fence of the US borders, and inspect 100 percent of shipping and containers that enter the US by air, sea, or land. Until that can happen we will continue to see an influx of guns, drugs, and other illegal materials.

Yes, police should be able to outgun the criminals but that's already not the case. And preventing a citizen from legally owning a firearm or firearm type does not mean your cutting criminals off from buying or making their own. An example would be the 1997 Bank of America robbery in North Hollywood California. California has some of the most restrictive gun ownership laws in the country, and yet two criminals were able to get materials to make illegal body armor. They were armed with the Chinese version of the AK-47's loaded with armor piercing rounds, so that same body armor was rendered useless for the police officers wearing it. They were loaded with other weapons as well and over 3000 rounds of ammunition. The ensuing shootout was a joke. The police were at that time using .38 caliber and 9mm hand guns for their sidearms. Riot shotguns were in cruisers when heavier firepower was needed. The moving gun battle was over 20 minutes long and almost 2000 rounds were exchanged. The criminals were able to score hits through cruiser doors, while the police side arms had a difficult time penetrating the home made armor of the criminals. This incident lead to another round of weapon and magazine restrictions, as well as enhanced weaponry for LAPD officers. [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Hollywood_shootout)

In the end, I agree in theory that there is no need for assault weapons but until the illegal gun trade can be significantly reduced I'm uncomfortable giving up my right to a weapon legally when I don't know what may be used against me illegally. As for non-lethal options, they have their place... but if a man comes at me or my loved ones with lethal intent, I'm not going to shoot to wound or try to drive him off. I'm feel I'm justified to end the threat right then and there with any means at my disposal.

But dude, Physics &amp; further maths are such a huge step up from GCSE. I got straight A*s at GCSE (including a GCSE I took without lessons) and I did very little revision. 

I now take Maths, Physics, Economics &amp; history. I started doing further maths (albeit in 40% of the normal time for a subject) and I could not cope with the workload. I just didn't put in enough effort. Be prepared for that.

Physics is also a killer. Honestly, I regret taking it. It requires *a lot* of extra work, and it's a massive step up from GCSE. I don't particularly need it for what I want to do and I seriously wish I had taken French or Classics over Physics. Be sure you want to take it, do not choose it lightly.

Make sure your workload is manageable though. Expect it to be more than GCSE, but you shouldn't be up until 11 or 12 every night doing work. A few hours a night is reasonable, 6 hours is not. 

But more than anything, pick stuff you're going to enjoy doing. I love my economics &amp; history courses. I enjoy doing the work for them, they're so interesting. But the maths is a bit of a drag, and physics - as I said - I regret taking.

For someone who hasn't had the most success with us on paper, he doesn't shy away from the ball and when he has it he looks comfortable. He looks even more comfortable when he doesn't have it. He knows where to be and he'll get there when he needs to be. Unlucky not to get the fifth goal against Norwich. This is what I've liked early on about Sturridge as well. Sterling and Downing could afford to implement this off the ball movement into their game as well. 

Sahin was a mistake, but only in hindsight.  Rodgers wanted a Xabi Alonso. He didn't realize that Gerrard was capable of that role (or more importantly that we wasn't capable of his 2008-10 role behind the striker). When he tried to move on the fly and put Sahin further up the pitch, it just wasn't working. I'm happy he had the sense to cut him when he did. Best for all parties and I'm certainly rooting for BvB in the Champions League. 

Looking forward to seeing Yesil in the next couple years. No point in rushing him. Hope he's patient with us. Same with Assaidi. I see us needing three out-and-out wingers on our team (we only really have Sterling and Downing). Assaidi would be a nice addition to that mix, but that might not happen until next year. 

Allen will be class. Maybe not this year, but let's not do the same thing we did to Lucas and Henderson and write him off too soon. Lucas and Henderson play with so much confidence now. You can't say the same thing about Allen...yet.

Wales was never a well defined entity prior to the annexation of the different principalities at the fall of Llywelyn ap Gruffydd's armed stand against the English crown.

They've reached a point where people believe it is an unconditonal right to have their children cared for by others. With this they have given the government an absurd amount of responsibility and power. There is obviously an aspect of it leading to an unreasonable level of trust but it also really goes to parents heads in an arrogant and egotistical way, especially mothers who think they are then the most important people in the world and are owed extremes in child services. That is, they demand to be catered to in every way and this usually means having their children taken care off. They go one about their responsibilities as mothers and how important they are because of it and then demand the government take all of the responsibility onto themselves! Which way do they want it?

The reason I think that Donna's ending is the sadest of the bunch is that her arc is the only one that doesn't really have a ""happy"" ending. Her story is a tragedy in it's truest sense. 

Donna Noble starts off in *The Runaway Bride* as a very ordinary and somewhat shrill person - this is often quoted as why people don't like her (personally I find that to be a very lazy reason) -, yet by the end of the episode Donna has changed substantially, and reveals right before the Doctor departs, seemingly forever, that underneath all that loudness and brashness that Donna Noble is an inredibly insightful and caring woman. 

&gt;""Because sometimes I think you need someone to stop you.""

I always liked Donna from the start, but that right there is when she became my favourite companion. More than anyone else (inc. Rose) I think Donna 'gets' that the Doctor isn't just a wonderful, strange man in a Blue Box but that the Doctor is a dangerous, dark stranger, and a force that will go overboard without someone to temper it. Donna sees the Doctor for who he really is, and she sees it from the start.

Then we don't see Donna again until *Partners in Crime*. It isn't clear how long exactly the Doctor and Donna have been seperated, but it has been enough time for Donna to have continued to grow as a person. Independently she correctly identifies Adipose Industries as being suspicious and endevours to find out what exactly is going on, this is quite a leap. 

*The Fires of Pompeii* once again shows how fundamentally human and strong Donna is, she is willing to fight not only the Doctor but the laws of time themselves just to save someone - anyone - from catastrophe. She's also willing to sacrifice herself for the good of the planet. 

I'm just going to skip ahead to the end, because this is quite long already and I am at work right now. The reason that Donna's ending is the saddest of the bunch is that over her ark Donna grows so so much, and as you get to know her you realise that the Doctor needs her. He needs someone to stop him, he says as much when he leaves the Meta-Crisis Doctor in Pete's world. 

Yet despite this, and all the growth Donna achieves, in the end she is left with nothing from her travels with the Doctor bar a potential ticking time bomb in her head. 

Donna's story is a tragedy of one person who does so much good for the world, and for the Multiverse and in the end is forcibly stripped of everything she is and reduced to that ordinary woman we saw in *The Runaway Bride*.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Since this is rather long TL;DR: If you dont go to games, stfu. Unless you have gone to a game you will not understand why we have this opinion, nor do you understand Chelsea (or football) culture, nor do you have the right to judge people that ACTUALLY attend the matches regularly. 

I really have to disagree with this statement, it's unbelievably ignorant and quite frankly Im surprised you would say something like this. Downvote me to hell for all I care, but I'm sick of this attitude spouted on this subreddit. 

We that go to the games create the entire chelsea culture, songs and community that you hold dear. Going to games isn't just about the results. Its about going to the bridge with your mates and the bonds you make winning or losing. Its not about the number of times you go, its the connection you BUILD to the community, club and stadium. For all those who have been to The So Bar, you know what I'm talking about.  Its why none of us want to leave the bridge. Watching a bunch of pixels isn't the same thing at all. 

We are the ones sitting face to face with the scouse or the mancs at the bridge (not on some keyboard but in person), we are the ones putting up with all the banter and quite frankly physical altercations. Its an emotional connection that you quite frankly will never understand unless you go to matches regularly. Theres no other way to put it. 

All the songs you sing is because of the people that go to the ground. We put our money, time and effort into the damn club (for many years I might add). You might buy a shirt for 50 dollars or whatever and maybe make it to the bridge once in your life, but that means fuck all. If you can't attend matches at least a couple times a year why are you even bothering supporting chelsea? Support your local. If not for the internet you wouldn't even be a chelsea supporter (btw this has nothing to do with the fact if your are American, I know plenty who go to games whenever they can and I still respect them as proper Chels)

Its not that we are better. I have no doubt that many of you have a strong attachment to the club or might be able to spout a couple of facts about Chelsea. But there is a difference between a ""fan"" and a ""supporter."" A supporter has a direct connection to the club, we are the community. Fans are just observers. 

I find it really funny that people that actually GO to games are being looked down upon because we ask that you respect our opinion and stop telling us how to support our club just because you dont like the fact we boo rafa.

Borini's just coming off injury, so it probably won't even be fair to properly judge him by the end of this season. Still, it is worth questioning the wisdom of spending 10m on someone who is still unproven, especially when 10m is a significant chunk of your transfer kitty.

Allen has, overall, been a good addition to the squad, but 15m for a squad player (a very capable squad player, but a squad player nonetheless) is overpaying, no matter how you look at it. This is nothing against Allen, but more a criticism of us always getting to players after they've had a stellar season.

Sahin didn't work out, and fortunately because it was a loan deal it didn't cost us as much as many of our previous signings gone bad.

Assaidi again hasn't played enough to really judge him, but like Sahin it's a fairly cheap deal so even if it doesn't work out it's low-risk.

Yesil looks good so far, but the proper time to judge him is when he breaks into the first team. Signs are good.

Sturridge looks the most likely to be value for money at this point, but it's only been four games so we have to wait and see.

All in all, it's not a glowing first season of transfers. I'll make allowances for the fact that Rodgers didn't properly know the players he had at his disposal within the existing squad, and didn't have a proper scouting team at his service either as well as an inexperienced managing director.

Neither are the chelsea supporters that go to the game. We boo when our team doesn't put in a proper shift (like every other team). We boo because Rafa slagged us off and never apologized. We boo because the decision to appoint him was a mistake. Chelsea has always had the reputation of having supportive fans, we rarely boo (this of course prior to the flood gates of plastics that came after 2004, not implying you or anyone here is plastic)

true,__CanExplainThat,null,null,"1. You're bringing up equal treatment of citizens under the law, ok, but there are already different gun laws for different states.  Yes, the Constitution protects states rights, but now, why would Cali and NY have stricter gun laws than other states?  I think it's the influence of the urban areas there - SF and NYC want stricter gun laws, so they successfully pushed the state to do it.  A natural progression of that ""precision"" would be to put stricter gun laws in cities, and leave the rural areas alone - the areas that are against gun control the most.  They don't want gun control, and if statistics show that gun violence does not occur or originate there, they shouldn't have to accept gun control as much.  But if cities want gun control, they should get it.  I'm not sure, but from a Google search, it looks like cities do have different gun laws.

That's near impossible to prevent, but that's better than having a flourishing black market where you can buy these things easily, or legally.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Phew, number one is that when I watch Doctor Who, I'm not looking for the same thing you are.  I never put as much thought into the relationship between the two as you did, so my reasons for disliking her are far more superficial.

I'm not after a deep and meaningful relationship between the Doctor and his companions.  I appreciate the variety of relationships that the Doctor has with his companions and I realise that those relationships are a core part of what makes Doctor Who so wonderful, but I could never imagine the Doctor as having a (human) companion as a soul mate.  It didn't make sense that a 900 year old alien finds a soul mate in a young human girl.

The whole Bad Wolf bit and leaving the Doctor behind wasn't particularly tragic for me, it didn't grab me.  Donna losing her memory, for example, was far more tragic and grabbed me far more than Rose leaving did.  To be honest, my main reaction to Rose leaving was ""thank god for that, I wonder who the next companion will be"".

The last reason is the way Billie Piper played Rose was fairly annoying.  Billie Piper didn't blow me away as an actress.  A bit whiny, a bit clingy, simply not what I like in a companion.   As a character, I don't think she can keep up with some of the companions who I thought were awesome - Leela, Romana, Donna, Amy.

If anything, I'd wager the reason nothing happened is because the Doctor took the young Kazran into the future, as opposed to the old Kazran going back into the past.

true,Bloop2012,null,null,"I see what you are saying on the equal treatment under law issue. However what we are discussing here is a national federal statute banning and or restricting the sale of certain firearms. Municipalities and States can have differing laws, but federal statutes have to be mandated and equally applied over the entire country.

A federal statute is held to a higher standard because all federal law is based on powers granted to the federal government by the Constitution. Citizens of states elect their own state level governments and are bound to live by the laws enacted by that government. If a citizen of New York no longer wants to live under the laws of the state of New York, then they can pick up and move to Virginia. But in both states, the person would still be a citizen of the United States covered under the same federal laws.

On point two, I'm going to continue to say it. Our government standing up and saying that sales certain weapons is now illegal will have exactly ZERO IMPACT on the firearms black market. Guns are brought in via the Mexico-US Border, and arrive on the literally Hundreds of Thousands shipping containers that enter the US ports every year. This is documented and well proven. I do not mention the Canadian-US border because that avenue of ingress is not as well documented where weapons where weapons are concerned. So having an illegal weapon, or converting a legal weapon to include an illegal feature (semi auto to full auto) will still be easy for those who wish to do harm to procure. If we are going to institute a weapon ban, then I want the borders to be secured and the black market to be crushed but it won't happen.

And as for non-lethal options.. Tazers are close range personal defense weapons only good for one target. Rubber bullets still kill at closer ranges, and are not good for incapacitation. An attacker at range would still be a threat after being hit by rubber bullets, depending on location. And several times a year I hear about a law enforcement officer or private citizen who relied on personal defense spray (mace, pepper spray) only to just anger the attacker and still get severely injured or killed. I'm all for improved non-lethal methods, but until we put the chance of it working up to near 100% and make it possible to use against multiple attackers then there will still be a need for firearms.

One last note... people look at gun control as a magic bullet (pun intended) for controlling violence. This is not the case. Improvised explosive devices can be created from common household items that cannot be controlled or restricted. A person with a large knife or a sword can take out many people, you just lack range. A person with a bow can still take out others at range.. If a person whats to hurt others, they will find a way to do it. I do not believe that gun control will stop these tragedies, it will simply change the method of the violence.

Leela was interesting because the nature of her character took the ""fish out of water"" aspect of companion development to a whole new level.

They were trying way too hard to make the show 'edgy', which meant doing things like shoehorning in gratuitous sex and shots of the team looking 'cool'. It was seriously cringe-inducing at times. The second season fixed some of these problems, but the quality was still pretty uneven with some good episodes and some lousy ones.

The third series was a miniseries (Children of Earth) and IT WAS FANTASTIC. I have to shout because I was blown away by how a very uneven show suddenly turned into a tightly plotted, well written, well acted sci-fi series with a unique premise. It was like a whole new show. I highly recommend Children of Earth. You can skip the first two seasons and you won't be missing much.

I'm halfway through the fourth series (Miracle Day) It still seems pretty good to me, but I'll reserve full judgment until I'm finished.

But please note that Torchwood is a very different show than Doctor Who. It's darker, more adult, less comic. It also feels smaller since the Torchwood team largely stays in Cardiff for most of the show's run. There's some crossover (like the appearance of Martha Jones and some oblique references to the Doctor), but it's much soapier than Doctor Who. There's a lot of angst and people sleeping with each other and fighting about relationships, which can get tedious after awhile.

[The original Tube maps](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Tube_map_1908-2.jpg) were geographical (they actually just overlaid the tube stations and lines over a standard map). They actually kind of sucked because there were extra stations at the far ends that they had to crop off because they couldn't fit on the posters.

Then this guy called Harry Beck showed up in the 30s and decided that since everyone was travelling underground the actual geography of the map didn't matter, just as long as the topology of the lines could clearly be seen. So he made a map with all the stations joined up with straight lines and diagonals, with interchange stations clearly marked, with the only geographical detail being the River Thames, so you could tell which stations were on which side of the river.

The Tube authorities didn't really like it but released the simplified map in a pamphlet anyway, not expecting it to be popular.

Half the times it's about fixing something that the doctor had told her NOT to do. Every episode i started with ""what is rose going to mess up this time"". Again it's her immaturity.

But the main reason I dislike her is because she is selfish.  She doesn't care about her Mom's happiness, or Micky's happiness.

She doesn't care about those that care about her and hurts them along the way.  I don't care how sympathetic you are towards and murderous monster, you shouldn't treat your mom that badly.  Don't get me wrong, Jackie is pretty much a terrible person, but still, she cares about her daughter who leaves her without a thought.

When he meets Rose, he's just come out the other side of the Time War: his entire species, a once-great empire, is gone, and he's the only one left. He's seen horrors beyond imagination, awful, vile creations that came to be as a result of the never-ending conflict. He's disturbed, he's lost, he's lonely, and he doesn't know what to do with himself. It was a dark point in his life, and meeting Rose is what brought him out of it. She helped him find himself again: he became happier, more outgoing and talkative, more willing to open up and trust again. I read somewhere on this subreddit that the 10th doctor was, really, Rose's doctor: the man (time lord?) that he wanted to be for her: funny, free-spirited, and always energetic, yet moral, idealistic, and an all-around good guy.

River, on the other hand, isn't that sort of motivator for the Doctor. They meet when the Doctor is fully recovered from the trauma of the Time War, and she is, in many ways, radically different from all of the ideals he strives for (most of the time): nonviolence, compassion, forgiveness, etc. She is brash and compulsive, yet the way she acts is just foreign enough to the Doctor to be alluring: combine that with the fact that she absolutely adores him, and you get an entirely different dynamic than the Doctor had with Rose.

As to what would happen were they ever to meet: well, you know what I said about how 10 was very much Rose's doctor? Well, 11 is, in a lot of ways, the same thing to River. Rose, most likely, would barely recognize 11 as the same man who was once *her* Doctor: they're very different people on the surface. River would probably be respectful of someone who played such a large role in the Doctor's life, but would much rather that she leave.

They understand and complement each other.” – Russell T Davies “What Rose brings to the Doctor’s life is completion. It’s completing a circle – he’s male, he’s alien, he’s a traveler. Between the two of them together they complement each other and discover each other. And are in love with each other – absolutely, unashamedly, unreservedly.” – Russell T Davies “It’s a love story…it’s like love at first sight, in a way.” – Christopher Eccleston “The Doctor is literally thrown into this bizarre new circumstance before he’s properly gotten himself together after saying farewell to Rose, who was the love of his life.” – David Tennant “I think Rose was unique in the sense that she loved him and he loved her back. And it was more than just a hint, it was deeply emotional.” – Freema Agyeman “The Doctor and Rose love each other. I think it’s that simple.” – Euros Lyn “She’s the one woman, the one human, that can make him better – that can make him a bigger character, a better man.” – Julie Gardner “From first holding the Doctor’s hand to a farewell on a beach, Rose is the Doctor’s reason to fight, to endure, to ensure there’s light in the darkness. Together they can achieve anything. As Episode 9 describes it, they are the stuff of legends.” – Julie Gardner “Obviously and quite overtly, really, the subtext of this show is that the Doctor is hopelessly in love with Rose.” – Steven Moffat

Well, that's all very fascinating, but *Doctor Who* lore is only as good as whoever's writing it at the time. Years down the road, when this generation is a bit older, we're on the 13th or 14th Doctor, the days of 10 and Rose are ancient history, and we've got a new showrunner in the house, he or she can easily say, ""Yeah, the whole Rose Tyler thing was a bit overdone - I can't see a 900 year old Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey falling for a 19-year old human girl"", that sentiment will possess the same validity that you ascribe to the statements of Davies, Eccleston, Tennant, Gardner and Moffat. 

The unique thing about *Doctor Who* is that nobody owns the show, or the characters. This isn't like...I don't know, David Chase creating *The Sopranos* and seeing it through to the end. The comments of Davies et. al have a very limited shelf life. If/when a future boss says that, in his/her opinion, the Doctor wasn't really in love with Rose, who could say otherwise? Sure, Davies might say ""Yes he was!"", to which the future showrunner will say ""The Doctor *you* wrote, maybe. The Doctor *I'm* writing, I don't think so."" And, going forward, that will be the rule.

Thus the falling out between Harry and Levy  worsened. 

When Chelsea nicked our champions league spot, And Harry's contract is up for renewal, Levy probably thought Harry got us as far as he could and instead of giving him a wad of cash to spend with only 1 year left of his contract, it was a better move to get a new manager in who has the potential to get us further than 5th or 4th place.

Humans have barrel shaped bodies with proportionally smaller stomach. That, along with the fact that we are upright and bipedal as a species, indicate that a) Our early diet consisted of a higher proportion of meat than that of chimpanzees and b) That we have adapted to be more efficient hunters, able to see prey from greater distances in the appropriate environments. 

Personally, I don't really agree with all the social evolutionary reasons that followers of the paleo diet have. I also don't think that long term, a ketogenic diet is ideal for the human body. After reaching target weights, caused by ditching processed carbs and consuming hard to digest foods, it is probably best to switch to a diet that is mainly vegetable in nature, with complex carbs and meat, with a small amount of fruit.

But I know this: that refined carbs, in the form of sucrose, are practically unknown in the natural world with the exception of honey, dates and melons. I know that humans have selectively bred all of their basic foods to include more carbs. And that these simple carbs have a profound effect on fat gain and the neurochemistry of the person eating them.

A typical (and recent example), one the The Next Web editors, just yesterday, got told that his old, disused WordPress install (running version 2.8 or similar) got hacked, resulting in the entire server (more likely, IP) being blacklisted on email spam lists. This affected some 300 sites, according to the provider.

To be clear, those other 300 sites weren't not hacked themselves, but because one site was hacked, everyone else on the same server lost the ability to reliably send email.

Let's also be clear - likely those 300 other sites did nothing wrong, but they still can't send email.

It's a very real problem, and one that is more prolific on cheap / free hosting, where people will put up a site and then forget about it - you end up with old versions of software which over time will be compromised, and when they are (it's *when*, not *if*), it will impact everyone else on that server.

Sometimes that's 'just' the inconvenience of having your outgoing email automatically blacklisted, but if the compromise is sufficient to gain heightened access to the server, then your site can be severely impacted because of the lack of someone else to keep their site up to date.

That said, it's a measured risk - I use a combination of shared and dedicated hosting, depending on the needs of the site and my clients...it doesn't happen often, and when it does you can normally recover from it from the provider's or your own backups, but you have to factor in the increased risk of downtime and data compromise when considering the 'cheap' option.

Are you asking me to give evidence that we're a US client State?

&gt;I was actually referring to places like Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi, Qatar, where the US military has actually been invited to set up bases.

In most of those places, it's an authoritarian State inviting the US in to protect it against democracy.  The US is more than willing to protect despots who serve their interests.

&gt;Right, and because you argue government = corporate interests, media = government = corporate interests, hence media calling for that = government calling for that. I see. It does seem a little tenuous and would seem to have a requirement of some serious collusion/secret government which I lack evidence for though.

There is no independent mainstream media, almost all of it is corporate owned, all of it is corporate-financed, and much of it is laced with spooks or fed stories by State sources. Can't find the video where he says this, though it's very funny, but [here's an article](http://www.seattlepi.com/local/opinion/article/All-the-news-that-s-fit-to-slant-1198919.php) Fisk wrote about the problem.

&gt;Link please :)

It was posted on this sub and world news.  It's a very shaky source, but very worrying if true, and the particular emails may well be a ""sexing-up"" of the leak.  Commenters were able to show that the IP addresses and headers linked back to Britam Defence's ISP, so it's likely the leak itself was genuine though.  Most of the relevant links were deleted (presumably for doxxing).  Anyhow, [here's a google search on the story](https://www.google.com/search?q=britam+defence+servers+hacked&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a), pick your source (none of the mainstream media investigated it to my knowledge).

&gt;Still, if he said that 2 + 2 = 4 xD

He was accused by an opponent, perhaps Stalin, of concurring with the fascists on an issue, and he basically said, if they're right on that particular issue, whether they're fascists or not is irrelevant, the point is still true.

When you need real world experience for programming is what you deal with the stuff that's difficult: people. The elicitation of what a program *actually needs to do* from a client is difficult. Systems architecture virtually always involves people at some point, and again, that adds complexity which cannot be formalised. 

Schools should spark and foster interest in computer programming, and I think for that you just need people who know how to program a bit (any computer science grad who decides to teach).

Oh, don't get me wrong, I think people do bear (at least some) personal responsibility where information about health concerns is in the public domain.  But, obviously children less so for their parents' purchasing decisions (even when these are pressured by the child's own demands).  However, it's clear that the industry has tried very hard to muddy the waters and to resist adverse material being made public, and they should be made to pay for this and the unnecessary deaths it has caused, just like the tobacco industry had to (to a limited extent, although they continue to play the same game out of the publc eye in the developing world).

As other people have already mentioned, no, Stewart Downing is not worth 80k per week. But he's doing a good job out there and he's been fairly consistent at it for the last 6-8 weeks. Some of the best wingers don't always look up for a cross because they know if they put it into a dangerous area there will be 2 or 3 of their attackers in the box. We don't currently have that, but we're getting there. Lifting your head up does help you pick out your cross, but it also slows you down a step and may lead to your cross being blocked.

He consistently tracks back on defence and while we used to be able to say the same thing about Sterling, it seems he's lost that part of his game (fatigue?). 

I don't know. Carroll for the most part didn't seem to be putting in a shift, except for a few games here and there. Same for Cole. I wasn't really sad to see them go. I think Downing has thrown it all out there and deserves to be rewarded with a few more months. If he's still not the answer, then let's look at our options in the summer. 

But try and find a 28-year-old winger who is better than Downing that will come to Liverpool for less than 80K. With age usually comes a higher wage, and agents will expect Liverpool to pay like the big team we tout ourselves to be. And I say 28 because we need some experience.

Beyond that, MAYBE a CM to replace Lamps, because whether he leaves this season or next, were going to need to replace him soon and Josh McEachran isn't ready for that role I don't think. Also, maybe a CB if Luiz is going to play in the midfield.

Disrespectful tone used to describe something for everyone - which is the nature of compromise. Still, at least you admit that the design excluding the rest of the UK leaves out unionist aspirations.

I note you're happy to accommodate:

&gt;One small issue is those isolated maps of NI drive a lot of nationalists nuts.

Yet complain about a 'screaming' unionist? Once again you build up a false image in your head and allow it to seep into your responses. Indeed your responses are the only things that have been screaming. I've been very dignified about it and unlike you refrained from any language which would be deemed otherwise.

&gt;But we'll let the voters decide.

It's well known there's a large number of [irate nationalists](http://www.reddit.com/r/northernireland/comments/17gzka/a_new_header_for_rnorthernireland_join_the/c85t4gm) on this sub, so listening to their guidance on what it means to compromise isn't going to render much insight. Either you support the spirit of compromise or you don't.

I'm the oddball here in that I'm at the Bridge religiously for roughly half  the season and am in the US or somewhere else waking up at silly o'clock to watch the other half of the season, though my pond-hopping ways have only been noteworthy over the past 5 years, the 15 before that were seasons where I was at most of the games

Frankly there are many people at games who don't look terribly interested, be they tourist, invited guest or just apathetic for some other reason, while I've seen raw emotion watching 4am games in LA or 3am Champions League games in Shanghai. The setting doesn't matter, a brief conversation will tell me all I need to know about how much of a fan you are and even in here it sometimes becomes quickly apparent how long/committed someone is in to Chelsea

To play Devil's Advocate, there are certain occasions where more abrasive commenters here have tried to correct me about specifics about the match day experience or games at the Bridge, they themselves having never been. On those comments there is a huge temptation to be arrogant in kind and play the 'home fan' card. 99% of the people here are polite and respectful for the most part so those abrasive comments are few and far between. In any case, match going fans are a great source of unique information and viewpoints but the serendipitous location of your home can't and shouldn't be used to beat others over the head

Edit: Forgot to say, those match going fans have to put up with a lot of grief when times are bad and almost everyone in the UK is waiting for Chelsea to make even the smallest screw up, there is a big siege mentality around the club and that does rub off on the fans a lot.

Not so much evidence as reasoning, evidence would be welcome too. Don't just proclaim it though, I want to understand the thought process which has taken you from ""hum di dum I need to remember to buy bread today"" to ""Britain = client state"".

&gt;In most of those places, it's an authoritarian State inviting the US in to protect it against democracy. The US is more than willing to protect despots who serve their interests.

Yes, they are, I know. The US is pretty evil. That doesn't change *my* positions on interventionism though. You're *almost* making the 2+2=5 mistake here of assuming that because I support interventionism, that I must agree with the way the US carries it out, or their goals.

Can't find the video where he says this, though it's very funny, but [1] here's an article Fisk wrote about the problem.

I'll take your Fisk article since I respect it, but still what he points out is bad journalism and a shitty US colonol, not that there's some grand over-arching strategy of world domination.

&gt;It's a very shaky source, but very worrying if true

I don't deal in the realms of ""if"" like that, if I can help it :p - the evidence that this is true is *extremely* tenuous. Yet I'm guessing you let the possibility of it being true influence your beliefs and opinions. What if many of your beliefs and opinions are based on things you half remember which were possibly true?

On the subject of exporting culture, I definitely disagree with you as regards quality, but clearly the US wins hands down when it comes to quantity.

To be fair, there's that ""law"" that states 95% of everything is shit, and it may just mean I see a lot more of the crappy US stuff, but only the quality output from the Continent.  I'm sure that's part of it, because language obviously is a major barrier - I, like most people, loathe subtitles, so it has to be a highly recommended film for me to make the effort.

One issue is GCSE ICT - I say get rid of it and stick to GCSE Computing.  It cons parents and pupils that they are learning ""Computing"".  Here is a discription of Unit One GCSE ICT..

*""In this unit, students explore how digital technology impacts on the lives of individuals, organisations and society. They learn about current and emerging digital technologies and the issues raised by their use in a range of contexts (learning and earning, leisure, shopping and money management, health and wellbeing and on the move). They develop an awareness of the risks that are inherent in using ICT and the features of safe, secure and responsible practice.""* - Unit Two isnt much better.  The nerdy types who like programming will avoid this GCSE - then they dont tend to take it up a A level..

Teaching is another obvious issue - When we advertise for IT Teachers we get squat.  What we usually get are burnt out middle aged industry types - this isn't neccessarily a bad thing but we literally get one or two applications for a post and we have to pick someone.  Often they can't teach very well - even if they can code.  

Pupils and parents expectations can also be difficult.  Very few pupils choose to do ""hard"" subjects unless they have to.  Computing is seen as hard/boring and often attracts the nerdy types only.  Trying to get girls to A level Computing has proved almost impossible.  
Now here is the wierd thing - even the nerds aren't doing computing as much.  People will choose physics/maths/chemistry (the ""hard"" subjects) over computing - we have way more pupils (girls  inc) doing Physics than computing.  We were talking about this the other day.  It seems to be the feeling that the nerdy types value the computing qualifications less than other subjects or perhaps it is the lack of decent teachers - perhaps something else.

Personally I'd like to see all year 7 and 8s (11 and 12 years olds) do a compulsary, vibrant, stimulating ICT course with a programming element.  I think we loose too may pupils too early because they spend large amounts of time ""colouring in"" adding up numbers in Excel.

You are correct. This is the current system and I don't believe there are plans to change it, according to that article at least.


&gt;I do think the changing to monthly payments of UC is going to cause an awful lot of problems for people who have been used to budgeting on a weekly or fortnightly basis and we will see a large rise in the number of crisis loans being applied for. 

This is part of normal life? My wife went from being paid monthly to weekly only recently and we had no problems adjusting. She had about 4 weeks notice to do. Benefit claimants are getting months.

Suddenly going from having a couple of hundred quid at the most in the bank to over a thousand including his HB payment is freaking him out.

If he can't budget £69/week, how on earth is he going to budget when he finds a job?  You are part of his family, you should sit him down and explain how he can budget. 'being shit with money' is no excuse. 

If you don't want Government saying what people can't spend their money on (Tobacco, etc) which I am in agreement with, then it's not Government's place to budget for people either.

For example, it's common to attack Islam because it is homophobic. People say about Muslims: ""If they come over to Briton, they should leave their homophobia behind."" But homophobia has been a British tradition for centuries. There's still millions of Britons opposed to gay marriage, which leaves us in the silly position that when a white Briton opposes gay marriage, he's a free-thinking citizen defending his country's tradition, but when a Muslim immigrant opposes gay marriage, he's a backwards bigot who should have left his prejudices back in Pakistan.

Lucas getting injured at the start of the season wouldn't have helped either as the plans in regards to midfield strutcure would have changed after that too.

In some respects it's easier to go from monthly to weekly than the other way round.  You have the same money, just more often and if you are used to budgetting monthly it's not hard to make sure you keep money for bills etc set aside.  With weekly you are only every seven days away from pay day at the very worst. Go to monthly payments on the other hand and you suddenly have a large amount of money that has to last your four times as long.  Go a bit over budget in the first couple of weeks and you could be facing no food, heat or lighting by the end of week three.  I'm not saying everyone is immediately going to go out and buy a 50"" TV and then apply for a crisis loan as soon as UC is phased in, but there are going to be people who will see that large bank balance and struggle to cope.

Oh for fuck's sake.

1.  Yes, they are handouts.  We have a right to them when we are in need, but no one should have an implicit right to buy booze/gamble/fags at other hardworking people's expense. 

2.  Conversely, most hardworking people are happy - and even concerned - that children in poorer families *should* be fed and clothed properly.  Welfare recipients wasting money on booze/fags/etc are *hurting their own children more than they are hurting taxpayers*.

3.  Some people don't ""pay into the kitty"" even though they can, and likely never will.  They may be a minority, but they do exist.

4.  Most people that are temporarily on welfare/jobless/in strife, against their will, are seeking to get out of that situation.  Why not put some more carrot on these cards?  Make certain things - transport, printing services for CVs, postage - *even cheaper or free* via these cards.

They did introduce a form of benefit card in Australia, but the government totally fucked it up.  Firstly they required indigenous people to travel literally hundreds of miles a city to register (which cost them hundreds of dollars in shared cab fares - there are no buses to remote communities).  They could so easily have used a satellite-internet terminal, but no, they were too fucking stupid.

Then they made the error of linking the cards only with one supermarket chain.  So the cheaper, corner shops where a lot of welfare recipients shopped, lost a lot of business, and the welfare recipients got less for their money.

All that said, the Australian indigenous situation is a world apart from the UK, with different issues and pressures.  However in principle it was a valid idea.

Dembele - acknowledged by many as the steal of the transfer window and one of the best signings by any club in a long time, you cannot expect to emulate those results every signing. AND he was 15m

NOT TO MENTION, I specifically said you don't get them for less than £10million, both of those were 10million+

**EDIT** Please also note the ages of Dembele and Arteta compared to Allen... yet another factor in cost 

&gt; We need the majority of our deals to be like Sturridge &amp; Coutinho, both of whom would have cost closer to 30m combined just a year ago, rather than the 20m we paid; at least until we're back in the Champions League.

Sturridge was a want-away player that wasn't needed by his current club, Coutinho is an unproven youngster. #1 mitigating circumstances both #2 we cannot build our team on top4 castoffs and youngsters, it just doesn't work that way.

Not all castoffs are going to be as good and as synergetic as Sturridge (similar to Dembele you can't hope to make all deals as successful as that) , and not all youngsters are going to work out. 

Look at the likes of United/City/Chelsea/Tottenham, all clubs we are battling with for top4 spots and you will not see them spend less than £10mill on top-tier squad players (not even including superstars) ever. 

The only team that consistently (used to) take this approach was Arsenal, however in the last window even they have done exactly the same as the other clubs. 

Adam/Downing/Carroll are completely different to the Allen purchase and that is the part of this post I am questioning. A/D/C all three were bad purchases made as Kenny desperately tried to strengthen a team ""in his image"", Allen was a measured purchase to provide training buy-in from the player base whilst allowing us a player to move from squad player to superstar over the next few years.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"Arteta has some injury concerns, but not hugely significant ones - but that's just my opinion. As for the coming towards the end of a contract, that's part of my point - there's an effectiveness in targeting players towards the end of their contracts, rather than within months of them signing a new deal, as was the case with Allen.

Fair point, you can't emulate Dembele signings all the time. As for him being 15m, like I said, he's closer to being value for money at 15m than Allen is at 15m. And again, he's a starting XI player, not a squad man - so it's meaningless to say ""he cost the same as Allen!""

As for the point that we can't build our team off players like Sturridge - why not? Certainly not completely, but we can get a lot of quality players on the cheap that way, and given that they're coming here for first-team football rather than money, motivation shouldn't be as much of an issue either. 

(Also, Coutinho isn't hugely unproven - he's probably around the same level as Borini. Certainly not immediately Liverpool-ready, but 'unproven youngster' seems too low a ranking)

As for Adam/Downing (I left Carroll out), my point there was that we signed these players after the best season of their careers, which is also what we did with Allen. My argument in comparing Allen to Downing &amp; Adam has nothing to do with which players you think are of higher or lower quality - it's all about the timing of the transfers. 

I disagree with your analysis for the reasoning on the signings - it seems hugely revisionist to say Kenny was desperate when he bought Adam &amp; Downing, and he did it out of some petty desire to make a team 'in his image' - I mean, he barely inherited a squad from Hodgson, as evidenced when we were playing an injured Jonjo Shelvey regularly at the end of the 2010-11 season, along with the likes of Flanagan &amp; Robinson (who did better than expected but ideally should not have been there).

It was paid back with the liquidated assets of Landsbankinn, the parent company of Icesave. That's how it is supposed to be. Landsbankinn was a private company, it was not run by the government. (It was some 10 years prior, but it was privatized). The government isn't responsible for the actions of a private company, that's the nature of capitalism. The UK government allowed Landsbankinn to run Icesave in the UK and should face the consequences of their own decision. 

In Iceland, the institution responsible for monitoring financial companies (such as investment firms and banks) are heavily criticized. They should have done something. The Icelandic people are not happy about how this went. But the actions of a private company in a foreign country should not (and is not) our responsibility. 

As a measurement, this is 1.6GBP per UK citizen but 330GBP per Icelandic citizen. I hope you realize why we (the common Icelandic people) should not bear any responsibility to pay a debt that is not ours to pay.

true,Rodhands,null,null,"&gt; Arteta has some injury concerns, but not hugely significant ones - but that's just my opinion. As for the coming towards the end of a contract, that's part of my point - there's an effectiveness in targeting players towards the end of their contracts, rather than within months of them signing a new deal, as was the case with Allen.

But being towards the end of a contract is a mitigating circumstance, as players of the quality we need aren't as a general rule allowed to hit the closing end of their contracts.

&gt; Fair point, you can't emulate Dembele signings all the time. As for him being 15m, like I said, he's closer to being value for money at 15m than Allen is at 15m. And again, he's a starting XI player, not a squad man - so it's meaningless to say ""he cost the same as Allen!""

Allen is young and was definitely a starting XI player until he hit the preverbial wall. It is known as the rookie wall in American sports, that point where young players who are unaccustomed to both the physical and mental stress of their new position take a backwards step. Allen is a squad man now, at the start of the season he definitely wasn't, though IMO toptier squad men and = starting XI players, 1 step below superstars.

&gt; As for the point that we can't build our team off players like Sturridge - why not? Certainly not completely, but we can get a lot of quality players on the cheap that way, and given that they're coming here for first-team football rather than money, motivation shouldn't be as much of an issue either. 

Because 23 year old, premiership tested, internationally qualified players aren't available for cheap regularly. Relying on just bringing in these players would be a false economy, you can't ""get a lot of quality players on the cheap"". 

&gt; (Also, Coutinho isn't hugely unproven - he's probably around the same level as Borini. Certainly not immediately Liverpool-ready, but 'unproven youngster' seems too low a ranking)

Coutinho is definitely lower than Borini, his 1 international cap is from a Brazil manager that used 90+ players over the course of 3(i think, don't quote me on this number) years, and he has been given no time in a league thats anywhere near as physical as the premiership. Compare that to Borini who not only came through at an academy in the premiership but also proved he could ""hack it"" both in our system and in the premiership last year with Swansea. 

Coutinho is definitely below Borini until he is given a chance to prove things. 

&gt; As for Adam/Downing (I left Carroll out), my point there was that we signed these players after the best season of their careers, which is also what we did with Allen. My argument in comparing Allen to Downing &amp; Adam has nothing to do with which players you think are of higher or lower quality - it's all about the timing of the transfers. 

Again I ignored these recent transfers as I believe they provide a whole other conversation/debate. However if you think buying players when they have had a career year is a bad idea I would love to hear other alternatives. 

EITHER you

A) buy them before they have had their best years, in which case you are advocating buying youngsters who haven't proven themselves (Coutinho for example) and keeping their fingers crossed

OR

B) buy them when they have a down year, in which case you are assuming that at Liverpool we will be able to revitalise a stagnant career (Sturridge for example)

Now don't misunderstand me, I am happy with both of these signings and think these kind of transfers are legitimate, what I am arguing is that buying players after their career year is a legitimate business model assuming you get them at an age(or stage in their development) where advancement is a reasonable expectation. The age of A/D made this IMO not a reasonable expectation, and THAT is why the three transfers are not remotely comparable. 

&gt;I disagree with your analysis for the reasoning on the signings - it seems hugely revisionist to say Kenny was desperate when he bought Adam &amp; Downing, and he did it out of some petty desire to make a team 'in his image' - I mean, he barely inherited a squad from Hodgson, as evidenced when we were playing an injured Jonjo Shelvey regularly at the end of the 2010-11 season, along with the likes of Flanagan &amp; Robinson (who did better than expected but ideally should not have been there).

Kenny was trying to make a team in his image, that isn't petty, that is exactly what every manager tries to do... the trouble with Kenny was that he knew he wasn't going to be the manager for a long time and so tried to fix the system quick. Its obvious he favoured a style that included traditional wing play (Downing) and heavy service into a targetman (Adam/Carroll). The squad was paper thin that is for sure. 

&gt; (There's also no guarantee Allen will be a superstar).

Then lets just not buy anyone sub&lt;24, or who is worth less than £30mill, if we dont have the faith in our team to move people like Allen through from first teamer to superstar then we shouldn't be buying young players, end of.

&gt;nd then there's Africom - established in 2006. They have been trying to site [1] Africom on the continent for some time now

They have a command for every part of the world, and the only difference USAFRICOM makes is that there's a command centre dedicated to an entire continent, as opposed to Africa being divided under USEUCOM and USCENTCOM - it's not like they're getting superspecial attention now, the US just made a sensible logistical transition...

&gt;nternational [2] resistance

Those people are idiots who either don't know anything about how the US military has been run for the last 50 years or ignore that knowledge in favour of rattling cages.

&gt;so it is currently based in Germany.

All Commands are based in friendly countries. Most are in the US, USAFRICOM is in Germany in basically the same location as USEUCOM, which makes sense because USEUCOM transitioned their African command elements to USAFRICOM. There has never been a precedence of the US setting up serious command structures outside of either occupied Germany, WW2-time Britain, or the United States.

&gt;so it is currently based in Germany.

It is disingenuous of *someone* to represent this as a case of inability. The US would almost certainly not be interested in locating theatre level command assets in potentially hostile countries.

&gt;Africa is now the US's major source of crude oil, and it is estimated it will account for 25% of its supplies within a couple of years.

But I agree with what a few people have said and that it was Billie Pipers portrayal that made the character come across as annoying. Then again there are certain things about her character that I didn't like and the writing of the relationship at times, it seemed as though she fell in love too easily and she too easily ditched everyone for him. 

Also everyone seems to have their preferences and bias of certain companions (like you obviously do). Which explains certain things that annoy me when it comes to people arguing a point they favour strongly. Rose never actually ventured into the Pit with the Doctor to confront Satan and also saying Davis created the characters...what the actual fuck...I know you just mean 10 but that wording.

Also she was common, most companions are, she was brave, again meets the common criteria for companions same with caring, strong and human, with the exception of K-9 and Romona from the top of my head. Seriously, in these regards she isn't common as a person but as a companion. She wasn't even the only companion to sacrifice herself, well attempt to at least, I mean just look at Adric, I know he wasn't as liked, given he was fairly arrogant and intolerable and wasn't blonde with boobs but that doesn't change his sacrifice and the effect it had on the Doctor when he regenerated with memories of Adric being among his last. And speaking of carrying on without the Doctor what about Sarah Jane? 

Now you're last paragraph actually highlights the problem I have with the new series 9 was introduced and so Rose who was designed to fall in love with him and then comes along 10 who is more or less designed to be Rose's Doctor, the new series has become too focused on the romantic notions of the Doctors life, which annoys me, especially when I re-watched series 2, it isn't what the show is about. Although compare this to the Doctor/River romance/story I much prefer it because it is being shoved in my face constantly and with them and the stories they're involved in (other than A Good Man Goes to War, Let's Kill Hitler and Wedding of River Song) the adventure takes a lot more precedence and their dialogue reflects that, where as with Rose I felt reminded way more often within in an episode that they fancied each other.

Just remember everyone has their preferences though and I understand where you're coming from but, just saying (again) you're being fairly bias and have clearly made up your mind about the situation.

&gt;We have US forces occupying our soil that we can't eject or control, that's not good either.

You say occupying, I say based in. We can't eject them? I don't see why not.

&gt;We can't fire our nukes or launch missiles without their okay, another check.

What they say:

&gt;But we cannot fire a cruise missile except as part of an American operation. We have never had an independent nuclear deterrent, and do not have one now. 

But that's simply not true. I mean, it's just not. We can and do fire cruise missiles at will, and operational control over the SLBM's rests with the prime minister and whichever captain happens to be at sea. The mere fact that this article is clearly conflating cruise missiles and ballistic missiles leads me to believe that the author lacks any sort of clue about what they're talking about. I mean, this isn't just an opinion I disagree with, this stuff is factually incorrect. For starters and most glaringly we've had an EU developed cruise missiles in the arsenal since 2002.

&gt;so we're currently still reliant on them for that too.

Misrepresentation! At no point has Galileo stalled due to the US being antsy about it. We're not ""still reliant"" upon them because they've slowed us down, we're still reliant on them because we haven't built our own one yet, and, thanks to the Americans, we've all had free access to GPS sats for almost 20 years now.

&gt;We're effectively not allowed to declare war without their approval, or at least acquiescence.

&gt;That is manipulation in an ideological way. But they also manipulate society in more direct ways, changing how we look, eat and raise our babies just for starters.

They shouldn't though. There's a place for free medicine in our society, but that shouldn't dictate the way we live. There is no point in living if you live only to keep on being alive. We must make our own judgements about what we choose to do in life and accept or reject risks individually. Virtually everything you do is dangerous to *some* degree.

&gt;Fixing problems is always harder and more expensive than preventing them..

It shouldn't be up to society to dictate how people live their lives. If we want universal healthcare then we must accept that some people will need it more than others. If we can't accept that, the solution is not to start dictating to people how to live their lives, but to abolish the NHS and start a system where people pay based on risk factors (not something I'd like, but if people can't accept the former then they should accept the latter).",0,1359549139,null,0,false,0,c867t6z,t3_17hipf,t1_c867t6z,t1_c867lq3,null,1431128343,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,isyourlisteningbroke,irish,Plastic Paddy,"I realise that it's a complicated issue. I'm reacting merely to the extreme examples given, i.e. the 'Sharia Zones'. That has no place here, under our law and yet it has become a thing through a refusal by some to integrate themselves more.

I have no problem with people having their own beliefs and values. I was raised with some values that I've strayed from and that puts me at odds with my own family, so of course there's no black and white. But if I was to go to another country, I would expect to adapt to some form of their way of living. I couldn't reasonably believe that 'this is how we do it back home so I'm going to keep doing it here'. 

I realise that the 'Sharia Law Zone' thing is a DM reader's wet dream and certainly isn't the norm, but the fact that it exists (I'd heard of it a year or so back) is worrying.

&gt;Television news footage last week showed incidents filmed on a mobile phone on a Saturday night, in the borough of Waltham Forest, of men shouting “This is a Muslim area” at white Britons.

This is just as bad as White people telling Muslims that they're not welcome here, and worse, in that it's willful segregation by the immigrant community themselves. That can serve only to deepen divisions.

Years of writing history essays mean I'm conditioned to see both side of an argument, so I do have to climb down and admit that this sort of thing goes on with 'White Britons' too, but gets far less publicity because it doesn't fit with the media agenda to present news designed to make the middle classes feel uneasy and as such, I've sort of fallen into their trap.",0,1359549564,null,0,false,0,c867v7b,t3_17iwic,t1_c867v7b,t1_c867230,null,1431128367,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5
true,koptimism,lfc99,,"&gt; But being towards the end of a contract is a mitigating circumstance, as players of the quality we need aren't as a general rule allowed to hit the closing end of their contracts.

Except it happens more often than you'd expect - see Lewis Holtby as another quality example. And fine, even if they don't run towards the very end of their contracts, you can also sign players when they haven't just signed a brand new contract.

&gt; Allen is young and was definitely a starting XI player until he hit the preverbial wall. Allen is a squad man now, at the start of the season he definitely wasn't

I'm not sure where Rodgers figured Allen would maintain a first XI spot long-term with the likes of Lucas, Gerrard &amp; Sahin. Even now that Sahin's left, Allen is unlikely to displace Lucas or Gerrard anytime over the next 1.5 seasons at least, unless something majorly messes up. There's no question he's a good player, a good squad member, and potentially in the long term a first XI player for Liverpool; at no point have I disputed his quality. I'm just talking about the fact that we did overpay for him.

&gt; Because 23 year old, premiership tested, internationally qualified players aren't available for cheap regularly. Relying on just bringing in these players would be a false economy, you can't ""get a lot of quality players on the cheap"".

You don't rely on those signings, but you certainly do look for them and exploit them, as opposed to signing players for inflated prices after the best season of their careers.

&gt; Compare that to Borini who not only came through at an academy in the premiership but also proved he could ""hack it"" both in our system and in the premiership last year with Swansea.

Borini played for Swansea in the Championship. As for how much of a step up it is from the Championship to the Premier League, see half of Aston Villa's squad.

&gt; However if you think buying players when they have had a career year is a bad idea I would love to hear other alternatives.

I think it's an awful idea unless the player chucks in a transfer request and/or is running down a contract. It's the same as buying a player on the basis of a Euros/World Cup performance, and we fucked up big-time after that once as well under Houllier. Adam I can somewhat understand considering Blackpool were relegated, but there is absolutely no way that Downing would ever be able to command the fee he did again, especially given nobody else was after him except us.

Unless someone is in imminent threat of being purchased by someone else after a career year, you wait either 6 months or another year, and see whether they can carry on that form. If not, you decide whether they're still worth it, and if you still think they're worth having you get them at a lower price because they're not in the form of their life; if they're still doing brilliantly, then the rise in price is compensated for by the fact that they now have less time on their contract.

&gt; buy them when they have a down year, in which case you are assuming that at Liverpool we will be able to revitalise a stagnant career (Sturridge for example)

But there's a difference between the down year Sturridge had with Chelsea before we bought him and the down year Downing had with us last year - one is the result of factors external to the player himself, the other is partially (arguably largely) due to the player underperforming. Sturridge was no less a quality player last year than he had been the year before - he was just stuck on the bench behind a 50m trophy signing.

Good point about the importance of age regarding the career year thing, though. That is another thing that does make the Allen move a lot more sensible than Downing, but I don't think it makes Adam &amp; Downing incomparable with Allen either.

&gt; the trouble with Kenny was that he knew he wasn't going to be the manager for a long time and so tried to fix the system quick

Eh? There's no evidence of that - if he wasn't going to be the manager for a long time he wouldn't have got a 3 year contract, same length as Rodgers'. If anything, Kenny built a squad thinking he *would* have more time than he got - hence signing youngsters like Henderson &amp; Carroll for a top 4 bid, and giving Henderson especially way more league time than he deserved. 

We both agree on the style of football Kenny wanted; my issue is your analysis of his motives. Fair enough, every manager builds a squad in his image; I think I misinterpreted your meaning when you first typed that statement.

&gt; Then lets just not buy anyone sub&lt;24, or who is worth less than £30mill, if we dont have the faith in our team to move people like Allen through from first teamer to superstar then we shouldn't be buying young players, end of.

I think you misunderstood me - I'm not saying ""Allen will definitely not be a superstar, don't bother buying him at all"". I was just surprised at how certain you seemed that Allen would be a superstar.

All in all, I still think Allen was a good buy, and we certainly didn't overpay for him as much as we have for players in the past - but we can't consistently buy players for 15m+ that are not regularly playing in the first XI. I'm also not saying all our signings should be top club exiles - I'm just arguing for more sensible spending of the money we have, limited as it is until we return to the Champions League.

Rodgers' first window hasn't been a waste of money like Comolli &amp; Kenny's, but it has had small amounts of wastefulness - the likes of which is fine as a one-off, especially in his first season as manager, but shouldn't become a regular habit.",0,1359549610,null,0,false,0,c867vf5,t3_17iys6,t1_c867vf5,t1_c867nrl,null,1431128368,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

true,playingwithknives,null,null,"There's a massive difference between various Hasidic sects too, i remember seeing an eye opening documentary, following a highly likeable Breslover jew called Ari, the film maker followed him on a pilgrimage to Umam in the Ukraine and to Jerusalem where he was attempting to find a nice wife for his son, a bit of an issue with marriage arrangers in the UK due to him being a convicted fraudster. He mainly came across as a really nice bloke who loved a good piss-up.

The other guy, Gaby Lock, also a likeable bloke, had no truck with the Eastern European Hasidic Breslover jews and their ways, and comments on various websites after the documentary showed many didn't like Gaby* either. 

Nothing was particularly malicious though, no burnings and murders like between Shia, Sunni and Bahai.

Found the documentary. Essential if you want a non-biased view of Hasidic life.

edit: I found [Gaby's blog] (http://gabylocksworld.blogspot.co.uk/). Without even going into the content, as many here wouldn't agree to his views on certain things they are down to his age and his religion and they are his views I accept that even though I personally disagree. However all will surely agree about his atrocious use of Cap Lock. Years of posts, all without exception in capitals. Ah thine eyes bleed. Oh and the comments! A strange circle of personal trolls follow him about and there are many in-jokes and comments no one else would get and its all very sweary. It truly is another world.

true,AnnieIWillKnow,EN,england,"I am so sick of being told that if you don't like and support Benitez, you're a terrible fan. And don't boo or abuse him, because he's a special flower and his feelings might be hurt. I get dragged into the argument time and time again.

Because it's so 'embarrassing', apparently. Embarrassing that we have fans who disagree with aspects of how the club's being run. Embarrassing that these fans follow the team all around the country, and pay their hard-earned money for the right to voice their opinion. I think this really is where the difference between being an English fan and an American fan is highlighted - like EnglishMD says, we have to put up with an awful lot more grief from fellow football fans and the media, and as such are loathe to see our club and fans being criticised from within.

OP is right when he talks about people taking their frustration out, but just as he doesn't think it's constructive for overseas fans to be criticised by home fans, I don't think it's constructive for any of our fans to wander into [1] /r/soccer and criticise our club and fans with these same tired lines. We're supposed to be sticking together, not opening avenues for other clubs to attack us. It's just making the situation worse. If you live in England, you get these criticisms all the time, and being attacked from within just means we're surrounded. This makes the siege mentality worse, and makes everyone more likely to lash out.

Everyone I know knows I'm a Chelsea fan. Every newspaper fills their front and back pages with our affairs. Everyone I know understands the ins and outs of our situation, and uses this. The likelihood if you're an American fan is that most people around you wouldn't have an intimate understanding of what's going on in English football. Hell, that the ballboy saga was on the front page of an American newspaper was big news in this sub - whereas it happens all the time in Britain. Football is *the* sport in Britain. It's probably the biggest news-maker, and for all its growth, that just isn't true in America. This means you can duck out of the situation - ignore it for a while and go about your life without having that criticism coming in at all angles. We can't. I follow tennis as my second sport, and that can be at any time, so I know it as maddening as hell to stay up til 5 in the morning, only to see the player or team or whatever you're supporting lose, and I know it's a sacrifice of sorts. But it's so frustrating coming into [2] /r/chelseafc and seeing these same criticisms again and again, or going into [3] /r/soccer and seeing even more Chelsea fans criticising you, and all other fans jumping in as well, until it's just one giant circlejerk. And then we're completely surrounded. I know for sure that's what makes me more belligerant.

The increase in petrol prices over this time has been roughly in line with general RPI inflation. Also over this time overall motoring costs have significantly decreased, making driving cheaper, part of why there's been a huge increase in the UK's total miles driven.

I think the rest of my fellow Americans are blinded by the entire idea of going to the Bridge and saying how they would never boo at their team. Have you honestly never left a baseball game early? Did I boo Cardinals fans when the White Sox beat them 20-6 in 2006 and most left by the 5th inning? No, they drove all the way from St. Louis to watch their team get shit on and had a long drive home. Do I scream at the top of my lungs at Chicago Fire games because they won't get their shit together? Yes, a lot. The bottom line is that people who go to the Bridge are paying their  hard earned money to watch their team play and want their moneys worth. It's a slap in the face to travel and pay for a ticket just to watch your team not play to their potential, have someone who manages your team not fix anything when it's clearly not working, and then get shit from different club's fans.

true,Carefree88,present,Dennis Wise,"This will always be a tough subject, I just want to point out a few things.

- Chelsea have only been a super club since 2004 before that we were a 5th to 10th team, would go on a cup run every so often. However what we lacked in trophies, we made up for in passion. The Bridge was a tough place to go and our support was loyal. However 2005 came, the money came, the success came and the tourists turned up at the bridge. At first it was novel and exciting but over the years it has slowly began to kill the atmosphere. 

My perfect example is in 2007/08, when in the Harding stand a young friendly American (mid 20s) sat down next to me and asked me a few questions before the game. Like when did the club start (to his surprise it was 1905), who were Tottenham and why did we hate them, who was  the manager and where did he sit. As the questions went on, It began to annoy me because this was MY club, this was MY stadium and this perfectly friendly man had turned my passion into a theme park. I dont know why but this really annoyed me and still does when i go to the Bridge.

- I agree that a foreign fan's opinion is as important and valid as mine but I will say this, those that watch the game in with the stadium see so much more that is going on in the game then those that see a tiny portion of the pitch on the screen. For example Mikel, who often divides opinion between the stadium fans and the television fans, this is purely because when he has the ball you always see him complete a pass, but in the stadium we see him kill the play and not pass into a forward position. instead he will always play it safe to the defence. which when it is 0-0 at 75min is infuriating.

Respecting each others opinions is vital, but if a non-attending fan told me that my actions and opinions at the bridge (or away) are a disgrace to the world wide chelsea fans I would not listen because they are wrong, they were not there.

Sidenote: If any one wants to watch a chelsea game and understand the real passion of the fans then my tip would be go to an away game. However don't go all at once as our away support is really good and we don't want tourists ruining that as well. ha.

cannabis is (generalising) two things, THC and CBD.
over time the concentrations of both of these have risen due to more fresh crops, better growing techniques and selective breeding effectively. 

WHAT REALLY MATTERS IS THC TO CBD RATIO! 
you can have as much thc as you desire in your buds, however the cbd is necessary to maintain the balance of the herb.

Well, last time I checked it isn't illegal to have taken drugs; it's illegal to be in the possession of them or under the influence of them whilst in charge. If it isn't illegal, and you can't measure any performance that is lost as a result of them having used drugs at any point why should you sack them? 

Also, if people are genuinely dependant on substances there are probably some emotional issues that go along with it; if they loose their job I doubt it would help their substance abuse problem. Long term addicts are sick, not criminals.

But that isn't what this kind of statement is about; this statement is about the submission to authority; the ""grandfather"" state principle where police and other members of the establishment should be listened to like a slightly removed member of your family.

true,herb-nerd,null,null,"you misunderstand, cannabis is a plant. a genetic genome. the psychoactive constituants of cannabis have not changed. there are no new cannaboids. 
however i understand the point you intend to make and can say that the variances you have experienced from cannabis use years back and today is simply potency. 
in the 70's you were drinking shandy 0.5%, nowadays we drink beer (5%).
is it any more dangerous? no. you just consume less.

now to clear things up more, there are two (well three, one being hops that make beer, bet you didnt know that!) species of cannabis plant. 
indica and sativa
indica has a much higher CBD to THC ratio producing a relaxed, anxiety free and drowsy effect (cbd is a potent antipsycotic) 

sativa has a much higher ratio of thc to cbd and produces a more cereberal ""high"" feeling that may be characterised by confusion, englightenment, happyness, giggling - generally your typical cannabis high. (thc is a psycotic)

so both thc and cbd are needed to create a balanced high, as thc is a psycotic and can produce symptoms of psycosis (bearing in mind this is very temporary and caffeine is just as effective as inducing psycosis). 
however the cbd being a very potent anti-psycotic will negate all these effects. 

the confusion begins with cannabis nowadays being more sativa dominant (in the hybrids of breeding) so the goverment tests the thc content and it is say, 4 times higher than the 70's, they immediately believe its 4 times as bad. however they fail to acknowlage the increased cbd that balances this. 

in summary my friend, you have been severely misguided or misinformed, and i do not mean to be rude. but honestly the misinformation about cannabis is unfathomable. 

if you do not believe what i say, then please go to www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
and read some REAL information on cannabis use. these are peer reviewed medical studies performed by the most respectable education and research institues in the world. 
once you have read about the pro/ cons of cannabis. (there are cons of course! eating a hamburger every day will kill you eventually!) 
have a search for alcohol and comparisons of alcohol/tobacco/cannabis and you will see that infact cannabis is one of the safest and most misunderstood herbs of the world and its demonisation by society boggles the mind of any intelligent individual with objective intentions. 

sorry if that felt like a rant, but people must really understand that a new paper, a police chief and a politician have no authority to make judgements and annunciations of the harms of a substance they know no more about than they do the mineral makeup of pluto!

leave it to those who are objective, non-bias, qualified and competent.

true,herb-nerd,null,null,"ill be very general here, two sub-species of cannabis. indica and sativa. 
INDICA = more CBD than THC
SATIVA = more THC than CBD

when you breed the two you create hybrids wich allow you to control the thc to cbd ratio and in turn the effects produced.

THC = high, giggly, happy, floaty, enlightened, focused (but also paranoia, anxiety ect) - thc is generally known as a psycotic (by replicating the effects of psycosis) 



CBD = slow, relaxed, anxiety free sleepy stoned feeling. CBD is a very potent anti-psycotic and not considered psycoactive. 

it is this ratio that keeps a balance thc negates the bad effects of cbd and likewise. 

nowadays sativas are more popular and growing techniques have improved causing the government to state this new psycotic weed will cause you to go crazy, its absolutely ridiculous that out governing bodys know less about this than me! a 20 year old male with no qualifications in the subject but the ability to read and access medical journals on the internet.

in summary, you are feeling the effects of a high thc:cbd ratio that you are not used to (back in the days it was more CBD than THC)

my advice to you, smoke less! and slowy until you are comfortuble. if i gave you a bottle of vodka after a year of no drinking and you down it then complain it fucked you up, you would surely know you drank too much vodka, not that vodka was bad. 

otherwise, if you have friends in the know. get them to get you indica dominant strains that wont produce the negative effects you feel. 

with sativa - smoke less
or smoke indica

for further reading form a REAL reputable source please refer to this website www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/

they are real peer reviewed medical journals with no bias and nothing but scientific truth, no political skew. just facts.

people need to start listening to the qualified, objective and intelligent professionals in this field and stop listening to politicians and column writers who have no knowledge on the matter and would rather satisfy the misinformed majority for their own gain than publicise truth.

polotics has no place in science. 
yet the uk drugs advisory board see's fit to sack its most competent and professional member because his undeniably true uncovering of our governments lies and underhanded snide polices didnt make them look good.

Not being expected to integrate, I didn't want to use segregation because that implies the inability to do so.

And that's before we get to people that work for the economy but send money home (and out of the country), which even Labour have admitted they didn't consider might be the case.

I have to admit I read your post wrong and as such I retract the point I was making.

To address your actual point, and the wider thing I was trying to strike at, you are saying compeering the two is disingenuous so you think there must be inherent differences as to why they choose not to integrate and you imply that difference in thought is to do with money. But if a working poor immigrant can get to work, do their job, and go home why would they be thinking any more about having to integrate than the rich people?

Compare that to a working poor immigrant - sure, you get to work, do your job, and go home, but if you want to be anything more than a working poor immigrant, you have to integrate with the locals in order to advance; it's that simple.

Wearing (for example) a Burqa/ NiQab, (which is actually a cultural thing, rather than religious), is something that (I understand) you only wear 'when in foreign lands' - this is pretty much making a statement of rejection, just like any religious garb is ultimately saying 'I am of this religion, and therefore superior to you if you do not worship my God' whether the wearer intends that message or not.

Willie is on record complaining about Inquiries like that for Bloody Sunday and Pat Finucane. Without resorting to 'whataboutery' can he tell us how he feels the state should deal with incidents where it has illegally killed its own citizens?

William Frazer: First off it has to be proven. There is also a duty of the state to protect its citizens in areas like south Armagh, mid Ulster, north Belfast or wherever in Northern Ireland. If there is going to be an inquiry there should be an inquiry into why that did not happen because the state is entitled to use whatever force necessary to protect its citizens.

I was thinking of [the plot against Wilson](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oG6FR03BqIQ) specifically, but there are others.

&gt;We can't eject them? I don't see why not.

So why don't they then?  The cold war is over after all, which was the ostensible reason for them being here - not military adventures in the Middle East.  Anyway, they've certainly said we can't when defending the court case brought against them by the Chagos Islanders.  Treaty commitments and all that guff...

&gt;But that's simply not true. I mean, it's just not. We can and do fire cruise missiles at will, and operational control over the SLBM's rests with the prime minister and whichever captain happens to be at sea. The mere fact that this article is clearly conflating cruise missiles and ballistic missiles leads me to believe that the author lacks any sort of clue about what they're talking about. I mean, this isn't just an opinion I disagree with, this stuff is factually incorrect. For starters and most glaringly we've had an EU developed cruise missiles in the arsenal since 2002. I could go on.

I hear your points and I'd love to address them directly, but confess I don't have the indepth knowledge.  However, whilst this might be dangerously close to an appeal to authority, it is worth noting who [the author of my link is](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodric_Braithwaite).  As ex military, ex diplomatic corps, ex Foreign Office, ex Prime Ministerial Foreign Policy Advisor and ex chair of the UK Joint Intelligence Committee, he should be fairly well qualified to know better than either of us shouldn't he?

&gt;Examples please, I need examples :)

The obvious current one would be the extradition arrangements.

&gt;How d'you work that one out?

Do you honestly believe we'd fight a war if the US said no?  The last time we tried that was Suez, and that didn't work out too well.

&gt;Wearing (for example) a Burqa/ NiQab, (which is actually a cultural thing, rather than religious), is something that (I understand) you only wear 'when in foreign lands' - this is pretty much making a statement of rejection, just like any religious garb is ultimately saying 'I am of this religion, and therefore superior to you if you do not worship my God' whether the wearer intends that message or not.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;You do realise what you just said is that if rich don't want to integrate that's ok but if the poor don't want to that's not ok?

No, I'm highlighting the economic reality, and how that means that complaining (as an immigrant) that you don't have the same choices as a retired pensioner is a bit silly.

&gt; Because all you are saying is ""the rich people have more options"" which is true of everything but does not mean that people with fewer options can't be happy with those options.

You right, they can be just as happy - but making choices that divorce you from the society you're trying to integrate with in order to earn a crust are rarely going to acheive that. This is just as true for a poor Englishman trying to get a job in a Spanish-speaking area as it is for an immigrant coming to Britain.

&gt;And people who dress in designer cloths are not sending the same message you seem intent on perceiving here? 

It's not a perception - when I said 'I undestand' it's because I found this out recently (as well as the surprise that it's not a religious dictation).

&gt;Clothing is an expression of identity, religious or other wise and integration does not have to come with the stripping of that identity.

Sure, and so is a mohican or a neck-tat. In all of these cases, they take a back seat if you're serious about finding work.

&gt;Freedom to express identity is something great about this country but clearly that should only be for people who are born here.

Know many mohican-wearing neck-tattoed surgeons/ barristers/ etc, do you? Clearly you must do, otherwise that statement would look a bit foolish.

&gt;Not having a job doesn't mean you couldn't do one and nor can those numbers be use to say anything about this given groups general ability to do so.

The first part of your statement is correct - the second part suggests you'd rather not explore *why* those numbers are what they are.

&gt;I'm temping to say more but I'm not sure I could remain civil if I did.

Yeah, learning too much at once must be hard, I guess :-)

I sat at a bar at Ramblas and we couldn't figure out where all the Chelsea fans would be (as we had walked up and down Ramblas twice). Then around 2ish we heard the singing from the Irish pub. Once we got there the day just flew by.

At the irish pub we were stood right outside the door and watched everyone being hit by the ball (so many drinks were lost). I didnt see the bald guy on the slide.

When we went 2-0 down I thought it might have kicked off a bit as there were about 10-15 fans that stormed the net and tried to pull it down which only stopped when Ramires scored.

true,hotcod,null,null,"&gt;The first part of your statement is correct - the second part suggests you'd rather not explore why those numbers are what they are.

I'd actually be very interested to find out why those numbers are like that because I'm sure doing so would have a lot to say about a vastly larger number of topics than the one we are talking about here. I'm also sure you'd read exactly what you wanted to read in to any exploration of the numbers because you are already using them blind to other factors as a way to confirm your bias.

Also, this thought popped in my head yesterday, and I'm not suggesting it will work as similar ideas have failed before. I don't know what Ba's attitude is like. He doesn't seem to want to be a superstar, rather, but just works incredibly hard to get into position. Could we use him as a CF, a little bit deeper, and his strength to hold the ball up for Torres to make runs? Let two of Hazard, Mata, Moses, Ramires be wingers and rotate to give some much needed rest? I would consider it much more if we had another back up striker, but at this point, isn't anything worth a shot to shake Torres into form?
