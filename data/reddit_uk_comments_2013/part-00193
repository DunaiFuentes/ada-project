Several clubs have expressed an interest in taking you but the one I would recommend is Swansea.'""

My only issue with that is that I see Jonjo playing in a more advanced position than as a CM, he's too prone to losing his head when he's in that central position. The Liverpool game vs. Fulham at the end of last season was a good example, he basically played himself out of the team in that match.

It will take you straight into the centre, and if you're unsure about where you need to go just ask the bus driver. It's £3.50 for an adult single ticket, or £6.00 for a open return which would allow you to take the bus back to the airport. I think from the Airport to Waverly Station (i.e. the centre) takes about... 45 minutes? Alternatively, you could get a taxi!

2. I don't have really any hotel recommendations but if you're looking for sort of mid-range hotels, I'd suggest looking for chains like Best Western or Jurys Inn.

3. Public transport is more than sufficient to get around Edinburgh. I'd suggest not getting a car at all if all you're doing is sightseeing in Edinburgh. It's a very walkable city, relatively easy to navigate. You'll find that most of the tourist stuff you'll want to do is within about 30 minutes walk of each other.

&gt;This section applies to a gathering on land in the open air of 20 or more persons **(whether or not trespassers)** at which amplified music is played during the night (with or without intermissions) and is such as, by reason of its loudness and duration and the time at which it is played, is likely to cause serious distress to the inhabitants of the locality;

Environmental health have nothing to do with it:

&gt;If, as respects any land **a police officer of at least the rank of superintendent reasonably believes** that—
(a)two or more persons are making preparations for the holding there of a gathering to which this section applies,
(b)ten or more persons are waiting for such a gathering to begin there, or
(c)ten or more persons are attending such a gathering which is in progress,he may give a direction that those persons and any other persons who come to prepare or wait for or to attend the gathering are to leave the land and remove any vehicles or other property which they have with them on the land.

and they can enter the land without your permission:

&gt; If a police officer of at least the rank of superintendent reasonably believes that circumstances exist in relation to any land which would justify the giving of a direction under section 63 in relation to a gathering to which that section applies **he may authorise any constable to enter the land for any of the purposes specified in subsection (2) below.**",0,1379238356,null,0,false,0,cc8o80m,t3_1mdenm,t1_cc8o80m,t1_cc8gp27,null,1429458077,4,false,bristol,t5_2r52c,4

You cannot press as effectively high up the pitch (key to our style) if you have fewer players up top.

Our full backs push so high up that they are almost wingbacks anyway - that's one of the key trends of tactical evolution in the last 4 or 5 years.


This formation is not really suited to the Premier League where so many teams play with so much width - you will get too many overloads down the flanks.

We bought more defenders to increase competition (see Skrtel at Utd - competition already bringing out improved performance from him), provide cover for injuries at CB and FB, provide replacements for possible future departures of Skrtel and Coates (unless they both rise to the challenge this season) while Ilori is one for the future and will probably be eased in, and i think a few people have said he can play in midfield so he will provide cover for Lucas too (correct me on the last point if i'm wrong).

You believe more members of the public and the police will report on this problem when it's legal, as opposed to now when it's illegal?  How so?

How many Americans do you think continued to purchase alcohol from the black market after prohibition was ended?

According to your feedback, the legalisation of drugs will:

* Increase the usage of said drugs
* Increase the rate of drug driving
* Not make an impact on organised crime

I do agree with your point that cannabis might be a contributing factor to mental health problems, but personally I don't believe that cannabis is the sole factor. In my experience people affected negatively by cannabis, and other drugs, were perhaps predisposed to having mental health problems - but I have no scientific evidence to back that claim up.

My guess is he's testing the water to see how the public react to the idea of another coalition... Certainly for him personally it's probably his only serious prospect of staying in government (and maybe even politics). For the lib dems it's also probably their best chance to avoid getting rinsed at the polls in 2015. Unlikely as it seems, it might also be an attractive option for the conservatives for two reasons;

* Firstly, as much as they might deplore the lib dems publically, coalition has actually been very useful for them. They can write-off unpopular decision as being *""because of the coalition""* or *""the mess labour left us in""* and laud popular policies as being conservative ideas. Between those two I can't think of a single instance where the conservatives have taken personal ownership of an unpopular policy (i.e. it's always someone elses fault). 
 
* Secondly, the chances of an outright conservative majority look pretty slim at the moment... However, labour haven't really capitalised on public dissatisfation with the coalition - in no small part because Ed Miliband has all the charisma of a wet flannel. So we could potentially be looking at pretty similar voting numbers as the last election, where no party can command an outright majority - even more so if the conservative vote gets cut up by the rise of UKIP.

Personally I can't think of anything worse than another coalition, of any sort - although in principle a Conservative:UKIP alliance would probably be most plausible, although I doubt UKIP will poll high enough to win (m)any seats in the commons.",0,1379241562,null,0,false,0,cc8okn3,t3_1mfa4j,t1_cc8okn3,t3_1mfa4j,null,1429457913,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,PJHart86,,Antrim Road,"I would 100% second the bike tour from Belfast City Bike Tours. There is also a good Titanic boat tour which leaves from Donegall Quay.

It really depends what you are in to... if you like a little bit of light hiking you can walk up Cave Hill, just 3 miles north of the city centre which gives amazing views of Northern Ireland (and beyond!) on a clear day. If you get an Antrim Road bus and ask the driver to let you know when you get to Belfast Castle (also worth a look) then you can't miss it.

If you want to see traditional old Irish pubs, the three pubs in the city which lay claim to being the oldest are White's Tavern, Kelly's Cellar and McHughes. All are worth a look.

My favourite city centre pub is probably the John Hewitt, and if you want to try some great local craft beers etc you can't go wrong. The pub is run by a charity and has a memorial to the Irishmen who fought in the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War. A very interesting place.

For food (again, presuming you want places in/near the city centre) you should check out the Mourne Seafood Bar (beside Kelly's Cellar) but the food is also decent in the 3 pubs mentioned.

If you want to know more about the political history of Belfast then a black taxi tour is probably the best thing to do. They will take you to areas that wouldn't necessarily be 100% safe for you to just rock up to by yourselves.

Hopefully that helps - feel free to DM me if you want to know more.

Children should be exposed to a wider range of sports, particularly traditional English sports like shooting and archery. Not only does it keep kids active and away from the idiot box, but it also gives them a stronger link to the country they live in.

&gt;“Guns are dangerous weapons which are frequently misused. No child should be taught to shoot until the age of 18 when they assume adult rights and responsibilities.” 

Which is why the school is teaching them how not to misuse guns. This is what gun control advocates should be campaigning for. Punishing responsible gun owners for the actions of feeble-minded people and Jamaican influenced gangs isn't the way to lower gun crime.

There's no doubt that if shooting became common among state schools it would result in injuries at some point. But it will always be a safer sport than rugby or British bulldogs.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"I certainly agree the Greens will almost inevitably see a larger return of the vote in 2015 thanks to the Lib Dems being in government... but I don't think it will be significant enough to influence the overall outcome and here's why:

* In the 2010 general election the Greens returned 265,243 votes (actually 0.2% less than they got in 2005) which earnt them a single parliamentary seat in the anomalous area of Brighton &amp; Hove. Anyone who has ever been to Brighton will know the area is well known for being politically quirky... although the Greens may poll better across the country in 2015, it's unlikely they will poll well enough in a geographically concentrated way (outside of Brighton) to actually convert those votes into extra seats. 

* By contrast, in 2010 the lib dems returned 6,836,248 votes (25 times more votes than the greens), and labour 8,606,517 votes. When you look at the swing that would be needed for the Greens to split the labour or lib dem vote (which by contrast **is** geographically concentrated) you'd be talking about ~2 million+ voters having to switch to the greens... which just isn't going to happen. No party in British history that I can think of has ever increased its vote by a factor of 10 in just 5 years, with virtually no money, no campaigning and little public understanding of its policies.

* Now if we look at UKIP, in 2010 they returned 919,471 votes - putting them in 4th place with 3% of the entire vote. If opinion polls are to be believed, UKIP now enjoy ratings of 10-15%... But what is interesting is that those votes come almost entirely from the conservatives share of the 2010 election... in effect, UKIP are the *right wing party of opposition* like the lib dems used to be for the left... but they are massively larger than the Greens.

* If anything will scupper UKIP at the next election it is the same problem as the Greens... they aren't geographically concentrated enough. So they might double their share of votes, but when you look at it on a seat-by-seat basis it means they might get say 20,000 votes where last time they only got 10,000... but labour and the conservatives are still going to come away with closer to 50,000 and by extension win the seat in first-past-the-post.

**Tl;dr: Basically what I'm saying is the conservatives are intrinsically more vulnerable to having their vote cut by UKIP than labour or the lib dems are by having it cut by the greens... who are less likely/capable of doing so**",0,1379246247,null,0,false,0,cc8p32a,t3_1mfa4j,t1_cc8p32a,t1_cc8omw1,null,1429457663,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,djhworld,uk,London/Nottingham,"I watched an excellent documentary a few weeks ago on the BBC, I can't remember its name unfortunately but it was about how a state in the US, Colorado I believe, has voted in a bill to legalise consumption of cannabis to those with a doctors note, and from next year they're planning on opening it to everyone, not just those with a medical note.

It was a fascinating documentary that explored the pros and cons of this action in a real world environment.

One of the major points of concern from the narrator was how legalisation may lead to children consuming cannabis either indadvertedly or purposefully obtaining it. A good example of this was a business man just ramping up his pot-empire, with huge crop plantations in a warehouse ready to be farmed. His main business wasn't to sell packs of weed for people to roll up and smoke, it was more a ""medicinal products"" type thing where his company made cakes, chocolates, drinks, sweets etc that had been infused with the drug.

An example product discussed in the documentary was some chocolates/sweets that had the equivalent THC amount to smoking 8-10 joints. The presentation of the packaging and the fact that they just looked like harmless chocolates was of a concern because they could easily be consumed by children mistaking them for treats.

This is what concerns me about legalisation, as soon as you let the free market onto it, businesses need to compete to differentiate their product from their competitors. This could mean making alternatives to smoking the drug, growing plants with the most THC etc

If legalisation was to occur I think the government should introduce some regulation with it too

I know we were talking about the height in the beginning, but let's just compare Coutinho and Sterling. Coutinho is very quick over the short-distance, but he isn't a player who can carry the ball away from defenders in his back over a distance of more than 10 yrds, they will get him or at least be on his laces to trouble him. If Raheem starts to run away from an opponent, they won't get a hand on him. That's not what was this little discussion about, but also an interesting thought. Also: To differ between speed and pace with and without the ball, there are also great differences. In sprints with the ball on his feet, Carroll would've be problaby one of the slowest, especially because he always seems to be quite uncomfortable with it. Sorry, that I'm mixing up different cases, but that's what came to my mind.

Cannabis contains far, far less than tobacco. Let's not forget that tobaccos primary use is a pesticide, it is designed to kill things. Cannabis inhibits the growth of cancer cells, and that has been proven in various studies. 

 &gt; Drug-induced psychosis is a little bit of a pain for mental health services too.

This is entirely because it is illegal! If it was legalized, THC:CBD levels would be more equal. Street dealers sell weed with highly concentrated THC. The whole drug-induced psychosis thing makes absolutely no sense if the levels are normalized, or if the CBD exceeds the THC, as CBD is a potent anti-psychotic and anti-depressant. It actually *prevents* psychosis and depression/anxiety, which is why high CBD strains are prescribed for these disorders in other countries.

true,smaclver,null,null,"No definitive insight but from everything I've read from Reina, Rodgers and so on, I can explain what may have happened. 

Around about January last year the rumours started about Valdes not renewing his contract with Barca and leaving for Monaco at the end of the season. As did rumours about Pepe being the one to replace him (given Barca's emphasis on its identity and its homegrown players - particularly under Vilanova who was obviously still coach at the time). 

So Reina started to look a lot sharper, lost some weight and turned in a lot of solid performances towards the back end of last season, the sort we haven't seen since Spain won the World Cup in 2010. It seems he was very keen to return to Barca (and his change in attitude may or may not be part of the reason that the club decided to replace him, see the quote about Reina not being pushed hard enough), so the club started looking for a replacement.

For several reasons, the club obviously decided Simon Mignolet was the man to replace Reina. 

However, Valdes did a u-turn and decided to stay at Barca, and the Reina deal was evidentially shelved. The club, having decided they preferred Mignolet (younger, more focused and motivated, statistically much better), were put into a position by Sunderland who according to the Sunderland Echo, wanted to sell Mignolet this summer. Kieran Westwood, who's a decent goalkeeper had been sitting on Sunderland's bench since Mignolet came in and decided that he wanted to be first choice, Sunderland preferred to cash in on Mignolet this summer so that they could keep Westwood and bring in the 136 new signings that Di Canio obviously needed. So in short, the club had to get Mignolet this summer or not at all.

Once Mignolet had signed, we could have kept Reina on for another year, but given that he was on £110k a week and wouldn't be first choice and assumably wanted to play football in a World Cup year. He agreed to be loaned to Napoli, I don't know why he bitched about it in his letter though, his agent had acknowledged the Napoli interest weeks before and any suggestion that he wasn't informed of the loan seems a bit ridiculous. 

Obviously, with Valdes Barca future still in the balance (his contract expires this summer) we couldn't agree a deal to sell Reina to Napoli, so he was loaned. 

This could all be wrong but it stacks with information published by the Liverpool Echo, Sunderland Echo, various Catalan papers and media, public quotes from Pepe's agents and interviews Brendan Rodgers gave to The Anfield Wrap and in press conferences during the summer tour.",0,1379251695,null,0,false,0,cc8pvfv,t3_1mefw4,t1_cc8pvfv,t1_cc8or29,null,1429457295,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7

I know everyone was slagging off our performance, but I don't think we were as bad as the postmatch thread would believe. We were in control of the majority of the game and their goal came as the exception. It was only until the 3-5-2 that our defence looked disjointed. Cole came off in the 69th minute, and 3 of our 4 yellows came after his substitution, when the gaps were exposed and drastic action was needed to stop them from getting through. I'd be interested to see a breakdown of shots/shots on target by half, because I think we'd see their chances were significantly weighted to after Cole came off.

I think the defence isn't our problem, it is still our attack. I don't think Eto'o is as bad as they think he is, I think he just needs time to settle, as Terry himself said. His runs already looked a big improvement on Torres and Ba and I think he will be a big help this year. I'm as annoyed as everyone else that Lukaku went out, but he wanted to go and Mourinho knows how to develop the youth. I trust his opinion over everyone in this sub.

3 at the back either means we have one less in the CM position or we lose the fluid front 4. Neither options seem smart.

In states and countries where it is legal, people have no reason to use a filler most of the time. Infact when you mention it to people in the US, for example, they view tobacco in a joint as a completely foreign concept.

The reason a filler is used in countries where it is illegal is because the cost of the product is so high, and the product itself is so strong. Perhaps an easier way to look at it, is that street dealers are selling Vodka -- you need something to mix with it.

My parents are from and still live in Sheffield, they're tory voters. You're argument is invalid. My point is if you have a problem don't automatically blame the South (blaming Westminster is justified as their in charge of the country). I live in the East at the moment so we're pretty much classed as south on a national scale but we're suffering as well. We're going through a recession at the moment, bitching and whining about the current state of things and fantasizing about this glorious new north England (I still don't believe you're being serious) independent country won't solve anything. Go to Greece, Spain or any Eastern European country and you'll see just how 'sick' you are compared to others in the EU.

It's one thing to adjust specific policies to the pragmatism of being in power... but the lib dems made out that tuition fees was one of their core pledges, more than just a small-print manifesto promise -- a matter of principle that education ought to be free in a socially mobile society. Then not only did they renege on that, but Vince Cable ended up being portrayed as the mastermind behind a push to £6K, which actually ended up at £9K when the universities unilaterally decided to all go for the highest amount. The whole thing was a complete balls up, and its almost certain there will have to be some new settlement in the next 5-10 years in order to constrain the amount the government is lending in unsecured credit to students.

I maintain that even people who would typically vote lib dem actually **owe it to the lib dems** not to vote for them in 2015 - because it will send a message to all political parties that you can't get away with breaking core manifesto 'principles' like that without suffering at the polls. The whole basis of our democracy is that you vote for parties that reflect your political principles - not individual referrendums on specific policies.

Your point draws a false equivalence. Labour did not really put the ""no illegal wars"" position as the lynch-pin of their election campaign in 2001. Unlike the Lib Dems who put the Student Fees on centre stage. If Blair and Brown held up publicity photos in military towns like Aldershot with a beaming photo op promising no illegal wars then you would have a point. 

The fact is that what Nick Clegg did was wrong, he sought backing from Student Towns, launched a ""no more broken promises"" video and then dumped it as soon as he was in Government. It is quite understandable that a lot of people felt cheated.

Your point is a good one, governments dump their earlier promises quickly. That is why Ed Miliband is so fantastic at not making so many. 

Labour in 1997 introduced student loans and did break campaign promises. However on balance this was mitigated when they introduced policies such as the Freedom of Information Act (which Blair later regretted), Minimum Wage and pumped a lot of money into education.

Unfortunately the Lib Dems are in a unique position where they made some pretty hard choices and are responsible for the blows, their Conservative coalition partner get all the praise for any success.

It's up to responsible parents to keep THC-containing products away from kids. It's not as though they would be sold next to ordinary sweets on the shelf. I know a kid who ate a whole jar of multivitamins because they were tasty - he went to the hospital and was fine. I doubt a one-off consumption of cannabis medicine would go differently.

&gt; This could mean making alternatives to smoking the drug, growing plants with the most THC etc

Alternatives to smoking is probably a good thing for our lungs. Growing a plant with higher THC just means people will smoke less of it, putting less tar in their lungs.

* When I first started work around 2000 I earnt an amazing £2.995 / hr (yes... thats right, I earnt a half pence an hour). When the National Minimum Wage (NMW) introduced by labour in 1999 rolled out to 16-18 year olds my pay shot up by about pound an hour, then when I turned 18 it shot up even higher to around £5. It was one of the most overdue and socially needed pieces of legislation. It improved a lot of peoples lives... the conservatives of course resisted it.

* In 2004 Labour introduced the civil partnerships act which ultimately opened the way for gay marriage legislation. The conservatives of course fought against it.

* Labour radically increased the amount of money given out to certain groups, particularly pensioners and those recieving state welfare, but also childrens services and the NHS. Infact I think the figure is something like a 75% increase in the amount of money that went out to those groups. It made labour one of the most redistributive governments in British history - and they paid for it by increasing taxes, selling off unwanted state assets (yes, including gold at a low rate nobody could of predicted would rise - but also things like old unused pieces of MoD land) and of course increasing state credit - although at the time even the conservatives and lib dems didn't disagree with this in principle (they just disagreed with what it was being spent on).

* Iraq was pretty unpleasent all said, and even labour seem to have come to acknowledge that... But it actually dwarfs some important and genuinely impressive humanitarian accomplishments made by labour - not least the now largely forgotten 1998 Kosovo war where Tony Blair was one of very few people pushing for military action that actually saved the lives of hundreds of thousands of European Muslims. Similarly, British intervention in the Sierra Leone civil war in 2000 helped to halt a potentially genocidal civil war from destroying the small country.

**tl;dr**: After about 17 years of conservative government labour made some important and overdue changes that really helped modernise the UK.

**He was quoted as saying, ""You and I have been physically given two hands and two legs and half-decent brains. Some people have not been born like that for a reason. The karma is working from another lifetime. I have nothing to hide about that. It is not only people with disabilities. What you sow, you have to reap.""**

He also allegedly brought a faith healer with the England squad for the 1998 World Cup. So apparently he was/is some sort of religious nutter, I don't know what made him think it's okay to say something like that or what would make him believe such a fallacy. Skill wise and tactically he was a great player/manager for Spurs/England so it's sad. That was all a long time ago and to be fair to him it was 1 stupid thing he said that has overshadowed his great football and charity work, but for me personally I'll never think of him as highly as I do Ledley King or Bill Nicholson.

true,Greaseball01,pertwee,Pertwee,"Really? Well okay then. I think one of the keys was continuity, both in character and story, season 1 seemed to have less of it (Although it was certainly there) since the only episodes that really followed directly on from each other were the last two and the one where the lady who got shot in the head in the first episode came back. Season 2 had Owen dealing with the whole you know what thing, ended with a massive emotional gut punch, had the opening episode connected directly to the last two episodes, and made an effort to make the characters more understandable and relatable, rather than like in season 1 where everyone's just sort of a c*nt most of the time because they're all edgy and adult, which is another thing that p*ssed me off about season 1, I got the distinct feeling that it was trying way to hard to be edgy and dark, personified best I think in the nympho alien that feeds off of sex episode, the pointlessly gratuitous violence and over use of the word f*ck, I mean I say it a lot in normal conversation but there's a point where it just becomes poor dialogue writing. And the Cyberwoman episode was one of the worst things I've ever seen, made all the more depressing by the excellent performances given by everyone throughout the truly apocalyptic production designs and writing.

Season 2, I felt did more to flesh out the characters, since they'd stopped making them all c*nts for no reason by this point, and gave them more room to interact with one another rather than them each having their own self contained stories, and it's definitely the season that Owen got to shine the most in, and of course by the end the fact that all these characters had been extra fleshed out with much better writing throughout the season, the ending actually felt emotional, unlike season 1 where it just sort of ended and everything was fine.

Then season 3 rolls round, everybody's emotionally drained from the events before it, it starts literally with a bang, the size of the stakes are actually huge (and treated as such rather than the whole thing being sorted out in half an hour), we have fantastic new characters (applause for Peter Capaldi because his storyline in those episodes was one of the best things in it, perfect writing, direction and an incredible performance from him) who have full arcs that are completed before the season even ends, and best of all (For me at least because as we discussed, I love continuity) it was all one continuous story played out for as long as it needed to be so as to achieve the best result, making the ending feel all the more satisfying. Also, I'd probably feel pretty bad about sending millions of kids off to be painfully and slowly murdered by a bunch of three headed pricks so I'd hardly call the moral issue of whether or not to do it sanctimonious, more realistically difficult.

The weather is probably no worse here than you're used to. Very rarely drops below -5 celsius in the city. It can go lower in more rural areas.

Edinburgh is great for New Years, or Hogmanay as we call it here. There is a massive street party on New Years eve itself, which has a couple of music stages and a big fireworks show. I don't know if I'd specifically recommend this though, as it is incredibly busy and drinks are expensive. I would recommend doing the pre-hogmanay stuff though. There is a big party on George St on the 30th. Again bands, and also the worlds biggest ceildh. So if you fancy being danced down 5 blocks by burly men in kilts, you should definitely go to it. You then have the annual skinny dipping in Queensferry, which would definitely be an experience. 

For the best of all worlds I would do the 30th in Edinburgh, the 31st maybe in Glasgow, and then the 1st in Queensferry.

It is very much safe to travel here alone, for both men and women. Especially during the festive season, people in large cities are used to tourists, and are generally very friendly.

Okay, stop laughing.

Seriously.

Think about it. No-one remembers sell offs. No one remembers attempts to ban porn. There has not been some sole, single NHS thing which he is going to be remembered for, particularly compared to midstaffs. People don't remember benefits cuts which are largely popular with the public.

What will he be remembered for (assuming he loses in 2015 and gets removed as leader)? 

He legalised Gay Marriage. He gave one of the greatest speeches of all time regarding Bloody Sunday and helped heal the problems of the troubles. He (probably) will have helped keep the union together. He was Prime Minister during the Olympics and had the chance to look very prime ministerial.

He is also a moderate compared to Tory leaders before him and almost certainly the ones afterwards.

Plus, Miliband is probably not going to be a good PM if he gets there.

In addition, he doesn't have a toxic war legacy. Libya was low risk and comparatively effective and on Syria people are thankful he has respected parliament.

Granted, he's not popular now, but people hated Churchill at the time. They hated Attlee. They hated pretty much everyone, and those they didn't hate they disliked in time.

The Invitational was set up to bring about another high end UKDota event, aimed at teams with consistent lineups that have attended LANs and/or are competing continuously. Teams that will be missing from this event are:

**Karnage** - They couldn't make the dates

**Pauz PLS (Goshawk Stack)** - They do not play together anymore

**Wat A Stack** - Explanation below:

Although we initially decided to allow Wat A Stack to take part in this tournament, it's come to light that the roster is changing thus making it a mix instead of a team, or the team that won campus party. Knowing certain members can't make play dates and the fact that it would be a mix making a mockery of the actual teams competing, coupled with the fact that there are appearances and deadlines to be kept, the invite was rescinded and the next team on the reserve roster list was invited.

___

All PR shtuff aside, if ye get a solid consistent roster, I don't see why you can't take part at the next event.

Don't take it personally, we just want things to run smooth and not have people bitching about mixes in team-only events.

I suppose we can be charitable to the guy and say that at a minimum he'll draw an opposition defender, but overall should he be playing professional football? Probably not. [This is the Zamora of yesteryear](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUlJ-5t4x0E), and the guy on the field yesterday didn't look like even a shadow of him.

What annoyed me was that once subbed out, Austin was left to fill in the target man role. As I said on another thread, I'm not sure this suits the team. All the highlights of his goals over the years suggest he needs to be fed the ball directly into a goal scoring opportunity, not jumping onto the end of long balls (although any fighting for the ball is naturally appreciated). I hope Kranjcar is competent in the air, or we focus our passing to the feet.

Hitchcock's youthful pace alone might provide more opportunities than Zamora, but unless we can field AJ and Austin simultaneously, I'd stick Kranjcar, Faurlin or Carroll or whoever behind Austin.

We're a team with money to burn, first team chances over a long season up for grabs and yet we're only ever linked to Spurs/ex-Redknapp strikers.

No. She published a press report to talk about her preliminary findings.

Presumably if they were against this or disagreed with her findings, they wouldn't have published it, no? Presumably if they didn't agree that she was qualified to make such findings at all they wouldn't have chosen her to do it, right? It is not against any rule of the OHCHR to publish press releases, regardless of how many political feathers might get ruffled.

&gt;She only has herself to blame.

She would have opened herself up to criticism regardless of what she said or did, but in what alternate dimension could she have expected and anticipated to be rubbished as a loony Brazil nut who makes blood sacrifices to Karl Marx? Bit of a disproportionate response there, don't you think? Maybe just a little? Like how hypberbolicly fucking absurd does the resulting criticism have to be before you can no longer smugly say to yourself, ""well she had that coming""? Accusations of cannibalism, perhaps? 

&gt;she has not come across well on television where she has been outspoken, not particularly clear, and has become intensely politicised.

[Her appearance here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24053718) doesn't seem too outlandishly biased or confusing. She even apologises for using the term ""bedroom tax"", despite it appearing in her preliminary press release as ""the so-called 'bedroom tax'"", stating her reason being that everybody was calling it that when she arrived. It isn't outrageous bias to report that; people do call it that.

&gt;and she has not acted in enough of an objective manner

And how could she be more objective? Maybe she could be less critical of some of our country's housing policies to make things a bit more balanced?

That how it starts though. You get people to do that. If they enjoy it you now have a group of friends who are up for other stuff. When people want to do stuff they will always find a way. I always find that people either seem to do nothing or do it all. eg My main sports now are. Shooting / Windsurfing / Sailing / Gliding / Archery. Some of the thing I did at school helped make those things possible.

Here is my favorite water sport. These were taken in Bangor a couple of year ago by a passer by who left his details to somebody! We are always looking for new people to come have some fun.

We were never asked to supply an official roster, nor did WE ever infer that our roster is changing. Hearsay and rumour that you here should have no bearing. Our roster (considering JonL is banned) is and always was the team that won Campus Party (Me, Welp, Rime, Thom and Jack.) We were told that that lineup with any fifth player would be fine, as long as they weren't on the UkDota.net banlist.

Even if our roster was changing, Fullstop (no disrespect to them) have been a team less than two weeks, so our roster even if changed would still be more stable and have more achievements than them.

So saying "" if ye get a solid consistent roster,"" when we have a more consistent roster (i.e. playing with the same players) than at least Reason, Naix on a Plane and Fullstop (that I know for sure) is rather contradictory.


We were also never asked by any of the admins about any of our members being able to play on certain dates. I did enquire about the rules for standins:

foob: can you confirm whether or not wat a stack will be playing in the invitational ont he 21st? ive asked a few times and the last day to confirm is today.
Fowdall440: we are i think, but whats the rules on standins? we've got loads of people away that weekend
foob: welp just confirmed for you's so its done
foob: theres a standard rulesheet floating about somewhere but i don't have it to hand
foob: cupcake will have it seeing as he does the adminning for tourneys now

Whilst I did say that some of us would be away, this wasn't brought up as an issue nor was any further contact made about this being an issue.

I do not know what your rules for standins are, but I did inquire. The rules are not available publicly for me to view.

If we did have issues with players, how about having a team ready in reserve to play in case we couldn't muster the numbers?

Finally for now, if these were your reasons for not inviting us, they could have been discussed with us and potentially resolved to your standards in private, rather than an out of the blue news post informing us we wouldn't be able to participate after assuming all was fine after we had confirmed.

Anyway, best of luck to all teams involved.

I don't know if I can trust Aspas to be the guy to rely on tomorrow.

Edit: There are public crowdsourced databases of this info put together by wardrivers ([WiGLE](https://wigle.net/), [OpenBmap](http://openbmap.org/)) but they can't be used for location services, according to one thread I found regarding such.

Edit2: Added links, specified that this happens on devices the corporations no longer own directly. Google has since added an opt-out, but you have to opt-in to use the location services at all.

Giffgaff doesn't do any kind of locked in contract, but you can buy particular 'goodybags' (e.g. 500 minutes, unlimited texts, 1GB internet and free calls to other giffgaff users for £10 - or unlimited internet for another £2) that last a month.

If you're after the monetarily best deal, it's generally to buy an unlocked phone and go with a good non-contract plan. Contracts are a lower up-front cost, but generally a higher total extra cost than the phone would have been originally.

I'mm not sure legally where marriage stands on debts. Generally speaking if someones chasing you for debts that arent yours, you can  tell them to Sod Off. Whether thats the same for someone you are married to i dont know. This is why i think you need a debt advisor from citizens advice.

I'd say the first thing she needs to do is NOT PAY ANYONE. Secondly, she needs to a) make clear the debts are not hers and were done without her knowledge and b) ask them to only contact her in writing (this will make it much less stressful.). 

there's a section on the citizens advice website (http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/england/debt_e/debt_help_with_debt_e/debt_how_to_dispute_a_credit_debt_e/what_can_you_do_if_you_don_t_think_you_should_pay_back_a_debt.htm#what_can_you_do_if_you_don%27t_think_you_should_pay_back_a_debt)

which says:

&gt; However, there are times when you may be able to argue that you shouldn't have to pay the money back. This could be for a number of reasons, including:

&gt;     you didn't sign a credit agreement with the lender or someone else signed it

and then says

&gt; If you don't think you should have to pay back a debt you're being chased for, you should get help from an experienced debt adviser to see what you can do about it.

Which sounds pretty in your favour. 

Basically, talk to citizens advice. Don't pay anyone anything till you have talked to them. Make sure debtors know debt isnt hers, was never agreed to by her, and that they should only contact her in writing. 

anyway, i hope this helps, good luck getting it sorted out!",0,1379276740,null,0,1379276930,0,cc8y06o,t3_1mg7y3,t1_cc8y06o,t3_1mg7y3,null,1429453475,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2

It's very ""pretty"" and cultural with a lot of old stuff and a massive cathedral.  As usual with a university city there's a bit of ""town vs gown"" mentality with the locals; but it's only really North Road that you'll feel a bit nervous in if you're obviously a student.  Nightlife is pretty crap, there's only a handful of clubs if you're into that.  If you're living out, you're always within spitting distance of a supermarket which is handy for food (although the centre of town Tesco Express is quite a bit more expensive than the others).  Shopping-wise, your fairly limited to chain stores, but there're several indies and loads of fantastic tea houses; and if that's not enough then Newcastle is only 15 mins by train.

Not much else to say about it really; the weather varies from mild to fucking freezing your tits off in winter but summer's normally very nice; there're a lot of uni owned sports grounds and if you ever want to get out of the city there are frequent buses (the seaside isn't very far away) and really, a half hour walk along the river will take you completely out of sight of the city.  Oh and you'll probably get used to hearing police sirens very quickly; there are three prisons in and around Durham and the local bobbies seem to sound the sirens every time they escort a van...

The university itself is fantastic in my opinion; the pastoral care in my college and the wider campus has been amazing and I've never had a problem when I've needed to use it.

Perhaps so, but then again labourer is a job where you will actually be a bit useless when you start so it's only logical that those with experience are going to get jobs more easily.

The proper student jobs, working in bars and tesco and next and maccy D's? They still require nothing beyond being able to speak basic English.

I don't know about that. There's a huge quantity of snobbery about jobs and their value out there. Manufacturing is *always* considered superior to services.

true,Leonichol,cnty-uk,Geordie in exile (Surrey),"I find all networks on 1800MHz+ to have really patchy coverage. While EE/Orange in areas with lots of people (London terminals) data just stops working. They're also next to useless on trains. I often also get voicemail without missed calls while having good signal. Orange had a really good 'SignalBooster' app once which routed calls over wifi - great when abroad. This is gone now, massively cutting the value I place in the network. Voice quality can be absolutely atrocious ('underwater effect') for me in Farnborough, London and Newcastle. As a business user, I have a lot of hate for EE&lt;&gt;Orange, their business partners, and their price plans in general. But for personal users, EE's roaming addons are unbeatable.

Meanwhile 800MHz providers seem to have a lot better coverage for voice, but that doesn't always include 3G+. O2 has an amazing VOIP service which integrates really well with your account. They're a bit costly on PAYG though. They remain my favourite provider as they work on trains, including with data. Don't die, and don't have problems with voice quality in my locations. Their customer support is also brilliant both on the personal and business side.

Best value for money network seems to be GiffGaff (O2 mvno) and Three for casual personal use.

An often overlooked network is Ovivo (voda mvno), which I use for 3G failover.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"In fairness, the jury is out on whether or not the Iraq war was illegal. Whether it was or wasn't is largely academic anyway, since the law of what nation-states do to each other isn't quite as black and white as the law when it comes to individuals and property in the domestic sense. The only real effect would be that theoretically some politicians could be prosecuted for it... but that is extremely unlikely to happen, just look at how hard it was to bring a trial against Slobodan Milosevic who was practically caught red-handed killing thousands of his former countrymen.

Anyway... My point is really that Labour campaigned and won in 1997 on the basis of increased funding for the NHS, to cut class size to under 30, introduction of a national minimum wage, constitutional reform of the house of lords and no rise in income tax. In effect they delivered on all of those key areas with varying degrees of sucess. There were lots of ""lesser pledges"", like reform of the common agricultural policy, some of which were not met for various reasons... but on the whole, Labour largely delivered on its 1997 manifesto - its one of the reason they stayed in power as long as they did. I know people in their early 20s these days tend to view Tony Blair as a bit of a pariah, but for the longest time he was actually very popular as a sort of ""honest man"" image - and it was just a combination of the unpopular Iraq war and overstaying his time in office that change that image.

Both the conservatives and the lib dems on the other hand twisted the nature of the coalition to cherry-pick which policies from each others manifestos would actually be delivered on, and attributed anything else to the constraints of coalition. I mean *""No top down reorganisation of the NHS""* and a *""Pledge to abolish tuition fees or vote against any further rise if in power""* were big ticket pledges... by contrast Labours failure to reform the common agricultural policy in 1997 was complex in nature. The lib dems on the other hand not only ignored their manifesto pledge to vote against fee-rises... they effectively masterminded the complete opposite. Similarly, the conservatives got into power and almost instantly initiated a complete top down re-organisation of the NHS.

3. An interesting conception of the Doctor that needed an executive team that was really on board with it, not... Michael Grade. Baker's conception of the Doctor was along the lines of Mr. Darcy: seemingly arrogant, yes, but only because he didn't feel the need to explain his actions to everyone all the time. He would still be the Doctor, still the universe's trickster savior-hero, but he wouldn't necessarily be *nice*.
4. Short tenure. Baker planned that his Doctor would mellow out over the course of his planned long tenure. Fan backlash and evil imp Michael Grade put paid to that.

Bristol Uni is in Clifton, not too far from the city centre, and UWE is up in Filton, which is on the north outskirts of town so a bus ride into the centre. Looking at your selection, I'm guessing you'd be applying to Bristol Uni, so you'd be living around there and it's a really nice area - quite posh and leafy. 

Bristol has a really big wealth gap between the poorest and richest areas. The rent in the nicer areas can be high, so you'd have to houseshare if you lived here after uni. The area south of the river is much less developed and has less public transport etc. The buses are almost all run by one company - First - and they are really expensive. There are a lot of people who cycle, if you're into that. The mayor is very anti-car. Crime isn't too bad. 

As a city with two unis, it does get quieter here when they are on holiday. A lot of students stay on in Bristol after uni, and it is a young city. Jobs are mostly in engineering, healthcare (due to the hospitals), IT/web design/comp-sci, and creative industry. Some law firms also have offices here. There is an emphasis on independent shops and supporting local business in some areas (Gloucester Road etc), but our city centre is much like any other in terms of shops. The harbourside is pretty nice. Apparently there is a good music scene, but it's not my thing so I don't really know. We have several festivals on the harbourside, as well as the balloon fiesta, but they're all in the summer so you might not be around.

&gt;People from ethnic minorities are up to 42 times more likely than white people to be the target of schedule 7.

Muslims are fairly targeted given the risk posed to this kingdom by Islamic groups.

The police would actually be failing at their job if they didn't take the most obvious common denominator into account, ie their race and religion.

When the police were focused on the IRA they didn't bother targeting Jamaicans or the French, because those groups don't tend to be part of the IRA. So for the same reason it wouldn't make sense to target people who are obviously not Muslim or ethnically linked to Islamic cultures when targeting Islamic terror cells.",0,1379283392,null,0,false,0,cc90dnm,t3_1mgbyn,t1_cc90dnm,t3_1mgbyn,null,1429452306,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Wanyama and Osvaldo are obviously good players but in order to incorporate them the likes of Schneiderlin and Lambert have had to change their game. Which means that the entire midfield and attack have had to change their game, which goes some way to explaining how many of the attacking players suddenly seem like they're in foreign territory when they're near goal. 

As good as Wanyama is, is he worth moving Schneiderlin out of the position that he was in last year? I'm not sure, but time will tell on that one as Schneiderlin looked like both an attackng threat as well as a defensive failsafe today. *dat half-volley*

As for Osvaldo, cannot play alongside Lambert, I'm afraid. It just isn't working. You need to play either Lambert OR Osvaldo being supported by 3 attacking midfielders. What Osvaldo has done is make me think that he may be a better choice than Lambert for that spearhead position. But he needs to score a freaking goal first.

Islam isn't a race, yet people don't think of a middle class white family when you say ""Muslim family"". It doesn't undermine: ""Islam isn't a race"" but it would hopefully make people think that the issue is subtler &amp; more involved than simply being an issue with a religion. Nuance... no?

As for the psychological side of things, the way I see it is that you're either the champions and you create an aura of ""we're definitely going to win this"" which beats your opponents before you even get on the field (70s/80s Liverpool) or you're not. We're not. The way to recreate this is not to inflate expectations too early, but to manage them and stay as underdogs while we can.

I have this idea that Clarkson owns (or co-owns) the production company that makes Top Gear - he was responsible for pitching the current format of show when ratings fell and the BBC was planning on dropping it. 

Clarkson writes a weekly car review for The Sunday Times - for that alone, he must spend several hours each week driving the car in question, and that's before composing his thoughts and committing them to a word-processor. That's one column, of all the other stuff he writes and shows that he presents.

You can probably worry less about the ones just in his name. The worst that will happen there is a CCJ is decided against him in his absence, or he is petitioned to be made bankrupt. It would be then up to them to recover assets (such as a house).

It's the ones in both his and your mothers name which should be of concern. And anything they are using, which they own jointly. Such as a house or car. Although this is only a concern when it gets to the bankruptcy stage.

While you are contacting debt advice companies, ask your mother to log the times and dates of calls, along with where the call is taking place. As unless permission was given, creditors cannot contact you at work. Obviously a mobile number is different. Harassment is something you can take to the ombudsmen. 

Any creditors calling for debts solely in your Dads name should not contact your mother whatsoever. If its a shared phone number, consider changing it.

In the meantime, it is probably also prudent to start moving things such as bills etc into your mothers name. And to contact your Dads creditors (only the ones in his sole name) to let them know the situation and request they stop harassing your mother.  

The likely outcome from all of this is your mother agrees a repayment plan with the creditors. It will be unlikely she can escape the debts in her name (unless she can somehow prove they were made without her consent). Creditors would much rather have something than nothing, which is almost what they'd get if she were to go bankrupt. A very high priority will be getting the creditors to freeze the interest. So she at least has a chance of paying it off one day.

Alberto will need time to adjust to the speed and strength of the English game, but we already knew that when we signed him. His level of experience and style of play differs from the likes of Coutinho -- a more direct player who had broken into the Inter first team as a somewhat established yet overlooked player by the time we signed him. It'll be interesting to see what Alberto can contribute to the squad this season, and his style of play is perhaps a indicator of how Rodgers sees this team playing in the longer term, but for now we should remember that he's only played B team football until this year and we'll need to be patient.

I don't know what industry you're in but most office stuff is universal. Just take a couple of weeks to get bedded in and ascertain who's who in the office:

* Outwith the chain of command there will be a social pecking order. Learn it and decide how you want to interact with it. 

* If there's a secretary or similar, be nice to them, especially if they deal with customer meetings or, to a lesser degree, office supplies. Don't go overboard, just don't be a dick. That last bit covers most stuff, really.

* Don't shag your coworkers if you plan on being there for any length of time. It's not worth the hassle. Their pals/flatmates/sisters are fair game, though.

* Adapt to the environment as you feel necessary but don't feel that you need to completely be one of the team. Being a wee bit aloof can work wonders if you're that way inclined. 

* Ultimately, try to think of it like starting uni all over again. It's as big a leap imo but the people are generally easier to deal with as you all have something in common. On a personal level (and a business one if you don't mind playing the long game) there really is no such thing as failure- there's only feedback. If you fuck up, only apologise as much as you absolutely have to. Learn from the mistake, don't let it happen again and move on. Never forget it, though. 

* Most of all, try to enjoy yourself! Again, I know it's hackneyed but I find that things are a lot better when you set yourself targets and try to hit them. Remember that every situation, good or bad, is a learning experience and the important thing is that you never stop learning.

It is also IN COMBINATION that you guys said ""loads"" of you guys will be away one weekend, which gave the impression that you guys are just not taking it serious enough especially when they finally decided you guys could be invited.

* Don't ever try to fake a British accent, it won't work and you'll look like a cock.
* Don't go around telling people ""yeah I'm American, but I'm not a douche"" or something like that. Be proud of being American, just don't be obnoxious about it.
* Finally, don't be offended when people give you shit for being American. British people love to make fun of each other (and themselves) quite a bit, but it's all in good fun, just part of the culture.

Especially with Daniel just receiving the Vice captaincy and his quality displays as well. I honestly rate Mamadou higher than Skrtel and see the sky as the ceiling for the guy.

Either way we for the first time in quite a bit, like BR said, are looking quite scary in the back. Sahko could be the signing that gets us Champions league this year, I mean look at the amount of goals we were scoring last season.

In book canon, Time Lords became incapable of reproducing sexually long ago and had to use Rassilon's Looms to procreate themselves, right?

This gives the government an insane amount of power over Gallifrey's population. 

Families can only create new members if they're in good enough standing with the government to be granted a Loom... and even then, they're only allowed as many family members as the government grants them. On top of that, the Looms track everyone they've ever created, providing a seriously intrusive amount of personal information to the government.

But Susan's bio-kid with David Campbell proves not only that Time Lords and humans are fully sexually compatible, but that at least some Time Lords aren't sterile at all.

At least, *when they're not on Gallifrey*...

What if the asexuality of the Time Lords is actually a government plot? By introducing birth control into the environment, they could convince everyone on Gallifrey that they needed the Looms.

In the original series, the closest any Doctor came to showing romantic interest in a companion was Three -- the one who'd been exiled from Gallifrey.

Then came the Time War and the end of Gallifrey... and suddenly, the Doctor's going through a slow puberty, with each regeneration from Nine to Eleven becoming more open to romantic or sexual relationships.

Maybe The Doctor's just finally off the Gallifreyan saltpeter?

Angie's Café off the High Street is pukka to go for your fry-ups and pie/mash but If you wanted something more like a chain then the Littern Tree bar/restaurant would be your best bet.

There are a few jogging groups and meet up's down the gym (Brentwood Center) that I know of if that's your thing. No real social meets though to my mind.

Best way to travel to London would be from the Brentwood rail station no questions about it, though dependant on where you're moving you may or may not want to catch a bus down there.

I've no problem with hair covering, black robes, any of that. But let me see the face. That's my right, surely?

Now admittedly we've no laws that require one to keep their face exposed. And when you visit Japan it is funny to see so many commuters wearing face masks (for hygiene reasons). But through the nature of tut-tuting and social conventions we've come to expect that we don't hide our identities as a matter of course.

That being said, where would he play if he hypothetically came to us? I guess on the left hand side, with Coutinho in the middle and Aspas/Suarez on the right and Sturridge up front.

true,strolls,null,null,"You'd probably be right to say there's no other realistic option, but I think it's worth recognising that property is inherently a state of saying ""this is mine, and you can't have it"".

If you work hard and save your money and buy a big house then that's great and I'm pleased for you, but I think we should acknowledge that the cost of rich people having big houses or country estates is that other people have to do without. 

Property rights are fundamentally not the same as the rights to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness and so on - those are all free, and don't cost anyone else anything. Property rights are a way of allocating the earth's natural resources and the fruits of them.

There's a lot more that I could write about this if the debate on Reddit wasn't so adversarial - it's always about sides and about who's right and the other guy's wrong. It would be awesome if more people could say, *""hey, I disagree with you but you have interesting ideas and I'll think about them""*. I might be as guilty as anyone else of doing the opposite.
 
So in the context of the bedroom tax, I don't think it is ok that poor people should have to sleep on the street so that someone who inherits an apartment building can live an idle life. I think that's a balance that's not ok.

I think that the cost of the state ruling over us all should be that it deprives no-one of a roof over their heads and that no-one goes hungry. Not even if they're totally scrounging loser wasters that are a nuisance to the rest of us. 

Finally, I'll add that in some other countries people accept high taxation as the cost of living in a fairer country. I think that as well as asking ""what is property and where does it come from?"" we could also all do with asking what will be the result of rising wealth inequality and falling social mobility.

These are measurable and provable metrics, and they seem to show that we're heading not only towards some people being richer than ever before, others poorer than ever, but also towards a state in which one's wealth is determined increasingly by the accident of one's birth, too.

We need to consider not only what politicians promise, and what we hope or what should happen according to our own theories of enterprise, but also what is actually happening when we look at the figures - do wastrel heirs really end up poor at the same rate at which those born on a council estate are able to better themselves.

true,Lillaena,cnty-uk,Essex Girl in Glasgow,"My personal feelings on the issue are pretty muddled. At first it seems clear-cut: forcing women to cover up and allowing men to wear what they like seems awful. It was quite a nice day last Saturday and a woman at the train station had a veil that covered her face and a huge, floor-length trench coat. She was pushing a huge buggy around too, which must have been quite hot work. It didn't look comfy.

But. I have read and heard of plenty of Muslim women who choose it, and will argue strongly for it. And is it really my place to tell them that they are *wrong*? Especially as an agnostic atheist who doesn't really ""get"" religion, so can't truly understand.

*But*. If their are indeed suffering from a form of indoctrination, then of course they're going to say they want to wear these veils...

I think having a debate on these things is incredibly important, but I'm not sure we'll ever reach a conclusion. In a way it feels like the debates on us going to war in other countries. Do we want to step in and enforce our values on other people? Can we objectively say that our morality is right? Obviously we cannot, but do we have a duty to help out when it seems like people are living in oppression? But there are plenty of people who *don't* feel like they're living in oppression. But have they just been indoctrinated?

It's really, really tough. My gut feeling is that the government should not be controlling what we can and cannot wear when we're out on the street. In court, in hospital, in certain roles - maybe.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Of course!  To address the last point first - it does really depend what subject you're planning to do, but as far as I know UCL is considered *overall* the better university.  KCL people might say otherwise though, there has always been a lighthearted rivalry there.  We prefer to take the QS world rankings as gospel ;)

I think you get a different student experience to your traditional 'campus' university, definitely.  Everyone doesn't live within 10 minutes of each other and you're a lot less likely to be able to roll out of bed a few minutes before your lectures, although some first year halls are still insanely close.  I think the atmosphere is much less of a 'bubble' and I think this can in a few cases lead to fears/feelings of isolation.  HOWEVER I do think it has massive perks - primarily that you're in one of the biggest and most dynamic cities in the world.  There is pretty much everything you could ever want to do at your fingertips and having a bunch of new friends to explore that with is awesome.  The UCL 'campus' and buildings are also pretty much all concentrated within about 3 streets of each other so you it doesn't feel too spread out.  We also have access to both UCLU (£1 drinks and the like) as well as ULU which is also super cheap and has club nights.  I've personally didn't feel isolated and found it really easy to make friends, in fresher's week there are still big club nights and everyone is in the same boat, it's just a more spread out experience I think than when everyone is all together in a student village and it's not necessarily for everybody.

Accommodation for 2nd and 3rd years, fend for yourself.  It's a hassle - estate agents are bastards and you pretty much have to look for houses less than a month before you want to move in.  Most people end up in the Camden area, we personally opted for slightly further out (25 min commute) and got a sweet deal in terms of having a big house for cheap.  It's really up to your personal preference/financial situation.  It can work out much cheaper than halls, particularly if you're willing to add 10 minutes to your journey time.  There are a lot of houses around, you just have to be on the ball.  Also you don't have the problem of having to decide who to live with by January which seems to be what happens a lot elsewhere.

Final point - it's expensive, but it doesn't have to be as horrible a everyone says.  Well, accommodation does.  Our halls are extortionate.  Everything else you can get by just fine if you're savvy about supermarket deals and student club nights.  But yes, halls are pricey.  Silver lining - if you need a job, you're probably more likely to get one in London than anywhere else (plus the SU pays london living wage!).

The law states a general purpose and then the courts decide if the action fits the purpose with other things taken into account.

USA law works on the system whereby everything is judged according to specific guidelines and exactly how things before have been treated.

For example, Section 5 of the public order act basically says you can't act in a way that causes harrasment, alarm or distress, or in a disorderly manner.  That doesn't in any way set out exactly what is what, that's up to a police officer to decide and later for the courts to decide if the action fit those descriptions in those situations.  The key point being that technically both someone cutting into a queue and the person tutting could arguably be called ""disorderly"" under its definition, but that's obviously not what happens.

The law is written generally in a way that sets out what's ok and what's not ok with a very broad definition - it's the general intent that matters.  So if someone was to be done for cutting into a queue under that law, it would be seen as taking the piss by the prosecution (obviously not real terminology ""taking the piss"" if that was your issue), and equally a law that allows business owners to reduce their tax payments in specific circumstances to help entrepeneurs that is used by someone wealthy with no business as a tax break is ""taking the piss"" as they're breaking the *intent* of the law even if it's not directly stated.

true,ZummerzetZider,null,null,"Ok well looking at the pictures is quite interesting, I think I will revise my theories a bit.

To break only the first one would require a kind of chop with braking. If you are familiar with croquet there are situations where you get extra shots that must be taken with your ball in contact with someone else's. However sometimes you want only your opponents ball to move and not yours. This is achieved by taking a hard shot that stops very quickly with no follow through. I suppose the same would work for the top brick.

For the middle bit the picture shows most of the force is directed at the top-left chock, going through it in a line going to the diagonally opposite corner of the whole affair. It also shows that his hand, and perhaps even some of his wrist are spreading the force out. This would mean that there is not too much force in any one place on the top brick so that it won't break, however the middle brick is stuck between the downward force being transferred from the top-left chock, and the upwards force from the middle left chock causing it to snap. In aid of this the top left chock is nearer the middle and the middle left is nearer the edge so that a snap in the middle is easier to achieve.

As for bottom brick, that seems a lot trickier, probably the hardest one to break. You might be able to do it just by trying to spread your weight very evenly over the top two and just relying on the misaligned chocks at the bottom causing the snapping, or maybe you have to try exerting force diagonally again but that seems a lot harder on the bottom one.",0,1379325239,null,0,false,0,cc9cenb,t3_1mdckb,t1_cc9cenb,t1_cc92g0m,null,1429446624,2,false,quiteinteresting,t5_2rfzr,2

The premeditated kind?  I think that making it the same punishment as murder is insane.  That just provides no incentive for someone to not murder the victim.

It also removes the possibility of rehabilitation of offenders.  I can't remember the stats, but when I did a child protection course (was working with and responsible for children overnight) we were told the majority of child rape was committed by offenders who themselves had been abused.  In the case of one incident that happened, it turned out that a 14 year old, abused a 13 year old outside of school time.  Are you saying that we should put in to prison a 14 year old teenager for life?  One that in many ways was attempting to come to terms with their own abuse?  These situations are not simple.

true,thelardboy,null,null,"Most people have covered off the big stuff, but a note on drinking:

If you have never had a drink before, do not try to match anyone else at your table.  Most locals will have been drinking illegally for a few years on and off and will have an idea of their capacities and limits.  You do not have this, so you are starting off at a disadvantage.  It will take a while for you to find out what you like, how much of it you can drink and how to deal with your hangovers.  My advice is to match every alcoholic drink with a soft drink.  Alternate a pint of regular (not export or strong) beer drunk slowly with a pint of water so you can gauge how that pint hit you.  It will probably make you a little giddy, more talkative and possibly a bit unsteady, but it's unlikely you'll notice that last one until you stand up.  The water will make sure you stay hydrated and also temper your drunkness.  It's easy to get drunker if you want to, but very difficult to sober up if you've gone too far.

Shots:  Don't do shots.  At least until you have an idea of how well you handle alcohol, shots are to be very much avoided.  They make you drunk much quicker than pints and cause horrific hangovers, especially if you mix.

Rounds:  People will start buying a round of drinks for everyone at the table, and the expectation is that if you accept a drink in a round that you will buy a round for everyone else at some point.  Don't worry too much about making sure you drink as many as you buy, this will all even itself out over time.  You don't have to be in the round if you don't want, you just have to tell people at the beginning that you'll stay out of the rounds and buy your own.  This makes controlling your drinking much easier as you won't be matching the rest of the group.  If you do enter the rounds, try to match the price of the drinks everyone else is having.  If everyone is drinking a £2 pint, asking for a £5 scotch will make you unpopular.  This is a prime example of when it's OK to stay out of rounds.  Don't be afraid to sit out a round if you're not feeling so good; you'll usually regret that one extra drink in the morning.  If you want to leave a round, you can only do so after you have made a trip to the bar yourself.  You can take this opportunity to get yourself a soft drink.

Accepting drinks: If someone offers to buy you a drink, make every effort you can to buy one back.  If it's a quick lunchtime pint, then the next time you're with them, ask if you can get them one.  No one likes a penny pincher.

Don't talk about how much you've had to drink.  There's nothing more boring than someone slurring ""Oh god, I'm so drunk, I've had 4 pints of Stella, 2 fosters, a guinness, 3 gin and tonics, 2 sambucas and a red cocktail.  I can't remember what was in it, but it tasted kind of fruity, but not like strawberries, it was something more sharp than that, and I think it had some oranges in there and then there was this ice, but it wasn't normal ice, I think they crushed it between granite and...""

Well done mate.  Your mother must be so proud.

&gt;but I think we should acknowledge that the cost of rich people having big houses or country estates is that other people have to do without

Only in the sense that if you are someone who works hard and acquires wealth, that then means other people become poorer.  Which is absolute bullshit of course.

&gt;I think that the cost of the state ruling over us all should be that it deprives no-one of a roof over their heads 

Wait what?  That's not a cost followed by a benefit.  That's two costs.  You got that all wrong, for there to be wealth to give then wealth has to be taken from the earners/makers.  This is immoral and unethical.  

&gt;Finally, I'll add that in some other countries people accept high taxation as the cost of living in a fairer country. I think that as well as asking ""what is property and where does it come from?"" we could also all do with asking what will be the result of rising wealth inequality and falling social mobility.

Not necessarily.  It's the status quo but that doesn't mean everyone accepts it.  51% of the people could be totally for it, and then remaining 49% dead against it.  Should the will of the 51% be forced up the 49?  No, of course not.

Relative poverty or actual poverty?  Because I only care about the latter.  The former is based in jealousy, which is pathetic.

It's perhaps tangential to the point you're making, but a life sentence really is for life.  They might let you out of prison on parole after 14 years, but you're still serving the sentence until the day you die.  You can be recalled to prison at any time if you put a foot out of line.

I only mention it because I was unaware of that fact until recently when someone else explained it here on Reddit.  It doesn't change the point you're making (which I agree with), but you're not really comparing like for like.

Lovren looks great so far. He has bought much needed quality to the back line.

Its early days for Oswaldo - I like the way he harried the West Ham defence yesterday. Once he is settled he looks like he will be very good.

Wanyama has had a mixed start. He looks like  a good ""destroyer"" type in midfield - but he looks shaky when he has the ball at his feet. His touch and his distribution can be quite poor at times. 
He is also keeping out a very good player in Jack Cork - Lovren and Osvaldo look better than the players they have replaced in our team, but I am not convinced that Wanyama is bringing more to the team than Jack Cork did last season.

I'm not saying they shouldn't be punished, fined, forced to pay back money etc, but I fail to see how prison will help society or them. The deterrent response is moot because people that commit crimes rarely think they're going to get caught - (or its an act of desperation in which case, maybe they needed benefits or at least help from the state). 

Prison is hugely expensive and doesn't really work in many cases. Don't get me wrong,  there are dangerous violent people that need to be locked up but benefit cheats are hardly in this group and the reason why they steal is either out of desperation or due to greed.  Counselling and education can be used here to much greater effect, as well as watching their spending. 

It is a complete waste of time and even more tax payers money to lock them up in the first place, locking them up for longer won't do a damn thing; its not like 5 years in prison is half the deterrent of 10!

true,CrashingAnalyst,eng-gloucestershire,Cheltenham,"It's the utility value theory - if you have £0 in your bank, £10 is more valuable to you than to someone who has £10,000 in your bank.

This means that you create 'value' through redistributive effects, one of which is progressive taxation e.g. tax free or low tax rates for low incomes.

A rich person spends more than a single poor person, but £1m spread over 500 poor people (approximate tax free amount for people earning £10k) is spent more and creates more value than £1m spread over 50 rich people.

Essentially poorer people spend a much higher proportion of their income (contributing to aggregate demand and stimulating the economy), whereas wealthier people withdraw their income from the economy (savings, overseas spending).

Obviously though there is a cost to redistribution - administering this via tax means you have to pay a taxman, etc. etc. which means that the increased value created in the economy from redistribution needs to be equal to or exceed the cost of redistribution. In general most benefits do meet this criteria and we are on the slightly more tax free side of the coin (hence why so many millionaires are happy to live here!).

Though I would argue that raising the poorest out of tax is a trap - they 'pay' for this by cutting things like the NHS, state education/schooling and welfare which primarily benefit the poor.

I'm a Canadian living in Ireland, so some of the same things will apply:

* any sugary cereal you like. A box of Froot Loops is almost $15 here!! And it's not even family sized
* coffee creamer. In Ireland, and probably in the UK, they mostly only have coffee whitener, which doesn't mask the taste enough. (But mostly, try to get used to drinking tea... not that coffee is hard to find, but tea is just a way of life here.)
* peanut butter. DON'T listen to any British person about this. Their peanut butter is absolutely inferior and they will never understand.
* more adaptors than you think you need
* fabric sheets, for the dryer. They are a bit difficult to find even in central London. And they are just lovely.
* a sense of humour-- people will be making fun of you, probably a lot, for being American. For the most part, no offence is meant, and a self-deprecating manner goes a long way.
* ranch dressing!! Fuck, I can't find it ANYWHERE here.

Obviously, none of this is essential (except adaptors). This is because you really shouldn't worry! You're going to have a great time, just relax a bit. Loneliness and anxiety are very natural. Be patient, adjusting to living in a new culture takes time. Most of your concerns seem to come from a place of of worrying about cultural missteps-- try not to be brash about topics that are generally controversial (immigration is one; also, if you are in Scotland, NI, or Wales, don't call people British, call them Scottish, Irish, or Welsh) until you have a better handle on things, so that you don't accidentally offend. Otherwise, people are extremely welcoming. Just have fun!

Edinburgh is always incredibly busy around Christmas/New Years. Right in the city centre, you have Princes Street Gardens and half of this is taken over by amusements, a ferris wheel, ice rink and a very large german market which serves beers, mulled wines, a wide assortment of cooked pork products :) It sounds so cliched but it adds to the ""magic"" of the city at this time of year. The city is decorated with loads of Xmas themed lights and generally looks great wherever you are.

For New Year's Eve, or Hogmanay as it's called here, there is a massive street party as others have mentioned. It's good to experience at least once but I wouldn't say it is an absolute must. You're crammed into Princes Street with 100,000+ people and as soon as the clocks chime, police start moving everyone very quick. Over the years, friends and I have been to clubs for special events but generally, being anywhere within the centre you'll find every pub packed and everyone having a good time.

Edinburgh is a pretty safe place even during both the Festival and Christmas time. You wont have many troubles travelling alone and I'm sure there will be redditors here willing to meet up.

Only real piece of advice I have for you is, just like the festival in August, Edinburgh is a popular place albeit a bit less busy. Hotels will get booked up fairly quick, so if you plan to stay in the city especially over 30th/31st, get your shit booked early.

Infact I'd distance it from your own brand as much as possible and think about getting a separate domain for it. The reason is although your brand might be all into swearing and crass humour, which is fine you can do whatever the hell you want. Forcing that into a community style setting just won't work. Reddit is a good example of of a community sourced website that doesn't force its own identity at all onto users. Sure there is /r/wtf and subreddits that let users do whatever they want but its entirely down to the users choice what they are exposed to.

Also just in terms of overall branding, doing it under your own username rather than a generic name could cause people to put off just because its pushing your personal brand down their throats. Would be like if Jeremy clarkson made a website to compile peoples car review videos. A lot of people would immediately not want to use that website because of his identity attached to it. I'm not trying to say your identity would push anyone away, but being neutral really is the best way to go in my opinion.

It's a good idea too, you could branch out into gear reviews and even reviews of ebay traders which are trustworthy. You could definitely turn it into a profitable website with enough time and effort invested as searching for a good bike review i've found via youtube is very hit and miss.

Paulinho - settled in nicely, has played a lot. Perhaps needs more time to gel, as his pass and move can be a little slow at times, but he looked best against swansea, when he was getting shots off, pushing us up the field. Problem is he clashes positionally with Dembele, who likes to dribble from deeper, like Pauly.

Chadli - looks to be a decent squad player. Not done anything special yet, but it's a big step from the Eredivise to the PL.

Erikssen - Last game speaks for itself. It'll be interesting to see if he can keep that form. Looked very lively and linked with the whole team delightfully.

Capoue - Amazing. He and Sandro are the best DMs in the league in that tackle/holding/kill role... he's a monster and still has more interceptions than half the team in the league despite being injured.

Lamela - not played yet really, but looks to be comfortable on the ball and I'm really excited to see how he develops.

Soldado - Scored 4 goals in 5 games... which is decent. 2 are pens, though. We need to get the ball to him more. That back heel attempt last game shows how intelligent he can be.

Chiriches - Not played.

--------

Rose - Looked really great last game, can become really super. Looks to be getting a lot of game time this season. Hope he can keep his form from last game.

Townsend - Really, really, excited by this player. He looks to be confident, is shooting a lot, takes people on, is quick. The only real criticism is that he needs to pass instead of shooting sometimes, but that's something that comes with time and experience.

How the fuck is someone who can't afford £14/week supposed to have the money to move into a private property?

Just in my shitty little town - average monthly rent for a 1 bed flat £377.

1 month deposit + 1 month advance =  £754.  Now add on another £300 or so for removals &amp; misc expenses.

Thats over £1000 cash needed just to move from one flat to another in a shitty low rent town.  

Change that to somewhere more expensive like Edmonton in London (a shitty area I used to live in London.  and you are talking around £2000 cash needed to move.

If it is someone with a 3 bedroom house needing to move to 2 bedroom, the costs are even higher.

A cult is a religious group with extreme beliefs and practices - beliefs that are often contrary to science and logic but they are believed as ""obvious"" truth by the cult members. 
The members of cults often isolate themselves from friends, family and society and use deceptive and unethical recruiting techniques
Use manipulative methods to control the minds of followers
Venerate a human leader or leaders
Recruiting work is performed by all of the members
People are not allowed to criticize the leader, the doctrine, or the organization, or read information that is critical of the cult.
Members are trained to reject and disbelieve criticism of the cult as lies from Satan.
Members spy on one another and report improper activities or comments to leaders.
Members are taught to suppress anything which might reflect negatively to outsiders about the cult.
The doctrine is absolutist and the ideology is internalized as ""the Truth.""
Members are told to avoid contact with ex-members or critics, even their relatives.
Members are instilled with a deep fear about ever leaving the organization, and anyone who does depart is of the devil and sometimes severely punished.
Members are emotional controlled and warned of being caught and punished.
Disciplinary action is administered by group leaders, which may involve excommunication for such things as questioning organization policy or doctrine.
People are encouraged to sacrifice education, career and family interests to server the interests of the cult.
Advocate socializing only with other members in the organization and avoiding outsiders.
The belief in apocalypse and Dooms Day

Islam fulfills each of this criteria in multiple ways. Do you honestly think that a group of people who dress the same, wipe their arse the same, eat the same foods, hang out exclusively in one social circle, worship one human leader as the ultimate human who ever lived (despite his paedophillia), and meet up once a year to throw rocks at a larger rock whilst chanting, aren't a cult because there are a large number of them?

I certainly don't dispute the fact that cannabis can fuck with your head, but the same can be said of alcohol and a plethora of other drugs, both legal and illegal.  

One of the problems of prohibition is a lack of quality control.  If you're buying drugs on the black market then you never really know what you're getting, how strong it is, whether or not it's been adulterated with anything, and so on.  It would be like walking into a pub and not knowing if you're buying a pint of bitter or a pint of Bacardi.  I happen to like bitter but Bacardi makes me puke.  Thanks to the legal framework we have regarding licensed premises, I can order a pint of bitter and enjoy it, safe in the knowledge that it almost certainly won't make me puke.  

Having such a legal framework for other drugs wouldn't stop people from getting ""drunk"" but it would at least allow those who choose to ""drink"" responsibly to do so.

I think it's more a case of ""don't do *anything* ever again"".  For example, your average person might get a caution and/or a fine if they get caught smoking a spliff, shoplifting, or some other minor offence.  Someone who's serving a life sentence could be recalled to prison immediately with no need for trial, etc (at least, I think that's how it works, but I'm not an expert).

So it's a bit more than just a warning.  And presumably the prison isn't obliged to release them early.  They can keep someone in for anything up to a full life sentence if they don't think they're eligible for parole, e.g. if they're a danger to society or likely to re-commit the same or other crimes.

When you love something to much, it can turn to hate. It's the modus operandi of most radicalisation.

So when western forces are bombing villages, they are bombing people who british citizens treat as their brothers and sisters.

Did you spend 3 years learning how to make a website, on a **non BCS accredited** course?  Yes?  You did PHP?  I'm not even going to read any further on your CV.  You're out.

Computer Science as a degree area has a many variety of sins, that's why we say when going to the source data, the employment spread of russel group unis being much tighter, than those which generally don't bother with accreditation.

There are also many more people who get 3rds and ungraded than the average.  People go to university, without being able to do Hello World or say implement FizzBuzz.  This means that a lot of the graddies that come out the other end are useless and require a lot of training.

The other problem is, if people are going to be developers, their training is expensive, very expensive.  There is a reason we won't be hiring any graduates this year, the difference in paying an extra say £20k a year is well worth it in terms of productivity.  A good experienced developer is often an order of magnitude more productive than an inexperienced developer.  This makes it rather expensive to train up a graduate.

The fact they spent all the time breaking down employment via race and gender, but ignored something as important as accreditation is shocking.

Lovren, fantastic. He also seems much more level-headed than I was expecting. Hopefully that's just a side of him that was more a factor of big responsibility at a young age; if he can play with tempered aggression, all the better.

Ossie will start putting in his chances. As well, you can tell that he's spent the last few years with players much more creative than our forward group and it's going to take some time for everyone to get on the same page.

Wanyama really seems to have thrown off our midfield. I thought he'd slot in better to be honest and I'm a little surprised.

&gt;  (Fascism is) Anti-individualistic, the Fascist conception of life stresses the importance of the State and accepts the individual only in so far as his interests coincide with those of the State.

http://www.worldfuturefund.org/wffmaster/Reading/Germany/mussolini.htm

There is no greater statement of individualism than defining how you live your life.

true,hotcod,null,null,"The thing is that there is an oddly strong argument that some women who choose to cover their face use. That by covering their faces and bodies they are actually liberated from the constraints that being judged by your physical looks can impose. We live in a culture that is, I think most people would agree, unhealthy obsessed with body image and I can honestly understand and see the attraction of choosing to remove my self from it. 

Of course in this case there is the issue that it's only a thing women seem to do and even if they choose to do it it also comes with it's own set of judgments (as evidence in this thread) but I think we do the women involved a disservice by simply assuming that this is something that they can't choose or can't find value in. I think it's also hugely dangerous to simply assume that face covering can't or doesn't have a place in a liberal society. Things are rarely so black and white. 

Now don't get me wrong I think he prevalence of the vale is directly due to being a cultural effect of sexisim in given countries, which is often been the result of those in power choosing to use religion to create that sexism as a tool of control. I mean by stating that women can't be educated, as an example, you have a population that is suddenly less educated by *half* and those who seek to hold on to power by enforcing outmoded and often extremely distorted religious beliefs the less educated those they want to rule over are the less they will be questioned.  

Anyway I'm getting side tracked. The upshot is that as far as I know in most forms of liberal Islam covering is a tradition not a law and women can choose to do it. Of course as you say ""choose"" is often a tricky thought in this circumstance but if we ban them in public places we *are with out question* telling them what to ware.

Its also something we have consistently seen with Defoe.

Townsend has the ability, and he has shown some flashes of it.  Certainly he still has potential.  He could work it out of his system; maybe he needs to realize he isn't playing with QPR anymore and his teammates are more skilled.  Regardless, he has been taking stupid shots instead of passing, and that is a Defoe-like trait.  It is a much worse habit for a winger than a striker.

Individuals who are looked up to by tons of people making a statement like that - well of course that's much more impactful than a meaningless facebook like. It's really a world apart. Every little bit of someone influential speaking out, or thought provoking stunt like this contributes to changing attitudes and changing what is socially acceptable or not - and that's especially important within a culture like sport which is maybe not the most open about these kinds of things at the moment, so it reaches more people who are maybe not already exposed to messages like this, and it's quite a good idea in that respect.

true,Eddie_Hitler,cnty-uk,Scotsman in East Anglia,"&gt; CS education is great but you also need to learn to program if you are going into the industry. Most CS courses won't do this.

Whoa.  Most ""Computer Science"" degrees I know of, even top 10 UK universities and internationally recognised courses, are so loaded with programming that it's usually the only tangible practical skill the students graduate with.

You can teach database theory until the cows come home, but they never let the students dabble with Oracle in their lab sessions.  You can teach networking until the fat lady sings, but don't think to let your students near enterprise-grade Cisco kit.

It's a farce.

&gt; Can we stop this lie that the Russell Group is elite?

Yes, we really should.

Russell Group is all about research and back-scratching between senior academics.  Just because a university is ""Russell Group"" does **not** imply that any of this will be passed down to the students and the teaching quality will be from the top drawer.

Sometimes it's the exact opposite because academics see teaching their field's answer to ""the cat sat on the mat"" to a bunch of hungover, disinterested layabouts as a total chore, and quite rightly so.
