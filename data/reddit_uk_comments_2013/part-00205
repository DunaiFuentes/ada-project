true,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"The way the British system works, UKIP wouldn't get any MPs, but would instead ensure that only Labour MPs got it. 

It's because each constituency hands out MPs by which ever candidate got the most votes. So if 51% of the constituency likes right wing parties and 49% likes left wing *and* there was only one right wing party and one left wing party than obviously the right wing party would win because 51% of the constituency's population voted for them. However, if there are two right wing parties and only one left wing party than the 51% percent of the population who would vote right will split themselves between the different parties meaning you get 25.5% voted for each of the two right wing parties (plural) and 49% voted for the left wing party (singular). This means that the left wing would get to send in an MP despite only gaining 49 percent of the vote and whislt 51% of the population did not want it. This is why small parties do so poorly in the UK. The Liberal Democrats suffer hugely from this because whilst they have huge popularity nation wide (at least prior to 2010) it's not often concentrated enough in each constituency and they only end up with a very small number of MPs compared to the number of votes they get. 

So what would happen if UKIP gained hugely in the polls is that instead of UKIP getting a lot of MPs or the Tories getting half as many MPs, both parties would just disappear and allow Labour the Lib Dems to take over Parliament.

Your children attend a school in your local area.  There are usually several primary schools (age 4/5 until 10/11) and one or two high schools (age 10/11 - 16/18) within your catchment area.  Some regions in England/Wales have junior(middle) schools too.  In the usual admissions procedure you would pick your top three schools in order and then the council reply to you saying which one there is space for your child (depending on factors such as distance from the school, whether there are already existing siblings attending school, etc).  You can read more about that [here](https://www.gov.uk/schools-admissions/choosing-schools).
If you have a rough idea where you want to live, you can look up the [OFSTED reports](http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report) of local schools

Public / Independent schools are private schools, each with their own set admissions costs and criteria.  This isn't something I've looked into, at least in Scotland it's not really a big thing for the younger years... most people who go to private high schools generally spend primary school in state school.

Primary school generally runs from 9am - 3pm (with a little leeway - my daughter's school starts at 8:55!).  For high school add another 40 - 45 mins to the end of the day.

Class sizes are a maximum of 30 pupils / [25 in Scotland for years 1-3](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Education/Schools/Teaching/classes).",0,1380587560,null,0,false,0,ccijhzo,t3_1nh2zy,t1_ccijhzo,t3_1nh2zy,null,1429288321,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

To the point about Rogers not wanting to substitute, I believe that there weren't really any changes that could have been made that would have strengthened the side against Sunderland or at least give the side an advantage in some other area. When Rogers decided to take off Moses, I was pretty upset as I thought he was playing very well in the hole. I'm generally in the camp that you need to be using all 3 of your substitutions, but felt that Liverpool had been doing a good job of bending but not breaking by absorbing pressure and that any substitution would change the chemistry of the side for the worse.

Maybe it's a case of not enough quality (for lack of options because of injuries perhaps)? Because if you had the quality, there's no reason you wouldn't put on some fresh legs. Just my 2 cents.

And you - who, lets nots forget, **wasn't** there, **didn't** see it, **didn't** follow us and is only trying to piece things together by selective reading of selective sources (even though you have already demonstrated that reading is not one of your best skills) - you actually know better.

Right on.

THe genius ""arguments"" you have provided thus far, along with the brilliantly incisive conclusions you tacked onto them (Collymore &gt; 100m, for example), have been adequately summarised in my previous post. Anyone else in need of comedic relief can find what they need, right there.

&gt; I think that means I win by default.

Yes, you win. Well done. Now go along and play in the corner. And please stop dooling, thanks very much. And don't forget, **you're a winner**. Well done.

And you're right.

Fuck EE in the ear.

£21 a month for a 12 month SIM only contract with 500MB of data allowance (and admittedly unlimited calls/texts), really?

When for example [Three](http://store.three.co.uk/view/searchSimOnly?tariff=3034&amp;intid=3storephrbn1118) would do you 2000 minutes (and another 5000 Three-to-Three minutes if you really need that), 5000 texts, and all the data you need for £15?

Or [Vodafone](http://www.vodafone.co.uk/shop/pay-monthly/sim-only-plans/index.htm) could do you 900 minutes, unlimited texts, 500MB data, for £13? - or if you really did need something similar to EE, you could have unlimited calls, unlimited texts, and a gig of data, for £21.

So, yeah.  Well worth jumping ship.

I'd personally recommend having a look at Rootmedia's site to get an idea of what the coverage is like where you live, just to make sure you're not picking a network that happens to have particularly crappy coverage where you live.

Our attack and defense is boss. I'd say we need cover of some kind in central mid and up front. Lucas is a bedrock and Gerrard is Gerrard, but this is where we are weakest. We have the best two front players in the league (fuck Rooney/RVP), but if either (or God forbid both) of them are out, then what? Who else is scoring goals?

If we're 3-5-2/3-4-1-2, I'd like to also get some long-term left-side player to ease in, because Moses is only on loan. If we're 4-3-3 then we're not so bad across the pitch, but still lack depth.

I personally think we're a distance behind Man City, Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham in the middle, but we have a better keeper than everyone (in my mind) and a better defense than most and a better first-team front-line than anyone.

But that is really the point, this person is heir apparent to the Irish baronetcy of Ballentaylor and Ballylemon. This line was established almost 400 years ago and has been heavy involved within politics over that period, this is a family (like the prime minister’s) that has shaped the country we live within by giving themselves advantages that are simply not available to the vast majority of the country. 

Do not forget that we are talking about people that owe everything to the patronage of an individual that was considered to have a divine right to rule, that is they were appointed by god. 

How does that fit in with the concept of a democracy? It simply doesn’t.  This inequality means that you may be a hardworking, gifted wonderful person that works day and night to build a better life for your own children but will be prevented of achieving that due to having to work within a system that is simply fixed. 

The principle difference between organised crime families and the upper class is the upper class get to write the rules.  

So I agree that people should have the opportunities to improve themselves and their children’s lives but how far do we allow this to go as a society? If that advantage means that everyone else is placed at a disadvantage then surly we are living within a plutocracy not a democracy.

does the individual not carry some responsibility for that choice?

Another thing you seem to be ignoring is the bit about those friends ""taking dodgy pills off scummy dealers at festivals etc"" - which, even within a context of illegality, is definitely more risk than you need to take on. Buy your pills from a dealer you know, whom friends are also buying from, without having had any bad deals -- that's a lot safer than buying off some random punter at a festival who can sneak away into anonymity again. 

So that's a choice too: whether you're willing to make your plans in advance and if you run out, you run out; or not wanting to bother making prior arrangements / not wanting to leave it at the x pills you brought instead of buying a couple extra.

This is the nerve I have hit with you - you can't stand that you see yourself as such as big fan and don't realize you are wearing rose-tinted glasses of the stereotype old 'super fan' who talks shit.

We have all met at least one of them, the question is how you guys manage to leave the bar and find us here on reddit? The reason why I like this sub is because there aren't people here like you, we have real discussions here, not talking about who is more right because they are older.

I'll give you a tip, if you want to be the smartest guy in the room again, you are going to have to leave this room and go back to the bar stool at your local where you can tell everybody your brilliant stories from the 70s and 80s and pretend that you know everything there is to know - because here on the internet, where we have access to facts and reliable sources, that doesn't work.",0,1380605974,null,0,false,0,ccipjnk,t3_1l4837,t1_ccipjnk,t1_ccijzsf,null,1429285500,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,Death_Star_,null,null,"You see, you're making a ton of assumptions, most of which are unpleasant and make me sound mean.  That's EXACTLY why I said, ""please don't take offense"" -- to completely dispel any possibility of someone thinking I'm out to offend.

And the person didn't take offense.  You seem to take the most offense.  It's very simple.  Celebrities probably have a higher tendency to retweet efforts from children than those from adults.  The watercolor painting, to the average PERSON, arguably looks like a child's effort -- and that's the nature of watercolor, perhaps.  But, it could also simply be a child's painting.  

I asked how old the person was because I wondered if he or she were a child.  It doesn't really mean that I'm trying to be mean.  If someone had the handwriting of a child, I'd ask the same thing.  And how would you go about asking how old that person was (the person with the child-like hand-writing)?  Does it make me a ""not nice"" person by asking the question?  If I were trying to be mean, I would've said, ""What are you, 12?  That painting looks childish!""  Instead, I gently asked the person's age, and even honestly admitted my motive behind the question.  And to be honest, I think I've seen watercolor paintings that are more ""sophisticated"" and don't make me question the painter's age.  It's just that the one in question had a combination of factors that made me question whether it was an adolescent who painted it, from the font to the detail to the coloring.  And maybe Moffat thought the same thing, maybe he didn't -- but my guess is that he'd sooner put up a child's painting than an adult's.

Maybe it makes me ""not nice.""  But that's why I prefaced it with ""I hope this doesn't come off wrong,"" and I reiterated that it was an innocent, well-meaning question.  I could not be clearer that I wasn't trying to offend.  

But there will always be sensitive people (perhaps, like yourself) who will always be offended, even if the intent is genuinely innocuous.  And shouldn't the intent be the most important thing here?  I'd be more offended if someone tried to be mean to me, but said something that was on-the-surface nice, than if someone said something that could be misconstrued-as-mean, but the intent was genuine, innocent, and ""nice.""

The #1 goal was NOT to ascertain the age; it was to make sure that the painter was not offended.  She said she wasn't.  And I'm glad.  She understood my genuine intent to avoid anonymously hurting her and accepted it.  I'm not sure why I need a lecture from you on etiquette -- seems that I did everything I could to not offend her, other than completely censoring myself, which is what you seem to recommend (""don't ask the question,"" and ""I wouldn't have bothered [asking]"").  If someone is really that offended by ""Please don't take offense, but how old are you? I say this is the nicest way, because..."" then that person is just too sensitive.",0,1380606163,null,0,1380606765,0,cciplb6,t3_1nbiug,t1_cciplb6,t1_ccijpka,null,1429285478,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

I had around -15 on every comment I made. Now he has 1 good game and you're crying for him to come back (some of you)?

I thought Barca had made the buy of the decade when they got him in 2011 after watching his time at PSV, but its never really worked for him there, but neither have other, hugely talented players.
Hes 27 so by no means over the hill and can play up front, on the right or could be an excellent backup for Coutinho in the middle. Or even challenge his place in the team. 

Also i think someone like Michael Essien would be a shrewd bit of business. Hugely expericed, i can't see him getting alot of time at Chelsea and wouldn't cost much because of his age. Not in his prime sure, but someone who knows where to stand and not fuck up. 

I don't think for a second that Jan isn't a good time to invest in youth (sites Coutinho and Sturridge). But as i have said before in this sub, if we are involved in the top 4 in Jan, especially the way things are looking now (City and Utd not looking the full quid yet, Spurs still trying to decide what their best team is and Chelsea not really finding their groove) we will have a real chance of finishing in that top 4 at least.

Long term I really think Rodgers should attempt to coach Hendo into the Lucas role. I know its a rare thing in football to switch a players position (its absolutely not rare in American sports), but Hendo's strengths and weaknesses already make him seem quite a good fit. If he had some better awareness in the position and improved his tackling, I think he'd be in with a shout.

Some might say that's the whole position but I have to feel like both are coachable. He certainly has the will and I think when you consider some point soon he won't be able to own a position in the first 11 he'd jump at the chance to find one versus dropping off to a team likely below us.

I don't have much of a position on this; I don't like the idea of tax avoidance (rather than evasion) on moral grounds, but I understand that that's the nature of business.  Google at least do 'give back to the community' both with their free web services and things like [donating 15,000 Raspberry Pi's to schools](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/3158) which is probably tax deducatable. But I'd rather see 15,000 kids see that IT is more just using MS Office than Google pay a couple more million in taxes.

It it is the very essence of survival and a community that cultivates a sense of mutual responsibility will be more likely to do OK as the economic and environmental crises unfold. 

You seemed to think that the benefits system represent support by society but it is nothing of the sort. Maybe you feel that you personally made a contribution to the lives of benefits claimants through the taxes you pay. But I contend that some sort of abstract currency transaction which you are compelled to participate in where some mathematical formula is played out in the form of your wages, taxes, expenses, bills, savings, pension, disposable income is immaterial to any real economic activity. 

If you feel that the figure that is deducted from your income by the government is in any way a reflection of your contribution to society, I have a bridge to sell you. 

As to the ""global capitalist conspiracy"", maybe you think you are clever using another term you don't understand but it is trite of you to dismiss valid ideas using such hoary old labels. I very much doubt there is a unified conspiracy. Infact, I couldn't imagine a group of powerful individuals working collaboratively to control the world in secret. 

However, there are quite obviously many conspiracies afoot. If you've ever interacted with human beings (presumably you have) you would take this for granted.

For example the current housing price bubble is an economic conspiracy being worked out in secret with the press helping to obscure the true nature of the government's plans. The destruction of the benefits system is a conspiracy to force down wages (yes, this is going to impact you sooner or later) and increase the power of the rich. The privatisation of the NHS is another, where the public has been mislead to believe they will be entitled to free medical services forever but very soon you will start getting bills.

It is true that there is an argument that giving money with someone with an addiction is just supporting their habit and I understand that. Counter arguments include: addicts will always get money from somewhere so if it keeps them stable enough not to mug someone or sell their arse on the street then that is a gain. If it keeps them in contact with services so that they can retain their DLA then that is also a gain. Just as important is that addicts (my dad was an alcoholic who died alone so I have some experience here) are still human beings, they are not ""them"", a special sub-category over there.

That's still not terrible, though, so I suspect the reasons are cultural: Americans don't drink much tea, and coffee is typically brewed using specialised electrical devices.

As a comparison, Japan has an even lower voltage domestic supply (100 V), but tea is very popular. Most people own a ""pot"", which is a kind of insulated electric hot water urn. A thermostat keeps the water hot, usually at 85 C or so; some allow you to boost it to 95 C or so if needed, but 85 C is a good temperature for brewing Japanese tea.

We have improved by 4 points till now over last year. We were short of 12 points from 4th, so I would say its a good start. 


In the last five seasons, seven of the 10 upper half teams have been the same. These are Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Man City, Man U and the spuds.

This means the 12 internal matches of these clubs normally has a big influence on the end table, the so called six point matches.

Arsenal, Everton, Liverpool and City have only played one of them so far, all located at home.

Chelsea have played 3, all of them away.
Manutd have played 3, two of them away.
The spuds have played 2, one of each.

The league position of Chelsea in particular is strong compared to the schedule they have faced so far.

Forrest was ultra-defensive last year against Alba, but seeing as he's out, we might have a bit of joy on the wing. Alves will be taught an absolutely masterclass by Izzy, goes without saying.

You'd think Baldé would be a more likely sub than Pukki, especially after that beautiful finish at the weekend. If we're getting most of our chances from crosses, Baldy is just too big and too strong to leave out.

They're not. In the local regional paper jobs section there's as many jobs advertised as there has always been. However what is different is they're no longer mostly unskilled labour/factory work which for Hull means many people who couldn't be arsed at school are excluded from them. And given how much unskilled work in Hull pays and how comparable benefits are for someone with kids there is no incentive for those with low/no qualifications to bother to go into further/higher education to improve themselves.

A legitimate reason to block publication of a very small amount of information that no major UK newssource wants to publish anyway (nuclear codes, names of secret agents etc.) that is used as an excuse to block publication of a much larger amount of information that has a legitimate public interest in being published (the government bypassing your assumed right to privacy under the guise of terrorism prevention). 

&gt;personal privacy, 

I agree that privacy is important, though there isn't actually much legal restriction in this area. There are restrictions on how they collect information, and rightly so but there is very little private information that newspapers can't publish assuming they obtained the information in a legal fashion. Which is as it should be. 

With regards to privacy I'm more worried about the government than the newspapers personally.

A couple of things spring to mind:

1. If there's a shortage of jobs *now*, what is the rationale for disincentivising fertility when those children will not enter the labour market for another 2 decades?
2. As has been metioned elsewhere in the thread, remember that future children will be supporting pensions- which I believe are the single largest ticket in terms of benefit payments, as well as the things you mention such as hospitals. 
3. What is the need to limit? In fact, our fertility is still below replacement level despite recent increases. Further, increases in the proportion childless means that if you limit family size, you will tend to drastically reduce fertility, since you are cutting off the high parity women who are compensating for the ever increasing number of [childless women](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/fertility-analysis/cohort-fertility--england-and-wales/2011/sty-1-in-5-women-are-childless-at-45.html)

When we were kids (I am 42) we were lucky to maybe get hold off a magazine or two, and that was off an older kid. Most kids never got that lucky. My first porn was a weathered page out of a razzle that I found in the woods, it had already been through a few hands, but to me it was like finding the holy grail. Other then that it was only my imagination as a tool. When we did get internet you waited 45 seconds for a jpeg to display in full. High speed domestic connections are a new thing (5 years?) and have changed the porn world completely and how we interact with it and how much of it there is one click away.

The difference now (and putting aside all moral aspects) is the immediate availability and (more importantly) vast variation of internet porn, and that it can cause quite a bit of  havoc on our brains rewards systems in a way never experienced before (constant release of dopamine and endorphins and a tolerance which forms). 

Some users will go on to suffer from with addiction problems, erectile dysfunction and depression from internet porn addiction. They will also have a bigger issues as they go through life. It typically goes on to damage their careers and relationships with others. 

We also still do not know the effect it might have a on  young minds which are still developing. Studies are coming out now that show a reason to be concerned. Again I don't say this from a religious or moral stand point, but we can't ignore a potential issue which might be harmful to our young, just because it often gets washed in with the moral debate. It's not about sex is good, sex is bad.

I think even the die-hard Sterling fans would have to agree that he doesn't look as good now as he did when he first burst onto the scene before Xmas last year, but I think many people attribute his ""decline"" (if we can call it that) to different factors.


As an 18 year old lad, who's suddenly been thrust into the spot-light, and handed a pot of cash, *and* had 2 court appearances this year ... it can't be easy to keep focused on your work.


Hell, I'm nearly 40 and if I have a mild falling-out with my missus at the weekend it's on my mind for days afterwards and affects my concentration and productivity big-time.


So for me, the difficulties *outside* of football, largely explain why he has fallen away somewhat the past 9 months or so. I think this is also backed up by the fact that Brendan keeps mentioning his need to ""focus"", get his head right, simplify his life, etc (sorry I don't have any sources or quotes, but he has said several things along these lines).


Now, as to why I (and I believe many others) rated him so highly in the first place - it was NOT because he was a speedy kid, it was NOT because he had decent balance and change of direction/pace, it was NOT because he showed some nice dribbling tekkers.

*It was because he seemed to have a decent football brain.*

He made good tactical decisions. He would go outside, then inside; short, then long; shoot; then pass - he mixed it up a lot, and most often the choice at any given time was the right one. I can't remember the exact cirsumstances, but when we had a bit of a breakway late in the game he *looked* to make a break for the box, but then instead took it to the corner and gained valuable minutes.

That's a football brain, it's very very hard to teach that to a wilful kid. Sterling has it, and *that* was what excited me.


When you add a football brain to an accomplished athlete, you have the *potential* for a top-drawer footballer. Of course he has to be lucky with injuries, of course he has to keep his nose clean and his head down. But, if he manages to do those things, I believe he has the ability to be a top-class footballer. Maybe even a true great.


Now, regarding your attitude ... I guess I had similar feelings that you have, but towards Jonjo. The difference is, IMO, that Jonjo is 3 years older, he has had more chances to develop and he showed *MORE* immaturity than Sterling. Way worse decision-making, and a poor disciplinary record. So I think, that with Sterling only being 18, and not being a first-teamer, we should support him and his development, rather than rubbishing him and making negative pronouncements on his future.


Anyways, let's have the bet, you might well be right - only time will tell.

If Sterling *does* behave off-the-field, and *doesn't* get any bad injuries, then I feel pretty sure that he will develop into a top-class player (tho maybe will take a bit longer than 3 years to hit his peak). Also, top-4 ... probably should be top-tier, because it's more of a top-6 top-7 now, right?

While you may claim that the Guardian's ultimate goal is to paint these people as out of touch via association with their wealth (as that is their goal) they don't actually *say* that.

To me there is a big difference from simply saying 

""The government is taking benefits away and reducing the welfare budget for the working classes, while leaving the 'corporate welfare' budget untouched or enlarged""

 or 

""David Cameron just gave a speech about austerity, and how it was important that we save and he's forgoing his wages this year, yet he and his family are already millionaires"" 

to

""David Cameron's parents are rich and hate poor people therefore David Cameron hates poor people"".

The Daily Mail is fully aware of the fact that even if somehow Ed Milliband makes them apologise and retract their statements, they will already be etched into the brains of their readership and a retraction will mean nothing. The readership of newspapers like the Sun and the Daily Mail have, as a rule of thumb, only a loose grasp or interest in political affairs, so it's all about hammering a message home until it's stuck. 

If that costs them £10,000 in legal fees and an apology later on, who cares?

Finally there is a big BIG difference between saying ""This person is rich you know"" and then letting people automatically assume therefore he is out of touch and saying ""This person hates poor people"" (the Mail did the equivalent of the latter).

The former is stating a fact (albeit with a purpose in mind) and the latter is creating ""facts"" where they don't exist.  

Regardless of all the above, even if yo don't agree with I've just written you've still compared two totally different scenarios. If the Guardian started publishing news stories about how rich Cameron's family was without any sort of context to put it against (ie.g. DC just said how he understands how hard it is for families right now, but how does he?)

Juxtaposing Ralph Miliband's role in the Royal Navy and the Daily Mail's support for Hitler is relevant for the discussion given that the Mail declared that Ralph Miliband's character is sufficient grounds to defame his son.

true,thepowerofscott,BnW,,"My story:

I'm a Dutch Canadian, 20 years old, who had little exposure to European football before the 2010 World Cup. That was when I really started to gain interest. Diego Forlan and Wesley Sneijder were two of the players that impressed me the most and so for a while I started to watch Atletico and Inter, their respective clubs. 

Growing up in Canada, there really wasn't a lot of soccer showing on TV so I looked for streams, text play-by-plays and highlights. The 2010 World Cup had also sparked a lot of interest in Canada and more Premier League games started to show on TV. Every one who thought they knew a bit about soccer supported Chelsea and Man U, simply because those were the clubs that got the major screen time. These people couldn't even tell you the 3 best players on either team and that really bothered me. I wasn't going to support a team like that, I was going to learn about and follow a team that I enjoyed.

So as more Premier League games started to show, I got some more exposure to different teams. I can remember seeing different highlights of a Man City game, unfortunately I don't remember which one it was. But I remember enjoying the way they played. David Silva, Aguero (who I knew from Atletico with Forlan) and Yaya Toure were all big name players who I had already heard of and loved to watch. Of course, Nigel De Jong was a Dutchman who I knew and loved as well, I was gutted when we sold him on.

Ever since then I've tried to watch as many games as I can online or on TV and have enjoyed every minute of being an MCFC fan, learning the history and all. I recently bought my first kit (Kompany #4) and wear it probably a little too much.

It is my absolute dream to attend a game live at the Etihad, but it's one that may never come to pass.

The main problem I think is that in the past the systems were created to get the best out of Gerrard. Under Benitez you had the Gerrard as an Attacking Midfielder behind Torres or tucked in on the right, allowing him to get forward and use his energy.

Under Dalglish and Rodgers, you usually had two defensive minded midfielders plus Gerrard. Where Gerrard was more often than not, asked to keep the ball simple and launch it for a counter attack when he had the chance.

This year. Brendan is playing Lucas + Gerrard in the defensive minded positions. While Gerrard has been his usual self, this system was made to accommodate Coutinho playing behind the striker(s).

So now you have Gerrard filling in a spot in the system that wasn't created with him in mind unlike previous years. And I think that's why we're noticing a drop in performance. 

Before the systems were created with Gerrard's strengths and weaknesses in mind. This year, Gerrard is filling an essential spot that's not tailor made for him. ",0,1380633699,null,0,false,0,ccitthp,t3_1nglir,t1_ccitthp,t1_cciroub,null,1429283433,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Kind of, but there are fantastic amounts of products you just can't get as cheap elsewhere unless you order from China on eBay and wait the month.

I recommend their cycle equipment like lights, cheap tool sets if you don't want to make that investment and will rarely use them, storage solutions like plastic boxes and lunch boxes. 

Also go for things like scissors, you can get a pack of 3.

As for tech my Poundland USB bluetooth dongle hasn't let me down so far. I also have a Poundland card reader and a Poundland metal tablet stand.

If you're into dried nuts, fruit or yoghurt coated fruit they have a whole range at £1 which usually costs £2-£3 in places like Holland &amp; Barrett.

I definitely stay away from general food and toiletries though for the reasons you outline, usually get them cheaper in the supermarkets or Superdrug.

Edit: Also cables, want a cable? First check in Poundland. You'll pay £15 for the same cable in Argos or Currys.

There are a number of factors that have affected house prices in the SE UK, and none of then have anything to do with ""immigrants"". We have:

* The massive ""Buy to let"" market in the UK

* Foreign investors purchasing London property without living in it as investment and avoiding taxation, also pushing a vast number of people further out of the SE. Links were provided as evidence in a post above. 

* The Government artificially propping up the housing bubble by keeping interest rates rock bottom, and offering to cover part of the deposit for new build buys.

* Lack of legal protection for tenants, no minimum living space, or any attempt at capping rental prices, making ""Buy to let"" viable for people who clearly should never be landlords. 

* The refusal to build on green belt land.

&gt;Four caffeine-induced disorders are recognized by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) including: caffeine intoxication, caffeine-induced sleep disorder, caffeine-induced anxiety disorder and caffeine-related disorder not otherwise specified (NOS)

This does not in any way support your conclusion that immigrants are causing a housing shortage. The [Shard](http://the-shard.com/shard/explore-the-shard/vertical-city/) only has 13 of its floors for use as apartments. They will be high-end apartments for the extremely wealthy, many of whom, again, will be investors, corporations, or non-UK owners.

&gt; If there are less people everything costs less and we get paid more.

Doesn't work like that, dude. 

&gt; I doubt much does make sense to you.

Well, this sentence on its own certainly doesn't make any sense to me. What are you talking about?

&gt; Interest rates are to stop inflation from ass fucking us into the ground.

The effect the current artificially low interest rate of 0.5% is to keep the cost of lending low. [Mortgage interest rates](http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/mortgageshome/article-1687576/What-mortgage-rates.html) are insanely low at only a couple of percentage points. This is keeping the housing market, and the buy-to-let market, propped up. Great for people who managed to jump onto the housing ladder a few years ago, but fucking awful for everyone else, all of whom need a massive correction in the housing market in order to be able to purchase a home of their own. 

The correction would already have happened had it not been for the government intervening. 

&gt; There is legal protection people don't use it. There are minimum living space requirements immigrants break the law no one reports them.

The legal protection is woefully inadequate, which you would know if you'd ever rented and had a bad landlord, as I have, and as I am sure many people here have. 

&gt; Why would people cap rent?

Oh, I don't know, so that people in essential services could actually afford living in the South East in reasonable accommodation. So that the parasitic relationship Buy-to-let mortgage owners have with the housing bubble becomes less attractive. Because its the right thing to do. 

&gt; You a looking at the wrong side of the issue.

No, honestly, I am not. The market is being propped up by the government. What is most galling is that, even as my deposit sits in the bank growing at a pathetically low rate of interest, I am also paying tax to help the government prop up a housing market that I can never enter.

Absolutely, to both of you.  
I didn't give a flying fuck about the Miliband brothers before this story, nor did I have any idea what Labour had been up to in the post-Brown era...

true,ibpants,1972crest,,"I was born in Manchester in a hospital 4 minutes from Maine Road.  I was born to a working class Protestant mother from East Manchester.  As City fan credentials go, I had a head start, but traditionally fans are fathered in - that is raised as a fan and taken to matches by their Dads.  To this day I don’t know who my biological father is.  My mum was a passing blue, but not what you’d call die-hard.  My step-dad (who now goes by ""dad""), is a long-time fan, but he gave me a late start, plus we were a family of poor northerners under Thatcherism, so match days were few and far between.  I'm told that my first match day was a dull draw against Luton and I wasn't terribly interested.

I find the specifics of my childhood difficult to remember, so bear with me.  Initially I knew that I was supposed to be supporting Manchester City, and I knew that they wore blue, but that was the long and short of it for my earliest years.  I think I confused them with Everton at one point, and accidentally cheered them on while watching an FA Cup match on TV.  In school my friends were City fans, although I remember some amount of jostling with some of them.  I have a half memory of going to school one day and my friends telling me they now supported United, and asking me if I supported them too.  Peer-pressure being what it is, I think I probably went along with it for a couple of days before confessing that I still supported City (and peer-pressure being what it is, most of them switched back to City too).

It was a vague sort of tribalism that made up the culture I grew up in and didn't require too much of an active kind of support - especially at that age, and I was happy to engage with it in a minimal way, until I saw them thrash Huddersfield 10-1 (at which point David White became my hero).  That day turned me in to a more active fan, but even then it was tough going.  In my neck of the woods United fans were pretty rare, but there were enough about to remind us that it was *only* Huddersfield.  Then we beat United 5-1 in 1989, and that was the day that I realised I would always be a City fan.

I've posted similar sentiments here before and found myself well into the negatives, but what the hell. I think it's worth restating.

They were hardly alone in their tacit support for Hitler's Reich in the early thirties. I'm reading a book about the regime at the moment called The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, written shortly after the second world war by an American journalist living in Berlin during Hitler's rise. The Nazi regime received pretty glowing coverage in a number of British papers, *most prominent of which* was the Mail. Also, The Times gave occasional support, for instance in the debate over rearmament after WWI.

And that's just the common press. There was plenty of writing going on in favour of the little man's ideas elsewhere outside of newspaper offices.

The Daily Mail is shit. Nobody is denying that. I just think it's lazy to give them flack for an editorial decision made decades before most of their present staff were even born, especially when most of the people making the criticism aren't aware of what was actually said, or don't fully understand the historical context for such a piece.

There is a long laundry list of reasons to despise the modern publication we're all so familiar with. Instead, give them shit for keeping Littlejohn around, keeping Dacre as Editor, their shameful website (which is 99.99% clickbait), the continued employment of Liz Jones and Sam Brick, their hypocrisy over the sexualisation of young women, and so interminably on.

We may not play the best football in the world, but at least we're more stable and with a better team atmosphere than we have been in a good few years. One thing that bugs me big time though, is his insistence on playing people out of position. He's done it shitloads.


Vaz Te - He's a forward, a striker. Yet for most of his West Ham career he is stuck out on the wing. That's not his natural or favoured position, he won't be as effective there as he could be in his preferred position.

Maiga - Same again, a forward not a winger. Yet before Carroll got injured, the vast majority of the time Maiga got a pop was from the right wing. He had a record of nearly 0.5 goals per game before he came to us. He has talent. But playing him on the wing, then up front in a system that doesn't suit was never going to work.

Collison - He's not a winger, simple as that. He prefers to be central. Yes, he has played on the wing and has played fairly well there at times, but we can't expect him to bring the pundits in crediting him with game changing performances if he isn't playing where he wants to.


Collison won't normally be a starter for us, not with the central options we have and the state of his knees. I can't imagine he'd be able to play a full 90 for every game in a season even if he wanted to because of that. The lads a Wales international. He's a good player, he's only 24, he's not past it yet. He will therefore make a good sub for us, a good back up.

Even my cousin has said to me before about how shit Taylor is. ""Who's number 14, he's shit."" She doesn't even like football.

An examinor I had was telling me the story of how he was congratulated as he damaged millions of pounds worth of US Navy plane.  He lost aileron control and landed entirely with elevator and rudder, on a carrier, at sea, during the American War in Vietnam.

Any landing you walk away from is a good one, one where the plane can be used again is a great one.

We've had better performance than many of our peers.  It's not a great landing, but it's certainly good.

Would things have worked out differently if Labour had stayed in power?  No one can say for sure.  But we do know those who were lending the money considered Brown and Co a liability, hence the drop in gilt rates.  This isn't about politics, its about the investors believing they would get their money back.

The other problem is when you look at government spending:
http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/spending_chart_1900_2015UKb_13c1li011mcn_F0t_UK_Public_Spending_As_Percent_Of_GDP

It hasn't changed that much in the grand scheme of things, it is unlikely that Brown would have been able to go on a spending spree, so I doubt things would have been that much different.  However the interest payments would have been, I've posted it before, but it never gets old:

Look at how much we spend on Debt Management.  More than we do on education.  Hell we could probably have done away with Student Loans or something equally nobel if we weren't running so much debt.

Many services also have close links with counselling organisations. Waiting times depend on the area but most are pretty good. 

Basically if you or someone you know is struggling with these kinds of things, go to the doctor and specifically ask about what sorts of talking therapies are available in your area. It shouldn't be the doctor's first port of call to prescribe antidepressants. 

More info on IAPT is available on their website www.iapt.nhs.uk

I reckon it's because it's overcrowded, expensive and the air tastes bad.  I tried living there years ago and reckon I woke up every day in a bad mood because my first waking thought was ""Oh God. I'm still here."" 8 months of that and I had a face like a slapped arse as well.

Talking of bad moods. I hate Windows computers.  Just after lunch I was doing some diabolical confusing code writing and my screen locked. So I rebooted and my portrait code screen turned to mush. Then I turn the screen round to normal and mess around with drivers for a couple of hours. By this point it would only boot in safe mode and restor points did nothing. So thinking that I was going to reformat the whole thing I back up several terabytes of guff, reboot and find it's working normally again.  I am now in a dilemma of replacing the whole thing as its over 10 years old and I think it's a hardware issue, or throwing in a new graphics card and squeezing another few months out of it again.

BTW how do i make it to a single word or name is a link? i wanted to make ""Elizabeth Warren"" a link but i just don't know how.

By age requirements i am assuming you are referring too Alcohol.

The 21st amendment to the United states constitution, passed in 1935, repealed prohibition but was quickly followed by laws that still limited the purchase and consumption of alcohol. Most states set their drinking ages to either 18 or 21 and that was how it was for 50 years, it varied  from state to state. But in the 70's several studies came out that suggested that the human brain doesn't stop developing until about age 21 and other studies found that a large number of vehicle deaths involving adults between 18-20 were connected to alcohol.

This prompted President Ronald Reagan and the US congress to pass two laws; the first was The national Minimum drinking age act which set the federal drinking age to 21. As this does not necessarily change the state drinking ages, the Federal Aid Highway act was passed which stated that any state that did not have it's drinking age at 21 would have it's federal highway and infrastructure assistance and grants cut by 10%. Every state promptly followed the Government's lead, thus the age to drink in every state is 21.

Because most of these independents went off and hitched their cart to the likes of Etsy, Ebay and Amazon all of whom are happy to let you open a 'store' and hawk your wears.  They'll even deal with the nitty gritty of marketing as well for the most part; same in China for places like aliexpress. 

You can't even say that little record shops full of white labels would spring up.  They're on iTunes, which is very welcoming for an indie. 

And I'm sorry but for all the talk of proper butchers and green grocers that happens here the public have spoken.  They much prefer the convenience and alleged cost savings of the supermarket with its attendant quality drop.   

There maybe enough trade for 1 or 2 such shops to be open and in profit but 1 or 2 doesn't make a high street. 

To paraphrase Gabe Newell: Councils need to figure out how to beat 'free', if they can beat 'free' then you'll get the sort of highstreet I think you want.

I'd suggest getting a slightly older carburettor engined bike, it's much easier to restrict those and much less money. 

Failing that, your other option is to use a throttle restriction - this limits the amount you can turn the throttle to a specific spec which would be the 47HP limit. A quick google search turns up no production kits made, so your best bet would most likely be taking it to a garage with a dyno and having one custom fitted - although this will cost you potentially lots of money.

true,CrimsonTideBlueMoon,1970crest,,"As the username suggests, I hail from down south in Alabama.... south Alabama to be exact.  During my junior year at university, I decided that I needed a change in scenery so I decided to study abroad for a semester even further south: Argentina.  I lived in Buenos Aires for 6 months and, predictability, the only thing anyone ever talked about was Boca/River Plate.  Everyone, at least, except for the son in my host family.  He wouldn't shut up about some team named San Lorenzo.  To set the stage, my host family lived in a very high class neighborhood, Recoleta, and San Lorenzo is in a not-so-nice neighborhood called Boedo, so I was surprised when he took me to a game.

Anyway, the whole time we would talk about great San Lorenzo defenders since we both played (well, I try to play) the position. He always came back to the gold standard, one Pablo Zabaleta.  So, when we went to a game I fully expected to see Zabba.  Not so, apparently he had moved to Spain years earlier and apparently had recently been traded to an English team.  We did a quick internet search and found that he had joined a Manchester team that wasn't Manchester United....interesting enough.  It took a us a few weeks to catch a match but we finally found one on tv, I think it might have been a Europa league match, or whatever it was called at the time, and I can't even remember if we won or lost.  That was the only City match I watched my whole time abroad but when I got home and back to satellite tv,  I made it a point to tune into as many City matches as I could (thanks Fox Socer).  It helped me not be lazy on Saturday mornings.  Every game I watched got me hooked a little more.  Bought my first kit in 09-10, and wore it to my first match, which was this past May in St. Louis.  

TLDR: Have never been to Manchester, but I've been to Buenos Aires, and in this case, that was enough.              ",0,1380663163,null,0,false,0,ccj488a,t3_1nia2p,t1_ccj488a,t3_1nia2p,null,1429278534,5,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,5

It's a throttle position restrictor for the GSR 600, and I can get it shipped to the UK for 109.50 EUR 	= 	91.4565 GBP.

Here's a YouTube vid of someone in Germany with the kit; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt3AdRozRHQ

Do the garages carry the restriction certificates, or must I supply one with my restriction kit? If they have them ready to assign, I could be on to a winner here!

Humans evolved with a ""fight or flight"" response to short-term stress eg. *oh fuck there's a tiger*.

Therapy and ""talking cures"" can help with some stresses and strains, especially with problems that have passed but left emotional scars (eg. childhood trauma, loss of a loved one, bad breakup), but they can't cure the mental problems caused by the long-term stress of living in a situation that lacks stability or security.",0,1380665167,null,0,false,0,ccj4xq6,t3_1nij5d,t1_ccj4xq6,t1_cciwdi3,null,1429278204,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,PeelianPl3b,null,null,"I would actually consider looking into whether or not it was actually a police unit. Even if the car is unmarked its unlikely that they would wait that long to pull him over if they wanted to speak to him. After all the road traffic act means a police officer doesn't need a reason to pull someone over. 

 Most unmarked cars are fitted with blues and those that aren't are typically very specialist (as in if it were ever revealed that that vehicle were a police car it would be crushed and all records of it securely destroyed) and wouldn't be engaging in such a stop. 

Its not really the badge you want to see. Unfortunately you can buy obsolete warrant card holders (complete with badge) on ebay, legitimately. You may not be able to spot a fake because, it would be real. Further as a serving police officer, I actually couldn't ID every badge going accurately. You need to ask to see the card. Which shouldn't be a problem. I'd be worried if they said it was.

Was there any sign of a radio in the vehicle (may nor may not be) what did they ask to see? Driving licence, documents etc? How did they check the details? Was your Dad's car's reg read out? 

""Also my dad is convinced he sat on a gun when they brought him into their car, it was heavy metallic and in a leather case, with one of the officers being incredibly eager to take it off him when he handed it to them, is this a possible point of complaint for improper weapon storage or something?"" 

I highly doubt it. Pretty much all forces use the Glock 17 handgun. Its polymer framed so its actually mostly plastic. They're not as heavy as you'd imagine even fully loaded. Also the type of unit that would be covert and carrying firearms, typically quite specialist and mostly used for pre planned operations, not that kind of thing. Not sure what that would be. 

It does all sound a bit odd to be honest. If it were a legitimate police car and officers then it isn't the best stop in the world. There is nothing to say that they can't follow you in your car and they are quite entitled to pull people over and check documentation/ask questions. A lot of police cars aren't rigged up to measure speed and so on (some are, but it depends on what the vehicle is used for). Also they couldn't have issued your Dad a ticket at the time because they were in plain clothes and to do so they would have had to be in uniform which may explain it. If they wanted to give a ticket then they would have to get a uniformed officer down to do it and it would end up being a big time wasting exercise.

Pointing out their modern nonsense is more productive.

Not to mention roles within studios and publishers which aren't production focused, roles like marketing and social media management, events coordination, technical support and quality assurance etc which are all great entry points into the industry.

It also depends where you live. I'm from the UK where gaming culture is very insular and centralised. In the US you really need to live somewhere gaming focused like LA, San Fran, Seattle, NY etc unless you're at a firm in a a mildly obscure location like Gearbox in Texas. 

I'm only just really starting out and I got very lucky, but there's plenty of ways to work with games without working on them... You can easily earn money being involved.

&gt; I think arguing against that statistic is a lost cause.

Depends if you understand where they got the 95% from.  Most people, and unfortunately, most climate scientists seems to be very cavalier [with the statistics of certainty](http://wattsupwiththat.com/2013/09/27/uh-oh-a-signifcant-error-spotted-in-the-just-released-ipcc-ar5-spm/#more-94799).

&gt; The confidence intervals are derived from a statistical model that comprises a straight line with AR(1) noise.  As per your paper “Statistical models and the global temperature record” (May 2013), that statistical model is insupportable, and the confidence intervals should be much wider—perhaps even wide enough to include 0°C.

and

&gt; In that prior climate assessment, buried in a footnote in the Summary for Policymakers, the IPCC admitted that the reported 90% confidence interval was simply based on “expert judgment” i.e. conjecture

Anyway, this is not the place to fight about it, so I'll point you elsewhere.  http://wattsupwiththat.com/ is pretty excellent on addressing IPCC claims in an accessible way; and http://climateaudit.org/ is methodical and scientific in finding faults (and they are faults that are often grudgingly accepted by the IPCC people, they just don't publish that fact) in IPCC reports.

Seriously; if you have any knowledge of science and statistics, you should be appalled at what the IPCC tries to pass off as conclusions.  For example, deleted from the final IPCC report...

The first game I remember was in 1998 against Wigan as an early birthday present. My Mum was a season ticket holder so we, as a family, went to around 15 games a season. My Dad slowly turned more and more blue, too.

My Mum was diagnosed with MS in 91 but it wasn't until 99-03 that it going pretty severe. It stopped her really getting out and about but Dad always took her to at least 1 game a season and a few West Brom games, much to her disliking (haha). She kept her season ticket but by 2004 was completely engulfed by her illness, she didn't manage another game, unfortunately - and passed away in 2009.

Me and my Dad saw it fitting to keep attending matches after she left and we always buy her something from the club shop every year. Only small, mind.

true,Sgt_General,,Do it for Redders 4: Never Stop Doing it!,"They played well in parts and downright poor in others. We looked very nervous at the back and hapless in front of goal. Before their red card, I thought we would be lucky not to concede and afterwards I thought we looked entirely comfortable, then the defence cocked it up in true Leeds fashion and Bournemouth managed to score. Given how poor we were at shooting and creating clear chances against 11 men, I'm not convinced that we would have won without that red card.

On the bright side, I thought that our midfield was much better: Green did well, breaking up play and looking tidier on the ball than Austin has lately, while Mowatt looked very composed (a few misplaced passes aside) and was still prepared to sprint after the ball in the final minutes of the game. However, as soon as we reached the final third, we seemed to hit a wall and struggled to pull anything off. There was little movement and (well-executed) creativity for the most part, which is something we will really need to address.

The really annoying thing is that we had the 20-a-season Championship goalscorer in Becchio, then Warnock sold him for some magic beans. I'd definitely have him back, given the chance. But in general, I don't mind if he's wiry or built like a brick shithouse - I just want a striker who knows where to find space and will find the back of the net more often than not. We had a lot of 'pinball' moments in their box after the red card, which involved our players missing the target from around six yards out at least twice. It was embarrassing.

McDermott was very much in the 'Doesn't Matter; Three Points' camp after the game, which is the attitude we have to take, but there were a lot of worrying aspects for us in the game.

The idea of tackling and taking control of the ball. ie the tackler or fellow team mate reclaims possession as a result of a tackle, should be refereed to as a “Turnover”, or “tackling turnover “, that way an accurate % can be calculated. For example, 10 tackles in a match, Lucas has a 80% tackle success rate, and only a 50% turnover rate. Meaning Lucas successfully dispossessed an opponent 8 of the 10 times, while only 50% of successful tackles resulted in a turn over, so 8/10 tackles and 4/8(1/2) went to a teammate/himself.

true,strolls,null,null,"I particularly hate the tories, and their policies, but I don't think they're solely to blame - I reckon they're merely the epitome of some of the worst aspects of political British culture. 

I mean, David Cameron will [hug a hoodie](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/ktdvp/look_who_i_met_and_had_a_quick_political/) and I'm pretty sure any of the clowns in his cabinet would buy a sandwich for someone who's hungry.

I was about to say that they'd probably lend £100 to an acquaintance in desperate need, but this probably illustrates the problem - I doubt if anyone in the UK cabinet has any friends or acquaintances for whom money could become such a desperate problem.

What they appear to object to is the institutionalisation of charity, allowing the state to make it compulsory, not understanding that this is necessary for it to function in a massive modern society like ours.

Cameron used to tout this ""big society"" idea, which basically means he'd love to volunteer at his local library giving reading lessons to disadvantaged kids, if he had the time. It being that final clause which illustrates the problem - there are lots of ways in which we'd all love to contribute to improving society, but for most of us many of those things remain no more than good intentions. We actually need a government to co-ordinate these necessities.

I honesty think Labour are as much to blame for this as anyone, because in the 90s they saw Blair as their salvation from the wilderness of the ""failure of socialism"", and under him they echoed this capitalistic prosperity narrative - they never challenged the idea that the economy is the most important thing ever. Now when the economy has gone to shit we have nothing else, because we threw it all under the bus in the pursuit of affluence.

the most cost effective way of treating anxiety and depression (in my opinion only) is to try and treat the root cause before you treat the condition.

I honestly believe the increase in depression and anxiety in todays life is partly the increased diagnosis rate (change in criteria) but mostly as a result of everyone comparing ""lifestyles"" and particularly baselining their own existence against fantasy aspirational lifestyles via media or general interests.

There is no doubt that constant comparison to fantasy  characters (celebrities) and their associated trapping not to mention continual comparison to your friends propaganda at how amazing their life is ""facebook"" the more disillusioned you will be.

Tackles fall into the ""destroy"" category, also a very important defensive quality, but not the first priority of a defensive player. Perhaps the best way of calculating the effectiveness of a defensive player would be to incorporate this ""delay"" quality into the ""destroy"" quality for a combined statistic that represents both. Thoughts?

EDIT: Just thinking a little more on the subject. The dribbled past statistic is definitely a key component to the quality of a defensive player.

TFA quotes the guy as saying ""They should stop genuflecting at the altar of youth, Hamlet doesn't need a hip-hop sound track for young people to enjoy it.""

This echoes the title of an article from a 2011 issue of *The Daily Mail*, [""Why Gove is right: Hamlet doesn't need a hip-hop soundtrack…""](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2067103/Why-Michael-Gove-right-Hamlet-doesnt-need-hip-hop-soundtrack-.html)

From [the image used to illustrate that article](http://i.imgur.com/XLLqm6x.jpg) a reverse image search tends to suggest that it's referring to [the Royal Shakespeare Company's 2009 film production of the play, which starred David Tennant.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet_\(2009_television_film\))

With all respect to Mr Gove, I suspect the Royal Shakespeare Company knows more about Shakespeare than he does. 

Wasn't Shakespeare the Tarantino of his time? Simple murder / revenge type stories, plenty of blood and drama to grab the attention and get bums on seats?

When you have grammy-winning white blues-rock guitarists saying ""[to me, hip-hop is where rock used to be](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayer#Change_in_musical_direction_and_John_Mayer_trio_.282005.29)"", collaborating with Kanye West and receiving accolades from Jay-Z - yeah, I'm pretty sure old Billy S would have been down for expanding his audience. 

English teachers showing their kids the RSA film version of a play they're studying seems like just the same thing as happened at my posh public school in the 80s.

I'm not saying the bloke is wrong, these are a few soundbites snatched out of a speech that was presumably an hour long, but it seems that the Tories care about racism when it suits them. Thatcher was famously scornful of antiracist mathematics, ""whatever that is"" because it ""robbed children, little children, of opportunity"". This guy has the credentials, but he's preaching the cultural superiority of an all-white Shakespeare cast (Othello excepted).

Holy fuck, I just looked back at the article, and apparently I'm not making that up: ""Young people need more not fewer dead white men - by dead white men I mean the Western literary canon. Don't knock my mate Mr Gove, he sorted me out with this sweet little £1000 an hour public speaking gig"".

There were episodes in season 5 that really dragged--the one where Morgana uses the aging spell to infiltrate Camelot felt like it had been done five or six times already--but the finale more or less worked for me.

The season closer with the immortal army was cooler, though.

true,notnotcitricsquid,null,null,"The *basic* idea is that the schemes the government are running lower the barrier to entry on home ownership. The traditional difficulty comes not with repayments, but the deposit. The schemes available reduce the deposit that you need, it is replaced by a government loan that you repay later on.

Think of it like this:

Normal: House price £100,000. 10% deposit (the lowest amount you need for almost every mortgage) is £10,000 so you'd need *at least* £12,000 savings to buy a £100,000 house if you got a 90% mortgage.

Help To Buy: House price £100,000, the government give you a loan of £20,000 and you are required to have £5,000 in savings, then you approach a mortgage lender with £25,000 ""deposit"" and you get a 75% mortgage. Then as you repay your mortgage you also repay the government. So you get a house and the upfront cost is half of what it would be without help to buy.

Whether or not the scheme is a good idea depends a lot on your situation, the **biggest** consideration for you is this: why do you not have any savings? Having no savings is bad, *really bad* and you **cannot** successfully own a home living month to month, you are responsible for repairs, you're responsible for shit that happens out of nowhere and could cost thousands to fix, if you can't afford to do that then you can end up in a really *really* bad position.

Help To Buy (and other schemes) are not to help those in a bad financial place get home ownership, they're to give a boost to those on their way to home ownership. If you have no savings whatsoever you first need to address that serious issue, then consider home ownership. 

Personal opinions on the value of help to buy etc. vary, some think they're a good idea others think they're not (after all you now owe the government money and your mortgage lender) but they are a viable idea. Some considerations incl. the restriction on specific new build properties, although that ends in 2014.

Please address your financial issues before even considering home ownership further, living month to month is not maintainable.  ",0,1380682463,null,0,false,0,ccjawg0,t3_1niz70,t1_ccjawg0,t3_1niz70,null,1429275350,6,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,6

The ban was not given lightly (we never like having to ban people from a subreddit we hope to make very inclusive) and was given not because he disagreed with /u/LokianEule's position on the legitimacy of Genetic Looms and other such elements from *Lungbarrow*, but because he personally insulted her on multiple occasions even after given explicit requests to please stop and other formal warnings.

That's what I did! My husband is a huge, truly geek-level fan of all things sci fi, with Dr Who ranking among his favorites. He likes to have shows on in the background while he works (from home) so, I was introduced to Dr Who because I'd catch whichever episode he was watching when I got home from work. He'd already seen them all so he'd just choose one he was in the mood for.  

I saw almost all of them in that shuffled up way, some of his favorites multiple times. 

I really enjoyed each one as a stand-alone episode. 

Aaaanyway, I recently started from the beginning and I have to say, I love Dr Who even more now. I'm not even all the way through my orderly viewing, but understanding where each episode fits into the story makes it deeper. I'm glad I got to watch each episode for its one-off enjoyability before I got to watch each in context. You can't do that the other way around (if you see them in order first, you'll never experience the one-off outside of the context). I'd have loved it either way, but I think watching them out of order the first time adds to the depth of my love for the show.

Possibly because I was hooked that way (?) I'm in the minority as my doctor is the 9th, and my companion is Rose. Some think series 1 is too campy, but that's part of its charm for me. Plus, I just really like the two of them together and he is a BAMF Doctor. I'd do whatever he said, no questions asked.
