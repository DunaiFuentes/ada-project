for Michael Cox's interpretation of why back 3 doesn't really work in the EPL where so many teams play 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1.  

Juventus are the prime example of using back 3 in the last year or two but originally they used it only against top teams like Napoli who played a back 3.  They matched them up to kill the game and then get a draw or nick it with a lucky break or piece of individual skill.  It was so successful for them that half-way 2011-12 they began to use it as their default formation. However, Italy does not have so many teams who stretch width across the pitch the same way as EPL teams, has more teams who already play back 3, and few teams who can match Juve for quality of its side as a whole. 

From personal observation of LFC using it this season in EPL and UEFA Lge, I think in addition to the defensive reasons against it, it ruins our pressing from the front.  A CF pressing the 2 CBs, and wingers pressing FBs force the opposition to play the ball forward quickly and most likely long, ceding possession back to us.  This is a key principle of Brendan's 3Ps philosophy (passing, pressing and penetration).  With Luis as the striker, and with his energy, he can easily keep 2 CBs under pressure and lead from the front with his pressing, setting the tempo for the rest of the side.  I have been quite impressed by Sturridge's workrate at doing that since Luis was suspended as before he came to us he didn't have a reputation for working hard or taking one for the team.

3 at the back is something that may occasionally work, such as when we played Chelski just after Torres left i.e. when the opposition were not prepared for it, or mid-game, if you are chasing a goal with the opposition pushed back and you have a man spare at the back you want to replace with a forward thinking player (a la Mourinho in the Carling Cup final against us in 2005).

Firstly; condemning an entire race/religion for the barbaric, violent acts of few individuals is exactly the uncivilized, irrational reaction that has propagated even worse and more widespread death and destruction throughout human history. Regardless of their religious justification it is essential to not assume that every single Muslim or middle eastern supports these kinds of people. Violent extremism is not unique to the middle east or to Islam. Have we forgotten Anders Breivik? A white Christian who personally massacred 69 people, mostly teenagers in Norway not but two years ago. 

Secondly, it always perplexing to see understandable outrage over violent religious extremism turn into it's own religious extremism. To say that being put to death for their behavior like dogs is too light a punishment is an interesting parallel to the protests of western imperialism in the middle east. You are literally decrying an entire people as less than human under the guise of a man who preached non-violence, compassion and understanding, and even worse you do so because they're acting with the same illogical religious biases as you.

Please don't assume I'm blind to the larger issues here. What happened was unforgivable and the perpetrators of this violence should never again know freedom. But we cannot lose our heads in the face of adversity, especially in such a fragile international political climate. I don't think anyone wants to see more violence, but if the acts of these men make you feel that way you are part of the same problem they are.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"It has been around for a long time. Here's Orwell in 1941:

&gt; The reason why the English anti-militarism disgusts foreign observers is that it ignores the existence of the British Empire. It looks like sheer hypocrisy. After all, the English have absorbed a quarter of the earth and held on to it by means of a huge navy. How dare they then turn round and say that war is wicked?

&gt; It is quite true that the English are hypocritical about their Empire. In the working class this hypocrisy takes the form of not knowing that the Empire exists. But their dislike of standing armies is a perfectly sound instinct. A navy employs comparatively few people, and it is an external weapon which cannot affect home politics directly. Military dictatorships exist everywhere, but there is no such thing as a naval dictatorship. What English people of nearly all classes loathe from the bottom of their hearts is the swaggering officer type, the jingle of spurs and the crash of boots. Decades before Hitler was ever heard of, the word ‘Prussian’ had much the same significance in England as ‘Nazi’ has today. So deep does this feeling go that for a hundred years past the officers of the British army, in peace time, have always worn civilian clothes when off duty.

I must admit, I don't like soldiers going around with their uniforms on. I have nothing at all against the men themselves, and think they should be fully supported by the country for what the country has asked of them. But the military should not be trying to gain popularity with the public in this way, as in [the BBC article below](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7211979.stm):

&gt; British soldiers may be encouraged to wear their uniforms while off-duty in an attempt to boost their popularity with the general public.

&gt; The possible move is part of an ongoing review into how best to improve the public's perception of the military.

Soldiers when off duty should be solely private citizens. Their uniforms are there for when they are in the process of discharging their duties.

Edit: FWIW, the guy who was attacked wasn't in uniform, so none of this applies to this case. And, of course, soldiers should be subject to the same protections as everyone else within society, they shouldn't have to hide what they do, and they shouldn't be in danger on the streets of Britain.",0,1369324940,null,0,1369325608,0,ca4ihhq,t3_1ewaiu,t1_ca4ihhq,t1_ca4embc,null,1431058847,20,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,20

So far, the first two episodes took 4-5 weeks to film for Sherlock S3. They're currently on break since Freeman (and maybe Cumberbatch?) need to finish some filming for The Hobbit. Peter Jackson said that The Hobbit filming will conclude in 10 weeks, which puts it at the tail end of July. Since Freeman stars in the film, you can assume he'll be probably there for the whole block. So Sherlock filming can't start again until the first week of August, since even if they get back right away, they still have a week of prep (read through, etc) before they film. That means filming would FINISH in early September.

I can't find how long it was between end of filming and start of broadcast for series 1 me 2, but if we go by Doctor Who--which admittedly probably has a longer post-production per minute of episode since it uses special effects a lot more--then it will be several months before they begin airing Sherlock. While end of November may be optimistic, I'm personally betting on an air date near the new year.

So I shall break character and say though fans fell in love Ten(nant), Eccleston himself deserves a lot more credit than he gets. He brought Who back to life, literally as well as fictionally. Yes, there were writers and directors and series creators behind him writing great episodes for him, also some pretty bad ones, but he made them all fantastic by delivering them with his all. 

More strikingly, he walked a hard line, in between old-Whovians and the newly created fans who came in at the series reboot fresh and new and became new-Whovians, and by in large united them both. That is no small feat, his tenure in the TARDIS was short, but he did awesome things in the *time that was given him,* and was again as he said in the end... *absolutely fantastic!*

I don't think it was distinctly a warning about extremists from war torn countries as much as a warning against our own government. Does anyone still really believe we do our part in invading these countries out of the kindness of our hearts? Thats the government line, and its a goddamn lie. We invade for resources and control, that is all. In fact, in all honesty..we don't have a real government any longer, we have banks and corporations with a 'face' to the people. These banks and corps allow (and encourage) beheadings, rapes, murders, collapse in these countries in the name of government, but out of sight, out of mind right? As long as the beast is fed. What these guys did in London was disgusting but I have a big issue with the way the media is playing it. Manipulation everywhere you look and it is so exhausting.

Anyway, the whole thing feels off. Why is a woman with a bag wandering towards the guy like nothing has happened? Why are people so chilled and have not fled the scene? Why is his accent so bizarre? I have grown up around these mixture of accents in London and it feels off. A mixture of London and home country would be expected, but his accent only changes to home country when he does his terrorist soundbite after TRYING to get filmed. It is like his home accent is being emphasised on top of a thick London accent.

I wonder what is left to happen for the remainder of this crazy May, lets see..so far:

Boston marathon

Texas explosion [youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZKE6Yh33ww)

Syria attack [youtube] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zUTKJ03zmk)

London beheading [youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkQHArjRlV0)

And a month or two before that we witnessed LAPD cops running around LA shooting random people to find Dorner, then burning him ALIVE for an audience of millions. Thats not to mention Sandy Hook in December.

Oh, and some Immortal technique because, why not?

ap·pear·ance [uh-peer-uhns] (noun)

-1. the act or fact of appearing, as to the eye or mind or before the public: the unannounced appearance of dinner guests; the last appearance of Caruso in Aïda;  her first appearance at a stockholders' meeting.

-2. the state, condition, manner, or style in which a person or object appears; outward look or aspect: a table of antique appearance; a man of noble appearance.

-3. outward show or seeming; semblance: to avoid the appearance of coveting an honor.

-4. Law. the coming into court of either party to a suit or action.

-5. appearances, outward impressions, indications, or circumstances: By all appearances, he enjoyed himself.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"We could spend £2m on a player and we would all want that player to do well.

The issue i have with paying £20m for Benteke is that it is £20m and you had better be a really, really impressive player to warrant that amount of money.

Keep in mind the pricing of the following players.

Hazard - £35m

RVP - £27m

Oscar - £25m

Ballotelli - (Sold) £17m

Santi Cazorla - £16m

Joe Allen - £16m

Gaston Ramirez - £13m

Daniel Sturridge £13m

Keep in mind that in Germany Marco Reus was bought for £15m this past season.  

Benteke is a quality player but saying we should spend £20 so we don't lose him when Chelsea pays £30m doesn't make sense. Ballotelli ,Sturridge , Cazorla and in Germany Reus all went for less than £20m. Ballotelli (the agravating twat that he is) showed he can score in any leaague, Sturridge (10 goals in 14 games for LFC) showed he can score on par with Benteke, Cazorla was one of the impact signings of the season and Reus is one of the most sought after players in the world.  All were bought for less than £20m.

We can't compete with Chelsea or City or United on a cash level so we have to be smarter than them.  which means if we drop £20m on a player we cannot afford to miss, that player has to be a 100% guaranteed standout for us from minute 1.

Maybe Benteke will be worth £30m after next season, hell maybe he will be worth £50m.  But the safer bet for something in the £15m - £20m range would be Soldado (4 straight 20 goal seasons in Spain), Alvaro Negredo (2 25+ goal seasons in the past 3) both of who are also capped for Spain.  A safer bet would be to go after multiple players like Bony, PEA, Van Wolfwinkel, Keibling, or Villa who would cost less than £15m.

true,Sunshineplusunicorns,silence,Silence,"Please note, this is all my take on it.

&gt;Minor quibbles, but I HATED the opening sequence, narrated by Clara. 

Not much you can do about this. I liked it. I felt like it finally gave Clara some substance other than just being ""the impossible girl"", its the first hint we get at who she actually is.

&gt;Likewise for the ""Introducing John Hurt"" thing at the end. What was that about? Don't break the illusion and start talking about actor names inside the show. I don't care about John Hurt, I care about whatever character he plays, and it seemed wildly out of place.

I don't know if you noticed, but Moffat played with a couple different aspects this episode. One of them was breaking the fourth wall. Addressing the audience, and hopefully making the audience uncomfortable with being addressed. It's your voyeurism being addressed. Sometimes its really fun (Shakespeare did this occasionally. ) and sometimes, you're left feeling like you've been seen.

 It happens at the beginning with the guy in the cell, talking about the Whispermen, and then again with John Hurt.  Both times felt very intruding. Like I'm watching something I am not supposed to be. Touching again on John Hurt, this isn't a complete episode. It had the feel of the beginnings of an episode. You *are not* supposed to feel **any** closure in this episode (minus Clara). Which obviously, you didn't so it worked. 

&gt;2) Lazy scripting
Why did River say the doctor's name to open the tomb? Never explained.

She was saving the Doctor and his friends. She knew that he would *never* say his name. Her saying it, was to once again save him.

&gt;The great intelligence ""died"" stepping into the doctor's lifestream, and was scattered all over time and space. Its stated numerous times that to step into the stream is to die. Clara then did it, and was also scattered, and saved the doctor. Hooray! But then the doctor did it and was fine? Ended up ""inside himself""? And somehow Clara was there too, and he could rescue her? So you don't die then, it seems. But in that case where was the great intelligence - why wasn't he there inside the doctor too? Zero continuity: You die, oh no you don't, &gt;oh look we're rescued! LAZY LAZY LAZY.

The Great Intelligence died because Clara went back and helped the Doctor. The GI did succeed. Jenny died, and Strax died. But Clara jumping into the time stream and saving the Doctor, eliminated the GI. Yes, she died. I would look at the Doctor's timestream as a sort of purgatory. Had he not jumped in and saved her, she would have been stuck there forever, doing the same things over and over again. Saving him over and over again. As for him saving her, we'll just assume for now, that he knows of people having done it before and can save her.

&gt;The great intelligence himself....the master architect of this plot to end the doctor, but why? Who was he? Where was he for the past two series? Absolutely ZERO build up in the previous six episodes to lead to this point. He just popped out of nowhere for this INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT series finale, and then failed and was defeated in about 4 minutes.

Simple plot device. He's been underneath the surface making small appearances, but his use was just to get the Doctor to his tomb, and thus have the Doctor jump into his time stream where we run into the real purpose we went to Trenzalore= The other Doctor.

&gt;Side note - where was that paramilitary organisation that kidnapped river? What happened to them? We're they working with the GI?

I can't answer this without thorough research. IIRC, she helped defeat them, but I'm not sure IIRC. haha.

&gt;Which leads to the failed event build up itself. The doctor must NEVER go to Trenzalore. EVER. Fate of the universe, etc. Except he did, and it was all peachy, AND it was always going to be peachy because as soon as they mentioned that stepping into the timestream scatters you across a person's timeline, it became immediately obvious that Clara would do this to save the doctor (which is why he keeps encountering her), and so obviously it was all going to be fine. Drama disappears for the rest of the episode, everything ends up wonderful, absolutely zero fallout. He must NEVER GO THERE? It appears to have been as dangerous to him as eating a freaking peanut.

The reason he can't go there, is simply because of spoilers. His grave has his memories, all the things that have happened to him beginning to end. If he knows what's coming, he might start doing things differently and thus altering time which could have disastrous consequences. (Think back to Rose saving her dad. She did something really simple and it rippled through time and changed things it shouldn't have.) 

&gt;River song is a library hologram? And the doctor has ""never replied to her"" when she talks to him because it hurts too much? Have you seen her pop up in the recent past? Have you EVER seen hologram river chatting to the doctor who stoically ignores her? No? Me neither! So a big emotional closure piece pops out of nowhere with no justification and no build up, making it nothing more than a weird distraction shoe-horned into the plot.

River and the Doctor have a **massive** off screen relationship. They go on loads and loads of adventures together. It is not foolish to think that this is an extension of that relationship. Also, he's a grieving man. She's always with him, because he loves her and mourns her and remembers him. 

&gt;Also, he can touch the hologram! Apparently! He can grab and kiss what it was stated MOMENTS BEFORE is nothing but a digital projection. Because, you know, that makes perfect sense.
Thats all I remember from the top of my head, I'm sure there was more at the time that annoyed me which I've forgotten about.

She's imaginary. He's talking to someone imaginary. He even comments on it when he ""kisses"" her, because she's not actually there. He's just imagining her. 


As mentioned, this is not a complete episode. I mean it is, but it's a prelude to whats to come.

Soldado, Negredo are both proven veteran strikers who would fit the system both would be in the £15 - 20m range.  PEA and Bony and Villa would run less than £15m. Vydra, Keibling and Remy all less than £10m.

I just wouldn't want us blowing £20m on a player (who while very talented) has a single season of note in a major league.  Especially when you can get players who have had multiple seasons in major leagues for the same or less, and you can get players who are similar in potential for less than £15m.  

Really what i was trying to get across is that when you spend £20m you had better be damn sure that player is worth it because for less than £20m you can get some pretty impressively talented players.

Who knows, maybe we can get Benteke for £13m and we will all rave about the brilliance of Levy (and deservedly so).

* The Great... who, again?

Yep, there's not much to say here. So far as I can recall, The GI appeared in The Snowmen, The Bells, and then this. He's hinted to more as a dark puppeteer that operates from the shadows and who's machinations are more important than his presence as a character. He didn't really show up often enough to justify his heft in the final episode, and because of that, his vendetta against the doctor comes off as sort of hubris born tantrum. C'mon, we've seen Daleks and Cybermen take defeats more gracefully than this guy. The point of the episode is less the resolution of the GI arc, and moreso the John Hurt revelation. 

* Dem military blokes

Assuming you mean the organization that kidnapped River as a child, (Melody) Then, yes, I believe they worked for the GI. The point of abducting Melody was to have a Timy Wimy child that they could fashion into a Doctor Killer. Obviously this failed. They made an assassin, and all The Doctor did was marry it. The point of this was to kill The Doctor before he ended up at Trenzalore. Which brings us to the next question...

* Oy Doctor, we don't want you going to Trenzalore, so we kidnapped your mates to make you come to Trenzalore

Yep, ""The Doctor must never go to Trenzalore."" If the 'right' Doctor goes to Trenzalore, then he'll bring all that death and destruction that we see in future Trenzalore (Where 11 goes in this episode) after the massacre. It is assumed now that the purpose of the silence is to prevent the War at Trenzalore by stopping The Doctor before it happens. The only reason that GI calls 11 out to Trenzalore is because he feels he will both kill The Doctor in the most definitive way possible, as well as simultaneously exact his revenge. Now that the Doctor knows both of his eventual death at Trenzalore, as well as the carnage that takes place there, we now need to ask how he would be able to stop it from happening, especially when it appears that the perpetrator is, as the GI surprisingly named, the Valeyard.

* River Song, Radio edit

This is a bit tougher to explain. River is still based in the library, and is not so much a hologram as she is a psychological presence. She's only there because of her connection to Clara, who in turn is telepathically connected to the Tardis. If The Doctor is connected to the Tardis, then this explains how he can interact with her. However, it is also possible, given by his saying that she ""is always present to him"" that she is in his thoughts, and psychologically connected to him, but that he never acknowledges her because of guilt or pain. This makes sense when you consider that the only reason River is visible to us in the first place is because she's being seen through her connection with Clara. 

* The Doctor, and his ability to make out with everything including air

This is dramatic in nature. He states a bit later, ""Nobody else in this room can see you, so god knows how that looked.

You say we aren't designed to have an 'out and out' striker, but how many times in the past 2 seasons has a ball been on to Torres to get in behind the back 4 which he simply hasn't been quick enough to burst onto and score as we saw so often for Liverpool? Similarly, it doesn't matter what system you play during corners and set-pieces etc. when the ball falls to a top striker they can make the space to finish. This is what we haven't seen enough of from either Torres or Ba and why I don't think it is a bad idea to get a top quality striker in who makes goals out of nothing regardless of what the midfield is doing.

Out of interest, which 'striker' (Chelsea or not) do you think would ideally fit our formation (don't say Messi or Ronaldo...)?

**Leviticus 20:9**

""For anyone who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death; he has cursed his father or his mother; his blood is upon him.""

**Leviticus 24:16**

""Whoever blasphemes the name of the Lord shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall stone him. The sojourner as well as the native, when he blasphemes the Name, shall be put to death.""

**Deuteronomy 20:17**

""Completely destroy them - the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites - as the LORD your God has commanded you""

**Psalms 55**

""Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.""

**Exodus 22:20**

""He that sacrificeth unto [any] god, save unto the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed.""

**Deuteronomy 17:2-7**

""If there is found among you, within any of your towns that the Lord your God is giving you, a man or woman who does what is evil in the sight of the Lord your God, in transgressing his covenant, and has gone and served other gods and worshipped them,[...] then you shall bring out to your gates that man or woman who has done this evil thing, and you shall stone that man or woman to death with stones.""

**Deuteronomy 17:12**

""Anyone arrogant enough to reject the verdict of the judge or of the priest who represents the LORD your God must be put to death. Such evil must be purged from Israel.""

**Exodus 22:19**

""Whoever sacrifices to any god, except the Lord alone, shall be doomed.""

**Chronicles 15:12-13**

""They entered into a covenant to seek the Lord, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and soul; and everyone who would not seek the Lord, the God of Israel, was to be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.""

**Zechariah 13:3**

""If a man still prophesies, his parents, father and mother, shall say to him, ""You shall not live, because you have spoken a lie in the name of the Lord.""  When he prophesies, his parents, father and mother, shall thrust him through.""

**Deuteronomy 13:13-19** (My personal favourite)

""Suppose you hear in one of the towns the LORD your God is giving you that some worthless rabble among you have led their fellow citizens astray by encouraging them to worship foreign gods.  In such cases, you must examine the facts carefully.  If you find it is true and can prove that such a detestable act has occurred among you, you must attack that town and completely destroy all its inhabitants, as well as all the livestock.  Then you must pile all the plunder in the middle of the street and burn it.  Put the entire town to the torch as a burnt offering to the LORD your God. That town must remain a ruin forever; it may never be rebuilt. Keep none of the plunder that has been set apart for destruction. Then the Lord will turn from his fierce anger and be merciful to you. He will have compassion on you and make you a large nation, just as he swore to your ancestors.""

Then we close out the Amy/Rory story and that's all well and good.

Then there's the whole period where The Doctor hangs out by himself, meets Clara again and she dies AGAIN and now it's REAL weird. Up until this point I was still totally cool with the season because we had episodic resolution mixed with a little dangling carrot of stuff later on.

Finally The Doctor meets present-date Clara and all over-arching plot development comes to a screeching HALT. Aside from The Doctor repeatedly saying that he's gonna figure out who she is, he NEVER makes any headway or even gives it any real concerted effort. Even in terms of long-term big picture villains, I had completely forgotten about the GI as anything of consequence.

true,YourLizardOverlord,eng-sussex,Scotland --&gt; West Sussex,"&gt;If you were given control today, what practical steps would you take to make sure something like this wouldn't happen again?

Most of the factors which led to this can't be controlled. There's no way we can stop the occasional random nutter from going AWOL.

We can mitigate the consequences though. The danger isn't the damage the occasional headcase can do, the real danger is the damage we do to ourselves in response. For example the government clamping down, the media creating an us-and-them narrative, idiots on facebook creating an atmosphere of hostility and paranoia. 

I don't know enough about the motivation of the attackers, but in many of these cases they are hopeless pathetic losers who were never taken seriously. Now suddenly they are on the BBC news and everyone is talking about them. The risk here is that other pathetic losers learn the wrong lesson from this. It's important that the government and media don't big this up too much.

Finally if it turns out that the attackers had mental health issues, this will reflect on the dismal state of mental health care provision in the UK. If I were in the cabinet I'd use this as an excuse to loudly announce extra spending in this area, both because it will genuinely help and because it will diminish the attackers in many people's minds. I don't much like the stigma against people with mental health problems, but since it's there we might as well use it.

I added to your second argument that Yilmaz is good (cfr. the video, and the quality he shows when scoring, not the opponents lack of quality; did you even look), and that age is not always a defining factor.

To me, Benteke isn't someone we should overpay for unless AVB really wants him.  I think he is a good striker and will do well in the league maybe even a top 4 team.  But i don't think he is at the talent level you overpay to get.  

A player like Isco to me is someone you overpay for, even if he isn't a striker his talent level and play in the CL screams top end quality.  And if we are going to be a CL team (which we will be) and we really feel a striker keeps us from being in the chase for a CL and sitting in 3rd/challenging for 2nd (which i think is at least partially true) then i we need to at least consider overpaying for someone like Higuain or letting Pep determine what he is doing at Bayern and at least call about Gomez (we won't get him but it doesn't hurt to ask).  To me those are guys who are worth overpaying for not Benteke.

true,orbitalia,english,English in Sweden,"It is absolutely astonishing and mindboggling.

Sweden has THE most generous level of social welfare, and is THE most generous in the world regarding immigration (More immigrants from Iraq in Sweden than in the whole of the US).

Most Swedes see this as a major slap in the face. They have done absolutely nothing to deserve this kind of behaviour. It is almost always obvious when crimes are committed as there is such a low level of background crime here, people who have recently landed in the country almost always bring with them a crimnal background. Worst of all seems to come from the second generation whose parents seem unable to control.

I regularly read the uncensored Swedish forums (www.flashback.org) and there is movement growing against uncontrolled immigration now largely due to the continued crime and rioting.

The police have no powers, and are way out of their league, so there are now no-go areas for the authorities. 

Most of this is hush hushed by the strongly politically correct media.

What's it all about?

As usual a combination of factors, a 50% youth unemployment that is only getting worse by the day, a highly competitive job market where you have to have a Msc or Phd to even have a chance of getting a job, a general degradation of society here with lack of discpline, poor schools, ghettos, resources stretched to the absolute max for example one class might have 30 pupils, of those there maybe 17 different languages spoken, and maybe over half the class has not mastered basic Swedish. Swedish society works on the model that everyone tries their hardest to contribute (basic tax rate over 50%) and work extra to make ends meet, but that whole culture is dying out with the selfish self obsessed, respectless classes that live in the ""förort"" (ghettos). I am genuinely concerned about the future.

true,LostDigit,null,null,"There's the obvious stuff that everyone knows, the trouble in the Middle East. No prizes for guessing that. But, I'm convinced that can't be everything, or even, the main issue. A significant number of these people are from the West. They are second/third generation immigrants or even native converts to Islam. There has to be something else going on.

My theory is that every religion has people like them, but the degree to which they become violent is dependant on how their views are combated. I don't believe religious moderates in any - Abrahamic at least - religion are capable of combating their own fundamentalists. In too many ways, the fundamentalist position is either, too close to their own, or equally/more powerfully backed by scripture than their own. Both the Koran and the Bible are atrocious sources for moral teachings and it's no surprise that if enough people take guidance from it, we'll end up with a few who really believe some of the abhorrent stuff in there. Beheading enemy infidels? That's in there. We're only lucky they seem to have forgotten the bit to remove each of his fingertips as well.

Why doesn't Christianity in the West have so many whackjobs running around? Because over the years it has built up a secular community around itself that protects its own religious moderates from the fundamentalists. As the secular community around Christianity strengthened, so did the excesses of the Church shrink. Now, I know, correlation is not causation, but it implies it, and I feel there are reasonable mechanisms by which a secular community has a moderating effect. A secular community doesn't have the same weakness of scripture that religious moderates do, but equally, do not feel like outsiders. Because culturally, they're the same. This is probably the most important aspect of it. By having within your own culture, non believers who you love and respect, you disarm fundamentalists of the worst of their capabilities to do harm to others who do not believe as they do. You learn to love your family and friends long before and much more powerfully than you do scripture. Islam has to come to terms with atheism and non-belief. It has to shed itself of the sexism. The penalty for apostasy must go, and if remembered, be so with deep shame. 

The idea that we'll have any peace from fundamentalists who kill their own family members who dare question Islam is absurd.

Yeah, I really liked the layout that year... unfortunately, we've got about 1000 more people since that year, and we've got to make the best use of the space we have. There's a couple of issues with The Space (Sofa Room) - It's got a lot more space than RPGs will use at our current games / players ratio, so it would always have to be mixed with other things which make noise. Those TVs are not movable, so they restrict the places where we can put tables because of risk of damage. It can't open past 6pm on Saturday, so no option for a night time slot. Now, there up sides as well, like it has 6 TVs built in, and it's wired with loads of extra plug sockets... but unfortunately those up sides make it really, really good for console gaming - Not so much for RPGs.

Organizing the layout of Q-Con is like a tower defence games... you just just look at how many people go to each activity and the pros / cons / size of each area, then the decisions almost make themselves.

Back then the only way someone could gain salvation was through the law. But the death of Christ changed all that.

Jesus taught that it was what was in a persons heart that would be judged more harshly then the deeds they did.

**Mathew 5:21-22**
“You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, ‘You shall not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.’ But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister, ‘Raca', is answerable to the court. And anyone who says, ‘You fool!’ will be in danger of the fire of hell.""

**Mathew 5:43-44**
“You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ 44 But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.""

**Mathew 22:36-40**
“Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?”
37 Jesus replied: “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”

**Mark 12:30-31**
""Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’ The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no commandment greater than these.”

I'm not blind to the terrible things some people do under the banner of Christianity, or the justifications people find in the bible for them. But you are wrong to call those verses the teaching of Christ, or to draw comparisons between Christianity and Islam.

Assuming that you're only going for one day, I'd choose Saturday:

-I'd be sure to check out the board games area and play some of the games from Steve Jackson Games. They have a really friendly demo team called the Men In Black who introduce new players to the games and teach them how to play. They also run impromptu competitions, and other take part events which are good fun.

-There's a number of ""panels"" and QED talks on games design and writing, but I think those would be a bit heavy for kids... although there's some beginners art classes for drawing anime styles and 2D styles. I'm not 100% sure of the timetable off hand, but there's a couple of professional artists who run this and give help to people wanting to learn. There's also an art competition which they can enter their drawings into.

-There's a treasure hunt, but I'd think carefully before you're trailed round the whole building 10 times :)

-There's LOADS of video games with everything from Mario to DanceDanceRevolution machines, and a mix of free play and competitions. We have most of the newest hardware and games, but the timetable will be up on the web site.

-The role playing games normally last about 3 hours each, and while I love them... again, I think kids would get bored after a short while, but some of the board games run a similar thing for shorter sessions. Where's also wargames, and plenty of demos being run, but some of the longer games take a bit to get into.

-CCGs (Collectable Card Games) are a really good way for kids to get involved... there's traders who will give away free starter kits, and run mini competitions for kids on games such as YuGiOh.

-Finally, there's a coulple of special events on throughout the course of the day such as costume competitions, Rock Band Live, Game / Nerdy themes bands, music, martial arts demonstrations... and I'm probably sure I've forgotten about half of the stuff :)

1 - this area looks clean, safe and modern. The buildings have some architectural interest even if they're quite tall and close to the canal.

2 - yeah, this is pretty badly done. It would actually probably look fine if not for the facade.

3 - I actually quite like the Walkie Talkie: it reminds me of the Gherkin. It looks much more interesting than the Shard.

4 - I can't really even see the building in this photo

5 - I agree that this is not very pleasant to look at.

6 - How attractive are you expecting the inside of a bus station to be? This actually looks quite good to me.

7 - All blocks of flats are ugly. These may have sport a slightly ridiculous colour scheme, but the interest that that and the curvature adds makes the whole thing a lot less horribly dreary.

8 - This is clearly an 'artist's impression' so it might not look like this in real life - but it looks just fine to me.

9 - Can't see enough of this to form a real opinion. People seem to think that random variation = bad - would they prefer blank orange brick walls for everything?

10 - I agree. I'm not a fan of the Shard - to me it looks rather squat and blunt.

11 - It's not even finished yet! How do you know it's going to be ugly? You just don't particularly like this shade of green.

&gt;Built during the hallmark of social-democracy, the golden age of capitalism, when capital found enough investment opportunities following the large-scale destruction of World War 2, social housing was frantically erected to compensate scarce housing for the working poor, many which flooded from rural areas. Today, these areas are often predominantly inhabited with migrant laborers of third world, southern or eastern European descent.

The economic recession has hit the poor hardest whilst they see bankers' and wealthy CEOs' profits hit record levels who can blame them for being angry at the way things work. The fact that they've been effectually ghettoized and isolated from mainstream society and lacking a voice in the media makes these riots appear as an inevitable situation arising from the currents social, economic and political climate.

The recent rise of right-wing groups can be attributed to the original working classes of these nations seeing immigrants and not the companies using the immigrants to undercut the original workforce to save on labour costs  as the problem.

* The Silence trying to prevent the Doctor from getting to Trenzalore in the first place
* The Great Intelligence seeking to rewrite the Doctor's timeline once he's gotten to Trenzalore
* Clara re-re-writing the Doctor's timeline after the Great Intelligence has

So in the total if you looked at time travel linearly, there would've been (at least) three timelines:

1) The original timeline where the Doctor gets to Trenzalore and is defeated by the GI

2) The Silence-altered timeline where they try (but fail) to kill the Doctor at Silencio, creating River Song in the process. But the Doctor still gets to Trenzalore and is defeated by the GI

3) The Silence-altered, Clara-altered timeline where Clara undoes the GI's rewriting of the Doctor's timestream

The Hurt Doctor did something so despicable, and it was so secretive and sensitive to the Doctor, Doctor Who wasn't even shown for the time period John Hurt was the incumbent Doctor. If they're planning to show the missing episodes, I hope the make John Hurt look pretty young (to keep the younger doctor after reincarnation thing going) but then post-Time War they age him. Obviously at the point when we saw John Hurt, he was scruffy and old, and had done the despicable deed.

Also in the End of Time farewell to David Tennant, when he's forced to make a decision of whether or not to send the Time Lords back, he's unable to decide, whereas if he did it the first time in the name of the Doctor, then morally he should be okay with doing it again. But the Master had to send them back instead of 10. Which fits the theory that the John Hurt Doctor was the genocidal incarnation at the Time War, and his deeds were un-Doctor-like

Ofcourse given the witch hunt that's followed her around over the last few days this may be seen as punishment enough and that will be that.

Now realistically..

Taking her tweet at face value, considering that the cyclist was not the only cyclist there, infact the cyclist has said she nearly hit another cyclist. So I'm guessing there's other witnesses to this. It could be multiple views that contradict hers...in which case I suppose she could be charged with dangerouse driving, hit and run etc which would be very much the worst case for her.

Other things that might be taken into account - the ride he was on was a sportive (which I did to by chance, I was about 15minutes behind the cyclist in question), there where I believe 300 cyclists doing the ride he did (and another 200 odd cyclists doing shorter distances) so there is a good chance there where a lot of cyclists about. So she should have atleast been aware of the danger (assuming shes was traveling to fast for the corner, which of course needs to be proven)

And them there's the real killer...one of the reasons she has had absolute hell on twitter is because of 2 other images she posted previously. One was her tailgating a smart car, the photo she took while driving, and the other was another photo she took while driving of her speedometer at 95miles an hour.

Now those photos I'm sure cannot be used as evidence, but the media has totally ignored those unfortunately.

The exact same can be said if Mikel albeit indirectly. If you watch many of Mikels passes in to Mazacar then it is usually to them when they already have  a man marking them on their backside and they just end up running it straight back to the defence or getting tackled and losing the ball. In this respect I would much rather have Luiz, he may be wasteful now but he used to be a woefully inconsistent CB but he was able to adapt his mentality. He has vision but lacks the decision making to choose when he should play the tricky pass and when to play the simple one. The more we play him as an Anchor/DeepLyingPlaymaker the better he will get at this. Mikel is largely ineffective and all he does is slow down play. Apart from that he makes literally no contribution.

Your other points on Luiz are entirely valid, although many of them could also be applied to many other incredibly good Defensive Midfielders. The problem is that if we play him in DM then we need another fast CB aha.",0,1369350561,null,0,false,0,ca4s73x,t3_1ewozx,t1_ca4s73x,t1_ca4jqhl,null,1431054199,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

The fact that the cyclist said she nearly hit another cyclist means nothing until somebody else corroborates his statement.

I agree totally which is why I'm not personally taking sides. Just offering up two potential outcomes in my opinion based upon what both parties have stated publicly.

&gt;Please don't go down this road. Evidence of previous cases of bad/illegal driving is not evidence of bad driving in this case, and would not be admissable in court, and rightly so

Again I agree, I was guessing it wouldn't be used as I said. Though the ""killer"" line was a mistake

The issue though (as far as a lot of people are seeing this) is currently shes doing the rounds on TV/radio claiming shes a good driver, that she knows these roads, that she grew up here and would never hurt etc is somewhat hollow in light of her other images, and somewhat contrived, and something of a lie (factually)

Its the boy who cried wolf syndrome..at least in the public eye.


On a personal note...I feel pretty bad for her, i, I think shes made multiple bad mistake, recorded them and now that's back firing In a extremely nasty way for her. Had one of her other images been picked up sooner (say the speeding one) by the police I doubt we would be talking about her now.

On a positive note...I think this has been great for road safety. It's a shame though it takes a case like this todo that

It entirely depends on what you want to get out of the course to be honest, but bear in mind, it isn't something you can just sail through.

First year may seem like a bit of a dull slog, because it covers all the core requirements. PAY ATTENTION TO ALL EMSA LECTURES, they may seem boring as hell, but if you dont get the basics of SPSS down you'll be crying yourself to sleep when it comes to dissertation time.

Second year is the hardest year by far out of the 3. There is so much information to cover, so advice is to get on top of note taking and regular revision of what you've covered. The course content is a little more diverse than the first year, and whilst a few lectures seem ancillary and boring, the rest make up for it.

Third year; so much fun! You choose your modules for this year out of a decent and interesting selection and you've got your dissertation too. Dissertation may sound horrible to you now, but you'll quickly find topics you love during the first and second year that you can draw into and explore through your diss. 

I'd advise you to volunteer in the local mental health scene when you start here, it'll be so much help for your CV if you want to go into a psychology based career. The lecturers at the uni are decently linked enough for there to be a fair few positions.

Many muslims keep their children in secluded communities within Britain, but some of the children do manage to integrate, just by virtue of going to school etc, and they break away from the mindset. It's rare, but it happens. We need to ask these people what the problem really is because they were once a part of the mindset.

I personally think the issue is one of integration. When you allow bubbles to form, it creates a 'them vs. us' attitude. It's also important to explore cultural differences. Some cultural aspects can be integrated, like food, and clothes and harmless traditions, but some, especially with regards to the treatment of other humans just seems incompatible.

Voucher systems can be as abused like any other system, the vouchers end up being traded for cash for example. There's been similar with milk vouchers for nursing mothers, chasing these frauds then becomes a drain in itself and reduces the value given by the benefits system. 
I think the main problem with the benefit system is in it's complexity and the time it takes to process claims fairly. Should someone be on benefits get the chance of say two weeks casual or seasonal work is likely not to take it because they will earn for two weeks and then face a longer period broke while waiting for a new claim to be processed, even if the details haven't changed. 
I always favoured an equivalent of a constant ""national wage"", which is either given as a benefit or taken as a tax allowance, with any earnings above that taxed. That way the unemployed could take any work they had a chance of without losing benefits and eventually get themselves to a position where they cease taking it as a benefit and claim it as a tax allowance. This financial easing-in would also help with the physical easing-in of returning to work for the long-term unemployed.

We never actually saw Rory's parents. Therefore he is actually Batman, the Doctor's real name is ""The Penguin"", and that episode was actually his final triumph over his arch-nemesis.

&gt; You can disagree or agree. I haven't finished the whole season, so a later episode I haven't seen could completely undo my theory 

How can you disprove my theory? Every piece of evidence can be interpreted any way you like, and ""the Doctor lies"" means that you can't ""prove"" anything, because your evidence is all a lie.

Seriously though, as amusing as the line ""the Doctor lies"" may be, it's fucking retarded. No matter what theory fans come up with about what things mean, in the next episode they can and do completely ignore past events, because between ""the Doctor lies"" and ""time can be rewritten"" there's no logical connection between events.

I'm not sure how to feel about this. For a first signing, he's not very inspiring. A good Championship player, I guess, and we've needed someone new in the striker department, but the fact that he's a striker who doesn't really score goals (11 a season appears to be his limit) means that we'll be needing another signing up front. I wonder if he's considering a partnership of McCormack and Hunt up front.

true,mushroomgodmat,null,null,"&gt;These two statements do not add up. You're not taking sides, yet you wish that these photos were brought up to help try her by media, even though they are not legally admissable as evidence.

My point is the public cares not about the legal aspects of the case, they care if she is truthful and remorseful, and its the public that making the judgement against her currently, and it's because of the public shes doing the interviews....so....
If when someone says I'm a great driver it's good to perhaps ask her to verify that based upon the other images/tweets she has taken while driving. Since they are connected in both being tweets and both being driving issues I would have expected a good reporting to ask. And I do think its a shame that this has not come up in the TV interviews.

Taking sides is irrelevant. 

Now, if that makes the interview to risky, the best bet is simply not todo the interview in the first place.

&gt;Firstly, she has held back from giving her version of events until the other version got so bad that she was in danger of losing her job, never mind the personal hatred (including death threats!) she was getting via facebook and twitter. She really had no choice but to go public with her version of events, 

I agree In the 1st, disagree In the 2nd and 3rd point..

2nd point: Loosing her job was an issue before this became news. Accountancy company's are very particular about criminal records (especially one that sponcers cycling activities). Now of course she does not yet have a record. But she knows speeding/phone use at 95mph is potentially going to get you a record, so you have to ask why she did it in the first place as getting caught would lead to potential career suicide. 

3rd point: I think if it's a mistake to go public. She should have kept her head down and people would have gotten bored eventually. Maybe even by now.

&gt;and I doubt she has done anything that at least 50% of road users do on a regular basis (speeding, tailgaiting, etc).

Agree again, I like most are responsible for a bit of speeding. And about a year ago took a corner too quickly myself and rolled my car. I think about it most days, I was lucky I didn't clip anyone, or kill anyone in the process.

So I am sympathetic to her issues, but... Had I hurt/killed someone I doubt I would tweet about it, or boasted about it.

Which of course is a stupid thing todo, but young adults are not clueless to the potential dangers of social media.

&gt;Twenty years ago, she'd have received a small fine and maybe a short ban
Well...to that all I can say is I'm glad fines/bans are better than they where. 

&gt;but now she being vilified nationally as somebody deserving of all our hatred, and that's just fucked up.

Internationally now I think. Is it fucked? ....to the point something small like this has become minor international news...yes.

For my money Lewis is a #10. His best attribute is incisive passing and he's been at his best in a free advanced role (he's rarely played there for us). He isn't a high percentage player who dictates tempo; he plays direct forward passes and moves the ball quickly. 

To Gylfi's credit he really showed he could be really effective on the left. His dribbling, control, and even agility improved to a pretty shocking degree later in the season. Holtby with some time could reinvent himself in a similar manner, I suppose. 

That said, I don't particularly like the situation. One might say it's a good problem to have all these flexible players but ultimately I don't think this policy of sacrificing others to accommodate Bale is sustainable. 

Next year is an important one assuming we keep both Gylfi and Holtby. I think we need to really push towards accommodating more players in their most effective positions. To me that will mean reshuffling the squad a bit and it could ultimately result in us buying a natural left-sided player or cutting down on the number of attacking midfielders we have.

Personally I think Bale's future could still be on one of the flanks. I don't think he's very good at finding pockets of space yet (though he's still learning a new position) and probing different areas like, say, Carlos Tevez does when he plays off the striker. 

I just think we have a bit of a logjam in our attacking positions and it's frustrating to see players sort of wasted.  I understand why it's had to be done of course. ",0,1369355808,null,0,false,0,ca4tng8,t3_1ewh8o,t1_ca4tng8,t3_1ewh8o,null,1431053513,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4

*sigh*

&gt; ""Drummer Lee Rigby or ‘Riggers’ to his friends was born in July 1987 in Crumpsall, Manchester. He joined the Army in 2006 and on successful completion of his infantry training course at Infantry Training Centre Catterick was selected to be a member of the Corps of Drums and posted to 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers (also known as the ‘Second Fusiliers’ or ‘2 RRF’).

&gt; His first posting was as a machine gunner in Cyprus where the battalion was serving as the resident infantry battalion in Dhekelia. Having performed a plethora of tasks while in Cyprus, he returned to the UK in the early part of 2008 to Hounslow, West London. Here, Drummer Rigby stood proudly outside the royal palaces as part of the battalion’s public duties commitment. He was an integral member of the Corps of Drums throughout the battalion’s time on public duties, the highlight of which was being a part of the Household Division’s Beating Retreat – a real honour for a line infantry Corps of Drums.

&gt; In April 2009, Drummer Rigby deployed on operations for the first time to Helmand province, Afghanistan, where he served as a member of the Fire Support Group at Patrol Base Woqab. On returning to the UK he completed a second tour of public duties and then moved with the battalion to Celle, Germany, to be held at a state of high readiness for contingency operations as part of the Small Scale Contingency Battle Group.""

Your right. My point is, if someone says ""I'm a good driver"" and there is photographic proof that says otherwise why did this not come up? It's not public opinion she was doing 95mph, that's a fact. A fact that contradicts her statement.


&gt;Again, you are bringing up things which are not related to this case, and she has not been arrested or charged for.

Nope, and yes...I'm bringing up points relating to the questioning in the interview. She talks about how this can loose her her job over this last tweet, I'm only pointing out that why should she be surprised at this because her previous mister meaner would be enough to loose her the job too. It shows either ignorance on her part or simple carelessness.

I appreciate this wont effect the case, but it does say something about her character. 


&gt;It's difficult to keep quiet when the national press is vilifying you as some kind of evil scum.

Disagree...people are still talking, most of it negative. 

&gt;Did she fuck up by leaving the scene of an accident (where nobody was actually hurt)? Yes. Does she deserve even one tenth of the shit she is currently getting? Fuck no.

Agree...

Let's for a minute assume there is no negative publicity against her...

Does someone who leaves the scene of an accident (hit/run) deserve punishment regardless of the outcome.... Yes, totally. Anything less sends a very bad message. Ditto for the other possible convictions if found guilty (be that driver or cyclist)

Does she deserve the Internet backlash - no (and iv said this plenty of times). Fact remains one should not be connected to the other.

Which is why I still think the interview was a mistake as it perpetuates further media coverage.

I strongly agree with playing with heart. That's why Drogba instantly became the love of Turkish fans.

I wanted to add something about Burak, it'll support what is said above. I've been paying attention to his interviews to understand his mindset better. He has this sort of regret about not proving himself fully. He is very good, he knows it. And he rightfully thinks that he should have been in a higher place by now. You can see it in the way he plays too. He is SO hungry for goals. And that goes a long way. He is really hungry to show what he already has. 

He has the skill, the heart, the desire. He just needs the opportunity. I hope he can go to a good European club that is going to give him the opportunity (a regular starter that is). At the same time I'd be worried if he would be under too much pressure in Chelsea. Maybe the best thing for him is to spend one season in mid level club in Europe first and take one step at a time. Then he can prove himself better and get more trust from the coach and fans. Say he goes to Chelsea now and has a few bad games for some reason (adapting, getting to know the team, the league etc) he'll get benched and that'll be unfair to him.

We've got Suarez but I still think we need another world class striker. I'm still massively undecided on Sturridge. I'm not a fan of his attitude at all. Often he'll only make a run if the ball is perfect. It's annoying that he's not prepared to graft. If only we could morph all the best attributes of Borini and Sturridge together. Borini is all about tenacity and working hard. You know every game he'll be working his arse off. Sadly not so for Sturridge. He can have one fantastic game and then disappear for two where he looks uninterested. If things aren't working out for him in a game, he still needs to graft. If he did that I'd be a lot happier.

One thing I really like about this is the implication that the time the Doctor really got to know River is during the 200 years he spent avoiding his death. I hadn't thought of that before, but it makes perfect sense.

I also like how this timeline places Angels Take Manhattan right after Flesh and Stone in River's timeline. I'm not sure whether that's the author's interpretation or whether it's clear from dialogue in the episodes, but it makes so much sense thematically.

Because pistols aren't legal to own in the UK, giving them to all PCs would be a risk. Armed gangs would have a motive to attack police officers to get their guns. Also when you're trying to restrain someone you don't want to have to worry about someone grabbing your gun and shooting you. And lastly... it would inevitably increase the number of people killed in altercations with the police. We'd rather kill less people instead of 'protecting' PCs by throwing lethal weapons into the mix.

Having specially trained armed response units is a better way of keep the standard of policing up instead of having to train every PC in an entirely different style of keeping the peace - which would create more room for mistakes.

&gt;The overall value delivered for the seven packages is £3.018 billion (BSkyB = £2.3bn = £760m/season, BT = £738m = £246m/season), which marks a 70% increase (£1.25bn) on the current three-year contract shared by BSkyB &amp; ESPN. At 154 live TV matches per year, what this means in effect is that the EPL will be paid £6.5m PER LIVE MATCH, an increase of 260% compared to the previous deal (£2.3m/live match).

&gt;The deal marks a +£14m/year increase of revenue for each football club, with the bottom team in the league to receive more than the £60.6m Manchester City earned this year for ending the season as champion. More money gives the clubs more spending power on the transfer market, and the ability to continue to attract the top football talent from all around the world, but is also likely to have the effect of bloating transfer fees &amp; player wages (history would suggest the majority will flow directly into the pockets of players).

But the Doctor could still remember him just like he can remember the events of JTTCOTT.

Also, [/u/lifelesseyes](http://www.reddit.com/user/lifelesseyes) replied to me and said

&gt;I was thinking perhaps the Hurt doctor was who McGann regenerated into near the end of the Time War, some defeat by the daleks which has forced a regeneration and pushed the doctor past his limit. He then commits genocide and uses the moment. He's disgusted, and luckily since he's within 15 hours or regenerating, he's changes into the Eccleston we know and love, a la Romana in Destiny of the Daleks.
Not what I would like to see, but I could see Moffat playing it out like that.

I think the John Hurt Doctor will be something like these ideas, making him a Doctor that did exist but didn't technically count as a regeneration. I don't think the explanation will be as simple as ""Surprise, we never told you about this guy before even though you should've seen him in one of the flashbacks we've done, or heard of 11 regenerations instead of just 10.""

true,veridical,num2,,"I completely agree with you here. Bale has obviously been formidable this season, but it's come at some cost. Too often we've had four players all trying to operate in the same space - With Bale, Dempsey, Siggy and Ade all in the hole. That said, Siggy has done a good job of adapting to the wing, as you said. He still plays as more of an inside forward than a proper winger though.

I want to see Bale play RW next season, at least for a few matches to see how well it works. Many of his best open-play goals have come from him cutting in from the right, and this way we can keep width while still exploiting his shooting ability. You're right about his difficulty finding space, and he can charge at defenders from any position, really.  That part of his game isn't improved by having him in the centre. This also wouldn't stop him roaming to some extent, as wingers changing sides can be very effective.

I'm not sure what this would mean for Azza though, because the inverted-winger role doesn't suit his strengths. My other qualm is that we are neglecting Bale's crossing ability at the moment, and that wouldn't be improved by putting him on the right, given his right foot is considerably weaker. It made sense for us to avoid crossing this season - Ade has been rubbish, Azza and JD are tiny, Dempsey's all about late entry, and Siggy hasn't shown too much aerial ability IIRC. But with an in-form Ade or a new striker in the box, Bale's ability to produce excellent crosses at full pace should be invaluable, as it has been in the past.",0,1369375681,null,0,false,0,ca4zjug,t3_1ewh8o,t1_ca4zjug,t1_ca4tng8,null,1431050661,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

true,Gellert,Wales,VFR 800 A-5,"Wear boots that cover the ankle and jeans/thick trousers, your own helmet and jacket is nice but shouldn't be necessary, things like this show the instructors that you realise bikes are dangerous.  Show up in shorts and flipflops and instafail.

The gears threw me the first time.  You'll have plenty of time on the yard to get used to pulling off but, keep the revs high so's not to stall, so long as you ease the clutch out you won't shoot off.  Gears on a bike are down into first then tap up into neutral or tap up harder into second, third and so on, tapping down drops you a gear, it doesn't always put you in first which is what confused me.  If you stall, make sure your in first then try again.

If you find yourself in neutral going around a junction or roundabout don't worry about it, just shift into second and carry on.  If you find yourself in second or neutral at a junction or roundabout don't worry about it, just shift into first and carry on.

Remember that the CBT isn't so much about your ability to ride so much as it is about your ability to be safe on the road and explaining to you how to think and act, so long as you show an understanding of the lessons taught and a good degree of safety you'll pass.

Try not to pick up bad habits like I have, turn the key with your left hand, don't use the front brake during low-speed maneuvers.

I'm not a 100% sure but I think the instructors tell everyone that their lifesavers and over the shoulder checks aren't obvious enough so when you go for the test you over emphasize them for the instructors.

Don't get disheartened if you make mistakes, the CBT is the time and place to do so, ask questions and last but not least have fun!

Edit: If you do have trouble with the 125 geared pass on a scooter then pick up a geared 125 find your local learner alley and spend some time just riding up and down shifting gears and doing slow speed maneuvers, ideally with someone to watch the road, just in case.",0,1369376681,null,0,false,0,ca4zrj9,t3_1exp6h,t1_ca4zrj9,t3_1exp6h,null,1431050560,2,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,2

He definitely has a role to play in our squad and would also be a useful tutor for Chalobah and Romeu (especially if he can now speak Spanish).

Mikel rarely does anything other than follow the ball. I wouldn't mind betting that he has the lowest iQ on the team.

Also on a side, Fifa has historically been awful with ratings although Mata is rather well rated. Although in one respect, fifa ratings are very easily linked to this discussion as they are usually a barometer of popularity and media opinion than actually ability.

Listen to what the instructor says. If you're doing it on a geared 125, they'll understand the issues you're likely to have. Don't worry about stalling, they'll understand. All you have to do is show that you're not a danger to yourself and to other road users.

It's not a test. It's not something you can 'fail'. They can say that you're not ready for it and require more training. If they do, take more training! But I doubt they will.

Wear sensible clothes - especially shoes. Even if you don't have bike boots, wear something substantial, not boat shoes or similar.

Don't worry about the gears - I was really worried about that part for some reason. We spent a while just doing loops and u turns and stuff in first gear.

true,Mild111,silence,Silence,"Or it doesn't matter because this episode has so many plot holes, that you just ignore them and watch the story for its emotional content.

The problem I have with TATM is this: Due to continuity errors, the angels aren't as dangerous as our 2 previous angel stories.  
For example 

- IMMEDIATELY after Amy gets zapped into the past, the Doctor and River (INSTEAD OF STARING DIRECTLY AT THE DAMN ANGEL) Proceed to break down and cry as if the angel just left.  

- While Amy is saying goodbye to the Doctor, she is staring at the angel. HOWEVER, she is crying, getting mascara into her eyes, and BLINKing like crazy,

- When Amy and Rory are on the roof, and ""Liberty Angel"" is next to the building, The Doctor and River are looking at Amy and Rory, who are looking at each other, and NOBODY IS LOOKING AT THE LIBERTY ANGEL.

In other words, in this episode, the rule is...""when there is an emotional verbal exchange going on, let's just forget about the dangerous monster that should be killing you right now""...apparently weeping angels like to wait to kill you so that they can watch you say goodbye

I think that this episode just wasn't completely thought through continuity-wise.  It was meant to be a good episode emotionally, but it fails at the logic of Doctor Who science.  
Mr. Moffat, if you're going to use a villain that MUST be observed at all times or it kills/teleports you, then you need to make sure your actors are either staring at it or being teleported/killed.

true,ariiiiigold,null,null,"When I was in secondary school, at the age of around 11, I used to engage in some pretty depraved tomfoolery in the playground. The bottom of the school's garden had a public footpath running along it, one which was rather popular with dog walkers - consequently, one could often find a lot of dog shit peppered throughout the path and surrounding grass. One of the games we played was aptly named **Shit on a Stick**, of which the rules were as follows: somebody would source a branch, spear it onto a piece of dog shit and then proceed to chase the rest of the players until successfully launching it at them. The person hit would then be tasked with holding the stick and the game would resume until the bell rang or until we tired. There was no real way of winning, for the game just entailed chasing one another with a piece of shit on a stick, but that's the result of a game designed by a group of 11-year-olds. 

Anyway, on one summer's day, as we were playing this game - a chap by the name of Henry decided to join us uninvited. He was from the year above and had the reputation of a rapscallion. He wielded the stick high and proud before chasing my friend Gumble into a corner and smearing the shit all along his shirt and trousers. Henry clearly had no respect for the rules of the game or the passion of the sport, for he had wantonly broken a number of sub-laws (namely, no smearing), and saw the game more as an opportunity to attack people with shit - rather than an exercise in peer building and frittering away the hour of lunch, which is what it was. 

After ensuring Gumble was OK and ferrying him to the bathroom for a clean up, horrified by what happened to him and eager to avoid the same fate, I darted inside the school and sat in my classroom. I watched the game continue behind the safety of a window, Henry still gleefully chasing my terrified peers with a shit-impaled stick. As I turned around, in the corner was sat a boy by the name of Tom - I hadn't spoken to him much before for he was in class 3A, while I was in class 3B. We were in the same year, but separated by the walls of a classroom. He was drawing dragons and eating a ham and pickle sandwich. I sat next to him, he asked if I wanted to help him draw. I picked up a pencil and began to scribble. A bromance was born, one which remains strong to this day.

The video linked here is about what to expect on a CBT.


I hadn't been on a bike before my CBT.. I wish someone had told me these things so here you are:

* Don't dump the clutch! (let it out smoothly when changing gears you will find out why very quickly).
* If the bike won't go into neutral just roll it forward a little bit.
* Remember that you have to turn off your indicators after turning (They don't work like a cars)
* When you are stopped if you don't know what gear you are in just tap down on the gears a bunch of times to make sure you are in first.
* You need to do everything smoothly - Throttle/Clutch/Brakes.
* Plan ahead - i.e. try not to be last minute breaking etc, if you know you are coming up to a stop when slow down in good time.
* Don't grab the brake or let off the throttle mid corner, look where you want to go and you will go there.
* Don't be scared of cars but be aware of what all other road users are doing around you.
* Get a good sleep the night before!

* Most importantly - **Have fun**!!  It is not about passing or failing, just relax.  For the record on mine no one 'failed'.

My ISP is [Andrews and Arnold](http://aa.net.uk), and I have an FTTC connection with them (which is the same as Infinity) at 40mbit down/10mbit up.

They take on lines with faults (and offer to fix the fault within a month or [let you migrate away from them for free](http://aa.net.uk/broadband-trial.html)).

They also have great customer service, you'll always get through to somebody who knows what they're doing, and they go the extra mile, too (My line developed a fault outside of office hours, I jumped on their IRC channel at about 8:30pm and the company director personally investigated and raised a support ticket with BT that night).

They also do not do any sort of filtering, surveillance or censorship at all, and they don't shape your traffic (although the BT backhaul might, if your area is congested).

The only hang-up with them is the price. They have two different pricing structures, the first is a [unit-based system](http://aa.net.uk/broadband-units.html) where you pay for a set number of 'units', which are consumed at different rates at different times of the day. 9-5 weekdays is peak time and all other times are off-peak. They only count download,so any video uploading you do won't use up your units. There's a minimum of 2 units, so for 40/10 you'd be paying £30/mo and for 80/20 you'd be paying £42.

The second is an [any-time package](http://aa.net.uk/broadband-home1-info.html#more) with fixed download limits (50GB/mo, although you can top that up). So for an FTTC service at 40/10, you'd be paying £35/mo with a 50GB cap, or £45/mo for a 150GB/mo cap. 80/20 would be £5 extra.

The other option is a cost+ scheme like the US company Halliburton?

As to your point about role reversal, if I remained in spirit who I am now I guarantee upon all that I hold dear I would never have done what those two 'men' did. I would have fought physically and through whatever civic avenues I could exploit against those who attacked my person on liberties respectively. Preemptively, I would never think of attacking the innocent and would do all that I could to merely incapacitate or capture those that at some point in the future would become a combatant.

The point is moot though, since these men are British and of Nigerian extraction. They were not the victims of the atrocities to which you referred, merely empathetic towards those that were and as a result had a strong political grievance.

It helps to read about what the likes of Reading fans, who've watched him for five years, think about him. By all accounts he's an old fashioned hard-working player who gives everything and runs all day, upsetting defenders with his pressing and work rate.

If McCormack is going to be played in his natural position (striker) then im happy with Hunty doing the dirty work and flicking the ball onto Ross.
Good 1st signing if true but I cant say enough, PLEASE dont base this signing on his goal scoring because thats not what hes about regardless of the title 'striker'.

true,Skot_88,cnty-expat,Expat,"I did my Masters dissertation on arming the police. Below is an amalgam of excerpts that goes towards explaining the police's ""force continuum"". It highlights how while there isn't an official shoot-to-kill policy (except for specific operations, such as Kratos), the employment of firearms to incapacitate is always treated as inherently lethal. If anyone would like the full dissertation, references or suggestions for further reading feel free to message me:

The force continuum is a scale of ""control tactics"" considered to define the appropriate use of coercive force employed by an individual police officer. Generally beginning with the mere presence and oral commands of an officer, the continuum can escalate through weaponless physical control, to non-lethal weapons, and finally to lethal measures. The use of such an array of coercive force in confronting a suspect may be deemed appropriate so long as the actions can be justified according to the sanctioned objectives of persuading, complying, impeding, and finally incapacitating a suspect.

The range and the severity of the police’s institutionalised force continuum can most often be determined through the means, techniques, or tools of coercive force they elect to arm themselves with. While the majority of the continuum consists of a range of varying intentionally non-lethal means of physical force —such as unarmed defensive techniques, truncheons, mace, baton-rounds, CS gas, tear gas, or TASER stun guns—in practice their can be no guarantee that such weapons lack the capacity to kill under certain circumstances. However, the most extreme and perhaps most notably controversial of contemporary means in any continuum of force utilised by the police, for the express purpose of deploying lethal force, are firearms.

According to *The Firearms Act 1968*, a firearm is a ""lethal barrelled weapon of any description from which any shot, bullet or other missile can be discharged"". The lethality of such a weapon is taken to mean that it is likely to cause injury of the sort which might result in death. Hence, while seemingly obvious, the risk of injury and death clearly enhanced and implied by the deployment of firearms. For indeed, it cannot be stressed enough that the use of firearms, even, or especially by the police, is always potentially fatal, regardless of training or finesse, as irreducible misses and mistakes can never be fully taken into practical account. To this extent, it can thus be seen as axiomatic that the use of firearms by the police exists at the most extreme end of the force continuum, the firing of which can never truly be justified as seeking to accomplish any lesser objective than having to immediately incapacitate a suspect by potentially depriving them of their life.

&gt; If you look into it, I'd say there is a strong chance the Hindu and Buddhists ""terrorists"" are fighting against Mulsims.

Well let's look into it because you obviously haven't. Let's start with what's known as Saffron Terror in India. Groups of Hindu terrorists fighting for [Hindu Nationalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_Nationalism) (eradiate all non Hindus from India including but not limited to Muslims)

Staying in India, The National Liberation Front of Tripura is a Christian terrorist group allegedly funded by the Baptist Church of Tripura. Their targets are Hindus. In 2001, there were 826 reported terrorist attacks in Tripura, in which 405 people lost their lives and 481 kidnappings were made by the NLFT and related organizations such as the Christian All Tripura Tiger Force. Labh Kumar Jamatia, a religious leader of the state's second largest Hindu group, was kidnapped by the NLFT, and found dead in a forest in Dalak village in southern Tripura. According to police, rebels from the NLFT wanted Jamatia to convert to Christianity, but he refused.

The fact is that while Islam does appear to produce more terrorists at this time, it does not make Islam a non-peaceful religion. In 2010, there were 1.6 billion Muslims in the world, that's about 23.4% of the total population at the time. 2,869,000 are in the UK (0.2%). 2.9 million Muslims in the uk but only 10 attacks or suspected attacks from Muslim terrorists in the UK in the last decade. Make up a number (literally made up) and say 6 Muslims were involved in each attack

60 terrorists/2.9million total suggests that 0.000002% of Muslims in the UK are terrorists.

&gt; Thinking like this, will only make things worse.

I disagree, terrorist attacks are made to divide. [And it's working](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/may/23/attacks-muslims-spike-woolwich-attack)

Not all bad people are Muslim, not all Muslims are bad people. The correlation is so small that we need to deal with the bad people not the whole religion.

I have strong memories of how these games would begin, someone would walk round the playground crying ""Join up for playing Chainey"" and interested parties would link arms until a suitably large group had been amassed and the games would begin.

I moved schools half way through Year 6, and was glad when the kids at my new school invited me to play British Bulldog - ""I know this one"", i thought ""it's where you had to run between two safezones until you get harmlessly tagged by a tap on the shoulder and then have to join in being 'it' in the middle"".  Imagine my suprise then, when rather than a polite tap on the shoulder, my opponent introduced my midriff to his firm, bony shoulder and proceeded to rugby tackle me to the ground in an act of great and furious violence.  Seems my old school had obviously been far more namby-pamby when it came to playground violence than wilds of South Gloucestershire

The first few years of my secondary school career were marked by the advent of Blood Bowl, based on the popular Games Workshop tabletop game.  It was as ludicrously violent as you might imagine, a no holds barred rugby style free for all that involved countless pile ons and dirty tricks, leaving us all muddied and bruised by the time it came to head in for afternoon registration.  The game became slightly more terrifying as some of my peers began to hit puberty and began to bulk up into their hulking new frames and the level of ultraviolence slowly crept up.

The school decided to take as stand when, unbeknownst to us, an Ofsted inspector was patrolling the perimeter of the school field watching the melee play out, when one of the larger boys planted a shrimpy, underdeveloped kid face down into the mud and triggered the most extraordinary rage-out I have ever witnessed.  A flurry of bites, kicks and punches later, and the larger boy limped off the field with blood pouring from his nose and with a broken finger, straight past the understandably perturbed Ofsted inspector.

Needless to say, a stern assembly was had and the sport of Blood Bowl was once again consigned to the table tops alone.  Although I think all in all this was probably for the best, had we still been playing as 16 year olds I think there would have probably been a fatality!

On an unrelated note, I've always thought that there would be some good social science research to be done in finding out how these games and memes propagate around primary schools - its fascinating that everyone seems to have such similar memories and experiences, but with interesting little local and regional variations.",0,1369394462,null,0,false,0,ca52dbh,t3_1ey01b,t1_ca52dbh,t3_1ey01b,null,1431049332,4,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,4

true,Apostasy4ever,smith,Smith,"Incoming wall-of-text. I apologize. I like the way you think so I wanted to bounce some of my own thoughts off you.

The doctor did start the time war. Quoting the wikipedia article on it [""In Genesis of the Daleks (1975), the Time Lords—having foreseen the possibility of the Daleks conquering the universe—send the Fourth Doctor into the past in an attempt to avert the Daleks' creation, or affect their development to make them less aggressive.[2]""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_War_(Doctor_Who) So that means John Hurt can't be the Doctor that started the time war.

I had always thought the idea that John Hurt was the original ""Doctor"" was the least logical because you can't break a promise without making it first. Also, because of what's already been said previously. In the 20th anniversary special *The Five Doctors*, the First Doctor refers to himself as the ""original"" and in the 1996 *Doctor Who* movie, Paul McGann, with Sylvester McCoy on screen, states both [""A Time Lord has thirteen lives and The Master'd used all of his."" and ""In all my travels through space and time, and nearing the end of my seventh life...""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(Doctor_Who) 

No one said Moffat has to follow every single thing stated in previous episodes, but I would think he'd be trying very hard to follow it unless he had already set it up and it's something fans would want him to change anyway. For example, the Doctor being limited to 13 lives or 12 regenerations. Since River blasted the Doctor with all her remaining lives and we had only seen her use 2 and mention a 3rd, it's safe to assume Moffat could say the Doctor has 9 additional lives. I think all the crazed fans like myself would be okay with that since we don't want the series to end. But changing who is the Original Doctor could potentially upset many fans, especially ones who watched the original series.

But it doesn't seem logical to me to have John Hurt be Doctor 8.5 that ended the Time War, either. Like you said, he's always owned up to having killed millions by doing that, so how can it be some big secret if he's telling all his companions about it? But that would mean John Hurt did some thing worse than double genocide. 

I believe that we've all assumed up until now that Smith, as the 11th Doctor is the 10th time he regenerated. (11th regeneration if you count Tennant having regerated twice.) But if we do count Tennant and add John Hurt in prior to Smith that would make Smith the 12th regeneration (but still allow him to be considered the 11th Doctor since Tennant didn't change forms and Hurt is not considered to be ""The Doctor"".) Since the Valeyard is said to have come between the 12th and 13th regenerations, wouldn't that mean that once Smith decides to leave the show, the next regeneration ***must*** be The Valeyard?

If I was a writer for that show, having to write a season or more of The Valeyard would be a nightmare. How in the world would they do that since he spent a lot of his time back during the era of the 6th Doctor? Most people who are new to the show don't even know who he is or what he tried to do. How would you fix that? Have the first episode after Smith's last season be nothing but clips from the original series? I think it would be much easier on the writers and producers of the show to have Hurt be The Valeyard and only be in the 50th anniversary special. The only thing I can think of that would be worse than the double genocide of the Time War would be what The Great Intelligence was trying to do. Exactly what The Valeyard tried to do, since his intent was to have the 6th Doctor executed. All the worlds the Doctor has saved since the 6th.. hundreds and hundreds of worlds - destroyed. None of the current series Doctors have ever mentioned The Valeyard, which fits with this potentially being the Doctor's biggest secret. We also know that Clara had no idea who John Hurt was because her sole intention of going into The Doctor's time stream was to save The Doctor, and John Hurt is not known as The Doctor. So he must have called himself something else.. which makes it plausible that he could be The Valeyard.

But even John Hurt being The Valeyard doesn't make sense because The Valeyard is inherently evil. He wouldn't do something ""for the sake of peace and sanity"". It's rather insane to try to have yourself executed prior to your own regeneration.. unless it was actually his intention to cause an enormous paradox in the middle of Gallifrey.

They expect to see the next great player to magically turn up on their debut when that is never the case. Blackman was poor, but was never fully at fault for the goals he conceded. Personally, i think that was the case because Luiz left Christensen on his own without any support, where as Cahill nurtured him throughout the game.

Sorry for the delay - hectic here!

It's a mixture of all sorts. We are mainly in the IT Security area, but we need support in this instance for a hosting company we work for - the job is initially triage of calls, and then once proven in that we move people to endpoint security and encryption and other products. No experience needed as we prefer decent people over certification etc. We provide training on everything you'd be expected to support.

Send your CV over if you are interested to jobs@technicalsupport.net

It's true that he almost never actually hears her, as seen when the 3rd Doctor drives past her in the flashbacks. I would say 11 didn't recognise her from Gallifrey (when he was 1), because that was a long time ago, and she was just a random technician who told him to take a different TARDIS. 

There was no need to explain *why* 11 could hear her - just that he finally did, especially thanks to recognising her voice from Asylum of the Daleks.

It seems that her echoes have become past companions, at least based on the 'flashbacks' to classic Who, where she's dressed as the companion, kind of a 'reveal' to the fact that a particular companion or passer-by was an echo.

Now, in *The Doctor's Wife*, Idris/TARDIS says that she stole the Doctor, rather than the other way around, and there's Clara - presumably incarnated as a Time Lady - urging the Doctor's first incarnation to take *this* TARDIS and not the other one.

But wait. The TARDIS said she stole the Doctor, not that someone told him to take her.

And, there's that whole scene where River asks the Doctor why he doesn't wonder how he can still see her if Clara has disappeared into the time-scar.

So let's put all this together. Clara's echoes:

... don't know the Doctor but are compelled to help him.

... can exist in any time period contemporary with the Doctor.

... don't have to be human.

... don't have to look like Clara.

... helped the Doctor to the right TARDIS - one with the door unlocked.

... have at least one of them still present after the original Clara disappears.

The only conclusion I can draw from this is that *the TARDIS herself is an echo of Clara*.

Sure, there's some flexibility, but less with more conservative and extreme kinds of faith than with more liberal and moderate kinds, and less where most of a entire culture, nation, community follow the same religion.  That goes doubly so if your culture mandates penalties for changing or abandoning your religion. At the very least we can say for most Muslims, since that's who you are talking about, especially deeply conservative ones, most had their religion chosen by accident for them and it is an accident of birth which will last for life or take substantial life changes, fortitude and bravery to change.

Being a police officer is, at most, _somewhat_ shaped by family tradition (some police have parents or other relatives who are also police).  For the most part though, it is a vocation or a career choice which a person freely chooses because of their beliefs, or selects from a range of other options.  It's possible some people might choose it as a needs-must decision simply to earn money and feed their family, but it's likely that the recruitment process, which selects for various characteristics and traits and skills and so on will weed out some of these, and many more will leave if the job isn't compatible over time or when something better or more suitable shows up - it's certainly not a bottom of the barrel last resort job as joining the army can be for some people.

true,UncleSneakyFingers,null,null,"&gt;The usual round of condemnation from Muslim leaders has begun and Muslim members of parliament will be rolled out to proclaim that this is nothing to do with Islam. That is not good enough. Violent extremism is a cancer in the midst of Muslims and it must be excised.
There are two key issues here. First, the historic failure to clamp down on those inciting hatred. I remember going to see my local MP in leafy Ruislip/Northwood in 1993 when I was a student at the London School of Economics to show him literature being handed out by a radical Muslim group on university campuses. I told him that the Government had to crack down on this fast. He smiled and nodded politely. 
Twelve years later, in 2005, when I was standing as a parliamentary candidate in the marginal constituency of Watford, I again encountered this group handing out flyers outside the local mosque. They asked to interview me and I was probed for my views on homosexuals. I responded that if elected, I would seek to represent homosexuals, just like every other constituent, to the best of my ability. They responded by proclaiming that homosexuals should be killed. That such views are allowed to be peddled is unacceptable and dangerous.
Second, and more important, is the ineptitude and utter failure of self-proclaimed Muslim leaders to tackle these extremists head-on with intellectual argument. There is a complete disconnect between the community “elders” looking back starry-eyed on the motherland they left behind decades ago, and a younger, much better-educated, British-born generation with totally different priorities.

I couldn't agree more with what this man is saying. I would appreciate some thoughts from frequent visitors to this subreddit regarding this issue. I have been reading a lot of comments related to this most recent event, and was stunned by the near unanimity of apologists who actively down playing this event. It seemed like most common thought was that this guy did it just for the lulz. But what this author is saying is completely correct. That we shouldn't be dismissing these seemingly monthly atrocities as the work of some small minority. This small minority is obviously much larger than people are willing to admit, and the perception that violence is a justifiable means to and end is in fact pervasive, and not a view held by just a few.

The author points out that radical literature is routinely passed around on campuses, in the streets, and outside of mosques. Is this not a concern to you? Does this not trouble you? Do you wish to see your government crack down on this behavior, or are you comfortable spending your afternoons on the internet making excuses for people?",0,1369401329,null,0,false,0,ca53nox,t3_1eymr6,t1_ca53nox,t3_1eymr6,null,1431048652,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

[This](http://www.cernunnos-homes.co.uk/index.php? the pcallback=image&amp;pid=287&amp;width=&amp;height=&amp;mode=) graph shows the energy prices were stable for about 15 years, rising below or rougly in line with inflation (RPI). Not the best graph but quite comprehensive. 
 
A [better graph]. (http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmenvfru/37/3702.gif) with less detail, again shows a decline in energy prices in real terms for around 15 years. 

My point would be that privatisation has largely been successful. This is despite the recent price hikes since 2006, which also rose in the US so it wasn't a case of price gouging by private firms IMO but rather production costs worldwide rising.

We for the first part of our Europa League campaign had neither. Compared to Rafa's Chelsea in particular, who won the competition and had good domestic cup and league positions. 

It's a good thing we are not going to partake in the EL next season as our squad needs significant strengthening if we are to pull it off. Getting drawn up against a team as stacked as Zenit didn't help us either, but the good news is that this year we can concentrate on the league alone and a Champions League spot. With some luck and hopefully few suspensions/injuries we can make a good run in the cups/league, but without a solid and rotatable squad we won't be able to compete in Europe and domestically at the same time.

As an aside: can we all agree that Rafa is a genius with regards to European Competitions? I talk like our squad when we regularly challenged for the CL was large but it was in fact very small. Lets not understate the tactical brilliance of the man we had in charge, much less the indomitable form of Gerrard/Carra/Alonso etc. 

Furthermore to get back to the point suggested by OP: we got 2pts a game when Sturridge and Coutinho got regular games for us and bolstered our attack accordingly, something we did not get to benefit from in the EL ties with Zenit either.

Because all the socialism never, ever, ever, has to infringe on anyone!

Actually, you know what, fuck it....  Your whole sentence is irksome.  Why?  I'm glad you asked!

&gt;Stable social systems can exist without subsuming everything around them.

Citation needed.  What is a social system?  What do you actually mean by subsuming, I hope we're not using elegant words to try and make our point appear legitimate.   There are many definitions for a [system](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/system) but I'm am going to go on the idea that a social system requires interdependency, as all the defintions there demand it.

So we have a 'system' which means bit's are interdependent on each other, it is perfectly natural for some to be more so than others, but a problem comes when something doesn't simply fit in the system.  This can be as a result of the design goals of the system, or the implementation, but often the former drives the latter so it is difficult to have a system which doesn't require the participants to behave in certain manner.

A simple example would be the right to clean water.  If the system gets its water from the well, you can't dump a lot of dead diseased animals in it.  Sorry, not allowed.  It doesn't matter if your socialist or capitalist, that will kill your system, it is dependant on water.

This means that someone who acts against the system, who breaks certain dependencies of it, have to be stopped or contained / moved on.

The more efficient the system, the more tolerance it can have for certain key components (the requirements on are inelastic by nature) but ultimately there are still some immutable boundaries for function.

The solution to bad speech is more speech, not a prohibition on that speech.

It may be tiresome, but it is also correct to the point of blinding obviousness.  Your idea that ""more speech"" can solve all problems is a nice fancy, but takes no account of how people actually behave.   This isn't about morality, it is about letting people who have been defamed get recompense for the actual harm they have been done, and providing a deterrent to stop people doing it in the first place.

Lies can cause actual real harm.  If you are the right person or organisation you can put someone out of business with a lie, drive someone to suicide, or get someone killed.  Extreme examples, but that does not mean they wouldn't happen - they clearly would.

There are problems with current UK libel laws - thats obvious from the way people exploit any loophole to get their case heard in the UK.

true,plastic_apollo,dalek,Dalek,"We have a lot of books, which means we have a lot of bookcases. Eventually we stopped buying cases and started building our own; my fiancé worked as a carpenter, so he builds them, and I paint them.

Each shelf (top and bottom) gets painted, along with all interior panels and the two side panels, for a total of 16 faces, all of which are painted separately (!). Rather than do a solid color or a design, I paint each panel as something new, usually an homage to something I enjoy…although I do go out of my way to try and make the panels on the undersides (that are only visible if you stoop to get something off the shelf and look up – or, if you were a child, perfectly visible) a little bit creepy. I want to have kids in the future, so this is a long game strategy for my amusement. 

I’m currently working on the third painted bookcase (fourth total, since one of them I did for a friend). I’m not particularly great at painting by any stretch of the imagination, but I enjoy doing this as a hobby and it makes for really cool bookcases :) Here are some other panels from this one and past ones.

my reply was referencing the obvious falsehood of the ""wisdom"" of such glib platitudes against the ontology of the experiential - India is rife with sectarian and economic divisions, and this is maintained by an institutional caste system. 

we can &lt;all&gt; break down 'a wise man once said' statements with a smidgeon of scrutiny - therefore, they contribute nothing, serving as little more than preclusionary devices to avoid acceptance of ones own personal responsibility to being a 'good' human. 

lest ye forget, Gandhi was &lt;primarily&gt; a nationalist... (not without cause imho.)

&lt;tl;dr&gt; Gandhi was talking about India, nearly 75 years later she remains a society based mainly on 'caste' which continues to lead to periodic outbreaks of religious and economic violence against those 'weakest' you (standing on the shoulders of Gandhi) mention (which is itself a point of contention as 'weakness' isn't a minimally-bounded metric - it fluctuates...'the wheels of fortune'/dharma and all that. cf: jews.)

Secondly and to address your point, just because someone doesn't consider themselves a hero doesn't mean they aren't. The lady who sat with Lee Rigby not knowing if these animals would turn on her is a hero, Doctors, Nurses and Police officers who sacrifice or risk their lives are also heroes. But that's just my point of view and you are entitled to yours. I personally don't consider football players heroes and think it's a national disgrace the way they're glorified in the press but I'm aware a lot of people do look up to the overpaid clowns.
 As for Help for Heroes I agree, why not support anyone whose dedicated their life to serving the general public, fortunately we don't live in a country were many Doctors, nurses and Police regularly lose limbs as a result of doing their job.
 And for Afghanistan, you're right, it probably has been made worse by our presence and I don't want this to degrade into a rights and wrongs of our involvement in the middle east discussion, but while our troops are out there, there have been quite a few home grown terrorists travelling out to Pakistan to ""have a pop"" at them.

If you ask the young whippersnappers, they are more likely to stare at you blankly, but it's still not impossible.

Surrealist humour is very much a British heritage. A lot of our humour relies on absurdity or outright nonsense, and has done for hundreds of years. Dilbert is popular here because it embraces the sheer absurdity of office life, whether the reader is an engineer or not. Garfield was popular because he fucking hates everything, just like us (generally we can be quite dour, compared to Americans). I have no idea why Peanuts was successful here - I never liked it, but maybe a Peanuts fan can tell you what they liked about it.

Calvin and Hobbes was frequently (and especially in the three you've linked) heavy-handed soapboxing about issues Watterson believed in, and the British (generally) dislike being preached to by their entertainment. Then there were C&amp;H strips which were genuinely sweet, which is also something we don't really go in for, viewing it as sentimentalist nonsense. And then there were the C&amp;H strips which were sheer genius, but so difficult for the casual reader to find because more often than not they came across the table-thumping or the sappy before getting that far.

My favourite, off the top of my head, is probably Calvin banging nails into a table and his mum's like ""What are you doing?!""

I recommended Spaced to him. He didn't get it.* Paul was pretty dire. Although Wright wasn't involved in that.  
This final instalment of the trilogy seems to be the same storyline again with just a different set of 'bad guys', which isn't exactly filling me with confidence. It always seemed like an odd choice for them to basically remake the same film three times in different genres.  
Judging by the trailer it's interesting that they seem to have acknowledged that they have indeed aged considerably since this concept was probably dreamt up. Pegg and Frost can't really get away with playing the stoner looser archetype that was been at the heart of their characters since Spaced. They're in their forties now and no longer nerdy outsiders but Hollywood successes.  
This film will undoubtably be entertaining, but I don't know how much it will have of what originally made me fall in love with their work to truly satisfy.

(b) the use or threat is designed to influence the government or to intimidate the public or a section of the public and
(c) the use or threat is made for the purpose of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause.
(2) Action falls within this subsection if it:

(b) involves serious damage to property,
(c) endangers a person's life, other than that of the person committing the action,
(d) creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public or
(e) is designed seriously to interfere with or seriously to disrupt an electronic system

His delivery to the American studio audience is slower, dawdling and droning, waiting for them after each line.

Shaun was really just an extension of that world into the zombie genre. Scenes like the vinyl flinging, or the zombie joining in with the electro sing song, are magical movie moments, but they seem to come directly from the writers lives so they're immediately relatable to those of a similar generation/ilk.  
In Hot Fuzz rather than a kind of fictional version of themselves, they were playing characters. So inevitably they lost some of that personal element that made them so relatable, for me at least. But at the same time gain a mass appeal that reaches beyond the nerds, stoners and twentysomethings.

The reason Reading went on that run a couple of years ago when McDermott took over was because of the partnership of Hunt and Long. Hunt would kick the shit out of the center forwards constantly while Long would be just waiting to get into a goal scoring position. It was like poetry... 


He's not so dissimilar to Becchio and the idea that you're underwhelmed by a hard working player who's been playing at a top tier Championship club for the last few years (whose signed on a free) is kind of baffling.

If the system lets the person be murdered, they have been infringed.  If you do not let the other person have their free will and murder that person, they too are infringed.

There is an insurmountability in that circumstance due to physical constraints.

true,Veridas,eng-kent,The nutter round the corner.,"Watching the guy's rant video on youtube on an admittedly anti-islamic channel, I noticed a few things.

Now while I doubt the guy in the video was exactly the Hunter S Thompson of Islam, he did seem to believe that what he's saying was the truth. That's hardly a unique aspect, but what is unique is his terminology.

Specifically, one line.

""So get rid of them, tell them to bring our troops back, so we can, so you can all live in peace""

Now, while I do love his little correction at the end, he did not correct the ""our.""

""Our"" troops.

I think this man was more invested in England than we perhaps give him credit for, and while his mind was undoubtedly corrupted, perhaps by Islam, perhaps by people claiming to be preachers of Islam without actually following it, perhaps simply by drugs or one too many run-ins with the EDL or what the hell ever, but this man was trying to make a political point.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The Silence don't seem to hate the Doctor.  All their plans seem less about revenge, but more in preventing the Doctor from dying on Tenzalore and going into Time Web form.  Hell, they might even be a remnant of the army the Doctor forms for the battle of Trenzalore.

That would be very Moffatian.  They army the Doctor forms realizes after his fall the only way to potentially defeat the enemy is to assisted their leader before the battle forms.  At least try to assinate him in order to train him better for the battle to come.

Their first plan, The Pandorica opens would have prevented The Name of the Doctor.  The Pandorica would have kept the Doctor from dying.  The destruction of the Tardis would mean no tomb for GI to break into.  The whole universal destruction may have been an accident of the Silence not realizing an exploding Tardis does *that*.  After all, wouldn't many Tardises have exploded in the Time War?

Plan 2.0 from their perspective was Capturing the Doctor.  They try sealing him an enescapeable jail, just not as enescapeable as the Pandorica.  Again not killing him when they easilly could.

Plan 2.10 from the Silence's perspective seems less of a plan, but Melody going rogue and functioning off of her programming to kill the Doctor herself instead of letting him fall in battle.

Plan 2.2 was realizing that they could not stop the Doctor from dying.  No, to prevent him from dying on Trenzalore he must be killed on Earth in a fixed point.  That lone Silent we see?  Maybe the sudden idea of a Viking funeral with the supplies just happening to be there?  Destruction of the Doctor's body before it could convert to the time web form. 

The near complete vanishing after The Wedding of River Song was likely they thinking they succeeded or being unable to find the Doctor due to history wiping.  If they were truly villains they could have just taken the GI/Dalek route of kidnapping his friends.

Though interesting catch on the question at Eleven's fall and the silence might not have been what we were expecting.  Very clever.

Actually, maybe that is the ultimate plan of the Silence.  There was another way to save the Doctor.  Silence must fall because that other way happened last time and lead to the Doctor's defeat at Trenzalore.  Clara jumping in has changed time for a potential course where the Doctor doesnt fall on Tenzalore.

&gt;Yes, and that makes for a great episode, but as an introduction to a series that is primarily about the Doctor, an episode that barely features him at all is not one I would choose. It doesn't introduce you to the show as the tone and the lack of the Doctor is unique to the episode (that's part of what makes it so good, in my opinion). The episode itself is unique in Doctor Who and, as such, is not representative of the show in general as far as I am concerned.

&gt;It is a fantastic episode but it is not the one I would choose to show someone who knows nothing at all about the programme.

A little more: I think the main thing that keeps me coming back to Doctor Who is the Doctor himself.

true,free2bejc,1986,Gianfranco Zola,"In his first season he had the 4th most starts of any CM (45) but it was very close between him and Makélélè (46). Although when you factor in that he Makélélé was the Anchor whereas Lampard (61) and Essien (54) were where Ballack played he was a clear 3rd choice.

Mak started 42 of his 46. Ballack started 41 of his 45. Lampard started 57 of his 61 whilst Essien started 53 of his 54.

Now into his 2nd season. Here he had the 5th most appearances of any CM (30). He was once again behind Lampard and Essien in terms of starts. We played a triangle of CM's. One Anchor, One Ball Winner, One attacker/playmaker/Lampard-esque. Also Ballack struggled with fitness at the start of the season after an ankle surgery, this resulted in him not being in the Champions league squad. Sidwell was in the squad in his place.

In this season Lampard started 38, played 39. Essien started 39, played 45. Ballack started 25 and played 30. 

Now onto his 3rd Season. He had the 3rd most appearances of any CM (46) Starting 37. Lampard played 57 and started 56 of them. Ballack's starts are largely owing to Essien's longterm injury. In this season he was the Ball Winner of choice. (Mikel had 47 starts and 3 sub appearances if you're interested.)

In his last season, Ballack had the 2nd most appearances of any CM (44), behind Lamps (50). Ballack started 36 of these appearances. Lamps started 49 of his. Mikel 31 starts of his 34 apps.

Throughout his 1st season he was regularly on the bench. Same with the second season. In the 3rd he started more because Essien was injured. In 09-10 he started regularly too. So in summary, he was a sub in the first 2 seasons and was amazing back up for our best pair. In his 3rd and 4th season having such depth of quality in our squad was incredibly important to our team. Although, had Essien been as dominant as he was in Ballack's first 2 seasons then he probably would have been on the bench more.

The comment as Ballack a sub is simply to illustrate the fact that he was basically back-up. Great back up but back up none the less.

A good introductory episode not only introduces you to the characters and the world (which *Blink* does indeed do, much to its credit), but also to the general premise and format of the show.

This leads you to believe that the Doctor is a passerby who will be meeting new protagonists every episode, that the focus is less on the Doctor himself, but the path he leads. Yes, *Blink* does allude to the normal companion/Doctor dynamic with Martha's inclusions (most obviously, the ending ""three things and a lizard"" scene), but these take a backseat to Sally.

It's also relatively difficult to start someone out on what many consider to be ""the best"". If someone really, really liked *Blink*, that doesn't certify that they'll really like the rest of Doctor Who, simply because it's so different.

Not to say that one *couldn't* be introduced to Doctor Who through *blink*, only that it doesn't act like a particularly effective introduction to what the show actually is.

In my experience, *Blink* itself isn't an *introduction*, it's more of an *appetizer*, more of a hook to whet their appetite. 

*Blink* is just a small inticement to lure someone into the show, to pique their interest. You don't go from *Blink* straight onwards into *Utopia*/*The Sound of Drums*/*The Last of the Time Lords* for obvious reasons (seeing as a newcomer would be *very* confused by the sudden introductions of Saxon, The Fob Watch, Jack, etc.)

However, I have faith that in time BR will become the legendary manage we need; he's building something excellent and the psychiatry and medical staff he has implented is something I haven't heard of a manager doing before (though, admittedly I've only just recently begun to examine the inner workings of a club.) I can't imagine Mou having the patience FSG has - he's managed Chelsea, Inter, and Real Madrid. I'm not familiar enough with the Inter he inherited, but both Chelsea and Real will splash whatever amount needed to put together the squad Mou wants. Even if we're in the CL consistently in a few years time, I can't imagine FSG veering away from their ideology and so LFC will never (at least should never) hire a manager that has a big problem with this.

true,HarlawTheReader,eng-dorset,Dorset,"[This Live Science article](http://www.livescience.com/18132-intelligence-social-conservatism-racism.html) has a little bit on the methodology. From the piece:


&gt;The researchers turned to two studies of citizens in the United Kingdom, one that has followed babies since their births in March 1958, and another that did the same for babies born in April 1970. The children in the studies had their intelligence assessed at age 10 or 11; as adults ages 30 or 33, their levels of social conservatism and racism were measured.


&gt;In the first study, verbal and nonverbal intelligence was measured using tests that asked people to find similarities and differences between words, shapes and symbols. The second study measured cognitive abilities in four ways, including number recall, shape-drawing tasks, defining words and identifying patterns and similarities among words. Average IQ is set at 100.


&gt;Social conservatives were defined as people who agreed with a laundry list of statements such as ""Family life suffers if mum is working full-time,"" and ""Schools should teach children to obey authority."" Attitudes toward other races were captured by measuring agreement with statements such as ""I wouldn't mind working with people from other races."" (These questions measured overt prejudiced attitudes, but most people, no matter how egalitarian, do hold unconscious racial biases; Hodson's work can't speak to this ""underground"" racism.)

&gt;As suspected, low intelligence in childhood corresponded with racism in adulthood...

But it's good to remember that, as it states in lower down the page, the findings are correlative and not causative.",0,1369418640,null,0,false,0,ca59npd,t3_1eyv93,t1_ca59npd,t1_ca58v8m,null,1431045824,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,free2bejc,1986,Gianfranco Zola,"Funnily enough, I was just about to go through my past comments to go and add this point because I entirely see where you're coming from. It sounds as though I'm being pejorative towards Ballack. I didn't mean to, it is rather that our squad was so bloody impressive in CM at the time. We need that again. 

The point was not meant to be that Ballack was a second fiddle but rather that he was of such great calibre but spent many of his season as not being part of the preferred partnership. My point was meant to be that he was a great player and wasn't really the player in your first XI of the season. When you play a huge number of games I think it is usually best to have about 3 world class players in each position plus one youth player. An example of this would be playing a 4-4-2. You have 2 CB's playing every week. So you want 2 world class CB's, then, as you're playing every 3-5 days then you'll want a 3rd one as a rotation option. Then you'll want a youth player as back up. Following this idea, you're entirely right, Ballack was a first XI player but only every other week. Where the example of preference comes in is with the total number of performances. It is simply the case that when everybody is fit who do you want in that XI.

Ideally you'd have 22 first XI quality players and 3 youth players or something akin. My point was that when Ballack was our rotation option our squad was far better, in terms of depth of quality and general options. (By general options I mean the ability to play different formations with the players we have). Currently we lack general options as we don't have a winger and we don't have an out an out target man, although this summer could solve both of these. The squad has massive holes in it by comparison.

As for Marin being a back up player. He is exactly the kind of player we don't need or want. Similar to Benayoun. He gives you depth but he's not likely to get much better, challenge for a first XI spot or even be useful in the Champions league registrations. Those spots need to be given to young players.

Bercow was done, not for reporting that he was trending. She was done for saying she knew he was the paedophile in question.  Someone in her position may very well find out who it was, which is why a tweet from her would be read to mean that McAlpine was the paedophile. The same tweet from me for example would not mean the same thing unless there was some reason to believe I may be exposed to the answer.

I think she'd have won if she'd just said ""Lord McAlpine is trending on twitter, this is ominous"" or even just ""Lord McAlpine trending"". When she implied she knew why, it changed it completely.

As for people retweeting it, I don't think in any way shape or form would be a criminal offence.

I mean hey, if you like it then that's all good. I'm not bashing the whole show for it. But I was always uncomfortable with the idea of The Doctor falling in love with a companion. It seems like he really is beyond that.

BUT... I actually like to believe that he partially loved Rose but was more attached to her simply because she was his first companion after the Time War. So she was able to help rebuild him and give him back his ""humanity"". So much that he didn't bother to consider how much he damaged her mind and life when he let her come with him everywhere.

You see it in the later companions. He likes to weigh them down with stuff that reminds them of what they're leaving or have to live for beyond him so they actually make an educated choice to stay with him. Rose became addicted to him too quickly, the curse of the companion, and he did nothing to remedy the problem.

But having Rose after losing his people is what made him want to hold on to her a little more than he does with most companions. And then be able to leave his PTSD incarnation as 9 and regenerate into 10 with her by his side probably only strengthened that bond. So it only got harder to let her go to the point that maybe he did want to love her just to keep her and not lose someone again.

Ah I don't much mate, my opinion of most of the /r/UK membership is *far* too low to give a fuck if they can't take part in a discussion in good faith. Most people in this sub would far rather score a point than apply the [principle of charity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity) and attempt to improve their understanding and knowledge. As I said to someone else the other day, I've got 30,000 internet points, a few blue arrows makes no functional difference to my experience in here, as for people who post unintelligent things, I just ignore them these days, I really can't be bothered spending 5 hours giving someone a grounding in basic ethics just to show them why they're wrong about something. This place has now sunk to the level of the average UK voter.

&gt;It's a very complex issue, and this type of discussion is very interesting. It's a shame people are downvoting you for participating.

You'd be surprised how radically opposed people are to anyone who points out the fairly obvious truth that they oppose freedom of speech. There's a certain violence of feeling that comes about when you point out that a viewpoint which most people only think the bad guys adhere to is actually what they're fighting for.

This is my first football kit, so I don't have much to judge it off of, but it seems very well constructed, with no missing seams/loose threads anywhere. The Chelsea badge feels fucking robust, and is firmly sewed onto the shirt, as well as the Adidas logo. The iron-on numbers/EPL badges look good, except for one spot on Lampard's name where the shirt was folded that got a bit wrinkled. They look like they will be able to survive some decent abuse without peeling off, although I am wary about putting it in the laundry or trying to iron wrinkles out... anyone have some practical advice?

All in all, the thing fits great (I got a large, for my lanky 6'4"" frame), and is pretty comfortable. My only area of concern is the cuffs of the sleeves and the collar. Those cool looking striped parts are actually an elastic type of thing that i remember having on my little league baseball jerseys when i was a kid, and they itched like hell. These aren't as bad, and I'm hoping they will break in to feel silky smooth, but it is something to be aware of.
