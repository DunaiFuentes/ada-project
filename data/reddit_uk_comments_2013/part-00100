1. The Doctor has said that when The Master looked into the Untempered Schism, he went insane. The Doctor is then asked what happened to him when he looked into it. He said he ran away. He obviously saw himself in the future. But where and doing what?

2. He saw this mysterious Time Lord, the John Hurt character. I believe the John Hurt character is The Doctor ninth regeneration. At some point near the beginning of the Time War, he was forced to regenerate. When that happened, the Doctor underwent a personality change, like always. But, this Doctor was not like the others - he was a soldier and a leader of the Time Lords. 

The tenth doctor describes how the war started and what it turned into - ""hell"". This fits perfectly with the Devil language you have highlighted. If the Doctor called the Time War hell, certainly he was its greatest Devil. At some point near the end of the Time War, when the chaos and madness had reached the fever pitch described by Ten, the Doctor was forced to regenerate.

And the Tenth Doctor, Eccleston's doctor, was forced to confront what he had become. He could not reckon it and rationalize it. He saw himself as a monster and as Devil. Immediately, the Eccleston doctor - as he claims in the episode Dalek - burned the Daleks. But, I think he also burned the Time Lords. He destroyed everyone, weakening both sides. Then, with both forces beaten back, he time-locked them in 'Hell' forever. And he lived. And it all came true. So, what he spent his whole life running from, trying not to become, he ended up becoming.

Remember when Davros confronts the Doctor in the two-parter with the Dalek crucible? He is describing the John Hurt doctor.

""What I did, I did without choice. For peace and for sanity."" *These are the words of a soldier*.

Think back to the episode where they talked about the untempered schism.

Some men look into the time vortex and go mad.

Some men look into the time vortex and are inspired.

When the doctor looked into it... he ran, and he never stopped.

He was a boy looking into the fabric of space and time, and what he saw shocked and scared him so badly it redefined his life. What if he saw what he would become, what horrors he will wrought. A hole in time showing him his future creating a fixed point.

He dubs himself the doctor, to atone for the crimes he has yet to commit, but knows he will perform, because this is his fixed moment in time. And the act of knowing it and seeing the events occur regardless means he did not and could not stop it.

What he did in the great time war only scares him further as he saw in himself the traits necessary to become himself. So he runs further. Fixing the small things, secluding himself from companions because he doesnt just leave them because he hates goodbyes...

He leaves them before they see what he does and leave him in disgust.

Abandoning Susan was his way of keeping her from seeing what he will become.

I'm not super well versed in Dr. Who the way some people on this board are, but I always understood that the Doctor did something horrible (but necessary) during the Time War which resulted in the rest of his race dying.  I have also read speculation, like you said, that the 13 regenerations are imposed by the Time Lords themselves, and they don't allow anyone to regenerate after 13 times because at that point they are considered to be acting recklessly.  If that is the case, it makes me wonder, how could the Time Lords (who are dead from the Doctor's point of view) enforce this rule?  Then you get into a lot of convoluted discussion involving personal timelines etc.  I don't really know.  But when the Doctor talked about breaking the rules in the last episode; that he operated outside of the parameters he had adopted for ""The Doctor"" persona, it made me think for the first time that maybe he had killed off the Time Lords in his own future.  Perhaps he knows that it is going to happen, but he hasn't gotten there yet?  It is so hard to guess what is going to happen on this show. I don't know what to think about what went on in the Valeyard.  

Because of this subreddit, I am more or less convinced that River Song has something to do with the Great Intelligence (if they are not in fact the same entity?), and this last episode reinforced those beliefs.  I really don't know where this show is going right now, but there have been so many alternate futures in past seasons, that I can understand where you come from.   

Nothing in Dr. Who is written in stone, not even his own future.  Not even his own past apparently, as we just saw how Oswin was influencing it.  The overarcing storylines in this show always keep me guessing.  I can't wait to see David Tenant again in November.  Steven Moffat has really found a good balance with this season in my opinion.  Each episode can stand alone on its own, yet at the same time the overall story is slowly advanced each episode.

true,[deleted],null,null,"My theory:

From the Doctor's perspective, as Ten he hears from her *in* the Library that last thing she did before appearing *at* the Library was their date, so later he grows up to be Eleven and it comes time to go on the date (*Night and the Doctor*'s ""Last Night"") and he knows - even in the segment it's expressed in his face - that date is the last time he'll see her alive (as Eleven anyway) before she goes to the Library to die (which presumably she's unaware of because it was a split-second decision). 

So he tells her out of pity when she tries drawing it out of him (perhaps because she can read he's ""off"" worrying about her, and perhaps because they sexed or did something more intimate - ""There's only one time I could!""). Therefore the only reason he tells her is because he found out from her that he did. A self-closed causality loop?

Incidentally, when River whispers his name in his ear she prefaces it with an apology. Given that he says there's only one reason he'd ever tell anyone his name, I wonder if she's aware of the reason and knows it's something bad - so the apology covers the base of ""I'm going to tell you your name, sorry, I know that means I'm thusly telling you something bad is going to happen, but I need you to trust me, etc.""

true,CaerBannog,null,null,"&gt;the Doctor did something horrible (but necessary) during the Time War which resulted in the rest of his race dying. 

Yeah. But from what we know so far, they're not dead as such, they're locked off in a little time loop that can never rejoin our common universe's time line. And they're constantly experiencing the final moments of the Time War, dying and suffering over and over again for eternity in an infinite loop.

So .. yeah, I guess that's fairly bad :D 

But they still exist in some sense, so I hold out hope that the Time Lords will be brought back, because IMHO it was a stupid decision to get rid of them as they are a source of a lot of dramatic potential. I think The Doctor being on his own is a bit naff, and quite derivative, the Lone Warrior and all that.  

What I think they're now implying - and we'll find out in November - is that before locking them off in this time loop, The Doctor did something else which was even more horrible. /shrug

&gt;If that is the case, it makes me wonder, how could the Time Lords (who are dead from the Doctor's point of view) enforce this rule?

Well, this is why I say that the regeneration limit is gone, that now Gallifrey is locked off, the Time Lords can't artificially limit these regenerations. 

The *real* reason is, of course, that the BBC will continue to make Doctor Who for as long as it is profitable, and therefore the regeneration limit must be discarded. This seems to me to be the most reasonable way to explain it, but I'm not one of the writers, so we'll wait and see. I take the Sarah Jane Adventures comment as direct confirmation the producers already thought of all of this. 

&gt; it made me think for the first time that maybe he had killed off the Time Lords in his own future. Perhaps he knows that it is going to happen, but he hasn't gotten there yet?

Well, it has never been specifically stated, but the implication was always that Gallifrey existed in the past, one of the first advanced civilisations, but exerted influence throughout time. Either way, the result of the Great Time War is that Gallifrey and the Time Lords have been more or less erased from history at least from the 9th Doctor's incarnation on. 

So it hasn't happened in The Doctor's future, it is, relative to his regenerations, in the past, somewhere between the Paul McGann and Christopher Eccleston incarnations. The show gets quite simplistic when looking at temporal relativity, so I'm going to assume that for Earth it is the recent past as well. 

&gt;Perhaps he knows that it is going to happen, but he hasn't gotten there yet?

I don't think so. It definitely happened prior to the Eccleston incarnation. 

&gt;I am more or less convinced that River Song has something to do with the Great Intelligence

I'm not sure what to think about that. I don't do a lot of thinking about River Song as I am not a huge fan of the character. 

&gt;Steven Moffat has really found a good balance with this season in my opinion. Each episode can stand alone on its own, yet at the same time the overall story is slowly advanced each episode. Which is perfect, IMO.

I agree, but I wish they were longer. Episodes seem rushed. I do wish they would consider going to a longer format to allow for stories that didn't have to be sewn up within 45 minutes. I don't suppose they have much choice, and can't go back to the short episodic formats of the old days.

Also, it's less about making it work player-for-player, because as the article you linked said, we can; but it's about whether it's a coherent system.

To the best of my knowledge, Time Lords only have a certain amount of natural regenerations (12 or 13) before they die forever and the battle that created the graveyard seen in The Name Of The Doctor was never named. 

If John Hurt is the final Doctor, perhaps there is another war in the far future that is so horrible that the Doctor hides the fact that his future self created/caused/took part in it. After all, 9 made no secret of the fact that he wiped out the Time Lords, most of the Daleks &amp; untold billions more in the Last Great Time War. 

It makes little sense to me that he would hide the actions and identity of one regeneration while admit to the actions of another in the same war even though 9 using the Moment may have been in the ""name of the Doctor"". Wiping out ones species is pretty high on the list of horrible crimes. 

One theory though, and feel free to blow holes in it, is what if by his final regeneration the Doctor had grown sick of being alone &amp; found a way to unlock the Last Time War?

Your theory could still work, though if (say) after Hurt Doctor dies, the Time Lords grant him a full set of regenerations.

During Morbius and the Doctor's Mind Bending competition, there are 8 faces shown after showing faces for the 4th to the 1st.  After Mawdryn Undead (and others) established that the 1st Doctor really was the first, it was believed that these were actually earlier regenerations for Morbius.  Perhaps its the case that they were earlier Doctors before he took that title and that was given a new set of regenerations.

The war that created the graveyard was never named (from what I remember) and the Doctor &amp; Clara arrived at Trenzalore at an unspecified time. This could be a final war of sorts far in the future. 

As far as Hurt's Doctor doing whatever he did ""in the name of peace and sanity"", who said that it was peace &amp; sanity for others sake? What would be more out of character and unforgivable (to himself, and to others) than the Doctor giving in to guilt and loneliness at a point in the future and breaking the time lock on the war? And it is possible, Dalek Caan brought back Davros (although he went insane) and Rassilon sent back the White-Point Star to the Master, so time locks can be bent or broken.

The 9th, 10th &amp; 11th Doctors have always been portrayed as haunted, guilt ridden and lonely to varying degrees due to their actions in the War, what if it finally all catches up to him? Or he is manipulated in some way to bring the Time Lords back? 

I do realize this doesn't answer the question as to how 11 knows of Hurt's Doctor if he is indeed a future regeneration, but we've been thrown for loops by the writers before. I think this is a far more intriguing theory than a ""missing"" Doctor during the Time War. 

After all, 9, 10 &amp; 11 have all readily admitted to annihilating the Time Lords, Daleks &amp; countless others, but it was done ""in the name of the Doctor"" &amp; to save lives in the end.

If I were to take your advice, I'd try to pick up a world class center back like Mats Hummels or Sergio Ramos. Terry won't last forever, Luiz spends a lot of his time recently as a DM, and Ivanovich and Cahill are both solid but if the opportunity presented itself to improve on them, I'd take it.

In regards to a midfield anchor, I would promote from within (e.g. Ake) to add cover. 

Central and attacking midfield, with a combination of Lampard, Mata, Oscar, KDB, Marin, Ramirezs, etc., seems pretty set, in my opinion.

As far as wingers go, Hazard, KDB, Moses, and Bertrand would work but I wouldn't mind adding Andre Schurrle or someone like him who can play across the attacking line.

We could always use another striker, I suppose. Torres has improved greatly but, as with the defense, if the opportunity presented itself to add an improvement then I would take it. Ba hasn't been as productive as I would like, and Lukaku, despite his hat trick this weekend, might not be ready to lead the line on a regular basis for Chelsea.

If John Hurt is the last doctor, the doctor who ""was there when time ran out"", it isn't a stretch to assume that he used his TARDIS in the final moments to jump back into his own timeline in order to stay alive. Because of his guilt and fear at what he has become, he stays within the depths of the TARDIS, hiding from his current reincarnation. 

Furthermore, it makes sense that Matt Smith knows who John Hurt is and what he has done because, as your theory states, as a child, The Doctor witnessed his own future, his own fixed moment in time, by looking into the time vortex.

Terry isn't getting any younger or faster, and I don't know if I'd want to rely on Cahill/Luiz/Ivanovich all season. They're solid, but not world class. I'd want to bring in a player like Mats Hummels, Sergio Ramos, or even Raphael Varane to add some depth and class.

For central midfield, if we could pick up the next Makelele that would be great. I don't know who that would be, but I'm sure we could make some room for him.

In terms of striker, I don't know quite what to do. I imagine that Lukaku will be going back out on loan (possibly to Swansea because they're in Europe next season), so that would just leave us with Torres and Ba. We managed to get by this season because the midfield supplied a huge amount of goals, but to mount a true challenge on the title, I feel like we need a consistent and clinical finisher up front. With proper rotation, a new striker/Torres/Ba could be enough to see us through.

Finally, I'd want to have a look at the players we have out on loan and try to integrate them into the setup a bit more. Lukaku and Courtois should stay out on loan to continue their development, but I think players like Kevin de Bruyne should be here in the squad, perhaps at the expense of players like Yossi Benayoun and Florent Malouda.

true,Spartan144,smith,Smith,"Wow you put a lot of work into this. Very nice post with some good evidence to back it up. I am with you all the way until you say Hunt is before the first Doctor. As others have pointed out, the Doctor says Hunt broke his promise. You have to make a promise in order to break it. Then the Doctor and Hunt have this little exchange.

Hunt: ""What I did I did without choice.""

The Doctor: ""I know.""

Hunt: ""In the name of peace and sanity."" 

The Doctor: ""But not in the name of the Doctor.""

So Hunt wasn't pure evil. He did something that was necessary but not in line with the values of the Doctor. This fits nicely with the Doctor committing genocide to stop the Time War. The Time War was a catastrophic event that was going to destroy the universe. The Time Lords were preparing their final plan to destroy time itself. So ""in the name of peace and sanity"" Hunt used the moment to end the Time War and committed genocide on 2 races. 

The paralleled between the Doctor and the Devil are undeniable, but I doubt they are meant to be taken so literally that the Doctor is the Devil. The Doctor is without a doubt the most powerful entity within the Who-universe. I think where Moffat is going with this is that that much power held by anyone, no matter their good intentions, is to much to handle. Mistakes are going to be made and when they are on that big a scale millions of lives are lost. Something along the lines of ""Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely.""

EDIT:: Something else I thought about. At the end of series 1 Eccleston is given the choice to becoming ""the great exterminator"" (by destroying all life on earth and the remaining Daleks), but doesn't because he refuses to have all that blood on his hands. Very interesting considering we know the Doctor ends the Time War by committing genocide on his own people and attempting to kill the Daleks. This shows that whichever incarnation ended the Time War could not have been ""the Doctor."" The Doctor would chose coward over killer ""every time"" according to 9.

So there is enough evidence that Hartnell's Doctor was the first and Hurt's comes later.  During the Time War is most likely.

It's also important to note that the people calling the Doctor all of these names are generally bad guys that he has stopped from doing bad things at one point or another.  Davros blaming the Doctor for killing the Daleks when they were actively trying to end reality and kill every living being in the universe for instance.  Some slight bias there.

All of the instances you correctly found of the Doctor being compared to the devil could be how he thinks of himself.  Someone who values all life as much as the Doctor does is going to feel guilt when he is responsible for any deaths.  Even if they are the bad guys.  And he has destroyed a lot of bad guys and been unable to save many innocent people in his long life.

It was also shown what what the consequences of there being no Doctor throughout time would be.  All the worlds and people he had saved winking out of existence.

First, we don't know if Hurt ended the war, all we can gather (assuming he was from the war) is that Hurt did horrible things in the Time War that Doctor wouldn't consider Doctor-Name-Worthy. 

So when 10 said, he ended the war to stop the Time Lords from destroying the universe, he may in fact not be talking about John Hurt, but Eccleston's. Meaning after John Hurt did all his horrible things (which ties to the 50th some how) he then died, and became Eccleston, who later actually ended the war.

I like this, because it adds to the theory that the Dream Lord is actually the Valeyard, since the Valeyard is the ""personified dark side of the Doctor, created during his Twelfth regeneration"". Since Hurt being Doctor 9, bumping 11 up to doctor 12, that points to the Dream Lord being said Valeyard. And honestly, how awesome would it be to see more Toby Jones in this show?

Lastly, Hurt can't be the original Doctor, since as 11 put it, a name is a promise, and Hurt broke that promise.

If I understand where you are coming from, I think you are assuming the tardis facilitated Clara's travel through the doctors past, like some opening into the time vortex in the tardis itself allowed that event to occur.

And as a result I think you are assuming that you saw the events that unfolded at the end with the two doctors and Clara as events that took place on the tardis, or within it.

I think the doctor was speaking the truth, the light structure we saw was his remains, and by entering them, whoever did so was catapulted through his timeline at each moment he time traveled, able to distort his history.

What we witnessed at the end was what remained of Clara being deposited in a form of temporal limbo once she had lived her thousands of lifetimes in the doctors time streams and been deposited there in the remnants of the doctors history.

I don't think the events we witnessed once in the remains took place in the tardis but more in some form of metaphorical pocket dimension outside of space time.

I think the John hurt doctor was the doctor to come, whether the next regeneration, or future ones to come, and because Clara entered the remains of the doctor at the end of his journey she could see all his old incarnations and bear witness to the new one. The question being why then did she not get to see the timeline of the new doctor, would be something to discuss.

As for how the doctor dies, that battle sounds epic, but was also described as minor by the great intelligence. Who knows how he died, or even if we will ever see that unfold.

Do you not realise how flawed this logic is?

Whether they buy drugs from a dealer or from a pharmacy it still costs them money.

If they don't have that money but they still need the drugs where do you think they're going to get the money from? By committing crime, just like they do now.

Unless you give drugs out for free (which is a fucking ludicrous idea) then you'll still have the issue of people stealing shit to pay for drugs.

The reason we can't, and shouldn't, deport him is because human rights are for EVERYONE. Do you really wish to set a precedent that a man deemed 'undesirable' by Government can have his human rights violated with no protection?

&gt;The ECHR is broken, it doesn't work. It needs changing and quite frankly I hope we leave it. 

Which ECHR are you talking about? The convention or the court? The convention certainly does work. It's brought a focus onto human rights that has never before been seen in Europe. Wanting to withdraw from the convention is absolutely ludicrous. If you're going to say the Court doesn't work you'll need to provide some evidence. 

Recently, in the case of Animal Defenders International, the European Court of Human Rights ruled paid political adverts could not be aired in the UK. This is opposite to what the US courts found (in the famous 'corporations are people' verdict), and that decision has been almost universally maligned in America. It stops corporations from buying adverts on political issues and essentially releasing propaganda. Our own courts ruled to overturn this ban, but the ECofHR upheld it. A just ruling, wouldn't you agree?

Honestly I think you have no actual knowledge of the subject except for the populist nonsense papers like the Daily Mail print. You actually make a point to say that we should withdraw from the only thing protecting human rights in the UK just to get rid of one man. Also, in May last year the ECofHR denied Qatada leave to appeal against a new order for deportion after new evidence came up. So you're getting yourself into a frenzy and wishing us to abandon all human rights protection in this country to deport a man WHO IT HAS ALREADY BEEN RULED CAN BE DEPORTED. It was one of our own, British tribunals that denied the deportation order.


You say its for the protection from terrorism. This is another thing threat that has been overstated in order to justify limiting of our rights. Have you heard of terrorist control orders? Currently there are only 8 people under these. Just 8. Originally, the Government wanted the powers to indefinitely detain people. So it wished to violate every principal of justice just so it could deal with 8 people slightly easier.

You don't walk on the roads or at 30mph.

&gt; figures that put the blame of cycling/driving collision at the foot of the driver (67%) it's clear that licensing for cyclists is something of a non issue.

I wouldn't say that the cause of a third of accidents is a non-issue at all. If a stat came out that a third of accidents were caused by drink driving it would be considered an epidemic. 

I'm not laying the blame solely at the cyclists, I just don't think they're blameless, and whilst driving lessons and tests teach to how to avoid accidents with cyclists, cyclists have no such training. 

Theoretically, someone could come to this country with no knowledge of our road system and ride a bike on a busy road. I can't be the only one who worries about this. A CBT style thing for cyclists shouldn't be that difficult, they could even teach it as part of PE, thus making it free for all kids and ensuring they have it before they hit adulthood.

Why insist something that's already not legally required?

Sure, but please consider the fact that cars kill 1000s and cyclists kill 1-2 per year. It's not fair to assume a law broken by a cyclist if the same as as law broken by a car.

&gt;I wouldn't say that the cause of a third of accidents is a non-issue at all. If a stat came out that a third of accidents were caused by drink driving it would be considered an epidemic.

And 2/3 of accidents caused by cars is more of an epidemic?


&gt;and whilst driving lessons and tests teach to how to avoid accidents with cyclists, cyclists have no such training.

80% of cyclists (who are of a car driving age) own a driving license. So...the issue is education all round.

And clearly, a license didn't stop the driver driving away in this case.

Nope, this is not quite true.  

For the most part, the two are legally identical; you should get the same next-of-kin rights, inheritance tax breaks, even parental rights, but [despite some reporting](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18407568), there are actually a few differences.  The one I see most commonly mentioned (e.g. [in this article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/17/gay-marriage-civil-partnerships)) is that civil partners of peers or knights do not get a matching spousal title in the way that married partners do. Marriages also require consummation and thus can be dissolved rather than divorced in the case of adultery or lack of consummation. I imagine this is mostly due to the difficulty in defining consummation in a simple way with same-sex relationships!

The other issues are more related around the problem of having two distinct concepts, rather than the definition of civil partnership itself.  [This article](http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/seven-ways-civil-partnership-isnt-same-marriage250113) summarises a few of them, the most relevant probably being:

* some other countries (even those where same-sex marriage is legal!) do not recognise civil partnership as same-sex marriage.  The two are treated differently which means that civilly partnered couples will not have the same rights as same-sex married partners would in foreign countries, even though they are (mostly) equal in ours.

* no provision for transgender couples; if one half of a 'straight' relationship transitions to a different sex, they will need to divorce and to civilly partner instead.  Not only is this expensive and inconvenient, it will also have knock-on effects for anything like pension benefits which are calculated based on the length of your legal relationship.  (This is also why civil partners are at a disadvantage compared to married partners, by definition their legal relationship cannot be older than 2004.  There isn't really a sensible way around this though, so I think it disingenuous to call it a disadvantage of civil partnerships.)

* keeping the two options separate also indirectly outs your sexuality (bisexuals notwithstanding etc) on any legal form.  Given that there are laws protecting asking for someone's sexuality, but not asking for their marital status, this seems problematic.  

...that's enough words for this point on a Tuesday morning.  I just thought I'd jump in and cover one aspect, I'm not exactly clear on the ramifications of the change as far as the bill is concerned, though I am in favour of opening up civil partnerships too if they are going to remain.",0,1369124813,null,0,false,0,ca2x63s,t3_1epyui,t1_ca2x63s,t3_1epyui,null,1431086427,13,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,13

That was two sentences of my post, though I admit it was out of line. It's just that you seem to be using similar techniques to those used by those newspapers to prove your point. 

&gt;Answer ONE QUESTION for me, do you honestly believe we should keep a man in this country who wants to kill its citizens? Do you honestly think we owe it too 'our mate Abu' to protect him from whatever another country wants to do to him? (baring in mind he is NOT a British citizen). 

I believe if there is a legal way to remove him from the country then that should happen. However, I also believe that human rights are for all, not just those who the state thinks deserves them. If you start to take away the rights of those who are deemed unworthy of them then human rights essentially become worthless. I don't give a shit about Qatada, I don't give a shit if he gets tortured, but circumventing human rights to deal with a single person is something that I'm very uneasy with. It sets a terrible precedent.

&gt;but because you genuinely believe we need to be under a European Court for all of us to have human rights, then WHY CANT WE WRITE OUR OWN? That favour BRITISH CITIZENS? Are we incapable of doing this? Do we need to rely on a European system because the mainland Europeans are smarter than us and more capable? And if so why?

The point of the Convention (which isn't related to the EU) is to formulate human rights that are universal across Europe. It was created after WW2 to make sure those atrocities would never be seen in Europe again. When we signed it into law with the Human Rights Act 1998 we chose what rights we wished to give direct effect to in UK law. We excluded the ones we didn't agree with, and we adopted the ones we did agree with. So it is as British as it is European. The European Convention set out an extensive list of rights, and we cherry-picked the ones we wished to adhere to. We gave a right of appeal to the court in Strasbourg because it was believed that court was in a better position to protect these rights than our domestic courts in those exceptional cases where a case will be heard there. The European Court of Human Rights doesn't hear many cases at all. A case will only go there when the British courts are unsure of or unable to apply the law, and wish for the issue to be clarified in Strasbourg.

The whole point of human rights is that they can't favour 'British citizens'. They're called 'human rights' because they apply to everyone, though some can be limited.

Apart from the Human Rights Act there is no statutory protection of human rights in the UK. Do you understand why I'm so hostile to anyone wishing to withdraw from the convention now? They're wishing to throw away the only thing protecting us from further undue Government interference. Government has already shown with terrorist control measures that it's willing to circumvent the rule of law when it wishes to.

&gt;When it takes us 10years for us to deport a man filled with hate (cant use 'terrorist' because he hasnt been charged - because we want him out) because foreign nations rule we can't, do you not think something is wrong with that system?

No, as I said before I believe human rights shouldn't be waived just because in certain circumstances it may seem just to do so. What is 'just' is entirely subjective and I'm in favour of hard, objective measures to protect our fundamental rights.",0,1369125557,null,0,1369125749,0,ca2x9fb,t3_1eokd6,t1_ca2x9fb,t1_ca2x58r,null,1431086384,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

All methadone does is maintain an addict, that's why they call it 'methadone maintenance', most users have it as a buffer for when they run out of gear and don't want to face the shit storm of opiate withdrawal. 

Much better to give them medically pure heroin (to save them injecting heroin bulked up with brick dust) and using all of the money fighting a war which does not work towards profession rehabilitation. 

EDIT: Just wanted to add that methadone detoxes are also much more horrible then an opiate detox.

Secondly there is already illegal widespread distribution which is only growing even in the fact of ever growing government attempts at intervention. So making it legal is unlikely to actually drive consumption past a point that it's climbing towards anyway.

Keeping it illegal only result in more and more people who are going to be criminalised for something they are simply going to do regardless so it's best for everyone to accept that the issues that result are really public health not criminal. This both means we can regulate and make safer the drugs people take, tax them and remove a major source of income from criminal gangs and likely hugely reduce overall levels of actually serious criminality as a result. 

If someone wants to throw their life away and cause themselves tremendous physiological and physical harm by consuming alcohol we simply accept that as part of our social system and expect our health services to take care of them but when it comes to drugs that are increasingly been shown to be less harmful and destructive we'll instead slap the same kind of people with criminal charges and further drive them into a cycle of abuse.

I'm really not sure you've thought this through. The vast majority of people will still want a car, driverless or not. People want their own space, the cars will not just drive around waiting for a call that's ineffecient so they'll sit and wait somewhere. If you live out in the country you're going to find yourself waiting a long time for a public driverless car.

&gt; FAR few cars on the road. Parking problems eliminated. Car parks turned into homes, shops or green spaces.

I doubt it, if taking a driverless car is cheap then there will be less inclination to use buses and trains after all why ride with everyone else when you can have your own pod. People still wont share with other people. You still need sufficient vehicles and distribution to cope with peak traffic. The number of vehicles on the road at any one time is unlikely to be different. While car parks will be more efficient they'll still have to reside somewhere.

I think a world full of driverless cars is far further off than reddit thinks it is. The transition period from a driving to a driverless one will be enourmous. I do see driverless cars as part of a dreary anodyne future but fortunately I doubt I'll be around to see it.

However, I believe that the increase in shared use pavements, gutter hugging and door zone skimming cycle lanes and general cycle facility wankery, generate the impression that riding like any other vehicle is inherently dangerous and that there is a an obscure and special set of rules and exceptions that only apply to cyclists and that these rules should be used to minimize the time cyclists spend on any piece of tarmac that may be used by traffic.

These impressions are wrong and dangerous and lead cyclists to behave in an unpredictable and dangerous manner.

It takes the mind of a stubborn, big headed old git to ride in a predictable manner just like any other vehicle. This is called Vehicular Cycling and is widely mocked amongst the proponents of separate cycling facilities. It is however widely practiced amongst old cyclist.

I generally have been carrying a 0% balance for about 3 years now in one form or another (currently have wife's engagement ring on a 0% loan which is 2 months short of being paid off - and the last of my student debt on 0% card). My experience is that it's not negative as my credit rating is very decent.

I've never been declined for anything, including a premium miles card recently. Then again it could be that I have joint finances with the missus, never missed payments, never had too much debt etc. I wasn't particularly financially responsible as a student, but I've learned a huge amount over the past 3-4 years. It's amazing how quickly you can build a very strong credit report.

There are some pretty good 20 month+ 0% deals out there, and it could spread the cost of your new car better rather than only until next March, and if something does come up you need the credit for you can always pay it off. Then again you would have to apply for a different card(which will have an effect on your credit file - so think carefully).

um......probably wrong.

When a person from Gallifrey graduates from Time Lord Academy and become a Time Lord they most likely choose a name. The Doctor, The Master, the War Lord, the Monk are all known time lords who were known by other names (birth names) while going to school with the Doctor. 

Also you have to remember that in Satan's pit, The Doctor isn't completely convinced that he is actually devil, and conversely stated that he didn't believe in any gods but has met many beings who claimed they were. 

And you have to remember, England isn't exactly Texas; that is to say they aren't a devoutly religious society that would say The Doctor who has been on tv for 50 years in their country is really the Devil..

true,therealhatman,tennant,Tennant,"I feel like there's a bit of a hole in everybody's theories towards both an unregenerated Doctor and an extra regeneration between the eighth and ninth Doctor. In ""Nightmare in Silver,"" the Cyberplanner, Mr. Clever, points out that ""we've had some cowboys in here. Ten complete rejigs.""

Now, I know that there's a good percent of the mind Mr. Clever didn't have access to, but he tells the Doctor earlier that he can recreate the Doctor's past from the hole he's left in the data steam when he deleted himself. I think if there was an entire regeneration that the Doctor covered up or that the Cyberplanner couldn't gain access to because of the struggle, the planner could still get enough of an idea from the hole left over that there was another regeneration that the Doctor hid.

It's just a theory hinging on a few lines of dialog in an episode written by somebody usually not at the writer's table for the show, but you'd think if Moffat was about to reveal a secret regeneration he'd foreshadow it a bit more, right? I mean, you say the number eleven instead of ten nobody questions it much, we are on the eleventh Doctor after all. But if people do look into that, Moffat freaking LOVES seeing his fans try to figure stuff out. God love him, but I swear he keeps delaying Sherlock because he's having too much fun watching the internet lose its collective damn mind over trying to figure out the last few minutes of the last episode.

So, this little novella I've written at ""Damn, I should be asleep"" o'clock is why I think Hurt is playing a new interpretation of the eighth Doctor. An older one, from after the movie but before we see him in London with Rose as the ninth. We have so little from him and from what I understand, never having seen the movie myself but hearing a bit from disappointed friends, there's a bit we could gain from some stuff being shifted around in his run. John Hurt as an older version of the eighth Doctor's not just a great chance to fix any issues people had with things done in the movie, but also help clarify some of the retcons done between classic and modern Doctor Who.

Dearest creature in creation,
Study English pronunciation.
I will teach you in my verse
Sounds like corpse, corps, horse, and worse.
I will keep you, Suzy, busy,
Make your head with heat grow dizzy.
Tear in eye, your dress will tear.
So shall I! Oh hear my prayer.
Just compare heart, beard, and heard,
Dies and diet, lord and word,
Sword and sward, retain and Britain.
(Mind the latter, how it’s written.)
Now I surely will not plague you
With such words as plaque and ague.
But be careful how you speak:
Say break and steak, but bleak and streak;
Cloven, oven, how and low,
Script, receipt, show, poem, and toe.
Hear me say, devoid of trickery,
Daughter, laughter, and Terpsichore,
Typhoid, measles, topsails, aisles,
Exiles, similes, and reviles;
Scholar, vicar, and cigar,
Solar, mica, war and far;
One, anemone, Balmoral,
Kitchen, lichen, laundry, laurel;
Gertrude, German, wind and mind,
Scene, Melpomene, mankind.
Billet does not rhyme with ballet,
Bouquet, wallet, mallet, chalet.
Blood and flood are not like food,
Nor is mould like should and would.
Viscous, viscount, load and broad,
Toward, to forward, to reward.
And your pronunciation’s OK
When you correctly say croquet,
Rounded, wounded, grieve and sieve,
Friend and fiend, alive and live.
Ivy, privy, famous; clamour
And enamour rhyme with hammer.
River, rival, tomb, bomb, comb,
Doll and roll and some and home.
Stranger does not rhyme with anger,
Neither does devour with clangour.
Souls but foul, haunt but aunt,
Font, front, wont, want, grand, and grant,
Shoes, goes, does. Now first say finger,
And then singer, ginger, linger,
Real, zeal, mauve, gauze, gouge and gauge,
Marriage, foliage, mirage, and age.
Query does not rhyme with very,
Nor does fury sound like bury.
Dost, lost, post and doth, cloth, loth.
Job, nob, bosom, transom, oath.
Though the differences seem little,
We say actual but victual.
Refer does not rhyme with deafer.
Fe0ffer does, and zephyr, heifer.
Mint, pint, senate and sedate;
Dull, bull, and George ate late.
Scenic, Arabic, Pacific,
Science, conscience, scientific.
Liberty, library, heave and heaven,
Rachel, ache, moustache, eleven.
We say hallowed, but allowed,
People, leopard, towed, but vowed.
Mark the differences, moreover,
Between mover, cover, clover;
Leeches, breeches, wise, precise,
Chalice, but police and lice;
Camel, constable, unstable,
Principle, disciple, label.
Petal, panel, and canal,
Wait, surprise, plait, promise, pal.
Worm and storm, chaise, chaos, chair,
Senator, spectator, mayor.
Tour, but our and succour, four.
Gas, alas, and Arkansas.
Sea, idea, Korea, area,
Psalm, Maria, but malaria.
Youth, south, southern, cleanse and clean.
Doctrine, turpentine, marine.
Compare alien with Italian,
Dandelion and battalion.
Sally with ally, yea, ye,
Eye, I, ay, aye, whey, and key.
Say aver, but ever, fever,
Neither, leisure, skein, deceiver.
Heron, granary, canary.
Crevice and device and aerie.
Face, but preface, not efface.
Phlegm, phlegmatic, ass, glass, bass.
Large, but target, gin, give, verging,
Ought, out, joust and scour, scourging.
Ear, but earn and wear and tear
Do not rhyme with here but ere.
Seven is right, but so is even,
Hyphen, roughen, nephew Stephen,
Monkey, donkey, Turk and jerk,
Ask, grasp, wasp, and cork and work.
Pronunciation (think of Psyche!)
Is a paling stout and spikey?
Won’t it make you lose your wits,
Writing groats and saying grits?
It’s a dark abyss or tunnel:
Strewn with stones, stowed, solace, gunwale,
Islington and Isle of Wight,
Housewife, verdict and indict.
Finally, which rhymes with enough,
Though, through, plough, or dough, or cough?
Hiccough has the sound of cup.

There could be a variety of reasons for such couples to make this choice. Here is one scenario:

Dissenters to the redefining of marriage could decide that, in order to avoid raising their children in conformity with the state-defined institution that it now calls ""marriage"" they would seek alternative forms of public ceremonies to affirm their lifelong commitment to each other.  These events could avoid the term ""marriage"" and might be called by such names as ""union"", ""covenant"", etc. They may then choose to raise their children with an understanding of that arrangement, without references to the newly-defined institution of ""marriage."" 

Such ceremonies of course would have no legal basis, but as citizens, such dissenting couples ought to be able to form a legal agreement to establish basic mutual rights. A civil partnership would appear to be the obvious legal device or doing this.

Any sort of business which deals in actual, physical things will often need to ship them (or bits of them) about the place, and unless you're a wholesaler working with huge volumes, you need to use either Royal Mail or a private courier. 

Now half the problem of privatising Royal Mail is that it, like BT, Gas, Electricity, and water, it's a ""natural monopoly""(1). A natural monopoly is a business sector in which the only way to provide a good service is to have such a large amount of infrastructure that the bigger the corporation, the more successful it is. Partial coverage is no good, so the industry by it's nature excludes small, competitive newcomers. Because of this, the industry naturally tends towards a monopoly or near monopoly situation with a few giant companies. 

What will happen if/when they privatise RM then is that in 10 years we'll see the same situation we have at present in the energy and water sectors (all natural monopolies) - a few massive corporations colluding to keep prices artificially high. 

But the MPs who'll land cushy jobs on the RM board and invest heavily in their stock don't give a shit about that.

true,lionmoose,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,"&gt; How many hundreds of post offices do you think there are in the UK? How many thousands of vans and lorries? How many tens of thousands of postmen and sorters? 

That's company capital rather than infrastructure. You can't share a gas main effectively because of geographic constraints, not because it's expensive. There is no such constraint on post delivery- the only shared infrastructure is road-space. Also, supermarkets have equally complicated supply chains, and yet they compete with each other. Further, there are small shops performing exactly the same function. This is the antithisis of a monopoly.

&gt; It can't perform it's function without a vast and all encompassing infrastructure. It needs depots and sorting offices and fleets of vehicles all over the nation. If I wanted to start my own postal company, I'd need hundreds of millions of pounds to invest, I'd need to copy that infrastructure just to be competitive.

A national level company would. However, there is no reason why start up companies could not operate in, say, one big city. The entry costs there would be relatively low. If you wanted to enter the market (monopolies are characterised by the fact that it is difficult for new entrants to provide competition) you would start small and expand, like any other company. I don't see any tendancy to the entirety of the postal network being concentrated in one provider. 


&gt; No private courier company provides quite the same service that the Post Office does.

Deutsche Post provides exactly the service that Royal Mail does, across a number of countries and is privately owned. 

&gt; I'm not saying that private companies can't provide the same service, but I do think they won't provide any sort of cheap alternative.

I think a lot of the idea of mail being a natural monopoly is that it's currently organised as a monopoly. The fact that parcel mail now allows competition is convincing enough to me that the entire postal system could be private. The question is I suppose whether you would want that to happen- the market clearing price for delivering a letter in a rural area would probably increase. Whether you want that to happen politically is a different question. However, the one thing is that it is not that difficult to enter the postal market, which really moves us away from the idea of monopoly.

And, I mean, I'm personally okay with it but it doesn't fit Skyrim at all.  Especially lore-wise.

On the other hand, though, mine was originally a sort of factory-style, TARDIS control room shaped ""dwemer"" version.  Wood burning stove thing instead of a time rotor... etc.  Yours looks (to me) more like some kind of astral plane... thing, which doesn't necessarily fit the style of the Skyrim *dwemer ruins*, but I think works pretty well in execution (especially given the backstory of the dwemer).  Have you considered (or maybe you already did it, I dunno) having different rooms be wall-less platforms in the same cell, kind of far apart, and link them via separate standing doors (think a door that doesn't look like it goes anywhere because it's just a door and frame)

It's just a suggestion, obviously; I don't want to imply you should definitely go with it.

My point was that when talking about how much economic pressure can be applied via tax in a legal regulated market you have to take into account it both being legal and regulated as adding value. 

People find ways around the high prices on alcohol and tobacco, some of which are illegal, but by and large most people choose to buy legally because it easier and less risky.

On top of that once legal systems are in place and a large number of people start using them the black market falls apart. It may still exist but it's prices would likely not remain as cheap as they are today because you'd be facing the risks of producing unregulated pot for a vastly reduced market for the product. The USA was able to reintroduce taxes on alcohol once prohibition was over regardless of how strong the black market was during that prohibition. 

Legal pot in short holds more economic value than illegal pot and the price of illegal pot would inherently have to rise due to it's markets being undermined by any act of legalisation. I'd actually suggest upping the charges for illegal producing of any drugs we legalise because once you have a legal alternative illegal sources lose their leverage which currently makes harsher laws impotent.

And that is what exactly? We've been drinking alcohol longer than we've been writing things down and we seem to be doing fine for the most part.

&gt; People continue to commit murder even though it's illegal… Should we legalise that too? Of course not! So, the ""people will do it anyway"" arguement doesn't work.

Yes lets compare the freedom of a person to their person with the freedom of a person to take someones elses life. That really makes your point look incredibly logical and well thought out.

Yes we make things illegal if we feel committing those act require punishment. This is largely used to address issues of doing harm to a 3rd party. In terms of murder most of us are not not going around murdering people because we are afraid of being punished but because it's an awful thing to do. We make it illegal so we have a legal framework in which to prevent it if we can or to deal with the person who did it if not. In other words we don't make murder illegal because we expect it stop people committing murder because the people who are going to do that won't care, we do it for the rest of us to have recourse and and expectation of protection from those people. 

In terms of social norms and personal freedoms what society deems acceptable inherently runs *ahead* of laws because laws are static. When large parts of society are ignoring laws then it comes time to review the need and reasoning for those laws. We've got an example of exactly that happening with the gay marriage bill which is the law in a long line of laws change to reflect the new social norms regarding homsexuality. Should we allow murder simply because we allow gay marriage? Because that is exactly the logic you just used.

Let take anti circumvention laws in regards to copyright. It can be technically illegal for you to copy the contents of a cd you own on to your PC (something you are otherwise legally allowed to do) if you have to circumvent a digital lock. People widely ignored this because they felt their personal right to do what they can legally do with the content outweighs it and both here and the US these kind of laws are facing review and change. Should we allow murder because we are going to change anti circumvention laws? 

Which all begs the question do you not murder people just because it's illegal? 'cus that's kinda scary.

&gt;So lets look at what happens in other countries, such as the US, first. Let them take the ""experiment"" and learn from their results.

We have lots of examples of counties in which they've already largely had versions of decriminalisation and it's largely been positive. Should we carry on criminalising young people taking substances that are largely seen as relatively safe? 

How long a period would America have to have had for you to be satisfied that it was the right thing to do? Your own point is that you feel we can't know the long term impacts but we are already seeing the long term impact of prohibition and they are really sucky.

&gt;Depends how you define ""prohibition""… There are plenty of examples of harmful things being banned and their use going to practically zero...

I'm using in directly in the context of drugs but I'd like you to list the examples you have in mind please.

true,ElDingus,num30,Sandro,"I think you're incredibly optimistic, though I don't blame you for being so.  We should in theory have a very capable squad, though I still am not comfortable with our lack of depth.  We had no coverage on the wings, Parker was a serious step down from what Sandro had been doing, and when Dembele was out, we had no suitable coverage in Huddlestone.  Obviously we need someone that will finally provide goals for us, but we had injuries this season that we couldn't always recover from with their replacements.  I think we need someone who can play similarly to Dembele since he likely would need rest, and could obviously become injured.  I think if we went through a season without injury, then yes we certainly could be challenging for the top 1-3 spots, but that isn't a reality.  Our scouting could be better honestly.  Rather than going for an established player like Moutinho again (which I don't think we will), I would prefer we pick up someone with a similar skill-set, just with a lower price, and less competition.  

I also think we still have a bit of an issue with our squad mentality.  We don't have that mental strength and confidence that a squad like Man United have.  Granted, they have had huge successes and stability that we haven't had, but I personally think there is just something about the squad that doesn't seem like they all believe they could be challenging for a title.  When we needed a goal or went up, we often went in a lull with little focus, which ultimately cost us a few points here and there.  I think a lot of that is from having little stability in our management, and for having people like Redknapp around who didn't focus himself at times.  Luckily, I think we have someone that could seriously change that around in AvB.  His tactics are good obviously, but his attitude is something that has really set him apart in my mind.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"I wouldn't say it is impossible, we certainly have a quality squad returning that can really do some damage in the league.  We desperately need a striker (realistically we need 2 quality strikers) and we can use some help with depth on the wings and maybe high end creative midfielder.  LB coverage wouldn't hurt depending on what AVB's opinion of Rose actually is.

But to say 5 wins from a striker (i agree with this by the way) puts us in contention for the title assumes that none of the other squads do anything in the summer to address their needs.

There are 4 other teams ahead of us who are really high end squads. Now 3 of those teams are changing coaches and there will be a adjustment period to the squads and coaches, this can dramatically impact how these teams perform at least in the beginning of the season.

Make no mistake Man U is going to do what they can to help Moyes get what he deems nessasary to be successful.  They will open the strings on a sizeable purse and go chase who he wants i would be completely unsurprised to see ManU close out summer with a striker like Lewandowski along with Baines and Fellanini and possibly a CM. They are already a stacked lineup, even if they were to lose Rooney they have no shortage of strikers and no shortage of money to get a replacement.  The biggest challenge for them will be how quickly Moyes integrates with the squad. Sadly even with SAF retiring they are still going to be among the favorites to win the league.

Chelsea will absolutely spend for Jose.  Love him or hate him he is an unbelievably good coach and Roman will spare no expense for him. I imagine they will splash cash for whatever Jose wants, a high end striker, midfielder, defenders.  He will get what he wants and the man can coach. If Chelsea did absolutely nothing other than sign Jose most people would put them in the chase for the title, but they will do more than get just Jose and will be in the top group.

Man City. Personally i am not a fan of Pelligrini but they are another team that will spend for the new coach. New striker, new midfielder or 2, new defender or 2 all doable and well within their means to go get all of them to add to a fairly stacked squad.

Arsenal, look we all hate them but we have to give credit where it is due now and then.  Wenger (who i loathe) is a fucking top quality coach who will keep them in contention for a CL birth.  There are already rumors that he has been given a 70m kitty for transfers, somehow i doubt that is the actual figure but if they actually spend (which i kinda doubt they will to the extent the press clippings) and with new managers in 3 of the title contenders they can certainly put their hat in the ring.

Thats just the top 4 teams.  Keep in mind Liverpool actually stabilized under Rodgers down the stretch and will spend money to shore up the team They will be looking at positions the same as us.  A creative CM, a couple defenders to shore up the defense, and depending on Suarez possibly another striker.

We certainly have a shot at the title, but lets keep in mind there are at least 4 other teams that will believe that they can take the title.  Of those 4 teams, 3 of them have the bankrolls to bring in every plaything that their new coaches would want.  Ourselves, Arsenal and Liverpool are a bit more cost conscious in our spending, have good squads and returning coaches.

Alcohol is unregulated? That's news to me. Unless you mean regulated consumption but if you want to go there you are opening pandora's box. Also if you don't think police deal with drunken crime you've got your head up your ass, in fact I'm surprised you are not banging on about how much you think that enforcement is costing. But thank you for explaining what you mean for once but then we have the following which is most ridiculous thing I've ever heard said on reddit and *thats* saying something.

&gt;But refined, ""pure"" alcohol is a reletively recent invention (last 300 years or so). Using fermentation as a form way to sterlise liquids has been practiced for millenia, but ""binge drinking"" is a modern scourge.

Wine is a strong drink and distilled spirits we have records of going back 600 years in our neck of the woods even if they've only been widely produced in the UK since 1660 (I think) which doesn't change the point that we seem to be doing just fine. How ""modern"" do you mean by modern because you've pointed out elsewhere the wonderful world of gin. 

Either way your point seems to be that we've managed the most successful and advancing periods in our history during the time we've had the strongest and largest consumption of alcohol. Which is not me saying it helped but if it's such a societal ill you'd have expected to see signs of it hurting.  

&gt;I said the ""people will do it anyway"" arguement does not work. It Does. Not. Work. in any way whatsoever. It's not an arguement for or against. It's a nonsense. You can't use it to support a case and it cannot be used to undermine one either. It simply DOES NOT WORK. It has no place in discussion. My quick ""argument in extremis"" to show that it's a nonsense seems to have gone way over your head…

So you throw out a ridiculous *unrelatable* example, I point out how it doesn't apply and doing so is idiotic and then give you two definitive real world examples of what I'm talking about and your answer to that is.... 

&gt; DOES NOT WORK

If it doesn't work explain why my examples are wrong or I'll simply have to presume you can't. If you want something that definitely doesn't work it's simply stating that your right, without explaining your self, and expecting to win a debate. It's childish and ridiculous and unless you are willing to defend your points and explain why mine are wrong why the fuck, and I'm sorry for swearing but this really bugs me, are you even talking?  

In short respond to my points and explain *why they are wrong* or shut the hell up as you clearly has no interest in actual discourse and are only interested in preaching.   

&gt;Many food products, over-the-counter drugs, etc. have been banned and are now basically unheard of. Basically, unless it gets you ""high"" nobody cares that they don't have the right to use it...

If those products can be replaced by something else that does the same job then yes they will despair if they are made illegal. Which we can largely do with food and over the counter drugs. We've got nothing that we can legally consume outside of their medical uses that reproduces the effects of drugs.

So if you are just going to stamp your foot and insist you are right without explaining your reasoning in your reply I'm going to presume you are the petulant child that would make you. If you actually want to discuss this like an adult who actually has a point to make rather than a agenda to preach I'll happily reply.

true,tbiz_werkin,flair5,,"I agree with most of your original points as well as those made by /u/dirtyewok.  However, I think we need to remember that Sandro and Kaboul are both coming back from pretty significant injuries and while we remember them at their best, it's hard to say whether they will truly be back to that level when they return.  Injuries such as they had are many times repetitive injuries, though fingers crossed that doesn't happen.  Plus, who knows what our injuries will look like next season.  One place where the teams above us generally are able to out pace us is in squad depth.  Sure we lost Kaboul and Sandro, but maybe next year we lose Bale and Lloris.  Impossible to tell, but we just don't have the squad depth to compensate for that unlike the big guns.  

Also, like /u/dirtyewok said, while we strengthen, so will the teams above us.  If Chelsea end up with Falcao or someone along those lines, they will be the odds on favorite for sure, especially with Mou back at the helm.  I'd be happy with a 3rd place finish with Arse finishing 6th behind Everton (of course would love for them to be relegation fodder, but don't see that happening in a million years).  I would, at this point, predict a table such as this (though realistically Arsenal will probably still finish in the top 4, probably at the expense of City):

1). Chelsea
2). ManU
3). Spurs
4). City
5). Everton

It's largely unregulated, I suppose the word ""completely"" was a hyperbole too far, I apologise. Apart from age limits and mild taxation, you can buy as much as you want and consume it almost anywhere without limitation.

&gt; Also if you don't think police deal with drunken crime you've got your head up your ass, in fact I'm surprised you are not banging on about how much you think that enforcement is costing.

The very poor level of enforcement we have costs a lot yes, but the amount of petty damage, theft and neisance that's just written off by victims who know the police can't/won't do anything is astronomical. Try living near a major university for a while and see what it's like… Ask garages how many wingmirrors they replace (at the owner's expense) due to drunken idiots breaking them as they walk down the street, see how many garden fences need repairing, how many traffic cones get stolen, roadsigns damaged, etc, etc. The real cost of cheap, easily-available alcohol is massively underreported.

&gt;Wine is a strong drink 

Wine is rarely more than 20% ABV. Modern spirits come at up to 60% ABV. Such highly alcoholic beverages have never been available so widely at such low prices.

&gt; So you throw out a ridiculous unrelatable example, I point out how it doesn't apply and doing so is idiotic and then give you two definitive real world examples of what I'm talking about and your answer to that is….


It wasn't an example. It was an ""arguement in extremis"" i.e. I took the principle and showed it's most rediculous extreme interpretation to illustrate how it's just a nonsensical argument.

I can't see how gay marriage fits in the ""people will do it anyway"" arguement, maybe if you were talking about banning homosexual activity, it might make sense, but the ""people will do it anyway"" arguement certainly doesn't fit there.

As for circumventing DRM, ""people will do it anyway"" is still not a reason to legalise it. Basic principles of property are the main argument… Saying ""people will do it anyway"" adds nothing to the discussion.

&gt; If those products can be replaced by something else that does the same job then yes they will despair if they are made illegal.

I assume you mean ""If those products _can't_ be replaced…"". In which case, of course drugs can be replaced!

true,dwair,eng-Cornwall,Kernow,"&gt;2) People only really need to see a doctor when they are ill.

Couple of years ago I had some chest pains and mistakenly thought they were side effects of the drugs I was on so I tried to get a Dr's appointment.  The receptionist could only give me an appointment in a couple of weeks so I hung on for a few days continuing with the meds I was on before I had enough and the wife drove me the 50 odd miles to hospital where I got seen at A&amp;E and booked in for emergency bi-pass surgery.  A few years before that I had a similar experience with Malaria.  Tried to wait for the appointment, gave in after a few days, went to A&amp;E instead and spent the next 2 weeks in an ICU ward hooked up to some machines. 

Lesson learned - DO NOT go to your GP if your ill, go to A&amp;E.  They have nurses and people there who can assess how ill you are.  A level 2 NVQ in ""Surgery Reception Duty's"" does not qualify a receptionist in triage despite what they believe of themselves.  Your GP is apparently only there for vaccinations, signing off repeat prescriptions and in growing toe nails by appointment 6 weeks in advance.  If your sick, go to hospital.  God I hate these petty tyrants of the appointment system!! 

NB I have nothing against GP's or their service.  I think they do a great job in extremely difficult circumstances. Its the system that is wrong and I worry that under UK employment law you can't seem to sack receptionists who both are incompetent and should not be working in public facing job.

To further the point, only 65% of the voting population turned out to vote in 2010, so with really rough estimates (and I did this kind of quick) thats about 18.5m people that didn't have their say in the election, which is a game changer. But who would these people vote for?

true,hotcod,null,null,"&gt;It's largely unregulated, I suppose the word ""completely"" was a hyperbole too far, I apologise. Apart from age limits and mild taxation, you can buy as much as you want and consume it almost anywhere without limitation.

So I'm just imagining alcohol free zones then? 

&gt;The very poor level of enforcement we have costs a lot yes, but the amount of petty damage, theft and neisance that's just written off by victims who know the police can't/won't do anything is astronomical. Try living near a major university for a while and see what it's like… Ask garages how many wingmirrors they replace (at the owner's expense) due to drunken idiots breaking them as they walk down the street, see how many garden fences need repairing, how many traffic cones get stolen, roadsigns damaged, etc, etc. The real cost of cheap, easily-available alcohol is massively underreported.

I have both been to uni and lived by them and I've lived in town centers all my life. I've had just as much crap and things broken by none drunken people as I have drunks. This includes a few of my teeth. 

&gt;Wine is rarely more than 20% ABV. Modern spirits come at up to 60% ABV. Such highly alcoholic beverages have never been available so widely at such low prices.

Again you skipping over gin but I was making the point that while it may be easier to get drunk now the levels of drunk have been largely attainable for a very long time.

&gt;It wasn't an example. It was an ""arguement in extremis"" i.e. I took the principle and showed it's most rediculous extreme interpretation to illustrate how it's just a nonsensical argument.

Except the extreme you took it to required you to change the context of harm and choice from one of personal choice and personal harm to removing choice and doing harm. Which is not the same thing. I will state it's not comparable because I've explained my reasoning that you've yet to even bother to address were as you are simply insisting you are right.

I also pointed out that we don't make murder illegal to stop people doing it but to give us recourse in dealing with those who will try or have done it but I see you ignored that and never answered the simple question of ""do you not murder people because it illegal or because murdering is wrong?"". Which is again what your argument is implying that you think. 

&gt;I can't see how gay marriage fits in the ""people will do it anyway"" arguement, maybe if you were talking about banning homosexual activity, it might make sense, but the ""people will do it anyway"" arguement certainly doesn't fit there.

My point about the gay marriage bill was that since 1861 we've gone from homsexuality (or at lest expressions of it) being a capital offence, to it being illegal with jail terms, to it being legal for people of 18+ to have sex, to having the same age of consent, to being able to have legal protection of their partnerships inline with straight couples to being allowed to marry. 

A case in which something illegal on to death that *people did anyway* being decriminalized and then legally normalised as social attitudes and ideas of harm change in advance of the laws that are informed by them mostly driven by the fact *those people would risk death to do it anyway*. 

You seem to be mistaking what is an argument for reexamination of laws, asking why people break the laws anyway, with justification in doing so. Case in point...

&gt;As for circumventing DRM, ""people will do it anyway"" is still not a reason to legalise it. Basic principles of property are the main argument… Saying ""people will do it anyway"" adds nothing to the discussion.

If people break the law because they don't think that law is to be respected due to other social or legal ideas then it's time to reconsider the nature and need of that law because law can not do a job that the people largely think it should not. In other words you seem to be somewhat wilfully missing the point now.

People breaking laws because they don't think they are valid is one of the main driving forces behind reform of our laws and if there is societal change in which laws are largely being ignored we have to re-examine what those laws are meant to be doing and why they've been broken. This is the key that you seem to be missing in an attempt to simplify the argument so you can claim you've won it.

&gt;I assume you mean ""If those products can't be replaced…"". In which case, of course drugs can be replaced! Some people on this very thread are talking about the legalisation of ""less-dangerous"" drugs as an alternative to tobacco and alcohol! So which is it?

No, I mean can, if you can replace a dangerous food stuff with another food stuff that does the same thing if you ban the first foodstuff it will go away. In large parts with food and medicine we have a large range of comparative products that will fulfill the need in one way or another that the dangerous product did hence why you can point to them and say ""banning those worked"" while missing *why* banning those worked. It's another case of you taking one small, misunderstood, part of a much more complex argument and attempting to use one reading of it to say ""i win"". 

Also I'm not the other people in this thread and I don't care what they are saying, unless I've said it it has no place in your decision *with me* of points *I've made*. 

But lets talk about tobacco because there is something fascinating going on there at the moment. E-cigs, they can largely replace tobacco (and big tobacco companies are pouring vast amounts of money into finding a way to totally replace it because even they can see the writing on the wall) while seeming being far less dangerous to the user and those around them. If they are proved to be safe/er (and I'd be much happier if they were regulated at all by the way) then I think the government would actually be able to ban tobacco because people would have a viable alternative to it.

I kind of see your point. But cyclist are traffic, as a (norwich) cyclists I constantly get stuck behind cars, or in traffic jams on my commute, its cars that cause it. If not for cars I could shave a 1/3 of my commute time easly.

Fact is, cyclists might be slow, but they do not cause the congestion cars do. So when I hear someone is unable to overtake a cyclist for whatever reason (and see them as a problem) I have to ask do you dislike car drivers for the cars that cause you similar problems?


BTW, kinda topical. There is a movement currently calling for all inner city traffic (uk wide)  to be reduced from 30 to 20mph. If this came in cyclists would be less of an issue as they would never need to be overtaken.

There is a religious dimension to all this argument. In my mature years, I’m finally beginning to understand the Bible! For those who haven’t heard, the State of Washington just passed two laws:

* Same-sex Marriage

* Legalized Marijuana

The fact that same-sex marriage and marijuana were legalized on the same day makes perfect biblical sense because Leviticus 20:13 says:“If a man lies with another man they should be stoned.”

Young players who have shown they have the ingredients to make it in the big leagues. 

Holtby, Siggurdson, Lloris and to a lesser extent (due to being 25) Vertonghen and Dembele are the kind of signings we need. On the cusp of greatness and with the right manager + game time in the premier league CL quality players for sure. The best part is that they are affordable.

I think value wise that pool of aforementioned players has increased in value by about £25m in the one year (mainly due to Vertonghen asserting himself as a top CB and Holtby being so cheap). Great shopping.

Unfortunately I am a software engineer and not a player scout so I am unsure who the next batch of players are (Eriksen for £12m comes to mind, but Dortmund want and will get him).

Out of everything that will happen this summer, I'm fired up - Spurs will have the most consistency in lineup from season to season, stability in management, and quality of play to tear through the Premiership standings with fury.

AVB believes it, the squad believes it, and for me that's enough.

Some quick pointers, to help prevent as much as hair loss &amp; binge drinking (through stress in calling them) as possible:

1) The phone call is going to cost some pretty pennies. Call on a landline if you can. Expect to be there for a while.

2) You *will* be on hold for a *very* long time. It is *severely* understaffed, couple this with the above, and you are going to get very angry very quickly. You will be paying a premium rate to listen to My Heart Will Go On for the next 25/30 minutes, *over* and *over*.

3) Due to the above two points, try to minimise the wait:

Many people will call as they make their way to work, the minute the centre opens. Don't do this. It's even more understaffed that early in the morning. Avoid 8-9 at all costs.

Many people will call as they are on their lunch break. Avoid 12-2 at all costs.

Many people will call as they finish work right until the centre closes. Avoid 4-8 at all costs.

Many people will call on a Monday any way, as they might get correspondence from the HMRC on the weekend. Avoid Monday at all costs.

Many people will call on a Saturday due to the fact it's never quiet during the times they can call (i.e they are working 8-9 hours a day, they only times they can call is when everyone else is calling). Avoid Saturday entirely.

I would suggest calling in between those times. You will still be waiting, but hopefully for much less.

4) You *may* speak to someone who will not be 100% sure, so be prepared to be on hold with them as well, whilst they check your details over with a supervisor etc. Remember tax is overly complicated so it's only natural they might want to double check on things before they give you a definite answer.

5) My longest wait time was just over 30 minutes.

6) They do not allow email correspondence for ""security reasons"".

7) They do allow snail mail/letter correspondence but they can take up to a maximum of 8/9 weeks to come back with a reply, especially around financial year end. Be prepared that the advisor may turn round and ask you for some proof of earnings etc, which is going to be sent by post and thus falls under ""we get a lot of post, we'll get to it"".

That seems to be a contradiction… It's easier to get drunk now, yet it's been attainable for a very long time? Either it's easier now or it isn't… Sure, people got drunk in the past, but the levels of drunkenness and associated criminal behavior has grown exponentially in the last 20 years or so.

true,gooneruk,cnty-england,London,"I think I can provide a bit of an insight from both sides of the fence. I'm a season ticket holder at Arsenal, and have been a fan for as long as I can remember. I've had my season ticket for 4 years now, and attended games on and off for a few years before that.

Arsenal is my true love when it comes to sport, and I'll admit to being thoroughly biased when it comes to any coverage of them, or our rivals. At the same time, I think I'm a bit of a cynic when it comes to the whole tribalism thing, and I'm not entirely blind to any hypocrisy which my passion for my team can cause.

When you're at a game where you're a big fan of a particular team, it's very easy to get caught up in the us-v-them mentality, especially as part of a big crowd. Anonymity as part of a big group, that kind of thing. I join in with the baiting of the opposition fans when inside the stadium (sometimes, a football match simply happens whilst two groups of people have a singing contest around them), but not to the point of vicious hatred. Winding them up is fine, but going into full-on abuse is pointless.

And football fans aren't generally that bad, honest! Of course there are idiots, but find me any group of 30,000 guys and you'll find a whole bunch of idiots there too. Sometimes, when your team is beaten you can recognise that the other team was genuinely better. I've clapped off opposition teams plenty of times when they've performed well, as have many others in the stadium. Equally, I've booed my own team when they've performed below the expectations I have for them (and that they should have for themselves).

There's a couple of other teams that I have a soft spot for, football-wise, because of where I grew up and where I live now. When I go to their games, I don't get the same sense of the result being all-important, nor do I feel the need to get properly involved in any big crowd noise. I'm there more as a spectator than a fan, really, but still somewhere in between.

If I go to other matches, or even other sports, I don't really follow a team other than our national teams. I love watching the sports (Rugby union is about my other favourite), and as you say enjoy the spectacle and the prowess shown, but it doesn't have quite the same emotional impact on me.

I watch a stupid amount of sport on TV as well, and the reason I do is essentially for the sheer amount of unknown in any contest, any match. Anything really can happen, from an upset by an underdog, to that underdog getting absolutely walloped by a better opponent. It's entertaining, it's unpredictable, and it's enjoyable.

But which do I prefer, which has more impact on me? It's always the one I care about more. The emotional investment I make in that sporting contest is reflected back by the enjoyment factor being ratcheted up as well (yes, even when we lose). It sticks in my memory longer, and any highs feel that much higher.",0,1369150685,null,0,1369150879,0,ca328m9,t3_1erea8,t1_ca328m9,t1_ca30kts,null,1431083966,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15

Players will develop with successful loan spells, but if he fails to get significant playing time with us (possible) or struggles with the pressure (he's only 20, very possible), that could be disastrous.

If it were me, I would try and sign a veteran striker who I think has maybe ~3 good years left. I'd send Lukaku on loan one more year. The following year I would offload Torres, bring Lukaku back and have him transition into being our #1 with an established striker mentoring him/splitting time.

---

As far as the other players? Courtois should stay out on loan. I don't see any point in bringing him back yet. Chalobah should also probably do another year on loan.

The guys I'd really want to bring back would be De Bruyne and McEachren. I think Kevin could slot right in and win a starting spot in the pivot, or #8 if we play a 4-3-3.

Hi, I like many other fans aren't happy with the fact The Echo has sold out to Facebook with regards to the comments sections on their articles.

I sent out an email to Neil McDonald, the manager of the website with my concerns and I received a reply...LET ME KNOW YOUR FEELINGS!! And if you can email him with your feelings, in a decent manner.

You can find his email on the Contact Us page on The Echo Website.

Cheers - podpool.

Hi, 

I would like to make you aware of my feelings about the new format of the comments section on the Echo website. 

I was a notable contributor to the site, but will not be using the site in its current format. Forcing users to use their Facebook login's is nothing short of disgusting. The old format worked very well, why change something that did not need changing? You will lose many users with the current format in place. Please change back to the old format. Some of the users who commented were almost like a family.

Regards. 
.

to me 
Hello,

thanks for your email about the new website and commenting.

In terms of why we have changed to Facebook commenting, our user testing for our new website showed us that people were put off by having to go through a long registration process in order to comment, so we wanted to make it easier for people to get involved without opening the floodgates to spammers. 

Facebook helps to give users that experience.

We also wanted to offer a personalisation service, that recommends articles to you and gives you a better experience the more you come to the site. This currently only works with Facebook.

Unfortunately, technical reasons meant we were unable to keep our previous registration process as well as Facebook, but we think it's the right decision for the majority of our readers.

I am sorry for the inconvenience this causes you and hope you keep reading our articles and give our new commenting system a try. I also hope you agree with me that the new website is a massive improvement on the old one.

All the best,

Neil

Neil, 

Thanks for your reply, it is appreciated. I agree with your last point that the website aesthetically is a massive improvement.

I am still quite saddened though by the fact the you have sold out to Facebook. You could have looked at alternative methods for users to post ie/ Disqus, which almost all of the broadsheet newspapers use for articles which incite comments. I have been part of the Echo a very long time, commenting on LFC articles and I know a lot of the users who have also been posting for a very long time are upset the same as me.

It would be beneficial to us as fans and you as a newspaper to find a comprise and allow users to post using their previous accounts. The registration process is a one off system, and requires a user to sign up once and then simply login and post. You can already see the affect this has had on people posting comments already. The latest match report has received 20 comments in total, the majority of which are complaints with regards to the format.

This was once a place for us fans to communicate with each other and post our opinions and spark debate, whether that be on footballing subjects, or more poignant subjects such as Hillsborough. There was a togetherness about the site. 

This new format has taken this all away - I feel that strongly about it, and I know the majority of the users do.

As mentioned if there is some way you can compromise; a method other than having to hold a Facebook account, I and the majority of users would be extremely grateful.


Regards

&gt;I know it's not comparable! I'm just taking your principle (that ""what people do anyway"" should be legal) and showing that it only ""works"" within your tightly-defined parameters and thus, the principle itself has no purpose, no real meaning, except as a paper-thin ""argument"" to support your point of view.
&gt;I'm not talking about chaning social attitudes, that's a completely different matter, nor whether the law in an area ""should be respected"". If you want to make the argument that the law regarding drugs should not be respected for some moral reason (like that with digital copyright enforcement) then go ahead, but you haven't made that point and I haven't argued against it...

Except change social attitudes is what this is all about we are seeing drug use more widely socially accepted and the harm of a lot of that drug use shown to be largely the same or even less so of those drugs that are already legal. People as a result take drugs and disrespect the law because it's increasingly not representing social norms and is based on an outdated and non evidence based idea of harm. 

*That* is what we are talking about, or the rest of us anyway, if you don't understand or can't accept that that not my problem.

&gt;Yet for some reason, people are perfectly ok, supportive even, with that when it comes to foodstuffs, yet it's a violation of their personal freedoms when it comes to drugs! Why ban dangerous foodstuffs and allow dangerous drugs? Surely if people can be trusted to make their own minds up about drugs, they can do the same for foodstuffs?

Because, again, this is not that simple, food stuff's can largely be replaced by other food stuffs that are much the same but do less harm. That can not be said of drugs and is you *again* refusing to consider any other explanation that does not fit your narrative.

Unless we add enough top players to add about 70m in wages, there is absolutely zero precedent to support this. 

Hell, one of the things Arsenal fans keep saying is that they would have made a title challenge had RVP stayed but even THAT had no precedent. 

I did a bit of digging through wage data over the past decade or so when I was making my point to said Gooners and the closest the 4th highest wage bill has finished to the top in 10 years is 9 points off the top of the league. We have the 6th highest wage bill and we aren't even close to the likes of Arsenal or even Liverpool in that regard.

Now that doesn't mean there isn't reason to be optimistic about the future. If we DO build this stadium we will probably be a bit stagnant in the short term but it will open doors for us long term. I think the way we're developing our young players is improving rapidly and for the first time in a while we have some real prospects and indeed products. 

That said every year is different and it might be even harder next season. It's very tough to predict what's going to happen with the 3 best teams all getting new managers. I think if we add a couple of key players there's no reason to think we can't finish top 4 comfortably. We could have done that this season if we'd found even 6-8 more goals from somewhere.

true,mallardtheduck,null,East Midlands,"&gt; Except change social attitudes is what this is all about we are seeing drug use more widely socially accepted and the harm of a lot of that drug use shown to be largely the same or even less so of those drugs that are already legal.

That's a completely different argument to the ""people will do it anyway"" one you were making eariler. However, the ""people can hurt themselves with A, let's allow them to do it with B too"" isn't a compelling argument either in my opinion.

&gt; People as a result take drugs and disrespect the law because it's increasingly not representing social norms and is based on an outdated and non evidence based idea of harm.

The law is _always_ outdated. It's supposed to be. It leads to a stable society. Making major changes to the law on a regular basis means that legal precendents are never properly established and consquiently the level of legal uncertainty and the possibility of injustice is increased.

Now, you may argue that it's time for a change in the law and I'd agree. Criminalising drug addicts who want to seek treatment is a bad thing, but the idea that canabis should be as unregulated and freely available as alcohol is (again, my opinion) an awful idea.

&gt; Because, again, this is not that simple, food stuff's can largely be replaced by other food stuffs that are much the same but do less harm. 

But that has nothing to do with ""freedom"". And nobody is forced to take illegal drugs. There are alternatives to taking them...

true,Frosstbyte,null,null,"I mean, fine.  Clearly Moffat is literally obsessed with the notion of the Doctor being the ""madman with a box"", despite the fact that being a madman with a box is only one aspect of the Doctor's personality.  All of the satanic characterization of the Doctor you've so meticuously found doesn't really say anything to me other than to confirm what we already knew: that Moffat likes highlighting how incomprehensibly old, powerful and out of touch the Doctor is compared to the human race which captures his imagination and attention.

And while it's fun to speculate about the nature of the Doctor, and John Hurt's incarnation of him, the fundamental fact is that the Devil, conceptually and mythologically, is a being of pure evil, who intends to do evil, and to corrupt everyone around him to do evil.  The Devil is jealous of God's power, and created evil in an attempt to take that power for his own.

Even at his very worst, I think you would be incredibly hard pressed to find a convincing argument that the Doctor fits any of those characteristics.  He may lie.  He may work for his own ends.  He may not be absolutely moral in some traditionally Christian sense, but to call him the Devil, or to characterize him as the Devil lacks both foundation and follow through.  Even in Moffat's era, we have consistently seen the Doctor work to save people, to defeat evil and to inspire goodness, to say nothing for how his other incarnations acted.  He has literally remade time and the universe to save lives and make the world better.

Lucifer comes to evil because of jealousy.  He makes war on God because he wants what God has, and, after he fails, he creates evil in man.  Nothing about that story matches with anything we know about any incarnation of the Doctor, ever, *including* John Hurt's!  Lucifer does not justify his war on heaven, and he especially would not justify his war on heaven ""in the name of peace and sanity.""  Lucifer did it in his own name, to glorify himself, and he was very up front about that fact.

This is the problem with the Moffat era.  Moffat likes to put all of these things together in a vacuum, as if they can be isolated from their context.  Even if everything you've observed was intentional (I'm not convinced it was, but it may have been), characterizing the Doctor as the evil makes no sense in the context of 1) who the Doctor *has been* or 2) what the Devil is and symbolizes.  The Devil is evil incarnate.  He is selfish betrayal of the natural order of existence because of jealousy.  A characterization of the Devil *requires* a God as counterpoint for him to be jealous of and it *requires* a desire to corrupt others.  I can't think of *any* incarnation of the Doctor who has been jealous of...really anything.  Jealousy is not one of the Doctor's vices.  Additionally, I would be hard pressed to think of any time the Doctor attempted to corrupt others or convince them to do evil.

This is all to say that you may be correct in your analysis of Moffat's scripts, but it is also to say that just because Moffat intends it does not necessarily mean it is well done or makes sense.  We won't know exactly what he has planned until November, but I think leaning on any analysis which casts the Doctor as the greatest force for evil in the entire universe ever, a jealous corruptor bent on spreading his corruption in violation of how the world ought to be is going to be an exceedingly difficult path and one which I am not convinced anyone can pull off convincingly.  The show is called Doctor Who.  The Doctor is our fifty year protagonist.  There is a very fine line between hero, anti-hero and villain.  A Doctor who is Raylan Givens, i.e. someone who does bad things because he's trying to do right and we can agree that his aims are right, is one thing, and probably more compelling than a Doctor who is Superman, but I do not want really want to watch a Doctor who does bad because he *is* bad and wants to *do* bad, which is the only direction a satanic analysis of the Doctor can go.",0,1369153184,null,0,false,0,ca334xa,t3_1eq0lm,t1_ca334xa,t3_1eq0lm,null,1431083543,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Vertonghen. The guy has slotted into the team near seamlessly and has absolutely bossed it in his first year. I wouldn't have been surprised if there were a few teething problems but from day dot he has been one of our best players. It didn't seem to matter that he played in a new backline (or with a new keeper) every other week, he got stuck in and produced some very Ledley-esque tackles. 5 goals in the league isn't bad either.

Looking forward I would like to see some of Dawson's passion and leadership skills rub off on him. I have Vert earmarked as the future captain and he needs to be able to perform with Caulker next to him as well as he does with the old head Gallas/Dawson. 

&gt;Under performer

Lennon. He seemed a bit too toothless for me this year. The Man U game aside I can't think of a game where he struck fear into the opponents (and that was because they were so damn focused on Bale). There wasn't a great deal of improvement in his end product over the course of the year and with Townsend snapping at his heels I think he needs to do a bit more. 

There were a few games this year when a team pressed him well enough (preventing him from getting into space) and he was completely nullified - to the point of needing to be subbed off, he needs to assert himself on the ball better and clean up his end product in my opinion. 

I understand spurs suffered when he got injured, but I believe that is more down to poor backup then the loss of Lennon himself (Dembele on the wing and Livermore/Parker in midfield was never going to be a winning combo).

Plenty of times this year spurs struggled to break down a parked bus and I would rather have a player like Siggy/Holtby on the field who can create then Lennon who felt like a dead weight at times. 

&gt;Up and comer

The argument could very easily be made for Townsend, Rose and Caulker but I personally am very excited about Carroll. He has looked adept and confident when playing (even in a 10 man team against the arse) and appears to be cut out of the same mould as Luka. His biggest drawback is his size, but I feel that will come to him naturally over time.

Based off all the back stories and clara's time wars reading I think its silly to assume anything besides we're finally going to learn how the war began and ended and how this man (Hurt) played a role in it.

My theory relies on Moffat having to have set all this up like any good story teller has to which means that rory and amy had a place in all this. In their last episode Matt insists that Amy not read further into the book than their present or they risk having to do what she reads because it will become a fixed point in their future. This sets up the fact that if the doctor witnesses an event occuring in one way he has to let it happen that way. We infact see 10 try to stop this in ""Water on mars"" but he ultimately fails when the girl shoots herself because she was suppose to die -- it has to happen.

During 10's campaign he says that children of galifrey were brought to the rift in time to stare into and thats when the master had the drum thing happen. What if matt for some reason stared into and saw Hurt and what he does in the time war? He now has to do it. As a young man he is ashamed of this knowledge and he takes up the mantra doctor to heal the people he will eventually hurt and runs away hoping he can avoid it. But hes eventually brought back into the hard of the time war (which by the way is a series of wars not just one; several times its referred to as the 'last of' the time wars so starting it is not doctor's fault in fact its just the daleks being daleks).

Based on what we see from the master episodes the doctor is likewise forced to abide by what he saw and he commits genocide for 'sanity and peace.' I also draw your attention back to the hotel episode with amy,rory, and the minotaur thing where each person has their own 'room.' And when the 11th finds his and opens it up you hear the tardis donging sound like you do in the tomb scene and he says 'of course its you.' I'm guessing the thing that he is most affraid of is Hurt and who he was; who he ran away from.

The questions im left with are who cares? This is all in the past somewhere between 8 and 9th's lives and has no bearing now unless he is somehow still alive? How is it the doctor escaped with his life when he says on multiple occasions that he shouldn't have or that he wish he hadn't done what he had? We all know the Tardis loves the Doctor perhaps it make the doctor go through a meta-crisis that allowed him to become hurt and the 9th and when the 9th realizes what hurt, what he, has done he runs away blood soaked until Rose finds him and fixes him/the 10th.

One of those disasters were caused by poor infrastructure and policing. One was caused by outdated stadium architecture. One wasn't solely fault of English thugs.

I went to my first match as a child almost 25 years ago, and it was a rather different experience to today. The violent tribalism of fans is now in the minority - not that I've ever seen much of it first hand.

I've been to hockey games in Canada which had a similar atmosphere to a football match here. So I'm not sure why it would apparently seem such an alien environment to an American, unless they were expecting it to be like an NFL game (which is like going to a variety show, broken up by moments of sporting action) or a baseball match (which is pretty much as boring and identical to a cricket match).",0,1369154282,null,0,1369164905,0,ca33jlr,t3_1erea8,t1_ca33jlr,t3_1erea8,null,1431083351,21,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,21

Basically, the Valeyard is a personification of all the evil and darkness in the Doctor's heart. He places the Sixth Doctor on trial and it is implied that he's a branch (for lack of a better word). He's not the Doctor himself, he's just the part of the Doctor that the Doctor is capable of *becoming* in his future.

It's stated the the Valeyard is ""born"" sometime between the Doctor's twelfth and final regenerations. We know that the Doctor has a near infinite amount of regenerations now because of River Song's sacrifice so it's relatively safe to assume that the Valeyard will be born sometime between Matt Smith's Doctor and the eventual end of the series.

My own personal theory is the Valeyard is born out of the heart of the ""Nth"" Doctor (because we don't know WHICH Doctor will be *the* Doctor to make the event occur) and *that* Doctor will continue on with his adventures, knowing that Valeyard will put the Sixth on trial and that he will emerge victorious.

So for example, it could be that someone who received £400 in benefits per week could then be on £250, you can see why that could be an issue.

It is not the case that everyone is currently receiving £600 and it's being cut to £500. 

I think further the issue is that there is no work locally and rents are so stupidly high in London that people won't be able to afford to live there, but also won't necessarily be able to afford to move, thus become homeless.  

Also bare in mind the cost of renting in London, with average rents for a 2 bed flat in Ealing being [1684pm](http://www.zoopla.co.uk/market/ealing/)/400 per week, and Croydon it's £[1082](http://www.zoopla.co.uk/market/london/croydon/)/250p/w. So with a benefit cap of £500 a week, a large chunk is already gone on rent.

We are talking on the first floor but you are using an argument that only makes sense on the 10th to explain why I'm wrong and then you are accusing me of making a difference argument by point out we are standing on the first floor. It's maddening because you shift the context of the argument to whatever you think best suits your point at the time. 

&gt;The law is always outdated. It's supposed to be. It leads to a stable society. Making major changes to the law on a regular basis means that legal precendents are never properly established and consquiently the level of legal uncertainty and the possibility of injustice is increased.

On the other hand if you never allow for changes in law then laws can start to fail the serve the people then the system becomes unstable. As it turns out we live in a society that is advancing faster and is changing being studied more than nearly any other period in history and hold too tight to a law for it's own sake is a huge mistake as a result. 

&gt;Now, you may argue that it's time for a change in the law and I'd agree. Criminalising drug addicts who want to seek treatment is a bad thing, but the idea that canabis should be as unregulated and freely available as alcohol is (again, my opinion) an awful idea.

You are welcome to your views that it is an awful idea but if things carry on mostly as they have we will see an attempt at some form of regulated distribution with in our lifetime. The evidence so far suggests that this wouldn't be the end of the world but I also understand why you don't accept that as you are clearly incredibly puritan in your views and ""wouldn't be the end of the world"" mostly means ""probably far less harmful than alcohol"" but I get the feeling you'd ban that too. 

&gt;You're refusing to consider any argument that doesn't fit you're preconcieved notions.

How so, I've looked at your argument and addressed most points you've made with counter points. That's considering your argument. On the other hand I have to practically twist your arm to explain your reasoning and beat you about the head with no very nice insults to get you to even bother to engage with my actual points rather than dismissing them. 

I'm still debating with you because I'm open to you proving me wrong or changing my mind. It's the one and only reason to bother debating people on the internet. I will defend my points as vigorously as I can but there is nothing of more value to me than when I've been felt I've been proven wrong and while I have no way of proving this to you a lot of my ideas have been shaped by being proven wrong. In fact when I was younger I'd likely have made similar arguments to yours but time, experience and most of all debates have changed my mind.

As for this one, I was planning on having the dungeon part have weird areas where there was no bottom, and parts that are caves and Nordic ruins and all that. Maybe some Falmer running around, a little pond area filled with oversized mudcrabs. And of course Dwarven Centurions and spiderbots running around. The problem with being actually ""wall-less"" is that you end up with just the blue void (which is actually why I used Azura's Star as the base for the 'control room'.

I'd also point out that you seem to be flipping the usual burden for consent; we don't normally say you have to positively prove consent in all cases, but rather that in those cases where lack of consent can be shown, there is a problem. Furthermore, in your own words it would only apply in the vast majority of cases; is collective punishment not fundamentally illiberal? How is it fair for a small minority of people in genuinely consensual relationships face criminal sanction because of an entirely different group of people who aren't genuinely consenting?

One thing I admire about Fergie and Wenger is that they have a system that is clearly drilled into the players so they all know what they should be doing and what their team-mates will do. A properly drilled team is like having an extra player on the pitch.

Looking at the games we dropped points in this season, how many could we or should we have won? I certainly think that we dropped at least 10 points that we should have easily won if we had a fully fit team. Add in a new striker or two and that would take us up another 5-10pts. Last season we should have finished 2nd quite easily and 3rd the season before, we finished 4th and 5th respectively.

Word gets around, and people realise that if everyone always pays with 20p coins, the machine will quickly run out of 10p coins and most people will get the chocolate for 40p.

true,TJP343,null,null,"Stats comply with my biggest and many others on here's biggest complaint about this team...doing a lot of nothing in possession. They managed the same number of goals as last season but that has to be down in a large, large part to Bale's exceptional ability to create something from nothing time and time again.

The drop in possession percentage and drop in pass completion percentage is an unwelcome development. But for me the worst stat in this whole article is the drop in forward passes and the increase in square passes. After averaging 47.5 of passes being forward passes in the two years prior, Spurs tumbled down to 32% this season, with an 11% increase in square passes. So despite spending more time in the opponents half, the creativity element of the team to go forward and pierce defenses wasn't there.

It's easy to blame this on Modric's departure and no direct replacement, but also the loss of Sandro for Parker wasn't going to help either and neither is Bale being fielded in the middle where he can get crowded out. The fact that Dempsey was chosen to slip into the middle when Bale wasn't there isn't going to help matters either.

Hopefully this spurs(ha) a switch to a 4-3-3 next season in which Sandro can shield the back four and free up Dembele to push on more and someone with a little more creativity like Siggy or Holtby can be the third midfielder and more creative passing exchanges will result from those three because I don't see it coming from Parker, Bale or Dempsey.",0,1369158735,null,0,false,0,ca3599p,t3_1er4an,t1_ca3599p,t3_1er4an,null,1431082544,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

true,[deleted],null,null,"But what about people who can only attain sexual release with an animal? Should they be forbidden to ever experience their sexuality?

That's actually an interesting part of the gay debate to me. Theres the ""anything that doesn't obviously seem to hurt anyone should be allowed"" argument, but there is also the ""not being able to fully experience sexuality is a source of suffering and un-necessary suffering is wrong"" argument. Technically we could set up goat brothels for those guys where they need to cultivate a relationship with the goats and shit - but then it gets to the point where its ridiculously expensive.

And that's interesting to me, because I see the gayok vs nogay argument is basically one of cultural aesthetics at root. Sexuality is both more fluid (we could all get into fucking a goat if we really put our minds to it, but we don't want to because ew goats and ow our self image) and less essential (true forced loneliness and involuntary celibacy are not that fucking bad if you quit wallowing in it and sublimate all that frustration into some hobby or other) than all that.

It's not an issue that matters if it's just about the sexuality, but it's not actually about sexuality at all.

true,FratBroMeow,present,makelelelelele,"While I agree with the sentiment that this is never happening in a million years, what you have to consider is the amount the club would make on shirt sales/general publicity alone. While his wages would be another hefty sum, Real Madrid made £80m within the first YEAR on his jersey sales alone (this was back in 2010 so I'm sure the number is significantly higher now).

Chelsea is quickly becoming a brand name club worldwide and a move like this could push us into the realm of the Man U's/RM/Barca's etc. He's got world-wide name recognition, even here in the US. Some of my closest friends couldn't tell you the first thing about soccer but they still recognize names like Ronaldo/Messi/Barcelona/Manchester United/etc. 

Never gonna happen, but it makes much more financial sense than some people might think.

I'm honestly unsure what his next destination will be, if any. Here's a list of the teams who can afford him and my thoughts on them:

I highly doubt he'll go to PSG - I think the criticism he would receive for moving to a league that is generally regarded as ""beneath"" the EPL/La Liga in terms of overall talent would drive him insane. Plus he doesn't speak the language, doesn't have any international teammates on the team to help him ease the transition, etc. 

Monaco is years away from getting a guy on Ronaldo's level unless they offer him INSANE (I'm talking 400-500k a *week* in wages) money. He'd face even harsher criticism (which does eventually wear down even the most resolute of people).

I can't see him going back to Manchester United know that SAF is gone. I think that was the ""main attraction"" for him going back and I can't see Moyes going from his budget at Everton to buying Ronaldo anytime soon. 

Definitely not going to Barcelona/Bayern. Considering Pep is now at Bayern and I don't even think it's legal to have Messi and Ronaldo on the same team. That shit would be ridiculous. Ronaldo seems to disdain Barca even moreso than a bunch of his teammates so that seems like the last place he'd end up.

He'd be taking a dump on SAF/Man United fans if he went to City. I understand Man U fans greatly dislike us but this would be an entirely different level of ""betrayal"" and I don't think he would do that. 

Believe it or not, I think Chelsea makes the most sense other than him staying at Real Madrid (which he should). 

Money talks though and if he decides to move to a place for reasons other than sport (read: $$$) then all bets are off.

It's anyone's guess as to what that disgrace was (mine would be sacrificing his fellow Time Lords and family for ""the greater good"" and running away), or whether Hurt will be the villain or just a glimpse into the past that 11 and human-10 have to face up to.

*I'll add an edit in here that he technically could be a future Doctor, of course, because this is a fiction and Moffat can basically do what he wants, sensical or no - his writing can come off as pretty wonky and forced. But for 11 to know of that future, all Doctors must have known, which would basically be re-writing Who history because there's no mention or hint of it in the classics. Makes more sense that it was before 9 and only a burden of these past 3 Doctors who all showed signs of it - 9 with his guilt and anger, 10 with his compassion and forgiveness, and now 11 forced to face the past he was running from.

We even had a 50% discount for the first 3 months, with only a year long contract.

The speed we get is exactly what we pay for, within a few kb/s when downloading at least, not enough to make a noticeable difference. There also doesn't appear to be any sort of traffic shaping. I can sit and download torrents all day and not have any limitations or anything kick in.

I was sat outside College the other day watching people and traffic and noticed so many idiots on bicycles.

Lots of people riding on the path too (mainly students)

I've noticed a trend.  Shit bike, no helmet = shit riding.  People will ""the gear"" tend to be the ones riding safely.

But I also noticed over 20 drivers go through red lights.  Lots of speeding and I lost count of the people stopping the the ACL or over the white lines at pedestrian crossings.  

Leeds needs cycling infrastructure and more room for pedestrians.  It caters too much for cars, cars which hammer it around way too fast.  Calverley St onto Great George Street is horrible at the best of times and the corner on Wellington Street after the train station to get into the centre is full of drivers going way too fast.  It'd be nice to have a blanket 20 limit in the centre and average speed cameras enforcing it.

&gt; Cyclists are the worse for forgetting they are under the laws of the highway code and have to stop (or at least unmount) at red lights.

I disagree with that given the amount of red light jumping vehicles I see every time I'm out and about.  The main difference is most of the people on bikes that go through red lights don't put anyone in danger, while most cars put their foot down to beat amber.

And again he was on his way out but stuck around and adapted to AVB's insistence on a high defensive line. Plain Old John Terry, another not so young, no so quick, English centerback did not do this last season. Dawson adapted well where others like him could not, he deserves a lot of credit for that.

Dempsey, yea, Dempsey tapped in some goals, hell even the last one he had was from thirty yards out and you could still say he poached that one too! He was relatively uninvolved with the build-up and was lost for long stretches in far too many matches. Would drop Dempsey to a 6 and Dawson up to a 7.5.

It's in their twee tone and banal style ill suited for sports writing. Their sports pages proper are ok, but this seems like a feature article.

The more passionate fans in American sports are college fans. American professional sports have likewise suffered from the tickets at the new stadiums being too expensive for the Average Joe. Time was, cheap seats at pro games were the price of movie tickets. Those days are gone.

Also - this writer has most likely never been to a game in Philadelphia, where the fans were so thuggish, they had a judge at the football games for years to quickly arraign the drunks and fighters. Or Boston or Chicago. Or likely anywhere to a game for fun. Sounds like an anthropologist. Could have made this article a lot more fun. Even the description of cider could have been fun. (We call the alcoholic one hard cider, btw and it's slowly getting more popular.)

Regarding the commercialization of American sports - we're used to it. Barely registers - we know it's alien to you but it doesn't mean we're all brainwashed by it. I don't know how big rugby and cricket, etc. are there but it seemed to me when I was in the UK the only really big money sport with a very passionate fan base was football. So it seems more concentrated. Heard.endless talk about football but don't recall much at all about other sports.

In the states we have four hugely commercial sports, three with seasons well over a hundred games. Have to pay for it somehow.

What have I missed? Where is the paragraph that states state owned entities have to be sold?

services by procuring such services in accordance with

services (*), competitive dialogue or negotiated procedures

That doesn't necessarily entail privatisation. Without going into too much detail, I'm away of a particular part of the public sector that was opened to competition. Over the course of many years, the internal bid won each time the contract came up for renewal. However, the department eventually decided to totally change the scope of the service in such a way to make it impossible for the internal bid to succeed.

He's been way too ineffective in the final third, whether scoring or creating chances, and his insistence on run-first football has often lost us good counter-attacking opportunities which would not have been forgiven if that player was Defoe, Huddlestone or Adebayor.  

He's a good footballer with a rare talent for ghosting past players, and is so powerful that he's been a revelation in the defensive side of the game (when not conceding silly fouls) - but when you look past the win-ratio, which is always a misleading stat, and compare his personal contribution to the top midfielders from the other clubs, you'll surely see that he has a lot more to offer and that he *needs* to offer a lot more.  A couple of great games; but too many where Spurs as a team failed to break defences down and we needed someone who could see the passing option first.  Dembele needs to improve his vision and put more faith in his passing game.

Of course, it's always the danger with players that posses such talents as Dembele; people are naturally inclined to remember a few incidents of magic and nothing more.

You gave him 8.  I'd give him 7.  Not much in it, I suppose.  All relative and that.

Obviously I want everyone to have (for instance) a fair trial but when we get into more blurry areas like marriage and stuff it all gets much more weird. Obviously our society has decided to run with the slogan of equality (although it applies it extremely selectively) and I don't _oppose_ it. I just don't relate to it - it's obvious to me that everyone is different and not equal at all, it's obvious that different people respond better to being treated differently, but _any_ conceivable **codification** of that will fuck things up, I think that _includes_ an ""assume equality"" codification.

To me marriage is an institution for cementing alliances and expanding the working unit for the primitive division of labour. It makes no sense in the context of romantic love alone, in fact we prove this by the fact that people go about having long term romantic partnerships without getting married (including me). Some religious people who were taught sex required marriage are the root of the confusion imo, they thought to have a sexual relationship you had to be married so they conflated ""sexual/romantic relationships"" and the far more pragmatic marital relationship. Talking about equality in those terms is laughable, the institution relates to an era when the idea had no weight at all.

Either way, what gets to me is the sheer hostility this whole issue ignites.

No.

&gt;or are stupid

Perhaps. 

&gt;Also, if a girl asks you to get with her and says she has a boyfriend, but she said she'll break it off soon, what would you do?

Are you having this conversation in the cold light of day? As in 'yes, I'd shag you because I'm dumping Tommy soon'? Disregard anything said pissed. If said whilst sober, well, don't even begin to think about the 'if she was me she'd cheat on me too' because no good relationship is ever formed off the back of casual sex. So you're not even in that equation as far as I'm concerned (read: you shouldn't put yourself in that equation). 

*Sometimes* people seek casual sex when they're in unhappy relationships and *sometimes* I think it's a conduit which allows them to wake up to themselves and finally leave the person that's making them unhappy, and mostly that conduit relationship won't last, but it does serve a purpose of sorts. But the circumstances in which I'd think this even moderately acceptable (no, actually, understandable, not acceptable) are when people have been together for bloody years and just put up with one another for little reason other than being with someone.

Hell, a few years ago he even dethroned Klose as the de-facto striker for the DFB but he stagnated and Klose is now first choice, even at his advanced age. Klose has been injured basically every season in some capacity so I think that's saying something. He used to be decently pacey but he's lost a legitimate step and I personally think he's already hit the apex of his career when he was at Bayern. He played in a weaker (relative to EPL) league on a juggernaut of a team and did tremendously for them. 

What happened the last time we bought a striker who ""lost a step"" because he was injured/(or for whatever reason), around the age of 27, who was formerly an absolute beast before we got him? Obviously this on it's own shouldn't scare us away from future purchases of this nature but it should at least be a word of warning.

Edit: Also, it being the year before a World Cup, he has to go to a team where he will be the consistent starter. Germany has one of the most talented bunch of youngsters in the world and even someone like Gomez isn't a guaranteed selection. Couple that with the fact that Klose is in line to be the starter for Germany (he just shows up big time in tournaments) and Gomez needs to play exceptionally well to see significant time in this World Cup which is probably the last one where he can be a legitimate threat. He'll be 32-33 when the next one comes around and with the talent on the German team that's below the age of 23, I highly doubt he'll even make the roster.
Flip side of that coin is that he could see this as his last shot to impress Low and win himself a World Cup so he could be the hardest working player on and off the pitch on a daily basis knowing anything less than exceptional play will land him on the bench or worse.

I don't think he'll get the time he deserves at Chelsea. He's just not enough of an upgrade, in my opinion, for us to throw all of our eggs into the Gomez basket. Let me be clear, I do believe that he is an upgrade to what we have up top currently (Lukaku needs another year on loan. A 20 year old can't carry the burden of a team like CFC if Torres/Ba can't get it done. He's still physically developing and I think he's too good for purely lesser cup duty and a year away from being a legitimate force in the Champs League. I'd hate to stunt his growth/development for another year). If we get him we will almost surely send Lukaku out on loan and if Gomez doesn't work out/flops/gets hurt  we'll be in the same situation we are this season with only Torres and Ba to carry the load. Too much risk of failure and not a high enough expected rate of return = a no go for me.",0,1369162165,null,0,1369163267,0,ca36n4j,t3_1eqqjp,t1_ca36n4j,t1_ca364fu,null,1431081891,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

A better comparison would be telecoms, which if anything is less of a natural competition than mail. Since BT was privatised it has improved in service dramatically (although it specifically is ludicrously expensive), and there is genuine competition from other companies.

Energy prices have gone up a lot, but that's only because the underlying prices have gone up too.

Obviously Kolo isn't getting any younger but he'll be a great leadership presence on and off the pitch that we'd otherwise lack in Carra's absence.  Being on a free, if we can negotiate his wages to a respectable level then I really don't see a downside in this.

Ilori (**with an I, not an L**) is young and **very** raw. Having only seem very limited footage of him, my opinion isn't as well-informed as it might be.  But from what I've seen, he looks too inexperienced to count on for long stretches of the season if Papadopoulos, for example, gets injured.  Still, he's a very promising talent and one for the future. Rather sign him now than one year from now where his price could be £10m higher.

As previously mentioned, Kyriakos Papdopoulos looks like exactly what we need.  Skrtel could very well be on his way out. I don't know how I feel about Skrtel; I like him but there's a reason he was dropped and then couldn't get back in the side. If he was sold, I wouldn't be too disappointed.  KP (as he will now be known), is younger, stronger and more of a physical presence.  Hopefully his knees will hold up, and if they do, I'm sure he'll be a revelation for us.

Next year, if all goes to plan, we could have Johnson, Agger, KP and Enrique (or a new LB) on the pitch with Toure, Ilori, Kelly, Wisdom as backup.

If Skrtel **and** Coates leave (again, honestly, I'd wouldn't be too upset), we'd definitely need these three signings.  If talk of a new LB is true, that's 4 defensive additions to the squad; a fantastic summer of business in my opinion.",0,1369163200,null,0,false,0,ca3724c,t3_1errn3,t1_ca3724c,t3_1errn3,null,1431081695,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

This is without a doubt the next Modric. Most likely out of our price range and on the way to city but I think it would still be worth a 20m bid (latest rumours have him to city for 17m). He would slide seamlessly in the squad whether we are playing 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1. I think it is no exageration to say this guy will be as good as Mata when he finally hits the EPL.

&gt;Steffan Kießling

Linked to an EPL move in the winter this guy is a proven goal scorer. He has topped the Bundesliga goal scoring tally (topping Lewandowski, Huntelaar etc) with 25 goals in 34 matches this season. This is also in no way a breakout season for him either having scored at a consistent rate of .62 goals a game for the last 4 (yes 4) years. The best part, he is rated at under 10m with rumours that he could go for as low as 6m to play in the EPL. This guy could be the goal scoring stepping stone spurs need until players like Coulibaly and Kane are developed further.


&gt;Vydra

Younger and further along then many of our best youth strikers. This guy at 21 years of age was the championships best striker last season with 20 goals in 41 appearances, he also scored 2 goals in 4 at international level. He could probably be Levy'd for under 5m with the intention of sticking him on a 1-2 year EPL loan to a team like Norwich.

&gt;The classified document, which the Met withheld from the Leveson Inquiry until after it could have been usefully raised in the public hearings, suggested the officer — who is not named for legal reasons —passed the leak on to the tabloid for money.

This is certainly not so in insurance industries as insurance companies do not take risks on such scales, all of their models are so that they do not lose. The problem was an insufficient model being applied, resulting them in not knowing, rather than taking, the risks.

In the case of the car industry (which were mostly just free loans of which they were paid back), was a deficient business strategy, not that they were taking huge risks.

There is a massive difference between simply a failing company that the government decides to bailout, and moral hazard where a business knows the government has no effective choice but to bail them out.

People with [heterochromia](http://wordpress.mrreid.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/heterochromia-girl.jpg) aren't normal either by one definition but we don't go around saying that their lack of normalness inherently makes them immoral or whatever, and conversely we shouldn't say that normal equates to good (It's pretty easy to think of things that were once normal that are incredibly immoral). In fact, I don't know why gay-rights campaigners are so keen on saying that homosexuality is normal, what they really should be saying is something like ""Assuming homosexuality isn't normal, so what? What's your point?""

November is 6-7 months ago. He had some of the best doctors/trainers/fitness coaches in the world helping him recover as much as he could BEFORE he came back, let alone these past 6 or so months. I know injuries take time but at the level these guys play at, even miniscule drops in ability/quickness/whatever are evident.

Gomez did well enough for Germany in 2012, for sure. I honestly really shouldn't have brought that up because it's a moot point. Torres was the Golden Boot winner of that tourney (tied with Gomez on goals and assists but having much less time played) so it's tough to really judge what is relevant and what is not. Klose scored in the only game he started in the tournament so who is better? Who knows.

Bottom line is this:

Gomez is still a top 15 striker. Gomez is equal or a little better than the options we currently have. While I wouldn't be burning my CFC jerseys if we signed him, far from it, I would be a bit peeved because I think there are other options out there that fit us better. I think Gomez should be the starter for Bayern, frankly. Assuming Pep doesn't blow up the entire squad he's the ideal target man for the style that they play. Then again, if he goes with the tiki-taka then Gomez is gone because he's a pretty poor passer of the ball.

I just don't think he's enough of an upgrade for us to go out and get him. He's too similar to what we have now. He's fantastic at getting into open spaces and using his big body but he gives the ball away a frustrating amount and we desperately need a striker who can hold up the ball to allow our other players to join in the attack and run in behind those defenders to open up the field for our midfield maestro's. He's a poacher and we've already got one of those.

Begovic does top Pepe with a 71% save percentage to his 68%, but that is such a small difference, especially for the hype that Begovic has gotten this year.

Stoke is absolutely set up to defend, by the way, and their CBs are some of the most statistically impressive in the league.

Probably the most pressing concern right now, the left back position where Assou-Ekotto has suffered a small decline over the past season. Criscito offers us an internationally-capped, proven wing-back who is better than existing options on both defense and attack.

With Joao Moutinho apparently fluttering his lashes towards the riches of *nouveau-riche* Monaco, a pass-first midfielder that can play the 4-3-3 system in the ilk of Clasie or Strootman would give added penetration and control the tempo of the game, which we tend to have issues with at times. A diminutive midfielder who has a primary focus of linking up play and building attacks a-la-Xavi, played with Dembele and Sandro, would provide AVB with the vacuum in midfield to recycle and retain possession.

true,TheEvilScotsman,scottish,Scotland,"Oh marriage is of course a highly traditional institution which has changed greatly from its early days. It used to be all about familial alliances, then came to be about sexual partners (and you were a demon for having it outside marriage, particularly for women), but then of course it has morphed again into being considered some bedrock for society, but what does it actually do? Marriage enshrines social privilege through legality, various tax exemptions and such, as well as insurance, inheritance and next-of-kin, maybe even power of attorney?, I'm not fully sure the ins and outs: the point is marriage is a legal institution which has come to be about love.

This means that the gay marriage issue is one of people in gay marriages gaining the same benefits that straight people have available to them, in an institution which is now about love. 

I don't tend to get very aggressive about it because I can't really see the future so it doesn't presently effect me much.

This has gradually been reduced in many member states. In most countries, parcels, publications and printed media materials were never part of this reserved area and so have always had competition. The UK has had privately owned couriers and express services for many, many years.

Market opening in the UK started with bulk mail in the early 2000s and then progressed to full market opening in 2006. The privatisation of Royal Mail was attempted by the labour government in 2009 with the Postal Services Bill which did not get passed. In 2011, a new Postal Services Act was passed which made provision for the privatisation of Royal Mail. The Act you link to above is the 2000 Act, which has since been superseded.

Yes, I know he got hurt and got benched behind a hot Mandzukic (who ended up scoring 20 in 37 games played, not exactly mind-blowing) but it's not like he joined a new team and didn't have the time to gel with his teammates. He had essentially the same core of players around him this season as when he put up those impressive numbers in seasons past. Yeah, you have to shake a bit of rust off and a slight drop-off is expected but at the end of the day the players who provided him service to score were basically the same. He's played and practiced with a lot of the same players (especially the players on the DFB) for the majority of his career. If his production is dropping with them then what would it do with an entirely new squad/coach/philosophy/league/etc? It's not like we would have years to develop him anyways. He'd need to make an immediate impact and I'm not sure he can. 

Mind you, this was also in a year that Bayern steamrolled every team they played, bar none, and had very little competition in the league. With the amount of quality that team posses relative to the other teams in it's league, a decent drop-off in production should be a concern. They were seemingly scoring at will in some games against teams of far inferior quality.

&gt; You might as well say 'Apart from millions of pounds that are the difference between living an almost third world life and a first world life, for nothing in return, what do urban areas provide the countryside?'

Your attitude is laughable, but if you think we provide nothing then we'll set up borders around all major towns and cities and see how you get on.

No airspace for any city-based airports, no food, no water supply, no land for road or rail links between your fiefdoms, in many cases no access to the sea, etc. We'll take all of the power plants that aren't based in an urban area too - which is rather a lot of them. How will you get on without basic necessities and lack of transport? Being landlocked would be terrible. You won't have internet or telephone connectivity outside of your city because the cables run into the countryside. You could use satellite, I guess.

You seem obsessed with the idea that everyone who doesn't live in an urban area must be some sort of sponger. Dream on.

&gt; If it weren't for people in urban areas subsidising rural areas you would have no school, no buses, few doctors, no hospitals, no police etc. I don't disagree that you provide a service in return for money, but so does everyone else.

And you wouldn't have many of the things that you need, either. Perhaps you should resign yourself to the fact that urban areas can't exist on their own?

&gt; In any case you haven't said why it is an inalienable right for you to get post at the expense of other people. Why can't rural areas have severely reduced rounds, say delivery once every week?

I never said it because I don't care. I merely asked why you assume everyone who lives in the country does so by choice. I didn't ask about the logistics of a postal system.

I repeat - do you live in London (basically the only self sufficient part of the country)? Everyone else is being subsidised to some extent. You wouldn't want to be a hypocrite now, would you? I hope you don't claim tax reliefs or benefits or any other publicly funded service to the point where someone else is subsidising you.",0,1369169217,null,0,1369170055,0,ca39icl,t3_1er6m6,t1_ca39icl,t1_ca39ec0,null,1431080467,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

While its a fair enough definition what it doesn't tell you is the situation they were in. Could the player have been shoved from behind while shooting and missed? Could the player have been off balanced when taking the shot for whatever reason? Could the goal keeper have made an unbelievable save? Could the player have had a free header but whoever crossed it hit it too high/long causing the player to not head the ball cleanly? I think all of those are valid ways in which this ""clear-cut chances missed"" metric could appear inflated.

After a half hour lecture I worked out this was pretty much a big game of rounders so the guys were impressed how quickly I grasped their rules, asked some questions relating Baseball to Cricket enthusiastically and got nothing but yank laughs but was determined to make an effort with it.

Honestly can't really remember an event from the first innings just how the atmosphere died I could actually hear the fielders talking for fucks sake! Innings became repetitive to watch and with so many of them I lost interest. As you said the crowd are noisiest during breaks can't blame them to be honest, so I joined them by drinking shit beer, chatting shit and eating shit. All waiting for the interactive entertainment breaks where people acting crazy or funny get shown on the big screen, each break I let go even more allowing myself to be consumed in American culture I was living the dream and determined to get on that TV!

It's basically just a pissup, most the fans weren't even watching the game, had terrible knowledge of their team and the fact the majority of these men are ok with that is rather pathetic.

That being said, after learning the author of the article also wrote the book on *Barca being the greatest team in the world*, I had to leave my door open to the possibility of some *cule* bias.    
  
I do agree that Mous reign at Madrid wasn't the greatest in his career, but what do you expect of brand new galacticos regime, a new team that had to win against Peps homegrown Barca? Mou's scorched earth policy is also due to the demands put forth by the clubs that hire him, again what do you expect from a man who has many titles in many countries? Wegnernomics? Please.    
  
I will commend the predictions made by tiki, that is Mourinho explained to a T. Mes Que Un Club, they'll run how they see fit.

His media antics should be of no surprise, and Mou wouldn't be the type just sit there and be sacked, he probably learned after being cut the deepest by Chelsea. Let Madrid have their ""relief"". Wegner Voyeur. Uefa Handcuffs. how could you not see it coming? From the king of da Bantz himself.

Mou style is to instill a mentality and change a player to bring the best out of them, see Inter's revival of Sneijder and Milito. Madrid arguably already had world class players with their own mindset, the NBA fan in me would compare to the situation in Miami.

Let Mou go. To be honest I don't think it would make a difference to Galacticos Madrid, and I think Carlo is the best option for them, I dream of a 2005 Milan revival. Mou needs a young team to instill a mentality and bring out the best in them, with the luxury of a checkbook.

Who else but Chelsea?

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;The thing with desiring a culture where sexuality is chaneled down specific reproduction orientated paths is that it doesn't quite fit the reality that sexuality is not about just reproduction.

Well on a genetic level to some extent it might be (no, I suppose not, clearly humans use sex for other reasons like dominating conquered enemies and cementing social bonds within groups :P).

But plenty of societies get by fine without a libertine attitude to sexuality, just as plenty get by fine with a libertine attitude to sexuality. Because either way seems to work ok it just seems to come down to aesthetics to me.

If men and women didn't have sex, society would die out within a generation. But if men and men didn't or women and women didn't then some picky people would experience sexual frustration. It's clearly a different level of effect. In terms of the marriage issue in a society where homosexuality is basically socially accepted it's even less significant.

And I am not saying that means we shouldn't legalise gay marriage, if society wants to indulge in such decadent trivialities due to a lack of real existential threats (although, ahem, climate change, resource depletion, shifting global power balance etc) to keep them entertained that's for society to decide and to do.

I agree with what you said about the GI not being scary. The Power of Three's villain (Shakri) wasn't either, it was just thrown in there....though that episode wasn't really about the villain. It was to show how Amy and Rory's relationship with The Doctor changed their everyday lives, and it did accomplish that. But yeah, unless they revisit it, not the best villain. Meanwhile some of the bad villains had a lot of potential, but just didn't live up to expectations. The Whisper Men, for example, could have been really terrifying but they didn't do much. And the sentinel things in RoA that whispered ""Merry"" when they were looking for the little girl? Those were scarier than the jack-o-lantern planet, and I wish they had been explored more. But instead they were easily held back and just vanished when the planet awoke.

Other episodes had twists on their villains, but they didn't always work. The GI being the true villain was an interesting twist in The Bells of St. John, but I was never really afraid of the human villains of that episode and by the time we knew it was the GI it was already defeated. And in In Journey to the Center of the Tardis we had the burned-up future people, but that episode wasn't really about the villains so I won't complain about that. You could argue that the salvage team was an evil force at times, but they were hardly a danger to The Doctor or Clara.     
However in A Town Called Mercy I liked the question of ""who's really evil here?"" and I thought it was well done. So that was a good one. ""Hide"" had a twist of there being no villain, and honestly I enjoyed that episode. Not sure how I feel about the Crooked Man and his Juliet just hanging around 1970's England but they weren't truly evil so I guess that's okay. I was afraid of the villain until the twist was revealed, so I'd consider that a solid episode on that front as well. 

Also it's worth mentioning that the season had some solid villains: The Daleks and Angels, obviously. Solomon and Mrs. Gillywater (not so much Mr. Sweet) were definitely good. The Ice Warrior was a scary villain during the episode, but not my favorite. And the Cybermen being able to adapt so quickly made them scarier, but Matt Smith's Evil Doctor stole the show in a good way. So the season was not entirely lacking in good villains.

TL;DR: The season had *some* good villains. And some not-always-well-executed twist villains. And some episodes where the villain wasn't supposed to be the focus. And some outright bad villains.   
I think it has less to do with the villains and more to do with how they're used in reference to the plot. In some cases it came up subpar.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"I don't really know where to begin but I suppose I can start by saying that your main criticism is incredibly flawed. You're criticizing an apple for not being an orange.

Dembele, believe it or not, is not an incisive passer--at least not primarily. He is not Luka Modric or Juan Mata. He is a well-rounded box-to-box midfielder. A jack of all trades but a master of none (except maybe dribbling). That is his game. He is not a 19 year old in the early stages of development; he is a player with an established style and what we saw was what we were going to get. He has never been a prolific goalscorer or a creator, in spite of playing more forward earlier in his career. You can hope for him to improve his incisive passing all you want, but it's not reasonable. 

If someone complained that Tom Huddlestone doesn't surge forward with the ball enough, wouldn't you find that a bit silly? If someone criticized Luka Modric for not winning the ball back enough the poster would get rightly crucified here. 

But let's do what you suggested and look at his personal contribution compared to the top central midfielders from other clubs. Warning: there will be a lot of stats here because it's pointless and misleading to look at just a few.

So looking at this data it becomes clear that while Dembele doesn't really do any one thing as well as the best in the league, he has a total array of contributions that is only really exceeded by Steven Gerrard (who quietly had an absolutely incredible season and blows everyone on this list away IMO). He's certainly not being outclassed by any of these players, both with the eye test and in the numbers. 

For example, Yaya Toure might make his team tick better (bearing in mind his team averages 5% more possession per game than us) and score more goals, but he doesn't create as many chances, doesn't dribble as much, and doesn't win the ball back as often.

Jack Wilshere might create more chances and drive forward more but he's not as tidy with the ball and doesn't win it back as often.  

Really the only thing I will give you is that Mousa fouls more than he needs to. Beyond that I think he's been immense. One of the top 5 central midfielders in the division and one of the most complete players at his position as well.

All of this is without quantifying how losing Sandro changed the dynamic of our team or the fact that Mousa has been playing hurt for large portions of the season. 

**TL;DR:** If Mousa played the way you seem to think he can (he can't) he wouldn't be playing at Spurs.

You are absolutely correct, a GPs receptionist is not a qualified person to triage you. That is why you should not let them. If you are ill and require an appointment then request an emergency appointment - you will then either be triaged by a doctor or nurse. Every GPs I've encountered has some form of emergency appointment system, so you need to say about that. If they say they can't give you that then I'm sorry, you tell them you NEED to see a Doctor. If your GP practice doesn't do this then put in an official complaint or move GPs. Remember, if you don't say to the Practice then they won't know and can't take action.

Aspiring to have the same institutions as straights is a form of capitulation as you're implying that straight values and institutions are the ones that are truly legitimate.

I'm not gay myself, so I realise you may not care what I think, but that sounds the sort of thing that activists of the sort of radical persuasion would say...  Fair play to them, they fought the fight when it was even harder than today, and won their victories.  But their victory is that many more gay people from all walks of life and political persuasions feel able to stand up and be counted.  Not the right to dictate to these people what their aspirations should be.  That these aspirations are more mainstream is inevitable I would say.

I got into an interesting discussion on historical sexuality a while back, and a point made was that homosexuality as an identity is fairly recent, and might be seen as a reaction to prejudice and a means of organising to fight it, rather than something set in stone.  When, finally, we get to the point where this prejudice has faded away, will anyone feel the need to be gay any more?

My point is that disgust towards the act of gay sex isn't innate, it is learned, because there is an advanced (read - post infant) element of comprehension required and no-one is born with it. If disgust towards it is a learned behaviour based on comprehension of the act, then it is reasonable to demand a standard of rationale, which I don't think people can provide because I don't think it exists. I comprehend straight sex; it doesn't appeal to me, but I am not disgusted, therefore it is possible to comprehend sexual acts that do not appeal to oneself and not be disgusted by them. I just think people should hold themselves to the same logical standard.

**Pierre Emerick Aubameyang**:  Still young (23)Good size (6'2""), has good pace and quickness. He notched 19 goals in 32 games this season. Can be the featured striker in the middle but has the pace to go out wide if need be. Tough part is that rumor is we pissed him off last summer in how we handled his recruitment.  Hopefully AVB being established (and rumors of a contract extension) and a 12-16m bid would let us land him. 

**Jordy Claise** Tough little CM with a good sense of how to create opportunities. Is fantastic on the ball and has great vision, like a bizarre combination of Parker and Modric though (at this point) not quite on the level of either.  He's very good at being the deep lying CM who can unlock defenses and allow someone like Mousa be more of a threat near the box.  Seen rumors that he could go in the 8-10m range which fits our budget profile.

**Matej Vydra** Young (21), showed a good knack of finding the back of the net for Watford.

If everyone accuses those who oppose mixed race marriage as racist then it detracts from any sincere discourse and debate an issue like this deserves. Loughton's proposal for equality for civil partnerships for blacks wanting to marry whites has already been derailed because people (wrongly) attached a racist label to it.




It really is that simple - those opposed to marital equality really are on the wrong side of history, so much so, it's embarrassing to hear them defend their point of view.

That's not to say that it won't evolve over time but the needs of users over time will also evolve - as the people that rely on and particularly value post are generally older, it's only a matter of time until the majority of the current minimum requirements of the USO are less relevant to the majority of consumers. The exception to this is in the bulkier items, which is why Royal Mail are often the only option for delivering distance shopping goods to places like the Highlands and Islands. Other couriers charge extra or don't deliver to these places, but Royal Mail are going there anyway and their network is set up to reach these places so it's comparatively more cost effective. And there's nothing stopping them putting prices for these items up (as you might have seen with the recent format and price changes for parcel products) as they'll still tick the USO box if the prices are uniform. So the delivery from Leeds to Bradford costs the same and subsidises the delivery from Padstow to Lerwick. If Royal Mail is run by a private firm, I'm pretty sure they'll make sure that each product is profitable in itself, which doesn't mean a reduced USO, it means higher prices.

The USO as currently specified requires the provision of a basic parcel product up to 20kg, so the majority of parcels handled by Royal Mail are inseparable from the USO. And this is the area that costs the most - flat items up to A4 are all mechanised and cost far less to process in high volumes. The problem is that the easily mechanised mail is in decline, while the parcels that need space and man power to manually handle are increasing in volume. 
Royal Mail is the designated universal service provider in the UK because it is the only operator capable of providing that service. If Royal Mail is bought by a private company, that won't change.

The Act was changed by the [Civil Partnerships Act](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/33/schedule/27/paragraph/13#schedule-27-paragraph-13-1) to cover a marriage between any person and any person in an excluded category. So Norman Tebbit is wrong.*]

I was bad and didn't do any research before commenting... so after a bit of reading:

There doesn't seem to be much case law on this part of the Interpretation Act, but there's on [House of Lords case from 2005](http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2005/30.html); there a man whose wife had died brought a challenge to a law that gave tax relief to widows but not widowers (i.e. women whose husbands had died but not men whose wives had died).

The House of Lords found that the law was discriminatory and incompatible with the Human Rights Act (but thought the correct response was to remove the benefit for widows, rather than also grant it to widowers), but one of the arguments as to why this wasn't the case was that it could be read, using the Interpretation Act, as applying equally to men as it did to women (combined with the general requirement of interpreting laws compatibly with the ECHR in s3 HRA).

Lord Hoffman didn't accept this, he felt that the law was clear enough that there was an intention to *only* refer to widows (particularly as in other places it used words like ""spouse"" or ""individual"" where it needed to cover both men and women, and some places specifically referred to things applying to widows as to widowers).

So does the Marriage Act demonstrate such a clear intention? Possibly; it gives specific lists for men and women. On the other hand, there isn't necessarily the same level of references elsewhere in the Act. On top of that, there's an argument that Parliament wouldn't have conceived of the possibility of a man marrying his son, so their intention wasn't to ""allow"" it (by not explicitly banning it).

Given the public policy implications, a combination of s6 IA, s3 HRA and discrimination laws might be enough to convince a court to agree. It's a point that I'd be happy to argue (either way) if it ever went to court (I imagine a case would be unlikely to be decided on that point - not many people try to marry their relatives and if it was done as a test case the marriage might get thrown out on the grounds of being a sham).

But, of course, it would be far cheaper to include an explicit clause in the Bill dealing with it. So... I sort of agree with Norman Tebbit there. But my solution is to fix the Bill, rather than keep discriminating against people who love/want to marry people who aren't of the opposite legal sex.",0,1369179176,null,0,1369179635,0,ca3d7fb,t3_1es1rm,t1_ca3d7fb,t1_ca3bufy,null,1431078725,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;No, I literally feel that a statistic on a player's dribbling tells you nothing about that player's dribbling.

Was that sarcasm because you go on to completely contradict yourself? Also I never said watching a player wasn't a better indication but most people don't watch a player enough to form a valid opinion on a player. Stats are a handy representation of key facets of a players game and whilst they fall short of telling the whole story they certainly can be used to determine certain positional qualities.

With the inventories, both tenant and landlord should receive a copy. Some agencies charge the landlord, some the tenant. Either way, if you disagree with it, raise your concern about it. Time Stamped photos (there's an app to do it now as well) do well to show the state of the property when you arrived.

true,selorn,tennant,Tennant,"&gt;It just feels like this idea of him being a monster is being shoved down my throat courtesy of Moffat. 

1. RTD was the one who came up with the nicknames you listed in the beginning, and made the Doctor's dark side a bigger deal again.   Why automatically blame Moffat?

2. The whole ""The Doctor is not actually a very nice guy""-thing comes straight from Episode 1, where he pretty much kidnaps two high school teachers for finding the TARDIS.    It's been explored before, to an extent in the Sixth Doctor's stories(see: The Valeyard, The Trial of A Time Lord), and more properly in the Seventh Doctor's stories, where he's not at all unafraid to toy with Ace to further his strategies.

3. You admit that he needs a companion to keep him in check...how is it hard to see his potential to be a monster, then?   Because you feel compassion for him?  You might feel compassion for Frankenstein's Monster as well, or a Vampire, but that doesn't negate the fact that they have inclinations towards monstrous activities.   The Doctor is, honestly, very much the same way.   He literally has the power to do just about anything, and has misused it several times.

There's the concept of 'that which contains an image of an angel becomes, itself, an angel' which seems to say that copies of angels are just as real as the originals. There's the two worlds in Amy's Choice. And then of course there's auton-Rory in the s5 finale.

And then s6 is where the theme becomes super noticeable. You have the flesh and ganger-Amy and ganger-Doctor, the Teselecta, the two Doctors in Impossible Astronaut, old!Amy and regular Amy in Girl who Waited, and then stuff again in the finale.

And then in s7 you have lots of Clara, and to some extent the snowmen.

true,danfeen,flair8,,"**Christian Benteke**

 I think he is exactly the kind of powerful, skilful and young striker that we need. He would cost close to £20 million probably. 

**James McCarthy**

 a versatile young midfielder, good going forward and strong in the tackle. 

**A left back**

I'm finding it hard to pick any in particular. **Domenico Criscito** has been touted by a lot of people, and the little I've seen of him he's been very good. Would he leave Champions League football to join us? Maybe. There's also the option of giving **Danny Rose** a shot as a regular. If **Rose** does stay and get his chance then that leaves room for another signing.

**Tom Ince**

Since Bale's move inside, we have lacked someone who can run down the left wing and put in a cross and score a goal. He has something like 18 goals and 14 assists this season, which even in the Championship is phenomenal for a 21 year old. I'd actually put this higher in priority than a left back now but can't be arsed to re-edit.

All are young, not ridiculously priced and play for teams considered lower than Tottenham (maybe not Criscito) so are definitely quite realistic and offer solutions to the main problems that affected Spurs this season.

The entire tone of your post is something like a full on fan-girl or something similar. You appear to have hugely romanticised the concept of the UK and what it means to live here. I'd like to think this is not the case but I hope your idea of the UK is more developed than the tea, crumpets, Dr Who and Harry Potter... 

As for your questions, it really depends on how you are coming here, and how you plan to support yourself. London isn't much fun if you can't fund yourself but if your personal interests are quite 'niche' then it may offer the best opportunities to meet other people with similar interests. 

If however you are just going to come over in hopes of getting work, then you'll want to go somewhere else cheaper. Nothing comes to mind off the top of my head that is likely to have plenty job opportunities and cheap living options but potentially some of the smaller cities, anywhere that isn't London.

true,narthgir,null,null,"The system is favoured for tenants, but most agencies try to blitz you on your first complaint on the chance that you will immediately give up. It's a tactic used against vulnerable people, so I'm happy it's biased to tenants.

My previous agency tried to charge me for things which had happened while I was there, they were aware of, fixed, and admitted at the time were their fault (bad piping job in bathroom caused a leak and ceiling below collapsed). They were actually making a claim higher than my full 6 week deposit! I complained and their immediate response was to say everything was correct, they had no record of repairs, all my complaints were wrong and that we could either settle at a lower amount or it would have to go to the DPS (which they kindly advised me could take several weeks... in other words *hint hint don't fight us or you won't get the money for ages*).

Thankfully, even though it was all done over the phone, I had the sense to send one token email at the time and used it as proof for the DPS. Imagine if I didn't have that mail?

I'm not going to take that sort of rubbish, but there are plenty of meeker people, or people confused by beaurocracy, or people scared of having bad references etc that they prey on. I've seen it time and again, they try to target people who don't understand the rules, or aren't good at standing up for themselves. So from that point of view it is good that it is biased for tenants.

As for my bad experiences, I've had two, in both my rentals in London. First one tried to charge me £800 (new price, they showed the receipt) for a 8 year old couch with some damage on it. Never mind that there was only damage to one arm, they maintained they hadn;t heard of depreciation. In their world, that couch is worth £800 forever. It's that level of stupidity that annoys me most. I will happily pay for damage if I have caused it, but to think an 8 year old couch was worth its new price was just stupid beyond belief... or was it? How many other people got caught out by stuff like that? Nothing to lose from trying and hundreds of pounds to gain the few times you succeed.

Next was that 90% of the couch was fine, I would pay for repairs or a token sum to contribute to the loss in value... they said no, it's full or we go to dispute. As soon as I said if I was paying full depreciated value, I wanted the couch to bring with me to my new place, they suddenly were willing to settle way lower... I wonder why? Could it be that the damage was so small they would never replace it and they were just going to keep the money?

Same place, £30 for a dent to a door (which was there when we moved in but not in checkout report and we didn't take pics in first flat... so tough shit on us, but we learned). 3 months later I had cause to go back there, dent still in door. Everyone involved knew they weren't ever fixing that door, it's just easy money for them - it's a scam. They let their places fall to shite and pick up cash along the way. Eventually they sell and some other sucker comes in, does it al up and rinse and repeat.

It's anecdotal, but I have yet to meet anyone who has had a good experience with rental agencies in London. They are all shit, and can afford to be because demand is so high. Perhaps elsewhere in the UK it's better, but in London if you want to live somewhere decent you can't shop around - you don't have the luxury of waiting for a flat with a preferred agency &amp; if you see a nice place, you better snap it up.

He'll yell, organise and take charge of his backline the way no 21-year-old should be expected to. 

In terms of playstyle, he's very physical. He'll make the last-ditch tackles, but he seems more able to close down moves up the pitch and block attempts than, say, Coates. He's also excellent in the air, and decent with the ball at his feet. A good threat from set-pieces, too. He's turned down moves to bigger clubs in the past because it wasn't the right time in his career to join a team with lots of pressure and little playtime, so he has a good head on his shoulders. He's also been playing senior football for several years now, so he's got the mental strength to play at the top level. Overall, he'd be an excellent purchase - which is why I'm skeptical of this move being completed, and will remain so until he gets his medical.

In terms of his weaknesses, he *is* still inexperienced - he's very mature for his age, but he still makes some mistakes and fouls more than he should. He might be a little *too* fond of tackling. There's also the major issue of his knee surgery - his spell out of the game has already been extended, and if there's any complications it could seriously jeopardize his career and development. Having not played in months, he's also likely to be a bit rusty, even with a good pre-season under his belt.

If he can pass a medical, he'll be an excellent player for  Schalke, or anyone else he joins. Definitely a player I'm happy to see Liverpool targeting, even if we can't sign him.

You're a viewer of the show, looking into the Doctor from the most sympathetic possible viewpoint, which is that of the people he cares most about. 

The Doctor casually decides who deserves to live and who deserves to die, based entirely on his own standards. He'll destroy the last remnant of a species if they don't accept his terms and conditions for their survival, which may or may not seem reasonable, depending on who you are. I had a decent bit of sympathy for several species that the Doctor genocided, so I can understand the ""monster"" thing.

The Doctor claims the moral high ground, but has personally ended more species than most other civilizations manage.

I certainly wouldn't be surprised if it turned out otherwise, for your reasoning, but that's the theory I have.  Again, that's just the way I took it.

But honestly, on a different note, when my friends and I were talking about it, we did go over the fact that he's supposed to be in his ENTIRE timeline at that moment, so potentially his future incarnations are in that place as well.  I figured it was a past one though because of his line about them all beings his ghosts, and Clara's line about seeing all 11 of his faces.

true,EveryGoodNameIsGone,mcgann,McGann,"Everything else has been explained to the best of my knowledge already, so here's my take on that last one:

The ""button"" is the control for the magno-grab device - the thing that crashed the TARDIS in the first place. From *the button's* point of view, here's what happened:

1. Salvagers press button, TARDIS crashes
2. Doctor meets salvagers, takes button from them and recognizes it for what it is, but it's too late for it to do anything with since the TARDIS has already crashed; he pockets it then mostly forgets it's there
3. Events of most of the episode happen; the Doctor and Clara find the crack and the Doctor reads the words on Clara's palm
4. The Doctor carves the words ""BIG FRIENDLY BUTTON"" into it with his sonic screwdriver (it has a laser on it in its second-ever appearance in 1968 so that's not much of a stretch) and goes through the time crack
5. The Doctor emerges from the time crack before the TARDIS had completely crashed and throws the button in, while telling his past self what's happening; we're now at the beginning of the episode, but there are two branching points here
6. Timeline A (beginning of the episode; timeline in which most of the episode takes place): Clara sees the button rolling on the TARDIS floor, she picks it up, burns her hand, drops it and forgets about it, then the rest of the episode happens
7. Timeline B (the end of the episode), the Doctor listens to his future self and manages to get to the button quickly enough to turn it off, thus releasing the magno-grab's hold on the TARDIS and allowing them to elude the salvagers entirely. The TARDIS is never captured, and the events of most of the episode are erased (though the Doctor probably remembers everything from Timeline A once it is erased, Clara doesn't regain her memories)

Voila! It didn't put itself into creation, it was the control for the device that the salvagers used to trap the TARDIS. Why turning the future copy of it off in the past while the past version is working successfully turns both off is beyond me, but hey, it's *Doctor Who*, weird shit like that happens!

I really don't know why the brother is nicer at the end; the implication is that, even though Timeline A never happened now, its events still managed to have an effect in Timeline B. What confuses me more is why the picture of the family is torn (not-cyborg is not present) in the beginning of the episode, but intact at the end...",0,1369190596,null,0,1369190862,0,ca3hbay,t3_1esxad,t1_ca3hbay,t3_1esxad,null,1431076721,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Nope, and they never will be. It's completely up to the discretion of individual priests to decide if they are willing to marry a couple or not. Most clergymen will refuse to marry someone whom they consider to be the guilty party in a previous divorce, for example. A priest can't be prosecuted for refusing to marry a couple, no matter what his or her reason might be. A priest that refused to marry an interracial couple would have his arse kicked by their bishop, but would be within the law.

She's wrong. 

At this particular moment in her timeline she's going through a particularly rough patch where the Doctor is not only growing younger with every visit but also *falling out of love with her* (in reverse). She doesn't know her future and she doesn't know what's going to happen: It's possible that all the good times in the relationship are in the past for her.

It's possible, but it's not true. And we, as the audience, know it's not true from the first time we meet River: She tells us that immediately before the events in ""Silence in the Library"" she was taken to Derillium by the Doctor ""looking older than he'd ever looked before"".

We have two brilliant midfielders in Sandro and Dembélé, but we need more creativity and more goals. Rakitic can provide both, with 8 goals and 9 assists in La Liga this season. He's 25, so would have some sell-on value, and could probably be had in the region of £10-12m. Alternative: Beñat (Real Betis)



**Lamela** - RW (Roma)

Might be a bit of a stretch financially, but if we splash on one player this offseason it should be Érik Lamela. At just 21, the Argentine international banged in 15 goals in 33 appearances from the wing. If AVB wants to switch to 4-3-3 next season, we will need a more goal-oriented winger than Lennon. Lamela fits the bill, and though he would probably be a record signing at about £25m, he would likely increase that value very quickly at Spurs. Alternative: Aubameyang (Saint Etienne)



**Soldado** - ST (Valencia)

We desperately need a proven striker with creativity and good hold-up play, but who isn't in the CL and won't cost a mint. If Valencia remain in fifth place in La Liga, Soldado may be that striker. His record is impeccable - 21 goals in 33 this season and 57 in 99 for Valencia - and with his club in financial trouble (especially if they miss CL money) he could be available for a cut price.

I would guess that I know exactly how he'll wriggle out of it. Section 28 was about the ""promotion of homosexuality"" as a ""pretended family relationship"".

In effect, this meant that local councils couldn't put picture books in their libraries, of the kind about Billy and his two dads, for the benefit of confused little kids who were in exactly that situation.

true,hamlet9000,mcgann,McGann,"1. The lava people are the Doctor, Clara, and the salvagers (who, in the future, were all burnt up in the Eye of Harmony). Why does this turn them into murderous lava people? Bad writing.

2. ""Time will reassert itself"" means that the writer is really, really bad. He appears to think that a time traveler who knows that he will be shot in the heart can avoid being killed if he arranges it so that he is instead shot in the head. (Or, in this case, ""you won't get burnt to a crisp as long as you don't touch each other, because in one possible future you were burnt to a crisp while touching each other"".)

3. The motivation for the lava creatures is bad writing.

4. It's a well-established tenet of Moffat's run that people (particularly people who have experienced time travel) can remember things from alternative timelines that have been wiped out. Same principle applies here: The alternate timeline has been wiped out, but lessons learned there have lingered.

The next logical follow-up, however, is to ask: Why has the photograph been repaired? That answer to that is, once again, bad writing.

5. The type of paradox you're referring to is known as the ""bootstrap paradox"". It's a temporal paradox in which information appears to create itself. It's a common trope of time travel fiction and can be used to great effectiveness. (It can also, of course, be used in completely moronic ways.)

The ""Big Friendly Button"", however, is not a bootstrap paradox. It is, instead, the result of iterative changes through multiple loops of time. Let me break that down a bit:

In the original timeline (which we never actually see in this episode), the BFB never appears in the control room and Clara doesn't burn her hand. The Doctor confiscates the magna-tron controller and puts it in his pocket. Much later, he and Clara are standing in the engine room and they discover that it's been time-locked in mid-explosion. He's not sure what to do and he spends a lot of time (much longer than what we eventually see) thinking about it. Eventually he empties his pockets, finds the remote control, and realizes there's a solution. He tracks down the crack-in-time, writes ""Big Friendly Button"" on the controller, and then *tosses the controller through the crack*.

In the second timeline (which is what makes up the bulk of the episode we actually see), the BFB from the original timeline comes bouncing through the rift. Clara picks it up and burns her hand. The rest of the timeline is pretty much identical, but when they reach the time-locked control room, the Doctor sees the burn on Clara's hand and quickly figures out what his predecessor figures out. He also realizes that it didn't work. He says: ""I've thrown this through the rift before. I'll have to take it through myself."" Which he then proceeds to do.

In the third timeline (which we see at the end of the episode), the Doctor from the second timeline and the BFB come through the crack. The Doctor from the second timeline tells his predecessor to push the button. His predecessor does.

true,whistling_unicorn,null,null,"OK, when I was a kid I loved castles every year we pretty much did holidays where all we did was visit castles and as a result I've been to almost all the castles in England and Wales, (although I've actually been to very few castles in Scotland, so I can't help there) but anyway here is my 2p.

Lots of castles were adapted into stately homes, your kids will probably not enjoy these castles so much. However, you probably will, for example, [Bamburgh Castle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamburgh_Castle) look like [this](http://www.tierneyphotography.co.uk/uploads/ce-cache/uploads/blog/1185/bamburgh_castle_interior_4_950_633_90.jpg) on the inside as an adult its an interesting place to vist, there are lots of stories about the wealthy families who lived there etc. however your kids will probably get bored pretty quickly. That said, the setting of Bamburgh Castle makes it one of the most famous in the country and it does still have walls and things you can run around on, but its not as good as others. (n.b. I would still highly recommend this castle, the village is also very English :) ).

At the complete other end of the spectrum are ruined castles like [Dunstanburgh Castle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunstanburgh_Castle), this is actually my favourite castle in the country, its very ruined but its remote, you have to walk for about 20 minutes to get from the ticket office to the castle. [These photos give you more of an idea of what you can expect](http://www.northofthetyne.co.uk/Dunstanburgh.html). 

For my money, the most fun castle in the country is [Caernarfon](http://www.castlewales.com/caernarf.html), you see all those small turrets? Yup, you can go up those, yup, its really really high! Snowdonia is an incredible part of the country and climbing snowdon is definitely an activity worth considering, Caernarfon is also part of a [UNESCO world heritage site](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castles_and_Town_Walls_of_King_Edward_in_Gwynedd). Another really great castle (again, you can climb all over the battlements etc.) is [Conwy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conwy_Castle), 

In the south of wales, [Caerphilly](http://www.castlewales.com/caerphil.html) is good, as is [Chepstow](http://www.castlewales.com/chepstow.html) which is another personal favourite.

If you want a castle with a moat, [Beaumaris](http://www.castlewales.com/beaumar.html) is quite good, [Bodiam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodiam_Castle) is better, [Denbigh](http://www.castlewales.com/denbigh.html) is good too no water in the moat though, and [Chirk](http://www.castlewales.com/chirk.html) is a good castle, but its a stately home one...

If you make it down to Cornwall (which I expect you won't, but if you have time, you should) [Tintagel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tintagel_Castle) is a beast of a castle, the setting is unbelievable and the legends surrounding the place only make it more awesome.

Warwick castle is ok, but its not amazing and its a stately home inside. Same with Leeds castle (which isn't in leeds), Dover castle is pretty good too for a southerly castle that has ruins. 

Generally, if the castle is owned by english heritage its a ruin/original, if its owned by the national trust its a stately home to some degree and if its privately owned generally its a stately home (because its been passed down through generations so people live there) and to be honest I generally find these places charge too much for admission and they put too much effort into trying to make it into a castle themed amusement. If you compare the website for [Warwick Castle](http://www.warwick-castle.com/) to say [Tintagel](http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/tintagel-castle/) the difference in their target market becomes apparent... Having said that, lots of the castles I've mentioned are privately owned and are great! And Warick castle is good too, but parts of it are a bit like 'medieval times', in an actual castle.

Hope that's helpful, without knowing where you're going its hard to be anything but sporadic, but basically for my money the best 'castley' castes are in the North of Wales but you  should stop off in Northumbria on your way down (also roman ruins...[Vindolanda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vindolanda) is incredible, Newcastle isn't a bad city to visit either.

true,The-Darkest-Knight,num19,,"I'm actually disappointed after going through some of the options that I've seen in this thread. Really. Guys - how undervalued do you think Spurs are? Sheesh.

Let's break this down. Who are our current XI and where do we need improvements?

Lloris

Walker Kaboul Vertonghen BAE

Sandro Holtby

Dembele

Lennon Bale

Adebayor



That for me is our starting eleven. Where do I see the need for improvement? Honestly - nowhere. IF THE PLAYERS ARE IN TOP FORM AND FIT.

Which they won't be.

We keep talking about how Dembele's not playing attacking enough and how we miss Sandro defensively.

If they were doing exactly that - I'm convinced we'd have finished third. We often forget that we HAVE Sandro in our squad, we HAVE Kaboul in our squad.

And look at the bench. Holtby not working out. Dembele not working out. Lennon having a bad day. Who we got?

Sigurdsson. Dempsey. Defoe. Townsend.

Those are VERY GOOD options coming off the bench.

But wait a second, BAE at left back was horrible right, what gives? He was FINE last season, he was decent against Man City, and in his first few games before injury he was doing okay too. Is he a TOP CLASS left back? No.

So.

I'd say POSSIBLY a back-up option for that. A left back. Luke Shaw will not come. Chelsea bid like 15m or something for him and he said he'll stay at Southampton. We have Danny Rose who isn't the best left back in the world but at least he's a pacy left back that offers something down the left and has progressed with Sunderland.

The only issue I see is up front. If Ade isn't producing and if Defoe is out of touch, we need someone else around.

Three names come to my head. Loic Remy, David Villa and Christian Benteke.

They are all viable options. BUT VILLA IS ONLY 31 WTF MAN. So? He's a top class striker, one of the best in Spain, HE CAN BE OUR 25 GOAL A SEASON STRIKER. He still has two years in him.

REMY HAS GLASS KNEES GTFO. Perhaps. But for the 6-8m, he's worth it. He comes up with good goals, good shots, with the fucked up support he got from the QPR midfield he still managed goals, imagine what he'd do with the Spurs service.

Benteke, 'nuff said.

Now that I think about - the creative spark in midfield from Dembele won't be enough. Holtby has a habit of having a few bad games even though he gives it his all.

Therefore - creative midfielder in Moutinho perhaps?

Honestly, I think if we get a creative midfielder in Moutinho + a striker like Villa, we'll be good.

But you know what? EVEN IF WE DON'T - if we keep Sandro fit, if we let him, Holtby and Dembele play the diamond - if we have Kaboul around, if we can keep alternating Rose and BAE...

true,busstopboxer,null,null,"In order of priority:

**Forward**  
It would be hard to say no to signing **David Villa**. Affordable transfer fee, heaps of quality and top-level experience, perfect style of play in terms of mixing goals with subtle and effective link up play, and desperate to make a big impression playing regularly down the middle to sew up his chance of starting for Spain in what will most likely be his last World Cup next summer.

No, this isn't a buy for the future, but not everything has to be. We stand a far better chance to bringing in the perfect forward for our long-term plans next summer (or the one after) if we can offer CL football, and Villa gets us to that level right now and for the next couple of years. And adding a player of his stature to the ranks is a real statement of intent.

I think Benteke and Martinez could both be great (not to mention a certain Brazilian we don't like to talk about anymore) but I'm not sure I buy the idea that either will move this summer, despite their good seasons - how often does a player only stay at a club that wants him for only a single season? I'm betting Villa and Porto would hold firm this season against all but unsightly offers that are well beyond our means or sense. They're targets for next summer.

**Creative Midfielder**  
We'd all have to be a little silly not to want Moutinho, but that's hardly worth talking about - we all know it's just a matter of whether or not it's possible.

Assuming it's not, **Miralem Pjanić** at Roma is well worth talking about - especially seeing as it looks like we'll be bringing in Baldini who's been working with him at Roma. The guy oozes class and technique and would probably cost half of Moutinho's fee (and wages) while being several years younger. Either a perfect complement to Sandro and Dembele in a three, or a great alternative to Dembele in a two if the Belgian's out - Pjanić offers a bit more strength than others who've been touted for the role, such as Eriksson. And Roma haven't even made Europa this season, let alone CL.

Given Newcastle's season, I'd be inclined to see if we could do anything on Cabaye as an alternative - he also offers everything we're looking for at what would likely be a reasonable price, plus a valuable two years' PL experience.

**Winger/Striker**  
I think a player who can do the business as a real winger or forward should be the third on our to-acquire list. There are a few good options with the likes of Aubameyang, Bony, Son Heung-Min and Rémy, maybe even Tom Ince.

And I'd be wary of lumping together gay marriage and interracial marriage, it's a little patronising to the gay rights community to equate their struggle with the one for racial equality, simply because they're both 'different' than straight white folk. 

I wanted marriage equality. But simply steamrolling the legislation through Parliament with a 2 hour debate before hand doesn't do anyone any favors. A proper debate would not only allow a smooth passage for the bill, but allow those who are on the wrong side of history an opportunity to see their arguments dismantled and their views legitimately and respectfully challenged. And hopefully, bring them into the fold. Spain, for example, has seen no drop in public homophobia after passing gay marriage because they simply passed the legislation without any public discourse preceding or following it's passage. 

&gt;Was the rhetoric directly to blame for the attack? Probably not. But it helped make it more palatable for the instigators.

No, it probably didn't. Hate crime has been on the rise long before gay marriage was even been debated. ",0,1369203986,null,0,false,0,ca3lgyo,t3_1erwr5,t1_ca3lgyo,t1_ca3ct57,null,1431074761,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

**Scott Sinclair** I thought last summer we should have looked at Scott Sinclair to come in and play both on the wing and at forward for us in the 4-3-3. That never materialized, however this summer he is likely to be available on the cheap, 2-3M. After failing to make the cut at City, there is a risk as we attempt to push for top 4's and titles that he will simply not be good enough for a starting spot in our squad. Definitely worth the risk to see the excitement the speedster could bring to our attack.

**Mario Gomez** Some might argue that this isn't a realistic option, but why not? Gomez is out of favor at Bayern and could risk losing a WC spot next summer if he rides the bench all season long. He has more than proven that he is a successful goal scorer that can score in German, International, and European competition with relative ease.

Bath actually has a lot of regency stuff too, which you might find interesting, but it also has an ancient bathhouse which doubles as a museum into roman life. Cirencester was the roman capital of Britain. It's a Cotswold town now and part of it's appeal is the area's attractiveness.

One thing I also reccomend (and you may have it in Canada already) is Horrible Histories.

* John Hurt's ""Doctor"" is the same person that the Doctor is.
* The promise that was made was within the name ""The Doctor"". Self proclaiming himself as ""The Doctor"" stands for the things we know the Doctor to be (his overall positive morals/values)
* When the Doctor was John Hurt's ""Doctor"", he broke what it means to be the Doctor (in relatable terms: a firefighter can't be called a firefighter if they start to make the fires instead of putting them out)

Quote from the show (reading it might make more sense than just hearing it) :

11th Dr, ""The name I chose is the Doctor. The name you choose - it's like a promise you make. He's the one who broke the promise...he is my secret.""

Hurt's Dr, ""What I did, I did without choice -""

11th Dr, ""I know.""

Hurt's Dr, ""In the name of peace and sanity.""

11th Dr, ""But not in the name of the Doctor.""

While he did have a great goal/minute ratio this season he only played in 35 games total at an average of 57 minutes per game. The reason I say loan him out is because he's not ready for a full EPL season + Champs League + various cups. Skill wise and mentally he's ready but sometimes you have to protect players from themselves. If we keep him on and he's thrust into a starting role for whatever reason and ends up having to play 50+ games, that could hamper his development.

Plus playing for us comes with a great deal of expectations and often the need for instant results. I don't want him to get frustrated and take a big dip in form and confidence like he did his first year with us. These are prime development years and I'm honestly afraid of Chelsea grossly mismanaging him.

My issue is that they are blocking anything at all because you can't block anything on the internet and if you want to get to these sites you can.

true,bmatul,num5,,"&gt;Who are our current XI and where do we need improvement?


While I agree with you that things aren't as dire as some on this subreddit might think, we definitely need some changes to progress as a squad. The XI we have right now can challenge for fourth place; but if we really want to push ahead and challenge the Manchester clubs, there are a couple places we should improve.


This is our best lineup, with backups which we need for every position:


-----------------------------Lloris/Friedel-----------------------------

Walker/Naughton--Kaboul/Dawson--Verts/Caulker--BAE/Rose

----------------------Sandro/Parker(Livermore)--------------------

--------Dembélé/Carroll-----------Holtby/THudd-------------------

Lennon/Townsend--------Ade/Defoe------Bale/Dempsey(Siggy)


That's a solid squad, but its not amazing. The biggest, most obvious gap is at striker. We have two names that are brilliant on their day, but are both extreme form players, and last season were off form more than they were on it. We need to improve at striker this window. There are lots of possibilities here, Villa, Remy, Soldado, Negredo, Damiao. 

Next, I (and a lot of other people) think Benny's time is up. I love his personality but he was not good enough last year to start for a top 4 team. AVB saw it - even when BAE was healthy, he preferred Naughton or Vertonghen, both out of position, to Benny in some games. Danny Rose was possibly Sunderland's best player this season, and will want the spot. If AVB thinks he's the real deal, we either sell Benny for a replacement or keep him for cover, but we need a new solution at LB.

Then center midfield. You are definitely on to something when you say we lack creativity. If we want to play AVB's 4-3-3, we need a creative player to challenge Holtby and Dembele. Moutinho would be perfect, but probably well out of our price range, and without CL football will probably look elsewhere. Somebody like Rakitic, Beñat, or even McCarthy would be a good addition. Dembele is injury prone, Holtby is still adapting to the role and team, and Sandro plays so hard he's bound to miss a few games here and there. We need better cover than we had this year - Huddlestone and Parker are not players we can rely upon to carry a top 4 team, and Carroll is very unproven (would love to see him loaned).

That's probably all that we *need* for next season. However, to really move forward we could use a couple more additions. A true wing forward to play on the right would be nice, as Lennon is a good player but never much of a goalscoring threat - hopefully Townsend can develop into this player though. CB cover could be required if Kaboul is still having trouble rehabbing. We could actually use a backup keeper, as Brad is getting quite old and looked subpar in his last few appearances, Gomes is on high wages and hopefully will leave, and Archer is too untested to be a PL keeper. And we should always snatch up any good developing talent we can.

&gt;But you know what? EVEN IF WE DON'T - if we keep Sandro fit, if we let him, Holtby and Dembele play the diamond - if we have Kaboul around, if we can keep alternating Rose and BAE... I still think we'll be good.

That's waaaaaay too many ifs. We are almost guaranteed to have an injury or two that significantly impacts our starting eleven - all clubs do. We need to be able to cope better than we did this past season, or we'll have yet another second half fade.",0,1369210868,null,0,false,0,ca3mnmt,t3_1es1vj,t1_ca3mnmt,t1_ca3k7w9,null,1431074203,0,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,0

I can't remember if it was the same when I was bullied at school, but as an adult it's not just that it ""sucks"" in some way that it hurts and you're bruised for a few days, there's more to it than that. 

I would say there's an extra psychological element of powerlessness - that you become self-conscious for some days (if not much longer), that this happened to you and there was nothing you could do about it. 

I think there's also an element of ""manliness"" to this - like a man's supposed to be able to stand up for himself &amp;/or fight back. If you've got several people giving you a kicking, you just cover your head.

I think this is key.
