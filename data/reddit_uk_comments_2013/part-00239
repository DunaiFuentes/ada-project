You can't base your argument on something you think Rodgers told the team, but you don't actually know.

It's tactical genius to tell a player to not play well?

Cissokho had no ball because he didn't get into good positions and he consistently made poor decisions with the ball, so the team passed to him less. Good players get involved, bad players are quiet.

What was his ""solid job""? Passing the ball back where it came from? Not beating any defenders? Having every cross blocked by the first man? He had a poor game mate, face it. JE is better than him. BR did not tell him to play poorly for the good of the team. That doesn't make sense.

My experiences of ASBO's come from either relentless beggars that act abusively and drunkenly in town centres, or problem neighbours. The reason for their success with these is because the behaviour exhibited by the individuals usually take the form of small summary offences that on their own seem petty, but put together form something more impactive upon the community.
The minor and individual acts would rarely get past the public interest test, then if they did they'd receive a notional penalty and nothing would change. ASBO's tidied these up into accurate reflections of events that have brought various people into line for the betterment of the community.

Historically speaking if we're going to go by culture then just plain 'Celtic islands' would be fine; the Germanic descendants in England seem to have no issue using ""Britannia"", itself a reference to the celtic Brythonic people, although 'Celtic' may now be as loaded a word as 'British' is in Ireland.

If you need to reference them, again like Corsica and Sardinia, you can use a geographic term, like ""Mediterranean islands"" or ""Caribbean archipelago"" - this is where Islands of the North Atlantic comes from, which does abbreviate to ""Iona"" which helpfully is also a real island, a historical place of shared cultural history between Gaelic, Briton, Germanic and Norse inhabitants of the islands, one of the few places in the islands that has had influence from all of the above. If we want to artificially create a collective name - as ""British Isles"" was once too - we wouldn't go far wrong in bringing people together with that.

But again, personally I don't think it's needed. ""Britain and Ireland"" is no more a mouthful than ""The British Isles"".

true,RassimoFlom,null,null,"I did read many of those pieces as examples of travel writing that were patently rooted in ethnocentrism and a feeling of imperial superiority whilst studying Social Anthropology.

The feudal system is quite a specific form of government, not present in Africa prior to colonialisation. Genocide, although a nebulous concept, I will admit, is common across history for much of humanity. Warfare is indeed common across much of humanity. Both are present now in technologically advanced countries.

We have different diseases here and now, many of which are as obscene in their own way. But are you comparing diseases of First World Britain to the whole Pre Colonial continent of Africa? You anyway didn't mention a particular sort of disease as far as I can read.

It is deeply telling that all of your ethnographic accounts are Victorian and pre Victorian (a time when British superiority was simply assumed). More considered histories and ethnologies are being written right now. Whilst those men were writing those pieces, 5 year olds were working in factories here, waterborne diseases such as cholera were rife and killed millions and malnutrition was common. One could still sell one's wife at market. In the early part of the writing you describe, people were still tortured in the street before being murdered publicly by the state. An objective comparison would probably not be favourable to pre/Victorian England.

There is plenty of archaeological, anthropological and oral evidence of African Civilisation in the Sub Saharan region going way back. There was a recent series about it on BBC4 if you are interested. And it goes without saying that there are places in countries like modern day Mali, Ethiopia and headed up into the Middle East, that were centres of learning to rival Oxford and Cambridge, possibly centuries before.

What I am really talking about is cultural relativism and ethnocentrism. The idea that we judge from a particular cultural and temporal position things as ""right"" or ""wrong"" or ""better"" or ""worse."" 

My secondary point being that your depiction of the Westerners as people bringing civilisation to a continent without any is deeply misguided.

As I was the one who took the inscription and as it was unusual I had to do the follow up research on this one.  Four days I spent in newspaper archives. More or less, her husband hit her, she fell and banged her head on the fireplace. Knocking her into a catatonic state. A local doctor pronounced her dead, she was buried, it was an afternoon service. About 5 hours later two grave robbers tried to cut her finger off to get to her ring. Yeap woke up, blah blah, scared husband, blah blah, divorced him, blah blah. Re-married, had kids. Lived to a ripe ild age This story was reported in several papers at the time, so much so it made it as far a field as Russia. When people began to re-tell the story to others from the newspapers, Lurgan was lost in the mix to somewhere that sounded local. It became the urban legend of the 1800's.  I'd never heard if it until I had to spend four days researching the thing. Going through roll upon roll of microfilm, mountains of newspapers, out of print books and finally tracking down her grand-daughter who confirmed the story.

But what gets me really angry is many people with acute or chronic illnesses who would really benefit from some of the potent therapeutic effects these drugs have to offer.  

Unfortunately, scientists can't go near them.  The patients can try and get their hands on them - I've seen it happen, they're pretty desperate people in need of relief.  But the draconian drug laws make their already difficult lives worse for fear of being caught and the impurities in drugs can be dangerous. 

Laws are not based on science.  Science is the epitome of logic.  Did anyone actually expect anything the government does to based on logic?

Edit: I guess there is an argument to be made for intent to make contact; if the defender was trying to clear it but mis-kicks it, that is an own goal, but if it hits a defender trying to avoid it or who simply doesn't see it coming it should be given to the striker.

true,GavinZac,irish,Tutorial Island,"&gt; Yes, I know that. Now, where in the world am I from? Because you'd need that information before throwing about accusations of ""you did this"".

I'm going to go out on a limb, based on your ignorance and attitude (and the subreddit you are in), and assume that you are from Britain. Failing that, probably some colony that still degrades itself by including the British flag on its own, as if to say ""we still love you mommy, thanks for exterminating the natives"". As an absolute last resort, based on sheer numbers and again, cultural and geographic ignorance, America? Then again, ignorance is a generalised trait not *completely* tied to location; you could just be an idiot from any country, really. If I've offended you by calling you British, do please let me know; irony is delicious. Oh well, regardless of whether you can accept the information I'm giving you, at least you are no longer *ignorant*; since you've heard the truth and its reasoning and are denying it still, at least I've given you the choice to be correct or be incorrect; ignorance is no longer an excuse for you.

&gt; Ergo it's complete and utter bullshit that the term comes from the turn of the 19th century.

Remember that large gap between Ptolemy before Christ and your first reference to the term in the 16 century? The two are unrelated, unless you think many mediaeval Britons were scholars of ancient Greece. Indeed, the term ""Britain"" itself had fallen out of use for centuries - only with the Act of Union did it become relevant again. The author you refer to is John Dee, the very person who *invented* the term ""British Empire"" - he also included Iceland in his ""British Isles"", and referred to the north Atlantic as ""The British Ocean"". [I like to imagine that this is his great, great, great, great, great grandson](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02449/euro_2449796b.jpg). Needless to say, only one of those concepts achieved popular usage. It wasn't until half a century later that Peter Heylen uses the same flawed logic as you: 

&gt; The inhabitants of Ireland must have come from Britain as it was the nearest land; He notes that ancient writers (such as Ptolemy) called Ireland a Brttiʃh Iland; He cites the observation of the first-century Roman writer Tacitus that the habits and disposition of the people in Ireland were not much unlike the Brittaines

Why was he grasping at straws? Historical fallacies, long outdated terminology and the startling revelation that two celtic populations were similar? Because the term was unpopular and resisted from its first usage by the Irish and *people who knew anything about history* (the Gaels preceded the Britons to the islands, yes, but the Britons arrived afterwards, replacing the Gaels in Britain who would not return for centuries until the Dal Riada; Ireland's population genetically is most similar to the celtic lands in Iberia, e.g. Galicia; Great Britain's is predictably most similar to 'Lesser Britain', i.e. Brittany). Historically, mythologically, linguistically, economically and culturally there wasn't enough connection between the two. The term remained unpopular until the *political* union of Great Britain and Ireland enabled its somewhat accurate usage, and only then was it finally used in parliament; and since we are nearing a century since the last time Ireland and the 'rest' of the UK were politically unified, it should be safe to say that this reasoning no longer applies.

I'll leave the final words to people who demonstrably know what they are talking about.

&gt; English claims that kings of Scotland had regularly recognised the feudal suzerainty of the English Crown had to be abandoned in 1603 when the Scottish royal house inherited the English Crown. But the fact is that many of the inhabitants of Britain – especially intellectuals around the royal Courts – had for centuries conceptualised a relationship which bound them (England and Scotland) together into a common history. There was no historical myths binding Ireland into the story. The term 'Britain' was widely understood and it excluded Ireland; there was no geopolitical term binding together the archipelago.""
John Morrill, 1996, The Oxford Illustrated History of Tudor and Stuart Britain, Oxford University Press: Oxford

I'm afraid your ignorance is showing, waves are created by the wind. No wind - no waves. 

But we should be investing in wave power as well as tidal and other forms of renewables, and most companies that develop and operate wind farms are putting money into research into those technologies. The simple fact is though that wave and tidal are not mature enough to go to commercial scale... yet.

Also the UK has one of the best wind resources in the world, to not make use of that resource just because some people don't like the look of wind turbines is ridiculous.

&gt; Too much wind? Sorry we have to turn them off to prevent them from being damaged.

This actually happens extremely rarely. Mostly they are shutdown due to there being too much power on the grid and it's easier to switch off a few wind turbines than to shutdown a coal plant, because at that point the Gas plants are already mostly switched off. That big storm that hit the South of England a little while back, resulted in record production in wind power across all of Europe. Some offshore windfarms that were in the direct path of the storm were switched off for a grand total of 3 hours.

Personally I've found RTD's transformation of the Doctor from renegade Timelord to demigod to have driven the story straight into a very narrow corner. It's the Superman problem... sure, he's great when it comes to one planet in a corner of Mutter's Spiral, but what happens when it's a war on multiple fronts spread across time? Hopeless... so, we plant him mostly on Earth, promote Earth to some special status (no more Gallifrey so we have to have something to hinge the stories on!) and... here we are.

While the Daleks were wholly nasty creatures, the Timelords were of all stripes... killing them off en masse never sat well either, and simply reinforced the whole demigod thing (fixed points in time but hey, let's reboot the universe once in a while!) I wouldn't mind seeing them return in some form or another (oh how tantalizing the episode *The Doctor's Wife* was... until it was clear what was going on... shades of Compassion IMHO).

I like the new series... I like it more when it dabbles with the larger storylines (the Master, campy though he was, from fundamentally twisted and evil to a Loki-like troubled youth). Instead we get layer upon layer of Earth-centric paintjobs (the Silence are a great example... presumably people went on randomly killing them from 1969 onwards - someone's going to trip over the piles of bodies eventually.)

Loose threads... loads and loads of 'em, especially under RTD's watch... and while the old series has them too it had more texture than the kiss-of-the-week club it's become. The newly hormonal Doctor is a bit silly... Jack? The Ponds? It's nice to see that texture, but for the Doctor it's really out of character. That's something I rather hope Capaldi's Doctor will quash.

Of the current three, I like 11 the best: lots more depth of spirit than the others (9 was a tortured soul, 10 was pretty but rather annoyingly trite, while 11 looks both young and ancient by turns). I expect this episode to be another ""here's another excuse for why we killed them off but hey, explosions!""... which, for what the new series is would be par for the course. Fun to watch, but missing the breadth of a larger framework that isn't so dependent on a *deus ex machina* Doctor.

With the 2005 revival, I really hoped they'd follow the Virgin/BBC novels and Big Finish audios into a darker place, weaving established background elements (and new ones) into a new, richer tapestry of Doctor Who stories. It bought popularity but at a rather high cost to integrity. I'm tempted to call it a reboot because while it didn't start anew from day one it certainly took off on a very different vector from the old series. I can lay a some blame at the foot of the Time War but not nearly all of it.

**PS: Don't get me started on that ""fixed point in history"" jazz (whoops! too late!)... Yet another post-2005 invention to paper over the gaping plot hole left when Gallifrey was punched out of existence. Web of Time? Well, without the Timelords who's to say what stays and what goes? (And weren't THEY the only truly fixed point in the Universe? The Causal Nexus?? So much for that! Let's just invent some convenient excuses now that nobody's left to mind *that* gate. Let's promote the Doctor to demigod!)**

Bah! Look, I don't hate the show, I watch it as religiously as the next fan... I just think that the plot holes they created by tearing the entire backstory into little meaningless pieces the way they did was a hack job. I'm hopeful the 50th will tie up more than a few loose ends... but short of another reboot I expect this ball of yarn will unravel once again after Christmas.",0,1384083231,null,0,1384084435,0,cdayafi,t3_1qab4s,t1_cdayafi,t3_1qab4s,null,1428718393,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

Owning just one property to let out is an overly risky venture. Not so much that the house itself won't be worth anything but repayments. Sure you might get slightly more rent than the mortgage payments BUT you are badly exposed should something happen to your ability to have a paying tenant.

This could be something as simple as 1 month empty while you find new tenants. It could be a big repair job needed that you can't currently afford. Or a tenant who refuses to pay and needs evicting.
Advise often begins by saying consider your property to be occupied for 11 pay months of the year. With 4-5 properties this can be easily covered but with one?

I started supporting around the start of the Hoddle era. We had a few skilled players (Wise, Peacock), but we were mostly comprised of hard-working youth products. This was not the Chelsea of today by any stretch of the imagination. Our season aim was to not get relegated. Then Ruud arrived...

At Milan he played as a striker or number 10, but as part of moving to Chelsea he wanted to have more fun, so he joined as a sweeper. Obviously, he was defensively fragile, but the class he showed on the ball was a step above most players in the league. 

He would receive a pass, control it instantly before pinging a 60 yard ball onto someone's feet, or a first-time [outside of the foot](http://youtu.be/WV3hUPex0bE) through pass. He would do crazy things like juggle the ball around 4 challenges, or do a 360 spin past two players. He scored several 30-yard lobs. Sometimes he had no-one to pass to, so he had to turn on the [magic](http://youtu.be/mCkciwltGEs). Sadly I can't find many good videos of his time here.

Overall he could be quite inconsistent, especially when opposition realised all our play went through him (so they'd hack him down mercilessly). He didn't always have a lot of running in him, so he'd have to pick his explosive moments. He also required his teammates to do all the tackling :)

At the time, the press were up in arms about his 25k/week wages. Feels quaint by today's standards!

true,GavinZac,irish,Tutorial Island,"I've already gone into great detail on this in a nearby thread The idea of referring to Ireland as ""British"" is in historical terms quite new new; Ireland is not ethnically, culturally, linguistically or (except for a brief few hundred years of unification that ended almost a century ago) politically British. It was not considered British when the *United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland* was created. The two were treated as separate domains until the advent of imperialism and the first use of it since before Christ was by the same author (John Dee) in the same treatise as the invention of the term ""British Empire"".

&gt;It's not some imperialist conspiracy, they're literally just using the correct geographic definitions to talk about the weather. 

Again, as I said elsewhere, I know that they are not meaning to be 'imperialist' now, and they are using it in a geographic sense. However, that is the origin of the phrase as they are using it, and both the RoI government and the UK government no longer use it officially, and with good reason: What one person considers benign can be offensive to someone else, and the majority of people in Ireland are, and always have been, uncomfortable with the term.

And, *again* as I've said elsewhere, if I thought they were using it maliciously, I wouldn't bother to point it out. I believe that most people would choose not to cause offence if they knew it would arise; the issue is with ignorance that there is any question about it at all, as indicated by the few people who have responded as though [this wasn't something that even our embassy in Britain has had to deal with](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Isles_naming_dispute#cite_note-45).",0,1384085507,null,0,false,0,cdaykem,t3_1q9qas,t1_cdaykem,t1_cdayha7,null,1428718264,-10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-10

The Isle of Man is no longer Gaelic since it was taken over politically and culturally by the Norse (whose council still sits) near 1400 years ago. If I were going to claim the Isle of Man as Gaelic I might as well claim Galata in Turkey for the celtic people. It's not very apropos of anything anyway, as I'm arguing that Ireland has never been British; not that all of 'Britain' is British itself. In fact if you actually read what I wrote you'd see that I mention the term ""Britain"" hasn't been popularly used much longer than ""British Isles"" itself.

&gt; I'm not talking about whether or not the peoples of Ireland came from Britain. I'm talking about the fact that the Islands have been referred to as ""The British Isles"" for millennia.

&gt; Where's the logical flaw in the statement ""Ireland has historically been called, and still is defined as, one of the British Isles therefore Ireland is one of the British Isles.""?

Because it *wasn't* defined as one of the British isles for millennia - 'still' is what is the problem. Between Ptolemy and Dee it simply wasn't used. It wouldn't be very prudent for me to start calling Germany ""East Francia"", and there is a far smaller gap of time than when John Dee decided to call Ireland a British Isle or when Heyn backed it up with Ptolemy.

&gt; You've been talking utter shit up and down the thread and revising it any time it's pointed out.

Please give an example.

&gt; rather it's just petty shit about a geographical term being similar to a national demonym.

The problem is, what you see as an innocent geographical term was not coined for that purpose (I'm going to assume you simply didn't read what I wrote, and reiterate: ""British Isles"" in its current context was coined in the same treatise as ""British Empire"") and is not seen in that manner by one of the places you're referring to. I mean, it's not that much hassle to me, you lot are hardly likely to march back in claiming the rest, but again, I like to teach people things. Clearly this is new information to you. Again, you are free to cling to being wrong but not to ignorance.

Actually (this is a common misconception) Ireland is the name of the political entity (in English; the official name of the country is Eire). The constitution does provide a helping hand to clear the confusion by stating that ""Republic of"" may be used as a *descriptor*, but is not part of the official name.

&gt; And to be honest, while the terminology of 'The British Isles' is understandably controversial in the ROI, it isn't particularly controversial in the UK.

30 years ago it wasn't particularly controversial to refer to any south Asian as a 'Paki' but that's not considered on now either.

&gt; This is where the vast majority of people stand on the issue. I wouldn't deny you the pleasure of arguing semantics if this were a forum where The British Isles could reasonably be construed as a contentious or inflammatory term, but oh, would you look at that - we aren't actually in /r/Ireland, we're in /r/unitedkingdom .

Which is fair enough, and why I lead with a short sweet request rather than ""get to fuck ya Sassanach cunt ya"" ;) Actually I'd hate that too; If you look at my post history before this, I'm actually pretty much the opposite of a nationalist - we have far more in common than we do in difference, these days.

Kurdistan is moving closer to independence because the current Iraqi government neglected the Kurdistan region. 

The KRG (Kurdistan Regional Government) set about awarding oil contracts to companies to start exploring under very generous terms. The Iraqi government calls this illegal (it would be like Scotland awarding oil contracts), but the KRG argue it's allowed in the constitution.

What ended up happening was exploration by Genel, MOL, GKP etc have found the largest onshore oil discoveries in a generation.

The Iraqi government are dragging their feet and refusing to pay the people of Kurdistan for the oil revenue they generate, so the KRG are building their own pipeline independently and with the help of Turkey.

 So Kurdistan are export their own oil in limited quantities, are keeping the revenue from the sales and passing on the Federal Government's share. Of all oil generated, Kurdistan is allowed to keep only 17%.

Once the pipeline comes on-line which travels to Turkey and the Mediterranean ports, Kurdistan will be financially independent. This is happening very soon. Unless the Iraqi parliament approve the Oil and Gas law soon, Kurdistan, with the backing of a very energy hungry Turkey, will become independent.

Kurdistan and Erbil will eclipse Dubai within the next 10 years.

The idea that it comes from Ptolemy is a mistake caused by Peter Heyn who, half a century after John Dee's unpopular term, argued for its usage based on three critera: a now proven false idea that the Irish are an 'offshoot' of the Britons; Ptolemy describing both islands as Britannica (he also include Thule, which doesn't exist, and is more famous for stating the Earth is the centre of the universe); and Tacitus saying that there wasn't much difference between the celts in Ireland and the celts in Britain (Tacitus had never been to Ireland).

true,GavinZac,irish,Tutorial Island,"&gt; For what it's worth, I do agree that we should use an updated term to reflect the now common usage of 'British' as anything pertaining to the political entity of the UK.

Well, (and I'm aware it's probably not the place for a Irishman to be telling you lads how to run your country - how times have changed! Off to Australia on a penal ship I go), if you guys are dead set on being called the ""United Kingdom"", perhaps the next monarch could do some sweeping changes and do things like eliminate the odd situations of Northern Ireland being considered part of the UK and while the Isle of Man not, and so on? As it's all largely ceremonial now I don't see the point of having false divisions. Just call it all one dominion and everyone within it British.

Of course, it'd be better to just go with ""(The Republic of) Britain"" and have all of its citizens, institutions and so on be ""British"" but then *I would say that*, wouldn't I?

When I went, we had the chance to stay in a 'government workers house', and as soon as we entered, I thought I was in a country with a 'Dear Leader' as right on the wall was a portrait of the current president... nothing else.. just a creepy picture of the president watching me as I sleep..

It's more of a punishment for the social housing they gave you in the first place. OK, we gave you this social housing but you can't have it any more. We know you can't earn the extra money to cover this because that'll be benefit fraud, so out you get. 

We're going right back to Victorian times, although in Victorian times a lot of the working class paid into schemes that covered them in case of unemployment and saved them from the workhouse. Kind of like early housing associations. A sort of private NI contribution that was replaced by mandatory government contributed NI, but with the guarantee that the Tories are now trying to take away.

Which obviously leaves the question: What exactly ( apart from a state pension ) is National insurance for if not this purpose?

Of course, and the very definition of working class (along with other classes) is often so vague and malleable that it can make little sense to use them for anything other than scoring political points.

But working class and low income are *far* more closely linked to each other than either are to being a chav.  There have always been rich and poor chavs, working class and middle class (and probably upper class) chavs.  Being poor or being working class are neither necessary nor sufficient conditions for being a chav.

We had probably six or seven shots on target from inside the box, most of them from central positions. Krul beat us today, but the kinds of chances we had are good signs. Today was not us cruising around the perimeter, standing still and taking long-range pot shots.

We're just used to Lloris cleaning those up, but Friedel isn't that kind of keeper. We need to play with a deeper line when Friedel is on. 

Also, I'm sick and tired of hearing how hard it is to break down organized defenses. We're running into teams sitting back every week, and they will continue to do so, because it obviously works. This is what separates good teams from great teams. Great teams can break down defensive sides. And right now, Arsenal, Liverpool, Man City, Chelsea and Southampton can all do that and I'm sure Man U will start to pick up pace soon again. I like the fact that we've been defensively solid.

Programs like the Dragons Den are the exception, not the rule,

 There is a literal shit ton of more issues to be dealt with within business than just having a good idea, but the point I was trying to make isn't purely business focused in that sense, but more of a long term outlook.

 Large corporations and multinationals are not job creators, their point is to squeeze as much profit as they can for their shareholders, and the first way to do this is to operate with as few staff as possible. Ask the AA.

 Now this means more people unemployed, sucking up resources on the dole but now they are not paying taxes and have pretty much zero spending power of their own. 

 It's not so much the trickling down that keeps us all in tv's and cars, but the trickle up of money from the poor to the rich, as seen by the closures of many 'big boys' who happen to operate within luxury consumer goods. The effect knocks on until eventually the shit start travelling upwards, as is being seen by the middle classes (sorry for this shitty link, it's the best I could find as such short notice, but I recall something similar hitting the reddit front page not so long back http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/advisor/obituary-american-middle-class-155040791.html).

If we played Townsend on the left and Lamela or Lennon on the right, I think there would be a much greater width, it would stop forcing Townsend to cut inside (so he would likely shoot less often, meaning he'd give away less possession) and would mean that we have the width that we seemed to love so much in seasons gone by. 

In doing so, it will mean we no longer make our oppositions' defences group into the centre of the pitch, meaning there would be more space for players like Erikson, Holtby, Dembele or Paulinho to work their magic in the centre of the pitch and play through one of either Defoe or Soldado (more likely the latter).

Neither side is clear of blame in Sri Lanka. Both the LTTE and the army committed atrocious crimes, and I feel a lot of the population don't really know about what the army did, or defend it due to patriotism and state propaganda.

On one hand, the government of a country has no excuse to attack an ethnic minority like this, especially when they are its own citizens, even if it is a civil war; many civilians were brutally attacked. On the other hand, the LTTE were very underhanded and at one point impinged on a ceasefire they had agreed to (I don't remember the reason why).

#Channel 4 was really the only outlet that placed any significant focus on this war, and in my opinion they were heavily one-sided towards the LTTE (I should note that obviously not all Tamils supported the LTTE, and not all Sinhalese supported the Army's actions, and even more obviously, not all Tamils and Sinhalese hate each other). It did seem like they gave the LTTE's side a lot more credit than it deserved, and tried to push an anti-government agenda, which seems unfair given that it is an external media source in a powerful country. Basically, I think they could have given more equal and fair coverage.

That said, the  state of the country politically is interesting and a little worrying. They call themselves a ""Democratic Socialist Republic"" yet there is a large culture of having to support the President due to his victories, and I'm relatively sure his opponent in the last election was arrested afterwards (who just happened to be the army leader). It's not going a good way, and the spotlight being shone on the country due to the Commonwealth summit is a positive thing if it can help change Sri Lanka for the better.

All of that aside, though, you really should visit if you get the chance. It has some beautiful scenery and culture, and the majority of people are highly welcoming and lovely, often moreso if you're obviously foreign (white), but you will get charged more or tried to be conned more often. The food is amazing, and for tourists right now the country is really quite safe, it has very much calmed down since the war has finished.

Final note: I'm still quite young, so I may have easily been influenced in my opinions. I've tried to stay as objective and informative as possible, but I know that isn't easy when in my situation.

true,RoxorzBoxorz,null,null,"AVB may be a tactical genius, but he is not the man to be picking the team. The way they guys play is often pretty, and there were A LOT of chances today, all told. Paulinho is CLEARLY at his best when Sandro is partnering with him in midfield, and Dembele seems to actually play better when Holtby is on the field. Defoe and Soldado together is never going to work, they're the same player except Soldado is like 100% better (since he can actually come to midfield, get a touch to a winger, then run on, and Defoe just throws his hands up when he's caught offside). 

Eriksen is the key: he's a player who brings one thing above all else to the table: ability to see the game a few steps ahead of everyone else. In order to do this effectively, like he was doing at Ajax, he HAS to be with guys where he KNOWS where they're going, and what they're going to do. He hasn't got that yet because he's always out there with a different set of guys. You say that the gelling phase should be done, but with a guy like Eriksen, it's going to take a LONG time for him to reach his full potential. Does that suck in the short term? Yes. Maybe it hurts this season a lot more than we had anticipated. And believe me, I'm drunk and pissed as hell. 

But think about it a season from now: Eriksen, Lamela, Townsend, and Soldado all on EXACTLY the same page, each knowing what the other is going to do, with Paulinho and Sandro fully backing them up. None of those guys are going anywhere anytime soon, and I think that's the future. Holtby will certainly be in the mix too, since he seems like a great player and will be bringing a lot.

Maybe I'm just an optimist, but I like a ton of what I see out there. The finishing product isn't there, and AVB doesn't seem to be making the best choices right now.

2) AVB has done some wonderful things for this club but I can just not get my head around some of his decisions. Defoe for Sigurdsson? Defoe is not a winger and playing him with Soldado will never work, they're essentially the same player.

3) I noticed a lot of missed connections today. Passes just behind the runner, times where if the player had waited for a fraction of a second longer he would have had someone open, etc. I think these are things that will just take time to come along. Some players (Townsend chiefly) really need to commit to using their teammates more.

In some senses I am perhaps lucky, it's £5 a week, it's more for most people. I want to tell you what I find most incomprehensible about my situation.

I used to work. I had a job as a steward in a community centre until I tore my labrum in my shoulder and had to quit because I needed surgery.

Fast-forward a little, many more problems with my joints dislocating and being sore and I have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome which is a fancy-pants way of saying double-jointed.
That comes with a side-order of lots of pain and mobility problems.

Anyway, back in the days when I worked, I managed to get into a shared ownership property. I bought 1/4 of my flat, and rent the remaining 3/4 from my local housing association.

The mortgage is paid in full which is good. :)

Because I own part of the property, I don't get full housing benefit which I suppose is fair enough, but at the same time, I am subject to the bedroom tax, which, when you consider I basically own that bedroom, seems unfair.

Here's the really annoying part from my point-of-view.

My rent is cheap. And I mean stupidly cheap. I live in a 2-bedroom flat and the total rent (without any benefits) would be £188 pcm. But I only get about £80 of it paid in housing benefit, so I have to pay the £100 myself from my ESA. 

Like I said, my rent is not big at all, but when I have to pay 25% of my monthly ESA income towards rent, this does kinda hurt. :/ My partner does not work due to being medically retired from her last job due to having MS. She claims no benefits (our housing is a joint claim) she gets £250 a month in a pension from her work but our income is too high for her to claim ESA, and we are terrified of the benefit system, so she lives on that but we have to now find money to pay her credits as literally nothing is covered.

I also don't get full council tax benefit so that comes to another £40 a month.

My solution? Well, a long time ago we started to grow cannabis solely to help the MS side-of-things for my partner. Never ever wanted to buy or sell or be part of that world.

Now I sell weed. I don't sell a lot, I sell about £80 per month to cover the shortfalls like bedroom tax and the hike in my electric bill (yay!)I can't work and she can't work, and it's a shit situation but if this is the only option then so be it.

true,GavinZac,irish,Tutorial Island,"&gt; It's blatantly obvious that the term predates the 1800s

That is when it came into common use. I wasn't aware I needed to give a history lesson to someone who clearly knows nothing about it other than the 'common knowledge' nonsense. For non-specialist purposes the term ""British Isles"" was popularised and first used in parliament in the 1800s. In a way, you're right; the unpopular invention of the word predates this, but even if we go with it being suddenly the 'correct' term then, all that does is make it coincide with the [Penal Laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_Laws_(Ireland\)) (~1691) instead of the [Act of Union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_Union_1800) (1800). The fact that you're eager to push it back to John Dee, who was blatantly writing to aggrandise his new ""British Empire"" makes it strikingly obvious that you're missing the point anyway: it doesn't matter (much) how old it is, but its purpose. In the 1800s it served as a useful tool to erode the Irish culture; in the 1600s it served as an excuse for the complete disenfranchisement of the majority of Irish people from having a say in their government or having any rights as British subjects outside of servitude. So using that then as evidence to say that it is an innocent geographic term is facetious at best.

&gt; Ptolemy was not the only Greek to refer to the island group as British.

Ptolemy was the only Greek to declare the island group British. Another contemporary author (Pliny,who basically collected Science Fiction - he's best known for wild stories about dog-headed people in India and cracking diamonds with goat's blood) referred to it in his first book by saying ""the big Britain"" and ""the little Britain""; the same author later and better educated revised it to ""Albion"" and ""Ivernia"" (and ""Thule"", and (oddly) Fresia). Most others, ones who weren't simply referencing his work, called the island Ivernia, for the Iverni (Ierne) tribe, believed to be a small group in the far south that Greeks may or may not have had contact with one time - Ptolemy, again, is the first and only one to mention them 'first hand'. They aren't mentioned anywhere else and bear almost resemblance to anything from Irish mythology or history (barring some attempts to connect them to the Dairi in the far *north*), but *Hiberno* remains a common descriptor of something from Ireland. That one small tribe named the entire island is often attributed to a misunderstanding; the Gaels worshipped a goddess with a similar name to Ierne, ""Eriu"", from which the Gaelic name for the island (Eireann) and finally the name in English (Irish) comes from.

Later, the Romans refered to Ireland as Scotia, for the raiding bands that would attack the western shores of Britain, e.g. Wales where the story of St. Patrick begins in exactly this manner. Ireland alternates between being called Hibernia and Scotia depending on the author until the establishment of these ""Scots"" permanently in what is now Scotland. The reverse did not happen - Brythonic tribes did not migrate to Ireland; or if they did, they adopted local customs and left no impact for us to see. This left Ireland now as ""Hibernia"" to the outside world - Pliny and Ptolemy's writings were lost to Europeans from the Fall of Rome to 1300. Instead, the collective term was ""Islands of the Ocean"", where Ocean always meant the Atlantic. That one popular proposed replacement for the term ""British Isles"" is ""Islands of the North Atlantic"" is probably not a coincidence.

When Peter Heyn was writing is defence of the term ""British Isles"" in the 1600s, he was doing so by appealing - across the gulf of time that it had not been used - to the *authority* of people like Ptolemy, in the same way that people appealed to the authority of Aristotle on things that were also demonstrably wrong. That he had to do so at all should tell you a lot about the state of the term at the time. That *you* are still appealing to the authority of a man who thought Iceland (if that's what the ancients meant by Thule; others think the Faroes or even the Shetlands) was directly attached to Norway is just funny.

&gt; Picts spoke a language similar to the Brythonic languages, but it was a distinct language. Otherwise they wouldn't've been Picts, they'd've been considered Britons.

Again, this is the type of thing you can write doctorates about. The Picts were part of the p-Celtic family; the Irish (Gaels) were part of the q-Celtic family of languages. No-one has ever actually read a text in, or heard aloud, ""Pictish""; we don't know enough to classify it as Brythonic because most of the Ogham (like all Ogham, really) are names and nonsense, but we know enough to call it p-Celtic. However, if I go around referring to language families like that I'd have lost you long ago, if I haven't already. For non-scholarly purposes, the Picts were Brythonic speakers. Again, I'm not sure what your point is - are you trying to make Britain sound less British? Because you're supposed to be making Ireland sound more British.

true,dwair,null,Old man drink,"I agree with you completely. I think that remembering those who have lost their lives during conflict is extremely important.  

As you have asked though, on a personal level however and being being a pacifistic lefty atheist hippy who has for one reason or another spent much of his life in parts of the world that have subjected to military violence and unrest, I found the experience a little unsettling perhaps.  I guess I have seen the body's of women and children left smoldering in villages in Africa too many times to feel fully comfortable around parades / uniforms and the like.  I have also lost friends and have friends who's family's have been devastated by the arguably needless loss of their son's here in the UK.  I guess if war was always fought between consenting adults I wouldn't have too much of a problem with it - unfortunately it never seems to be and the suffering always spills out into the rest of society.  

Politically, I don't agree morally with many of the campaigns that the UK has been involved with since the second world war.  I feel there has been much suffering and loss of life from those who are bound to follow the government of the days political adventuring.  By the act of attending, I feel that I some how condone these actions and legitimise them to some extent.

As an atheist, I'm not sure about bringing God into it.  All the after effects of conflict I have seen have been along way from any Gods ideal world.  I'm sure that if there was a God - they wouldn't want this.

As a Human being, I just remember the innumerable loss, I feel bad for our inhumanity and where it leads us.  Those who have died should be remembered.

official Government statistics are the worst examples of 'professional' statistics it is possible to come across, they are the most untrustworthy and deceptive of the lot. (sources, I knew somebody who worked for the government in this manner, and I've had the unfortunate experience of having been taught statistics as part of my degree)

They like to hide how they did their 'workings out', as there are a variety of ways to come to just an average, never mind working out statistical significances. (Honestly, I find nuclear physics much more straightforward)

Furthermore, what the official statistics cannot account for are unreported crimes, both by victims and by the coppers themselves, additionally a lot of things can be classified as a crime. Take motoring offenses as a simple example, it is a 'crime' to have a light out, it is a 'crime' to undertake. The phrase covers a very broad spectrum of misdemeanors.

 So overall, yes it is possible to say that crime overall is falling, especially if you use statistics, but again, it can also depend on what your definition of a real crime actually is.

Whilst the PubCo has definitely caused a decline as well, one would think that a pub that isn't profitable isn't going to last long whether owned by a PubCo or not.

No, because % and # have never been considered letters or words. &amp; was the last letter of the alphabet (et together as a ligature, in much the same way as a 'double u' w, or the German s-z, ß), and has a defined, unambiguous meaning. Since ""In linguistics, a word is the smallest element that may be uttered in isolation with semantic or pragmatic content (with literal or practical meaning)"" the fact that even you know unambiguously what it means makes it a word. Write this down, I don't normally do English lessons for free.

&gt; I don't think a jet engine could provide the power necessary to remove your head from your arse.

It couldn't; a jet engine requires air inflow, (rockets provide the oxidizer in liquid form; jets save on weight and thus the fuel required to carry more weight by taking in air from passing airflow), and assuming that you mean by propelling my head out of my arse, the engine wouldn't have enough air intake within my rectum.

Perhaps you mean a jet engine located outside, pulling instead of propelling it out of my arse. But, that would need some way to reach in and attach a rope or pulley or something to my head, which I assume is not a possibility if it really is wedged in that hard?

Alcohol is less intoxicating in the sense that you can take less of it and be less intoxicated, but there's no restriction on the amount you consume. You can be equally unaware of your surroundings on alcohol as you can on LSD.

I'm not saying go for pure unregulated free market legalisation, but you shouldn't have to go to a trip center or have weekly mental health inspections to be able to ingest something. 

We don't take those steps with Alcohol and we shouldn't take those steps with other drugs. It's not much different from the status quo, you're still treating them like criminals ('to keep you out of trouble') except now you're not going to arrest them, just segregate them.

The whole issue on drugs is that of autonomy and personal freedom/responsibility i.e. What right do you have over my body?

Our transition into attack today was very poor. Over the last few years we always played with a player in the hole picking up the ball and moving it into attack. Instead, we were relying on Yaya to make defence splitting runs because we had no other options other than crossing.

Garcia was just Garciaish and I have no idea what the point of him was, is, or continues to be.  Kolarov needs to stop banging the ball anytime it comes near him like some misfiring Catherine Wheel.  We were totally impotent in attack.

Outside of that, there are positives to take.  I thought Nasri was a nuisance the entire game and is still in good form.  For the first time in his entire reign at City, I thought that later in the game Pellegrini finally understood that a lower team aren't just going to roll over and let us twat them which is nice to see and may be a turning point in our poor form.  Milner played a decent game and Demichelis is growing into the team more and more by every appearance.

This was more a game that Sunderland won rather than City lost.  They had several excellent performances and got their tactics and organisation completely spot on.

It is, however, quite clear that he is not as direct as Mata. He prefers to keep possession rather than take a chance on a pass not coming off, that's not something that will help us when teams sit back. I've said all along if Oscar had more confidence in himself (say like hazard for example) he would be a truly world class player. 

How do you know they are ineffectual until you try them? Mata saw that everything else wasn't working so he tried something different and on 2 occasions it almost worked. Running at the defence with 5 players right in your face is not going to do anything apart from end up with you losing the ball which Hazard did time and time again. If it did in fact work and it was that simple then everyone else would have done it. Overlapping is what worked and that's mainly the job of the wide players who were still on the pitch when Mata came on. I'm pretty sure he overlapped a few times anyway.

Not suggesting he hasn't, however it's still not going to help us when we come up against teams like that. Do I think he's the sole problem and Mata is the magical solution? Of course not, there are 9 other outfield players who should really be making better runs and smarter passes but I, personally, prefer our chances with Mata in the team as opposed to him sitting on the bench in those kind of games.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"Maybe but probably not. I think, at least in English law, the act of taking the bottle that wasn't yours and drinking it would mean you can't be connected at all with the harm caused (possibly even if you intended the harm to occur).

Even if you could be connected to the harm, the only thing I can think of that might catch you in English law are that you generally aren't allowed to set traps on your land to catch trespassers - poisoned bottles might be hard to interpret as a trap under the wording of the but judge for yourself. It is my favourite act of all time, the Offences Against the Person Act (1861) and s.31. 

&gt;'Whosoever shall set or place, or cause to be set or placed, any spring gun, man trap, or other engine calculated to destroy human life or inflict grievous bodily harm, with the intent that the same or whereby the same may destroy or inflict grievous bodily harm upon a trespasser or other person coming in contact therewith, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and being convicted thereof shall be liable . . . to be kept in penal servitude'

Try to get around the language, it may be the worst drafted act in all of human history but it can be fun to read. If you can interpret a bottle of disguised poison as an 'engine calculated to destroy human life' then it might be illegal. A prosecution lawyer would argue that it's old language and we need to update it to include any trap you leave on your land. A defence lawyer would focus on the word 'engine' and say this was only meant to cover specific mechanical devices etc. 

Also you might be held liable if trespassers normally came onto your land and you know this and accept it as normal and fine making no attempt to keep them out then left out something dangerous with no warning but this is obviously quite specific. 

Other than that under English law you trespass at your own risk and the home owner is not liable if you injure yourself on their premises.  ",0,1384100353,null,0,false,0,cdb1km3,t3_1q9lxu,t1_cdb1km3,t1_cdaxsmx,null,1428716789,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,jimicus,eng-somerset,"Where your aunt, your sister and your mum are the same person.","It's important to understand what's happening.

The pubco owns several thousand pubs - at any given point in time, a large number are for sale. (Seriously, look up uk.businessesforsale.com - you'll find hundreds of pubs from as little as a few £thousand). You're not actually buying the business, you're buying a lease and the right to run the business from there - well and good but that right comes with a few catches. Like ""You must buy everything from the pubco. Our prices are well above the going wholesale price for beer"". And ""Your rent is tied to your profits; profit goes up, rent goes up. If you'd sat down with a calculator before you signed, you'd have figured out that it's mathematically impossible to make a good living"". And ""Contrary to what you might believe, making a good living as a pub landlord is not as easy as opening the door and pulling pints. You need to understand it as a business or you have not a hope in hell"".

By the time the new landlord realises he's been conned, it's far too late.

All this started about twenty, twenty-five years ago when the breweries that owned thousands of pubs were forced to sell them - Thatcher figured a monopoly on manufacture and distribution of beer was a Bad Thing. Of course the breweries didn't really fancy all the mess involved in selling hundreds of pubs individually so when pub companies appeared out of nowhere and offered to buy the whole lot, they were quite happy to sell up.

Most of those pubs haven't seen a lick of paint or an electrician since they were sold - the landlords haven't had the money.

It's not. It's a ligature: two letters written together in one character. It doesn't represent a word *per se*, but rather those two letters. The clue's even in the name - when refrering to the ligature character, we say ""ampersand"", which comes from ""and, per se"", to prevent the reader from just reading it as ""and"".

It's not. I find working with lower to intermediate level students far more rewarding, as they actually get use out of what they learn.

Journalists were banned from the ""No Fire Zones"" where the alleged events occurred. They also controlled access to information in and out of the war zone with the narrative generally restricted to pro-government positions and views on events. 

Channel 4 instead has done what good journalists should do, and try and tell the other-side of the story as well as report events that would be inconvenient or suppressed otherwise. They have tried to do that in a balanced and impartial way (giving the right to reply at all times to the government) but the specific alleged atrocities and events they have reported are horrific and shocking - inevitably people viewing them will draw conclusions and form their own opinions about them; that doesn't make the journalists biased.

In many ways the actual war and conflict are irrelevant. What matters is were civilians killed as has been alleged, and if so, by whom, who knew and was it authorised from above or the action of rogue elements? These are very grave and serious questions raising the spectre of crimes against humanity and genocide. Instead we are in a situation where, instead of properly investigating these serious allegations, the Sri Lankan government apparently has entered into a war of words with Channel 4, accusing them of being biased, as having been bribed by the LTTE and of being corrupt.

""So when people don't have money to go out, get tanked up, start having fights, violence goes down.

""The other flaw in this is... they said that they took as their starting point in this as 2003 because the rules on how you counted crime changed at that point.

""What they don't seem to have understood is that those changes meant there was an artificial spike in crime in 2003.""

Pikies are generally Irish in origin and used to travel but tend to do so less now. They do have their own culture and regards themselves as travellers or gypsies, but are a fairly distinct group.

The Roma are the 'true' gypsies, who regard themselves as 'Egyptians' but who actually came from around the area from Iran to India and moved west in the middle ages.

Then there are 'Didikkoi' who are travellers who some Rom blood, but are mostly outside of the Romany structures. These can be fairly harsh. If someone is born from a Rom parent and an outsider, they're called a 'Poshrat' and aren't given the same status as if they were from a full blood Romany family. It all gets even more complicated after that.

It's probably fair to say that because of this there's an element of inbreeding.

'Pikey' *is* however used as a general term of abuse to refer to all of the above.

true,SillyNonsense,troughton,Troughton,"Okay, I've spent a stupid amount of time this morning researching this because I am apparently a big fan of wasting my own time. I'm talking like three hours of combing through pictures, episodes, and forum discussion on the different sonics. 

**You are correct**. This matches the MFX. There are a couple of things that might not match 100%, but with such low image quality, I can't say anything definitive about those either way. I'm faily confident in saying that this matches very closely to the MFX due to a variety of very specific details.

Note: The blue emitter, the biggest ""problem"" some have with the MFX, isn't very consistent in the show itself. The originals props actually had some variances within them, some [more bulbous with more of the flat side showing](http://www.instructables.com/files/deriv/F6V/HJMN/GFRWQPAM/F6VHJMNGFRWQPAM.LARGE.jpg), some flatter with [no flat side showing](http://i.imgur.com/afmblys.jpg). Those were the two most easily available examples because it's hard to get a clear shot of the thing, but there are many more. 

The MFX gets a lot of microscopic details wrong, but overall it's not as bad as people say. The paint job is a pinch strong, and the flat slider with the beige tone is a little anachronistic (beige with square button, grey with flat button, right?). The slider goes down just a pinch too far. The blue emitter is flatter, but it's not outside the realm of possibility within the show's varying props.

The Ward Company Sonic was created from a scan of an original, but it isn't exactly the same either. The proportions are certainly more exact, though. Certain things got changed during production. The edges of the recreation are not as sharp as the original. The blue emitter is sticking out farther and yet continues the spherical curve, unlike the original that has a definitive ""corner"" where it turns flat. The blue emitter is also clear, unlike the original which is more cloudy. The end cap is grey when it should be black. The button doesn't go down far enough (they made more room for electronics) and the paint job is also not so good. If the MFX is too much, the Ward is too plain. 

I would say that the Ward sonic is just as inaccurate as the MFX, just in different ways. It just gives the impression of being more accurate because it is less beige and has a bigger bulb (which itself is still inaccurate in its own way). This makes it look *overall* more accurate. The rest of the details varied within the show itself.  

Of course the Celestial Toystore newer relicas are the closest. Their Ultimate 3-5 sonic looks pretty great. 

Also, damn you for causing me to go all OCD on this and waste my whole morning! I am now completely sick of sonic screwdrivers.

1. It uses a cultural, ethnic, linguistic or political adjective to describe a geographic feature; so unlike ""Mediterranean"" or ""Central Europe"" or ""the Amazon basin"" (descriptive geographic terms) it ascribes this identity to the land contain, not unlike ""The Greek Islands"", ""Denmark"" or ""Japan"" in (in those instances, correctly) applying the cultural descriptor to a collection of geographic features (islands).
2. This ascription of a cultural descriptor to the islands and to Ireland as one of them was not an accident of history like ""West Indies"" referring to the unrelated ""east"" India, but instead was a deliberate, politically motivated invention by the same man who came up with ""The British Empire"" and ""The British Ocean"".
3. This ascription has never *not* been politicised except with the excuse of ignorance within the country which it favours. As described, it was born in politics; it was reaffirmed for the purposes of politics, and it was brought to popular prominence in the UK for the purposes of politics after the forced union of the now defunct separate kingdoms of The United Kingdom of Great Britain and The Kingdom of Ireland into one singular crown. Because of politics, it has been treated as politically loaded, and politicians go out of their way to avoid using it, and indeed governments have straightforwardly said on both islands that it is not to be used, because of its political connotations.
4. As the single exception provided in #3 refers to ignorance, the fact that you've read this far means that it's out as an excuse for you by now.

How does Hazard take penalties better than Lampard? What is his method that makes it 'almost impossible' for a goalkeeper to save? Because he waited for Myhill to move the other day? You think every goalkeeper is going to do the same thing each time?

Since the beginning of Chelsea's title winning campaign in 2009/10 Lampard has only had 5 penalties saved, and 1 go wide.

That's 35 chances from the spot since Chelsea won 4-1 on penalties in the 2009 community shield up to the game against Hull this season.

14% saved, 2.86% wide, 83.14% converted

[Here are his all time breakdown of penalty stats](http://www.thechels.co.uk/3469-frank-lampard-penalty-record/). 

Frank is ice cold in front of goal. The only penalty I can recall Hazard converting prior to this one is against Lindegaard last season in the League Cup game against United. iirc, he missed one last season too.

So please, elaborate as to why our vice captain and Chelsea's consummate penalty and set-piece taker should be relegated over Eden Hazard. I am genuinely curious as to your rationale.

Also, why is Balotelli the best penalty taker in the world? His career is substantially shorter than Frank's (I'm not saying Lampard is the best penalty taker in the world). Balotelli's record is still 26/27, but as of January 2013 [Lampard's record was 40/44](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2262671/Premier-League-penalty-kings-learn-masters-past.html).

The PKK are a terrorist organisation and have always been a point of hostility. An Independent Kurdistan needs Turkey as a partner, both economically and as a regional power. So i don't think much will happen between those two apart from maybe Turkish Kurds migrating to a new Kurdish state to seek new opportunities.

Syria is a tricky one. Currently Syrian Kurds have become what Iraqi Kurdistan was the past few decades, an autonomous state inside a country. The Syrian Kurds took the opportunity of the war to take control of their areas and are outside of Syrian control. Syria at this point don't care as long as they don't take part in anti-government fighting. Kurdistan has set up a fund for aid to help syrian refugees in Iraqi Kurdistan in which oil companies are contributing to. I know GKP is giving $1 per barrel sold, at least.

Independence could mean a Greater Kurdistan forming into Syrian's  borders. This would cause great tension and there would be many problems. Iran would get involved with worries of its own borders, as would the USA and Turkey. In fact, this has the potential to become the new flash point in the middle east.

So, i can't see a Greater Kurdistan forming outside of the current semi-autonomous region of Iraqi Kurdistan, not immediately anyway. Kurdistan has the stability, eventual booming wealth but lacks defending or offensive capability for it.

I'm not British, though I have plenty in common with them; but I also have plenty in common with the Thais and Malays that I've been living with for the last few years. I have more in common with the British, yes, but there is something there. It's the only way I can explain the popularity of James Corden, for instance. Anyway, there are many cultural differences in everyday life, and [even differences in the way we use our (now) common language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiberno-English).

It is our very independance that has allowed us to get that close - oppression causes resentment and it was the denial of 'home rule' for Ireland that spurred the cultural and political drive for independence and the revival of things like Gaelic Games and the Irish language. The truth of the matter is, if it weren't for WW1 distracting everyone from the Home Rule issue, and allowing for the debacle that was the 1916 Easter Rising and the British's fateful response to it, Ireland might well be an autonomous state within the UK even now, with common interests but retaining that which is quintessentially Irish and not British.

To copy from a recent post why I (and most of the inhabitants of one of the country's you're applying it to) think ""The British Isles"" is not appropriate:

1. It uses a cultural, ethnic, linguistic or political adjective to describe a geographic feature; so unlike ""Mediterranean"" or ""Central Europe"" or ""the Amazon basin"" (descriptive geographic terms) it ascribes this identity to the land contain, not unlike ""The Greek Islands"", ""Denmark"" or ""Japan"" in (in those instances, correctly) applying the cultural descriptor to a collection of geographic features (islands).
2. This ascription of a cultural descriptor to the islands and to Ireland as one of them was not an accident of history like ""West Indies"" referring to the unrelated ""east"" India, but instead was a deliberate, politically motivated invention by the same man John Dee who came up with ""The British Empire"" and ""The British Ocean"".
3. This ascription has never *not* been politicised except with the excuse of ignorance within the country which it favours. As described, it was born in politics; it was reaffirmed for the purposes of politics, and it was brought to popular prominence in the UK for the purposes of politics after the forced union of the now defunct separate kingdoms of The United Kingdom of Great Britain and The Kingdom of Ireland into one singular crown. Because of politics, it has been treated as politically loaded, and politicians go out of their way to avoid using it, and indeed governments have straightforwardly said on both islands that it is not to be used, because of its political connotations.
4. Were it an especially useful abbreviation, perhaps a special case could be made for its retention; however ""The British Isles"" doesn't offer any brevity over ""Britain and Ireland"". I can't think of a circumstance, outside of habit, where using ""The British Isles"" has any benefit over ""Britain and Ireland"" (the islands) or ""The UK and Ireland"" (the states).",0,1384110345,null,0,1384110707,0,cdb5bkd,t3_1q9qas,t1_cdb5bkd,t1_cdb4yqp,null,1428715041,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The Government is drawn from the legislature but the legislature is not the Government, so it's incorrect to state that a member of the Lords (or indeed the Commons for that matter) is a ""position in government"".

The Lords Spiritual do have some legislative functions in relation to Canon Law, but there is no reason why they need to be in the Lords and couldn't be in some dedicated arms-length ecclesiastical assembly, with the Privy Council giving the Crown's formal approval to all measures.

That aside I'm not really sure what you mean when you say that they are ""exclusionary and seek only to protect privilege"". I can point to many occasions where the Lords has delayed and watered down bad or ill-thought out legislation from the current and previous administrations, and we are very much the better off for it.

&gt; Also elected does not mean that there is continual elections. You can envisage a system whereby certain groups were allowed to elect people into a second house with some sort of recall system available.

Of course.

Like I said, it's not a perfect system by any means and I do think that there needs to be further Lords reform to get us to a system that is more equitable and fair (although what ""fair"" means in this context is open to discussion), but it's not clear at this stage how that can be achieved. It could be as you say where certain groups were allowed to elect people, but what would those groups be and how would they be formed?

Would you or I be able to form our own group and be elected?

Would it only be ""approved"" groups that are registered and authorised by the Electoral Commission?

Go and fuck yourself. For the reasons why (and an apology), read on...

&gt; really sad that some people want to split up our United Kingdom

If rUK didn't want to lose Scotland then they shouldn't have shat on them for the last thirty years. 

Thatcher [purposely switched the UK from manufacturing to a service industry by bulk selling Scotland's oil to change the UK exchange rate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premiership_of_Margaret_Thatcher#Deflationary_strategy). She literally used our oil to kill our employment possibilities, knowing full well that it would not cost the tory party any votes up here. Nothing was done to deal with this shift, unlike London where millions were spent building areas like Canary Wharf to house the new banking industries. Nothing in recent years suggest that this situation is going to change. 

This has nothing to do with "" cultural/linguistic/religious differences"", Scotland has suffered greatly due to the Union and many of us want out.  We like the English, we just don't want to be ruled by Westminster as they've proven themselves to be unsuitable. 

So, why the rudeness in my first sentence? You accused us of wanting this due to intolerance and racism. Not only is that insulting to us, it shows just how hugely ignorant you are of the root issues here. I'm sorry I had to be rude but you deserved it.

I have no overly strong opinions on the method, but I have no real problem with organizations being given seats in HoL (even Church of England, I only object when it is the exception and given too free a reign in setting their own appointments).

If you have a British driving license, you already have a DVLA record. You may only drive in accordance with that license; in your case you do not have a category A entitlement for motorbikes, thus you won't be allowed to ride motorbikes in the UK.

The provision for international license holders to drive for up to a year on their native driving license from the time they enter the UK is purposefully designed so that they may convert their licenses to UK licenses (assuming the DVLA recognise the licensing equivalence), or to pass a UK driving test and be issued with a licence in their own right.

I think if you were checked by the police, they would dismiss the international license provisions because you're a British citizen with a existent British license and they would charge you with driving otherwise in accordance.

All that being said, if you were to contact the DVLA and ask them if they held a medium-sized, Japanese bike license to be equivalent to an A2 license, you might findt hat they would add an A2 entitlement to your British driving license, thus saving you a whole bunch of hassle.

1st of all I never said that i have lost faith in Spurs.  Just because I expect more from a team that I am passionate about does not mean that I am about to jump ship.  That is an incredibly ignorant rationale and the kind that should instead be directed at the ""quiet fans"" today at WHL.  I would KILL to have one of those seats. 

And this is what bothers me. people are so quick to jump and point fingers and say ""he's not a true supporter"" when the whole fucking Lane, which is supposed to be the epitome of support, apparently had nothing to cheer for today.  They were silently watching while I was sitting in my room at 7am, shouting and cheering at the TV for my Spurs. So don't even think about calling me an entitled fan or fair-weathered. 

I am entitled to nothing, but I expect everything.  That is the definition of being a true fan.  A true fan doesn't accept mediocrity from a team that they care dearly about.  Maybe you can learn a thing or two from me.

2nd.  Yeah you're right.  We are having one of the best start in regards to ""points"" that the team has ever had.

true,Daltesse,lfc12,,"the first 3 clean sheets were down to Migs mostly as the opposing teams still had loads of chances. Agger was average , no better than Toure then Skrtel alongside him but also no worse either, well besides Skrtel's MOM against manu. 

We talk about this as Agger hasn't played for the last 8 games other than a late cameo or 2, meaning it's relevant to his own personal recent form, if not the teams. 

We learned zero yesterday about how the partnership between himself and Skrtel has improved on last year due to the fact both you and I could have played in CB yesterday and got a clean sheet. 

Just because he has been in during our 4 clean sheets means nothing, he also played against Notts County when we left in 2 goals from runs that came down the left hand side of our defense.

Also that he's vice captain means that he should be miles better as he needs to lead by example. When you are captain or vice captain of this club, standards get higher, you don't get cut slack because of it.

Now like I said I'm glad both him and the 4 man defence is back. As a better reader of the game and a better ball player than the other CBs he suits our style of play better. Also, he is fetting more vocal the past few years. Toure, Sahko, and Skrtel seem more reactionary defenders and also quieter. Agger has added more of a vocal element to his game and also organises the players around him.

If you watch yesterday's MOTD, Owen and Shearer highlight Sturridge's movement on Suarez's first goal, how he drifts from an offside position where the defenders can't see him and when they do, they're forced to make a decision. In this case he showed for the ball, dragging the defender and opening up space behind for Suarez to run into and Henderson to lay a peach of a ball for him to finish.

Both can use their opposite foot so it's possible they cut in/go to the byline every so often, it'll keep the full backs guessing. Can swap Sig for Townsend and Lennon for Lamela for certain games when it's needed.

Sandro, Lloris and Vertonghen has to start for me, Capoue can replace Sandro every so often too but those 3 are the spine of our defence. Dembele is a our new Scotty Parker (I'll explain). He's not the forward thinking player he used to be, recently you'll see him pass the ball sideways or backwards. In that respect, he's great for when we want to slow the game down and retain possession (although him/Paulinho was the reason for conceding the goal today). 

Never thought I'd say this last season but I desperately want Rose to be back now, now as good as Vert for defending but still decent for attacking.

Liverpool have beat, Fulham, West Brom, Palace, United, Stoke, and sunderland.

No. Do you go to the pub every evening?

I'm talking about social occasions, but every Sunday? Yep, bikes. Every Friday? Yep Cinema (usually). I'm I'm not doing either of them I'll probably chill at a friends, or play some GTA online with friends (whether they be online only or we go to one place to play). These are just the most common things I'll do...there are unlimited options out there (go for a run, go to the gym, etc etc)

&gt;You are honestly trying to say you can either go to the cinema/motorcycle riding OR the pub? And those are your only options?

Erm, well fucking yeah? I don't think I can just walk into a pub with a projector and start watching a movie. In the same way I can't ride my bike around inside a pub...You can't do them at the same time. I don't see what your point is?

&gt; But if I might explain, you don't go to the pub for ""excitement"". It's not as if anyone ever goes to pubs to be ""excited"". I go to the pub for the social aspect. To enjoy conversation with friends and/or family in cosy, welcoming surroundings that isn't home. I go to meet new people, to share ideas and discuss various topics in a neutral environment.

I **FULLY** agree. I'm writing in response to the other comment who said I'm no fun because I don't go to the pub. I agree, pubs are not a 'fun' or 'exciting' place.

On the subject of enjoying conversation with friends/family in a cosy welcoming surroundings that isn't home...

why not home? why not a friends house? why not a restaurant? must it be a pub? Like the top comment expresses in this thread...the music and bullshit makes what you describe pretty hard to do.

I can't fathom drinking because you enjoy it because I don't. So, in that case - more power to you. Have fun.

I agree pubs would be a better place without me in it. They'd be better places if they had nobody in them and were replaced with a petrol station or corner shop.

Yes, it is actually a criminal offence.* The Procurator Fiscal confirmed this to us and they included the recommendation to contact Police in the knowledge that we would share this with affected tenants.

2. Small claims process require asking nicely and getting fobbed off by the letting agent, arranging service of court papers, negotiating the legal system without the assistance of a lawyer, and paying fees out of pocket, and taking the risk of presenting your case properly, including taking a morning off work to attend court.
3. Using the Police is free at the point of use and helps other victims, whereas court only helps yourself. Following the first successful prosecution, this will stop. Using small claims means its still profitable to charge the 99% of tenants who don't sue.

So the ""news"" here is that it IS a crime, IS a police matter, apparently hasn't been prosecuted because there has only been 1 police report made in all of Scotland, and that the City Council in the Capital haven't caught up with legislation from the 80s as it isn't on the list of laws they enforce!

As part of the criminal process, the court finding the perpetrator guilty can order that the premium be repaid at this time, so using the police and getting a conviction makes the return of the money almost automatic, without the need to use the small claims process.

The reason for our campaign is of course to put an end to this illegal practice, not merely recover some irrelevant percentage of the total premiums paid by taking the odd case through the small claims process.

true,JimmyNic,null,null,"&gt; The truth of the matter is, if it weren't for WW1 distracting everyone from the Home Rule issue, and allowing for the debacle that was the 1916 Easter Rising and the British's fateful response to it, Ireland might well be an autonomous state within the UK even now, with common interests but retaining that which is quintessentially Irish and not British.

My understanding of history is that the entrenched racism of the English against the Irish, later justified on religious grounds, is the key factor in Ireland seeking and winning independence (compare Scotland, which successfully overcame distrust from certain English factions and ended up filling the ranks of the army, civil service and political classes). You are probably right that without WW1 the matter would have been delayed, but I think the divorce was already decide upon by then.

&gt; It uses a cultural, ethnic, linguistic or political adjective to describe a geographic feature; so unlike ""Mediterranean"" or ""Central Europe"" or ""the Amazon basin"" (descriptive geographic terms) it ascribes this identity to the land contain, not unlike ""The Greek Islands"", ""Denmark"" or ""Japan"" in (in those instances, correctly) applying the cultural descriptor to a collection of geographic features (islands).

That does somewhat rest upon your interpretation of Britishness. In the past I certainly would have agreed that it was pretty much a stand-in for Greater Englishness, but now that British Asian is not considered an oxymoron I think it's hard to stand by that definition. Even so, by the time the idea of a united Ireland coalesced England had occupied the country for quite some time, and many of your institutions derive from ours. In legal terms there is still the vague concept of shared citizenship (eg automatic voting rights) that is only mirrored throughout the *British* commonwealth. Given all that I think it's pretty appropriate to call the isles British.

&gt; This ascription has never not been politicised except with the excuse of ignorance within the country which it favours. As described, it was born in politics; it was reaffirmed for the purposes of politics, and it was brought to popular prominence in the UK for the purposes of politics after the forced union of the now defunct separate kingdoms of The United Kingdom of Great Britain and The Kingdom of Ireland into one singular crown. Because of politics, it has been treated as politically loaded, and politicians go out of their way to avoid using it, and indeed governments have straightforwardly said on both islands that it is not to be used, because of its political connotations.

That's merely a diplomatic point. 

&gt; Were it an especially useful abbreviation, perhaps a special case could be made for its retention; however ""The British Isles"" doesn't offer any brevity over ""Britain and Ireland"". I can't think of a circumstance, outside of habit, where using ""The British Isles"" has any benefit over ""Britain and Ireland"" (the islands) or ""The UK and Ireland"" (the states).

The British Isles rolls off the tongue more than Britain and Ireland, which is comparatively clunky.

I was hoping for a LibDem majority (in much the same way I hope for a lottery win).  Realistically I was hoping for a Coalition, with preferably a labour partner, though not one headed by the outgoing head of the previous administration.  A coalition with the conservatives was a second best option, but still infinately preferable to a conservative majority.

They have been despite the lack of press coverage, remarkably successful in government, managing to implement something in the region of 75% of their election manifesto. Significantly more than the Conservatives have so far achieved.
 
The parts of their manifesto which have not been implemented or have been implemented in opposition to this I have listed the major three elements below with my comments.

1) Electoral Reform.  This was sabotaged by the Labour Party in spite, considering it was originally a labour policy.

2) Reform of the house of lords, This was not acceptable to the Conservatives

3) Student Loans.
They were silly to sign the pledge.  I work in higher education and I was always in favour of the previous LibDem Policy of a graduate tax (effectively a higher rate of income tax for those with degree's in the order of  1% over the existing rates)
The new student loans system is effectively this policy.  Loans do not start to be repayed until you earn a figure well above the living wage, and are then payed back at a rate of a few percent above this level.  Most people will never repay their loans (you need to be earning £45K+ to pay off your loan in 30 years), and they will be written off after 30 years.  It is basically a graduate tax (previous libdem policy) in function while not in name.

There are a few of us behind this illegal fees campaign. The point is to organise, raise awareness, and get people to stand up for themselves. Using public bodies like the police and local councils to help. The legal profession has its place, but it is a club and not very well accessible to the average person.

Actually, on that point, we received quite a bit of initial help from an Edinburger who seemed to know his way around the law. His view was that the landlord sector is quite financially and politically influential, and the 'old boy network' was being used so that the legal profession were looking the other way with some housing law issues. He had some truck with a landlord, and told us he was considering asking an unnamed acquaintance to ""have a chat"" with the Law Officers about this fees issue in connection with a particular firm who had apparently been behaving badly even by letting agency standards.But he got in touch recently to say that he ""no longer has a dog in the race""....no idea if he came up against organised opposition in the ""back channels"" or ultimately decided it wasn't worth the effort. Shame as he seemed resourceful enough to get the ears of the right people.

The point remains that people can and should look out for themselves (and others in their community) where they are able. It improves conditions for everyone. The Scottish Government have stated their intention repeatedly, even revised the law (not to change it, but to make matters more clear) and this should be enough direction for the local authorities, police, and prosecutors that this behaviour...which has gone on far too long...is to stop.

The blog has had thousands of hits (mostly from email and social media so people are talking about it), we've had positive feedback, have secured the cooperation of Shelter, student unions at the major universities, and others to raise awareness. I'm confident we'll see some progress soon. And this is just a few folk with some time and IT skills. Whenever somebody talks about injustice, always ask: what can YOU realistically do to improve conditions? If you can't think of anything effective to do, can you think of anyone who is better placed?

The biggest problem is that both Capoue and Sandro are returning from injury. I feel like Capoue is going to be back soon, after the international break maybe.. I give AVB the benefit of the doubt when it comes to Sandro being in and out of the squad, because he hasn't been fully healthy for very long period since he came back from his injury (subbed against everton etc...) 

Everytime we've played with a dedicated holding midfielder it's given us much more chances and restricted the amount we give up, so regardless of our goal conversion which for everyone watching (not just Spurs fans) is strangely low.

The raw ingredients are bought in bulk on the global spot market. The fats used also tend to be palm oil or some other cheap vegetable fat. Bread makes you fat, especially when the raw ingredients are so processed. They bake it in store to give a nice aroma and entice people to buy. In my humble opinion it is a rip off, but if anyone knows different please tell me the error in my thinking.

I am really lucky to have a baker in the cluster of villages, she has an oven in her celler and sells lovely sourdough bread (bread without yeast) with nothing but what should be in there. A properly baked sourdough loaf weighs almost 2-3 times what one of those fluffy loaves you get in the supermarket.

Every signing's a gamble because there'e no sure-fire way of knowing that a player will work out. If they're foreign, will they adapt to the climate/the language/the league? Will they bottle it under the pressure of playing for a big club? Will they get an injury on the first day of training (like Nunez)? You can't really know any of these things until you've bought the player. A good club will always evaluate why their signings worked well or bombed, but I don't think it's fair to say every signing that doesn't pan out is a fuck up. 

Here's my metaphor: imagine someone offered you 1000/1 on City beating Sunderland today. Before kick off you'd have been mad not to take those odds. Now you'd be thinking, ""what a waste of money!"" Thing is, it wasn't stupid, or bad bet. It just didn't pan out. That's how signing footballers works, except with loads more variables. Would we be better off if we'd never signed Borini?

Your suggestion does mean, however, that we are still be ruled by people who are there for no other reason than that of political patronage.

Gordon Brown lost a lot of credibility after the crash for having once said that there would be 'no return to boom and bust', but most mainstream economists believed [basically the same thing.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Moderation) 

The reason that this rubbish is still printed in textbooks is that it serves the interests of the richest in society who need people to believe that: 

\- unemployment is their own fault rather than a failure of economic policy (because then millions can be unemployed and there can still be ""[full employment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAIRU)"")

\- greed is good, that [everyone is selfish](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/utility-maximization.html) (because then Philip Green can legitimately pay less tax than his store cleaners)

\- politicians should have no control over the economy or the financial sector (because this cedes control of policy to the interests of the rich, who following a crash then demand bailouts and bonuses because there is supposedly no other option)

Economics is bankrupt as a profession, and has been for a long while. Joan Robinson described it that way in the 1970s. 

There's a lot of genuinely great research being done now, as ever.

This is from a dominion with only about 200,000 people at the time. To lose hundreds of men in a single day is quite terrible. Same thing happened with 'Pals' regiments, where regiments made up of men from a town or city would get annihilated, most famously the Accrington Pals.

in all honesty, I hope he goes for Barca, he deserves to fill up his trophy case before retirement.

Harborne = established, aspirational, sometimes called 'little London'. Some smart flats and Victorian housing stock plus lovely 'moorpool' estate. Lots of doctors / lawyers / young professionals.

Jewellery Quarter = mainly new apartments and housing or converted warehouses. Still not much of a community I would say - trying too hard maybe.

Moseley/Kings Heath = proper bohemian near the main Alcester Road perhaps a little far from town. Artists, musicians, and a few eccentrics.

Best to rent first if I were you, I would suggest Harborne to start for ease (get somewhere with OK parking though) and get to know a bit of Brum, it's a pretty complex place but I still think it's a brilliant place to live.

Maybe here's why people won't cycle if that's the case (me clicking along this short road on google maps):

It's a fucking nightmare and this was based on a single moment in time when the Google Maps car drove past.  Like fuck anyone on a bicycle should have to put up with the selfish and dangerous actions of so many people in cars / vans.

The average person won't cycle just because there's a bit of blue paint slopped on the road, which people ignore.  Design proper routes for cycles (like the Netherlands . . . go on, drop the little orange man in Gmaps anywhere and you'll see cycle paths everywhere!) or punish selfish people blocking the current paths.

But yea, cyclists, always running red lights, total menace, never obeying the rules of the road, they don't pay road tax blah blah blah!

The real problem imo is the way private hospitals are getting the cream of the crop for operations, which are being paid for by NHS funds at a healthy profit to the private provider, yet they have no responsibility [or actual ability] to deal with any complications. 

*""Sure Mrs Karma9999, we can do your foot operation, but if anything goes wrong we'll ship you off as an emergency to the local NHS hosptial""*

Of course the local NHS hospital are not allowed to close their doors, so they have to accept the admission despite having no beds to put them in. 

As said above, Labour did a load to help the NHS, and it's in the process of being trashed. £20 billion in ""efficiency savings"" but no front line services being cut??  Really??  Yet more lies from the coalition.

**Facebook**

It's obvious advice really, but make sure you're active on Facebook and Twitter. More importantly Facebook, because it gives you a better chance to interact with your fans and allows fans to see you interacting with others. Twitter isn't so good at that bit.

**Advertising**

As a new band, you don't need to go all out with poster campaigns and the like, but you do need to promote yourself. Facebook has great options for targeting ads to exactly who you want (i.e. everyone in Liverpool, or only 18-30s, etc). You would do well to spend some money on some ads, getting people to your Facebook page.

**YouTube**

Make sure you've got some demos up. I would also suggest a SoundCloud account. YouTube moreso because then people get a chance to actually see you play and your on-stage personalities.

**Busking**

Admittedly, I don't know how easy or hard it is to get a license to play in town, but if you can get on, do this and do it regularly. Have some flyers and/or business cards (That don't have to look like business cards) with info on who you are, linking back to your Facebook page and YouTube. Better yet, have CDs ready to buy.

Remember that if you're a new band, then you need to lay your foundations before building the house. Put your fanbase in place before you ask places to let you play there. Once you have a good community of people enjoying your music, you know that you can confidently approach a venue with a guarantee that you can get people through the door.

The pictures you took of Tiepval are lovely, I once got to climb to the top and the view is spectacular.

There a very solemn section of that cemetery that sticks with me, in the back left corner all alone is a single US lt Colonel standing below a tree providing shade. 

When in Ypres (Or Ieper) im assuming you visited the Menin gate and walked the ramparts, while living in Ieper on summer nights we would walk to the gate and watch the last post ceremony.

Mostly, we don't really *actively* think too much about ya. American culture is everywhere in popular media all over the world so it generally goes unnoticed / doesn't stand out much at all.

Some things - US politics / extreme views on things like healthcare and gun ownership, can create some pretty intense debates that leave me, personally, just shaking my head.

Country music - I like some Cash but the real deep south country thing is something I have no real connection to so just don't listen to it. Also my dog never left me and my wife didn't die.

Accents - see culture / media. There's not really much novelty in US accents to most people here AFAIK, we hear them all the time, from all parts of the US.

I'd be content with the following results as I think they're about the level we're at currently if we can be consistent and the opposition is as good as they've been so far this season:

Everton (A) - WIN - We're away but they've drew their last two games and we have a good record against them.

Hull (A) - WIN

Norwich (H) - WIN

West Ham (H) - WIN

Tottenham (A) - WIN/DRAW - They've not been playing that well so I'd hope for a win but I could see a draw.

Cardiff (H) - WIN

City (A) - LOSS

Chelsea (A) - LOSS

**1st Doctor**

An Uneartly Child - First episode.  Everyone should watch it. 

Dalek Invasion of Earth - Susan's last episode

The Tenth Planet - Introduction of the Cybermen

**2nd Doctor**

Tomb of the Cybermen - Cementing the Cybermen as an Empire and major threat in the Who universe.  Troughton at his finest.

The War Games - 2nd Doctor's last serial, introduction of the Time Lords

**3rd Doctor**

Spearhead from Space - Pertwees first episode.  

The Three Doctors - Omega introduction

Planet of the Spiders - Pertwees last episode

**4th Doctor**

Genesis of the Daleks - Introduction of Davros and well, explains the genesis of the Daleks

The Deadly Assassin - Lots of information on Time Lord society

The Invasion of Time - More Time Lord society stuff

Logopolis - Last 4th doctor story, good master interaction

**5th Doctor**

Earth Shock - If this hasn't been spoiled for you, watch it immediately and don't read up on it.  Defining moment of the Doctor.  

The Five Doctors - Learn some about Time Lord History and Rassilon

Caves of Andozani - Peter Davidson's last serial

**6th Doctor**

Trial of a Timelord - Valeyard introduction and more Time Lord stuff

**7th Doctor**

Remembrance of the Daleks - Opening shots of the Time War

**8th Doctor**

(I want to put some audios but I guess none of them are really key)

Lucie Miller/To the Death - Tough times for the Doctor



**Not key episodes, but you should watch them**

The Mind Robber - Brilliant episode.  Troughton doing what he does best.  

The Talons of Weing-Chiang - Just a good story

City of Death - One of the few Timey-Wimey episodes of Classic Who.  This is in my opinion the best episode of Doctor Who ever.

Kinda - Great story.  This episode more than any other had me engaged all the way through.  I can understand people not liking this one though, but it is my all time favorite.  (Notice I say City of Death is the best episode, but Kinda is my favorite.  Kinda is not a very good episode, but I really enjoyed it)

Curse of Fenric - Shows 7's manipulative powers.

true,GavinZac,irish,Tutorial Island,"&gt; My understanding of history is that the entrenched racism of the English against the Irish, later justified on religious grounds, is the key factor in Ireland seeking and winning independence (compare Scotland, which successfully overcame distrust from certain English factions and ended up filling the ranks of the army, civil service and political classes). You are probably right that without WW1 the matter would have been delayed, but I think the divorce was already decide upon by then.

I think you're underestimating the effects of the actions *after* WW1 that caused much of the enmity between Ireland and Britain but which has been often hidden from memory in Britain in respect to the people involved - I'll explain what I mean shortly. If you care to read, I'll give a fairly lengthy exposition on the main points, of which I've never met a Briton that was aware. The Home Rule movement was a peaceful one lead by Charles Stewart Parnell and William Gladstone; it was, in fact, successful - a Home Rule bill was eventually passed into law but was never put into action.

* 1886: First Irish Home Rule Bill defeated in the House of Commons and never introduced in the House of Lords.
* 1893: Second Irish Home Rule Bill passed the House of Commons, but defeated in the House of Lords.
* 1912–14: Third Irish Home Rule Bill passed under the Parliament Act after House of Lords defeats, with Royal Assent as the Government of Ireland Act 1914 but never came into force, due to the intervention of World War I (1914–18) and of the Easter Rising in Dublin (1916).

The Irish, led in part by Dublin protestants who had political clout, were quite happy with this situation, right up until 1915. The beginning of the war (in which many Irish fought and died for Britain) and Britain's quick dismissal of what the Irish had peacefully won in favour of an unpopular war changed a lot of minds; the Easter Rising of 1916 was the result. Nevertheless, the Easter Rising was startlingly unpopular - a little over a thousand people took part, far fewer than, for example, were fighting abroad. It received no support from the people of Dublin, who viewed it as opportunistic, a risk to everything that had been gained, and just a plain nuisance to everyday life. When it was quickly snuffed out, there were some murmurs about the *force* with which the rising had been quelled - 16,000 men were deployed, British gunboats had [readily demolished public buildings and the main street](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sackville_Street_(Dublin\)_after_the_1916_Easter_Rising.JPG), and in several instances innocent citizens were killed including a pacifist-nationalist group which had been peacefully protesting the entire situation.

All the same, the shock of the battle itself quickly wore off, and people began to reflect on the situation. Many condemned the rebellion, the destruction it had invited the hardships of disruption it had caused. Others stated at the time that it had worried them how quickly the British had turned an 'armed occupation' situation into open warfare, the destruction of public and private property and disregard for the lives of bystanders which looked distinctly Cromwellian (there's a good example of differing mindsets - ask a Britain and an Irishman what Cromwell is famous for).

Into this atmosphere came the second reaction by the British - the rounding up of 3,500 people, most of them that had nothing to do with the rising. The government called for the arrest of all ""Sinn Feiners"", a group that was nationalist but at the time neither republican nor military. The Home Rule bill, now it seemed, was off the table. The leaders of the Rebellion were summarily executed, school teachers, lawyers and poets; one was merely a personal assistant; another dubbed a 'leader' was not even aware the rebellion had started but his name had been on a list as somone who had fought against the British in the Boer war. Another was so badly injured he had to be tied to a chair just to be shot. To compound matters, some people who *weren't* executed did take active part, but were spared death because they weren't Irish.

All the while, Britain now had rounded up 3000 or so people with a shared interest - Ireland's self-determination - into internment camps and demonstrated to them that peace was no longer an option. From these camps was born the Irish War of Independence; it brought together such people as Arthur Griffin, Michael Collins, Terrance McSweeney and Eamon de Valera. By 1919 warfare had broken out - the 'Old' IRA declared Ireland's independence and 2 years of guerrilla warfare began, during which time Britain flooded Ireland with 50,000 of the war-weary soldiers of WW1, the ones that had returned single or to broken homes. This was the brain-child of Winston Churchill (one reason he's not very popular in Ireland and indeed one of the reasons Ireland later  - led by de Valera, one of those spared execution - would never have participated in 'his' War). 

These ""Temporary RIC"" and Auxiliaries - known in Ireland as 'Black and Tans' for their uniforms which resembled those of an Anglo-Irish hunting club in Limerick, treated Ireland (most of which at the time of their arrival was still not fighting, only 3000 or so people were ever actively fighting British rule) as a punching bag to ease their PTSD. The RIC turned their guns on the crowd at Gaelic football match, killing 13 and wounding hundreds, with the excuse that ""they (the IRA leaders) were probable in there"". In my own city of Cork, British troops drunkenly torched the entire city centre, and murdered the Lord Mayor in his bed. They gave the citizens of the city the nickname ""Langers"" - some of the regular troops had previously been stationed in India and had used languar monkeys for target practice. That is still a sharp insult in my city to this day. The actions of these war veterans - which I understand are being remembered especially yesterday and today in Britain - soured the entire country against the British.

The British government came under immense pressure at home - the people, weary of violence, were shocked at this behaviour 'within' the UK (this is a grey period in which Ireland was essentially ungoverned) and that the government had let loose troops which it was not now able to control. They quickly panicked and passed another Home Rule bill, which the ""Dail Eireann"" - our government, in effect - rejected as unnecessary due to having already declared independence. It was enforced in Unionist-controlled Northern Ireland, sowing the seeds of what would become The Troubles. Quickly another treaty was drawn up which granted Ireland complete independence, excluding the 4 protestant counties of Ulster and 2 Catholic-majority counties with British interests. 2 further counties in Ulster would remain as part of the new Irish Free State. This was a dilemma for the Irish leadership, a clever ploy (conceived, of course, by Churchill) to divide the IRA. The IRA split into Fianna Fail and Sinn Fein (Soldiers of Destiny, and 'Ourselves') supporters, the former in favour of taking the deal, the latter against sacrificing the North lest (ironically) it lead to further bloodshed in the future. 

A civil war broke out, one based on hopes and ideology rather than ethnicity or culture, which in some instances pitted brother against brother and father against son. Michael Collins accepted the deal on behalf of Dail Eireann, and was soon shot dead by his own people. The Irish Free State, now in existence and immediately tearing itself apart, was now no longer Churchill's problem. He sent troops to the North, and established Northern Ireland with little opposition from the IRA who had previously been planning to put an end to the ""Home Rule"" there. (Note that in this instance, 'IRA' refers to the 'Old IRA', who have/had little to do with the IRA we think of today, who were the ""Provisional"" IRA. The old IRA received government pensions (my great-grandmother would use hers to buy a drop of whiskey in memory of her late husband); the 'new'/Provisional IRA was outlawed from the start for its actions against the 'colluding' Irish government).

**TL;DR: most of the violence that prevented Ireland from being a peaceful but autonomous ""member-state"" of the UK occurred *after* the start of WW1 and much of the blame lies squarely at the feet of Winston Churchill and British troops, who clearly were under PTSD but pressed into action against Britain's own subjects who they viewed with racist contempt**.",0,1384152580,null,0,1384156050,0,cdblm4e,t3_1q9qas,t1_cdblm4e,t1_cdb9ipq,null,1428707300,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,GavinZac,irish,Tutorial Island,"&gt; Even so, by the time the idea of a united Ireland coalesced England had occupied the country for quite some time, and many of your institutions derive from ours.

I'm sorry, but this isn't really true. Firstly, the idea that Ireland wasn't united is a red herring; in political terms, Ireland was not ruled as one kingdom before the arrival of the Normans; however the people did see themselves as one people, and the people had one language (Old Gaelic), lived under one political system (local kingdoms and an over-arching, 'by merit' elective Highkingship) and had one law system (Brehon laws) The division which today we recognise as Irish and Briton was referred to as ""Gael"" and ""Gall"" - common or foreign. That we didn't have an overarching government - most of the time - is irrelevant; England itself had only recently combined to one Kingdom when it came and got involved in Ireland.

Our parliamentary system is similar in some regards, but also borrows from the USA (one of our 'founding fathers' was an American citizen); our health system is completely different, our religious systems have been completely different. You could say our legal system is similar but again it borrows from the USA.

The exclusion of ""the Irish"" from the running and shaping of these institutions by the ""Anglo-Irish"" did mean that *at the time* most of the institutions matched those in the (rest of the) UK; however most of these have been utterly stripped. It also meant that they didn't much influence the Irish themselves; the lordships were often absentees, and when not they didn't exactly mix much with the 'indigenous' populations. When the Irish took control, they deliberately ran thigns differently; much control was given to the Catholic Church, for example, and its influence on Ireland's affairs in the last 100 years is a good example of a cultural experience that has influenced the Irish psyche intensely for better and for worse; another is our neutrality. Without World War 2, without the industrial town culture, without the influx of immigrants at the end of Empire, our 20th centuries were wildly different. You do still run our coastguard, I guess?

Regardless of the legal standpoint, Irish people view the differences between Britain and Ireland as very much cultural differences. We *have* come together - as most anglophone countries have in this age of globalisation - but (and I'm sure you don't mean it) it is a bit offensive to just dismiss us as being the same as you; a bit like telling a Pole he is German or Russian because those countries controlled their lands. Your comparison to Asian-British is telling; they are Asian-British because they've grown up in Britain. Perhaps you're basing it on Britain's sizeable Irish-immigrant-ancestry population?

&gt; In legal terms there is still the vague concept of shared citizenship (eg automatic voting rights) that is only mirrored throughout the British commonwealth. Given all that I think it's pretty appropriate to call the isles British.

There is no shared citizenship or recognition of the commonwealth in Ireland. Britain's concessions to this are as a matter for its own benefit or that of its own citizens, as many ""British"" are Irish emigrants, and the problem of Northern Ireland and its confused nationality issues requires Britain to ensure the inclusion of everyone that *is* British. Ireland extends the same benefits but only to anyone born on the island of Ireland.

&gt; The British Isles rolls off the tongue more than Britain and Ireland, which is comparatively clunky.

It's not a ""bedroom tax"", nor is it a ""spare room subsidy"" because no such thing ever existed.  The correct terminology, as used in Whitehall, is ""the under-occupancy penalty"".  This is much closer to being a tax than the removal of a subsidy that didn't exist, but neither is entirely accurate.  The phrase ""Spare Room Subsidy"" was invented by the coalition government so that they could spin themselves away from repeatedly referring to it as a penalty, which it is.

The main issue, while we argue over the semantics of it, is not what we call it but the effect it has on people and the reasoning behind it.  There are simply not enough one-bedroom homes to rehouse all those people who have unused rooms.  There is, literally, nowhere for them to go.  So, they are forced to lose money with no other option.

In my opinion, this was never about prioritising housing, or the provision of suitable properties - when the Government was planning this measure, they would have done sufficient research to see whether it would help or hinder.

He gets praise for his engine, but he had that engine when he joined and wasn't making good use of it, just chasing the ball and getting easily passed around. Now he knows when to close in, when to drop off a bit, when and how to close off passing angles.

He's also developed the technical skill of jockeying a player and then nipping a foot in to win the ball while staying on his feet, as Lucas does.

This pressing and ball-winning is as much a skill as any fancy turn. Its easy to dismiss it as just work rate and energy, with the suggestion that any player could and should be able to do it, but that's not the case.

He's also very good on the ball, given passing options. He doesn't have the vision to create something out of nothing like suarez or coutinho, but make the right run and he'll play you in. That's why he and Johnson are a great partnership on the right, as Johnson always makes intelligent runs and is always open to receive the ball, while Johnson can go forward in the knowledge Henderson will feed him the ball and cover for him.

Talking about trust, let me tell you something about myself:

I am Mr Peter Attah and I am a 55 years old man. I am a South African living in the Garden City of Port Harcourt - Nigeria. I was the President/CEO of TOMOBA OIL LIMITED - an oil servicing comapny in Port Harcourt. I was also married with two children. My wife and two children died in a car accident six years ago. Before this happened my business and concern for making money was all I was living for and I never really cared about other people.

But since the loss of my family, I have found a new desire to assist the helpless. I have been helping orphans in orphanages/motherless homes.I have donated some money to orphans in Sudan, Ethiopia, Cameroon,Spain,Austria,Germany and some Asian countries.

Before I became ill, I kept $15 Million in a long-term deposit account in Allied Bank PLC. Presently, I am in the hospital where I have been undergoing treatment for oesophageal cancer and my doctors have told me that I have only a few months to live. It is my last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations. Because my relatives and friends has plundered so much of my wealth since my illness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them. 

Please, I beg you in the name of God to help me collect the $15 Million and the interest accrued on the deposit from Allied Bank and distributes it amongst charity organizations.

You are at liberty to use your discretion to distribute the money and feel free as well to reimburse yourself when you have the money for any expenses you incur in the course of collecting and distributing the money to charity organizations. I am willing to reward you for your assistance and kindness.

Kindly expedite action and contact me via e-mail: peterattah2007@yahoo.co.uk if this proposal is acceptable to you.

May the good Lord bless you and your family.

For me, a while after I started watching Doctor Who, I really began to appreciate recurring characters as well as any time The Doctor visited a planet many years after he had last been there (i.e. *Planet of the Daleks*). When I got to *Genesis of the Daleks*, I had seen something new in that The Doctor had encountered the Daleks in his timeline, but the Daleks had no clue who The Doctor was. Then, when I reached *Trial of a Time Lord*, I was intrigued by having Mel in the story, as she was a future companion of the Doctor, but was in the Doctor's timeline prior to their ""initial"" meeting.

This got my mind buzzing about the possibilities of this show. Could The Doctor ever have a companion, or a recurring character that he meets out of order? That'd be truly exciting and held such potential. Then, when I finally saw *Silence in the Library* it was like my wishes had been granted. We were greeted by River Song, who knew The Doctor, had a book with all of his faces, yet The Doctor had no knowledge of who she was. The mystery of such a character was so great. The line, ""Spoilers"" only made my mind race faster, as the possibilities were limitless.

Our next stop was *Time of the Angels* and we learned that River was in prison for killing someone. Great mystery still remained, but we knew it had to be tied to The Doctor. But, as the show went on, the mystery of who River Song was became too big, in my opinion. I had already suspected that she had killed someone related to The Doctor, if not The Doctor himself (to the point where I had almost no question that it would be River in the space suit when I saw it), and I knew ""something special"" would bring her to do it. But that ""something special"" made her *too* special.

Not only is she someone who can fly the TARDIS, knows The Doctor's name, and is meeting him out of order, she is also the daughter of The Doctor's companion, who winds up interracting with her mother out of order. If that wasn't special enough, she was conceived in the TARDIS, and thus has Time Lord abilities. Not only that, but she was stolen as a baby by a secret organization and raised to kill The Doctor. If that wasn't too much already, she also regenerated at one point and was best friends with her unsuspecting parents, as a character that hadn't been mentioned anywhere in the previous 21 stories featuring the Ponds. Not enough? She almost does kill the Doctor, and uses her own regenerative energy to heal him, then when she finally does kill him (during her third attempt), she practically destroys time itself. And, to top it all off, she is the *wife* of The Doctor.

It's. Just. Too. Much.

All modern companions seem to do this in some capacity; Rose is an average girl who meets The Doctor, travels with him, and then engulfs the heart of the TARDIS, and eventually gets her own mortal version of The Doctor. Martha is an average girl, a doctor herself, who meets The Doctor, travels with him, and then travels the world in secret to spread the name of The Doctor to stop world domination from a rogue Time Lord, before that timeline is aborted. Donna is an average girl who magically appears on the TARDIS on her wedding day, doesn't travel with The Doctor until later, and then absorbs left over regenerative energy from The Doctor's hand becoming the DoctorDonna. But there's such a difference between each of these characters, who eventually became something more than their average lives on Earth, and jam-packing what could have been four different unique ideas into one character who already had a lot going for her.

Starting with series 6, River Song just became too much for me, and became one of the *only* things I somewhat dislike about the show. In my opinion, the Amy's daughter thing was going too far and, as it lead to her being part Time Lord, I think that, and everthing connected to it, was over the edge too. I would have accepted that she was a companion of The Doctor, married him, and had to kill him to save the universe (but found a way around it, like the teselecta). Everything beyond that is unnecessary in my opinion, connecting too many things together that had no need being connected in the first place. Why must everything in the 11th Doctor's tenure be connected? We finally get past the Amy-River-Silence connection that went on for two and a half seasons, and we're hit with a character that ties every single episode in the past 50 years together (I love it, though it is a bit much). But, I digress...

Does all of this make me dislike River as a character? The answer is no. I think she, along with Alex Kingston's portrayal of her, is fabulous. But do I wish it had all played out a little less in my face how vehemently ""special"" River Song was? You better believe it. River, more than any other character, makes me miss the days of simple school teachers, and reporters, and airline stewardesses who traveled with The Doctor not because it would change the universe forever, but because they just so happened across him one day and were lucky enough to hop on his TARDIS and experience what all of time and space can offer.

I'm a guy, so I'm probably not the girl you heard of.

I was just so numb/despairing after that experience that I never touched Economics again. What fun that was. I just felt like I couldn't deal with Macro II after that, so I just stopped going.

do you know what size pension fund you realistically need to live on nicely at retirement ? 400-600k plus.

Do you really think you are going to make that level of house profit AND not spend it on anything else ? 

I find that pretty unlikely. Sure you could argue that with 200k you'll buy another house, but the average price for a house in the uk NOW is 240k - by the time you've sold your first house and got your profit  it could be double that. So you might get one house, , earning you what, £800 a month at most after your costs ? For the same level of pension investment you get a far better deal.

I understand fans are frustrated, Palace had lost 7 on the bounce and with results going our way to an extent again this weekend it provided a good opportunity to get more points on the board. The lack of chances we created was the most frustrating thing considering all the possession we had but people need to realise this is still a HUGELY transitional period for Everton. There are gonna be games like this where it seems like all the passing is for nothing and is just possession for the sake of possession but that is simply not the case. The players are still finding their feet under a radically different manager (in terms of tactics and football philosophy) so it is gonna take time. It will probably be next season or maybe even the season after before we can properly judge Bobby given the inevitable time it will take for him to assemble a team of his players. At the end of the day, there has been 11 games this season ( over 1/4 of the way through) and we are 3 points off second and 5 points off the league leaders and on top of this we have only lost one game - thats pretty fucking good as far as I'm concerned; I certainly didn't expect that at the start of the season and I think we all would have taken that if it had been offered to us in August.

5 years of your life in a sham relationship might not seem like a 'lot to lose' but you can bet your arse you're going to end up miserable and alone at the end of it.

Try a dating website, meet up with some real people of common interests, and see how it goes from there. If you're really having problems with loneliness or find it hard to go out or socialise, go and talk to your GP and get yourself some assistance. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Don't let yourself become victim to someone capitalising on your emotional state.

If the bank's assets covered the exposure, then there is no reason they should not repay what they owe.  I think we agree on that?  But Iceland so far has not bothered.

As for the constitutional crisis, I don't accept that that has happened, Iceland is a stable democracy and has been for decades.  These were not tin pot dictators who ran up debts building palaces.  They were democratically elected and re-elected and all the money taken is accounted for and was spent on the people of Iceland.

And even if we accept their government had no right to put them in debt, what does that mean now?  It seems to me that Iceland can never borrow again and cannot enter into binding treatise, they certainly can;t stay in the EU since their government has no basis.  And what does it mean for the UK?  Should we have to pay off any of our debts?  The current government has less democratic legitimacy than any of Icelands previous ones.

For me, this is really simple, they had the party, now they pay the bill.  If they can't pay the bill then we can negotiate, but that means we negotiate, not we roll over and eat the cost ourselves.  That means we take assets at fair market value and they experience more austerity than we do.  And it means they clean up their act and properly regulate their FS sector.

Why don't they want a proper debate to be held?

Better Together are even trying to stop people engaging in the debate by preventing YesScotland from campaigning; if there is a public event many councils will only give permission for campaigning stalls if both sides are represented - Better Together then simply do not turn up preventing YesScotland from opening their stall. Tory councilors in one town went as far as canceling the towns annual gala when they discovered they had no legal way of preventing the Yes side from leafleting at the event.

true,CrashingAnalyst,eng-gloucestershire,Cheltenham,"Not taken personally... on your points:

&gt; If the bank's assets covered the exposure, then there is no reason they should not repay what they owe. I think we agree on that? But Iceland so far has not bothered.

What happened here was that it takes a long time to liquidate assets, in the mean time governments are supposed to pay the money and get the money back themselves - like an insurance company. What happened was Iceland refused, so UK government had to. In the end, the assets were liquidated and covered the liabilities. Iceland's credit rating will probably not recover for a long time.

&gt;As for the constitutional crisis, I don't accept that that has happened, Iceland is a stable democracy and has been for decades. These were not tin pot dictators who ran up debts building palaces. They were democratically elected and re-elected and all the money taken is accounted for and was spent on the people of Iceland.

I agree really. When I say constitutional crisis, I mean that the public didn't say anything when these guarantees were put into place, but when the government tried to action them the people rejected it outright, booted the government out and then rewrote the constitution. It's the problem of modern politics is that we depend on an informed electorate. It's easy to put through 'guarantees' and 'legal protections' without much opposition because people don't realise what's going on.

&gt;And even if we accept their government had no right to put them in debt, what does that mean now? It seems to me that Iceland can never borrow again and cannot enter into binding treatise, they certainly can;t stay in the EU since their government has no basis.

Absolutely, Iceland is now high-risk and the cost of borrowing is pretty high. I think splitting foreign and domestic accounts was indefensible. I don't think that government's should run around 'socialising' losses of private banks. But the Icelandic government did sign up to say they would, and it was only when they had to oblige on that agreement did they reneged. The reason that Iceland was 'absolved' of blame I guess you would say isn't because they were blameless - but because the scale of the agreement (they agreed to secure bank assets worth 9x of their entire economy). It would be like a checkout assistant getting a mortgage for a £2.5M house. Sure, he's crap if he doesn't repay it. When the bank tries to enforce it though, the Judge says they were ridiculous for letting him sign up for that.

As for the UK: I don't see why the UK government and UK public funds continue to shore up private savings. If someone has a savings account, and requires insurance on that, surely the financial sector can come up with 'deposit protection insurance' services? It just seems odd that the EU would mandate that governments need to protect private savings, but we don't need to protect people from homelessness...",0,1384173154,null,0,false,0,cdboy4j,t3_1qd1t1,t1_cdboy4j,t1_cdbogab,null,1428705744,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;On his appointment as Secretary of State for Scotland we were told that Alistair Carmichael would bring something new to the debate on Scotland's constitutional status. So far, however, there is little evidence that he has anything to offer other than the hypocrisy, duplicity and dishonesty that we have grown accustomed to from the anti-independence campaign.
&gt;
&gt;Hypocrisy, because if one wants to see red-white-and-blue patriotism trumpeted in all its tacky, hackneyed, jingoistic glory then one need only visit the Better Together website. There is barely an utterance that emanates from the bowels of Project Fear which is not prefaced by some overly elaborate assurance as to the author's ethnic credentials.
&gt;
&gt;It is notable that people in the Yes campaign generally find such trumpeting of their ""Scottishness"" totally redundant. This may, of course, be because they take it as a given that they have Scotland's best interests at heart. Or it may be because ethnicity simply isn't a significant element of Scotland's civic nationalism. It certainly isn't the constant obsession that it is for the British nationalists in Better Together.
&gt;
&gt;Methinks Mr Carmichael doth protest too much. While there may be no disputing the fact that nobody has a right to question his ""Scottishness"" in the shallow ethnic sense that he uses the term, it is totally valid for anybody to question his ""Scottishness"" in the sense of whose interests he represents. Like any Scottish Secretary, Alistair Carmichael represents the British state in Scotland. The duplicity and dishonesty lies in the pretence that he represents the interests of Scotland in the British cabinet. We'd have to go some way back in history to find that last SoS who could be described with any accuracy as ""Scotland's man"".
&gt;
&gt;And the same question regarding loyalty and priorities hangs over all who actively campaign to deny the sovereignty of the people of Scotland, simply by virtue of the fact that they are campaigning to deny the sovereignty of the people of Scotland. We may not be entitled to question their ""Scottishness"". But we are perfectly entitled to ask where their first loyalty lies. And whether or not their foremost priority is the welfare of Scotland's people or whether it is the preservation of the structures of power and privilege which define the British state.

For those in the ""PUL"" community that go to university they go abroad and rarely come back.

It isn't inequality because the same resources are pumped into education on both sides of the divide. Young protestants are not being failed by the education system they are being failed by their ideology, which is an insular myopic worldview that does not embrace Education.

An example of where tokenism *could* occur is if we forced companies to have a ratio of female board members, but the company didn't have enough females appropriate to the role within the company and simply chose any female to fill it.

Simply pointing out there are no women honoured on our currency apart from by birth, and then the bank saying ""oh you're right I guess we didn't really think about it"" and then choosing a worthy woman is not.

The impression is so deep, it still has a great influence in the opinion of general public regarding foreign affairs, and consequently, how China actually handles foreign affairs. Cameron visited China around Remembrance day in 2011, and decided to wear a poppy as usual, and was met with official Chinese complaint in no time. It's just not good for any one involved.

The two are completely different programming languages which share a confusingly-similar name for no legitimately good reason (it's often been said that Java is like JavaScript in the same way that a grape is like a grapefruit).

Both can be used on web *pages*, although Java can be/is used less and less frequently, owing to less-widespread support (requires a plugin, not possible on many mobile devices) and security scares, among other reasons. Both can also be used to write software *outside* of web pages, too (such as web server software, maintenance scripts, or user applications), although most people's experience of JavaScript is limited to use on web pages, where it's become almost ubiquitous.

You might find /r/learnprogramming to be a useful support resource. JavaScript's an *unusual* language in many ways (it's probably the only prototype-based-object-oriented language you'll come accross, although you'd probably need an understanding of several other programming languages before you could even describe what that *meant*), but it's ubiquity means that you can find resources supporting it everywhere. Be careful to test your web pages in a variety of different web browsers, though, because the different browsers sometimes have subtly different ways of handling particular bits of code!

&gt;Huge difference with LFC playing offensively with a lead rather than defensively. Brendan making great adjustments

true,Daltesse,lfc12,,"What mistakes did he make? He was average, He was solid going backwards. When the ball came his way he dealt with it. He passes to a teammate 9 times out of 10. The stats say he created a shooting chance(I don't remember it). Due to lack of confidence and probably remembering last week he was very reluctant to get forward(maybe it isn't in his game).

That's a 6. For me for him to get a 4.8 he'd have have to have made at least one mistake defensively or been dominated by his opposite number, of which neither happened. That score is based not on that game alone but on a bias that has followed over from last week.

I remember when Hodgson came in and at the time Lucas was already playing excellently for the previous 6 months. Stoke came in with a £5mill bid and forums and even the phone in on LFCtv went ballistic that Woy wasn't jumping at the chance to offload Lucas. 

Again based on bias. Now I'm not saying Cissokho will turn it around Lucas style, I don't think he has the ambition or desire to, but this was a score based on this game in isolation and he didn't deserve that rating, he didn't do anything wrong.

Mind you, you could've replaced Lothian Buses' entire fleet with new hybrid buses for rather less than the cost of one (half-)tram line.

Just kidding.

How about Bannermans?  The right hand side (as you look at it from Blackfriars) is pretty roomy as far as Old Town pubs go.

Bit further down, I've heard that the Kilderkin (was Jenny Ha's) near the bottom of the Mile has improved since the changeover.

The Holyrood 9A is good too - has a good selection of beers.

If numbers is the prime consideration, then I guess the Three Sisters on the Cowgate.  It's probably the only reason I'd recommend it, though.
