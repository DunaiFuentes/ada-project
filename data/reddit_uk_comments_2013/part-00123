A warning concerning The Five Doctors might be in order.  Besides the recast First Doctor and the reliance on stock footage for 4, there's one thing that kind of bothers me about it, and that I think you should be prepared for, so you don't get your hopes up too much.  The story really does everything it can to keep the four involved Doctors (1, 2, 3, and 5) separate for most of the story.  The only Doctors that meet before the final part of the story are 5 and the recast 1.  2 and 3 are each off doing their own thing, and 1 and 5 end up split up quickly as well.  It's still a fun story with some good moments, but kind of frustrating in that regard.

Something that's always baffled me about these two specials is the way all later Doctors seem to defer to the First Doctor.

This signing would be based on potential more than immediate contribution, so not really fair to compare him to Papa. It's not even fair to compare him to Wisdom either. Technically Ilori has played more games at CB than Wisdom has in their respective leagues. Wisdom played most of his games this year at RB, his only time playing CB was early Europa League games and the 2-3 times we played 3 at the back. The main thing I'm getting at though, is that it's not fair to judge a player off of 2-3 match compilations on youtube.

To be honest, I don't think this new-fangled craze is going to last.  The major drawback of out-gyming is that it's not possible to read a magazine or watch television while exercising.

Grow the fuck up, you accuse me of being arrogant because I said that I'm only interested in having a conversation with some one in which they are responding to the things I've said rather than launching into an attack of what other people have said as if that has an impact on my argument? Well fine, arrogant I am but at least I've not devolved into spouting childish ad hominem attacks because some one I'm talking to have the audacity to claim they are only interested in carrying on a debate rather than listening to me scream from my personal soapbox.

&gt;People who rent can move whenever they want. Yes they lose money but they're not ever forced to stay somewhere they don't want to be. Being in negative equity can force families to live somewhere they don't want to be for years. Maybe you could respond to that point (Its a free country so you don't have to)

Yes renting people can move but they are trapped in having to rent and the longer they have to rent the older they'll have to be when they can, or the more money they'll have to sink into, paying off their mortgage if they are lucky enough to get one. Again you seem to think that I'm attempting to dismiss the problems you're seeing, I'm not, just that there are problems of equivalent magnitude on the other side.

true,executivemonkey,null,null,"That's an unfair characterization of Obama.  For example, he said that he would end warrantless wiretaps, and he did.  NSA surveillance is now overseen by FISA courts and, so far as we know, the data it gathers is only accessed for terrorism investigations.  The scandal as reported thus far is about gathering metadata in the US, not about wiretapping people without court oversight (as it was under Bush).  During the Bush years, NSA agents sometimes operated without court oversight, and the government was using data obtained under the PATRIOT Act to investigate non-terrorist crimes like credit card fraud.

I know that you are probably most mad about NSA spying on non-Americans, but Obama never promised to end that.

He said that he would stop prosecuting people who used medical marijuana.  He did, but his administration has increased raids and prosecutions against medical marijuana dispensaries.

In those two cases, people often accuse Obama of lying, but he wasn't.  He did what he said.  He just didn't do the extra things that many people assumed his carefully-stated opinions implied.  There is no inconsistency, for example, between saying that the NSA should be under court supervision and still allowed to collect metadata.  There is no contradiction from saying that the government shouldn't prosecute drug users but will prosecute drug dealers.

He is also often accused of lying about closing Guantanamo.  He ordered it closed very soon after winning the presidency; at the same time, he banned the use of torture.  Congress, who control the government's funding, refused to allocate any money to close Gitmo.  They did the same thing recently when Obama tried again.  Without funding, it couldn't close.  Obama didn't lie.  He was blocked by Congress.

There is also no indication, so far as I have seen (if you know otherwise, I'd like to know) that the Obama administration has used the NSA's data gathering abilities in an abusive manner.  I know that the potential for abuse exists, and that is worrisome, but I haven't heard of any actual bad consequences.

Obama is constantly under incredibly bitter and unrelenting political assaults from the Republican Party.  I imagine that if Obama had unilaterally suspended anti-terrorism programs such as the NSA's data gathering and then a terrorist attack, like at the Boston Marathon, had occurred, he would have been crucified.  His opponents would have said that he failed to keep the US safe.  He's in a damned if you do, damned if you don't position.  That doesn't mean he was right to keep the NSA program, but it provides a clear motive (political survival) that isn't deceptive or malicious.

I don't see it as financially responsible to invest so much money in an asset I know is about to depreciate especially if I have a viable alternative (renting) that will allow me to save money (even if I have to keep the walls neutral) until the housing market picks up and I'm able to buy without loosing out.

true,BraveSirRobin,null,null,"&gt; NSA surveillance is now overseen by FISA courts and, so far as we know, the data it gathers is only accessed for terrorism investigations. 

The previous system, ECHELON, was used extensively for industrial espionage. Spying on things like trade negotiations was a matter of routine. They even used it to steal designs from EU firms so that they could be patented in the USA by American companies. See [this official EU report, particularly section 10.7](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-01-368_en.pdf). 

The notion that this decades old program has ended is utterly absurd. This is well within NSAs official remit. 

&gt; The scandal as reported thus far is about gathering metadata in the US, not about wiretapping people without court oversight (as it was under Bush). 

This is called [framing the debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_%28social_sciences%29#Politics). The metadata regarding phone calls is the least of the worries. The full access to internet history is the far greater scandal. The focus on ""phone metadata"" is a carefully coordinated movement to shift the debate. It's also pretty much a lie, the other data *is* being captured as has been proven by Obama when he contracted himself less than a minute later. 

It's the same as the waterboarding ""issue"". The focus there was entirely on one of the least controversial things that they were doing. People were being beaten to death while others were being forced to watch their children get raped. Meanwhile we're talking about wet sponges. You are probably outraged right now about the rape suggestion and you will almost certainly be demanding [proof](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2004/07/14/38300/-Kids-sodomized-at-Abu-Ghraib-Pentagon-has-the-videos-Hersh) as you will not have heard it elsewhere. Another example is the focus on people like Asrange, Manning and Snowden instead of the data they released. 

&gt; the government was using data obtained under the PATRIOT Act to investigate non-terrorist crimes like credit card fraud.

As well as using it to spying on the political opinions of those who deviated from the status quo. The US government has been using it's intelligence services like this for over 100 years and it was extensively documented under the last administration. Again, the notion that such a long-held practice has changed is insane. ",0,1371632172,null,0,false,0,calu2cw,t3_1glhet,t1_calu2cw,t1_calto1g,null,1430759269,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Food security. Wetter summers mean more risk of blight and fungus and molds, flattened cereal crops, and an increased price for us, the people who need to eat!

Runoff. All this extra rain has to go somewhere, and it's flooding into our rivers and streams, taking with it all the dirt and debris from oil to sewage, which ends up in our seas and pollutes our shellfish and affects fish stocks.

&gt;To be honest, I don't think this new-fangled craze is going to last. The major drawback of out-gyming is that it's not possible to read a magazine or watch television while exercising.

It is pretty normal for governments to use warrants to seize such data for criminal investigations.  Until more details emerge, there is no reason to assume some kind of Orwellian mass surveillance, as much of Reddit has done.

As for the rest: the Obama administration isn't responsible for things that happened before it existed.  ECHELON (a joint US-UK program, by the way) began in the 1940s.  Obama was against the Iraq War, which was the context for Abu Ghraib, and he both ended that war and banned torture (the latter immediately after he took office).  The Abu Ghraib stuff from 2004 has literally nothing to do with Obama, who took office in 2008.

true,PeterSutcliffe,,Pint of Vodka pls,"Funny, you're the one saying nobody is allowed to train in a gym and everyone should be at one with the world like some kind of flower child.

I don't concentrate on cardio, in fact I barely do any at all. I use those machines for fat burning maintenance. 

Most of the guys who I know that train in the gym are top lads, they'd go out of their way to help anyone who asks them, adversely most of the 'chunky' people I know are spiteful, mean, degrade their fellow chunky monkeys about appearances and just aren't to be trusted in general. 


Though I see that as being purely coincidental and possibly down to confidence issues.

The gym isn't the only way to exercise, anyone who believes that is a moron. I loved rowing, team sports, cricket and rock climbing while they were available to me, however now they aren't. 

The gym however, for me anyway, is the most *efficient* way to tone up, gain muscle and strength and also meet like minded people. 

Yes I could run around in the woods and lift logs up, but they aren't designed for that purpose and it'd be akin to eating soup with a fork.

I was harsh to the OP, ish. Some people need a kick up the arse, this touchy feely self love bollocks rarely gets people off their jacksies and into a regime.

Maybe if you were the grownup you'd claim to be you wouldn't be enforcing your opinions on people ITT.  ""Gyms are bad, go train outside. ""

I used to think you are okay, though now it appears you're a misguided, deluded and ignorant individual. 

Though I am open for discussion as to why you think you're allowed to be opinionated and offer irrelevant personal anecdotes in absence of advice whilst chastising me for talking on the topic of the thread and giving encouragement to a person who sought it.

&gt;The fact that a repair might be significant and involve considerable financial outlay does not prevent it from being revenue in nature and turn it into a capital item. The test remains whether the expenditure is incurred in restoring the property to its original condition (revenue) or enhancing it (capital). Refurbishing a kitchen, for example, would be regarded as a repair (and thus a deductible expense) provided that the replacement kitchen is of a similar standard to the original. However, the expenditure is treated as being of a capital nature if the kitchen is substantially upgraded. 

&gt;That said, HMRC treat the replacement with a `modern equivalent’ as a repair rather than an improvement, even if the replacement also improves the property.

But the way you do it is this, you have the Doctor run into Jack early in the episode in the middle of a bunch of action. We pull a much older version of Jack, he ages so slowly that he looks pretty much the same but he's 1500 years older than the last time he saw the Doctor. They go about the episode and finally, in a quiet one-on-one moment, The Doctor asks Jack, ""How come you never came when I called?"" We reveal that the Doctor called Jack during all his big ""Call all my friends moments"", including stuff like the battle of Demon's Run, and Jack didn't answer. 

Jack basically tells the Doctor that he spent a long time being really angry with the Doctor because the Doctor wasn't there when Jack needed him because of all the horrible things Jack has had to do because he's not the Doctor (ala Children of Earth and allusions to more we haven't seen in the years between then and now). The Doctor asks if he can see and does his little mind probe thing. (Why does he never do this anymore?) 

The Doctor is heartbroken by what he sees in Jack's past. He's about to ask forgiveness when they are interrupted. They finish the episode, save the day and then at the end, the Doctor asks Jack for his forgiveness and Jack does the same and, as the Doctor walks off to the TARDIS, ""Hey Doctor, if you ever need me, just call.""

I think doing something like this accomplishes a lot of things Doctor Who is missing. It establishes a connection to more recent canon, realistically gives Jack some well deserved  character development, and also allows a more introspective look at the Doctor. A lot of the best Doctor Who moments come from when someone has a legitimate reason to call the Doctor out. 

Also, after a reintroduction like this, Jack can appear as much or as little as anyone wants. He's one of the few characters from Russell T Davies era that is available and John Barrowman has said he will say yes to pretty much any opportunity to put on the old RAF jacket.

He incited a generally peaceful people to shout slogans at him in a pub. Nothing violent happened in my opinion because if you count verbal abuse then pretty much every protest in existence, where anything is said against the powers that be deem offensive, is a violent act.

On the contrary. Sure, if you watched only the BBC and CNN you might believe that but it's not true. We know loads about this program, we know how it works, who's in charge, where it is physically present etc etc. There is nothing that Snowden said that was new information, many others have leaked the same data. It is these leaks that led to the retrospective legislation that legitimises the current situation. 

&gt; Until more details emerge, there is no reason to assume some kind of Orwellian mass surveillance, as much of Reddit has done.

The details [*have* emerged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_warrantless_surveillance_controversy#Technical_and_operational_details), you just choose to ignore them. Beyond leaks from the implementers there are plenty of cases where regular people have been flagged by this system.

&gt;  The Abu Ghraib stuff from 2004 has literally nothing to do with Obama, who took office in 2008.

You completely missed my point. The torture was not the issue, the issue is how easily the debate was controlled towards something that was still disagreeable but nowhere near the extent of the other charges against them. 

Instead of talking about the US governments program of capturing and storing private internet messages we are talking about telcos capturing the same data that they need for billing purposes anyway. 

&gt; is just an attempt to transfer wrongs done by Bush to Obama without any actual evidence of Obama's culpability.

This is /r/unitedkingdom, not /r/politics. Your meaningless ""left""/right ""divide"" makes us laugh. The US President is a bannerman, a disposable mop to soak up criticism then be discarded. He does not make foreign policy. Do you honestly think they'd let a new guy come in every eight years to upset decades-long programs?

true,roodammy44,cnty-expat,Norway,"You might appreciate a visit to www.housepricecrash.co.uk , lot of interesting economic news in this area.

The crash has been anticipated for more than a decade now. When late 2007 came, we all thought it was finally time, however a lot of interesting things have happened which makes it unlikely. 

First of all, the pound was devalued by about 30%. We haven't noticed that so much, apart from the increased cost of fuel and food, but it makes London prices 30% cheaper than they were before. That has resulted in a flood of foreign ""investment"" meaning that [half of all the newbuilds in London are now bought by foreigners](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-09/foreigners-buy-half-of-london-new-homes-to-prop-up-development.html). This also leads on to an interesting point. Since our world has been in its Great Recession, rich people have wondered what to do with their large fortunes. Globalisation and increasing inequality means that the world is awash with people who have large amounts of cash. Because world demand is shrinking and the banks have proven to be untrustworthy, the natural place people conclude to put that money is into property. It's the same thing with pensions in the UK. You can't trust bankers to keep your money safe. This has led to massive valuations of property.

Then we get onto the supply of housing in the UK. Places outside London have ample supply of new housing, and prices outside there have actually gone down. Overall house building in the UK is at its lowest ever recorded. [Since Thatcher stopped council house building we have built roughly half what we did in the late 60s](http://fullfact.org/blog/housing_house_building_grant_shapps-2943). The market has been an absolutely terrible way of getting new houses, and house builders have been actively land hoarding to keep the prices high in something they call ""[margin over volume](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/feb/18/housing-crisis-bedroom-tax-failure-to-build)"". This housing shortage is made worse by higher immigration to London and family breakup.

Another issue is the prevalence of buy to let. If you have the money to do so, there is almost no downside to buying to let. You get the mortgage paid with a house at the end, you can write off the mortgage interest from tax and you only pay capital gains tax on the property value increase when you sell. There are no property taxes when you have tenants, and up until recently you even got a council tax exemption when you left the place empty. Couple that with banks willing to lend to anyone, and you have a ""get rich kwik"" scheme that everyone clocked onto. It still makes financial sense as long as rents stay so high. The owners become like the feudal ""land lords"" that the name implies.

Another thing that was pretty shocking to me is how the government goes to any length to keep house prices up. They are forever coming up with schemes to keep new buyers trying to buy in and to prevent reposessions.

1) The rumour is spread about not Nottingham, but the University of Nottingham which attracts more female students than male students. No idea if there's any truth to that, but I have heard it said. 
2) the primary industry in Nottingham used to be lace making - women's work. So unlike many cities, Nottingham women have always been out of the house more, used to having their own disposable income and, how shall I put this, are not backwards and coming forwards.

And I'm perfectly fine with you enjoy Tennant, and Tennant being *your* perfect representation of The Doctor, but it's like these people have to force feed it down your throat that his interpretation of the character is the *only* interpretation. Yep, there were 9 actors before him that played the character, and they're all wrong. Not a single one of them was capable of portraying The Doctor until Tennant came along. They were all just placeholders as we waited for our glorious one true Doctor to take up the role!

I just don't understand it. I've even read a couple instances where Tennant fans go and watch classic episodes, and complain when the classic episode contradicts something in the Tennant series, as though the classic episodes were being contradictory instead of the Tennant episodes. Great example, I've now read 3 or 4 people who have complained that the 1996 movie contradicts The Last of the Time Lords/The End of Time because The Master dies in the movie. As though the writers of the movie should have known that in 10 years there would be an episode that would use The Master. I just don't understand how someone can think something is so infallible(In this case, the Tennant era) that even when presented with facts that his era contradicts previous episodes/eras, you think the previous episodes are the ones that are being contradictory with Tennant.",0,1371639150,null,0,false,0,caluxst,t3_1gn280,t1_caluxst,t1_caluj9g,null,1430758858,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,k-dude,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,"I vehemently disagree. Capitalism has so far been buoyed by every technological revolution in the past. Each of them have not left us with more state control, centralisation and socialisation, but actually more freedom and decentralisation. 

The automation of things previously done by humans frees up human recources and capital to do more fulfilling, more intellectual work. It has totally decimated the traditional working class in this country, which in turn has almost abolished the voter turnout for the traditional leftist message that you sell.

You think that there are more pilots, train drivers and taxi drivers now than there were factory workers in the past? I don't even need a statistic to prove this - the answer is an obvious no. In every case, the removal of manual jobs didn't happen over night, but were filtered out at a rate that allowed people to retrain and become reskilled. Everyone's quality of life increased from the outsourcing of such jobs, and there is no evidence to say that this can't happen in the future without a socialist state that actually impinges innovation. 

The same detractors that are here now in the Technological Revolution were here in the Agricultural Revolution and the Industrial Revolution. They were wrong then and they will be wrong now, because people and socities are generally good at reacting to change, especially when it takes decades to happen.

Every historical indicator says that capitalism will survive and adapt and grow stronger, with a more educated, more free and more fulfilled population.

A more interesting question in my opinion is whether people require greater birth control than now. As you may have surmised ^, I hail from a classical liberal perspective, but the possibility of no more manual work with the reality of an exploding population rate in poorer countries, makes for a lot of wasted lives, high unemployment and probably, high anger. In this country for example, we are encouraging a lot of Poles to come in and do work that will probably not be there in twenty years. In previous generations, the population figures and birth rates have adjusted to a differing quality of life. However, it remains to be seen if that will happen in second and third world countries, who may develop economically, but will they shed their cultural preference for lots of children?

Catholic countries often being an exception to this rule.The one thing I don't see with the continued mechanisation of industry and services is where all these new workers will go. As you said, agriculture went to factories, factories went to services. What's left after services? Services alone can't sustain the world - and when a country tries to, it makes the economy less stable and more prone to financial shocks, as YED is so high. I'm fairly sure you understand this, but I'll flesh it out for anyone who stumbles upon this.YED is income elasticity of demand. Things with a high YED experience significant changes in demand with a comparably small change in income, often luxury goods and services. Massages, gym memberships, that kind of thing. The problem is, service sector products normally have an extremely high YED. If you're struggling for income, of course you'll stop going to the restaurant, you can do it cheaper at home. Because of this, you get a negative multiplier effect - people don't spend, wages go down, they don't spend - and so it continues. Very difficult to break out of. With a strong manufacturing base you can continue producing products people need - cars, lamps, whatever. The economy would then be more resilient to shocks because there's a pseudo immunity, and that can be used to power a recovery.By relying on services, you're setting yourself up for failure, more so if the profits are going to private companies and not the state.",0,1371640645,null,0,1371641097,0,calv53e,t3_1gl3d7,t1_calv53e,t1_calv2h4,null,1430758763,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

**Stoke**: WIN(I would imagine Hughes will alter their playing style and it would take them some time to get into it. Plus at home, we have a decent record against Stoke.)  
  
**Villa**: DRAW(I imagine this would be a bit tricky. Lambert's had a full season at Villa like Rogders and he made some good bargain signings. Provided Benteke stays, I can see this game being a 2-2 draw. If we're lucky, we'll win 2-1.)  
  
**United**: LOSS(I think we are not yet there. Even if we get the new signings, United is a good enough unit and without Suarez I don't see us beating them. A draw would be good and but remember this is my brain talking, otherwise I'll be hoping for a 5-0 win.)  
  
**Swansea**: DRAW(While Laudrup has got a good team, I think we can beat or at least draw this game if we can fix our defense and Lucas performs well which would be the key issue.)  
  
**Southampton**: WIN(Our home form has improved and we would be in a good rhythm by this game which would definitely help us beat Soton by a fair margin. 3-0)  
  
**Sunderland**: WIN(Let's face it, we can win this game without any changes to our current squad minus Suarez. And considering Suarez would be joining us from this game onwards, it's seems like a sure win on paper at least. 3-0/3-1 would be prediction.)  
  
**Crystal Palace**: WIN(No Zaha and a home game for us)  
  
**Newcastle**: WIN(They are on the down and I don't see any transfer activity. On the other hand, if they can get in some good players and Cisse is on form, we never know. Could turn into a draw.)  
  
**West Brom**: DRAW(I know it's a home game but we don't seem to be doing too good against these guys. They could be our bogey team.)  
  
**18 Points** sounds decent. If we can turn games like the Swansea, Brom and Villa away to wins we could end up with 24 points but if they turn to losses it would be 15 points which is not far away from the ~13 points in the corresponding fixtures last year.

The cheapest 2 or 3 bedroom homes we can find in our area are ~£150k, which assuming a 20% deposit is a £30k plus the cost of the various legal fees. For someone starting from scratch, this is a frightening amount to even think about.

We earn about £38k between us before tax, and we have about £900/month disposable income. Assuming we put £500 aside each month in a savings account with virtually no interest, that's about 70 months or six years living as we currently are.

At the same time, we've always wanted to start a family while we were relatively young, yet if we were renting as a young family we'd always have the fear of having to move virtually every year if the landlord decides he wants to put a higher-paying tenant in there.

If you borrow £15k for the deposit, manage to get a £130k mortgage, and can afford the £3k closing fees.

So now you owe £388 in interest per month or £700 in a mortgage payment. Plus you need to pay house related costs and pay back £15k that you owe.

Now I'm an advocate of buying a house, but borrowing money isn't the best way to go about it. They need to increase the costs for owning more than one house and more people need to save more money.

true,alister667,lfc68,,"When Jádson returned to Brazil to join São Paulo last season, the expectation was that Shakhtar Donetsk would buy another of his compatriots: how else could they replicate his creativity and goals from midfield? Mircea Lucescu, though, simply advanced one of his deeper lying midfielders, breaking the habit of the previous few seasons by playing an eastern European towards the front of his team.

Henrikh Mkhitaryan had, in fairness, only been playing so deep because of Fernandinho's broken leg but still, nobody quite expected the explosion when he resumed his former role. His first 14 league games of last season brought 16 goals and he went on to amass 25 for the season. He is not, though, he insists, a forward: rather, he is a midfielder who can operate either as a deep-lying distributor or behind a striker. In Shakhtar's fluent 4-2-3-1 system, he was pivotal, a hub whose movement helped shape the whole. In that regard, it's easy to see why Brendan Rodgers is so keen to bring him to Liverpool: Mkhitaryan has the ability to find and generate space that is vital to possession-based teams – and he also has a ruthlessness in front of goal that Liverpool have lacked over the past couple of seasons.

For Mkhitaryan the move feels logical. Liverpool aspire to a style of football relatively similar to Shakhtar's. At 24, now is probably the time to make the step up to the consistent competition of the Premier League, particularly as the Shakhtar team is dismantled, with Willian, Fernandinho and Razvan Rat already departed (it's not Liverpool's fault, but there is something sad about seeing another bright young team – like Athletic Bilbao and Porto before them – broken down and sold off after one season of flickering achievement; one of the curses of the economic disparities of the modern game).

Whether Mkhitaryan would adapt is impossible to say but the signs are good. Mkhitaryan has a gift for languages – it's a family trait: his sister Monica works as a translator for Uefa – and has a down-to-earthness that suggests he is smart and pragmatic enough to adjust. Just as importantly, he gives a sense of understanding his own game: he is not a savant to whom excellence just happened; he has worked methodically to develop his talent, something in which he was helped by his close relationship with Lucescu.

""It wasn't easy for him from the start,"" said the Romanian, ""but his integration was speeded up by his high level of football intelligence. His game awareness is perhaps his most valuable quality – that and the speed and power and technique Henrikh was gifted by nature and that he's developed. Because of those virtues, he's one of the players who most consistently fulfils the tasks set by the coaching staff. Working with him is fun.""

Mkhitaryan's father, Hamlet, was a well-respected centre-forward for Ararat Yerevan, Armenia's most successful club in Soviet times, in the late 80s. He had a brief stint at Kotayk Abovyan, and then, in 1989, a few months after Henrikh's birth, he was transferred to the French club ASOA Valence, where he spent five years before a move to Issy, picking up two caps for the newly independent Armenia. Even then, Henrikh's love for football was clear. ""When I was a child, I used to watch my father playing football, and I always wanted to follow him to training,"" he said. ""When he didn't take me with him I stayed next to the door, crying. I always wanted to become a football player, and I thank my parents, as they helped me so much to realise this dream. They always supported me on my path.""

The Mkhitaryans returned to Yerevan in 1995 and, just a year later, when Henrikh was seven, his father died from a brain tumour. Football, though, remained a major part of the family's life, with his mother now heading the national team department at the Armenian football federation.

In the pantheon of Armenian footballers, Mkhitaryan stands at the very top, alongside Nikita Simonyan, Eduard Markarov and Khoren Hovhannisyan. As the greatest Armenian player since fragmentation, he probably carries a greater responsibility than any of them, a role of which he is well aware. ""Not so many Armenian players are given the chance to play in the Champions League, and this is really important for me, because I want to do everything to impress the children who are watching me playing,"" he said last season.

""For those children, I want their goal to be to play in the Champions League, and for the most important European teams. They don't have to stop in the Armenian league, thinking that they're not able to achieve anything more. Every person has to keep in mind that they can grow up and reach the top, no matter where they are born, whether it's in Russia, in Ukraine, in Europe; they've still got the opportunity to show their talent and the culture of their people.""

If he joins Liverpool, he will of course have to forego Champions League football but it may be that he can help bring the competition back to Anfield.",0,1371642121,null,0,false,0,calvcyg,t3_1gnc4u,t1_calvcyg,t1_caluxbf,null,1430758659,15,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,15

I think the solution might be to introduce toughter restrictions on landlords: 

* Legislate to make it illegal (punishable with prison) to rent property without being on a national register of landlords - much like how Ltd companies have to be registered with companies house. Make landlords pay a fee (perhaps in the order of £100 pa for each property) to be on the register. Those convicted of poor practise could then be 'struck off' the register and banned from renting.

* Introduce specific taxes on buy-to-let landlords, because it strikes me that right now their profit margins are insane - even if it doesnt affect the market, they probably ought to be paying more tax. This would hopefully enocurage amateur BTL landlords to sell up as it wouldn't be worth the trouble.

* Legislate to increase the quality of rental accomodation - for example requiring modern cookers/fridge-freezers etc. that meet strict safety standards.

* If all of these fail, consider introducing rental caps either on the number of properties that can be rented in a specific area, or on the price that can be charged to prevent this runaway inflation of rental prices.
   
I don't begrudge people wanting to invest their capital the best way possible - but the problem with doing it in property is that it is ruining young lives. Right now the situation is only starting to come into the political radar, but in 5-10 years time when these kids are in their 30s and want to settle down/have kids they will need the security of home ownership -- or at the very least greater legal protections for tenants.
 
Renting has to be adjusted to it offers some benefit to those that choose it. For example better quality:price, lower price vs mortgage etc. Its just insane that a landlord with £20K of capital can turn that into a £250K property in a very short space of time, whilst still reciving a 5% yield each month!",0,1371643896,null,0,1371644100,0,calvnff,t3_1gn7pu,t1_calvnff,t1_caluuvb,null,1430758523,28,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,28

While the average Joe could be forgiven for accidentally bankrupting a company, the directors of Northern Rock etc were supposed to be smart, experienced managers. However, they exhibited fantastic incompetence for many years and clearly had no idea what was going on in their companies.

It doesn't take a financial genius to realise that:

A) stock/house/bond prices can go down as well as up (lots of banks seemed to forget this)

B) Sometimes countries go into recession, and many economists think that this is a natural process (banks and certain politicians seemed to forget this)

C) If you lend money to dodgy people with no job then they might not pay you back (lots of banks forgot this one too)

D) If you run a bank with 100 million in deposits and you only have 5 million in actual cash, a shock could mean that people want to take out 6 million, which you don't have (Northern Rock forgot this)

Houses are expensive, yes, but you just have to save up the deposit, which if you actually apply yourself is quite achievable. 

A house that costs £200,000 requiring a 10% deposit, plus about £5k extra to cover moving/legal fees would require you to save ~£25,000. So work hard, study hard, commit yourself to getting a good job and get the money saved while you stay with your parents. A salary of £25,000 would be roughly £12-15k take-home. If you don't spend your money on holidays, luxury items and going out every weekend then you can quite feasibly save £500 per month. That's ~£25,000 in four years. So go fucking do that and stop moaning that you can't have a house. You can have one, you just have to raise a bit of cash. You can't have a 100% mortgage anymore because let's be honest they were pretty silly ideas anyway. If your job doesn't pay that well then set your sights lower or work harder and go get a better one. If you REALLY wanted a home then you could go get one.

You're free to rent your house out if you want, I'm free to call you scum and criticise what you are doing. It's a free country.

&gt; Don't forget that the money I make over the mortgage is also taxed at 40% and should I sell the house, if it has gone up in value I will also be penalised for capital gains, which part of that money goes towards council houses and purchase schemes.

Means nothing in the grand scheme of things - everyone else is still shafted even if the government gets a fraction more money to piss away on the same crap they always do. The UK goverment won't go bankrupt if you didn't do this.

Sure I was fortunate too in some respects, but there are schemes available to those who aren't as fortunate. Several friends of mine have bought into these house share schemes where the council owns part of their house and they pay part rent towards it. Some have paid their portion of the house off already and are now buying the council portion out.

Very excited about his potential signing but I'm curious about one thing. If Eriksen was ""getable"" and willing to forgo CL football, wouldn't the fact that he was acquired for just 12M pounds raise an eyebrow when compared with the 20-22M pounds needed to trigger Mkat's release clause. Eriksen is 3 years younger, plays in a better league and may be a better player at this point as an AM. Now, it is my belief that Dortmund is simply a fantastic club to play for which is closer to home for Eriksen and can also provide CL football as well as the possibility of winning the Bundisliga. That may have made Liverpool a distant second, although we simply seemed to value Mkat more. I'm not disagreeing with the move at all, and trust our scouting department, but I was curious what other Reds thought about this fact.

I'm also curious why we didn't go after Dries Mertens, who I think is an outstanding talent, and could be had for nearly the same price we seem to be paying for Alberto. Sure, Mertens is 26 to Alberto's 20, but he's also very much an establish classy player already, something LA cannot yet boast.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; There is no crash coming

You are very optimistic.  But please carry on.  They need ~~suckers~~ investors to keep the market afloat until the bubble finally does burst.

&gt; it's basic supply and demand.

There comes a point when people can't afford to buy houses, no matter how much they want them, simply because they're too expensive.  People are getting mortgaged to the hilt at a time when the interest rate is at an all-time low.  As soon as it starts to rise there will be an awful lot of people who can no longer afford to pay their mortgages (in fact this is already happening, but the banks are switching them to interest-only mortgages at the government's request).

The only thing that is keeping demand so high is that people are prepared to pay over-inflated prices because they believe the prices will continue to go up.  As soon as the interest rate goes up and demand starts dropping, there will be a confidence crisis in the suitability of property for investment and the whole house of cards will come tumbling down.

My estimate is that we'll see an increase in house prices over the next 2 years (10% perhaps), driven largely by the Government's investment of £130 billion in tax-payer's money, followed by a short-sharp crash wiping around 25% off the value of property.

A better approach would be to allow house prices to stagnate for a few years while inflation devalues them in real terms.  A gentle correction of 15% over 3 years would ease the pressure on the bubble.  Instead, the government have decided to pump it up even larger.

Don't blame yourself or anyone else, then - there are a lot of parties involved, the government isn't the only one. But we've already established that what you're doing is okay because you're making money even when it screws over everyone else.

&gt; Now if you are finished wallowing in your self pity, why don't you do something proactive and try and better your own situation instead of complaining how the previous generation had it easier, and that some have been more successful than you.

Because it is pretty difficult to do so? You appear to be under the impression that everyone in their 20s spends every last penny partying, buying nice cars, going on holiday or lots of other things. While some people are doing this, not everyone is. Those who are saving still can't afford a place.

There's nothing wrong with doing all that you realistically can (saving) while criticising everyone and everything that is wrong with the property market. I've said that even if I had a few hundred thousand sitting around I wouldn't touch some of the stuff that's on the market - a 2 bedroom flat for 250k? hell no.

&gt; I never understand how some prefer to complain about a problem and point a finger, instead of trying to resolve it themselves.

true,madeinacton,null,null,"What we have at the moment is unsustainable in the long term, a correction is needed and will happen thus my predictions are as follows:

House prices will have another short burst of increases leading up to the next general election as a result of Osbourne's policies, a lot of people will get sucked into high mortgages and investors will continue to buy up London prime property, inflating a further bubble waiting to pop. 

Housing stock will start to increase as people have a belief that everything is O.K again, there is demand and the private builders can get good margins on property over the next 2-3 years. 

The economy here will be recovering fairly well at this point with employment and growth at reasonable levels but inflation remaining stubbornly high. 

By 2016-2018 a number of things will happen, firstly interest rates will start to rise as the banks should be better capitalised to deal with defaults, inflation will need to be brought under control and investors will have a higher risk attitude, choosing to put their money into stock markets instead of bonds and extra QE will be out of the question, due to the strength of the economy and high inflation.

Europe will start bouncing back and investors will choose to buy up better opportunities outside of our over inflated market. As this happen's we'll also see a large amount of young Europeans returning to their home countries as the jobs market improves and they are able to get back onto their property markets which have deflated.

As interest rates rise (it will do so slowly) those most at risk will start to default and we'll see a large amount of over leveraged buy-to-letters have to declare their large portfolios bankrupt, putting a glut of homes on the market at once. All of this will have knock on effect and start to bring prices down considerably, but it will happen slowly, in line with interest rate rises so the bank can absorb the losses. 

I expect the first small rise will knock out a chunk of those over leveraged and prices will stop growing, then each rise after that will take more out and gradually only those that can afford to maintain their property at 3%+ interest rate will be left and prices will fall to level where this is viable for first timers. A lot of people not be wanting to sell due to negative equity, but will be able to service their mortgages.

I think the market will bottom out in 2020 and that will be when the economy starts to recover and grow sustainably over the next decade as first timers and those with cash decide it's cheap enough to enter the market again.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; Surely negative equity only matters if they intend to sell?

Yes, but they might have no option but to sell.

It really depends what triggers the fall in house prices.  The most likely cause will be an increase in the interest rate leaving people unable to pay their mortgages.  If they are forced to sell their house or the bank repossesses it then they may not be able to pay off the capital amount of the mortgage. 

A good indicator of the bank's faith in the property market can be see by looking at the deposit required to get a mortgage.  For example, on [this page](http://www.moneysupermarket.com/mortgages/) a 40% deposit is pretty much the standard for a mortgage these days.  That suggests the banks believe that house prices could drop by up to 40%.  As long as the values doesn't drop below 60% the bank can always repossess the house (the whole house of course, not just the 60% they paid for) and sell it to get their money back.  The house owner loses their 40% deposit, but that's of no concern to them.

Allowing for a margin of error, I wouldn't be at all surprised if house prices dropped 30% at some point over the next 5 years.  But of course, this is crystal-balling.  No-one can know for sure.  But the banks definitely aren't betting on house prices rising.  Quite the opposite.

Also, I think the two club's performances in the Champions League have to be acknowledged. I feel that Mkhitaryan offers more, shown in his goals and assists to Eriksen's but of course that's not everything. Many have made the point that Eriksen is too similar to Coutinho, in the sense that he's more of a creator than a finisher, which is one argument I've stood by in an explanation to why the club have seemingly chosen the Armenian to Eriksen. If there's one thing we lack at the moment it's a consistent amount of goals from midfield, while I think we can reply on the likes of Gerrard and Coutinho to supply the chances. So yeah, ultimately, Mkhitaryan seems likes a better fit for the club, especially if we are losing Suárez.

I agree that Dries Mertens is a great talent, but the suitability of his move here would have to be questioned. Would he demand a starting spot, I'd think so. Wages and transfer fee wise he outweighs Alberto. Couple that with the age difference and - for me - it's conclusive Alberto looks a better option. I for one would much rather have Sterling and Alberto fighting for a space, rather than Sterling be swamped by Mertens' ability and not have a look in into the first eleven.

You speak as if we already got Mkhitaryan and Luis Alberto. I am not saying we won't get them, just that as long as it is not official, I am not sure it is appropriate to make such a statement. 

My answer to your question: Brendan Rodgers has pointed out multiple times that he wants an additional attacking midfielder with a huge goal threat. I have to admit that all I know about Eriksen and Mkhitaryan is what I have read (in blogs etc) or seen on youtube as I don't watch the Eredivisie or the Ukranian PL but it seems as if Mkhitaryan could fill that role better than Eriksen, given his goal scoring record. 
And as far as Luis Alberto is concerned: he is a 20 year old with very decent potential who has had a magnificient loan spell at Barcelona B. Since FSG usually like to buy younger players I can see why we go for Luis Alberto instead of Mertens. Another thing concerning Mertens: he is already 26 and has not yet made the jump to a higher league even though he is a very highly rated player among football supporters. I think this might be a similar case as the Adam Johnson or Gaston Ramirez case where everybody just raved about these players yet no big club was in for them and look how it turned out for them.

As soon as prices start falling, property will no longer be a safe investment and those people will be selling their spare properties.

If you have plenty of time I could tell you my thoughts on many of the problems faced and caused by todays youth, such as an over dependancy on education, and not enough on self and productive disciplines.  

2. Please elaborate how my renting a house out is screwing people over? If you are going to say because I am perpetuating a system that promotes difficult pricing os something of that ilk, please allow me to apologise to you and everyone else out there how can't afford to buy a house. Honestly ask yourself this question though: If you have the opportunity to provide for YOUR children, would you not take it, and  would you not be driven to provide the best things possible for them?

3. Not realising how hard it is these days? I run a couple of businesses one of which supports 7 employees. 6 of them with families. Business is tough. Pulling enough money together at the end of every week so they can be paid is a difficult task. I often have to take less money each week so they get what they are due. I had to sell my car, went 6 years without going away for a holiday, sometimes even went a day or two without having a meal before I caught up and got married and started a family.

Don't ever accuse someone of not knowing how hard it is these days when you don't know who they are. Believe me, having upwards of 20 peoples livelyhoods on your shoulders is alot of stress.

My dates are wrong, but my point is correct - you bought on the end of a period where it was far easier to come by a deposit, when credit and mortgages were available to youngsters, which simply isn't the case now. Earnings have proportionally plummeted and house prices are up to 40% overvalued in the UK according to the OECD.


The fact you bought a property at just ~23 years old also makes me wonder whether you had some inheritance/mum/dad paying parts of it. 

At any rate, let me tell you this right now: **It is virtually impossible to buy a house at 24 years old now, without SUBSTANTIAL help from your family/inheritance etc.** If you walked into a bank these days, without a 10-20% deposit and a salary of about £30K at age 24 (which on a family home you could be talking about ~£30,000 deposit) you'd literally be laughed out the door by staff and customers alike - in the SE you just wouldn't get a house without that kinda of capital.

Your frugal living may have helped you buy a house in 2004, but no amount of frugality is going to help someone in the same position now.

Eriksen is another who is not yet entirely consistent. He'll certainly be a quality player, but we've got enough 'developing' players right now that I'm happy to see us go for someone who is already an established quantity like Mkhitaryan. Given how fucking young our whole squad is, the age of the player in this case is irrelevant.

Also, everything about Mkhitaryan screams leadership - this is a guy who lives at Shakhtar's training camp, handles the pressure of being the poster child for a not-so-blessed football country, and is an intelligent and professional footballer. After the giant void of losing Carragher, and with the potential departures of guys like Reina and Suarez, bringing in someone who immediately has a backbone of steel is invaluable.

Basically, in the UK, if you want to live like an actual adult the only option really is to buy. Raising children in rental properties would be a very risky stratergy - they'd end up like army brats, changing school every 12 months each time your contract comes up and the landlord wants you out.

It is because historically land owners (think of the word Land**lord**) were wealthy tradesmen and aristocrats who mattered in the eyes of the law... whereas their tenants were the lowly illiterate peasent scum who didn't. Even today in 2013 tenants are still legally treated like peasent scum. 

A good example is the section 21 notice (eviction notice). If you fail to pay rent, your landlord can secure a S21 notice from special courts setup to deliver them in around 4-8 weeks... if on the other hand you want to force your landlord to make critical repairs to their property which are a hazard to your **life**, you have to go through the council/courts - it could literally take 12 months just to be heard. Even then, the landlord is only obliged to make repairs based on a complex and vague set of criteria -- by which time your landlord will have already served you with notice at the soonest possible point in order to shut you up and stop you causing trouble. He can then go and get another set of tenants and do the whole thing again.

We are waiting for a huge headline scandal where a group of tenants die in a property that was inadequately maintained (something like a floor collapse) and all this comes into the public eye.

Don't get me wrong, predicting the weather is important, but as others here have pointed out, it's easier to predict the weather if you're looking at it over 10 years.

This ignores the whole point of weather forecasting, which is to know now what will happen soon. 

For a Brit, I get remarkably annoyed by the amount of weather forecasting everywhere. Some news programs seem to be ""The Weather, sponsored by the News"".

I put it down to cutbacks in spending since the weather is something that affects everybody, is easy and cheap to present, and the results are common across all outlets. Actual news is none of those things.

I can give you some background. We just finished the Premier League season with 72 points, the highest the club has ever gotten, but due to an unfortunate series of events, we finished in 5th place, just one point behind (our greatest rivals) Arsenal, meaning we won't qualify for the Champions League next season, and will be competing in the Europa League with other PL clubs Swansea &amp; Wigan.
Now, our star player is 23 year old attacking midfielder Gareth Bale. He is very, very good. Since we did not qualify for the champions league, there has been mass speculation that Bale will leave Tottenham for another club (Real Madrid seems to be the main contender), but we are optimistic that Bale will stay for a few reasons: 1. His love for our manager, Andre Villas-Boas (AVB) 2. His down-to-earth personality. We don't think money will be as important to him as something like team dynamic, which in my honest opinion, Tottenham has one of the strongest.
So, the summer transfer window closes in August, and we very much hope that Bale will stay with us for the upcoming season.
Aside from Bale, we are quite lacking in the striker department, and we're aiming to sign at least one good striker this summer, whether it be David Villa from Barca or Christian Benteke from Aston Villa, a striker is something we'll definitely need to succeed next season.
Another thing I can think of: we love Andre Villas-Boas, and we absolutely do not want him to leave. But he's been linked with moving to other clubs, like Paris St. Germain (PSG). We don't think this will happen this season however, since AVB has stated numerous times that he loves Tottenham, and wants to make the squad stronger next season. Now, some of our rivals Chelsea, ManCity, and Man United all will have new managers next season, so we're hopeful that keeping AVB will be key in securing a top-4 finish, as managerial stability is extremely important.

In terms of acting as a lender of last resort we are perhaps being too indecisive. 

We could have a completely free market for banks, with no government support / lending and allow firms to collapse if they screw up. This would mean banks going under and people losing their money, but the government staying clear. Some libertarians and Americans would support this, but there isn't an appetite for this in the UK.

Or we could have tight regulation to ensure high capital levels and prudence and also bail out banks in trouble. 

At present we have a terrible compromise where regulation was minimal but we bail out failed banks. So we get the worst of both worlds: taxpayer subsidies and reckless lending.

As you say we are essentially subsiding irresponsible lending.

Part of the problem is the sheer size of the banks, if there were 20 banks with 5% market share then we would have lost 3-5 and the rest would carry on.

true,Socky_McPuppet,null,null,"One of the biggest ""minor issues"" my USian friends ran into at UKC was plugs and voltage.  You undoubtedly have a variety of electrical and electronic devices you'll want to bring with you and plug in and/or charge up.

Just remember we use a very different style of plug in the UK, and our outlets deliver 240V.  You need to take *both* of these factors into account.

While many chargers today will work on any voltage between 100 and 250V, you must verify this before plugging it in.  For one of these devices, all you will need is a very simple adapter that just provides a physical way to connect a US-style 2- or 3-blade plug to British house current.  The device will then be operating on 240V, via the US-style plug.

For devices that do not operate on ""universal voltage"" (ie 100-250V or so), you will need an adapter that not only provides the physical connectivity, but which also steps down the 240V to the 110V your device needs.  You can often find these at ""travel specialty"" stores, just be aware that they typically do not provide a lot of power - many of them are limited to 100W or less.  That will be fine for plugging in a charger, clock-radio (although there again - there may be an issue.  US house current operates at 60Hz, British house current at 50Hz, so if your clock derives its time intervals from the mains frequency, your clock will show time running at 83% of its nominal rate) or *possibly* a curling iron, but will absolutely **not** operate a hair dryer, clothes iron, or large particle accelerator.

You've suddenly freed up 3/4 of the rental stock in the UK. 

You've also freed up a shit ton of capital to be invested in stuff that actually generates wealth. Rental income is awful; it functions purely to aggregate wealth to those with capital, with no employment in the middle and no work required to generate the revenue. It's an unearned, exploitative income stream that adds nothing to the economy, especially when the artificially high house prices it creates cause builders to sit on land plots and carve a huge great chunk out of average family incomes to pay for mortgages. 

House prices have to fall. They have to. No one gets wealthy from having an expensive house. If the average house is three times my salary, and I want to trade up to something 1/3rd. more desirable and therefore valuable, then I need to take a mortgage of one times my salary to bridge the gap. I pay 5% interest on that loan. 

If, however, average house prices are six times my salary, then not only does it take me longer to save a deposit, pay off the mortgage and I pay more interest in the mean time, the value of my house hasn't made me any richer at all. If I want to trade up to a house 1/3rd more desirable and so 1/3rd more expensive, I have to take a loan of twice my salary, paying 5% on that, which depending on the period of the loan leaves me paying three times more interest *minimum* than in the first case.

The only way to ""make money"" from a house is to downsize; taking the case of houses being more expensive, assuming that you bought with a mortgage, then you've paid more interest on it over the same time period due to its larger purchase price prior to sale, and are therefore worse off, but have recovered some of that by selling the house and downsizing to a less desirable place. However, had house prices been lower, you'd have been shot of that mortgage sooner or paid less interest on it, and then would have been able to save the money, without the opportunity cost of having it tied in a home or the bank's interest taking a slice of it (in fact you'd have recieved interest) plus you don't have to downsize your house to access that money. The great trick is that people's salary doesn't actually increase just because their house price goes up; they've still earned the same amount but paid more in to the house and so are in fact worse off. Money in a house isn't money; it's a sunk cost that you can't recoup because you will fundamentally always need a roof over your head. 

The only people who win are the banks, who make more interest on larger loans. 

High house prices also drive rent up, by increasing renter demand (it's harder for people to buy) and forcing landlords to charge more to sustain profit margins based on the fact they have bigger mortgages to pay if they're buy to let (which they all are, because you're stupid not to). 

In summary, there's already a class war, and the wealthy are winning it.

And that was the end.

Until just a few days ago Boggle returned and through an certain social networking site asked if anyone would like to hang out, it went a little like this.

Boggle: Is anyone coming out?

Items between the two games are pretty different, in that for the majority of heroes, items won't increase the strength of your abilities at all, only levelling the ability up will.

The pace will feel a lot different. Heroes have to take time to turn in this game as opposed to LoL where it happens instantly. This makes last hitting a bit more difficult. I've also found the animations generally are slower, so it just needs a bit more timing (if you play Dota for a while and go back to LoL, last hitting in that game is insanely easy...)

Mana is much more precious. For most heroes, you don't 'spam' your spells and trade during the laning phase (a few can, but most don't). Quite a lot of the spells should only be used when you know you're going to be able to get a kill or save yourself from dying by doing so, at least in the early game.

There's far more active items in this game than in LoL, so building to counter the enemy team is both easier and more complex (i.e. building a BKB can completely shut down certain heroes, or an Orchid will silence them. But there's much less general kind of 'I need MR now...').

Out of all of those, I think 4-2-3-1 is best for us on paper because we need 2 deep midfielders as a foundation for the attack. I really don't think Mhk is gonna play as an AM. I'd rather have him on the LW in Hendo's position/role. With his intelligence and speed, i think he's gonna give defenders a really hard time. With Coutinho pulling strings, we already saw some instances where we broke the back line with pace and a single pass. This will be even more devastating with Mhk on the wing. He's fast as fuck and can finish, and he is a very forward-thinking player. He'll be way more aggressive than Hendo is at LW and i imagine that he and sturridge will switch off coming deep for the ball, with the other person hanging off the back line waiting for a through ball and stretching the defense. 

Really don't want to see Coutinho taken off the CAM, I don't think Mhk is as creative as he is. Coutinho can be a box-box player, we've already seen him busting his ass on defense and making some smart interceptions. 

Also I just want to say that i feel like our chances of signing Mhkitaryan are slim. slimmer than signing eriksen.

I first bought a cheap terrace (16k!) in 1992 in a part of the country that no one wanted to live in, did it up and sold it for a bit more than I paid for it.  I then did the same to 6 more houses until I bought the one I'm in now in 2005 with the plan of doing it up from derelict in 2 years.  

Its a now a great house in a fantastic position but I don't think I could find a buyer at the moment for a price that would make the project break even let alone worthwhile.  No one seems to have any cash in the ""middle"" housing band. If I did managed to sell it, I don't think I could afford to buy anywhere round here that could accommodate my family as the kids get older.  If I did sell at the moment I would have to leave work, family and friends behind and start afresh in a different part of the country in order to do so.  I could rent it out but that would leave a shortfall on my rent on a larger place if I stay round here.  If I sold and moved to rental, I would get an indeterminate but reasonable sized lump sum but rental costs would be more than a mortgage.

Think of the market value of a house, how much would you need to borrow? 

If its £200,000 you'll be paying £8000-£10,000 per year to 'rent' that money from the bank (i.e. mortgage interest)
Add to that the fact you can invest your deposit to make money, you won't have any maintenance bills, you have location flexibility for work and then people quickly realise that buying isn't always the best choice.

A speciifc BTL mortgage does often have a higher deposit on it... but that isn't the only way of doing it, and there are ways around it to achieve lower deposits. If you are prepared to use the equity of your main home as collateral then even more borrowing is possible.

Current yields in the rental market are targeted at around 5%... so that would be the mortgage PLUS a 5% stipend on the investment each month... so in effect although the capital is tied up for the period of the mortgage, landlords are paying off a mortgage and still getting money on top.

It's insane - i've heard a few landlords talking like you and it's just amazing. I can think of no other industry where the LONG TERM returns are as high as they in BTL, for such an extraordinarily safe investment. Yes you could have some tenants smash up the place (which ought to be covered by insurance and/or their damage deposit) - but the risk of actually having the investment written off is pretty much non-existent.   

&gt; **You end up really not making much profit**

What you mean is, each month you don't take much money home... but at the end of the mortgage period you have turned £20K into a **quarter of a million pound** asset. That isn't the same as not making a profit... assuming even a 25 year mortgage if you work that out it equates to the equivalent of a 46% interest rate on the principle investment. Infact, you are technically earning £25 of interest every single day... for a £20K investment. It's off the hook and ought to be taxed a huge amount more than it currently is.

-----------Sturridge----------

-----Coutinho-----Suarez-----

--------Micky--Gerrard--------

------------Lucas-------------

Enrique--Agger--XXX--Johnson

He's looking at having Coutinho and Suarez play more inside and rely on Enrique/Johnson more for width.  Rodgers really likes that style and showcased it during the second half of his last season at Swansea (after getting Sigurdsson).  However, he didn't have 2 advanced central players.  He had Allen and Britton sitting deeper (Britton = Lucas, Allen = Stevie) to shield his defense and help provide a safe way for his full backs to get into the attack. 

I don't think it'll do very much good to push Stevie forward.  He's been outstanding sitting in there next to Lucas and if he advance his position we lose a fair bit of cover for our defense.  The OP rightly (IMO) points out that we have some very creative and intelligent attacking players and we should be trying to make sure we get the most out of all of them.  He wants to let them have the freedom to use their creativity.  A 4-2-3-1 with a fluid attacking 3 in behind the striker (exactly the way you have it in your post) opens the door for our intelligent and creative players to swap around and move across the pitch a lot, making them a nightmare for defenders to keep track of.  They're all smart and aware enough to keep an eye on each other so they don't get in each other's way and they can all benefit from the power that Sturridge brings as he leans on the last defender to try and create space for them to play in.  This is almost the same as what the OP is suggesting, it just provides more defensive cover and stability while in possession.  The attacking players have the same sort of freedom either way though.

Oh OK we're doing that are we? Grow up.

whose assumption? just pointing out there will always be a better safer way of engaging militarily

&gt; You've generated a false dichotomy in this debate where on one hand tortious liability will restrict commanders/policy

Yes it will - according to a senior military commander on radio 4 this morning

&gt; not fit for purpose

since the dawn of time and forever the military will find themselves in situations where they have equipment that is not fit for purpose. we have to deal with that reality.

&gt; And its expected of the military to take any risk to accomplish strategic objectives it? 

no, but it's expected that the military make those judgements, not the courts

&gt; Or are you talking out of your arse

nice.

&gt; You know this from years of service?

My family served in OP TELIC, and think this is a silly judgement

&gt; the military itself goes to great lengths to ensure casualties are minimal (the huge advances in effective treatment of battlefield casualties in Afghanistan is testament to this).

agreed - we have to ultimately trust them with the responsibility to get it right

&gt; Operation TELIC was a military expedition (with a sizeable international coalition) during peacetime from which we had every opportunity not to take part. There was no necessity to invade

agreed but it is a different point entirely, and i would probably support a case against the government who misrepresented the facts to justify invasion

&gt; so if our military was so woefully under-equipped 

we know *after the fact* that it was under-equipped. we did not know this before the fact - this is often the way with military engagements isn't it.

Well, reasonably. We don't even live in a democracy right now but some form of liberal state is what we're after really.

I think it's a bit dramatic to say we don't live in a democracy, but it's certainly not as good as it could be. The European Union is not democratic as it stands, and if we're to sign up to it (with the ultimate goal of a federal Europe like our European counterparts), we need and deserve a referendum that New Labour so disgustingly denied us. If we cannot get the reforms we need, then we're better off outside. However we really do want to stay in the EU.

&gt;To do that though we need to know the guy's at the top aren't becoming as corrupt as the US political establishment has. If they want to watch us then we have every right to view them with as much scrutiny as possible.

If you spin back in time 20 years - 1992 - the housing market collapsed almost overnight. Lots of people were in negative equity.

Why was that so disastrous then and what's different now? Because the thing that led to the housing market collapsing was a massive rise in the base rate of interest. Combine that with fixed-rate mortgages being comparatively rare at the time, suddenly the house you live in doesn't cost you, say, £400/month. It costs you £800/month. The house takes longer to sell - partly because mortgage rates are through the roof (=fewer first time buyers), partly because lots of other people are in the same boat (=greater supply of houses).

Why hasn't the base rate risen? Because the base rate is no longer set by the Chancellor of the Exchequer for political reasons, it's now set by the Bank of England.",0,1371657431,null,0,false,0,calziyd,t3_1gn7pu,t1_calziyd,t1_calvluf,null,1430756624,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

For the record, I believe electrical goods supplied by the landlord already have to be PAT tested. 

My last place was only single-glazed, however, and in the winters I either spent a fortune on heating or suffered chilblains (or, likely, both).

I would obviously like to see landlords required to double-glaze properties like mine, add insulation, &amp;c (obviously there'd need to be an exclusion for listed buildings).

However, IMO, all this is a side-effect of capitalism. You'd defend to the death the right of people to own and inherit property, but under this system it's only natural for wealth to accumulate in the hands of a minority.

This is the nature of disposable income - if food, rent and utilities cost £1000 a month, then someone earning £1100 has £100 to spend on entertainment &amp;/or bettering themselves. Someone earning £2200 is not merely twice as well off, but has 12x the disposable income!

This creates a barrier to entry that ensures those over a certain level of wealth or income pull away, ahead of the pack, creating an ever-increasing wealth inequality.

IMO it indicates your political/economic/social system is broken if you need to go meddling and tinkering all the time with new rules to ~~placate the peasantry~~ prevent wealth from accumulating too much in the hands of a minority.",0,1371659359,null,0,false,0,cam0a52,t3_1gn7pu,t1_cam0a52,t1_calvnff,null,1430756268,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Reposted from the original threat, but fuck it:

Let's start with a list of things that actually made it into the news:

http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/5914/Sex-scandal-rocks-top-school.html - teacher/student - the usual.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/4420822.stm - fee fixing.

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2252049/Paul-McCaffery-Teacher-private-school-hanged-home-losing-job-heavy-drinking.html - this was one suicide that made the news. I know of two others. One a guy in my year who I suspect was gay, who couldn't face coming out in that sort of environment.

Then this vile man, who has absolutely no shame about being a sadist who wanted to hit children and defending his position in the media, was also a teacher there: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K_ydIi0TXM

Who appeared on a TV programme about returning educational standards to those of the past: http://www.teachem.co.uk/third-series/staffroom/headmaster/

He gave the impression of appearing as a strict disciplinarian, but also used to dress up as Gary Glitter, and had a private connection that meant he could take his favourite pupils to tours of Top of the Pops. Yeah... about that...

I've been waiting for his name to appear as part of the Yewtree investigations, but whilst he said a few things to me that with hindsight I was see were creepily flirtatious in a very warped way, I've no direct evidence he sexually abused children, although I believe he was actually questioned by the police, but obviously I'm not privy to the reasons why or circumstances. He was certainly quite open about wanting to hit kids, though, and has even written about the merits of 'bringing back the cane' in newspapers too. Some of the punishments he actually did devise and implement were perverse and would have had him sacked from any school that wasn't an isolated, archaic nightmare.

Issues... I has 'em... because of this cunt.

However. Things do get even odder, and take this with a pinch of tinfoil.

There were several genuine child abuse rings, which teachers at the school could be tangentially linked to:
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1308797/Boarding-school-head-Derek-Slade-guilty-abusing-boy-pupils-punished-sexual-motive.html

Evidence for a cover-up conspiracy: http://brynalynvictims.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/derek-slade-st-georges-school.html

One or more teachers, and I won't name names, who were at the school run by the chap that's the focus of this article.

One of the people named in this article also worked at the school I attended:
http://www.newburytoday.co.uk/2012/former-crookham-court-school-teacher-guilty-of-historic-child-abuse

It's tempting to look for links between teachers and schools, and there are some links that suggest that abusers were operating in some kind of organised way. 

Aside from the actual convictions, that's only through secondary evidence, circumstances and suspicion however, not primary sources.

Now - and here's where the going gets really weird - the school was run by freemasons, most of the male staff were freemasons, and it became apparent that there was a hierarchy there that didn't quite align with the normal hierarchy that you'd expect in a school.

Oh, and there were tunnels and large underground rooms. I know this, because I saw them and sneaked into them. Their existence wasn't denied, but we were warned to stay out of them because of 'asbestos'.

What I did see in them was a large scale model of the school, possibly an original architects' model, and a load of stuff that I think may have been masonic paraphernalia, like a high backed chair and locked boxes. Nothing intrinsically wrong with freemasonry or even having masons run schools, but it seemed to add an opaque layer to proceedings, that's just really not healthy in education.

Oh, and the head of history was shagging the school secretary for years, one of the housemasters was shagging a matron, there was booze and drugs everywhere that the staff didn't even begin to have the slightest clue about, the band master had a gigantic stash of porn in the band room, and there were shitloads of injuries that should have been avoidable, and dangerous pranks going on all of the time.

TL;DR - My school had loads of scandals and was completely mental. Some scandals were very newsworthy. I think (with tinfoil hat firmly on) there may have been a conspiracy to cover up child abuse rings and protect abusers linked with a few other schools, that didn't always work very well.

Shit was fucked up, man.

As a replacement, Luke Shaw. Loan him back to Southampton, or maybe even a championship club for more regular game time, with a recall clause obviously. However, I have more faith in Pellegrini regarding youngsters than I did in Mancini, so if he kept Shaw at the club, assuming he bought him, Shaw would learn from Clichy and get regular games in the FA + League Cup under Pellegrini.

true,MiniPenguino,lfc99,,"Let's break this down because I'm actually getting worried with our reckless spending. 

Carra's wages will probably go right to Toure. 

Carroll gave us +£15m. 

Aspas takes away £7.7m. So we have £7.3m left. 

Out targets are:

Alberto, Papa, Miggy, Sporting CP Defender (the fuck's his name again?), and Micky. 

Alberto is apparently around £7m. Papa will be around £15m. Miggy will be around £10m. SCP is £5m (?). Micky is wrapping up now and will be around £20m. 

If this happens, we will have spent £64.7m and sold only £15m in assets. Now we're £49.3m in the red. So how do we cover this?

Suarez is still uncertain, but apparently he has a release clause (Read; Complete bullshit, but seems an appropriate price for him) of £40m. 

Reina is a value of £12m, but clubs seem to be wary because he is statistically not one of the worse keepers in the league. His reputation and command though keep his price up. 

Downing could easily go for around £7-£10m. 

Shelvey? Fuck. He could be on the chopping block for £5m, but unlikely. 

Coates, no matter how much I don't think he's been given a fair shout, is also in risk. Could be gone for around £6m. 

Add that all together and we have something around £70m to sell. Add that to Carroll's £15m and we have £85m approximately in assets to sell. 

So if these are the only transfer targets, we could have a profit of £20.3m. I would resist selling Reina, Coates, or Shelvey, but that might happen. 

I guess we may be more secure than I thought. My only hope is we stop with reckless uneven spending and gross wages. Getting Carroll, Downing, Suarez, and Reina off saves somewhere around £350,000 per week. So that helps.

Oh, and some kids got suspended (I think) because they made a Facebook group about how much they hated one of the teachers. It got a shit tonne of members including a load of ex students. To be fair, the teacher was a right cunt. There was also a rumour that someone kegged a teacher (I think it might have been the same one) in the middle of class once.

Edit: Another one, this time from sixth form - Not exactly a scandal, but I know that several people completed the 'John Guy Challenge'. This entailed having sex in the toilets in the 'John Guy' building (the toilets there are particularly small and close to classrooms). The more extreme version of this (which I'm somewhat glad has never been completed) is called the 'Simon Jarvis' challenge. The goal is to have sex in the main quad, take pictures and send them to the head (Simon Jarvis).

About the same number of plumbers and builders are going to be employed regardless of the number of landlords. The demand for them depends on the number of properties, not on the number of landlords.

If anything, having ""amateur landlords"" better empowers self-employed builders and plumbers - if landlords hold dozens or hundreds of properties the maintenance staff become employees, who then have less wage bargaining power (and who will nevertheless probably still be expected to come out in the middle of the night if flooding occurs). 

Irrespective of this, meddling in the economy should not be a primary purpose of government.

I'm inclined to the view that small landlords are going to be more sympathetic to the needs of their tenants.

You're basically advocating for further corporatisation of the rental sector - as a Thatcherist yourself, surely you should be advocating individual access to investment!

If you further corporatise landlords, they're not going to become more sympathetic to renters' problems - instead profits will become more about the bottom line and maximising return for investors, who are now at a remove from the property and who can remain blissfully unaware of the problems they cause. Meanwhile corporate landlords will have better lobbying power to erode tenant rights.

If you want ""sympathy and empathy"", just legislate stronger rights for tenants. Bang! Problem solved (for now).",0,1371665792,null,0,false,0,cam2ywe,t3_1gn7pu,t1_cam2ywe,t1_cam1q8d,null,1430755001,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

There was this kid at the school who was a wizz with computers and a housemaster, my housemaster, asked him to fix his laptop for a knockdown price. He agreed and took it home. In the process of fixing it he took some private photos of my housemaster's wife naked and also some risqué photos of him his wife and another couple of teachers from the school. I say risqué because I never actually saw them, I had a tonne of respect for the guy by this point, my final school year, and I wasn't about to ruin it. Nonetheless it sounds like from what I heard no-one was naked in the photos involving the other couple nor was there any sex.  Probably just some 30 something people getting drunk and acting like they were still 20 something. I think there was one of one wife pretending to suck off her husband. Anyway, the kid got expelled for taking the private information and a bunch of people saw a hot teachers tits so I guess it's kind of win win. 

EDIT: I should make it clear the the 2 wives were also teachers at the same school and were the hottest teachers there by an absolute mile. Naturally news and images spread fast.

The second involves the chaplain of the school (yes, I was privately educated if you hadn't noticed, we had chaplains and masters). He was also a reservist navy officer and was head of the CCF at the school. He got the navy section of the CCF onto a navy trip to the Caribbean provided and paid for by the RN/MOD. However he added an extra person onto the roster who was a friend of his and wanted a trip in the Caribbean. Long story short he was found out and would rather resign than face coming back. He was a dick anyway, if any man of the cloth was going to defraud the MOD it was going to be this douche.

I left home at 19 in 1987, and shared a bedsit with 3 other guys. Even back then, I was paying a quarter share of £200 (about £475 in todays money), but as I'm not sure what area you're in, it might well be comparative.

We had ONE bedroom, and had to lay 4 mattresses side by side to sleep. The living area / kitchen was about the same size, and bathroom facilities was a shared bath / toilet with two other bedsits.

In the period 1987 to 1995, I've lived in bedsits, leaking attics, my brothers couch (for two years), and once I escaped the shithole that is UK, I lived 4 years in a portacabin while working in the desert.

Since then, I've been living with my wifes parents for another 10 years, something that'll take you all the way to madness and back again. All the time paying my way, nothing has come for free.

So 23 years, scrimping and saving until I had enough money to buy land and build a house on it. It's been damned hard, trying to put away 25% of my wages consistently for almost a quarter of a century, but it's been worth it.

Hell, even if you ARE working, there's no shame in sharing ... why do you feel the need to ""rent your own place"" ? That's a luxury I've NEVER had, and I've worked consistently for nigh on 28 years now. Like I said, in my day, we wouldn't think twice about sharing ... now it seems like you want sympathy for doing the same thing ? And between four of you, not one of you has the nounce to maybe fix the fuses or repair the leaks ? Or are you content to wait until doomsday for a landlord to do it, even though you know he won't ?

The idea goes like this: there are points in time where something has to happen, where there is no way of changing it.  Think the classic example of Twilight Zone episode where the guy goes back in time to kill Hitler and is himself thwarted - time itself, or the Universe, whatever, requires that this event happen.  Nobody, not even a Timelord, can change that without seriously bad consequences - ie, paradox, universe unravels, etc.

The reason is pretty vague and best explained as: not even Timelords fully understand why, and they understand time.  How could we possibly explain it to you?

true,OverPaidChimp,eng-nottinghamshire,Not'num,"Haha, I was waiting for a thread like this to bring this up. Two juicy scandals for you!

Both of these took place within the same Catholic school, the first of which involved my own form tutor who was also head of R.E (He was a major league bible-basher). I had him from year 7 to January year 8 and then one day he mysteriously disappeared. The school did a surprisingly good job at keeping it quiet, but immediately rumours started appearing from the year tens. According to them he had an 'affair' with a year ten girl.

Of course being the innocent little members of year 8 we didn't believe the rumours. Well, turns out it was true, some point later in that year somebody posted [this article](http://www.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/Teacher-s-inappropriate-texts-girl-15/story-13083841-detail/story.html#axzz2WgaynNZj) on facebook and he really had this 'affair' with the girl. Perhaps not quite to the extent that you'd imagine. In reality he had just exchanged some 'inappropriate' messages with this girl and he was fired as soon as he was discovered. The funny thing is these messages weren't even sexual they were just comically creepy.

The second scandal involved the school chaplain. He was well trusted in the school and had been there for quite a long time. Just after the summer holidays began the coach returned from the yearly Lourdes trip and as soon as this guy got off the bus he was arrested with the charge of sexual assault of a former member of the school (I was recently informed that the boy was coaxed into receiving a blow-job from him, he was 14). At this point the boy was now 18 and had spoken up about it. The difference this time was that everybody knew about it and yet the school tried to keep it quiet (which is a scandal in itself). 

These two articles tell you the rest of the story: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-13300692

http://www.ilkestonadvertiser.co.uk/news/crime/pervert-chaplain-jailed-for-a-year-1-3371420

The chaplain was let out after a year but went back in very shortly afterwards after it was discovered that he had child porn in his possession. Also, this isn't confirmed yet but I recently heard that he had died of cancer and school actually said a prayer for him or something.

TL:DR : R.E teacher fired from teaching for two years for inappropriate messages with yr 10 girl. Chaplain imprisoned for paedophilia. 

Edit: Damn, I just remembered that I got an important detail wrong, the incident that the chaplain was convicted for happened when the boy was 18 and there was another incident that happened when he was 14 but it wasn't proven.",0,1371668141,null,0,1371668414,0,cam3x09,t3_1gnlh6,t1_cam3x09,t3_1gnlh6,null,1430754555,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

All my old school would say was ""We'll put it in the post"". The only coursework i received from that school was from my old English teacher. She had taken it upon herself to find out from my old class mates where i was now at school, and personally drove there to hand it over. She said she did it because she 'didn't trust (my old school) to get it to me'. Unfortunately English was the only subject where my old coursework no longer applied, as they had automatically moved me to the bottom class and on to the foundation paper at my new school, because it said on my record that i'm dyslexic. 

I finally heard from my old school about my coursework the week it had to be in. All they could say was they'd 'lost it'. I aced all my exams, but without the coursework was just below the grades they wanted to let me into sixth form. 

Four years later, i've been to art college, which has gotten me nowhere, and i work grueling hard labour as a tree surgeon's groundsman (basically, heaving branches about all day), to afford half the rent on a 2m*2m room in my girlfriends sisters house.

I wanted to be a scientist.

TL;DR: Lack of school to school communication and organisation completely destroyed my career path, also, my maths teacher had a breakdown, locked himself in the cupboard and conducted the rest of the lesson from there.

- General torture of teachers in creative ways. One example was the time we unscrewed every table in the maths classes at lunch so they all fell apart when we came in afterwards. The poor substitute almost passed out from anxiety.

- The day the guy that kept claiming to have a machete brought one in to prove it.

- two students dying and another two injured in a car crash when they drove into a wall

- Maths/Physics teacher being jailed for having sex with a couple of (hot) girls, and trying to fuck another two. The headteacher 'took early retirement' over the whole thing

- New headteacher came in to shake things up. Got people to sit exams a year early in some big educational experiment. The whole year failed, and he also had to take 'early retirement'

- New school building got set on fire before it was even completed

- Our school went to war with pupils who wore 'hoodies' when the black alternative music ones became popular. Local schoolgirl killed herself infamously after being relentlessly teased by yobs for being a 'goth'. Marilyn Manson did a tribute. The local school in question got a storm of abuse in the press, and our school dropped the whole thing from then on.

Sure everyone takes bits and pieces from friends, family, and stories. People have inside jokes and then there are things that are universally funny; they all come from a sense of shared experience and we wouldn't have that without sharing. We use fiction to share our views on what the world should or shouldn't be and we find common values. I think the Doctor has a lot to be admired for. I think there are a lot of values in the show that are true and virtuous and I think that is great. The Doctor would be an amazing person to hang out with if it weren't for one major hang up: he's fictional. You, KiwiHuey, are real, which means you are already infinitely more interesting than the Doctor could ever be. You are flesh and blood and you feel and break and breathe and scream. Not every decision you make is discussed for weeks around a writer's table, you  make gut reactions, you make mistakes, you surprise yourself and you do it all in real time. We all take bits and pieces from other people and incorporate them into ourselves, we wouldn't be able to communicate without it. The key though is to take them sparingly and once you have them to make them your own so that you can share them with one another. That is how we live on through eternity is in how we affect the people and the generations that come after us. Everyone goes through hardships and has a rough go of it at times, and it's good to look for solutions to our problems in the outside world, people need help, we can't do everything on our own. The key is in how you take and apply those solutions. How you react to them and utilize them is what makes you who you are and the more risk you take in that and the more of yourself you inject into those decisions the stronger and more confident you will become.",0,1371671596,null,0,false,0,cam5bmw,t3_1gnxvi,t1_cam5bmw,t3_1gnxvi,null,1430753822,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

We failed our Ofsted inspection after becoming an academy and our principal just disappeared, and we made [BBC news](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-16595105) because of the Ofsted thing. The principal was meant to leave at the end of July but didn't show up at all in the few weeks before Christmas after everyone in the school knew how bad we did, because the official report was released about two months late.  
We then got a new principal but she was fired recently and everyone was kept in the dark. Before Easter she told staff in a meeting that she'd ""see them after the holidays"" and then that evening she was called to a meeting in London and given the chop. The third principal since the academy replaced the old school was appointed recently, (he's quite a nice guy and has a photographic memory) but he was suspended from his old school on assault charges so some people weren't too happy about hearing he'd be the principal.

There was rumours (although this was only in the school - no news got hold of it) that a teacher was cheating on his wife with a teacher at the school, but then ended up being gay. He then left the school years later and was apparently asked to leave after getting a bad rating from Ofsted.

true,I_Have_Hairy_Teeth,null,null,"I am going to give you the best advice here. I have had to use a throwaway for this.

Parking in a private car park does not give them any scope to give you a ticket. These are advertised as 'Penalty Notices' or 'Penalty Charges' or some other bollocks. These are nothing but invoices which legally do not need to be paid. If you get one of these notices, ignore it. DO NOT respond to them at all. DO NOT give them your details or call them. Doing so gives them your information for free which they would generally have to pay for through a form sent to the DVLA which costs them money.

Ignoring this means they have to pay for the release of the information of the v% registered owner of the vehicle who they say has an obligation to find out who the driver was on the day you were 'charged'

They will then send official looking documents to your house looking for the money for the charge notice, but keep ignoring them altogether, they will go away.... trust me.

At no point has any private parking charge in Scotland ever gone to court. In England you might be fucked, but Scotland is different. If they did take you to court, all they could charge you for is 'actual loses' incurred on the business by you being parked in the space. There are always free spaces, so this is essentially £0.00. They cannot recuperate their legal costs in this as it is a civil matter!!

The next time you are in Lidl and they ask you if you have brought your car, do as I do and say that it is none of their business whatsoever. I have taken numerous charges from them and have never paid a thing. The only downside is the letters through the post which you should put straight in the bin. Occasionally they will send out a new letter with a different header (to make it look like a debt collectors letter), but still.... IGNORE IT!!!

Do not give in to their requests as if you pay the APPR charge, they will have your details through their private parking company who will share this information with other private parking enforcement companies.

Note: the only private parking in Scotland you have to pay for is Local Authority (Council) parking and private parking firms who have a barrier in order to enter/exit. Ignore everything else at all costs if you want to park for free.

If you want any additional information on this, give me a shout as I used to work for local government parking enforcement in Stirling a long time ago and the law have not changed.",0,1371673068,null,0,false,0,cam5wzg,t3_1fzggn,t1_cam5wzg,t1_cafbhnf,null,1430753542,2,false,dundee,t5_2sh1y,2

They aren't going to sue for physical injury or death alone, they will sue for negligence for which anyone with a duty of care to someone else may be held liable. The army has been sued before for negligence but never for negligence relating to combat operations. 

The men may accept that they are in danger they are provided with equipment by the MOD and if they die because the MOD failed to give them any body armour or to armour their vehicles then why not allow them to sue. Besides we won't know whether they succeed until their cases come to court individually. The court will probably set a high standard for this type of negligence where the army seriously let down their soldiers causing their deaths.

1. blame being apportioned to us as tenants in a house I lived in last year when we had a mouse and fly infestation. We were very clean and tidy and there is no way we would have let that happen due to any negligance on our part! They made us pay for everything to be sorted out with environmental health etc. and went on about how this was a problem every year and that they didn't understand how such nice educated students could live such disgusting lives to attract vermin. Great. Thanks. Maybe you need to fix the problem then?

1. In my first rented house my landlord went absolutely crazy insane angry when I rang him up (not for the first time!) to complain about damp in the house, but specifically my bedroom. I had water coming in the top corner where the wall met the ceiling, and damp absolutely everywhere. It was so bad that my bedclothes grew mildew in the space of 48 hours over a weekend when I went home to recuperate from a nasty chest infection. Getting it fixed was bad enough but it was the attitude from him that made it even harder. He used to complain that he lived too far away to come down to see the house. How is that my problem? I'm paying through the nose - it was nearly one and a half times my student loan for the rent alone (pretty much market rate standard). No bills, just rent. The least he could do would be to not bitch about how far away HIS rental property is from his mansion farmhouse 250 miles away.

1. This is a general gripe: not having any control over furnishings. This sounds really petty, but it would be such a relief not to have the carry the burden of 'oh, shit, am I going to get charged for wear and tear on my bed at the end of my contract?'. Most landlords aren't happy about you bringing in your own furniture as it messes up their insurance for fire etc, and I find it stressful living my day to day life around furniture that is not my own, and not of my own choosing. Obviously this makes breakages a) more likely (as it's cheap shitty furniture) and b) so much worse because you can't patch it up and make do or replace like it is your own.

1. Joint tenancy agreements are the absolute pits. Just because you rent a room in a house with other people, quite often strangers, does not mean you are in anyway capable of taking on responsibility for THEIR rent. I can go into this further but I fear this post is already too long!

So those are just some snippets of bad experiences. Council tax is another one of my bugbears - I don't have a problem with the tax in principle, but renting mixed students/professionals makes it a tricky one to sort out.

true,JesusofBorg,null,null,"Where to begin...

1. From the Devil's perspective, God is evil. Just because your enemies label you with nicknames that have evil connotations does NOT mean you are evil. It means said enemies are so deluded as to believe that their actions are actually good, much like how the Daleks, Cybermen, Sontarans and everybody else joined forces to imprison the Doctor in the Pandorica. They truly believed that imprisoning the Doctor was for the ""good"" of the Universe. Just because you think your actions are for the ""good"" of something, doesn't mean they are. The road to hell is paved with good intentions, after all...

2. The entire Valeyard thing seriously needs to be forgotten. For one, the Doctor no longer has a ""final"" regeneration, as it's been pretty much stated as fact that he's now [immortal](http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2010/oct/12/doctor-who-immortal-reveals-bbc). Then, add on to this the show's ""wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey""-ness and repeatedly stated fact that ""Time can be rewritten"", and it becomes glarringly obvious that the Valeyard is no longer a threat to the Doctor in any way, shape, or form. Even if he does show up again, he's been defeated by the Doctor at every step. What proof do you have that he won't just do it again and again and again?

3. Hurt's Doctor is the real 9th ""Doctor"", meaning Eccelston = 10th, Tennant = 11th and Smith = 12th. This has also already been stated as fact. So, unless they did so specifically to hide the truth, then it's safe to say that Hurt's Doctor != the Valeyard.

The Doctor, like all Time Lords, suffers from arrogance and complacency. It takes concerted effort on his part to not end up like the rest of his people. This is why he always takes a companion. It forces him to use his abilities to show people how good he can be instead of sitting around inside the TARDIS being a selfish old bastard. THAT is why Hurt's Doctor ended up being ""evil"". He's the truest ""Time Lord"" version of the Doctor that has ever existed. A self-righteous jackass with near godlike power, just like every other Time Lord he locked away in the Time War.

Ive got a few.

* Our P.E teacher fucked a sixth former, but it never was confirmed, as the girl wanted it, and didn't say anything. Then the same P.E teacher sexually assaulted one of his athletes at a school dance. She did press charges. He got beaten up by some year 11's and sacked. He had a wife and two children at this point too, he didn't when the first one happened.

* We also had a Math's teacher who fucked a student, he got sacked for strangling a kid who made fun of him for it. Recently he started messaging her on Facebook publicly declaring his love for her and that if she didn't love him and be with him he was going to kill her. My friend actually has the whole conversation screenshotted if anyone is interested in seeing it.

* On the football tour to Barcelona these kids threw food at a waitress. Our P.E teacher (not the first one). Made it up to her, by shagging her, a few people walked in on her showering in his room. He also bagged the hot swimming coach we had. Needless to say he was pretty fucking cool, even if we did hate him for stealing away our dreams of banging the swim coach in the changing rooms.

* A sad one, but we had a teacher get stabbed and killed, heres the news story: http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/teacher-stabbed-to-death-with-his-garden-shears-581856

When dealing with public bodies and institutions the court will give them a lot of leeway when it comes to budgets. If the tech was the best at the time or there was not enough money then the court will probably decide there is no liability. However the human rights issue means the court must be extra careful given a breach of human rights a pretty big deal, though TBH I think the human rights claims are fairly weak.

It's a giant pile of rocks and you can't get nearer than 20 feet to them. Go, and take pics, but also I would like to encourage you (since you'll be near) to visit Salisbury. The cathedral is amazing. The high street/shopping area is pretty cool, and there are plenty of nice places to eat. 

Also, while you're in the South, if you have extra time, go see Winchester. The Round Table is there (Henry VIII's version), and it too has a neat high street and lovely stuff to see and eat. The Cathedral is cool too.

While you're wending your way North, consider York. It's very pretty and if you're into Steampunk, nearby Whitby is funk heaven. I can personally recommend Eden House B&amp;B in Pickering (which is also a cute town). We stayed there this summer for the British Juggling Convention and the owner was lovely, as was the breakfast.

It's pretty touristy though :/  


But if you're looking for something a bit more off the beaten track try [the Norfolk Broads!] (http://gouk.about.com/od/uknationalparks/ss/uknationalparks_12.htm)

Summary: Basically 400 years ago people needed fuel for burning, and peat was found in the surrounding area of the city in Norfolk county (Norwich), so people started digging up lots of peat from the ground. Norfolk is a very flat place, with a lot of rivers, and when they all flooded, the peat 'quarries' filled with water, and linked all the rivers together creating a unique waterway with miles of untouched landscapes! 

Very unique place. 

Basically it's in Norfolk which is the Eastern sticky outy bit of England, only a quick 1 hour train journey from Cambridge to Norwich (a medieval town, in which I live) which has a BEAUTIFUL [cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwich_Cathedral) and a rather unique and cuboid [castle](http://www.beenthere-donethat.org.uk/images.big/norwich052big.jpg) from Norman times. 

I personally reccomend you visit *How Hill* in Norfolk if you do decide to come here, it's got all the good bits of the broads in one place, and if you can try and get on to the [Electric Eel Boat trip](http://www.enjoythebroads.com/things-to-do/electric-eel-boat-trip) which takes you through lots of little unexplored waterways which is really good fun!

Also, if you're looking for a typical English Pub and you ARE in Norfolk, try the 'Surlingham Ferry Boat' in Surlingham (give it a google), very traditional Englishy and on the river so it's beautiful at sunset, and you can sample the local Norfolk tipple (Woodforde Ale).  

I'm sorry if I splurged a bit, but I love my County and city, and it doesn't get a huge amount of credit for being just generally a nice place to be! 

Not to sound creepy or stalkery or anything, but if you *do* come to Norwich, just drop me a private message, and I'd be very happy to show you around!

So we have tax due of £70k. You have ten years to pay it, so that's £7k p/a plus interest you need to find (interest on IHT payments is currently 3%). 

We're assuming here that all the properties have no outstanding mortgages, if more than £175 was outstanding then there'd be no IHT due at all. If there's £100k outstanding then there'd be £30k to pay.

If the executors have a house of their own they now have three rental properties each earning between £600-1000 p/m. Lets be conservative and say £2000 total per month, or £24000 per year.

Minus the £7000 for the yearly IHT contributions, plus maybe an extra £1000, and they're still left with £16000 p/a on the three properties. After management fees, maintenance and tax you can probably remove another 25% of that.

Assuming they buy no more houses over their lifetime *their* kids will still inherit *four* properties.

But lets face it, if you're earning £12k per year on top of your regular job you could afford to buy an extra house every ten years or so ...and that's if you're saving up and paying cash for each one. You could buy far more if you refinanced and used the equity on your existing properties as collateral.

true,Variola13,,EtOH,"&gt;He was hardly anywhere near breaking the rules in this discussion until after you started responding to him, so there would be no enforcement needed here if you hadn't started fighting with him

Re read that thread, you are spot on in that the rudeness only came after I was responding to him, my initial comments were not rude or offensive and only changed after he started being a twat to me. 
He doesn't like being challenged, I told him I take issue with calling anyone weak, fitness and weight issues are very personal, and often linked with mental health.  I specifically told him I was not interested in what he was doing several times yet still he persisted going on about what he did, even though the thread was not about him. 
 Even now, in his comments to you he is bullshitting about what I did and didn't do in the thread, blatant lies saying I was pestering people in the thread about their exercise, even though I only spoke to him and one other poster. 

&gt;So again I ask you, would it be possible for you to visit this subreddit and chat to other people while ignoring Peter's comments?

I thought I had made it fairly clear that I wasn't going to participate in here? Ergo it is a moot point. 

&gt;And yes I'm mostly giving my own opinion

Thank you for the clarification. 

&gt;but all the mods are working towards trying to maintain a nice friendly atmosphere in the pubreddit

And most of the time it is, its a real breath of fresh air compared to /r/uk etc. That is until one person decides to spoil it, as he always does. 

&gt; in my conversations with both you and Peter, it seems that he would like more freedom to be offensive, and you would like stricter moderation,

Other than this and one or two modmails we have not had a conversation as such, so although you may be happy to accomodate Sutcliffes wants, you don't really know mine as you are way off the mark I am afraid. It is not my reddit, I am not a panelist,  I don't really frequent it like I used to (for reasons I have explained) so it doesn't worry me whether you moderate more strictly or not, its not up to me. All I am saying is if you let someone behave like a twat and excuse it away as 'oh that is how he is' then do not be surprised when people get pissed off by him.

The headmaster was very chummy with us. He'd sit us on his lap and act as if he was our best friend. You felt he respected you. Pretty empowering when you're a 9 year old.

Towards the end of my first year there, he married the mother of a pair of his students. I remember thinking that was a bit odd, but whatever. He invited my parents, my brother and myself around for a dinner in his big old house. We played Mega Drive with the other kids, and they seemed happy as anything.

In the summer holidays, we received a letter saying that the school was changing it's name. My parents wouldn't tell me why. That didn't matter, I soon found out from a friend. The headmaster had been arrested. He was a major player in an international child pornography ring.

At the beginning of the next year, the police came into the school and sat us down. They asked us if he'd ever touched us. I got shivers down my spine thinking about all the times he perched me on his lap. Luckily, I don't remember anyone saying that he had done anything worse than that.

Apparently he served around 10 years. I know the next bit sounds a bit Daily Mail, but I was told it with some authority. When he got out he moved to another part of the country, and then managed to open another school. I was told that if it's a private school, you don't need any particular checks. Obviously he wouldn't pass a CRB check, but I don't know how that would work.

Had a girl at my school who claimed to be having a relationship with a teacher. 

Now, he was a weed so that was plausible but she was super fat so it was unlikely.

Anyway, her best friend told me about it as we were friends too. I thought ""Hmm I better tell her that these rumours could be really dangerous."" So I told her I'd heard the rumour, she told me to shut up or it'd ruin everything.

Next day at school I get called to the room of a teacher in his department (and this fat girls registration teacher) where I get absolutely roasted. Completely destroyed for making this rumour up. How I could ruin lives, ruin his career, how I should be ashamed of myself as I was a good kid but had made stupid choices. Basically everything a 14 year old, fairly good kid, does not want to hear. I was facing expulsion, despite having not actually done anything.

FINALLY, it was my turn to speak. I told him that I wasn't the one who made up the rumour, that she was and I had told her to stop telling people this lie.

He just said ""Get out of my sight"" and I walked back to my reg class, feeling absolutely shitty. I got through the double doors, heard his door shut and a ""WHY THE HELL DID YOU MAKE THIS UP? DO YOU REALISE I'VE JUST SPENT THE LAST 10 MINUTES ABUSING ONE OF MY FAVOURITE PUPILS IN THIS SCHOOL? ALL BECAUSE OF YOUR LIES?""

Felt much better after that. No trouble for me, loads for her. Yeehaa.

He then goes rustling through his backpack, I see some baggies that look like pound bags.

He then pulls out a baggy of shrooms.

I then realized they were mushrooms and go ""Mikey, why the fuck would I want to eat mushrooms, why would anyone buy this when they could get a pound bag"".

* One of the lab assistants caused a massive chemical spill in the chemical cupboard. We had no idea what chemicals were involved but the whole school was evacuated into one block.

* We had an alcoholic maths teacher. In his earlier years he was known to keep spirits in his cupboard which was locked. He stopped drinking whilst teaching when he taught me, but he had the most obvious withdrawal symptoms, like red blotchy skin, shaking hands and mood swings. He was actually a good teacher regardless of this, but now unfortunately he is now dead.

Overall house building in the UK is at its lowest ever recorded. Since Thatcher stopped council house building we have built roughly half what we did in the late 60s. The market has been an absolutely terrible way of getting new houses, and house builders have been actively land hoarding to keep the prices high in something they call ""margin over volume"". This housing shortage is made worse by higher immigration to London and family breakup.


Now you don't think this has much more to do with a lower birthrate coupled with the difficulty of building new homes given planning permission etc than ""The market has been an absolutely terrible way of getting new houses""?

For the biggest problem (international terrorism from Islamic extremists), killing the motive is the easiest.

Most of the time when military action is taken against terrorists, it's those from overseas which threaten us ^(because we threatened them since the cold war), I think they are of much more concern to those in power. The majority of ""[banned organisations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_in_the_united_kingdom#Banned_organisations)"" have Islamic Extremist ties, and are foreign-based. The rest are Irish. These groups are the reasons why the Government thinks they are right to invade on our freedoms, and why the public are totally apathetic to this happening. Environmental/political/nationalist groups are very rarely cited. 

TBH, Nationalist groups get along just fine without them using terrorism - instead, the fear of international terrorism are making more people agree with them willingly.

I think these domestic groups can be dealt with the same way we deal with organised gangs (which are a bigger problem IMO).

I do really feel for his wife, she stands by the fact she had no idea - and given it happened 10 years earlier, she probably didn't.

Tl;dr - Paedophiles and other inappropriate relationships.

* A 32-year old, 6th year student. Trying to get himself a good education, managed it for a long while too. Pulled the con off for about two year, one year at BA, the other at the University of Dundee while studying to be a doctor no less.

* Maths teacher was forced to leave the school and the profession after a former pupil's father - a notorious gangster/headcase - told him that he was going to cut off his head if he kept seeing his daughter. They hooked up on one of these ""go and help deprived kids in &lt;Asian country here&gt;"" trips after she had finished her sixth year. Shame because he was probably one of the best teachers ever to have graced that school. Ended up working in a pizza shop with the girl for a little bit after I left school.

* Another Maths teacher having an affair with a couple of under-aged pupils. Got away with it too until one of them mentioned it casually to some friends after she left for University. Another reasonably good teacher, but looking back on it now it doesn't surprise me an awful lot. Happened a couple of years after I left.

* The final one, which I just learned of, seems to be a paedophile from the Music department getting grabby with some of the young lads.

Nevermind, you said it was in 1997 in another thread.

300,000 images would be a huge stash at that time. You mentioned ""other devices"" but consumers only really had computers to store digital data on. Digital cameras certainly weren't widespread.

56 kbps modems didn't arrive until 1997 and internet connection (except say in a Uni) would most likely be pay per minute; a pretty high end computer would have a 3.2GB HDD.

300k images would have to be under 10KB each to be stored on such a drive. However at the time FAT16 was standard and that has a file limit of [65536](http://pc.wikia.com/wiki/FAT16) files per volume. With classic MBR you could have 4 partitions per drive though. Certainly a second drive would be needed, they were hundreds of pounds each.

Realistically that internet connection is likely to average 14.4 kbps which gives you 500 hours of downloading. In 1996 there were only ~100,000 websites in total (though newsgroups and other non-web forums [eg BBS] were in use).

Anyway, such a prolific store of images of abuse would be very big news, probably at the time the biggest cache ever found?

You can be even better than the Doctor. Take all the best things from the character, and add them to the good qualities you already have. Don't neglect your own personality. 

I did it when I was 12 years old. I decided to be like a fictional character that was very unlike me and inspired me greatly. I'm still grateful for that decision, because I developed character traits that I wouldn't acquire otherwise. And the process is very interesting. It really expands your personality. It also shows you where your own behavior is better than the character's - no one is without fault - so at the end you don't become exactly like him, just a bit more like him, in your own way.

Well, that's circumstantial. Winding people up can be pretty funny at times. If a mentally healthy adult can't take a bit of virtual verbal then I feel bad for them.

&gt; and I don't agree with Stephen Fry on that quote, I think there is very good reason for learning about the people we have interactions with, and learning how they feel in response to what we say ... if they are offended, it is useful to know that, especially if we want good relationships 


Without trying to sound callous, I don't really care about posters here on a personal level as I have previously mentioned. I'll PM a couple and chat here and there with some, exchange banter etc but for the most part I don't feel I form bonds with people who are just 1's and 0's.

Also since offence is a relative term, one can hardly be expected to constantly cater for everyone's needs. Yes I understand that by majority people usually have similar sensibilities and it'd be fairly easy to gauge what will or wont offend people.

However, I feel that whilst people are perfectly entitled to be offended by whatever they choose... Why should I care? I've recently been loving The Clash, you might not like them, what if I took offence to your music choice? How should you react? Write me a lengthy letter of apology? 

 &gt; and for all his brilliance, Stephen Fry is hardly an expert on the subject of good relationships

I don't know much of his personal life other than he experienced a lot of trouble in his youth and TWOC'd a car and committed card fraud at an early age and more recently suffers from depression.

To basically say here what I said there: I think that the nature of Doctor Who favors a point-and-click puzzle-adventure over anything else.

There are only two genres that work splendidly without combat and rooty-tooty gun shooting and lasers to inspire interest: Comedy and Survival Horror. Luckily, those are the two most common themes in Doctor Who.

Make a game that takes heavy inspiration from games like *Starship Titanic* and blend it with some classic survival horror elements. Make it a funny, evenly-paced, and clever puzzler that's able to bring the laughs and scares.

If we are going to compare the two show runners. RTD made the Doctor almost anonymous. He would slip in, save the world, then leave before tea (except maybe on Christmas Day).

Therefore, property owners have all the incentive to get you to leave so they tend to be complete dicks. Plus, they ask for ridiculous amounts of money on move-in since they know they can't raise rent if you stay there for a while. In addition, rents are *further* raised by the fact that people, when they buy, are unlikely to offer their home for rent since the amount they'd get from a long-term rental wouldn't cover the mortgage, leading to a housing shortage--coupled with the fact that people are very unlikely to move once they've locked a place down considering rents have increased ~100%-200% over the past year.

true,Halk,scot-lanarkshire,Lanarkshire,"There's a couple of big glaring things that struck me.

&gt;The average single person in their twenties will now have to save for over 14 years before they can buy a home, says the housing charity Shelter.

It's much more expensive to be single and buy a home, it's just the way it is. If we all tried to own individual homes the housing crisis would be incredible.

&gt;A young couple with children will need nearly 12 years to get enough money for a deposit.

Plan for it. If you're going to breed then wait until you're financially sorted for it, rather than dropping out kids and then holding your hand out for money.

As for people who want to take a reasonable, measured run at it..

You find a partner, you save together while living with your parents, and when you've saved enough you have your deposit. Assuming you both earn a very modest 16K a year and you need a 15K deposit then you should be able to save 5K a year each, so it's only 3 years saving.

If you can't make it because you're single then wait longer - I had to. If it's because you got yourself stupidly into debt for no real reason.. then pay it off first - I had to. And if you can't keep it in your pants then I'm afraid you're going to end up renting forever unless you have an enormous force of will.

The government is not helping at all though by ""helping"" first time buyers with overpriced brand new properties. All they needed to do was match deposits up to 10%, without restricting it to new builds, and the housing market would be fixed.",0,1371701550,null,0,false,0,camgshk,t3_1gnc8p,t1_camgshk,t3_1gnc8p,null,1430748345,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,ashmaht,tardis,TARDIS,"Honestly, I love him. He's like a more comprehensible Grant Morrison (who I also love). I like that things are more mythic in scope than they used to be. I love that 11 is more of a superhero-adventurer like Silver Age Superman. 

But his writing certainly isn't for everyone. It has plenty of faults. For example:

- all his female characters are written more or less the same way (headstrong and flirty)

- he loves throwing in big ""plot twists"" that really don't hold up to much scrutiny

- he enjoys the theme of ""love conquers all,"" which is a fine theme but he definitely overuses it

- he breaks the rules he establishes all the time -- generally speaking, he prefers what sounds ""cool"" or ""dramatic"" to what actually makes sense (the ending of The Angels Take Manhattan is blatantly nonsensical). 

- he sets up a lot of plot threads and I'm honestly not confident he's ever going to make them pay off (seriously, it's been two whole seasons since the TARDIS exploded and we have no idea who did it or why). 

So, while I certainly prefer him to Davies, I can definitely see why people might not like him. Personally, I think the good outweighs the bad. Moffat's dialogue is unparalleled. He can write the shit out of an epic monologue. And, if you don't overanalyze his plot threads, the show is more fun than it has ever been.

That said, I really hope his style changes up a bit for the next Doctor. That'd really break it for me.

I was in a house near Boston which a few friends and I had rented for a week or so. We were drinking significant amounts of tea (English Breakfast, if I recall correctly) in a reasonable approximation of the approved manner.

But one guy decided that he needed more caffeine per cup of tea. This may have been the guy who was bragging about the secret chemistry work he was doing for the government. (I don't know if that part was true, but I wouldn't be surprised.)

Anyway, his first attempt was to steep the tea in Mountain Dew. This is the part that the post reminded me of. It was pretty awful, of course. But his second attempt was much funnier.

This time, he put about five tea bags in his mug to steep at once. He had the idea that he could steep it for a shorter time and this would give him the caffeine of five cups with the flavor of one cup. I don't remember if it turned out that way, but he ended up tossing the tea bags into a cup that was in the sink and filled with greasy dishwater.

About three hours later the best part happened. Another of the guys in the house happened to walk into the kitchen and saw the cup in the sink.

There was always a story in our high school of a boy who was seduced/lured into the woodwork room in break time by two really good looking girls, he followed his dick as any teenager would do, they started undressing being playful, he undressed and... somehow... persuaded him to put his balls in a vice, the story goes they tightened it and his balls popped and he died of shock o_O

...

Little did he know the kid he was ridiculing had come over to the other room to ask the teacher for advice about a song or something and was standing right behind him as he was saying all this.

From what I remember the kid was mortified ran out of class/maybe school if I remember correctly, told his parents who got straight onto the school.

What I am down about is first that Liverpool let him leave on international duty without either addressing this issue with him before he went (there was a comment thread here where we *knew* something was going to happen), didn't send anybody with him and after the first interview have somehow allowed him to continue making these statements. 

Second is that Luis allowed himself to be tapped up in this way via the media. Notice that the actual rumors from the Real Madrid side of the story have stopped? There was only a single story about him from Marca and Luis took that and has now spent a month talking about how he wants to leave. Meanwhile all the rumors at Real Madrid are about Bale and Cavani .. a bit awkward for Suarez that the club he is professing his admiration and willingness to move to isn't really showing much interest in return.

I don't think Suarez will hand in a transfer request first because he would be punished on wages and payout and second because he wouldn't do that without an offer from Real Madrid and a contract already setup. Real Madrid aren't going to extend that offer because they aren't going to meet the £40M+ valuation for him. This was all about trying to force a cheap move - fair play to them. If we cave in in any way then we are mugs. Other players have been through a lot worse and recovered, I think Luis will as well.

I'm also not very comfotable about the amount of time remaining on his contract. Next summer he has two years left - that is the point where it is sell or re-sign.

What makes it quite funny (in a way) is that he was one of the most popular teachers at our school with the students.

The town centre museum has barely updated since the 80s - at least last time I went. It's vaguely alright. If you're bored you might want to have a peek (it's free I think - no way would anyone pay for it!)

There's some nice countryside around Northampton but probably not accessible by public transport. Abington Park is near the town centre and nice for a walk if the weather's fine. There's a museum there too, which I think it's a little better than the town centre one - but not by much if anything!

78 Derngate.. is a house I've never been in but apparently it's a tourist attraction due to having a semi-famous designer. 

There's a cinema (vue) and theatre (derngate &amp; royal) in the town centre - the theatre is pretty good, but obviously it depends what's on.

There are quite a few good restaurants; i can maybe recommend you a couple depending on what food you like.

Nightlife I'm not an expert on, but basically - Bridge Street is full of clubs with chavvy clientele - IMO avoid if possible. There are a couple of other OK clubs in town and some good pubs on Wellingborough Road (almost always referred to as Welly Road).

More than 9,000 mentally ill people a year are being detained in police custody despite official guidance that such powers should be used only in exceptional circumstances, watchdogs say.

The official investigation of the watchdogs finds that some of those being detained are as young as 14. The majority in a 70-strong sample said they were held after either attempting suicide or self-harm, or indicating that they were thinking of doing so.

The joint report by the police, prisons and health service inspectorates, published on Tuesday, says that police custody is regularly used to detain people whose only crime is that they are suffering from a mental disorder.

The report, entitled A Criminal Use of Police Cells?, says that ""place of safety"" powers, under section 136 of the 1984 Mental Health Act, make clear that people should be detained in a hospital or another health facility to be medically assessed and that police cells should be used only in exceptional circumstances.

The inspectors say that mentally ill people spend an average of 10 hours, 32 minutes in police custody, and that they are kept in the same type of cells and subjected to the same processes and procedures as people who have been arrested. ""The only difference is that they are ill, not suspected criminals,"" the inspectors say.

The report's publication follows the announcement last month by the home secretary, Theresa May, of a drive to end the use of police cells ""as places of safety"" for mentally ill people.

May has estimated that police officers spend 15% to 25% of their time dealing with people with mental health problems.

According to the inspectors' report, in many of the 70 cases examined in detail no reason was given why detainees were held in police cells. But the most common explanations were shortages of hospital staff or available beds, or that the person detained had drunk alcohol or was displaying violent behaviour, or had a history of doing so.

The report says that in 2011-12 more than 9,000 people were detained under section 136, and 16,035 were taken to hospital to await assessment.

In one case a custody sergeant told inspectors that he was so concerned about the welfare of a 17-year-old, detained overnight, he had put an officer outside his cell to monitor him. There had been no one from mental health services available to assess the teenager.

Kevin Huish, of the Police Federation, said that police officers did not wish to detain people under the Mental Health Act but were all too often forced to do so due to a lack of provision in other services.

""This is unacceptable for the officer, the individual and the public,"" Huish said. ""This is an issue which has been identified by the government as a serious problem … This matter needs to be addressed and it needs to be addressed urgently.""

A Home Office spokesman said: ""We are already working on a range of measures to ensure that people with mental health problems get the care they need.

""These include providing suitable places of safety in every local area and piloting street triage services where mental health nurses accompany police officers to incidents.""",0,1371713347,null,0,false,0,camjvwe,t3_1go123,t1_camjvwe,t1_cam7qnu,null,1430746886,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Loans are for players who haven't yet realised their potential to gain experience, but to me, whilst he clearly isn't yet the finished product, Wisdom still doesn't really need this sort of loan experience in the same way as (for example) Coates or Suso. He was used a decent amount last season in the first team as a cup player, and to a lesser extent as backup in the league. He performed very well for the most part, and for me he proved that he's capable enough to be considered a squad player. 

We've lost Carra this season, and it's possible we could lose Skrtel and Johnson too. If so then the hope is that these guys will be replaced with stronger players, but the fact is that even if we get some big name defender like Papa, they'll still be unproven and may require back-up now and then, especially given that we're much thinner defensively than we are in other positions. Considering that Wisdom seems to be developing very nicely anyway by just playing in our reserves, and the fact that he's a very useful player for rotational purposes, I don't really see the point in loaning him out.  I'd prefer to keep him in-house, playing in the reserves but rotating him into the less important or ""easier"" first-team games. I think he could make up to 20 appearances for the first team this season, particularly if we have a good cup run, and for me that's proof enough that he doesn't need further experience.",0,1371716235,null,0,false,0,camkdl3,t3_1gpqzk,t1_camkdl3,t1_camjysx,null,1430746655,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8

true,MrBushido2318,eu,European Union,"People are scared of GM crops because it sounds like the thing a mad scientist would do. But the truth of the matter is that we've been doing it for millennia, or at least taking the seeds of the best crops to make more of them.

Then a few hundred years ago we started selective breeding. Taking two crops/animals that had good traits and breeding them together. The resulting offspring would likely inherit the traits you were looking for and after a few generations of repeating this the chances are you had a crop that would always show those traits.

GM crops are just taking this one step further. Instead of relying on statistics and repetition to transfer desirable genes to your new crop, you use laboratory equipment to do it directly. The only real difference between the two is that now, instead of relying on sexual reproduction as a method to transfer genes you can now do it independently, allowing cross species breeding.

This is where people start getting ""ermagehrd glow in the dark frankenwheats"". But the truth is that is no more dangerous than selective breeding. Sure it's somewhat artificial, but it comes with huge breakthrough. Does crop x not grow in starving country Y because of high temperatures/bad soil/whatever? Simple, look at native crops, isolate the genes and adaptations that allow them grow under such conditions and then transfer them to a staple crop. Hay-presto 3rd world hunger solved.

But no, middle-class Caucasians with financial and/or religious goals scare 3rd world countries away from accepting gifts of these GM crops. They there's no profit from a self-sustainable country or think that dying of starvation is preferable to interfering with ""gods"" work. Well, seriously activists fuck you.

Well generally speaking GM crops are used in large scale monoculture farming which in itself is damaging to biodiversity. The main concern is that it increases the economic disincentive to not engaging in that kind of farming and to pursuing alternative farming models with less environmental impact.

&gt; At the moment countries that require emergency aid food hand outs are essentially facing this problem already.

When you get to this level its a question of the specifics of each locality's individual situation - the heavy lobbying to promote GMs however is based on a profit motive mostly not on a ""helping the poor people"" motive. Those specifics matter. If GM crops were unpatentable it would remove much of the opposition because research would be directed more by academia than industry and there is much more public trust for academia than for industry. It would also shift the incentives more to the public good and away from profit (although I am well aware that industry funds much of what academia does).",0,1371719698,null,0,false,0,camkw1u,t3_1gp1c2,t1_camkw1u,t1_camkud4,null,1430746401,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Too often they advise clients to go 'no comment' than own up or offer a mitigating defence that would clear them or facilitate a disposal at the cop shop. 
instead they end up throwing their hand in at court, wasting more tax payers money, getting people convicted @ court rather than cautioned or RJ'd but ensuring a few more coffers earned by lawyers.

true,AlanCrowe,null,null,"Bankers enjoy a special license to engage in business practices that would otherwise be unlawful. They borrow short and lend long.

Bankers accept deposits of cash on the basis that they are repayable on demand. Then the bankers lend the money out as term loans. For example a business is given money to build a new factory on the understanding that it will take two years to build and the bank cannot get any of its money back in under two years.

There is a kind of grand log rolling going on, with the bank keeping some money in reserve to repay depositors and depending on having lots of depositors, some withdrawing cash, others depositing more, so that there is enough cancelling and averaging to keep the bank solvent.

The contrast is that an ordinary business is supposed to have capital sufficient to cover the mismatch between the timing of its credits and debts. For example, if you are selling production for cash and buying inputs on one months credit, you need very little capital. But if production takes 3 months, you need to pay your creditors after one month, even though there are still two months to go before you get the cash in from selling your product. You are supposed to have the capital to do this.

An ordinary businessman is safe from jail it his product doesn't sell. (Though he has now lost his capital, having paid his suppliers, and since you are allowed to value a business as a going concern, when it fails it gets messy and he will not be the only one to lose money). But if he didn't have capital (i.e. he bought the stuff with no money and no plan to bridge the two month gap) then he was trading while solvent and at risk of criminal penalties.

Bankers are allowed to wing it. But with special rights come special responsibilities. At a minimum the bankers should at least understand the fancy financial derivatives that they use. It comes to court and a banker is asked: how was that supposed to work? If he doesn't know and can only answer that other bankers seemed to be making money, so he copied superficially without understanding, well, that was reckless.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Isn't large-scale monoculture farming is the normal practice anyway?

Depends where. In America massively so. Elsewhere it depends.

&gt;With GM plants you've got the ability to manage crop traits to a far greater extent, so I'd argue that it encourages biodiversity (in that it makes it easier to have multiple varieties of the same crop readily available).

Biodiversity is in this context talking about within an ecosystem rather than the diversity of domesticated crops available. 

&gt;whether or not monoculture farming is prevalent comes down to the individual farmers and how they operate their farms, not whether seeds are GM or not?

The question is which ""individual farmers"" are best placed to take advantage of GM. Under the current regulatory scheme GM advantages a particular model of farming that _as a totality_ has economic and environmental impacts that are _reasonable concerns_. It's a debatable point of course, some people say the best thing for everyone is to have a few big farming megacorps produce all the worlds food in massive monocultural industrial farms because it's more economical (which it is) and efficient (which it is). Other people disagree. Making it about ""olol scientific illiterates"" is a tactic in this debate to discredit an opposition without really considering all the issues at stake - of course it's unfortunate that many people in that opposition _are_ scientifically illiterate, but that doesn't discount the very real debate which was never about science so much as it was purely political (that is, about _values_ and priorities).",0,1371722686,null,0,1371722916,0,camla0w,t3_1gp1c2,t1_camla0w,t1_caml7zr,null,1430746218,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

&gt;3. Communications which may amount to a breach of a court order. This can include offences under the Contempt of Court Act 1981, section 5 of the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992, breaches of a restraining order or breaches of bail. Cases where there has been an offence alleged to have been committed under the Contempt of Court Act 1981 or section 5 of the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992 should be referred to the Attorney General and via the Principal Legal Advisor's team where necessary.

&gt; 4. Communications which do not fall into any of the categories above and fall to be considered separately (see below): i.e. those which may be considered grossly offensive, indecent, obscene or false. 

&gt;As a general approach, cases falling within paragraphs 12 (1), (2) or (3) should be prosecuted robustly where they satisfy the test set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors. On the other hand, cases which fall within paragraph 12(4) will be subject to a high threshold and in many cases a prosecution is unlikely to be in the public interest.

&gt;A prosecution is unlikely to be both necessary and proportionate where:

&gt;* The suspect has expressed genuine remorse;

&gt;* Swift and effective action has been taken by the suspect and/or others for example, service providers, to remove the communication in question or otherwise block access to it; 

&gt;* The communication was not intended for a wide audience, nor was that the obvious consequence of sending the communication; particularly where the intended audience did not include the victim or target of the communication in question; or

&gt;* The content of the communication did not obviously go beyond what could conceivably be tolerable or acceptable in an open and diverse society which upholds and respects freedom of expression.
