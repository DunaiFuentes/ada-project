Every time some nitwit answers a criticism of capitalism with ""But the USSR"" all they are doing is adding to the general ignorance quota. 

Maybe a good system hasn't been worked out yet. It has no bearing on whether or not capitalism is a miserable failure and a source of dreadful abuse and injustice. The rich enjoy a lifestyle built on the poor and disenfranchised. Capitalism is not even unambiguously better than the USSR. Plenty of people in Russia would prefer to live under a dictatorship that guaranteed a place to live and accessible healthcare than the post USSR capitalist society. Either way, why do you think that these are the choices?

I don't know whether to believe it or not since I haven't the capacity to verify if his pretty talk is true and if the data are interpreted correctly.

I am assuming you have no way to verify this either. So I am saying that you are accepting at face value the message of Mr Rosling's talk which seems to be - hey everything's OK actually, like a cult follower accepts the words of the leader. 

I don't know if what he says is right or not. I am merely suspicious of the universal adulation. The talk doesn't say anything about the end of fossil fuels and the inevitable rise in global average temperatures both of which will likely put the kybosh on any rises in living standards indicated by Magic Hans' Lovely Bubbles. 

&gt;You like 1950s lifestyle - fair enough. Oh wait - what got us that far? Democracy and capitalism dumb ass. We didn't invent capitalism in the 1970s - it's being delivering the goods in a modern sense since the industrial revolution.

What makes you think that a comfortable lifestyle couldn't have emerged from any other system. The only prerequisites were the inventiveness of the technologists and the availability of an abundant source of energy. The economic system that existed at the time was not the be all and end all. 

EDIT: Democracy is a meaningless term. How dare you call me naive?

If the bad shit is inherent to the system, yes you fucking do. 

&gt;(2) certainly we have used way more of the earths resources with our higher living standards and yes we should adjust and reverse that. Again you don't throw out the whole system to achieve that.

This can no longer be reversed. If you are brave, listen to the talk I linked to in the last comment. 

&gt;Um sorry you have got nothing but cries of denial and side shows instead of an actual argument for your 6th form politics student position, but it is not parrot like to challenge your naive bullshit with examples and research.

My personal opinion is that he has no reason to go anywhere at the moment. He is getting huge amounts of development, playing time and respect. He reportedly gets on with with his manager and fellow teammates, has a child and close family nearby. In my view, he would want a move *inside* the BPL, not outside of it, and I am unsure Levy would allow this. He also recently signed a contract extension (not that these mean that much for the right price) which is a good show of intent. If there is CL qualification, expect another extension with some more money. 

But that comparison to Suarez is apt - both a reasonably young players who have both stated a desire to play in the Champions League. Both have recently signed extensions.

true,cockpisspartridge,null,null,"&gt;Israel is not a communist state.

I didn't say it was. 

Quoth the original comment: ""Show me one country where communism has worked.""

In Israel, the Kibbutz is a communist idea that works. 

&gt;Capitalism and democracy work because they evolved slowly over centuries in order to create the system that you see here today. 

This is pure propaganda. Capitalism is the product of the European empires, it is a system of usurpation and abuse that corals wealth and, more importantly, power into the hands of a useless and selfish class of people. It has lead to massive erosion of the Earth's ability to sustain life and it only seems like a good deal to you because you are not one of the people working in a factory in China 14 hours a day to produce crap. 

I'm sure the class of high officials in the USSR thought everything was brilliant while enslaved peasants did all the shitty work. 

&gt;However, let me take some time to educate you: communism is an ineffective system by design

I'd be able to take you a little seriously perhaps, if you explained what you think communism is. You are banging on about it as if I am making the case for it where I have explicitly stated I don't know much about it. 

&gt;Now, let's say you've ""exported the revolution"" to enough places where you have the economies of scale to make a command economy truly feasible 

A command economy is not communism, I'm pretty sure. Why are you even talking about that? 

Capitalism is a command economy by subterfuge. I don't think any type of command economy would be beneficial. 

&gt;These are incongruent statements.

They are separate statements.

The poor of the 30s had barely anything to eat, the poor of today get obese. If the poor in the 30s caught a nasty disease then boo-hoo suck it up, you're losing a family member. If the poor of today get the equivalent they get world class healthcare free, no questions asked, with the exact same quality that the remaining well-off 90% of society get.

true,Lokiara,num42-away,,"My ideal summer would be signing an up and coming young striker plus one that's already established but just on the cusp of ""world class"" so they wouldn't be as expensive.

As far as up and coming go, there are two players who have been tearing up the Eredivisie that I think would be great: Alfred Finnbogason and Wilfried Bony. They've both been banging in goals, both are a decent size and strong, both are fast. However to me, I would prefer Finnbogason, as from what I've seen he looks like more of a complete forward and Bony looks like more of a poacher. Other options would be Aubameyang, who has been immense for Saint-Etienne, and Jackson Martinez who I wanted last summer (although I would prefer never having to deal with Porto again). 

Finding a more established player that isn't too expensive and would be a good fit is the harder part. I would take either of Soldado or Negredo, both of which I think could be possible. If the rumors about Higuain are true, that would obviously be first choice, although more expensive. Dzeko would be my dream signing, though I doubt City would even consider letting us have him, and it seems fairly tacked on he's going to BVB anyways. Beyond that I've really got nothing.

It creates the illusion of consensus building and public participation when we actually live in a system controlled by an unaccountable minority who don't have anyone's interests in mind but their own. 

No doubt true (to what extent we will probably disagree), but I believe that the tendency for an elite to emerge and influence things for their own ends is inherent in all systems, and is best counteracted by increasing public vigilance and involvement rather than calling for a wholesale replacement of the system. Sadly it seems to be a feature of our species.

&gt; What is it I appear to be advocating? 

I may well be doing you a disservice, but I understood you to be saying that everyone could be guaranteed a decent existence if we simply reached a consensus on what that decent existence entailed and decided to make it happen. My response (having pointed out the affordability issue) was simply that your proposal was essentially the underlying blueprint of modern politics with all the annoying wrinkles of differing ideologies and factions conveniently ironed out.

&gt; What do you think the world is really like? 

What I mean is the undeniable tendency for people to have different views, ambitions, interests etc and to form competing factions, parties etc and that these inevitably frustrate and complicate the straightforward aims you outlined. I also meant the tendency, referred to above, for any system to produce a power-seeking, power-holding elite.

true,Frankeh,eng-eastsusex,South East,"I'm going to throw some maths in your face to try and make you understand how foolish this idea of your is. 

Lets say you have a business and it has a turnover of £1m and a profit (before wages) of £234K.

You need 13 employees to run your business.

1 owner     
1 accountant            
1 store manager              
1 product sourcer            
1 customer service representative          
4 checkout staff    
4 shelf stackers       

Under your system where everyone gets the same the split would be:

1 owner = £18,000       
1 accountant  = £18,000             
1 store manager  = £18,000           
1 product sourcer  = £18,000           
1 customer service representative  = £18,000          
4 checkout staff  = £18,000       
4 shelf stackers  = £18,000    

Now the problem here is that the accountant is earning probably £6-8K less than he could basically anywhere else. The only qualified/experienced accountants you'll get for that money are the desperate ones and they'll be looking to leave asap since why would you work for less than you're worth unless you have to? 

The store manager. Again, he's £2-3K underpaid under your scheme. He's not going to be sticking around either if he knows he can get £21K at sainsburys. 

Customer service representative. She's getting about as much as is expected, but she's on the phone and dealing with pissed off customers all day getting a right earful of bollocks and generally getting shat on. She's now staring at contempt at the checkout staff who are getting the same amount of money as her but with half the stress, and she's really hating on the shelf stackers who have not even 1/8th of the stress she does, yet again they're paid the same as her. This will eventually see her leave the company. 

Checkout staff are happy enough. They're earning £2-3K more than they should be, but they're still jealous of the shelf stackers who don't even have to deal with customers at all but are still getting the same wage as them. 

The shelf stackers are just happy as fuck. They're being paid £6-7K more than they should be and have as near as matters zero responsibility. Shelf stackers (aka the lowest skilled work at your company) will be the only job title that doesn't have low employee retention. 


You know who gets screwed the most though? You. You do. You put all the loans to start the business in your name, you secured the building, you hired all the lawyers to get the contracts written up, you organised all the sign writers, you interviewed all the employees, you did all the market research, you put everything you own on the line to get this business going and worked 12 hour days for years yet you're earning as much as the school dropout that wandered in and asked if he can do the job where he puts the coffee beans where the coffee beans need to go. 

You make the wages more fair (or unfair, in your frankly idiotic opinion) and the business starts to make sense.

In one role I would be building something, in another I would be doing a task by rote. I require very little money to be happy. What I cannot abide is work that bores me to suicide.

true,Sparklesnap,flair4,,"The problem is that Parker *doesn't* hold possession well or see the attacking part of the game well anymore. He just *goes*. That was fine last year, when Modric or Rafa would pop up in front of him, but most of the time last year we played the ball out from defense either through the wings, or through long balls over the top to Adebayor, who would then distribute. Parker wasn't asked to be a major part of the transition from defense to attack, something AVB is asking him to do this year; and so far, it's just not working.

I like Parker, I genuinely do, but I think his limitations as a player get papered over because he tries so hard... but this year, his effort has (for whatever reason) dropped off, and those holes in his game are showing through. He *does* have a tendency to dribble into bad situations and give the ball away, especially when pressured. He goes into challenges that aren't good situations, and gives away a fair few free kicks; his needless challenge on Carroll in the West Ham game is a perfect example; he doesn't need to go in on the slide there, just step up and put your body in front of the shot.

Moreover, he gets unsettled very easily when he's pressured, and doesn't turn upfield well at all; I've made this joke before, but it's a point worth re-hashing; he's like a wind-up car; he just goes in the direction he's pointed and then crashes into things. The goal against Fulham was created this way; he got the ball going forward, ran forward with the ball, gave it away with an *awful* pass, then ran at the man he gave the ball away to, pulling the entire defense out of shape *70 yards from goal.* That forced Benny to step to the man with the ball, Dawes and Caulker to step up to runners from the midfield, and left Berba, who slowed up and drifted in last, one on one with Naughton, who can't be expected to handle a class striker like Berba in that situation.

All because Parker gave the ball away, then dove forward to try and get it back. And the worst part was watching him jog/walk back as the play progressed. Last year? Maybe Scotty gets back, tracks with a midfielder and helps out. This year? No chance.

Also, since this is already a wall of text, i'll throw this out there; How often do you see Scotty on the edge of the box when we're pressing for a goal? How often do you remember seeing Sandro actually making runs into the box? A *big* part of our problems against Liverpool, Fulham, and Inter were because we could not hold possession consistently and keep the pressure on. Lennon has something to do with that; we're lacking width, making our passes more predictable. But Parker is also being *extremely* undisciplined as our holding/defensive midfielder, and allowing teams to break against us far too often, simply because he's getting caught upfield and we're unable to collect the ball from clearances and restart the attack, because too often our defenders have no easy passes because Scotty's jogging back from the edge of the opponent's box, where Sandro would more likely be right there as the easy outlet.",0,1363841579,null,0,false,0,c8zlxzs,t3_1ajcfa,t1_c8zlxzs,t1_c8yd8tq,null,1431654336,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Democrats won the majority of votes for the presidency, the Senate, and the House.  They only failed to get control of the House because the republicans had control of so many state legislatures during the last census, and were able to horribly gerrymander during redistricting.  To give an example of how bad this was, the Democrats beat the Republicans in the total vote count for the House by 5 percentage points, but still have a significant minority.

The republicans are in deep electoral doo doo in the long term because their platform is gradually eroding as older people die off, and minorities make up a greater percentage of the populace.  This is somewhat overblown in the media, because people tend to become more conservative as the get older.  The trend is still there though, especially because young people show no sign of change on social issues like gay marriage - some 80% of people under 30 are in favor.  

People are becoming less religious, and more suspicious of big business and the wealthy elite because of the bad economy.  The republicans are identified as bible thumpers, greedy and old, as well as racist and sexist.  Until those things change, they will face a gradual downslide.

As we all know this means they aren't lending. This cut will give small businesses 8% higher net profits a year which will hopefully be reinvested in the business. Bob's business makes an extra 8% in a tax year. He then hires a graphic design firm to make a new website/marketing. They make 8% more so hire a new secretary to handle the increased business.

Part Four: Eight People Sipping Wine in Kettering

This episode explains how politicians on the left, in both Britain and America, turned to the techniques developed by business to read and fulfil the inner desires of the self.

Both New Labour, under **Tony Blair, and the Democrats, led by Bill Clinton, used the focus group, which had been invented by psychoanalysts, in order to regain power**. They set out to mould their policies to people's inner desires and feelings, just as capitalism had learnt to do with products.

Out of this grew a new culture of public relations and marketing in politics, business and journalism. One of its stars in Britain was Matthew Freud who followed in the footsteps of his relation, Edward Bernays, the inventor of public relations in the 1920s.

The politicians believed they were creating a new and better form of democracy, one that truly responded to the inner feelings of individual. But what they didn't realise was that the aim of those who had originally created these techniques had not been to liberate the people but to develop a new way of controlling them.

...and the development of the post ww2 state saw the introduction of socialist ideals, the establishment of the NHS and comprehensive school system for example; we moved from holy-socialism (lets remember the word catholic means 'universal, together, complete' as in John Dunns famous 'for whome the bell tolls' where we're reminded that what affects one person affects us all - could it be any more socialist?) through to monarchy-by-consent (a classic example of the monarchy being socialist in this period is Queen Victoria's husband creating Albertopolis [The Albert Hall and the Museums and Colleges which surround it] and hosting the World Faire, plus the many infrastructural projects) then we moved into a period of progressive socialism which saw the emergence of the modern world, and very directly the socialist institutions worked on forwarding the things which would set Britain in good stead to embrace the modern world; things like the [bbc micro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro) a learning based computer upon which many of my generation developed their love for computers and for learning in general.   
  
but alas by this point the people who'd been manipulating the system to enrich themselves without a care for anyone else had become so rich and so powerful they totally dominated politics, the media and just about anywhere else they wanted to dominate - they led us into illegitimate wars, crashed the economy and now demand we fix their mistakes and give them credit for everything that's ever been good in the world.

I say cut it to zero and it'll give us a good 5-10 years head start while every other developed nation plays catch up. 

The revenue from corporation tax is only something like £40bn out of £600bn in total tax revenue. I think that can certainly be made up for by companies generally being able to spend more and employ more. 

Plus I believe that corporation tax only really applies to small companies who can't afford to run a tax avoidance scheme and funnel money through an offshore company.

I meant my criticism as specific to this website--people love to go against the grain here--but the end result is the same if the tack they take is the ultra-mainstream view, sure. 
&gt;At least the weirdo conspiracy theories at least sound like they are outside of the narrow box of accepted discourse. 

Yeah, David Icke's crazy beliefs are seductive to many simply because he presents a unified theory of pretty much everything. Every facet of existence has a tidy explanation in his world view. The only trouble, of course, is that he had to use reptilians and the hollow earth to paper up the obvious holes that couldn't otherwise be explained. The fact that we are all actively being lied to, manipulated and coerced by a global system that emphatically does not have our best interests at heart is indisputable, however. It's just a shame many of the people who realise this go off the deep end in their attempts to incorporate this into their world view.

I myself have a pet theory about the way things are going. That the ""fuck you I've got mine"" culture as it presented in the documentary series _[The Century of the Self](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Century_of_the_Self)_ is being compounded and hastened by our own technological advancements. As our society becomes more insular and layers of abstraction are placed in front of actual human interaction (Facebook, website forums etc), we see a startling change in values and norms; characterised primarily by a loss of empathy and a false estimation of our own worth and intelligence. The values of greed and selfishness are rationalised as merely being logical. You'll often find the people espousing these ideas using evolutionary terms and ideas to justify this: letting the disadvantaged in society die is part of natural selection, or that patricarchal gender stereotypes are biological and innate.

What we're ending up with is a weird hybrid of backwards Victorian values of oldschool liberalism (where the very idea of helping those in need was considered detrimental to the character of those being helped) coupled with the modern loss of community. The Victorians may have been socially backwards but the idea of Empire was a useful social lubricant. It built all our roads and train networks because people genuinely saw the public good in these projects. But just yesterday I saw a chap on the worldnews subreddit saying that the solution to water utilities and power companies having regional monopolies is to dig up all the streets and put in more water, gas and electricity pipes/wires to give us greater choice. And I've seen others elsewhere argue that we should privatise the roads, and then if people don't like the charges on those roads, we can simply wait for another company to build an identical road adjacent to it! Or even that the solution to air pollution is to _privatise air_!  I mean, ideas like these are selfish to the point of comical idiocy. But they are pervasive to a certain type of person. And that extreme ideology is the logical conclusion of the way we're currently going.",0,1363860375,null,0,1363860935,0,c8zoxi3,t3_1ann0q,t1_c8zoxi3,t1_c8zh8xz,null,1435563946,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

That's not quite as simple as it should be, you have to plan a few days worth of food so that none of it goes to waste by going off, you have to plan every meal and buy exactly the right amount of ingredients and while shopping you have to make sure you only buy the very cheapest products that you can find.

Which of those things are difficult? To do that for the entire week takes less time and brainpower than it does to make those burgers of yours. I spend considerably *less* time actually shopping right now because I know what I need, and don't waste any time thinking, or planning in the supermarket

Aside from the ASDA part, which is a bit of an odd non-sequitur. This can all be done at a Sainsburys, or a Tesco. All of which *deliver* (as does ASDA, though I have never really shopped there). High protein, highly micronutrient dense, and as high calorie as you need (I am personally on around 3000 calories right now). I note you can get lean british mince at sainsburys for 1.50 for 250g there as well. 1.66 for 250g of Taste the Difference mince.

This isn't to live on noodles and carrots. This is chicken, oats, milks, eggs, lentils, sardines, tuna, high fibre bread. All INCREDIBLY healthy (especially lentils, my good are they good for you. Though they make me fart, so I don't eat them). Certainly at least as much as minced beef served in a bun. 

Edit: Again, just to emphasize there is nothing wrong with not being interested in planning meals in advance, or in having different desires for food (say, you like fajitas, or well treated animals).

As far as I'm aware, there is little proof that lower taxes means they're more likely to pay, only that they will move on to the next lowest available tax. If the Netherlands suddenly increased their tax, and Malta wiped theirs out - companies living on the benefit (Amazon, etc) all move to Malta. However, while this may make very good business sense, you're effectively using a countries good infrastructure for potentially less than it's real value. It may not create a net deficit, but it's still profits you wouldn't have if you didn't establish yourself in the country. Starbucks is a perfect example. They may be suffering, but they can still afford to pay tax on a vast amount of employees who are employed in 3-4 shops in small areas, effectively making independent coffee houses less profitable. Again, it makes perfect business sense, but it doesn't give the taxpayer any value for the money we spent out in infrastructure.

Downloading an album for free, it does not appear to be having an effect on the EU-wide sale of music products http://www.scribd.com/doc/131005609/JRC79605 (One of many studies) While I don't support piracy (I personally consider it theft, although it's technically not), it does not seem to be as damaging as the record companies are making out, that's because one download does not equal a lost sale. If you were never going to buy it because it's not worth your time paying for, you never would have bought it. Ever.

ISA's are an interesting factor, and one I can't comment too much on. But as I see it, there is no savings scheme currently available for the average consumer where you will not lose money. Any savings account below inflation (Which is, practically, all of them) loses you money that you could have spent now for it's real value. Again, I don't know much about it so I'll give you that point.

Classified ads and bootsales are something I really, really feel passionate about. In the age of digital products, you no longer own anything you buy. You are merely given permission to use it, and that permission can be removed when they see fit or if you breach conditions (Software, services, etc). When you buy a washing machine, you are effectively paying for somebodies labor, and all the tax that involves, as a one-off fee, and the item is officially yours. We should always have a right to re-sell any product we officially own, and not be forced to re-buy licenses for continued use. So no, bootsales and ads are NOT tax avoidance, but the very element of ethical trade.

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxford,"Interesting theory. I did economics for undergrad and didn't come across this.

It makes sense in some cases. For example, if you tax alcohol purchases in the UK too much, drinkers will buy direct from the EU and/or start bootlegging/smuggling/brewing it instead of buying it legally in the UK. Thus, revenue from alcohol tax will reduce.

However, I am not convinced of its validity for corporation tax.

Firstly, companies (except for very few exceptions of course) aren't doing anything illegal to avoid tax, they are using legal loopholes. Worst case scenario is that the government closes the loophole and they can't keep using it in the future. Thus, they aren't taking legal risks in doing it, unlike the alcohol tax example. If the tax rate is lowered, they still have no legal incentive to stop avoiding it.

The only plausible incentive for them to stop avoiding tax is the financial cost of tax avoidance, ie. the cost of hiring accountants and lawyers as you said. This is where I don't agree with the assumption that they would stop using these services if the tax rate is lowered.

If the companies have to pay *any* tax at all, they'll still use tax accountants to ""optimise"" their payouts as much as possible. They may use fewer accountant/lawyer hours but they'll still do it. As long as the savings from tax avoidance exceeds the cost, even by a little (and we can probably assume it does by *a lot* for most companies), it makes perfect business sense to reduce your tax liability!

I think that the simplest effect is the most likely effect: reduce corporation tax and you reduce tax income. Note that I'm not making any comment on how this would affect companies choosing to come to/leave the UK for tax reasons.

Nevertheless, if you have any data that shows an example of this ever happening (ie. reducing corporation tax rate increases tax income), I would be very receptive.",0,1363864829,null,0,1363865011,0,c8zpfdt,t3_1aof6d,t1_c8zpfdt,t1_c8zd3dr,null,1431656041,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,Anthzzz,null,null,"&gt;Wait - are you saying it is irrelevant or it isn't? It's relevant for pensioners on the state pension. Why isn't it relevant to immigrant families (I know you dispute defining them as this once they've been granted residency, but that's what they are).

I'm saying it is irrelevant for welfare because it is different to a pension as I explained.

&gt;Just to be clear, I don't oppose immigration. I oppose the level of assistance offered as soon as they've been granted residency/asylum.

Glad to hear but once they've been granted residency, they have the exact same assistance as any other. Like I said before, they are granted some financial aid while their application is being processed (as they are in a foreign country with nowhere to go) but it is minimal and less than that of job-seekers.

&gt;No offence, but it sounds like you actually have very little experience how the welfare/benefits system actually works. Anyone who has tried living independtly on a low income should know about HB eligiblity.

Just because I haven't claimed off the welfare system doesn't mean I don't know about it.

Seriously, get off reddit for a while because the Libertarian wankery is clearly starting to affect you. Ever heard of the bystander effect? People in large groups don't help others in need because they think someone else will. People walk past homeless men and women in their droves without blinking an eye. You really think they'll voluntarily donate if they don't pay tax? Not gonna happen.  Taxation means everyone chips in some amount that is ostensibly fair, and everyone can get the benefit of that when they need it. Without that, it would take altruists giving up every penny to cover the shortfall of regular people keeping everything for themselves - as they would be well within their rights to do.

Benefits are supposed to be a support to help people when they fall on hard times. Yes, some people abuse that. No, that doesn't mean they should be taken away, even from those abusing the system. What's the alternative? Let them starve? Take their kids away? No thank you. ""I'm alright Jack,"" is a horrible ethos to live by, especially in an entire nation.

personally known the applicant for more than two years. This is a useful anti-fraud measure which aims to ensure that 
countersignatories are persons who: 

* not only enjoy a good reputation in the community; 

* have credentials that can be checked; i.e. current British passport 

* would lose something by wrongly countersigning applications. 

**The criteria for a countersignature** 

A person deemed qualified to countersign a passport application may be either: 

* a Member of Parliament, Justice of the Peace, Minister of Religion, a professionally qualified person (e.g. doctor, engineer, 
lawyer, teacher), local councillor, bank officer, established civil servant, Police Officer; or, 
* a person of similar standing (see sections 3.1 and 3.2 below); and, 
* who has personally known the applicant for at least two years; and, 
* not a relative of the applicant (this includes partners, in-laws, and step-parents). Definition of ""partner"", if evident from the 
application form, is a partnership or relationship that is akin to marriage.
 
* The countersignatory must hold a current British, or Irish, passport. 

* Members of staff should not sign applications

Socialism is a very specific thing too. It means having the workers control the means of production, and it is the first step on the way to a full communist state. This subreddit is patently not socialist in that regard, because if you tried arguing that the people should take over every single private business in the country, you'd be downvoted into oblivion.

Now if we're going to have a serious discussion about it, I would say that the subreddit leans (and I mean leans, not lurches) left, but that doesn't make it socialist, or even social democratic. Opposing, say, workfare, is hardly leftwing. It's left-centre, and in a world in which the Labour Party can't even bring itself to vote against workfare, that makes the Labour Party pretty much centrist. Therefore, if this sub leans leftward of Labour, that does not make it leftwing.

I agree, there is less tolerance of rightwing ideology here, but that's because most rightists in the sub are pretty hardcore libertarians, as is the wont of Reddit in general.

Yes, the welfare state is a safety net, to cover ESSENTIAL NEEDS only. Last time I checked, alcohol, cigarettes, and indeed ANY TYPE of TV, flatscreen or not, are not *essential*. There's a reason they are considered *luxury* items and taxed appropriately.

How am I reaping the benefits? 

&gt;The current system is not free and not efficient

Sure it is. You could sell me your wrist watch right now and I could pay for it. There's nothing stopping that from happening. The market is free. 

You could set a price at £100 and I could refuse or accept that offer depending entirely of my opinion of its worth. That's efficiency in the system. 

You could offer your £5 casio watch to 1000 people for £100 and not get any takers. This would cause you to reduce your asking price because it's not what people are willing to pay for it. Efficiency in action. 

Same can be said with employees. Becoming an employee is just selling yourself. How much you're worth is completely up to the person you're doing the transaction with, the employer. 

Just like you can value your £5 casio watch at £100, you can value your time at £50,000 a year. But unless you're worth that to someone, you're not going to get it.

* River Song's first appearance got her ""saved"" in the Library's **mainframe** with CAL.
* Her next appearance was sparked by the Doctor finding a message engraved on a black box found in the Delirium Wing of a museum on a planet known as **the last resting place of the Headless Monks**.  I believe the post wrote it was the ""Dorium/Dorian"" Wing, though.
* The Headless Monks so far have only been seen in Demon's Run.  What did they do there?  Demanded ""volunteers"", gradually reducing the army count of the Silents.  Prevented Col. Run-away and his forces from immediately capturing the Doctor in the confusion after his reveal.  Their only major casualties caused were Dorian (who was strategically placed and preserved to give the Doctor advice later) and Stax who was already old for a Sontaren and later reconstituted anyways.  All and all did more help than harm to the Doctor except for aiding Melody's kidnapping, which needed to happen to avoid paradoxes.  They also worship the Papal **Mainframe**
* Oswin's first appearance was in an episode that introduced nanomachines that could transform people and demonstrating her l337 hacking skills.
* CAL used the phrase ""Aren't I a clever little girl?"".

Other things not stated in that post:

* CAL had access to at least some of the [Doctor's adventures](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2y5yFmHnjs).
* The Library and Asylum have some interesting similarities.  A girl trapped in a computer/body, invisible (mostly) omnipresent threat, references to the Doctor's data trail used against the villain (in different ways), and both times the data was technically in the control of the girl.
* CAL and River together, so some personality influence there, tails of the Doctor's for who knows how long, and knowledge of time travel should it fall into the Library's hands.  Said knowledge is of the Tardis and the wrist job of Time Agents.  Then there is the possibility of the Doctor still having Dalek nanites on him and she's using them to create copies wherever he goes.  This removes CAL independently having Time Travel and the Doctor spreading her by meeting the first Oswin in the future far enough where CAL could have had a body made already.
* The Doctor stated all of humanity became downloads for a time.  If the Library survived long enough till this stage, CAL could have gotten a body when humans returned to flesh.
* Smaller on the outside, sort of implies she's used to looking out from something rather than the outside in.  Doubly used to the inside being ""big"".
* First adventure, mind downloaded to a Dalek body (or just that transformed).  Second adventure, mind battled the Greater Intelligence. [Third adventure,](#s ""a wi-fi network wants to steal her mind."").  Three adventures dealing with her mind not fully being tied to her physical body.

true,kid_boogaloo,null,null,"&gt; He is making progress here with us. It may be taking time, but at least he's moving towards something while he waits. 

See, up until this season I would completely agree with you.  But I'm starting to think he's taken this club as far as he can. This season we had a superb squad, and while it's easy to be an armchair manager I think a lot of fans would agree he made some suspect decisions.  I also think his level of comfort here is not productive. 

If we had money to spend in January, which presumably we did given the bids we made, we should have fucking spent it.  

This was the perfect season to invest the fellaini money ahead of time and kick on.  That's of course not Moyes' fault, but to me it suggests that Kenwright isn't worried about him leaving. IMO Moyes should have walked into his office and said ""10 mil or I leave in the summer"" and put the onus on him.  

I don't mean to conflate two separate issues, but I think it's all symptomatic of the stagnation at the club,  of which I now feel Moyes has grown a part. It's just like Neville's comments about top 10 being a ""Massive Achievement.""  Impressive sure, exceeds expectations, yes, but champions league is a massive achievement.  Trophies are massive acheivements.  Just because we're treading water in the shallow end doesn't mean we're not still treading water.  

To be honest though, the Wigan loss is what really did it for me.  That level of play looked as though the manager had completely lost the locker room.  It's as though all the heart we show along the way disappears when it gets to certain stages, as soon as people start mentioning us and a final in the same sentence.  

So I guess the reasons for me wanting him to leave go beyond football in some ways. Sorry for the long, disorganized post but it's something I feel strongly about, though I'm not really sure how I feel.  The thought of not having Moyes terrifies me, but the thought of a manager who can inspire a team to play at their best even when the pressure's on and expectations are high, that really excites me.",0,1363874716,null,0,false,0,c8zr8jz,t3_1antu8,t1_c8zr8jz,t1_c8zq857,null,1431656894,1,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,1

&gt;Machines employ power to achieve desired forces and movement. A machine has a power source and actuators that generate forces and movement, and a system of mechanisms that shape the actuator input to achieve a specific application of output forces and movement. Modern machines often include computers and sensors that monitor performance and plan movement, and are called mechanical systems.

&gt;The meaning of the word ""machine"" is traced by the Oxford English Dictionary to an independently functioning structure and by Merriam-Webster Dictionary to something that has been constructed. This includes human design into the meaning of machine.

&gt;The adjective ""mechanical"" refers to skill in the practical application of an art or science, as well as relating to or caused by movement, physical forces, properties or agents such as is dealt with by mechanics. Similarly Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines ""mechanical"" as relating to machinery or tools.

&gt;Power flow through a machine provides a way to understand the performance of devices ranging from levers and gear trains to automobiles and robotic systems. The German mechanician Franz Reuleaux wrote ""a machine is a combination of resistant bodies so arranged that by their means the mechanical forces of nature can be compelled to do work accompanied by certain determinate motion."" Notice that forces and motion combine to define power.

&gt;More recently, Uicker et al. state that a machine is ""a device for applying power or changing its direction."" And McCarthy and Soh[6] describe a machine as a system that ""generally consists of a power source and a mechanism for the controlled use of this power.""

You'd have to go in for both, and I doubt Dortmund would be up for that—though giving them Dzeko might go some way to assuaging their concerns. It'd still be a lot of money though, and would probably rule out Cavani. Off loading Nasri with PSG or Monaco or someone could pay for Gotze, and giving Dortmund Dzeko might lighten the load for Reus. If we got rid of Tevez, too, we could probably still pay Cavani's wages, but I don't know if we'd be able to meet the transfer fee under FFP, as we aren't likely to get enough from an argentine club for Tevez to pay for Cavani.

The trouble is that none of the energy companies want to go first. The first commerical thorium reactor in the UK WILL have problems, it WILL be less efficient than it could be, and it WILL cost a lot of money (when compared with the next generation models).

If the cards don't fall perfectly for them, it could bankrupt whichever energy company invests.

They are doing the correct thing, waiting to see how things work out for India, let them make the mistakes, learn (steal), perfect and then build a commercially viable reactor in the UK.

It's especially important to get it correct now, many power plants in the UK are working long after their intended decommissioning date, better techniques and higher demand are forcing plants to work well after their designed retirement age.

It means that the life-time of a power plant has become a gigantic concern for power companies, building one that is sub-optimal just isn't worth it.

So based on the information you've provided, you don't qualify.  If I'm not mistaken your problem is simple, you've got a Gross income of £13k.
if you look on http://www.listentotaxman.com/ you can see what you tax you pay, its actually very little.

Don't worry about paying your student loan, you won't have too until your earning more money.

What you need to sort out is the lifestyle your expecting, living alone is really, really expensive.  It shocked me when I left uni, even thou I planned for it.

What I'd suggest is taking some time to budget.  Make an spreadsheet of your monthly outgoings, everything, you want to be able to buy a stick of gum, it goes on the spreadsheet.

When you do that you can really see where your money is going.

I think when you see the effect your accomodation has you might realise you need to be realistic in your expectations.  London is very expensive compared to manchester, a buddy of mine has a fairly central house share, £500 per month with everything, electricy, gas, water, council tax, sky, broadband, etc. included.

One of the best things you can do is keep 'fixed costs' down, that is anything you have to pay every month.

Really what you are asking here is what the agenda of energy and transport ministers is, and that I can't say.

One of the reasons that the French energy industry is so powerful (EDF is the French state-owned energy provider) is that the government itself took on the R&amp;D risks of developing viable Nuclear power. There is a famous quote attributed anonymously to the French  ""We have no coal, we have no oil, we have no gas, we have no choice.""

That won't happen in the UK, since all our energy industries are privatised, and we have an abundance of gas and oil (at least by comparison to the French). Nuclear power is also less popular here.

The only way I see us getting thorium plants is by offering enormous subsidies to state funded companies such as EDF to offset the risk of the R&amp;D. 

When I say enormous I mean seriously big, it has to be worth the plant's lifetime dent to profits that design hiccups and inefficiencies will cost.

Even then it will probably take decades because of the inherent risk I mentioned in my previous post.

More likely I see us waiting until Europe has a few perfected reactors and a French or German backed company sees an opportunity to build in the UK (which the government will no doubt welcome).

I don't think that prison is too effective a deterrence, given how overcrowded they are. But you could point out that if there were no prisons, crime might be higher. I don't know what I'd say to that.

I don't think there's any need to put somebody in prison if they aren't dangerous, as removing somebody from normal society is going to make it harder for them to get back into normal society once their sentence is up. I think it's important to remember the distinction between justice and vengeance.

As I see it, justice is about accepting the truth of what has happened and trying to make it better, and trying to reduce the risk of it happening again. Vengeance is about making the victim(s)/onlookers feel better by quenching their (natural) thirst for blood.

Unless it's a life sentence, i.e those who are seen to not be able to be rehabilitated, then it's just about keeping somebody dangerous away from the public. But that's no excuse not to treat them like human beings. I know I would never accept the death penalty as justice.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"&gt;Fox Soccer took what was an unknown game in the states and has done their part to make it mainstream.
 
I'm not going to give FSC credit for doing what some other channel would have done anyway. Characterizing soccer as an unknown game in this country is absolutely ridiculous. It is and has been the most popular sport worldwide for probably a fucking century and though we haven't adopted it to the same degree as...anywhere else...the market has been here for a while. It wasn't some bold risk by FOX. 

And really, let's talk about the quantity of their coverage. Each week if you have basic FSC and no Plus, you're getting one game in each time slot and that's it. Usually 3-5 live games per weekend. The only exception is Champions League play where they put a second game on FSN and the final week of the Premier League season where they put games on their family of networks.

For a network whose ostensible achievement is bringing soccer to the masses in this country, the amount of live football actually on the channel is laughable. If you want to stream games from Fox soccer you have to pay extra. If you want another channel to watch soccer, you have to pay extra. 

NBC is going to be showing 6 live matches every week on its family of networks and it will stream the non-televised games on its website for no additional cost. Chances are high that you will be able to watch Spurs by legal means a lot easier and more frequently than with FOX having the rights.

&gt;I think the commentators are there to make the games fun. Everyone dissects EVERY FUCKING WORD they say without realizing that guess what...they're fans of the game too!

Studio analysts can certainly bring some levity to a broadcast, but their primary job is to be professional and provide some sort of insight that maybe your average viewer would find useful. For my money they do neither. I'll give them a pass on lacking good analysis because that seems to be the norm in Europe as well, but the mindless slagging of any team that isn't United and the constant gagging on American dong gets old very fast. 

It's like they read some British tabloid for their analysis and try to sensationalize everything as much as humanly possible. It's contrived and cringe-worthy. I actually felt bad for Arsenal after we beat them because of just how pathetic the studio analysis was afterwards--even without Piers Morgan.

I won't even talk about the cheesy bombastic production values trying to emulate the NFL but I could write a fucking essay on that nonsense. 

&gt;Maybe I'm a bit biased from meeting Wynalda personally and seeing his passion for the game.

If being passionate about soccer was all it took to be qualified for studio analysis, anyone on this subreddit could be making 7 figures doing it. Wynalda may indeed be passionate about the game but he's unprofessional, agenda-driven, bitter, and completely clueless. The man went on a Twitter rant and called our manager a coward after AVB dropped Friedel for one of the best goalkeepers in world football. When people called him out on this, he proceeded to make fun of their profile pictures or patronize them about what they do with their lives. Friedel himself basically had to distance himself from it. 

Every anecdote I read about Wynalda seems to be that he's arrogant and petty. Most of the people on /r/mls don't even like him. You might be the first person I've encountered on Reddit who does, actually. Maybe he's an okay guy, but he doesn't come off that way. I'd be surprised if he's still doing analysis once NBC takes over. 

&gt;I think a lot of the hate is 'being a soccer hipster' and I think we need to move past it.

To be honest I'm very sick of this argument. You can't look at soccer in this country critically anymore without being called a Eurosnob (because let's face it, 'soccer hipster' is just a euphemism for that). It's a convenient one-size-fits-all argument and it galvanizes people against something. 

Sorry, I just think we can (and will) do better with our coverage in this country. I'm glad FSC is around because I like watching soccer, but I can all but guarantee you NBC will do a better job in every way. They already have better presenters in Arlo White and Kyle Martino, so hopefully they add to them with similar quality.

It's easy to see in our (and many countries') justice why there's a perception that the victims of crime get shit on twice. First by the criminal and then again because no matter what the punishment is, the criminal will never have to go through what the victim has. 

Look at the Brevik example. He killed 70+ people. And he is living a life of relative peace and luxury now. He personally chose to violate 70 people's right to life, the most basic human right. Yet he is now being afforded all his human rights at the taxpayers expense. Is that fair? No, not at all. It's disgustingly unfair. Even you must admit that. 

However as you've said, it's the right way to do things. 

Rehabilitation is better for society in the long run. If it works it prevents that person committing crime again and it's cheaper for the taxpayer because they're in prison for less time and hopefully won't be coming back. 

But it's very easy to see why the relatives of a murder victim feel robbed when the murderer is released after 15 years in prison. I can fully empathise with people who think our justice system is too soft. 

I feel I'm rambling so I'll sum it up. I think too many people confuse justice with fairness. And it isnt, justice isn't fair at all. It's about what's best for society as a whole  not for the victim. From an emotional point of view I would love to see executions for murderers and rapists.

It resulted in hate mail and death threats towards Lucy Meadows. I can't even begin to think about the suffering she must have gone through.

**edit:** I feel like I should note that the article was deleted, but not before it gathered a couple hundred (awful) comments. It still appeared in the printed newspaper.

**second edit:** The Daily Mail have printed an obit piece for Lucy, [misgendering her throughout](https://twitter.com/stavvers/status/314912366682832896/photo/1). Fucking shameful.

**further edit:** [Here](http://www.newstatesman.com/media/2013/03/press-regulation-freedom-speech-and-death-lucy-meadows) is an article in the New Statesman describing emails Lucy sent to another member of the trans community in January regarding her struggles after the DM piece. I think everyone should read this.

&gt;Last night, I was given access to emails from Lucy Meadows to a member of the trans community, seeking help back in January. I spoke to others before deciding to write about them: we do not know absolutely if Lucy would have wished them made public – but this is now the only voice left to her.
&gt;
&gt;She talks of her good luck in having a supportive head. But the stress of her situation is also visible. She complains bitterly of how she must leave her house by the back door, and arrive at school very early, or very late, in order to avoid the press pack.
&gt;
&gt;She talks of the press offering other parents money for a picture of her; of how in the end they simply lifted an old picture from the Facebook pages of her brother and sister without permission. A Year 5 drawing removed from the school website was simply recovered through the magic of caching.
&gt;
&gt;Yet this is all about “how”. The big question is “why”: ah, yes – parental “fury” at her gender transition while a teacher. That might be an issue, if it was spontaneous and widespread. Only, Lucy writes of how parents themselves complained that their attempts to provide positive comments about her were rebuffed. The press gang, it seems, were only interested in one story: the outrage, the view from the bigots.

&gt;Alex Salmond has said that an independent Scotland would keep the pound. Much of Scotland's trade is with England. So it would still be highly dependent on the rump of the UK in important economic matters over which it has no influence

Learning times tables is pretty useless unless you understand how you're arriving at the answer - in which case you're not memorising.

As for the other topics, I'm curious.  Is there an intent to teach *how* multiplication and division of fractions works?  Or just the ""black box"" method that helps no-one when it comes to further learning.

Also...geometry.  Such a broad topic that could mean almost anything.  What are we teaching here?  How to measure shapes, find their areas, that sort of thing, again with the ""turn the handle"" methods.  Or something more abstract, like the concept of Euclidean geometry etc?

I would hope that the concentration would be on the _why_ these things work, but sadly I expect it to be ""this is the method now apply it 25 times"".

Utter nonsense, Scotland's entry into the EU would be the smoothest ever. Yes, there will be negotiations for terms but *we already meet all of the EUs criteria*. Scot's Law already codifies EVERY EU requirement. 

Besides, UKIP and many of the Tories are trying to take us out of the EU. This argument is a farce but it's not helped by the likes of the BBC who have [been caught lying](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/9914430/SNP-anger-at-enemies-in-the-BBC-boils-over.html) about this no less than three times recently. 

Scotland's entry into the EU is nothing but a formality. This argument has zero merit. 

&gt; So it would still be highly dependent on the rump of the UK in important economic matters over which it has no influence

And how does that change anything? We already have no influence. 

&gt; be saddled with a sizeable portion of the UK's immense national debt

A disgraceful lie. We will also be saddled with a ""sizeable"" portion of the UK immense national assets. We paid for them, if we are taking our share of the debt we are certainly going to be taking our share of the assets. 


&gt; Either way, Greek-style austerity would follow, the difference being that Germany would not bail them out

What in the holy fuck? What resources does Greece have? Nothing beyond tourism. Not only do we have tourism (way more than Greece I'd bet), we have national resources coming out of our arses. Tonnes of arbile farmland, all of the renuable energy you can shake a stick at. IIRC we has as much wave potentional as many other much larger nations combined.  A massively growing whisky industry (thank you up-and-coming China). Then there is all of the high-tech engineers as well as Scotland disproportionately massive banking and IT industries. Edinburgh is the fourth largest financial market city in Europe. 

&gt; the oil is not going to last forever

&gt;Rather than being purely a matter of law, the mechanism for an independent Scottish state to become a member of the EU would depend on the outcome of negotiations and on the attitude of other EU institutions and Member States. It is likely to be a process requiring unanimity across all Member States of the EU. Since an independent Scotland would be a new state there is a strong case that it would have to go through some form of accession process to become a member of the EU. This is the view expressed by the President of the European Commission.

The alternative to leaving the EU would be to remain part of the UK while conducting this process -- but whether that would be politically tenable, or whether the rest of the UK would stand for it, after a 'Yes' vote is unlikely. The issue would create immense uncertainty, discouraging inward investment in Scotland.

Given that we have the internets, that we've seen how many other contries simply ignore our superinjunctions, we can't realistically censor free speach, even if people wanted too.

I know I will get downvoted for that last sentence, but hear me out. The main problem with all of them playing in that 4-2-3-1 position is that they are all players that typically play in that ""10"" role for their respective nations and previous clubs. Oscar has been growing into that role for Brazil for the past year or so, and Hazard wears the ""10"" for Belgium as he did for Lille. While I think that Hazard has both the speed, touch, and strength to play out there, Oscar lacks the speed and strength, which is partially why he is better suited for that spot behind the striker. However, with the addition of Neymar, who primarily plays on the left wing for Santos, you can put him, Mata, and Hazard on the right. Oscar should be starting on the days that Mata needs rest in the ""10"" position and typically being the first person off the bench if we need to produce offense (I predict next season he is going to get stronger and be a much more influential player in the Prem).

&gt;They are de facto bankrupt, and if it weren't for the largesse of the public they wouldn't be collecting a pay packet at all.

Hardly largesse, the state did it for perfectly self-interested reasons, don't pretend we were being charitable.

&gt;As Nassim Taleb said in his AMA yesterday, bailed out bankers should not be paid anything over wages of civil servants. 

If we bail out banks to the point where we have a controlling share in them then sure, the state could choose to do that and I'd have no argument against it.

true,teafaceisming,eu,Derby,"In my mind this is incitement to hatred. The publisher, even if not attempting to or meaning from a personal standpoint to put a persons dignity at risk, is through negligence allowing such hatred to take place. He knew that the readership base would react in a hateful way, perhaps not extremely but it was inevitable. It is preaching to an environment of hatred, Cohen Almagor used the analogy of it being like throwing a still lit cigarette into a field of dry grass as opposed to a bin. Not only that but for a purposive reason, profit. This person has commited suicide and that is the concrete fact of the matter. The Daily Mail through add revenue and paper sales is also responsible as the publisher not to allow such material to be published. 

The argument against this line is that it won't allow a liberal market of ideas to exist. That if we regulate press in this manner it will chill speech. However, targeting individuals for banal reasons, race, gender, religion etc. have nothing to add and thus only exist in conflict with positive idea formation. This is drawing the line. ([See Richard Moon, he weighs both sides of the argument well in this paper.](http://law.fsu.edu/journals/lawreview/downloads/361/moon.pdf), [Schaur distinguishes between established free speech laws](http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.com/pdf/13/9780199225811.pdf))

The US, having the 1st amendment, is more absolutely opposed to regulating speech to any further degree but even they have some cases where things go too far. Look up the Nurembourg Files and Rice v. Paladin. The person below stated he was from Florida so unfortunately he is probably more protected over there. Although I am not advocating any serious punishment but doing nothing condones the actions of these individuals and signifies that our society is ok with inciting hatred against minorities.

Whilst this isn't strictly untrue of course(!), it was the Athenians of Ancient Greece that recognised the emancipatory, and democratic qualities of being clearly understood. Just because an individual can 'talk the talk', it does not make them right. However, those that cannot are not necessarily *wrong*, either.

Rhetoric still has its place in secondary education, but it is limited to the debating societies of public schools. There is a clear divide here between those who have a political 'voice' and those that do not. It is here that this aspect of the study of Politics has its own practical application.

I'm just particularly irked by his misuse of ""argumentum ad hominem"". *Everybody* (note: not actually everybody, I would like to make it clear that I am exaggerating for emphasis before I get cherry picked for being wrong) seems to be under the assumption the an *ad hom* is analogous to ""throwing an insult"". It's not. It's an attempt to steer the argument towards the character of the arguer, rather than the argument.

To give a pertinent example:

""You are a cunt. You are wrong"" is ***not*** an *argumentum ad hominem*. It's merely one statement following another.

""You are a cunt therefore you are wrong"" *is* an *argumentum ad hominem* because the case is being made that wrongness is brought about due to the character of the arguer.

I'm still terribly inept in matters of legislation as I've managed to avoid it over pursuing the political theory side of things in my studies; sure it's definitely useful, but for me politics is about debate. I'd remember if we had been taught about the pros and cons of taxation and we were given space to argue each side. I guess some of this is down to what particular school you go to and individual teaching staff. (not mine!)

As an aside, I'd definitely recommend some of the chaps named above if you ever consider pursuing the political philosophy side of things. Not too old as to be abstract and not *too* introspective to be readable. I'm looking at *you*, Derrida.

If you cut out having to worry about public opinion we'd have the country back on track in no time at all. It's all this pandering and u-turning that's resulting in fuck all getting done. 


If I became the dictator of the UK tomorrow I'd:

* Remove corporation tax entirely which would attract business and give the small businesses who can't afford to avoid it a break and a chance to reinvest their savings.

* Well since I'm the dictator there's not much more of a use for them. I'd drop their pay by half and remove all their benefits. They could report back to me with problems their constituents have and I would address them based on importance and impact. Also on how likely they'll get really pissed and start revolting. 

* Invest a lot in infrastructure. New roads to be built, new high speed rail lines from the bottom of the UK to the top. Probably need to do quite a few compulsory land buys which would get people pissed off so in the year when the sales happen I would..

* Give a £250 tax rebate to everyone who's ever paid tax amounting to more than £250. That should keep them happy. 

* For the NHS I would likely sell off all our hospitals to the private sector on 50 year contracts, after which the hospitals revert back to being state owned. The deal is that they get the budget that the hospital had the day before the sale (already inflated because of public sector inefficiency) and it rises along with inflation each year. All they have to do is run it, deliver the same quality care which is completely free at point of service. That's all I ask, that our NHS spending doesn't increase in real terms. 

* For education I'd introduce a graduate tax of 6% (when earning over 23,500) and *mostly* do away with tuition fees. Tuition fees would still exist for degrees that aren't in demand, but would be completely abolished for degrees in high demand. Which degrees cost and which don't would change year by year depending on what's happening with the country. Maybe attach a compulsory questionnaire to the back of business tax forms asking 'If you were to hire a new member of staff, what qualifications would you look for?'

* I'd keep the military budget about the same, but I'd rocket us into the future. I'd just buy the one aircraft carrier that's already half built, then I'd put a contract out for 2 or 3 smaller tonnage aircraft carriers and some fighter drones to fill it with (Something like the BAE Taranis). That's the future. We might as well get there first so we can sell some to other countries and make some bank.

BLOG - Why pay more for new nuclear?

 
Ian Marchant

Chief Executive

Negotiations between EdF, the state-owned French energy company, and the Government over the proposed new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset are at a crucial stage.

The sticking point appears to be the “strike price” — what we will all end up paying for power from the new reactor. If it is set too high or the contract is too long, consumers will foot an unnecessarily expensive bill for decades to come.

It is rumoured that £96-97 per megawatt-hour (MWh) has been agreed. But is that fair? Clearly it is a premium to current power prices, which struggle to get over £60/MWh. So why should consumers pay it?

One answer trotted out will be that the power will be “low carbon”, but onshore wind already costs less than this (about £90/MWh) and that industry is striving to get costs down even more. So that can’t be it.

Second, it is argued that the UK must lead a nuclear renaissance. But the technology we are buying, the European Pressurised Reactor (EPR), is a 1960s retread. Genuinely new nuclear options are being worked on around the world, but that isn’t what the UK is investing in.

Third, supporters of the deal claim that it will stimulate the UK supply chain. The only problem is that we are buying French technology from a French provider and French developer. So that’s not it, either.

Fourth, people say that nuclear will ease concerns over security of supply. But those concerns are about the next five years and no one expects a new nuclear station to be available before 2020.

Finally, some might argue that, as an established technology, nuclear power is predictable and robust. But experience of the only two EPRs being built in Europe, at Flamanville, in France, and Olkiluoto, in Finland, suggests exactly the opposite. Both are very late and very over budget.

So why are we doing it? I really am at a loss to answer.

We all agree that the UK must attract investment in a mixture of energy sources to keep the lights on and meet legally binding carbon-reduction targets. But affordability is just as important. Public subsidy should be targeted at technologies that will become cost-competitive in the long run.

A few years ago EdF proudly said that it didn’t need a subsidy to build nuclear. If that is no longer true, I struggle to see why we should all pay a premium over the other options. I see no reason why a combination of new gas, renewables and energy efficiency cannot bridge the energy gap for the next five to ten years while we let the nuclear industry get its costs down and improve its track record on delivery.",0,1363897211,null,0,false,0,c8zz64v,t3_1aq8d6,t1_c8zz64v,t3_1aq8d6,null,1431660693,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

They are criminals, fraudsters and failed miserably to manage risk, which is one of their primary remits, so they're incompetent too. We will be paying for their mistakes for the rest of our working lives. 

&gt;So you want to cap only those banks which were bailed out? 

Here's the thing: ALL banks are being propped up through a mixture of ultra-loose monetary policy, quantitative easing and the suspension of normal accounting rules. Remove these props and there would be another global financial crisis. So they all benefiting from implicit taxpayer support, whether directly bailed out or not. 

&gt;you're being hugely authoritarian

Remuneration policy was absolutely a key factor in causing the current crisis. It encouraged excessive risk taking and outright illegal behavior. Most people don't realize what a massive slice of earnings banks pay straight out to their staff in salaries and bonuses. This is typically 50-60% but has been even higher post-crisis when profits plummeted but bankers still expected six and seven figure bonuses. That's  *insane*, and completely unsustainable. No wonder they were run into the ground. Moreover, that money could have been used to build up a buffer to cushion against exogenous shocks, which would have lessened the impact of the crisis (they have subsequently be forced to increase their capital buffers).

So, as insolvent businesses operating in a taxpayer-supported policy bubble, if they are unable to set a sensible remuneration policy themselves, then one must be imposed on them.

I did not study politics at GCSE, and from everyone I've heard from; politics is not available at a GCSE level!

A level politics has utterly consumed my life. When joining the 6th form, I was dead set on becoming an English teacher, little did I know the world of politics was far more interesting.

I'd like to do a join honours degree of Philosophy and Politics.

My political views have most definitely been challenged. I considered myself a pseudo-conservative; feeling more empathetic towards figures like Thatcher for the hard work they did to get where they are. 

However, I'm a liberal at heart, and a complete leftist now too!

I have no party allegiance however, I'm under the impression that an oxbridge-dominated government is not a socially representative one.

Thanks for asking!

* Parents have a role to play in the upbringing of their children (although it does suck for kids with thick or disinterested parents)

* People are responsible for themselves and may have to educate themselves

This photo was taken just after the completion of the first Dalek story, 'The Daleks'. The the four props created for the story were no longer needed, the Daleks weren't initially ever supposed to return. So then producer Verity Lambert instructed two props to be retained in storage (just in case) and the other two were donated to the Dr Barnardo's Home at Stepney Causeway. This was covered in a Blue Peter feature on 10th February 1964, a week and a half after the story's final episode had been transmitted.

When a 'new' Dalek story was decided upon, Verity Lambert asked for the props to be lent back. The BBC got them back, as you can imagine, they were badly damaged! So they were fixed up and used in the 'Dalek Invasion of Earth' - afterwards two Dalek props were given back - however, the head/middle/skirt sections got muddled up and Dr Barnardo's ended up getting back completely different Daleks!

TL/DR: This photo was taken after 'The Daleks' but before 'The Dalek Invasion of Earth' while two of the props were given to Dr Barnardo's.

&gt; Main life support's down on account of the engine being dead. - Kaylee

&gt; But we've got auxiliary life support. - Mal

&gt; No we don't.  Ain't even on.  Explosion must have knocked it out. - Kaylee

later

&gt; Catalyzer is broke, gonna need a new one. - Kaylee

&gt; There is no new one you gotta make do with what you got. - Mal

Then they discuss that if they can't get the engine turning, they can't get life support back on.  No further mention has been made or will be made of the *auxiliary* life support.  It's like they didn't even try to see about fixing it.

And Kaylee did bypass the port compression coil in ""The Train Job"" which Mal told her to clean up because it looked like some terrifying space monkeys had been loose in the engine room.

So to recap:

1. The catalyzer on the port compression coil blew.  Kaylee had bypassed the compression coil but had had to undo it because it made the engine room a mess.  No mention is made of trying to bypass it again (bypassing the compression coil would bypass the catalyzer that blew on it).
2. The auxiliary life support which would have bought them more time on *Serenity* got knocked out but no investigation or triaging was done to see if that could be fixed.

As far as I'm aware, most exam boards don't even have a GCSE politics course to offer. I just had a quick look and apparently here in Wales the WJEC *does* do a ""Government and Politics"" course. Having said that; this is the first I've heard of it and we weren't offered it at GCSE.

I think politics is much more widely available at A Level. Again, despite this I haven't been given the opportunity to take it (and I go to a fairly large school).

Politics in some form should *definitely* be compulsory in secondary school. I say this because there are far too many people my age who know nothing about how our government works or who's even in power.

As a follow up: I actually think this is a good argument for lowering the voting age to 16.

Not really sure if the Elms student village is already booked up yet or not, but it would definitely be a good shout because all the rooms there are self-catering - living room, kitchen and all the mod cons you need.

King's Hall were the main venue is, isn't too far from Belfast's main student area in South Belfast and during the Summer there are usually more vacant rented accommodation as students tend to go back to their hometowns during the Summer.

No they don't. You do.

Kids don't know societies 'taboos' until adults teach them. There was an article a few years ago about a very young kid who wanted to go to his schools fancy dress as Daphne from Scooby Doo, and when his mum dressed him as Daphne, other parents complained. The mother and kid ended up giving a talk at an equality conference of some sort, and a cross-dressing male in a dress, holding a balloon wandered up to the kid, and said he was brave to be there because he had trouble with people for wearing what he wanted too. The kid simply smiled and said ""That's a nice balloon"". 

You see, kids don't have any prejudices until people like you and Littlejohn install them in to them. The kid didn’t give a damn that a man standing in front of him was wearing a dress, he just wanted the balloon he was holding.

Children struggle with it? NO. You do, and don’t be so cowardly as to hide your bigotry behind children too young to contradict you.

Nobody actually cared about who transferred the call of the radio 'prank', but the media made a big deal out of it implying that the call was the cause of her suicide *afterwards*. The nurse was not the target of the media, she was not singled out once (if you can correct me on that, please do); nobody was blaming her and she only mattered after she took her own life; nor, even if they were mocking her, were they about her life choices.

The DM article is directly talking about the teacher in a way that makes fun directly out of her life choices; it reads like a Charlie Brooker review about Lara Croft, except it's not fictional, it's about a real human being  -

I'm not saying that the DM was the sole cause, because she obviously had other issues that lead her to suicide - as everybody who ultimately commits suicide does - but you can be one hundred percent certain the the DM, the comments and the attention that the media gave her certainly played a role.

**Practicalities:**  How do you stop twitter?  Plenty of users have hundreds of thousands of followers, is that not a news source?  Almost every journalist tweets it appears.  We've seen people naming rape victims, or even suggesting that a certain former cabinet member was a pedo.  But then what about blogs?  Should the IWF not stop at just child porn?  Then what about TOR?

All they can do is regulate old fashioned printed news, the sales of which are declining rapidly http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_newspapers_in_the_United_Kingdom_by_circulation

To have these rules which apply only to the older, decaying media just appears pointless.

**Censorship:**  We've seen, just a few days ago, the extent to which a former government went to provide information which helped people be convinced with going to war.  It is not un-reasonable to fear any kind of government interference with press, there are many global precedents that show just how slippery the slope is.  I can't help but finish the last quotation, *Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.*.  Private eye has done an excellent job covering the dangerous side effects of some of the proposals.

**What I want:** Libel/Slander.  At the moment our laws are complex, only help the very rich and allow terrible global exploitation (See how scientology for example use our courts, they appear adept at it).  What we should have is a system were by people can get a kind of legal aid, proportional to the number of people who've seen it, and the 'damage' it has done.

This would allow average joe to happily sue the media.

I appear to be really un-popular for saying this, but I'd hate to live in a country where someone can't say something that's wrong.  How is the line drawn?  Who draws it?

What if its wrong to say that PoliticionA is been bigoted?  It's a scary thought.  Back when something like homosexuality was illegal people were free to print press stories that promoted it.  I don't see how you can have a legal framework which would allow that, but not Littlejohn.

And with hormones I pass 100% (unless I'm in brighton, then people still think I'm a lesbian, but I could have a beard and people would assume I was a lesbian in brighton). Sure, I have a speed bump on my chest from my bound breasts, I'm short, have child sized hands, my lips are permanently ruby red and I have an amazing amount of junk in my trunk with added childbearing hips - But no one looks at me and things ""wow, that's a cuntboy right there"" or whatever. Maybe if they look really closely they might think my body is oddly proportioned, but that's about it. 

Also, if violence is going to be committed against a trans person, almost every time, it's against a trans woman. 

There are things that suck about being a trans guy, like our genital surgeries are no where near as advanced, but we also gain a lot with our new found male privilege (hence we get paid more then cis women, because men do in general).

There were warnings all over the facebook groups and such, about if you knew anything to be careful who you talked to.

true,slothzen,crest,Europa Group Of Death Winning Trophy,"I sympathize with your position, but I just don't see it.  It seems foolish to do away with Moyes based on a hope that we could do marginally better and get an FA cup or Champion's League spot.  You claim with firmness that there is so much more to achieve - which is true - but I think it is farther from the ability of our current squad than you seem to think it is.  It's very optimistic of you.

What we have now and have had is stability with an outside chance of European competition and Cup.  Top 4 scalps a plenty - a well respected manager with a penchant for clever market dealings.  That's...fucking awesome.  Compared to before - like older blues have mentioned - when we we're getting under 10nth and barely escaping the drop.

I understand what you want and I love that you want it.  But that's what Arsenal strives for, and they outspend us 4 to 1.  We get to dream and talk the way you do because of Moyes.  The club is not 'stagnating' - no where close.  It's stable at the worst and vibrant at its best.  Moyes has been as good as can be expected in the transfer windows under the circumstances.  He stokes the fire, and he does it well based on that rebound victory vs City.

For me, there's just not a better choice than Moyes unless one of the big names wants a humble project.  Even then - I'm not so sure that I would sacrifice all that tenure.  To me it's a good thing that Moyes gets to work on the same project year after year.

true,thatstevelord,cnty-england,AmazingBlazingBasingstoke,"On the consumer scale you can use 0% interest free deals to conduct arbitrage against savings (this worked best at the height of the credit bubble, where you'd get a card that had 0% interest for 6 months, do your shopping, put the money in a high interest account and clear the card at the end of the 6 months then move on).

At the slightly higher scale, credit can be used to fund all kinds of things to your advantage, providing you can calculate a return that exceeds the costs of the credit. For example, lets say that you want to start a chip van but your startup costs are going to be about £5,000. You scrape together £2,000 from friends and family and try to get another £3k from the bank but the terms for the £3k are pretty horrific. With £2,500 and at the right time of the year, the person you're talking to is more likely to give you better terms as they have a sale on loans and £2,501 crosses the £2,500 loan level. Consequently you save around 2.5% on your loan, which you then use to reduce your payments in the short term but have no penalty on earlier repayments. You get your van, sell like hot cakes (no pun intended) then pay the debt off early, decreasing your liabilities for years two and three.

However - your accountant is unhappy. By paying off all of your debt you've just removed a massive liability from your van company's balance sheet. This means that you can't offset the liability against your profits and you'll be taxed further, so you take out another loan and buy another van, this time using the first van as collateral to get better loan terms. Following your accountants advice you find the optimal amount to pay off in order to balance debt liability offsetting with corp tax, which only applies to profits, not your liabilities.

You've negotiated a credit facility with your suppliers. While this means you'll pay a bit more for produce and raw materials, the payments are staggered which makes cash flow easier.

Finally your van business takes off. You're now making so much money that it's sitting in the bank not doing anything and you're paying an awful lot of tax on it. It's time to put that money to work. So off you go to the bank again, this time you want money to buy a garage. You use capital from the first company to get a loan to set up a new garage, and of course the garage company charges your first company full whack for repairs - a fair price but no mates rates. You have some of the best serviced burger vans in town and a thriving garage business specialising in vans and trucks, but the profits are distributed amongst the two thus reducing the tax liabilities associated with a single company and the loan risk is tied to only one company, not both.

TL:DR Debt can be used to offset other liabilities (as you're not taxed on debt for example) or to your advantage when the return exceeds the amount you pay for the facility.",0,1363908476,null,0,false,0,c9037sz,t3_1aqprz,t1_c9037sz,t1_c9027wg,null,1431662599,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

I thought his assumption that St Mary Magdelen's School is just as bigoted as he is the most shocking part. It was also perhaps quite revealing of how he justifies his mindset.

Then I read the worst part: him recommending that she should sacrifice her entire identity to save some parents explaining something perfectly natural to their children.

Of course the boy was worried and confused. He doesn't understand and most likely has a strong mental image of what it means to be a boy. So of course it worries him. He doesn't want to have tea parties with girls and would rather play footy with the boys. He's just afraid that one day that he could lose the thing he loves most and be tricked into doing something he's ashamed of.

This is all an inescapable symptom of how society (at the moment) teaches us to think. Boys do and think like that. Girls do and think like this. Heaven forbid if a man is wearing what he fucking well pleases. Good god. He doesn't want to be living and breathing in an identity he cannot stand to live in and wants to be do something about it.

Sexual identity is imaginary. Only our wobbly bits are different shapes and in different places.

We're all human beings so act like one and for fuck sake think before you speak. I am fuming. I've just realised that this is the first Daily Mail article I've ever read. The headlines have just been too dissuasively and unimaginably senseless I've never gotten any further.

A friend of mine made the same decision as you to not go to university after sixth form and do an OU course in something she loves as the idea of uni didn't appeal to her and wasn't worth the money. She's now a lot better off than those who have just graduated as she has spent the last three years working alongside the course and rising to a Supervisor position, all while doing the course for free. While it wasn't her intention, the situation has worked out fantastically in her favour. 

I can understand how the OU doesn't give you the same excitement as moving away from home and living on your own in a new city but in return you get an equally good course and you're more likely to do something you enjoy.

I disagree, that is a key skill. You cannot fully understand the scale of large or small numbers unless your mental arithmetic skills are at least good.

&gt; Our education system need to adapt to the new reality, of teaching critical thinking, understanding, comparative filtering and everything else that comes with having a wealth a information instantly at your finger tips.

The education system needs both. A lot of the development of hard scientific skills does actually come down to brute repetition. You repeat and repeat, and solidy your knowledge of a toolbox of techniques. You need the ability think critically on top of this, not as a replacement. The two are complementary. I agree though that Gove has shifted it too far the other way, and the emphasis on things like classics is completely bizarre.

One direction the train tracks go from Belfast is along the north coast, so you could look at staying in the towns of Antrim, Ballymena, perhaps as far as Coleraine or Portrush, or you could go the other direction and stay in Lisburn, Portadown or Newry perhaps. 

The north coast route is probably the more scenic route, and gives you access to the beautiful north coast (there's a stop at Portrush), and also access to NI's second city, Derry/Londonderry.

Oh and I wasn't implying you were gay, just it would be poetic in my mind if you were as hypocritical as people such as Cardinal Keith O'Brien.

'Transgender propaganda' reminds me of phrase 'merciless prism of equality' used by blowhard Edward Leigh MP in his remarks about why gay people should be denied the right to marry. Just as inherently ludicrous.

You really cannot empathise with people who are different to you, can you? See that they are just as human as you, and in this case, their differences pose to no threat to you or anyone else. You really believe that making children aware, in simple terms, that what this young lady had to do is 'sickening'. You woud transpose your own irrational revulsion at others onto children, breathlessly believing they must possess the same mentality as you.

8 Eggs

4 slices of bread

Chicken with egg fried rice and some vegetables (Main meal of day)

Shake of oats, whey, sainsburys skimmed milk powder

Peanut butter

50g Sainsburys own brand all bran.


Various potent hot sauces, and intense (eg good value) flavoring agents 

It works out around 2.80 last time I totted up, with the chicken being by far the largest single part.

This is mixed up in different combinations depending on mood. I'm at the point where I can roughly calculate how to add and take away things on the fly. Myfitnesspal is also great for working out the details and getting them in my head.

Sardines are a frequent contender for a place (about 200 cal a tin, depending on type, 20g protein). As are black beans, and lentils. 8 eggs is unusually high for me, but it makes things incredibly simple, and I find them compellingly delicious. Moreso than sardines

Theres loads of options for cheap starches. Bulgar wheat, rice, pasta, bread, oats. 

The general building blocks for me are:

1) Sort out protein requirements. I do this with one major meat meal, add eggs, work out the protein I'm getting from milk, oats etc, then round it out with whey.

Whey is 0.8p per gram of protein, bought from myprotein.com Sainsburys powdered milk is an outstanding 0.5p or so per gram, and comes with lots of carbs as well.

2) Get 40% of the calories from cheap carb sources, including both soluble and insoluble fibre. Rice, bread, milk, knock-off all bran, anything really.

3) Round out the remaining calories with cheap fats. Oil, peanut butter

4) Check to see if there are any glaring micronutrient deficiencies. eg There's no point adding in a vegetable rich in vitamin a if you are getting loads of it from eggs or milk. 

It gets a lot easier to do this with a lessened protein requirement. Delicious *everyday* food is mainly about the cooking and seasoning. Past a certain point you need great ingredients. I wouldn't serve a dinner party this way. But when its just for you the criteria are slightly different.

As far as I'm concerned this could so easily be taken as a direct personal attack. To describe in detail an innocent individual, with pictures might I add, is totally unforgivable.

You don't need to understand the pure mathematics of every calculation from first principles. When you do Chemistry, you use various simplifications to understand the problem you're approaching. You don't try to understand everything at once, and that's the same for a ten year old as it is for a University Professor. 

This over-emphasis on understanding vs rote learning is a false dichotomy, and is actually a pretty damaging idea to give to a student. Everything you want to learn or to teach operates at some level of simplification.

This isn't to say people font act in their own interests, but certainly read up on behavioural finance - Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds is a good read as well. 

The tldr is that people aren't rational, not even on a deterministic 'random fluctuations cancel out' basis. There are repeatable, observable, human biases that make us prone to bad decisions, that cause serious systemic distortions. It's why people still spend all their money on Apple stocks, it's why most successful business leaders very seldom account for risk, or their own fallibility and actually make bad decisions more frequently than they should (see: spectacular business failures)

Newcastle, Liverpool and others were all interested in Van Wolfswinkel, but we beat them to his signing by offering €3.5m now, to help them pay wages, with the rest to follow in the summer.
Because a 3rd party owns part of him, the transfer has appeared on the stock exchange, so there's definitely something happening, but I don't think we've agreed personal terms yet. As far as I know no players at Lisbon are on more money than our current wage cap, so him signing for us should give him a wage increase that doesn't break the bank for us, and he'll also get the assurance he's actually going to get paid.

At our end, the cash up front is a risk if we now get relegated, but for a player of his quality, one worth taking. If we do go down, we may even be able to still sign him (if he wants to come) and afford him, although other signings may be prevented.

You might think, but you are wrong, it is as simple as that. Do you trust a doctor when they say other mental conditions are real? Why do you selectively choose this as untrue? A couple of examples of people switching back just shows it is complex and that your uninformed ""opinion"" is worthless as you know nothing about it, it doesn't disprove it - the doctors who acknowledge it also know about the cases you know, you don't have a monopoly on this information. They still acknowledge it and know a hell of a lot more about it than you. Why do you not believe them? 

Your willful description of it being a ""magical transformation"" is again nonsense. It is usually a condition people suffer with all their lives before they can have the change - which doesn't happen ""magically"" but instead through hormone therapy and operations - you know, medical things, not magic. 

You are the one lying to your children, you are allowing your own ignorance hide facts of life from them because you don't like them. That's the thing about facts, ""think"" whatever you want about them, you are wrong. 

Also, nice selective quoting, always a sign of desperation - I clearly meant I don't care about your worries about your kids being taught about transgender people.

true,teafaceisming,eu,Derby,"&gt;Well I think that other people's speech is not obliged to conform to your standards of positive idea formation, a term which incidentally I find rather offensive, if only because it sounds like the sort of bollocks a manager would spout during a pointless meeting. Littlejohn's article is fatuous and ill informed, but could never be reasonably considered to be incitement to hatred, even if that should be a crime, which is debatable.

It's a touchy subject and I tried to summarise it in two words, where there could be thousands. As I've said if you take a glance at Richard Moon's Journal on hate in Canada I linked, he tackles both sides on line drawing on hatred better than I ever could. However, it isn't really 'mine'.  There are some ways of tackling speech that I think are probably best, i.e for example we don't need Nazi marches/ideology in our society, based on the context/history we have evidence to suggest how that speech ends up. Basically we need to be as specific and explicit to every case possible so that the scales are not tipped and free speech at large is not chilled. On the other hand if we do nothing, human dignity is at stake.

&gt;This is such a mealy mouthed accusation that it could be levelled at any article which did not explicitly attack prejudice towards transsexuals. That's without noting that you have indulged in the bizarre habit of blaming one person for the actions of another. I'm hopefully not the only person in favour of punishing people for the crimes they actually commit. 

It's a hard case and I said it wasn't exactly the most explicit or dangerous speech and that the penalty needs to be in light of that. Furthermore, it isn't bizarre at all that incitement can be seen as a crime. Although with critical thought, we humans could be seen to be free, humans are inherently a product of their surroundings. Liberal ideology asserts that education is key to combating negative speech and I agree but that just isn't the case right now and something needs to be done about it. Hate speech is a very loud voice in the public arena and often catches people, especially in economic and educational depravity unawares. Furthermore extreme voices can often drown out arguably more reasonable voices. If we do nothing, things can get bad. Incitement leads to action, whether it be harassment or murder or otherwise and the people shouldn't just be unaccountable. This especially applies to the media who have an obligation to society, because of their inherent influence.

Contrastingly to highlight how 'bad' imo, incitement regulations in the US are, for example in [NAACP v. Claibourne Hardware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAACP_v._Claiborne_Hardware_Co.). An African American extremist group basically circulated a list of names of every black person that entered a white persons shop. The list of names were also circulated in one of NAACP's meetings and the speaker advocated violence against these individuals. This speech was protected under the First Amendment and a previous overturning in a similar case involving the KKK in Brandenburg v. Ohio. Now a staple in US law regarding incitement, if the action taken by third parties is not going to be imminent, right there and then, it is protected.",0,1363918683,null,0,false,0,c906jvc,t3_1aqo4q,t1_c906jvc,t1_c904fu2,null,1431664238,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,teafaceisming,eu,Derby,"Well partly intent, as I said before the writer here is pandering to a market that he knows will act on messages of hate. Whereas the radio show you have brought up were doing the interview more as a joke and it wasn't targeting an individual in such a way in which other people would act. However I think that partly there negligence should have still been penalised, though not to any great extent. 

As an addendum, I thought this case was hard too, in that it isn't directly inciting hatred and he has a disclaimer at the start that he doesn't hate transgendered individuals. In all honesty my post was more general, I just had a lot to get off my chest which I had been mulling over for a while. The fact is, it is hard to just say what is right or wrong without also crossing over into the actual penalties. I don't advocate some extreme crack down on these people, because yes that could put a collar on the media at large. Also we walk a fine line with internet freedoms and I am very conflicted about being relative with this platform because of its potential and also fragility.

The general means that are often used to ascertain whether or not something is harmful is roughly Mill's harm principle. Also in, [On Liberty](http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/m/mill/john_stuart/m645o/), he talks quite a bit about proximity. To be incitement, he asserts with his corn dealer analogy; If a mob is outside a corn dealers house and someone advocates action against the corn dealer it is likely to be acted upon because there is no thought between the incitement and the action. If someone is away from the house, then they have time to internalise the advocacy and then it is down to the individual.

However, in Mill's time the press wasn't even available to the public at large. Only really the gentry at the time. Now media is a much more powerful and immediate force. Even more so now that we carry portable internet devices with us at all times. My advocacy of looking at the media in such a light is because in our reality often voices of hatred are so loud and pervasive. Also deeper, I agree with the liberal perspective that Education is the key to being able to have free speech and to combat hate at its roots. Though to say that we have anything adequate yet, isn't right. 

I get where you are coming from, this is partly a criticism that Richard Moon talks about in the journal I linked, it is hard to draw the line between hate/not hate and it can be damaging. Though the opposite is also true. We have to find somewhat of a balance. I'm not exactly an expert, and only an undergrad, so I don't think I am in a position to find any better solutions now.

Most would agree that it is a clear example of prejudice and ignorance regarding transgender issues, but calling it a hate piece is going further than that without any real grounds for doing so (other than anger and outrage). In fact in criticising this article for its bigotry, the trans feminist writer Jane Fae referred to Littlejohn as writing ""relatively encouragingly"" about transgender issues ([Source](http://www.newstatesman.com/lifestyle/2013/01/how-trans-teacher-showed-adults-have-more-hang-ups-about-gender-primary-school-kid)) presumably due to Littlejohn's expression of sympathy and support for trans people at the head of his piece. I think you could legitimately call his article ignorant, uninformed, misguided, prejudiced but (unless we have a radically different understanding of the term) *hate piece* is an extremely loaded phrase that suggests something far more sinister than run-of-the-mill ignorance or prejudice, and although some people may think it an appropriate description, many would not.

Now that is anecdotal and only my experience of course but it's one of the easier examples to explain why I hold this view that has a real world context.

&gt;The education system needs both. A lot of the development of hard scientific skills does actually come down to brute repetition. You repeat and repeat, and solidy your knowledge of a toolbox of techniques. You need the ability think critically on top of this, not as a replacement. The two are complementary. I agree though that Gove has shifted it too far the other way, and the emphasis on things like classics is completely bizarre.

Again I'm not dismissing the need to actual learn thing or the value in straight up rote learning for some things. I just think Gove is trying to build an education system that would have made some sort of sense when he was 10 and makes none what so ever now.

&gt;Another things that's lost in this useless dichotomy between critical thinking and rote learning is the teaching of problem solving. There needs to be far more project-based work in schools, where you are expected to actually fulfil a concrete goal.

I'm not saying today's learning is perfect, far from it as I don't think it's nearly come close to adapting to and exploiting the changes we've seen in technology (mainly the internet) I just feel that Gove is taking in the opposite direction. Everything his trying to do is something I think will be seen as harmful down the road.",0,1363940232,null,0,false,0,c90blpb,t3_1aqdi8,t1_c90blpb,t1_c904jad,null,1431666744,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Ideally the system should end up with each player 'balancing' out around a certain rating. So eventually the top player that maybe wins 3 out of 4 games should be losing the same amount of rating from the game he loses as he is gaining in total from the ones he's winning if that makes sense.

If it always works as a +/-10 kind of thing, it means the top player could end up with a rating of 3000 by May and it becomes very hard for any new additions to the league to catch up if they join late. It also means that if a player is winning more than he's losing in general, the rating is based more of the number of games played than actual skill...
