2008 and was a golden year for landlords. The sudden and massive drop in housing prices meant that landlords like myself could buy property like it was candy. 

After the initial shock of the recession people quickly realised that prices would eventually go back up and money could be made. So landlords, who already had sizeable portfolios were able to leverage themselves into a position where they could, unlike a normal home buyer, get buy to let mortgages fairly easily, or if they had enough just pay cash for houses. 

It was kind if like seeing your favourite candy in the sweet shop that was usually quite expensive, suddenly be on a 2 for 1 offer. 

Every auction I've been to in the last 5 years has been a frenzy of landlords scrambling to buy as much as they can at a low cost. 

That all being said, I don't think it's the landlords that need regulation (I know I'm biased) but the first time (and second time) home buyers that need assistance to enter the market.

public sector employees
worked for trade unions at
the taxpayers’ expense in 2009-10. 

&gt;Under the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, part III section 168 a union representative is permitted to paid time off for union duties.

&gt;Trade union facility time provides the platform upon which union representatives in
workplaces in both the public &amp; private sector carry out often demanding and
complex roles which include provision of ad
vice to members, formal representation
of members in grievance and disciplinary
hearings and negotiating with managers
over terms and conditions. This amounts to union representatives receiving paid
time off work – but usually in work time
– for a relatively tightly-defined set of
trade union
duties
. The legal basis for these arrangements are set out in the
Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 and the ACAS Code of
Practice on ‘Time off for Trade Union Duties and Activities’.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I seriously don't understand how anyone can like *Pandorica/Big Bang*. To me, that was easily the worst Doctor Who story there's ever been. The new series is notorious for its awful season finales heavy on self-satisfaction and deux ex machina (series 2 arguably excluded), and that was by far the worst offender.

*The Girl in the Fireplace* actually hits on a lot of the Moffat tropes that annoy me; Doctor meets little girl, returns later to find girl grown up and for no reason at all in love with him (which is fucking creepy; Moffat has done that *three times* now, and this one was probably the worst one (""I just snogged Madame de Pompadour"")), does fuck-all of any interest, there's a monster designed by Rule of Cool rather than sense, and the obligatory attempt at emotional manipulation at the end that falls flat because Moffat can't write believable characters that viewers can get emotionally invested in.

*Blink* annoys me just because it introduced the Weeping Angels. It was the least bad of all the Angel episodes, of course, but otherwise just unremarkable. Moffat's misogyny was apparent in Sally Sparrow, but arguably not as much as in a lot of his other work.

Moffat is by far the worst offender when it comes to Jesus Doctor storylines. I really hate this trend of the Doctor being a universally feared and revered hero/villain who sends foes running at the mere mention of his name, which Moffat started in *Silence in the Library* (another particularly awful one). It's facile and cheap, and just adds to the list of reasons why the Doctor is no longer a likeable character people can relate to.

The thing is, I'm not looking back at ""all seven series""; I'm looking back at *all fifty years*. I love classic Who, and even the classic Doctors that I disliked at first grew on me. It's true they were of uneven quality, but being evenly shit isn't better. And this isn't a nostalgia thing: I watched the new series first (six series at the time), and only then went back and bought a bunch of the classic DVDs because I couldn't understand why Doctor Who would be such a cultural phenomenon based on that.

If I incur a business expense such as having to pay for a meal, then I simply remove how much the meal cost from my tax bill at the end of the month / year. If I incur a business expense such as the interest on a mortgage, then I just remove however much the interest cost me from my tax bill at the end of the year. It's how business has worked for decades, it's what everyone who owns a business does. 

That's why so many people, including people who work for the government, like to be ""contractors"" where they set up a company which takes like 10 mins and costs just £15 with Companies House, then all the costs of getting to work such as train travel, petrol, parking, food and meals at work during the days and even bills at home can be taken out of their tax bill at the end of the year, meaning if I earned £40k per year and paid £10k tax, meaning I take home £30k in cash per year when I was a normal employee, if I become a contractor and my train travel costs me £2k per year, then I only give the government £8k in tax and take home £32k per year. It's perfectly legal, and always has been.

For a landlord who runs their stuff through a business, the cost of the mortgage interest payments to the bank will be much less than they are making in profit on renting out the houses (otherwise there would be no point doing it), and so by offsetting the interest payments against tax they are basically getting a license to print money, and are only restricted in how many commercial mortgages their bank will give them.

It's also worth pointing out that once you set up a company and have a few properties on the company asset books, you will no longer need to get commercial mortgages to get money to buy properties, and will be able to get normal business loans, or even use your business overdraft (can be millions in some cases, business overdrafts start large), and so get much better rates of interest, if any interest at all, than the headline rates you are looking at and are surprised by how high they are.",0,1372975763,null,0,1372976027,0,caw2fpz,t3_1hmwij,t1_caw2fpz,t1_caw0zvu,null,1430581835,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

If a mortgage is 4% it would be better to be a private owner, unless your able to have some very high expenses, which would make the whole landlord thing non-profitable.

So if a private mortgage is 2.5% and a commercial is 6%, on a £300k propety, that means Stamp Duty, then the landlord is paying say £12k per year in interest, sure they net that off.  But ultimately, if the Landlord was charging about £1,200pcm which is about hte going rate for a £300k two bed, they would have a gross of £14.4k.  If they had a 66.6% mortgage that would mean interest of £8k.  Assuming they have no ground rend, or other costs, that gives a gross of £6.4k, but then you have small corp tax and CGT, meaning 20% and 33%.

So ultimately that means a profit net of about £4k, assuming some admin expenses.  So now we have a £300k investment, which delivers a net of 1.3%.  Wow.

The reason landlords invest is because it is seen as a very safe long term investment, which will only rise.

Your figures are guestimations which are wrong, a residential landlord will expect to get £8k  gross profit per year, from every £100k they invest in property, hence 8% yield. Normally as a landlord you look for terraced properties in poor condition around the £120k mark, as they bring in the best yield. You tart them up with the most basic essentials, then rent them out for about £800 per calendar month, brining you £9,600 per year, which is 8% of your initial investment, or an 8% yield on your money. Of course you have to take your interest payments and mortgage repayments out of this yield, but you are getting your mortgage paid for you, so after just over 10 years not only have you made roughly 4% per year on your money, but you've also got a free house.

true,Quazz,capaldi,Capaldi,"This author is grasping at straws pretty badly. 

&gt;Some fans argue that boys and men will be unable to relate to a Doctor who isn’t male. In fiction as in life, women and people of colour are expected to relate to the stories of white men and understand that we can never be the hero –but it never works the other way round. To expect little white boys to look at a black time lady and imagine themselves fighting her battles would be unthinkable.

Yes, they do argue that, because it's true. It's less true of grown men, but absolutely true of young boys. Especially around the age where they find girls ""icky"" they will not want to watch a show with a female lead character. They don't identify with it. We can argue about the why and what to do about it (hint you need to intervene BEFORE this point), but that's really not relevant to how it can be useful to them right now. 

&gt;Why is it so hard to conceive of a female Doctor, or a black Doctor? For the same reason that it’s so hard to conceive of a female president, or a black prime minister, or any world government or economic power not largely controlled by rich white men: because we cannot imagine it. Because we refuse to imagine it. Because the stories we tell ourselves and each other about power and history don’t often include women and non-white people in leading roles.

Really? Is that why there are female prime ministers, queens and so on? Because we can't imagine women in power? 

This is one of these typical arguments ""hurr durr people think only men can be in power that's why women are never in power!"" Except, even historically, this is completely incorrect. There have been loads of women in power.

&gt;It goes like this: somebody dreams up a far-out notion of how the world might look if things were different and writes it down or acts it out and, gradually, people are given permission to imagine other lives. The first black president of the United States cropped up in science-fiction stories in the mid-1960s; similar characters featured in the science fiction films The Fifth Element and Deep Impact, the hit TV series 24 and, that’s right, Doctor Who. People do the work of changing the world -- but stories give us permission to re-imagine it.

This would be an actual argument if the Doctor was some position anyone could get. It's not. It's a name, the one he chose. 

There would be no societal gain to making him female. Besides, it's not like it's a title that get passed down to the next person. It's the **same** person. I think a lot of people seem to try and forget that. 

There's a reason people have less issue with a non-white Doctor, as well and that's because race and identity tend to be pretty unrelated. It's not really part of one's personality. It can warp people's perspectives, but that's about it.

On the other side of the fence, we have gender/sex. This is a big part of identity, for everyone. Why else are there sex operations? Because people want to look the way they feel. If they feel like a woman, they want to look like one and vica versa. 

So, as a consequence, if the Doctor were to suddenly become female, then either there's a huge shift in his identification that we weren't informed of. (in fact it's being going to opposite direction where his male identification gets affirmed even further) or they're just doing it because they can and believe it will draw in more viewers. (spoiler: it won't)

You can argue outward appearance is just outward appearance, but ask anyone if they would want to swap sex for the rest of their lives. Most will say no. Hell, most would say no to even a year.

Kolo - he's a back-up. Good player, but doesn't have the fitness or youth to improve on last year's defence.

Agger - he'll be a starter.

Skrtel - he made something like 5 or 6 errors that led directly to goals last season. He's always been a little inconsistent, even at his best, and he was far from his best last year. He lost his place to Carragher last year, he's not going to walk back into it unless there's been a massive change over the last couple months. I don't know why you don't think he'll be sold, I'd be surprised if he stayed. 

Kelly - Has played less than 30 PL games, several of those as a sub and most as a right back. I'd love for him to grow into that role, but at the moment he can't even stay fit long enough to prove his quality.

Wisdom - Another player I like a lot, another player who's inexperienced and has mostly played at RB. Also speculation that he'll be loaned out for experience.

Coates - just not good enough for the style, arguably not good enough period. Not the most mobile and too slow. May develop into a good player in time, but unlikely to do it as a Liverpool player.

So everyone in the senior squad bar Agger is too inexperienced, injury-prone, didn't do enough last season or is 3rd choice at best - and a couple of those apply to some extent to Agger as well.

Look back at the points we dropped last season and think about how many of those could have been salvaged if we'd had, say, Papadopoulos (still the one player I want more than any other this window, whether that's realistic or not) playing in place of Carra/Skrtel.

Next, the presence of women leaders does not negate the fact people still have issue with the idea of women in power and that sexism is still an extreme issue for women running for office. Hell, the cotton ceiling is a perfect example of this. Women in power doesn't mean sexism such as this is gone just as a black president doesn't mean racism is over. 

While yes, the Doctor is the same person, all of his incarnations are very different in some ways. Each acts differently and even actively dislikes different regenerations of himself depending on which regeneration he is on.  Also, the fact I think you are forgetting is *he is not a human.* Perhaps switching sex is no big deal to them. Perhaps it is. Perhaps the regeneration changes the way he relates to his body and would prefer a female body that regeneration. Why not? That's how the writers would write it and you know they would. 

There have been bigger things that have happened to the Doctor. I can tell you *as* a transgender person that locking away my people like he did would effect me more than transition ever would. Ask a few other trans people about their experiences in the military and you will see bigger things happen and effect people more profoundly than gender can. Yes, it's pervasive and in our everyday lives. But, again, we are humans. 

He is an alien who thinks differently than a human in more ways than we know. This is a big deal to US because of how WE feel about him regenerating in a female form.

Palace on the other hand are a financially stable club, they don't need to sell Zaha and won't if they want to advance to the premiership (I know they've been promoted, but the deal was in January), to be convinced to sell a player of Zaha's quality it will take a rather large sum to sway them. 

Conversely, a club like Birmingham that does have financial concerns will sell their English talents for peanuts. They sold Butland, a very promising player who's been capped at international level, for £3.3m, Davies for £2.3m and Redmond for £2m.

The club have acted with clear plans in every aspect of this transfer window - early signings, sensible signings, not paying more than we think is reasonable, players being replaced before they've even left (Jonjo, Pepe) and sold quickly (Carroll) and I believe there's plans in place if Suarez is sold. Targets have been pursued quickly and with a clear strategy, and our targeting Papadopoulos, whatever comes of it, speaks to our plans to get in a long-term centrepiece for our central defence. I don't expect us to change that plan so quickly in the *hopes* that everything works out. That's the kind of thing we've done too much in recent years - Spearing playing in the first-team, Shelvey playing as a false-9, Skrtel playing as a right-back, inexperienced youngsters being given a lot of responsibility without knowing how they'll perform, we've done too much of that and that's not what gets you back into the CL. This is a big summer for the club, and that's the major deficiency in the squad at the moment, and not prioritising getting in a CB is really reckless at this point. Kolo's a good player, I don't think I'm underrating him at all and I think he'll add quite a bit to the squad, but he's also not a long-term solution and as you say, not someone who'll play that many games at his best. So who will? Someone who can't play a full season can't be relied on as a key player, he might turn out to be vital to the defensive unit but now's the one chance we have to add a player to the first team who can hold that position for a long and successful period, and I  know I'll be pissed if we don't do that.

2- Many public bins arn't emptied nearly enough, or arn't large enough to accomodate the volume of litter. Princes' Street Bins are a prime example

3- Ppeople on nights out... of course it's their fault but other cities I've lived/visted seem to have a much larger early morning street-cleaning effort for areas of heavy night-life.

The problem with this is that when Bale drifts inside (arguably when he is most effective) we'll need a striker to fill the hole left by him on the wing. Playing a 4-2-3-1 with Bale in the CF role it allows him to roam free making him much harder to defend against and more effective.

It can also be said that we should be playing different formations against different teams. When we played man city (3-1) and switched to the 4-3-3 when huddlestone we looked so much more dangerous because the front 3 had much more space to work. When playing sides that park the bus we should play a 4-4-2 or 4-4-1-1 so Lennon can be more effective in the wider role, and we'll have more room to move the ball through a midfield of 4 rather than 3.

At what point does a ""bad spell"" become long enough to decide to not hold onto a player? Half a season is pretty damn long, especially given there weren't any signs of improvement by the end of it. 

Also, Skrtel's performance under Kenny is as irrelevant as Carroll's performance under Kenny is. We're playing very differently, both in attack and defence, and the same way that Carroll doesn't fit with what Rodgers is doing, Skrtel's shown he doesn't fit either.

&gt; Carragher would never have gotten the same game time had he not announced his retirement. I'm not dishing Carragher, but it was pretty obvious that this is what was happening in the managers mind.

Really can't disagree with this enough. Carragher was in the team for a good month at least before any word about his retirement. He got in there on merit, end of.

I don't approve of the methods of course compared to modern standards and probably stretching standards back then.

Any infrastructure was built to serve our interests but it has benefitted the countries in the long run to a large degree and still does. India's railways being an example. 

The massacre you've linked is possibly one of the worst cases I've read, and I've came across it before. There is a general theme running through these incidents as far as I can see which highlights the vulnerability felt by British people living in India. Following on from the Indian Mutiny of 1857, it seems like we were always nervous and jumpy at any point where there was any degree of unrest and attacks on British people and installations were always compared to the likes of the Mutiny. People felt backed into a corner and as a result make stupid decisions. Obviously this is a generalisation and there were so clear exceptions, this case referenced may well be so as of simple extreme violence, even drawing condemnation from Churchill who didn't exactly pussyfoot around these issues.

true,TomShoe,1972crest,,"I think it was less about having someone who would say yes to everything, and more about having someone who wouldnt say no. I dont think Txiki and Soriano wanted someone they could walk all over, I think they wanted someone they wouldn't have to walk all over because he'd be walking in the same direction, some who wouldn't fight them on their vision, not because they were spineless, but because they shared the vision, and I think Pellegrini was ideal for that. Now whether or not that's a good vision is another question entirely. 

There's no question that it's heavily inspired by Barca, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing, nor is it necessarily a good thing. It all depends on how they approach this vision of theirs. Barca has done a wonderful job turning the general aura of their club—it's history, it's philosophy, its playstyle, it's relationship with its city—into a global brand, and I think that you could easily do that with a club like City. The trouble is making sure its *our* club that they're doing this with, not Barcelona in sky blue. It needs to take into account both the past greatness, and past hardships of the club, it's ties to the community, the general idea of the club as being both representative of and a service to the city it calls home, but that city is Manchester, not Barcelona. It's not a Catalan city with a reputation for flamboyance and independence, it's a northern English city with a reputation for culture, but also hardship, and the one is related to the other. It's a city of revolution both technological and social, of music and revelry, as well as hard work, and hard times. It's a club by, for, and of its people, and I think there's an appeal to that on the global stage, they just have to be willing to sell Manchester the way they sold Barcelona, rather than just selling Barclona in blue.",0,1372997961,null,0,1373165609,0,caw82ys,t3_1hn0oi,t1_caw82ys,t1_caw038j,null,1430579104,6,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,6

Yes, you do need a visa. Coming here to look for work is *highly* illegal, and if the border agency finds out you did such a thing you'd be banned for a bit.

Whilst programmers are on the [skills shortage list](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/workingintheuk/shortageoccupationlistnov11.pdf), only those few types are. So if you're not one of those kinds of programmers, then you probably won't be able to get in. Additionally, you should hopefully have a relevant bachelors degree or else you probably won't get hired.

Honestly, the UK is one of the hardest countries in the EU to immigrate to. They have very strict visa requirements and give out a limited number of visas per year.

Eleven is immature. I don't mean to say that he is immature because he likes to have fun, but that he acts as if he has never experienced loss or any other serious issues before.

* Kelly's not playing as a centre-back and Wisdom's better anyway. Wisdom did play as a part of a back 3 but I still think it's very unlikely he'll play as a typical CB. So unless the coach goes bananas and tries to use that system long-term, I think he's a shoe-in for RB in the greater picture. I'm curious as to why so many around here think Kelly's a good shout for centre-back. Can someone explain? And yes I know he played there at youth levels.

* I think everybody likes Coates as a guy but I've not seen anybody who thinks he's good enough, certainly not since 2011-12. This is such a huge position that it's probably a waste of everybody's time to keep him at the club and he deserves better than wasting away.

So, in reality, I think we actually have two centre backs in Toure and Agger. We need two more, I think.

true,Mayniac182,cnty-england,London,"Harm reduction, essentially. Like how we tell kids ""drinking is fine, just don't do it in excess"", and ""don't drink and drive"".

Dosages: give people the right range of dosage for different drugs, encourage them to buy scales, and say what the effects of an overdose are with different classes of drugs and what to do if someone is OD'ing. Most of the time there's nothing more you can do than call an ambulance, but some people are genuinely afraid of calling 999 because they're afraid they'll get in trouble by the police. That needs to be stopped.

Addiction: teach the difference between psychologically and physically addictive substances. Tell people how to recognise when they or someone they know is addicted and what to do (intervention, counselling, referral to NHS). Try to get people non-judgmental of addicts at a young age and treat them like human beings who just need help, and we may see a reduction in the amount of drug addicts we have.

Safe needle use: at the very least telling people where their closest needle exchange is. Linked in with addiction as well, if people know where to get clean needles they can at least help addicted friends to not get HIV.

And general harm reduction: take MDMA. I remember when we had police come to our school to tell us about the danger of drugs, they told us that ecstasy made you sweat and dehydrate and could cause you to die that way. They never said ""Drink about half a liter of water an hour and avoid too much alcohol"" for example, or not to mix amphetamines with MDMA due to serotonin syndrome. Or with psychedelics, we were told that ""you could have a bad trip which would drive you insane"", not to make sure we were in a comfortable place with people we trust before taking psychedelics, or how to calm someone down who's having a bad trip.

1 guy voted for Bruma as his fave Chelsea player. Nice try Bruma.

6 guys voted for Rafa. Rafa's family, nice try as well.

2 guys voted for Raneri, which is weird cause I could've swear that I couldn't find his name on the poll when I was voting.

I lol'd when on the question: What team do you hate. Everyone wrote Spuds,Arsenal,UTD or other Chelsea rivals and some cheeky American wrote Portland xD 

Also: 

Q: Why do you support Chelsea ?

Answer from someone: my dad is a Man U fan

true,Quazz,capaldi,Capaldi,"Thank you for replying.

&gt;First off, this show isn't just for young boys, it's for every one. Your argument on that point would hold water if this was aimed at exclusively at one demographic.

I'm aware. I realize my argument wasn't complete. I forgot to mention how the Doctor is one of the only good male role models in fictional media. 

Also, for some reason, girls seem to mind a lot less if a guy is leading actor or not. I guess girls are being raised a bit more neutral than guys generally speaking. 

At any rate, all over the media you got men being portrayed as fat, ugly and dumb in sitcoms and ads and the like. Then in other media, usually more action oriented, it's usually this shallow person who has a lot of sex, but doesn't care about the person, really, all the while they tend to love violence.

Women are often portrayed as the exact opposite, as some sort of ying yang kind of thing. It's worth noting that this is not true where men are portrayed in a normal fashion. 

&gt;Next, the presence of women leaders does not negate the fact people still have issue with the idea of women in power and that sexism is still an extreme issue for women running for office. Hell, the cotton ceiling is a perfect example of this. Women in power doesn't mean sexism such as this is gone just as a black president doesn't mean racism is over.

I wasn't arguing that at all. Sure, sexism and racism exist, but to go as far as to flat out state people can't possibly imagine having a woman in power is plain ridiculous considering there are plenty of examples to go about. One needs to only open their eyes to SEE it, no need to imagine it, it's right there.

&gt;While yes, the Doctor is the same person, all of his incarnations are very different in some ways. Each acts differently and even actively dislikes different regenerations of himself depending on which regeneration he is on. Also, the fact I think you are forgetting is he is not a human. Perhaps switching sex is no big deal to them. Perhaps it is. Perhaps the regeneration changes the way he relates to his body and would prefer a female body that regeneration. Why not? That's how the writers would write it and you know they would.

At least since the Moffat era, he has identified more and more like a man than anything else. You can ascribe that as just a personality thing, but I feel that 12 incarnations (if we include John Hurt already) would argue against that. If regeneration were completely random, he would not be male 11 times in a row. (I mean technically sure, but those odds are kind of ridiculous) He's also been a humanoid every time, while that's not technically required. He could become a velociraptor technically given from what we know. But we also know they have some control over their regenerations. We can argue about how much. Also, in the face of his timetravelling, this could purely be a convenience choice. 

&gt;There have been bigger things that have happened to the Doctor. I can tell you as a transgender person that locking away my people like he did would effect me more than transition ever would. Ask a few other trans people about their experiences in the military and you will see bigger things happen and effect people more profoundly than gender can. Yes, it's pervasive and in our everyday lives. But, again, we are humans.

That's fair, I'm not saying it's the end all, but it is indeed part of one's identity. Yes we are humans, but the Doctor on the other hand loves humanity and sometimes aspires to be one. He doesn't just admire humanity, he also seems to be jealous of it at times. 

&gt;He is an alien who thinks differently than a human in more ways than we know. This is a big deal to US because of how WE feel about him regenerating in a female form. Again, bigger things have happened. I get not liking the idea, I really do. However you seem to be actively hostile about this which I don't get seeing as we will probably never have a female Doctor.

Most of the way he thinks is pretty damn similar to humans. It's mostly his attunement to time and social awkwardness (which may just be a regeneration quirk) that are atypical. Sure, most of his thoughts are hidden as are his stances and such, so I guess that's fair enough. 

Although, he did seem a bit distraught when he thought he was a girl just after regenerating.

Then of course there comes the inevitable decline. If dealt with gracefully and sensibly, you can retain prosperity and end up with a happy population. If you go the other way, however, and try to act like you're still in charge, pissing other countries off and spending stupid amounts of money on your military still then the transition won't be great.

I understand and totally respect the effort and vision it takes to get something like this off the ground so please don't think I'm trashing your hard work. But I do have a couple of observations that I hope you find useful...

I get your USP - individually vetting accommodation rather than relying on user reviews. But I wonder why this (and a few other bike focused accommodation sites out there) focus so much on 'friendly' (being allowed to stay there even though you're on a bike)

I've traveled all over the UK, Europe, the US and parts of Central America on my bike staying in a mix of dive hotels (when I'm on my own) and 3-4 star places (when I'm with Mrs biskino). I've never been turned away from a hotel when I've showed up on a bike and have only had a handful of experiences where I would say I was treated with trepidation because of it. Are you sure you're solving a problem that exists?

For me, three things that would make a motorcycle accomodation site a 'must use' would be...

-Information about safe off-street parking for my bike. (there is no mention of parking at all [here for example] (http://www.motogoloco.com/brynafon-hotel-ac-46-a-23). For this alone I'd be more likely to use trip adviser or booking.com (who at least offer info about parking in general). 

-Information about what is close to the accommodation that is of interest to bikers (great roads, race tracks, bike oriented cafes/bars, bike related events in the area, motorcyle shops nearby etc.)

-Integration with other free route planning resources. You could even consider creating DIY tour packages by integrating with sites like [Best Biking Roads] (http://www.bestbikingroads.com/) and [Tyre] (http://www.tyretotravel.com/)

Hope that helps and best of luck with motogoloco!

Looking at rents in London I can't see anything that would yield such values.  Most two beds that rent anywhere from £1-2kpcm cost £300-500k.

Using HSBCs data, its 3.94% for a private, 5% for a commercial mortgage at their SVR.  The effect of netting off the tax for the interest there is minimal, considering the difference between the two rates.

Those figures aren't exactly made up, they are the flat I'm living in, last year I considered moving away for a little while and looked at the economics of renting it.

Where do I go to get an 8% yield?  Does that including marking up the rise in value of the property?

But my point is still valid, build more housing stock, if landlords are *consuming the market* to drive rents up, they will not be able to do so if there is plenty of supply.

The fact in London we see more and more houses turned into effective bedsits isn't because Landlords are evil barstards, its because there are people desperate for a room.

There's your problem right there. The best yields aren't in London.

Added to that, your figures don't work because most landlords don't buy properties at the high market rates you see in estate agent windows, for example they will find someone in negative equity struggling with the mortgage, and offer them 75% of the value of the property, or buy much lower at auction from repossessed properties.

I regularly smoke cannabis, which I enjoy and love to do (I don't drink). And as it's illegal, I make sure I know what's what etc. I also feel that cannabis should be legal, taxed and regulated for various reasons, and have to often defend my choices and reason for this. 

So when people always try and belittle me for smoking cannabis and say it's illegal to smoke it, I always get my 1up on them saying that it's not actually illegal to smoke it, or use any other drug for that matter. 

As you stated, it would be very hard to smoke cannabis, while not having it my possession, but alas, that is the way it is at the moment. 

There is a whole bunch of grey area in the drugs laws in the UK, such as it is illegal to grow cannabis, but you can buy cannabis seeds, legally, buy all the equipment you need to grow it, legally, but as soon as you put that seed in the soil, BLAM! you're a criminal. crazy shit!

true,dayus9,,,"*Wanked off a cock* - sounds wrong to me, assuming you mean the body part and not the animal, or that you were standing on a cock and wanking off of it. The verb 'wank off' already assumes there is a cock or a fanny involved, depending on the person doing it, although wank is more common for a man than a woman, but it's common in some places to use it for women too. 

*I wanked a cock* - This to me makes me think you're giving a tug to a cockerel, for some of the same reasons as the first one. 

*She is wanking a cock* - Again with the animal thing, however this one, while is sounds a bit weird, does sort of work because without the word cock the assumption would be that she was playing with herself. More common would be to say who she is wanking, rather than just saying a cock. 

*She is wanking off a cock* - As above really. 

*I wanked a goat* - Makes sense to me, even if it's a bit nasty, but the next one is probably more common. 

*I wanked off a goat* - Same as the previous one. 

So in summary...

Wank can be transitive and intransitive, meaning you can do it to yourself or another more often than not, talking about wanking a cock just sounds weird to men (unless it's a cock's cock), it's better to say who. 

Wank off is usually used in a more transitive sense, so you wank off a person more than you wank off yourself, because it's easier to say I'm wanking than I'm wanking off. 

It can get more complicated than that I expect, but that's how I see it based upon your examples.

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"""Capacity factor"" is the percentage of a generator's rated maximum that it actually produces on average.  A 50% capacity factor 1GW generator would produce 500MW on average.

 - Capacity factor of windpower: 20%
 - Capacity factor of nuclear: 98%

To back up the intermittent and unpredictable wind, we have to have traditional power stations on standby.  A traditional power station on standby runs at considerably lower efficiency than if it is run at capacity.  So much less efficient is the traditional station that if the total power output of wind+inefficient backup is considered, then you are actually generating more CO2 than if you had just run the backup station at capacity and never bothered with the wind power.

Wind power is one giant PR exercise -- it certainly isn't ""renewable"" under any reasonable engineering definition.  The reason the west has run with it is because all other green energy forms need more research to make them viable, but wind power technology is as understood as it's going to get.  Politicians always want to be _seen_ doing something, even if that something isn't, ultimately, sensible.

TLDR; it is nothing to cheer about that our government has spent our money on a white elephant merely so they can hold up their heads when they go to environmental conferences.

---

The present

 - Nuclear fission is it.  There is no cleaner practical technology available right now.  Unfortunately the lead time for building nuclear reactors and the anticipated power requirement curves for the UK do not mesh and we're likely to start getting brown outs, even if we started building them in earnest today.  Ask yourself why the government is suddenly so desperate to get smart metering rolled out?  It's because very soon they know they're going to have to start managing demand, which they will do with variable pricing.  i.e. your electricity is about to get considerably more expensive.
 - Shale gas.  It's pretty clean, and can probably be brought online fast enough to tide us over until the future arrives...

The future (incidentally, the development of these technologies receives not even 1% of the money that has been spent and allocated to wind power):

 - Solar power.  The energy falling on us from the sun is staggering.  It makes nuclear power look like a sparkler.  The problem now is that it's woefully inefficient.
 - Graphene looks like it could be magic.  Seriously.  It could be the key to an enormous number of society-changing technological leaps.  Not least of which -- the ability to efficiently convert between photonic energy and electronic energy.  This would make efficient solar energy, efficient power transmission, and efficient power storage.
 - Nuclear fusion
 - MicroCHP.  All energy ends up as heat.  If you can make use of that energy in the meantime you get heat for free.  For example, where it not for the price differential between gas and electricity, your fridge would be free (at least in the winter) because the energy it uses to keep it's inside cold simultaneously heats your house.  MicroCHP is the idea that we should ditch our electricity supply (the transmission of which is only 60% efficient, the rest going to heat up the wires used to send it) and use fossil fuels directly on premises to generate electricity; the electricity eventually ends up as heat, and the generator naturally makes heat.  A mass installation of CHP boilers would pull the UK energy needs back into line with capacity.  Note: legislation doesn't consider CHP ""green"" because it uses fossil fuels.

Windpower is particularly annoying because you don't get 20% of rated maximum all the time.  What you get is a burst of 90% for a while, then nothing.  We have no good technology for energy storage, so we're screwed for the times the wind isn't blowing.  Therefore we need backup, therefore we're running the backup inefficiently, therefore we end up producing more CO2 than if we had never bothered with all this mess.

Your view about the wind is wrong, there isn't a fixed amount of wind in the UK and it just moves about.  Windy periods are windy everywhere.  It's also not true that the wind only stops for a day.  It's not just about there being wind; wind turbines have to be designed for a particular wind speed.  If the wind is too weak then you get very little power, if the wind is too strong you have to lock your turbine down to stop it running itself to destruction.  The engineers aren't stupid so they pick the optimal running speed to get the most power most of the time.  That's very different from ""wind blows = power"".

It's simply not true that if we put them everywhere they would make what we need.  Also -- the incredible cost of putting them everywhere would still mean there are better, greener, things that could be done with that same money.

I currently work in PR for a record label in London but before I went University I was studying Music Tech, I looked at a lot of institutions which had huge facilities and a lot of in industry work experience. However upon visiting many of them it came to light that a lot of them offer 1 or 2 year so called 'boosted' courses which push degree into a short time period. This means that work loads are extremely high and if you fall behind too far you can be left in the dust. 

I had an Interview with [SAE](http://london.sae.edu/en-gb/home/) which came with recommendations, they have a 2 year production course which had a lot of hands on projects and work experience using multi million pound systems. The darker side to SAE was that students are basically required to studying pretty much every day including weekends to keep up with the schedules, if you fall behind you can get help but if you struggle you will be left behind. 

The drop out rate was around 70% as students didn't get the help they needed because the lecturers were still working mostly part-time or full time in the industry, this is a good as the information you receive is always up to date however they have a lot of down time where they are unreachable if you need help with work. 

TL;DR: Do your research on institutions and try to come over for a few open days to take a look around, ask as many questions including negatives like drop out rates and expected studying hours. No need to kill yourself when you can get the same degree from a University with full time staff.

You can't splice a single frame of your product into something else, but that's just one easy-to-prove-it-happened technique anyway. Subliminal advertising is done all the time by the [definition of ""subliminal""](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/subliminal), but there's probably no sane way to ban it.

For example, ordinary TV adverts are repeated ad tedium. So after a while you don't pay conscious attention to them. So they're effectively subliminal. The same applies to a billboard you travel past every day. But how often you see an advert and how much conscious attention you pay to it is determined by your behavior, not just the advertisers. They can claim they're just trying to make sure they reach everyone, or that some people enjoy seeing their adverts - and that's not even a lie, let alone disprovable.

Then there's product placements - they're *supposed* to be unintrusive. You're not paying conscious attention to that detail so the effect is subliminal. Even if you ban adverts completely, this subliminal effect still exists.

The biggest problem with subliminal advertising is that people *believe* it's illegal, yet it's everywhere in perfectly legal forms. The greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing the world that he did not exist.

Even so, IMO this particular trick *should* be banned, and certainly should be recognised for what it is.

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"You're correct; that's exactly what it means.

The problem is that you _have_ to have the backup to meet demand (or the lights go out).  Traditional power stations are surprisingly efficient, but _only_ when they've been up and running for a while. (in the case of nuclear I believe it's on the order of weeks).

You can keep some types of them on standby so that they can come online quickly, which they have to be able to do or the lights go out when the wind dies.  Unfortunately in that state they aren't running at their full power efficiency.  What does low efficiency mean?  It means that for the same amount of input fuel, you get considerably lower output power.   So, instead of burning (made up numbers), say, 1000 tonnes of fuel to get 1000MWh of output, you have to burn 2000 tonnes -- for the same output.  It's easy to see then that unless you produced more than 1000 tonnes-of-fuel worth of energy with your wind power, and hence reduced CO2 proportionately, you've actually spent more CO2 than you would have had you just let the traditional power station get up to full efficiency.

The actual crossover point is probably calculable fairly easily given the capacity factors of the power plants in their various states; but it's a bit more work than I want to do for a reddit post ;-)

Edit: Here's a dutch paper criticising the model that Big Wind uses. http://www.clepair.net/windSchiphol.html which actually has some non-made up numbers.

---

Edit2: I meant to say earlier as well that you know you're being bullshitted when they say things like this:

&gt; With enough capacity to power two-thirds of the homes in Kent, the set of 175 turbines rising out of the Thames estuary officially became the largest offshore windfarm in the world on Thursday.

Note that they _always_ use the bigger number, which is rated capacity, rather than the rated capacity times the capacity factor.  That ""two-thirds of Kent"" is only true when the wind is blowing.  After the 20% reduction, that 66% of the county becomes 13%.

---

Edit3: Sorry to keep updating :-)

Here's a copy of a study by the environmentalist group, the John Muir's trust (they are definitely not shills) from 2011 on how awful the wind power in the UK was in 2010:

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"&gt; Jamie Carragher was 35 years old last season and was at times playing up to two games a week. Had he intended on playing on until next season, he would have been used more sparingly so as to save some of his legs.

That's probably true; so in that case, if Carragher didn't retire, Skrtel would've got more games. But those wouldn't have been games he got ""on merit"" for performing better than Carragher - those would have been games he got because Carragher wasn't playing twice a week. So really, Carragher's retirement is irrelevant to the fact that by the end of January, Rodgers had decided that Skrtel was not performing as well as Carragher in his lineup.

&gt; How can you argue who Skrtel's good form was under? 

Erm, by looking at when he was in good form, and who was manager then. He was player of the season last year, and Kenny was manager. Saying his new contract came under Rodgers is like saying Roy Hodgson signed Joe Cole - neither of those are true. You think contract negotiations with Skrtel hadn't been ongoing well before Rodgers came in? And when Rodgers came in, he wouldn't have known it wasn't going to work with Skrtel - he'd have hoped it would. From his point of view, why wouldn't you OK a new contract for a player-of-the-season defender whose current contract only has 2 years left?

Then this season happened, Rodgers decided Skrtel wasn't working out, and now we're open to offers for him. If we don't get any, he may well stay and Rodgers will take another crack at making it work with him. If we do, and we get a replacement in that Rodgers thinks works better, then fantastic, lets see if Rodgers is right about that replacement.

&gt; Sick of fans turning on players like this. They'll be lording him again next season when he gets back in the team.

Nobody's turning on anyone. Skrtel's a good defender, and he's CL quality if he can replicate last season's form. But I can't see him doing that in a style of play that he's uncomfortable with, which is why it's best to move him on and bring in someone that does fit. I hope he goes somewhere that works for him and does well, and even if he does I won't think it was a mistake to sell him - he's just not a good fit for Rodgers.",0,1373023642,null,0,false,0,cawclew,t3_1hnsz1,t1_cawclew,t1_cawcgfw,null,1430576906,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

true,JackXDark,null,null,"Repost from previous thread, but CBA to rework it in an original way or fuck about linking it:

I should preface this comment by stating that it is theory and speculation, not allegation and I do not have an especially informed position.

So, with that caveat...

People who're at No10 but not in the cabinet implies that it's an advisor involved. There have been guesses that it's Andy Coulson and Rebekah Brooks.

Both have been charged with offences relating to the News of the World phone hacking affair.
Allegedly, Brooks had a very strong influence on David Cameron choosing Coulson - another News International employee - as his communications director. There have been allegations, based on the content of text messages between them including an archaic vulgar pun, amongst other things, that Cameron and Brooks may have had a personal relationship that was inappropriate. They probably just about get away with that one, though, as there is no other evidence for it.

However, if Brooks and Coulson were indeed having an affair and this is in any way provable, then you've got Coulson completely in Rupert Murdoch's pocket via the massive leverage of either Brooks' vagina's own power or the threat of blackmail if the affair did come out, right in Number Ten.

It's a massively compromised position to start with, even without the fact that they're both awaiting trial over the phone hacking, perjury and attempts to pervert the course of justice.

So, yes, messy indeed.

If... and that's a very big if, Cameron was also shagging Brooks, and the triangle here means that this might come during the trial, then this might be a resigning matter for Cameron and hasten a general election.

Even if Cameron and Brooks weren't up each other, her having the leverage to get Coulson into Number Ten is worrying at best anyway, but if they were having an affair, is likely to be seriously embarrassing for Cameron. Possibly a resigning matter. Definitely one that will hurt him a lot.

TLDR It's speculated that it's Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson. They're both awaiting trial. They're also in Rupert Murdoch's pocket and, if true, gave him, via Brooks, massive leverage in government in terms of access to stories and potentially over policy too.

Not at all - all feedback is wholly welcomed, so thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts.

**EDIT** - actually on the 'friendly' point - you wouldn't believe just how many bikers still experience a negative response when they try to book or turn up on their bikes.  I posted a similar intro on a UK based biker forum a few days ago, and got responses along thoese very lines - http://www.bikething.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=909  

What we're trying to get across (perhaps not quite obviously enough though, yet) is that ALL of the places listed are ideal biking stop-off points, for exactly the reasons you've listed above.

They've either got secure bike parking (e.g. garages) or will make arrangements to suit - we've actually stayed at these places, with bikes in tow, hence why we're happy to endose them.

Locale info (eateries, great roads etc) you're spot on, and this is something we're actively working with the hotels/B&amp;B's to collate.  You'll see these sections starting to get padded out with good, locally sourced info just shortly.

You are also totally right about having to leave margin for others' errors, but this ad doesn't say that. This ad says ""bikers have the tendency to ride too fast and attempt risky manoeuvres. If only they wouldn't."" If they INSIST on pursuing the ""all motorcyclists speed"" fallacy, they ought (in my humble opinion) try to make sensible car drivers more aware of our existence, rather than preaching to those unsensible bikers who won't care anyway.

However they eventually achieved considerable success. ""At the 1873 Vienna Exhibition the French judges, tasting blind, praised some wines from Victoria, but withdrew in protest when the provenance of the wine was revealed, on the grounds that wines of that quality must clearly be French.""

Jacob's Creek is an alright drink. It's not bottom of the barrel, but it's very passable.  There are very few, if any, ""bad"" Australian wines. It's a very high-tech industry and they provide a consistent quality because of this. i.e. some countries may produce wines where a *certain vintage* will have more ""character"" but across the board the Australian wines will maintain a standard. If that makes any sense.

They're also not going to export their bad wines because there's so much competition.

Jacob's Creek has a massive range of wines, the supermarket ones are just the basic table wines. 

If you go to a specialist wine shop, you'll find their vintage/reserve range. I've been to the winery in South Australia and came home with a mixed half dozen ... for a couple hundred dollars. They were good wines and cellared well.

My all-time favourite is the [sparkling shiraz](http://www.mysupermarket.co.uk/sainsburys-price-comparison/champagne_and_sparkling_wines/jacobs_creek_sparkling_shiraz_750ml.html). Might not make as much sense in the English climate, but it's perfect for the Australian climate.

Ironically, due to taxes, Australian wines are actually cheaper to buy in the UK than in Australia!

EDIT: 

Having said all that, a bottle of Jacob's Creek classic range is not the right wine to bring to a nice dinner. It's a ""cellar filler"", but not something you open for a special occasion.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"&gt; To say a players past performances counts for nothing under a new manager is ridiculous. 

Well, they count for much less once performances under a new manager has a season with them. Skrtel's performances from last season counted insofar as they made him the first-choice CB going into this campaign, and it stayed that way for half a season. He lost the spot through poor form the same way he earned player-of-the-year the previous season through good form. 

&gt; Gerrard for example really struggled under the new system to the extent that Rodgers released the shackles from him from December onwards were his form picked up substantially...He's the perfect example of how not every player can adapt to Rodgers way and some need lee way to produce their best performances.

Gerrard struggled for the first 5-10 games, tops. He certainly didn't take until December to start returning to form. And I don't understand what you mean by Rodgers releasing the shackles - Gerrard's playing Alonso's old role, and that certainly requires a lot of shackling. If anything, in moving him deeper (he played as the attacking mid in the first few games of the season), Rodgers put more ""shackles"", more defensive responsibility, on Gerrard. He certainly didn't revert to being a box-to-box all-action midfielder the way he used to, and he'll probably never be that again. 

But there's the crucial difference - Gerrard adapted, while Skrtel didn't.

&gt; Were you advocating that Gerrard didn't suit the system and should be dropped back then? I doubt It.

Then let's say I had more faith in Gerrard's ability to adapt than I do in Skrtel's.

&gt; When Rodgers came in, if he didn't fancy him he would have been gone. Carroll was under a massive contract when he came in

I already dealt with this in my previous post - at that time, Rodgers had no idea Skrtel wouldn't work. Carroll not working was bloody obvious.

They haven't, because that would lower his price; maybe I shouldn't have stated that so definitively, I'm essentially speculating.

2) I would venture to say that only the typical ""glory supporters"" don't know much about London/England/the UK/Stamford Bridge.

In all honesty, I wish the location question wasn't part of the survey because it has never mattered to me one bit.

true,radlibox,null,null,"Short version: definitely apply - I've seen (much) worse GSCE results get offers, and in the end nothing ventured, nothing gained.

Long version: I can't speak directly to geography but most of the admissions stuff is true across the board. Admissions tutors look at a range of things when considering applications - GSCE results, A Levels/IB results/prediction, personal statements, references and your results on the 'Thinking Skills Assessment' (TSA) - the pre-interview aptitude test which you do before they make interview decisions these days. If your predicted IB results are 42/43, you did well on the TSA and your personal statement and references are ok then I imagine you would get an interview. Although of course they could be better your GSCE results aren't so bad (they're far from being *that* bad, 10 A's and 1 a* is nothing to sniff at!) that they would cancel out a good performance on the other criteria. Please note that you really do need to do well at the TSA if you want to get an interview, you won't get one on the basis of a predicted 42/43 on it's own (and that is true regardless of your GSCE results).   

Also keep in mind that the admissions tutors have contextual information about your school as well as just your results. You say that the other Oxbridge applicants at your school got at least 8 A*s but how well did the school do overall? Were your results above or below average? The admissions tutors will have that information and take it into account. Again though it's not a total disaster if your contextualised results aren't that amazing for just the GSCEs, though it's always good to be on the above average side of the equation!

On a personal note: it really annoys me (and I know I'm not the only one that feels this way) when schools discourage their pupils from applying the Oxbridge - we have a much better idea what we want than schools do so let us decide who we get!

Band 1: £18 includes an examination, diagnosis and advice. If necessary, it also includes X-rays, a scale and polish and planning for further treatment. 

Band 2: £49 includes all treatment covered by Band 1, plus additional treatment, such as fillings, root canal treatment and removing teeth (extractions). 

Band 3: £214 includes all treatment covered by Bands 1 and 2, plus more complex procedures, such as crowns, dentures and bridges.

What if I need more treatment?

If, within two months of completing a course of treatment, you need more treatment from the same charge band or a lower one, for example another filling, you don't have to pay anything extra.
However, after two months, you will have to pay an additional band charge.

So again you have to pay a maximum of £214 if you need a crown or something complex. And that is only if you are able to pay.

Prescriptions: Again you obviously didn't read the rules I sent. If you are on 20 pills and you have to pay prescription charges here are your options: 
The current prescription charge is £7.85 (£15.70 per pair of elastic hosiery). 

A three monthly PPC is £29.10. This saves you money if you need four or more items in three months.

A 12 month certificate is £104.00 and saves money if 14 or more items are needed in 12 months.

You can pay £104 per year and get all the medication you need. You'll never have to pay more than that.

&gt;Mkhitaryan allegedly agreed with Liverpool
Borussia Dortmund has apparently drawn the short straw in wooing Henrikh Mkhitaryan. According to British media, the Armenians has agreed with Liverpool for a change. In the room are around 27 million euros transfer fee.

&gt;The attacking midfielder of Shakhtar Donetsk was for weeks in the sights of black and yellow.

&gt;**Seven million difference**

&gt;Until recently Donetsk but had insisted on a transfer fee of 30 million euros, the BVB apparently was not willing to pay. 23 million euros to Dortmund have offered the Ukrainians instead.
""I have been told that Borussia came an offer in the amount of $ 30 million Our position -.. 30 million euros This is the only offer that there was,"" said General Director Sergey Galkin Schachtjors recently in an interview with the Ukrainian website "" Football.ua "".

&gt;Mkhitaryan was planned in Dortmund as a replacement for its lost Mario Gotze to Bayern Munich. During the last season he scored 25 goals in 29 top-flight appearances for Donetsk.

&gt;Two days ago, his coach Mircea Lucescu had not recommended a transfer to Liverpool. ""It's his decision, but he can still change his mind, because I believe that a move to Liverpool would be a mistake.""

The problem is if you don't pay your credit rating goes down so you can't get a loan to buy a house or a car without huge amounts of savings. These people then can't get out of poverty because their credit rating is so low. It keeps people in poverty.

If you can't be bothered to click then here is one of the stories from the comments. 
&gt;""My worksite offered health insurance with a $2500 deductible in 2011. They cancelled the insurance altogether the second half of '11 because they couldn't afford the high premiums.

&gt;They obtained insurance again in January 2012, with a $5000 deductible and pleas to employees that more of us needed to join if we were to keep it. Many employees figured why bother as a $2,500 or $5,000 deductible means you virtually have no health insurance. 

&gt;Even with such major deductibles, and your employer contributing toward your premium, you still have to pay upwards of nearly $100 or more per paycheck to participate! And that's if you're single. Who knows what families are being asked to pay for work health insurance premiums!!

&gt;And here's an even bigger kicker: Hospitals will reduce their super high bills somewhat, but guess who benefits?!? The insurance companies!! The hospital I had to use last year, charged me a whopping $3400 for a 2 hr ER visit!! I received no meds at all, getting only a saline drip to bring my blood pressure up to normal after a bout of either food poisoning or heat stroke/exhaustion (during Houston's severe heat wave last summer). That was it and the bill was $3400!!

&gt;Well, the hospital reduced the bill to $1700, but since that amount was within my $2500 deductible, I had to pay it all!! The insurance company paid, now get this, $27!!! That must have been to cover the hospital mailing expense to bill me.""

&gt;NHS costs me more in tax then any private health care plan I have ever had.

The reason that the private health care plans are relatively cheap is that these can happen.  They rely on the NHS to do the less profitable stuff for them - inpatient stays, especially medical ones, are huge money drains compared to outpatients and procedural parts of medicine (i.e. surgery, OGD scoping).  Some things are never going to be profitable, but remain essential - like looking after the 85 year old who has just had a stroke.  There is a big gulf in what playing for the NHS gets you and society as a whole, compared to what a private hospitals can offer.  

A couple of anectdotes from my time as a medical student:

GP rotation - Many patients coming back from private surgery - the surgeons have asked the GP and NHS to arrange and provide wound aftercare, community and psycosocial support (i.e. stoma nurses).  This is something that an NHS hospital team usually sets up and organises before discharge, but instead, the private sector fob it back off to the NHS, when clearly it should be their responsibility to look after the patient.

A&amp;E - Patient in a private hospital has op, crashes post-op, private hospital doesn't have suitable facilities or specially trained nurses - answer? Ship them off to the local A&amp;E.

There is a market of people who use cannabis even though it is illegal the majority of these people are everyday people, not seedy criminals and the like. (judging by people i know who use it, Not exactly very useful but all i have to go on) They pay out of the economy where they earn money to organised criminals, if something ceases to be illegal than the organised criminals move away because it becomes less profitable as more people are willing to grow it if it isn't illegal. 

Lack of danger of arrest = removed


Growers willing to grow = increased 


Profit margin for Organised criminals = decreases 


You say the prohibition never happened in this country, this is true but that doesn't mean it becomes a useless and irrelevant as an example of how organised crime takes advantage of popular products that are illegal. Once the illegality of the product is removed this ceases to be a problem. 


Another problem is that users of the illegal drug will not tell the police if the farm is owned and run with illegal immigrants by organised crime as it will incriminate them. I couldn't give a shit about cannabis but i can see that the time wasted by police, extra electricity payed by us and criminalisation of a drug that doesn't seem to have effects more negative then that already available, hurts us all.

&gt;What do you think of the rumored fee for these two?

The rumoured number is £17m (20m euro), that is outrageously high for a youth player. Granted Tin is probably in the region of £2m-£4m that means spurs are willing to part with more coin on Halilovic then they did on players like Lloris and Vertonghen. When you look at it like that, it is a huge fee and very uncharacteristic.

&gt;If we were to sign them, do you think we should do so with the plan of sending them back to Zagreb on loan for a few months to a year?

Not really up to us. The players aren't even 18 and so getting Visa's will be tough, especially for Tin who is not yet a full Croatian international (if memory serves). Tin also posted on his facebook that he didn't want to leave Zagreb and nobody asked him about a move, so he would probably jump at the chance to stay there on loan.

Midfield/CB are probably safe anyway at the moment.

&gt;Do you think this signing would get in the way of a potential striker?

Nope, Levy isn't that dumb. What it can do is show prospective strikers what spurs intentions are. We are buying the top youth talent, holding onto our prized assets and bringing in tried and true internationals. The club looks like a better prospect now in comparison to 1 month ago when all the papers where printing Bale out.

&gt;Would you rather sign two strikers (Villa/Soldado/Gomez/Osvaldo) or one striker and these two?

I rate Halilovic very highly, so I will likely be in the minority who says they want the young guys (plus, like I mentioned, I love the youth squad). Currently I would say spurs have the best youth team in England and with these two would have some of the best youth coming through the ranks in all of Europe (clubs like Barca and Ajax are really far ahead).

true,Quazz,capaldi,Capaldi,"Not really, he could easily be a future Doctor that the Doctor acquired foreknowledge on. 

In either case, the events would have already passed from John Hurt's perspective, which in turn leads to 11 saying that he broke the promise. Yes, he did, he already did that in John Hurt's past. 

It's not like Moffat has never tried a play on words before. It's pretty much his thing. 

He chooses wording like these carefully to make sure it's ambiguous enough that it could mean a great many things. 

The Time War actually doesn't fit that well into this narrative, though. Unless there is a lot of information surrounding it that we haven't been told yet (such as the Doctor could have saved the Timelords somehow). But none of those things would even make sense given what we know from the End of Time. It was very clear that the universe would end if either the Timelords or the Daleks were allowed to live any longer. They had to be stopped and neither would listen to reason. This does not seem ""unDoctorish"" to me. It's not like he hasn't committed genocide before to save the rest of the Universe. Hell, he has done it to save Earth alone (Racnoss). 

What Hurt did was something so horrible he doesn't deserve the name of the Doctor. So either it's about something he did during the Time War which is entirely possible, I agree, but ending it at the very least. 

It's possible he did something like the Protoss of Mass Effect, where he would sacrifice planets just to slow the Daleks down. That would certainly fit the picture. 

However, I personally believe it has to do with Trenzalore and his ""final battle"". John Hurt, in the timestream was seen on Trenzalore. All of 11's arc has been leading up to Trenzalore. 

The desktop theme of the TARDIS tomb was the current one as well, which is significant as it means he'll end up there soon. 

I also believe there was foreshadowing in the Name of the Doctor with River's false tomb. I'm sure the Doctor will facilitate a false tomb for himself. This would explain how someone was able to put the Doctor's name as the key to the tomb itself. (River is dead, it's unsure if Clara knows and even if she did she wouldn't be able to construct the doorway) It also fits with Moffat's writing style. He loves the effect -&gt; cause kind of writing that's possible in timetravel. Not to mention we only saw 12 incarnations in there. Nothing more. It's obvious why that is from a real world perspective, but from an in-show perspective it means there are only 12 to be found. Which means that either Doctor Who will end soon forever or it's only part of his timeline. Maybe he'll be reborn in a different manner? Genetic looms perhaps? Not only will this solve the 13 regenerations issue, people would also take less offense to it if after that he'd be a woman, which is an idea Moffat has been playing with. 

Also, they talked about a trinity earlier on in some interview. It would make a lot more sense if it was past, present, future, rather than past past present. ",0,1373034708,null,0,false,0,cawen0z,t3_1hnldl,t1_cawen0z,t1_caw7a79,null,1430575942,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0

Get two folders, in the front put all your paperwork for anything you spend money on, in the back all the paperwork relating to sales you make (make sure it's all in order of date.) Then create an invoice template in word/libraoffice/whatever (your details, space to put details of what you are providing, cost, terms of payment). Now create a receipt for payments received to send whenever you get paid. 

I'm assuming you're only going to be making a few sales per week in comparison to something like a shop so there's no need for accounting software. You can put everything into a spreadsheet and get your figures required for tax off that. 

Regarding tax, this will depend on how much you make. First you need to register as selfemployed (do it over the phone at least 3 months from the end of the month you start work, so if you start this month then you have til the end of October to register). They will automatically send you a self assessment form every year so that's where you put your earnings (anything you earn minus everything bought for the business). Your tax will be calculated and you pay it all in one go for the tax year so make sure you put aside enough during the year to cover it.

You can opt to pay the basic NI every month (best option) or twice a year by direct debit. This is class 2 NI that everyone pays. If your earning are over about 7K then you'll get charged for class 4 NI too. This is calculated at the time you do self assessment as it depends on your earnings for that tax year, so again make sure you put aside enough money to cover this.

You don't have to worry about VAT until your turnover reaches just under £80k (check how to work out your turnover, it's not just the amount you take). So when you invoice clients you don't put £xx + vat unless you are vat registered.

So long as you record payments in &amp; payments out then that's 90% of the work done. The other 10% is working out how much to put aside for tax and NI.

No there are no good links because, honestly, it's very straightforward. You can take money out for yourself at any time but record it as drawings. Don't include this in the figure for money going out as it's not a business expense. You don't have a wage slip when you're self employed.

edit: forgot to add, probably your biggest headache will be getting payments. Decide how to take them NOW and don't deviate. E.g. deposit up front, how you will take payment and what you will do when someone doesn't pay up (have a fixed date for final payment).

You might tend to see youtube videos of them trying to evade legal consequences, but these guys didn't just turn to the freeman ""movement"" that day - they had presumably felt for a long time that the state should have no authority over them.

I think the whole idea of making legal claims against the Magna Carta is totally ridiculous myself - it seems like you're accepting the queen has the right to authority over you, when you'd be better off arguing the very opposite - but I don't think that debt evasion is the most important aspect of freemen-on-the-land.

Window watch

Evidence that Chelsea’s under José Mourinho are reshaping of their squad continued last night with Demba Ba holding talks with Anzhi Makhachkala. The striker could be followed out of Stamford Bridge by John Obi Mikel after the club agreed a deal to sign Marco van Ginkel, the Holland Under-21 midfielder.

Ba rejected a move to West Ham United, his former club, and was being considered by West Bromwich Albion, but the West Midlands club signed Nicolas Anelka, the former Chelsea favourite, on a one-year deal yesterday.

Mikel is wanted by Galatasaray, while Van Ginkel, 20, will cost about £8 million from Vitesse Arnhem. He will become Mourinho’s second signing after the arrival of André Schürrle from Bayer Leverkusen. Gaël Kakuta, the midfielder, is expected to move in the opposite direction to spend a second season on loan at Vitesse.

Decent bets

Mathew Upson is in talks about a move to Queens Park Rangers after being released by Stoke City. The defender was on loan at Brighton &amp; Hove Albion last season. QPR say that they are not interested in Scott Parker, the Tottenham Hotspur midfielder.

Tottenham and Everton are interested in Gerard Deulofeu, the 19-year-old Barcelona winger. Fulham believe they can secure the services of Junior Malanda for £3 million, with the midfielder in dispute with Zulte Waregem, the Belgian club.

Everton still expect to sign Arouna Koné despite a late bid by Newcastle United for the Wigan Athletic forward. Koné favours a move to Everton, who were close to finalising a £6.5 million deal before Newcastle’s intervention. Newcastle have been unwilling to match Aston Villa’s price for Darren Bent, the forward.

Wigan hope to sign Andre Wisdom on a loan deal, but the move is reliant on Martin Kelly proving his fitness at Liverpool after a cruciate knee ligament injury. Brendan Rodgers sees the benefit of Wisdom, the defender, gaining experience elsewhere.

Sunderland have agreed a deal with Panathinaikos for Charis Mavrias, the 19-year-old midfielder. Matej Vydra, the Udinese striker, could return on loan at Watford next season after scoring 22 times for the club last term.

Dead certs

Norwich City have finalised the transfer of Nathan Redmond, the 19-year-old England Under-21 winger, from Birmingham City for an undisclosed fee.

Francis Coquelin, the midfielder, has moved on loan from Arsenal to Freiburg in Germany. Wigan have agreed a deal to sign Scott Carson, the former England goalkeeper, from Bursaspor.

Long shots

Roma officials are trying to sell Pablo Osvaldo, the Italy striker, to Manchester City or Tottenham.

Eintracht Frankfurt claim that Nicklas Bendtner’s wage demands could scupper a deal with Arsenal. The forward earns about £2 million a year compared with the £1.2 million that the German club are prepared to pay.

&gt;The truth is, the 13 colonies would never have earned their freedom without French intervention -- the whole battle for American independence was essentially [a proxy war](http://books.google.fi/books?id=WdKUoL7Z4nIC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=french+alliance+american+revolution&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qI9DUdqYF4fmqwGTx4HQDg&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=french%20alliance%20american%20revolution&amp;f=false) between Britain and France. To the French, America was nothing but [another theater in their grand blood feud](http://books.google.fi/books?id=xK1NuzpAcH8C&amp;pg=PA321&amp;dq=british+motivation+american+revolution&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uazfUNXNJafbiwKEhYGoBw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=british%20motivation%20american%20revolution&amp;f=false) against Britain. They were all about making the Englishmen eat every last available dick, and since they noticed they could use the colonists' struggle for independence as a handy feeding pen, that's exactly what they did.

&gt;France began [providing arms and ammunition as early as 1776](http://books.google.com/books?id=q5ZXIRScV6gC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;lpg=PA159&amp;dq=france+1777+25,000+uniforms&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Nn1yPsKjxT&amp;sig=J9_hZkM0FJyVFaJn9ytF9jDwlTA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RJBDUfz1Os31rAHIjIG4DQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=france%201777%2025%2C000%20uniforms&amp;f=false) (the war started in 1775). In early 1777, months before Saratoga, the French sent American colonists 25,000 uniforms and pairs of boots, hundreds of cannons, and thousands of muskets -- all stuff that the colonists would've had a hard time surviving without, and all stuff they had no access to on their own. And that was just the tip of the iceberg: From supplies [to advice](http://books.google.fi/books?id=lyjjEsqlqo0C&amp;pg=PA504&amp;dq=rochambeau+and+the+virginia+campaign&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yavfUPKEEqaniQLRpYHgBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=rochambeau%20and%20the%20vi&amp;f=false) to military reinforcements, France exercised all the fiscal restraint of a drunk businessman at a strip club when it came to funding the American war.

&gt;France provided a whopping 90 percent of the rebels' gunpowder. Let that sink in for a second. Without France, the entire American Revolution would have devolved into a bunch of dudes swinging their muskets as clubs within weeks.

In every other way other than performance on the pitch Liverpool are larger than Dortmund. 

Were Mkhitaryan to sign for Dortmund I don't think it would be because they beat Liverpool's offer.

I hate to break it to you, but in 99% of cases players pick the larger wage than any other factor. This increasingly means that the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th etc. largest clubs in England are paying players more than top teams in other Euro leagues and players are coming here. For eg. Paulinho to Spurs.

*edit* to add, arguing about which club is 'bigger' is stupid since you aren't setting parameters to the argument or definitions. you talking about larger financially? larger fan base? better ability to attract star players? or results on the pitch? Liverpool is larger than Dortmund, much larger, in fact, in every category other than results (which usually matters the least for players - for eg.

In terms of fanbase, various studies have shown that Liverpool remain within the top ten supported teams in the world, with Dortmund either not figuring at all, or featuring far lower down ([1](http://hamrofootball.com/2013/04/27/top-10-most-popular-football-clubs-in-world-football/), [2](http://www.goal.com/en/news/1717/editorial/2012/12/31/3562991/the-20-most-popular-european-clubs-on-goalcom), [3](http://www.talksport.co.uk/magazine/big-picture/2011-10-13/worlds-most-popular-football-club-revealed-man-united-liverpool-arsenal-barca-real-or-chelsea?p=6)).

With regards recent performances, let's not forget that just 3 years ago we were regular CL qualifiers, just 6 years ago we were in the final, and just 2 years before that we won the thing. These days though, the media driven perception of football is that it's all about the moment, history is nothing in the purely results driven modern football landscape. Even very recent history. Realistically though, fans don't forget as quickly as all that, and huge clubs that were once very successful can remain giants of the football world for a long time after success has eluded them. Liverpool FC *are* a larger club than Borussia Dortmund, by any metric. Recent results are not an indicator of the size of a club.

What happens when the monied classes have all the luxuries they need thus require no more work done? Unemployment. There are sections of this country and the world who are locked into a lifestyle of banal drudgery purely because the money system forces them into debt that they can never escape.

Actually he was pretty close to doing Daniel Craig's Bond before Daniel Craig. He wanted to do Bond more like the books, but he was directed to play him otherwise. He wanted far more realism, more grit. A darker and somewhat more violent Bond. 

The scripts for his films were pretty lousy and they made a major mistake with trying to make Bond PC correct way too fast. He didn't like it but he did what he was contracted to do. But Dalton himself he was a damn fine Bond, IMHO, and I was very sad that he didn't come back and make the 3rd Bond film he was contracted to do, that his contract was allowed to lapse before they straightened out the legal mess that the franchise was in. 

Nothing against Brosnan or Craig but I would have liked to have seen more of his Bond actually preferably in a Bond film with a decent script. I think had he been given a good one he'd have been more liked and around a lot longer. What they are doing now is exactly what he was struggling to get them to do at the time and he deserves credit for that. For trying to get them to go there. I don't think it was Dalton that was the problem. I think it was the material and the direction the franchise was going in. 

For the record he is my favorite Bond, the weakness of the films he was in notwithstanding. I like them all, except Moore maybe.

What's it to you how someone gives birth? As a woman, I don't. It's a personal choice and one that nearly all women make after a good deal of thought and soul searching, more so these days when you've got a million and one bastards who all think that anyone that dares do it differently to them is a horrible human being.

The A level was ridiculous because they claimed it would give us an AS level qualification but no universities recognised it, and it was a waste of time. We weren't allowed to get involved with Red Nose Day because it gave contraception to Africa.

The worst thing about it was crappy (read non-existent) sex education. I had to be taught by a girlfriend how to put a condom on. There were lots of teen pregnancies as well. Oh, and I also remember being told that there was a job surplus, and the number of vacant jobs was exactly equal to the number of abortions.

But it wasn't too bad. The thing to note however was I was late entry into the school because I moved from somewhere else. I got straight in 2 weeks into the school year because my parents were Catholic, even though it was oversubscribed as it was the best school in the area. That doesn't really seem fair to me.

Buy: Reus (30), Navas (17), Shaw (12-15?), Lukaku (22), Caulker (15), Thiago (20). Total (119).

Yes, I think I MIGHT have gone a bit over board on my forward line, however I think it will still work. Thiago + Rodwell in the middle. (Long term aim. Yaya will be in the first team for another year or 2.) Reus / Silva / Navas from left to right, behind Aguero. Though I'm slightly sad that I've pretty much pushed Dzeko to 3rd choice striker, as I think Lukaku will be better than Dzeko in every way. 

Defensively I highly rate Caulker, and he's an English lad as well (which will probably bump his value up), And I think he'll be a great understudy to Kompany, and once Kompany retires (and stays on a coach *fingers crossed*), Caulker + Nastasic will be a fantastic defensive pairing for years. 

And Luke Shaw is a great young left back, and will learn a lot from Clichy while training at City, but I'd hope to put him out on loan, probably straight back to Southampton for a season if they can guarantee games.

I think most of these signings are quite reasonable and possible, except for perhaps Reus, where I might have to pay more than 30 mil.

Keep a set of accounts, don't need to be too complicated - HMRC run workshops quite frequently throughout the country or you can employ the services of a book-keeper.

Every 6 months you'll be sent a bill for Class 2 NIC. Every year you will be sent a self assessment form which you can fill in or do online. You'll then be given a bill for any tax due plus any Class 4 NIC. If your turnover is below £70,000 the self assessment is literally total money in, total tax deductible money out, profit/loss - no need to break expenses down by category.

If you make enough profit to pay tax on your first year 2013-2014 you'll have to pay 150% of the tax bill by 31/1/2015 and another 50% of the 2013-2014 amount by July 31st 2015. That amount will be deducted from any due for the 2014-15 tax year. If you don't make enough to pay tax in 2013-2014 you won't need to pay any on account for the following tax year.

I'm convinced that neither Cameron, Clegg or Miliband are actually keen on an EU referrendum. Cameron was only forced into it to calm his own backbenches and to be seen to confront the *'UKIP-problem'*. Despite his recent rhetoric, deep down Cameron seems to be a fairly pro-EU tory and historically has been.

Based on how things are shaping up, the EU may very well be one of the key differentiating features at the next election... This is especially true considering it was the elephant in the room at the last election where many people (on both sides of the debate) felt their voices weren't being heard. Plus polls have consistently shown that a majority of people do actually support a referrendum, regardless of their inclination towards the EU.

A pro-austerity, anti-referrendum Labour party is going to REALLY struggle to differentiate itself against the conservatives - which is incredible really when you consider the conservatives have done virtually nothing to encourage their re-election. Indeed if they couldn't get a majority in 2010, it seems extraordinary that they will even come close in 2015.

**Tl:dr; All Miliband has to do is offer an EU referrendum and denounce austerity and he's pratically garunteed to win the next election! - yet he won't do it?**. He could then easily weasel out of both later like all politicians do - E.g.

**Forwards in top 3:** Mata, Hazard, De Bruyne , Moses , Schurrle, Torres?, Ba?, Lukaku.



**7 players to rotate for top 3.** With all the games we will have this season that sounds like a good amount. (7 because either Torres or Ba will most likely be sold)

**6 players in the central 3 available for rotation.** Lampard is aging so he will probably play less minutes. Essien is injury prone so might have to watch out for that. That leaves 4 good aged and healthy players for 3 roles, if we bring in some of the youngsters we should have a good amount of players to rotate around.

I did not include Piazon, Oriol Romeu and others because most look like they will be loaned.

EDIT: 

1. For those saying Oscar should be in the forward 3 I disagree, he has played numerous games in a 4-3-3 for Brazil and has looked great and I dont think he is suited for the wings.

2. Mata playing in the wings we all know isn't the best way to utilize him but if he is paired on the RW with a RCM who has the legs to overlap him (Ramires) in combination with an attacking RB (Azpilicueta) this will allow Mata to tuck in practically making him the playmaker in the center.

Its basically a 4-3-3 and 4-2-3-1 hybrid that revolves around constant rotation like what RDM implemented except its more then just the front 3 rotating around, it includes one of the Central midfielders.

true,davegod,uk,United Kingdom,"When you register for self-employment usually HMRC send you a letter to set up a direct debit instruction to pay your class 2 NIC (if not should be on their website somewhere). This is a monthly flat rate of about £10/m. There is an abiity to opt-out if you are confident your profit will be under £5,700 or so though you could get stung a bit if you do better than expected. 

Also, you will need to complete a self assessment tax return each year. The return is for the year to 5th April however it is OK to calculate your business profit to 31 March. The return will be due by 31 January the following year if you submit online however may be better for you to do by 31 October so that HMRC can do the final sums for you.

HMRC should eventually send you a notice to submit the tax return likely it will arrive around 6th April... This return will support calculation of your income tax and class 4 NIC, which are based on the level of your profits. 

The taxes payment would also be due on 31 January. You may well also have to make a ""payment on account"" by the following 31 July which will assume you will be due to pay a similar level of tax next year (remember that 31 January is 10 months after 5th April and 31 July is 4 months so not really ""in advance""). The thing to take away is that you might find the cash payment to be higher than anticipated. Furthermore there are rules on commencement of trading which may result in an ""overlap"" which is difficult to explain but is another reason the cash payment may be higher than anticipated.

An accountant will sort all this out for you - for a fee. Most will waive the initial consultation and forms etc if you approach it right, and just charge you for the annual accounts &amp; tax return. The accountant is there for advice, keep you straight and save you some bother with the administration. Agree a fee in advance, either completely fixed or require that they inform you in advance if it will go over. Go to a couple of local firms and get a quote. Preferably get a recommendation from anyone you know who has a business. 

Of course you could do it yourself. There is the basic tax return plus the self-employment pages to be done, though there is the SA103 short version if you get less than £77,000 in fees and it is not so painful.

Regardless of whether you go it alone or take on an accountant, I recommend that you maintain clear records. Maintain a folder with one section for business bank statements, another for sales invoices and another for expenditure. Have a folder for each year to 31 March and beware you'll need to keep it for 6 years (technically five years after the relevant 31 January tax return deadline, so basically 6 years). 

Note the new ""simplified"" option for cash expenses and cash basis may be of interest to you, see https://www.gov.uk/simpler-income-tax-simplified-expenses

Maybe you can get your hands on some cheap software however a basic spreadsheet which keeps track of income &amp; expenditure is likely to be fine.  The income figures would be positive and the expenditure items negative, so you can add it all up and reconcile to the balance on your business bank statement (yes, open a separate account for only business transactions). The columns might be:

- date
- description
- reference number (e.g. cheque number, a cross-reference to the invoice etc)
- total received/(paid) via bank
- total received/(paid) personally (e.g. own cash in hand, basically keeping a balance of a ""loan"" between you personally and your business)

then analysis columns to classify the nature of the transaction:

- fee income
- bank interest income
- other business income
- materials and other direct costs
- motor and travel expenses (bus fares etc, also car costs but this is complicated, likely to be best to pay car costs personally and claim using the [mileage scheme](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/incometax/relief-mileage.htm))
- staffing costs
- rent, rates, heat &amp; light (unlikely to be relevant unless you have business premises)
- small repairs and renewals of small equipment (say, items &lt;£150)
- capital expenditure (equipment lasting more than a year and costing £150+)
- accountancy, legal and other professional fees
- bank charges and interest expense
- stationery and telephone costs
- miscellaneous expenses
- business entertainment (e.g. taking client to lunch, this is not allowable for tax). 
- drawings (cash withdrawn for personal use, this is not an expense and is not tax allowable, not classify as ""wages"")

Note the capital expenditure items are treated specially for tax, you will need to do separate figures and gradually claim for it over a period of time. You'll need to look this up if you decide upon doing your tax return yourself. You can claim for items you already own e.g. cameras and computer, bring in at current market value (use ebay and take a printout to support you in case HMRC start asking questions). If you use some items both for business and personally you will not be able to claim for the personal-use proportion (just apply a % you'd be happy to argue with the tax man about).  

Mind that if you work from home any expenses related to that home are personal unless you can demonstrate it is wholly business. There is a puny ""use of home as office"" allowance, you might be able to get more by looking into it, or your accountant make it easy for you.  

Be aware that if you go over £79,000 sales in any 12 month period you may need to register for and start charging VAT. This is very probably not good for you if you are selling to the public. However if you are primarily selling to business then you might want to consider choosing to register for VAT as this will allow you to reclaim the VAT paid on expenditure, though the administration is a burden and there is potential for fines if you make mistakes.  

There may also be other nuisances to consider for example:

Actually, in a way yes they were. Tax collection backed by violence and credit. Those that needed credit in really hard times put up themselves or their children/wife/stranger as a surety. When the inevitable default occurred the creditors came for the people. Colonialists went as far as enforcing bizarrely harsh laws and should the ""criminal"" not be able to pay (or **pacify**) their debtors they would be taken. They even invented Ponzi schemes masquerading as secret societies:

&gt; The most ingenious trick of the merchant societies, though, was to assist in the dissemination of a secret society, called Ekpe. Ekpe was most famous for sponsoring magnificent masquerades and for initiat­ ing its members into arcane mysteries, but it also acted as a secret mechanism for the enforcement of debts.70 In Calabar itself, for ex­ ample, the Ekpe society had access to a whole range of sanctions, starting with boycotts (all members were forbidden to conduct trade with a defaulting debtor), fines, seizure of property, arrest, and finally, execution-with the most hapless victims left tied to trees, their lower jaws removed, as a warning to others.71 It was ingenious, particularly, because such societies always allowed anyone to buy in, rising though the nine initiatory grades if they could pay the fee-these also exacted, of course, in the brass rods the merchants themselves supplied.

&gt; In other words, it was quite expensive. But membership quickly became the chief mark of honor and distinction everywhere. Entry fees were no doubt less exorbitant in small, distant communities, but the effect was still the same: thousands ended up in debt to the merchants, whether for the fees required for joining, or for the trade goods they supplied (mostly cloth and metal put to use creating the gear and costumes for the Ekpe performances-debts that they thus themselves became responsible for enforcing on themselves. These debts, too, were regularly paid in people, ostensibly yielded up as pawns.) [Debt: The First 5000 Years, p153, Graeber] 

As for war, the defeated **owe** their lives to the winners, should they be spared then a slave they be. That was the logic of battle.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"I'm nervous because Mkhitaryan is a much different style of player than Eriksen and we were after him because of his specific style and skillset.  Erisken does not have the same qualities, and thus is not an ideal candidate for what we wanted Micky to do.

Eriksen is a player who likes to be in control and create from there.  He's not the most direct player in the world and he's not explosive going forward.  Mkhitaryan really drives the attack , he's direct and powerful with wonderful movement and great finishing ability.  We wanted him because he can add a lot of goals from the midfield and make our play more direct when we need it (which is very helpful for breaking down resilient, compact sides that are good at crowding out the spaces we want to pass in).  Eriksen is basically more of what we already have with coutinho, whereas Mkhitaryan offered a new dynamic (reminiscent of a younger Stevie G actually) and a lot more flexibility as he's comfortable playing as an inside forward as well as any position through the center of midfield whereas Eriksen is really only effective in one role.

Basically missing out on Micky is not going to be appropriately covered by Eriksen because they're vastly different players.  I think that if we thought Eriksen was able to do what we're looking for we'd have been after him from the start.

Does this mean the world is ending? No.  Not at all.  But Eriksen doesn't play the way Micky does and so far we've clearly been thinking that we need a player like Micky, not a player like Eriksen (Coutinho fills that role very well already but also offers more diversity).",0,1373048959,null,0,false,0,cawj9rt,t3_1hp00t,t1_cawj9rt,t1_cawh840,null,1430573687,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

There is nobody that doesn't want that long term; but the lights are going to go out.  Uranium will run out, true, as will oil, coal and gas.  That is no reason to not use them while we search for something else.  Building wind turbines (which at best have a life time of 25 years, incidentally) that cause us to use up those finite resources _faster_ is madness.

I never said anything about replacing oil/coal/gas.  But for new stations, the options are very limited, and nuclear is the big one.  Further, _you've_ completely ignore thorium reactors, which are better on almost every metric than uranium.  The only reason we never pursued them as an option was because you can't get weapons grade material out of them.  Thorium, incidentally, would last a lot longer than 10 years.

&gt; And of course you're completely ignoring something called grid storage.

""ignored"" in what sense?  Grid storage is just the name for storage.  It's got it's place of course (some of my other comments have talked about PSH in this thread) but it's for smoothing variations, not for energy generation, and certainly not for periods longer than a few hours.

My brother was expelled after a fight in which the bully who started it claimed that my brother had been blaspheming and that's why said bully just had to hurt him . This was considered an entirely acceptable reason. 


In college i was told by the deputy head that i wasn't a real woman as I cannot have children. My refusal to worship lead to a permanent mark on my record that nearly got my Oxford application rejected-though thanks to a local mp that knew the problem i was accepted. They made it sound as though i was a delinquent because I stood up for my right not to worship their imaginary friend. 


I studied religious studies at both gcse and A level. In all that time we spent 3 weeks on Judaism and 2 on Islam. Everything i know about those religions and others, is from self study.  Of my 7+ years of education in religious schools all i ever learnt was how much I hate Christians for never standing up and saying ""this is wrong"".

Australian wine does tend to be fruitier because they use stainless steel barrels.

&gt; Stainless steel is another popular choice for fermentation. Used more often in Australia and New Zealand, this preserves the fruit characteristics of the wine and creates what many call a “fruit forward” wine. In these wines, we may feel slighted by the minimized tannins and lack of barrel spices, but these wines exude a more true expression of the grape.

true,Brodiaq,null,null,"I don't think he can lead a line, not reliably at least. I agree last year on the whole, had he been played upfront we might have had a little better season in front of goal, but that is really only because of Ade's horrendous form, barring the last month or so, and Defoe's complete 180 from hot to cold. As has been said, Dempsey doesn't have the physical tools to be a solitary striker upfront, which is what we needed for the most part last year in the 4-2-3-1. I think Dempsey could pull emergency duty, and maybe even be a solid rotational choice against some weaker sides up front. 

Personally though, I think he could work well as a secondary striker, Dempsey's best trait is his ability to see how the play will unfold and where exactly he needs to be. He's a decent finisher, and better at creating than most give him credit for around here. Putting him in as a secondary striker gives him the best chance of seeing things, and getting solid attempts on target.

Their managerial appointments were pretty good. Dalglish was the man everyone was calling for, and although it didn't work out in the end I don't think FSG can be criticised for that. Rodgers looks to be setting out a clear vision for the club which is promising, though it is still early days.

In the transfer market they have given us a fair amount of money, in fact quite a bit more money than I would have expected. Sadly much of that money was squandered because of the disastrous appointment of Damien Comolli as Director of Football, but they have learnt from their mistakes and look to have established what looks to be an effective transfer committee, along with a strong scouting network, though again it is too early to really judge how this will fare.

Overall I like them. The only area we can judge them on is off the pitch matters, and apart from the appointment of Comolli and the handling of the Suarez saga I can't think of many things they have done that can be criticised.

- Still mostly funded by *central* government but independent of *local* government control. Private business, charities etc can provide some of the funding.

- Must meet the same National Curriculum requirement as every other school. **However**, they can set how the delivery of the curriculum occurs. For example you could put more emphasis on certain subjects or the 'delivery' of the subjects. For me that amounts to choosing what content you 'deliver' or not but that's a debate for another day. 

- Length of terms and school days are flexible. 

- Staff pay and conditions are set by the school.

- Sponsors are held responsible for improving the performance of the school. 

Note: The official website, listed below, has an additional grammatical/word mistake that I find ironic considering it is the government website for education: *'Sponsors are held accountable for the improving the performance of their schools'.* 

- More freedom of how they control their budget.

- Academies are required to have at least 2 parent governors. I assume regular schools do not? When I was at school there were always a couple of parent governors anyway.

- Admission legislation still the same as regular schools. Same applies for Freedom of Information Act, Selection and Cooperation with the community.

Its very clever, you can snap receipts and attach them to expenses and can hook it up to your bank account to track everything. It also has a self assessment section which gives you the totals to fill in. 

It was really useful in the early days when I was doing invoices here and there but now that I am working practically full time I am going to make the jump to LTD and get a proper accountant. I'll still use the software though as its useful for invoicing and I like being able to track everything rather than use excel. 

And as for LTD over being freelance, I read that until you earn over £22k the additional expense of being an LTD and paperwork involved is just not worth it. Plus there are additional risks and responsibilities involved in being an LTD, such as you have to keep up to date accounts and file them every year with companies house, if you don't or you make a mistake you risk being blacklisted from being a company director for something like five years. 

So, I registered as self-employed so I could concentrate all my energy and money into building up my business first and now its working out and I feel confident that this is what I want to do, I am making the jump into LTD.

Also have a look at UK business forums, theres lots of very knowledgeable people on there from everything from finance through to marketing. Plus you might be able to pick up some work through it!

They would've had to pay something like £20000 for three months worth, but didn't so it means Sky customers can't access 3D Wimbledon unless they switch over to the freeview mode on their tvs. Sky currently has the largest 3D audience in the uk with about 500,000 connected TVs capable of viewing 3D.

You know, my mum took me to an LS Lowry exhibition when I was around 10 or so, and my mum was saying how he was the biggest artist to have come out of Manchester so I was really excited (and this was pre-internet so I had no idea what to expect).  I felt so let down that Manchester's most successful artist pretty much did shitty stick-figures.

Anyway, years later in my second pop at getting a degree there was a voluntary lecture being held about Lowry that was supposed to be for out-of-towners to appreciate a bit of the local history.  Students being students, and me being a ""mature student"" I was one of only about 5 people that showed up, but I'm so glad I did.

As far as Peter Davison, Caves of Androzani is just a REALLY good script. The dialogue might be hokey to some and it's definitely structure with a formula, but it's SO tightly done and it's paced well, and the whole changing power structure from scene to scene is like watching a mini-epic.

I agree that the church shouldn't have a hand in education, but I wouldn't go so far as to call it indoctrination, I feel its a bit like calling a creepy look rape. Weakens the term.

The other thing you shouldn't forget is that in the UK where the church and the state have been linked through the monarch, and christianity is considered default, has a lower proportion of fanatic fundamentalists thank the US where the state is historically secular.

All he ever wanted was regular playing time, like any reasonable striker, hence his bad times at City. He wasn't an issue at Arse besides wanting out of that hell hole, and at Togo, he's a national hero.

Since the bus shooting, Ade has been paying for half the team to survive, including the goal keeper who lost control of his legs, IIRC.

The ""issue"" you claim that he had with Togo on national duty was perfectly reasonable on his part. The president of Togo wanted to congratulate the team personally for their representation at the ACON, but they couldn't afford to fly them there, so Ade got his plane for the team to all travel back to their country to inspire the people... which any reasonable human being would do. It was pretty disgraceful that he was attacked for it by the club.

Mancini has a history of problems with all sorts of players... Tevez, Balotelli, Ade too, to a certain extent. Albeit these are big personalities but Mancini dealt with them terribly.

That's all Ade is, a big personality. That's why he got a red card after scoring for us in the NLD, doing all he could to get the ball back for us, because he freakin loathes arse.

Police shouldn't shoot unless there is a clear and present danger to themselves or others. The case has highlighted that there was no justification for the officer to fire once, let alone eight times. The officer says they believed he was reaching for a sub-machine gun, but reconstruction proved this to be impossible for them to determine. As such, the officer should not have fired.

Unlawful killing is just that. If the CPS decides to charge the officer or MPS, then they would have to have sufficient evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt that their actions were not justified. They probably won't be able to.
