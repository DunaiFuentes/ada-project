So ofc May is going to try and legitimise it at any chance she gets. I think the hope was to have it legal long before word of it ever got out and they could pretend it was all within the writing of the law.

To me this mass snooping is a massive overreach of power, when you look at it in raw terms its a small group of people giving themselves access to huge amounts of information about other people, the only justification they have is that they call themselves an elected government, if your neighbour wanted to know every detail of your life you would tell him to mind his own business, just because these people work in government and are paid to manage the country does not give them the right to place every aspect of every persons life under a microscope fishing for information

Dig hard enough and everyone has things in their life they would be embarrassed about, perhaps ashamed of or that might compromise their current personal or work relationships. it doesn't matter if you had an affair 10 years ago, realised your mistake, repented, became a better person and moved on, that knowledge might still destroy your marriage and split you from your kids if it were revealed today, its like them having the ability to unilaterally flatten you but you don't have anything to fire back, there's no cold war, no defence against it because you would never get the same visibility of their information and are they any better, if you looked would they be whiter than white? We know for a fact that power attracts corruption and so politics attracts corrupt people, meaning laws like this are putting powers that can so easily be abused into the hands of those that WOULD abuse them.

I think its also clear that this snooping is going beyond just the metadata (to, from, subject, size, date) but actually including content, these are peoples private lines of communications and so the content of those communications is going to include very private things, if a husband and wife decide to share a few risqué personal photos, that is between a man and his wife, to intercept and record those communications would be nothing short of perverted",0,1371957703,null,0,false,0,caodu6s,t3_1gv5sr,t1_caodu6s,t3_1gv5sr,null,1430715284,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

true,TheRoyalTenenThom,NL,netherlands,"Agreed. My brother asked me today if I were a diehard Madrid fan who would I rather have, Gareth Bale or Neymar?

true,Beleza,lfc12,,"Before I begin let me just say that I love youth development and if I had it my way all teams would get most of their players from their youth academies. 

I think the title of this post should be ""What youngsters do you think will make it?"" because statistically very few youngsters ever make it into the first team squad. That's nothing against our academy it's true everywhere (let's not count Barcelona as the outlier). A lot of the time reserve and youth teams are built around one or two players that have larger potential than the other players who are often thrown to the wayside. It's really sad and can be really damaging but that's the way it goes. 

Second, if you look at the top 4 teams they used more experienced squads than us and utilized one youngster possibly two (ManU: Rafael, De Gea; Chelsea: Oscar, etc) within a balanced squad of middle aged and older players. Having a squad with three+ youngsters isn't going to get us closer to that forth place we all desire. Youngsters tend to be very inconsistent which has certainly been a big weakness for our squad this year. Youngsters are great for depth and eventual talent but over reliance (playing Suso as an inside forward/winger) can be detrimental to the squad. 

All of this and we tend to really overrate our academy products. 

With that said I think the following might make it: Sterling, Wisdom, McLaughlin, Suso (maybe, I'm still not 100% convinced), Ibe (should remain in Academy/reserves a few more years for development). 

I really can't see any out of the others making it. I'm not knowledgeable enough to comment on Teixera or Llyod-Jones yet. Sorry for mistakes, it's late. ",0,1371961753,null,0,false,0,caoew0g,t3_1gw0ng,t1_caoew0g,t3_1gw0ng,null,1430714788,10,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,10

true,showmethefever,flair8,,"This will be a great signing and a midfield of Sandro, Paulinho and Dembele is a force that most teams won't be able to handle. Not to mention, Dembele always has something nagging him and who knows how healthy Sandro will be. So, in a 4-2-3-1, this gives us plenty of depth. If we switch to AVB's preferred 4-3-3, then we can play those three in the midfield, running the slight risk of losing creativity. However, I don't really feel as if creativity is our problem; in my eyes, it's our finishing. 

I still trust Adebayor, but we do need another striker. My preference is David Villa or Mario Gomez (although his links have seem to gone to go cold). Neither of them are getting any younger, but both have proven themselves as consistent and clinical when it comes to finishing. A striking tandem of one of those two with Adebayor in the rotation and Defoe used as a sub should be enough.

Our creative and attacking midfielders and wingers will be Bale, Holtby, Siggy, Lennon and Dempsey. I also wouldn't be surprised if we look to bring in another player here.

Our midfield is a little crowded, so I expect us to sell two of Parker, Huddlestone and Livermore. I'd prefer to keep Huddlestone out of those three, because even though he's slow, he can pass the ball and is very useful as a sub and for rotation in cup games and against lesser teams in the league. 

I'm hoping we bring in three or four players- Paulinho, a striker, another striker or attacking player and possibly a LB. ",0,1371966214,null,0,false,0,caofyn9,t3_1gvppy,t1_caofyn9,t3_1gvppy,null,1430714283,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

true,showmethefever,flair8,,"David Villa- We don't need to avoid this transfer in the least bit. In fact, if he is at all interested, we should do the exact opposite and do everything that we can to acquire him. If his wages aren't too bad, which they probably are, there really isn't a reason to not sign him. Some players are injury prone and others suffer a one time freak injury. I guess it's a sign of our club's progress though when the fans wouldn't sign a world class striker. 

Gareth Barry- I saw a few links in the last couple of weeks, but they have cooled down and I don't think we were every really in for him. He isn't what we need though and if we were actually in for him, we'd probably just end up sticking with Parker anyways. With the Paulinho transfer looking good and Barry wanting to earn his spot at City, I'd say that there's nothing in this. 

Ibrahim Afellay- We always seem to be loosely linked to him, but I think it's usually just media speculation. If he was only £5 million, then it wouldn't be a terrible bit of business, but I always seem to hear about his injury proneness and attitude problems. 

Christian Benteke- He's far too expensive and has only had one good (okay great) year in the league. I would be shocked to see Levy even go for this. 

As for the rest of the names in the article- I've never seen us linked to them, especially recently. So, we don't need to avoid them, because we aren't even looking at them. ",0,1371967093,null,0,false,0,caog5vi,t3_1gvt0c,t1_caog5vi,t3_1gvt0c,null,1430714188,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Spots 3-5 are up for grabs between City, Arsenal and Spurs. I think City made a huge mistake in firing Mancini, but we'll see how they carry on. Arsenal will always find a way to be nagging everybody for that 4th place trophy and their fixture suggests it will be similar this year; they'll be really dangerous if they can complete that Higuain signing. We're a couple of key signings away from being really dangerous team and with AVB having a successful year here under his belt, I think we're ready for great things.

Everton will be an interesting team to watch. Moyes always did so well there, but I could see Martinez doing well as his replacement. Maybe he will get some funds.

Liverpool are still irrelevant in my opinion, but it seems like they've stopped being dumbasses with their money. Henderson, Downing and Carroll for around 75 million, if I remember correctly, is still fucking hilarious.

true,WooperSlim,null,null,"Yes, in ""An Unearthly Child"" Susan said, ""I made up the name TARDIS from the initials, Time And Relative Dimension In Space""

The next time they see another TARDIS, Vicky exclaims, ""It's a TARDIS. The Monk's got a TARDIS!""  The Monk, however only refers to it as a ""Mark 4"" or ""My Time Machine.""

The next time the Monk appears, everyone, even the Monk calls it a TARDIS.

So even from the beginning, the name wasn't unique to the Doctor's TARDIS.  I'm inclined to believe either Susan's name for the machine caught on, or she was the one to actually name them.

----
For completion, here are other times they meet other Time Lords:

The 2nd Doctor calls the machines the War Chief is using ""TARDIS travel machines"" though the War Chief calls it a ""SIDRAT"" (which is obviously TARDIS spelled backward.)  When the go to Gallifrey, the Time Lords only ever refer to the Doctor's ship, and they call it the TARDIS.

The 3rd Doctor and the Master call his ship a TARDIS too.  The Time Lords never refer to the Master's TARDIS, but they again refer to the Doctor's ship as the TARDIS.

The Sisterhood of Karn discover and refer to the Doctor's ship as a TARDIS.

When the 4th Doctor goes to Gallifrey, the Time Lords refer to his ship specifically as a Type-40 TT Capsule, or more frequently as simply a Capsule.  But they do also refer to the Doctor's ship as a TARDIS.

When the 5th Doctor is on Gallifrey, Omega and other Time Lords only use TARDIS to describe the Doctor's and Omega's ships.

The 6th Doctor, the Master, and the Rani all use TARDIS to refer to the Rani's ship.  The Valeyard (perhaps unsurprisingly) calls the Doctor's ship the TARDIS.

The Rani again calls her ship the TARDIS when speaking with the 7th Doctor.

----
I think that should about cover it.  Very rarely is a Time Lord ship called anything but a TARDIS, and even then the same people may call it a TARDIS anyway.",0,1371969673,null,0,false,0,caogp8u,t3_1gubto,t1_caogp8u,t3_1gubto,null,1430713934,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

The fact that he's been widely exposed like this, lost his job and can't work with kids for life, I think over 5 year's jail seems a little harsh.

Another reason is drivers only 'sign' a certain amount of routes, they cannot detour, this is because the railway is not standardised like roads, some signs may be on the left, or the right, on a 4 ft pole or 15 ft in the air with a semaphore and hard to see around sunset as the sun is behind it.

A few days have been a variety of media, news, forums and Facebook to read the information, which I have not even heard, but have indicated that they are a reliable source or my club and the other clubs close to their sources.

I assure you that none of these sources, and they have no chance to comment.

There are also many scripts that apply to people who for years have had a significant contribution to the development of my work, I would like to point out that Ruben Hayrapetyan is a man who has always done everything that I will come back with higher rating. I can play good football and will benefit the Ruben Hayrapetyan and my people and I will do everything that I will come back better the club and I always have a very good relationship with FFA President Ruben Hayrapetyan has nothing to do with the different news Found information.

My work deals with the transfer of my agent I as a professional football player, the club and my agent, I'm not interested in my case I have my official contract with the club and perform my duties is to take place between the clubs agreed a deal, then I only kteghekanam transaction details and I'll give my consent or not, if it's not enough for me now I'm on vacation, I am going to relax and Paris.

Russian and British media are trying to solve the problems, or that my actions are the conclusions of the days when he had to undergo medical examination that I went to, I was in at the time or saw me write the Vienna airport. I went to Austria and waiting for something, but I was leaving for Vienna, Paris and Geneva, my sister was off work.

I'm not planning any media to communicate with, because I can not comment on things of which I have no information on professional players are rules in life and I'm obliged to respect them.

I promise that you will be in charge of my football and my first kteghekatsnem FFA page or the official website:

It is also a bit disrespectful to pretend it was free to the people who have paid for it.

Healthcare is expensive. A small thing of pills can be hundreds or thousands of pounds. This comes from our taxes. That means cleaners in Hull earning minimum wage are paying for it, or that we are taking money that could be spent on education and spending it on making those drugs 'free'.

I don't think anyone would want to deny that. 

That fact is that Shetland and Orkney have not sought an exception to the referendum or asked for a separate independence referendum or asked for more powers yet. As such, until the moment that they do, they are part of Scotland and will be treated as part of Scotland.

Well why should they? Islands and rural areas obviously have different needs from more densely populated areas. They often have small, strong communities that are best placed to make local decisions in a manner that a city is unable to. Should we aim for equality across local government at a national scale or look at what powers are needed to best serve communities, even if it varies from region to region?

&gt;Who is saying that the voters on Orkney and Shetland actually do want more powers devolved anyway? 

Just a few councillors. They say that irrespective of the independence referendum they will seek further powers. It is an announcement that they plan to begin a process looking at what powers should be given and one which will probably end in an Islanders referendum. 

In fact,

&gt;The way to get them is to make a case, campaign, get the backing of the electorate and then to work with the government to get them

This is exactly what they are starting to do.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-22839609

**The Sun**: ""I want to wed jailed teacher"" headlining... I'm not sure what else I expected to be honest. No mention of anything related to Snowden, PRISM or Tempora as far as I can see. Apparently David Cameron riding a scooter is more important.

**The Daily Mail**: Same headline story as the Sun... Had to do some digging but they're reporting on Snowden in the US section of the News. Amazingly they are actually reporting on Britain's involvement, but it's half way through the article and not included in the summary points at the top:
&gt;The Guardian claimed Operation Tempora had been running for 18 months and GCHQ and the NSA are consequently able to access vast quantities of communications between innocent people as well as targeted suspects, including phone calls, the content of email messages, Facebook entries and a user's internet history.



http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2346765/NSA-whistleblower-Edward-Snowden-leaves-Hong-Kong-Russia-voluntarily-helped-WikiLeaks.html

**The Independant**: Reporting on Snowden, it's now on their front page. Searching the articles for GCHQ and it comes up in the comments but not in the articles. Great. 

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/nsa-whistleblower-edward-snowden-leaves-hong-kong-on-flight-to-moscow-8669963.html

**The Register** (This is a UK tech news site). They're headlining with GCHQ's involvement:

http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/06/21/gchq_nsa_spooks/

**New Statesman**: Entire section devoted to this. Loads of coverage of Snowden, PRISM and GCHQ:

http://www.newstatesman.com/subjects/PRISM

**The Economist**: Reported on Prism 13 days ago, nothing about UK's involvement.

What Starbucks did that was so wrong is they set their company up in such a way the the UK 'Franchise' had to pay the Dutch 'Franchise' X amount of money for the trademark of 'Starbucks' They then bought coffee from their own Supplier in 'Switzerland' and then they borrowed money from themselves and charged massive interests rates in order to off set an profits.

Christ it is merely the tip of the iceberg.. this is how the rich and famous get around it, they get 'hired' by a talent company that is paid by their employer, they then loan the money to the 'Employee' and then right the loan off, it then becomes a deficit on the balance sheet and as such no tax is paid on any earnings...

It's not necessarily the firearms laws I have an issue with, if handguns were ""easier"" to get then it'd be more of an issue I guess, maybe. If I get a more permanent residence I'm going to get a nice sporting over/under for clays and pests on private land. It's more the ""you can't own anything more dangerous than a biro."" 

Do criminals care if its legal to walk around with a kitchen knife? No. I'm sure the parents of all the kids who get stabbed every year by gangs find it comforting to know that it was done illegally and in a utopian society the murderer wouldn't have armed themselves with the weapon.

As for sites in the categories you list: mobile phone providers already block such sites by default. An account owner must contact their provider to disable the block. The process by which a block is instated is not transparent, and it is difficult and time-consuming for an incorrectly-blocked site to have the block removed.

My point is that it is not inherently right or wrong to kill someone. Absolute moral positions have nothing more than conviction and in some cases inspiration from God. Those who object to gay marriage use the same language as you do; it is inherently wrong. Given you're on reddit I'll take the assumption you've no objection to Gay marriage so how do you feel about those who oppose it for moral reasons? 

As for your last point I don't view killing or anything else as inherently right or wrong but that does not mean I can't understand that we need laws and other constructs to function. We clearly do. A few hundred years ago it was not uncommon to marry add young as 12. Now that is illegal. Moral codes evolve, which should emphasise that they are not absolute. 

So to answer your question I don't think that killing sometime is inherently wrong but it does make a sensible basis to have strict rules regarding situations under which it is acceptable.

I don't think that's quite right. What was the *raison d'être* of the Big Brother regime? With the answer to that, it's clear that all the intrusions and invasions of privacy were just an effect; a logical conclusion of a regime that wished to control what one thought as a way of staying in power indefinitely, not a cause in itself. Although we cannot trust the version of history laid out in Goldstein's book, there is no basis to conclude that things were moving steadily along some libertarian-authortarian spectrum with more and more telescreens and cameras and then.. poof, suddenly the entire apparatus of the 1984 state now exists.

Of course, the word ""intrusion"" is misleading in itself as that implies that it is unwanted - one commonly missed takeaway from the book is that most people are extremely passive towards their fate and even genuinely applaud or make excuses for the regime.

It's become a cliche to describe the book as a warning, but in my interpretation the thing that it is *least* is a ""warning"" - all the underlying themes (the abolition of history, undermined family structures, pervasive propoganda, cult of celebrity, the aforementioned excuse-making, stunted/repressed sexuality, etc. etc.) were well-established at the time and taken from current  affairs, merely amplified and condensed in the novel.

It even appears to be set in England (beyond the slightly dull literary reasons of reader identification and shock factor) only to demonstrate that English-speaking people are no different from any other arbitrary grouping of human beings, and that the contemporary undertones that the Soviet, colonial Indian or Burmese people ""needed"" or perhaps even preferred (!) to live under dictatorial rule was nothing beyond the most despicable racism.

In a lot of European countries you're not going to find much more than Lays (Walkers) and a few other brands, and they for sure don't have as much variety as you can get in Britain.

That's just one area, there's a lot that are similar. Sweets too are a great example of the ridiculous amount of choice we have. There's not many things where you can say another country has more choice than there is in Britain of a certain type of Product, other than perhaps things that are more specific to that country. Sure, maybe some places rival the choice you have of Cheese or whatever, but I think on the whole, Britain has an awful lot of choice.

Well, that's what it all comes down to, ultimately. If we lived in a more libertarian society where every individual was responsible for their own well-being, and any mistakes that individual made affected only them or their close contacts, then that would all be fine and we could happily let them get on with ruining their own lives.

But we don't live in a world like that. Our social fabric is complicated and tight-knit and we do have socialized health-care and an economic system in which the actions of one can easily affect the fortunes of many others. Until that no longer becomes the case, there will always be argument for legislation against advertising and shady practices that threaten to damage society.

Now, I'm not saying we *should* necessarily ban or limit adverts like that, but you can't deny that preying on individuals in the way these companies do has a real and measurable impact on quality of life for not only the people directly involved, but everyone else as a knock-on consequence (e.g. things like more people becoming financially unstable, neighbourhoods decaying, increased crime etc.)",0,1371994340,null,0,false,0,caok02k,t3_1guqmp,t1_caok02k,t1_caojtyu,null,1430712307,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,atheistmil,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; The laws we have are sufficient to stop people killing and indeed the per capita murder rate has gone down so from a utilitarian point of view we don't need the death penalty. 

That's a bit of a leap. The death penalty is not there to prevent murder or any other crime simply as an option of last resort for crminals that society deems too unsafe and does not wish to incarcerat efor life. 

&gt; There's also the argument that laws which provide a legal framework within which governments may kill civilians can and will be exploited for political ends to the detriment of society and furthermore provide a poor example to people about what is acceptable.

You have a reasoanble point here and I'd agree with you.

&gt; The evidence about people being let out of prison and re-offending is not endless it is finite. Within that cohort the number of people who have been convicted of a crime which would have attracted a capital penalty while it existed and then have gone on to commit another offence of the same seriousness must necessarily be very few.

Well yes, endless was a a bit of an exaggeration. Though yes it must be a very few indeed if I were to support the death penalty it would be for a very few number indeed.

&gt; Unless, of course, you are proposing the death penalty for crimes other than murder?

I am not proposing anything as such this is where I was playing devils advocate. My main contention was that yours (and others) in this thread shut down sensible debate on the subject because you view it as inherently wrong and use insult of ""wrong headedness"" rather than actually dealing with the argument.

There are a vast number of things which could be perceived as being detrimental to individuals and society which I am sure you do not think should be banned (or maybe not?). Alcohol is a great example, as well as gambling, all dangerous sports, motorcycles, tobacco, fatty foods, lack of exercise, unprotected sex or even ""addictive"" games like WoW. In order to take the view that you take, you need to objectively argue why some of these things are ok, whereas others are too dangerous for consenting adults to deal with.

Alternatively, you could accept that there are some things that are indirectly harmful to society, but the only way we can realistically mitigate the harm they cause is by educating the population better, so they can make good decisions themselves, rather than having that decision made for them (I'd argue that the prevalence of illegal drugs throughout the world despite prohibition is a shining example of how trying to take that decision away from people doesn't work).

true,SkyPilotOne,eng-GreaterLondon,LBB&amp;D,"&gt;The death penalty is not there to prevent murder or any other crime simply as an option of last resort for criminals that society deems too unsafe and does not wish to incarcerate for life.

See this was why I wanted you to set out your terms before we started because you're being a bit slippery here. Seems like any time the argument for one paradigm starts getting a bit sketchy you leap to another and so what we've ended up with is you arguing for a very limited number of cases, on the grounds that :

i.  the convict is just too dangerous to have around

ii. society doesn't wish to keep locked up permanently

I would argue that there's nobody who is just that dangerous. I think killing someone just because you don't want to keep them in prison is a pretty poor state of affairs. The usual argument about this is framed in terms of cost but although a strong argument can be advanced for life imprisonment being financially less expensive than an execution protocol with proper judicial oversight and checks and balances I do not wish to pursue it. 

Instead I shall say that I think that there is a greater cost to society to executing someone for the reasons I stated before and you agreed with.

So here's my summary of our discussion:

* Capital Punishment is not, in your opinion or mine, a deterrent.
* It would place an authority in the hands of the state which would be open to abuse.
* It would not prevent re-offending of the most heinous kind, this happening most often when violent criminals who had not committed murder escalate their violence.
* There is no pressing societal need for it to be re-introduced.

This is why I say, in the light of these arguments which have been put forward many, many times before, that people who support the re-introduction of the death penalty in the teeth of of all these arguments are wrong-headed.

Victory of the daleks.  Somehow the Doctor modifies THREE planes with internal combustion engines, and unsealed cockpits to fly in space?  All in the timeframe of 3 minutes or so?  Mighty Morhpin Power Daleks?  Lame.  For an extinct race they show up an awful lot.  I can ALMOST forgive the Cult of Skaro showing up so much, but the bottom line is simple:  To stop the Dalek and his own people, the doctor killed them ALL.  Gatiss repopulated the race with his little progenitor device and ruined that VERY cool part of the storyline.  That is an 

Cold war was terrible in the fact that he took an iconic monster and completely changed it.  They are no longer humanoid, but just something in powered armor?  Not to mention the entire episode was blatantly stolen from Alien.  Ever see how much room is in a MODERN sub, never mind a cold war sub?  There is none!  There are no places for an alien to hide, nor a tall ceiling to cling to.

Crimson horror.  Holy hell that was THE worst episode I've ever seen...and I've watched all of Colin Baker's episodes.  Thomas thomas?  What the hell was the point of putting a GPS joke in Dr Who?  The story made no sense at all.  It was like Gatiss came up with a cool name (Crimson Horror) and tried to write a story around just that.  The only redeeming part of that episode was Strax and the horse.  and while I like Strax, his whole persona also ruins an iconic bad guy.

Lets talk the episode where people got their faces sucked off by a TV monster.  ....and somehow survived despite the idea that people tend to need AIR to live.  How about how the tv alien was recorded onto a betamax tape....despite the fact that betamax wasnt invented for another ten years or something.

Charlie dickens of all people saving the day.  Not a 900 year old alien that has overcome every alien out there including daleks, cybermen, the great intelligence, egyptian gods.  No.  Charlie.  Dickens.  He turned on the gas in the house to....suck out the aliens...like poison from a wound???

The dollhouse episode.  People get shrunk down and put into a dollhouse...and turn into dolls.  Thats supposed to be good writing?  

If you watch carefully, I think Gatiss looks for anything people find scary and makes a lame parody of those fears.  Creepy dolls, ghosts, Alien movie style monsters jumping at you from above, etc.  i'm willing to bet he'll write an episode about spiders due to the propensity of Reddit NOPE posts.

Also, everything he has written is solved by deus ex machina...the WORST literary solution ever.  Its not the doctor who saves the day as he should, but some outside force that typically makes little sense.

These are just the first things that come to my head for each episode.  I could go on and on and be a little more precise in my criticism, but I'm not sure I want to subject myself to watching that crap again.  I honestly can't see what ANYONE sees in this guys writing.

A lot of people who get to interview stage tell us they aren't prepared to do any driving or travel. Pisses me off as it is quite clearly stated in the job advertisement what is involved. We are even providing the vehicle, not expecting people to us their own.

Took me 7 months to find the right person last time I looked. I am sick of hearing about how there are no jobs, when not one of the people I interviewed over a 3 month period seemed interested in the slightest.

Your own timeline remains linear and continuous, it just loops back onto itself and shoots off in a new direction, which is cool if paradoxical to those that expect all of time to be linear.

But in the pre-event paradox, you have to have done something that you couldn't have done to get to where you can do what you do. Man that's a mess. But it has helped me to see what I was missing.

Rather than living with a broken roof for 5 days, you borrow the £100 or whatever, then pay them back a week later after you've been paid with about 25% interest. It's nonsensical to deal with APRs with payday loans, because they're *supposed to be used for short term loans*. If they used regular APR rates, they'd make absolutely no money because the loans are paid back so quickly. 

Just because there are idiots who don't know what they are and use them for long term loans (and so stack up 100s of % interest) it doesn't mean they aren't useful to normal people.

You seem to just be taking some minor details from each episode, and using it as a reason why the entire episode is poorly written. Subs being small doesn't mean Cold War was written poorly, it means they used movie magic to tell a story. Nor does flying planes in space with a show like Doctor Who, which has had way more ridiculous things. And even if that was a reason to say that one detail was bad, doesn't make the entire episode bad. Or complaining about Gatiss bringing back the Daleks when RTD literally brought back the Daleks every single season he was running the show, and he's the one that wrote them out of existence. Not to mention the episode was most likely written at the request of Moffat, meaning Gatiss had little to nothing to do with having the Daleks in the episode.

See, this is exactly what I'm talking about. Being shrunk down and turned into dolls has *nothing* to do with writing. Literally nothing.

But I note that there is a huge gulf between what *is* and what *should be*.

The current situation is the outcome of a 22-year process of the security services hunting for a new remit in the wake of the end of the Cold War (during which period their duties and the justification for them were fairly clear to everybody, including those who disagreed with them).

We had security services and, by the iron law of bureaucracy, over time most of the activity of any bureaucracy comes to be devoted to finding new tasks to justify its continued existence. There is also the interesting question of corporate contractors lobbying to keep their chosen government host in business -- by some estimates, the NSA and CIA outsource nearly $50Bn of work to large corporations each year, corporations who in turn lobby Congress to keep their agencies funded. It's a dead certainty that similar, albeit more discreet, activities happen in the UK.

Again, this *is*. That it *should not happen* is also true, but note the word ""should"" in that statement.

The real question, to echo Lenin, is ""what is to be done?""",0,1372001466,null,0,false,0,caoli05,t3_1gwhsn,t1_caoli05,t1_caoj12n,null,1430711602,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

4) I feel the Time War works far better unseen. Characters can bring up events or names from the War and the viewer can create far more terrifying images than television ever could.

Ultimately, Parker starts drifting forward to help with this transition, and boom, defensive gaps. By bringing in Paulinho, Sandro can claim the ball, and (assuming a 4-3-3 with Dembele, Paulinho, Sandro in the middle), short it to one of his partners, allowing the other to join the attack, while not abandoning his defensive position.

true,sinistersuperspy,tardis,TARDIS,"I'd like to point out that Moffats' writing under RTD was stand out. Some of the best episodes on Who. 

It was natural that he would be given the wheel after Russ left. He was the strongest candidate - he'd been involved in Who writing since the 90's. Blink originated [here] (http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/What_I_Did_on_My_Christmas_Holidays_by_Sally_Sparrow_(short_story).

That being said, while there was a vibe and flow to series 5 and 6, series 7 was clumsy and somewhat incoherent.

The end of ""The Wedding of River Song"" had The Doctor stating he was going to retreat to the shadows for awhile. He got too big, too noisy etc.


Series 7 sees the Ponds and The Doctor on the outs a bit, but he's still fairly out there, prancing about etc. Dalek-Clara successfully erases The Doctor from the Dalek database - suggesting the disappearance of The Doctor is underway.

The remainder of series 7 sees very little of The Doctor actually stepping back.

Then we got ""The Snowmen"", where he'd apparently been grousing around in Victorian London. Not that we could really tell. Because then he's right back in it.

This was, for me, the biggest let down of series 7. Fine - The Ponds move on. Great Clara is into'd as a new, if curious companion. But the idea of The Doctor operating in the background, reigniting the mystery of who he is - would have lent itself better to the story arc of ""The First Question"". 

Let's be honest - he's been fairly front and center since Matt Smith came on board. The idea of a darker, toned down, brooding Doctor, cautiously outsmarting and side-stepping ne'er do-wells without drawing attention to himself was a tantalizing reason to tune back in.

finally - Steven Moffat has been excellent at coming up with really scary monsters - but lately kind of going nowhere with them. 

The Weeping Angels - terrifying in ""Blink"", compounded in ""The Time of Angels/Flesh &amp; Stone"", and then ultimately, nefariously evil in ""The Angels take Manhattan"".

The Silence - Creatures you forget you saw once you look away - Brilliant!!! And although The Doctor successfully managed to empower Humanity to wipe out The Silence (at least those on Earth), I had hoped they would continue to play a role in The Doctors unfurling origins as Series 7 continued. Alas. Also Who else thought ""wibbly wobbly"" of ""Silence in The Library"". I know I did.

The Whisper Men - Cronies of GI - who should have been established earlier on to make them more relevant - Creepy, disturbing - and I thought great henchmen - but went nowhere and did nothing ultimately - I also thought that they didn't murder Jenny, but simply implied to her she had been, while whispering - if your brain believes it to be true - then it must be, right? Missed potential.

All in all - Moffat has a long and well known love of Doctor Who. I remember reading that in prepping for Series 7, he went to the writing team and as they broke down the various plots, he apparently said ""DOn't tell me about plots. Show me the poster!!"". 

Series 7 had some really cool posters for each episode - unfortunately, its a very hollywood attitude, going back to when ""Alien"" was pitched as ""jaws in space"". 

How it looks is not enough - context, body, impact on the characters and their worldview - as well as how it relates to where the show is going - are all things a show runner should be considering when planning a season - 

Here's hoping The 50th, The Christmas Special, and Series 8 are treated with this level of care.

Ok rant done.

true,C051n3,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"This is my main criticism of the Moffat era, really intriguing or interesting story ideas or premises or epic storylines that aren't allowed enough time to be developed or revised and edited for continuity and pacing, especially Moffat's finales.  
Wedding of River Song - such a killer and emotional first act that literally drags you toward a cliff of suspense only to have 11 open his eyes comically wondering why he's not dead and River saying Hello sweetie for the millionth time then back out of the flashback into the second and third acts which just drag and drag on and have moments of brilliance but then cheats on the ending and set-up more questions that may or may not get answered.  Frustratingly almost great.

Name of the Doctor- Arguably the single most fan-alienating episode Moffat has ever written, and I have watched it ten times because there are flashes of genius throughout I still enjoy it despite how mad it makes me.  The stealing of the TARDIS revealed to be a suggestion by Clara all along just shits on Neil Gaiman's contribution to the DW mythos of him admiring the TARDIS for years in a museum and how it was actually she who chose him.  Defining the place and manner in which the Doctor at some point will die removes so much of the mystery of his destiny that made him such a compelling character in the first place. His last minute rescue of Clara seems so rushed and nebulous because Moffat probably was saying to himself ""Crap, I have to wrap this up. Okay...so he goes in and...cut to scene of Clara in...I don't know... some cave...huh...oh...the cave represents Clara seeing all the personas of the Doctor at once so she starts seeing the other 10 doctors walking around the cave...Yeah that works...then she hears the Doctor talking to her...okay briefly mention the leaf to remind the audience Clara's not just a plot device...the Doctor lands in the cave and they hug..There ya go...that ties that bow rather nicely. JOHN HURT!"" Just a maddening episode that both tantalizes and tortures because of what it does right and what it does even more wrong.
I'm getting tired of the machinery of the entertainment production complex that because of their over-competiveness feel the need to beat the other guys or work within a schedules that doesn't place the story concerns at a premium.  It's getting to be where I can telling the ending to a 2/3rds fantastic movie was shitty because they were just trying to wrap it up.

It just means that when you do get there it is a pedestrian area, which might be quite nice, maybe people will want it every week, or even all the time if it is practicable. All things being equal, I prefer pedestrian centres where possible. Again, I don't know Bristol.

That means I'll have to buy a new dress and two presents this week too, although the friend who's turning 21 would probably rather I accompanied her to TK Maxx to choose her own, so that takes care of that.

It's not a paradox, it's a stable timeloop :)

A paradox would be if you hadn't yet gone back in time from your present point of view. Then, yes, it's a paradox. (eg the Doctor goes back to free himself even though he wasn't freed earlier by himself, so how come he is free to free himself?) (another eg: Going back in time to prevent X from happening. But once you have done this, X didn't happen and thus you never went back in time to prevent X as you didn't have the motivation which causes X to occur which gives you the motivation to go back, etc)

Basically, a paradox is when you have two situations that influence each other but are opposite in nature. Two realities occur simultaneously. 


A stable timeloop is when a future version saves a past version which causes the past version to save his past past version, etc. There's no real starting point and no real end. But they're not opposite in nature, they simply feed each other, self-sustaining if you want.

&gt;And to be fair, we have seen it before. The Second Doctor, knowing he was going to be executed, didn't really go quietly.

But this only proves the point. The only reason why The Doctor was upset was because he was having a regeneration forced upon him by the Time Lords. Even in the story he calms down when he's told that he'll get to choose his next face, but again becomes angry when all the faces he's shown are horrible choices. It was pretty clear that he wasn't upset about regenerating, but rather was upset that the Time Lords were forcing it upon him and exiling him to Earth.

Bristol's origins date back to some time around 1000 CE. There have been signs of humans in the Avon gorge for thousands of years prior, and apart from evidence of a station of Romans at Sea Mills the real juicy stuff started around Bristol Bridge. The earliest relics we have to base the origin of Bristol are some coins found in Scandinavia (of all places), which bear the date of 1000 A.D along with the town's name 'Brycgstow' which roughly meant 'the place of the bridge'. It is thought that Bristol was founded long before this to grant it enough time to have it's own mint, naturally. The fact the coins were found so far away confirms that Bristol has always been a commercial maritime hub.

The bridge in question is the one found joining current-day Victoria Street and High St. The street plan of early Bristol basically consisted of High St., Corn St., Broad St., and Wine St. in a cross formation. If you take a look on Google maps, where these four roads converge, you'll see the south-east quarter existing as a park-cum-hideous-1960-bank. We have the Luftwaffe Urban Design Committee to thank for that. Before their rezoning, it was a dense quarter of quaint Dutch houses and shops.

The bridge was built a few feet upriver of the confluence of the then route of the River Frome, which took its course along current day Baldwin Street (which was at the time an effluence runoff rather than an important quay. Thick city walls surrounded the perimeter of town which extended from its most western point at the opening to Claire/Corn st (cafe Gusto), to the still remaining north gate found at the end of Broad St. where it bridged the Frome (some buildings still bear the name Fromesgate), and to the east somewhere around castle park/broadmead/oldmarket (I've had a hard time visualising as it's mostly modern buildings with no old roadplan).

The city walls were built first by the Saxons, but were later extended once the Normans invaded. A 'Motte and Bailey' castle was built at Castle park in the decades after 1066 and served as a centre of administration (and tyranny) for centuries to come.

Fast forward a period of time (the specifics of which escape me) and two major things happened (the specifics of which order also escape me; aren't I useless...). The embankment now at Welshback, named for the nationality of sailors that tended to anchor there, was reinforced to become a solid quay side. Apparently this single construction event was the single largest civil engineering project at that moment in time in world, and in true Bristol fashion caused a huge palava as it drew on funds from both the Gloucestershire and Somerset side of the Avon - the city until this time (and for a while later) existed as two administrations split along the river. This nicely mirrors the constant ball-ache of dialogue between Bristol City, Bath &amp; North East Somerset, and South Gloucester experienced today.

The second major civil engineering project was to reroute the course of the From from along Baldwin street to along the path of the fountains in the centre today. This was done to create extra quay space, which was rapidly running out as Bristol became busier and busier.

There is a third, more modern civil engineering project from recent times. In the 19th century it was accepted that the tidal nature of the Avon (which was a pain for planning the influence and egress of ships around the city) was holding back progress. The term 'Ship shape and Bristol fashion' comes from this tidal annoyance, as ships had to be rock-solid and their cargo safe and secure to survive the low tide beaching their vessels. It was thus decided that the Avon should be tidal locked and turned into a 'floating harbor' by which it means all the ships within it were always floating.

This was achieved by first carving a new river near Bedminster with explosives, and then damming the opening to the harbor at Cumberland basin and further upstream. This also has an effect on the silt that forms in the commercial harbor but my memory fails me as to whether it was positive or negative - I do remember that the Bristol Port Company had to wait years before it could pay a divident as a result of complicated issues with dredging silt, but I digress.

At any rate, the floating harbor was only short lived a useful commercial construction as in the decades and century that followed, Bristol was overtaken by ports such as Liverpool. One of the reasons for this was the winding nature of the Avon as it approached the sea. The newer transatlantic steam-powered marvels found it hard to navigate the bends, even at high tide, so the consensus was to built a new port at Avonmouth and throw the floating harbour under the bus.

Somewhere around this time, after multiple bankruptcies and the eventual death of it's engineer the Clifton Suspension Bridge was finished (as I am legally obliged to shoe-horn in as it is the city's darling achievement).

Between the first bridge being built and our new mayor closing all the streets around it to motorised traffic (today), there have been rebellions (Bristol effectively rebelled against the ruling monarch for many years, on many occasions), the quiet and not-so-quiet management of the hideous 'third passage' across the Atlantic that will forever cloud the city in shame, multiple riots, engineering masterpieces, and so much more you could write a book about it.

I'll go into more detail another time if you want.

EDIT my original post back in:

My biggest gripe with Moffat is his affinity for making sure any events he causes get rewritten or erased. So it happened, but then he thought ""that might annoy people, better take it back."" There's been only maybe 2-3 things he's kept after doing (Amy/Rory's death, etc.) but even those might get retconned eventually by him. He's too afraid to take any risks whatsoever. And the plotholes. My God, the amount of plotholes in his writing. We never even got the answer to why Amy/Rory were on the other Hill waving back at them. We literally never saw them go back there to do that. And it made no sense to include that moment at all.

Also the over-archs. My God they are abysmal. Series 5 was a crack. Ok that's fine. Then it turned out the exploding TARDIS was the cause. Awesome. Great mystery- oh wait it never got solved or explained whatsoever. Series 6. Not going to lie. I barely even remember the Series because I felt like I could skip it and not miss anything at all that I didn't already know. Because it was all obvious already. Series 7 was nothing short of Moffat's idea of ""taking a risk"" and mainstreaming up the show for general audiences with nothing connecting it together except us already knowing what happens beforehand (Ponds' leaving the show and Clara being some kind of all-important plot device for The Doctor's life).

Moffat cannot come up with anything genuinely clever and keep it clever. He brings something potentially amazing up and then immediately dismisses it, retcons it/goes back on it, or gives us the most obvious and boring explanation for it.

And don't take me for an RTD fanboy. RTD had his fair share of problems as well when it came to plot. But at least he wrapped up almost every loose end he had during his time.

Stephendy is right that there's a clear pattern for BBC News Online to play down controversial stories. Another example is the regular practice of changing a story after publication. A headline about a scandal will start out as a straight-forward description of the allegations, it will rise to the top of the 'most read' list, then later on in the day the minister involved will make a comment, and the headline will be rewritten to something much more vague, along the lines of 'minister refutes all allegations'.

Bear in mind that in the modern world, censorship does not primarily operate through preventing publication, but through burying the story in a flood of other information.

Instead, those sales (and thus profit) show up in a tax haven where their affiliate company is based and thus they'd pay very little tax. What the government should ideally do give the HMRC broader powers to investigate profit declarations and stricter laws on how you can deduct expenses.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"We are probably being used, but not because of anything he's said publicly. I don't think his comments really change the situation too much because it was already established in private.  

A) The player has a release clause. This means a team isn't going to blow us out of the water on a transfer fee. They can still offer more money in a contract of course.

B) The player is very well-known worldwide by clubs. Maybe fans don't know a lot about Brazilian football but any decent-sized club knows all about Paulinho.

If a club wants to bid on Paulinho, they will. I don't think his comments suddenly made big clubs perk their ears up. The situation is pretty clear cut: if a bigger team wants him they can get him comfortably. 

I have a bad feeling he will be a Chelsea player, to be honest. He's a Mourinho type of player and he would fit in well there with all his national teammates and a coach who speaks his language. I hope I'm wrong but Chelsea in particular like to cockblock teams all the time and we've been the victim of it as recently as last season. 

Duncan Castles said we still face competition for his signature and there are just too many things going against us IMO. We can't match Chelsea's wages, he could circumvent the work permit crap if he went to Spain or Italy, and he's apparently good enough to get solid playing time at most clubs. 

If you want to achieve this sort of coup, you usually need to get it done before a tournament starts. We had Modric tied up in May when we bought him, and that's the only reason it happened. It's a lot easier for a team like Madrid or Chelsea to blow through negotiations than it is for us.

As an aside and in reply to the sort of stuff I know will be cluttering this comment section. Why do people always find it easier to believe that there must be something they don't know than that they may be mistaken. If 2 and 2 make 5 the answer is never to check the arithmetic, it's to assume 2 and 2 actually do make 5 and the idea that it makes 4 is propaganda by some authority figure. They wriggle out of the unlikelyness of their claim by further claiming everyone else in authority is paid off and sworn to secrecy apparently ignoring the fact that by extension these people (who are so lacking in loyalty that they can be bought off in the first place) seem to have suddenly forgotten they could make even more money selling the story to the newpapers and appear to have more efficient security than the NSA and GCHQ. 

2 top secret spy agency can be brought to their knees by one leak but apparently the 'fact' that the BBC has always been paid off by the government has escaped the public scrutiny of the BBC in recent years. Of the 'fact' that the judiciary are all bribed government lackeys, they have had no leakers of information despite the worse punishments they could levy would be to be fired compared to Snowdon who faces life in jail. There's no real downside to blowing the whistle on the BBC or any other organisation that doesn't deal in security apart from the end of your career compared to Bradley Manning or Snowdon who face insanely harsh punishment. And yet it's the NSA who have the leak. That should probably tell you something or you should at least wait until we have evidence of such claims. This is meant as a general comment on stories like this not this article in particular as it doesn't go that far but people so frequently do go that far and beyond and it's fucking stupid.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"It is saving money but it's also putting huge strain on people to move out of their houses and downsize when there are no houses to move into. In theory it might have been a decent plan if there had been an adequate opportunity to move but there isn't and the government's response is to charge people money they don't have because of a problem the government is responsible for. 

You seem to assume giving money away to people that need it is a bad thing. I mean, following that logic lets get rid of the NHS - we'd save so much money on people who never paid enough in taxes to cover the treatment they got...I mean they'd suffer hugely and be bankrupt if they survived but screw it. If giving money away is the enemy, so be it. Why have uni fees at 9000 a year, why not stop giving money to ungrateful students and make them pay 40,000 like the Americans do. I mean, yes it would put a university education out of reach for many and for those that borrowed to afford it they would have a 6 figure debt hanging over them most of their working lives but it's still saving money. Getting rid of council housing would increase the homeless population but it'd save us money, why give people pensions they got paid, this is just extra. 

The point I'm making, possibly with too much sarcasm, is that we give money away to people so that they don't have to worry about health, education or to a certain extent money when trying to do something with their lives. The more money everything costs the more of a benefit it is to have more of it. The more things cost, the more the poor are shut out but the rich will always have the cash. We subsidise this stuff so that the poor are not shut out and we have a fairer, more equal, healthier, more educated and more socially mobile society. The rich should want this as much as the poor because I would hope they care about the state of society in general not just their own personal wealth over others.

Things I disliked

1) Master turning into everyone - just terrible, the cgi, the idea just urgh. They should have made it DNA transfer, so the masters DNA made humans/timelords 

2) The Timelords having nothing to do - they appear, then disappear. I'd  have had them stick around, leave the lonely God crap with 9/10 


3) The 20 minute goodbye - WAAAAAAAAAWH I R DYING SO IM GOING TO SEE ALL OF MY FRIENDS...all of whom he can go and see again

4) Rose f*cking Tyler 

5) Tennant's last words - They piss me off so much, so much melodrama....just before Eccleston regenerated, he told Rose he wasn't dying, skip on 4 years and he tells Wilf regeneration is death. It's inconsistent writing, also if the Doctor doesn't want to change, how is the audience meant to accept a new Doctor? Poor Matt Smith had no chance

I loved the Doctor's goodbye, as well. After the rough transitional period that was Eccleston's season (although I did like it in it's own way) they nailed Tennant's departure. Not only that, but it was the end of the RTD era, which brought in a complete changing of the guard, with only one character that I know of appearing in a later season. So they had to tie up every last character's remaining plotlines, and the Doctor had to say goodbye to each of them in his own way.

I also absolutely loved Tennant's last line: ""I don't want to go."" Quick Tennant history lesson: Tennant started acting in hopes of one day appearing on Doctor Who. He loved it as a kid, and watched it every time it was on. It's apparent, though, in his last line, as it was completely ad libbed. That line isn't just the Tenth Doctor saying goodbye, it's David Tennant saying farewell to the role that he waited his whole life for.

Actually, there are very few appropriate treatments that aren't funded on the NHS, through the auspices of NICE. There are a few that are not really appropriate, but are politically valuable, some of the breast cancer treatments for eg. [note, this is for certain patients, not all of them]

My opinion about rich people paying for extra treatments? It's a bad idea. No one should be considered a priority over anyone else, because they have extra cash available. Discrimination on any grounds when it comes to health-care isn't just distasteful, its evil in the long run. I understand you weren't directly talking about discrimination, however that's what it works out as. I'm opposed to consultants and specialist health professionals having private practices for the same reason. Yes, in the real world it happens, and generally works as a compromise, however I've seen situations where a private practice takes precedence over the poor schlubs admitted via the NHS.. fortunately few and far between, but it does happen. 

I agree with your point that the NHS isn't free overall, but I suspect you disregarded the long-term mechanics. Someone who can't afford a prescription nowadays will receive it free of charge, in a few years time odds are that person will be earning and paying into National Insurance, more than paying back the earlier expenses. In the same way, the elderly who are catching so much flak nowadays for being a drain on the NHS have already paid their whole lives into NI, they deserve the best treatment we can give them.

Antennae - Exit

2Pac - All Eyez On Me 

Danny Brown - The Hybrid

Lil B THE BASEDGOD - Rain In England

Tech N9ne - Sickology 101

Lupe Fiasco - Lupe Fiasco's Food &amp; Liquor

MadWorld OST

Black Eyed Peas - Behind the Front

which were basically some Hip-Hop and RnB essentials, as well as some other 'essentials' from an /mu/ sharethread.

Fav artists are 'Death Grips' and Danny Brown.

Got a new IPod today as well, the HD in my 80GB was too small anyway, and then it got a shit load of bad sectors and stopped synching music, which is 160GB so I need to fill that up anyway.

Edit: Here's a link to the pastebin with sky's (/mu/ poster) sharethread albums on if anyone fancies.

It goes way back into the classic episodes I think in the Tom Baker or Peter Davison eras.

of course there have a been a few ways around it. The Master refused to die and became this deformed husk, then stole the body of Tremas on Traken. On the Five Doctors, the Time Lords told him it was possible to be given a new life cycle (12 regenerations) for his stolen body.

The man is a racist, and he is a bigot, and his repetition of those two facts doesn't make them any less true, or any less reprehensible. The video is a tissue of lies, misdirection, omissions and implications.

It is disingenuous to assert that Islam is the cause of all the violence in countries such as Syria, as it cavalierly ignores the myriad of other factors that may play apart. Likewise, to state that the spread of Islam will inescapably lead to the streets of England being drenched in blood within a scant few decades is alarmist, unsupported, and deeply dishonest. 

It is disingenuous to pretend that the suffix ""phobia"" refers entirely to fear, just as it would be to insist that ""elevators"" can only go up - it ignores the actual, well-documented, usage of the term. 

It is disingenuous to ignore the vast numbers of peaceful muslims in order claim to that Islam is a violent and savage political ideology.

It is not simply disingenuous, but a bare-faced and entirely intentional lie to say  that one is not allowed to speak out against the hanging of homosexuals or the stoning of women. That is very, very far from the truth, and he knows that, and he says it anyway. That fact, in itself, demonstrates that he is lying.

I don't know whether the approval he is finding here is due to ignorance or malice, but either way this kind of knowingly dishonest rhetoric is a far more present danger than Islam.

Look past the fact that he is wearing a tie and conforming to your prejudices - this is a man who is unironically claiming that we will be beheading infants in public squares soon. This is a man who thinks that Tony Blair deliberately laid the foundations for a religious war in Surbiton. 

This venomous, crawling poison is despicable, and yet it is being lapped up. What makes it worse is that it isn't even subtle - I'd like to use the word ""insidious"", but it just doesn't apply: it is very clearly vicious nonsense. To be taken in requires either complete idiocy, or a devout and overpowering wish to rationalize bigotry. 

There are arguments to be made about immigration, and the role of religion in society, and even over whether Blair's entire cabinet should be tried for treason. This isn't one of them. This is hatred and lies spewed forth to justify prejudice. 

I agree with only one thing that he says: 

&gt; let's start denouncing an ideology that is the most primitive, backward, and savage ideology. 

This small-minded falsehood pretending to be public service is primitive, backwards, and savage. I care about my culture, and no part of my culture states that I should lie, and spread lies, and drive out those whom I have lied about.

Plus it's a stylistic thing. A lot of people hate it because the show has become darker and eleven is more of a dick than ten.

Secondly, ask your Mother!

Thirdly, tax is calculated by many firms on a per-pay basis (4-weekly, possibly). So, if you go over the threshold for a certain pay period, you'll get taxed and National Insurance taken off at the relevant thresholds. You can claim the tax back at the end of the year if it is under the personal allowance, but you won't be able to claim the N.I. back, unless it was taken in error.

""Gridlock"" involves the Doctor opening doors in cars under him with the sonic, I'd say good for the imagination when in traffic jams yourself or just general pointing the sonic at the ground and pretending to open the floor. But there really isn't an enemy with a clear intention.

""Partners in Crime"" is the first episode of S4 with Donna, and it features both the sonic screwdriver and the sonic pen. Plus, the adipose are adorable, sure to be loved by a three year old.

""The Eleventh Hour"" features fish-fingers and custard and the destruction of 10's screwdriver and the replacement with the model that you own. But that episode sets up the whole ""crack in the wall"" crap.

&gt; Victory of the daleks. Somehow the Doctor modifies THREE planes with internal combustion engines, and unsealed cockpits to fly in space? All in the timeframe of 3 minutes or so?

No, the Doctor did not do that. The android the Daleks built made those modifications. The Doctor was on the Dalek ship. He didn't even know backup was coming. Regarding the Daleks themselves: they needed a reboot. I think it worked well.

&gt; Not to mention the entire episode was blatantly stolen from Alien. Ever see how much room is in a MODERN sub, never mind a cold war sub? There is none! There are no places for an alien to hide, nor a tall ceiling to cling to.

It's true. Cold War was not a very good episode. It did rip off Alien, right down to some of the camera angles from Alien 3. Shoot, the episode even had the stereotypical turncoat trope that is *in every Alien film ever!* (Ash, Burke, Weyland, Call, David)

&gt; Crimson horror.

I'm with you here. That episode's only redeeming quality was the focus on Vastra, Jenny, and Strax. We need more of them. They are a breath of fresh air. Though, I don't think Strax has ruined Sontarons at all. They were a pretty flatly characterized enemy to begin with, so seeing one with a personality is great fun.

&gt; Lets talk the episode where people got their faces sucked off by a TV monster. 

That was a fairly decent episode. It's classic Tennant, though you have to put up with Rose being stupid *once again* - basically a trope itself. Bit of a cheery ending, but whatever - it's supposed to be a kid's show, so I'll allow it.

&gt; Charlie dickens of all people saving the day.

This episode was great. I don't see how it can be a complaint that Dickens saved the day. It made sense in the episode.

&gt; The dollhouse episode. People get shrunk down and put into a dollhouse...and turn into dolls. Thats supposed to be good writing?

I thought this was a good episode. A bit of mystery, mixed with horror and danger. I really liked the part when Amy got turned into a doll, not Rory. He needed a break from his bad luck!

&gt; Also, everything he has written is solved by deus ex machina...the WORST literary solution ever. Its not the doctor who saves the day as he should, but some outside force that typically makes little sense.

I think your criticisms aren't completely founded, but I would agree with you that Mark Gatiss is not a very good Doctor Who writer. He does imploy bad solutions to his problems to end episodes. Whenever I see his name on the credits, I always 'nope'. I audibly said, ""Oh crap, no!"" when I saw his name flash across the titles at the start of Cold War. He isn't bad, but he is run of the mill. Which, for Doctor Who, means bad.

But, to be honest: I'll take a bad episode, even several, if it means we still get several amazing episodes. Doctor Who can survive a bad episode, in my opinion. Yes, we got Cold War. But, we also got Nightmare In Silver!

I'd be fine with removing Mark Gatiss from the writer pool for Doctor Who, though. I think they could do better.

Personally, I would like the influx of other cultures managed to the extent that they do not dominate our own and other cultures should never affect the civil rights and liberties our country has established over hundreds of years. Radical religious mentality has no place in a modern british society and I think it is true to say that we are a largely secular society. To move our native culture away from such mentalities only to have it replaced by similar mentalities from afar is a great step back in my opinion.

Regardless of the above I am always concerned about such groups, the public face is always one of reason and good arguments but the supporting body of society and the people campaigning to this demographic face to face often turn out to be racist cunts.

I suppose the deciding factor is which group concerns me more. 10 years ago it was people like the BNP and the National Front. Today it's probably the influx of violent islamic societies. You could argue that the honour killings, sex rings and public beheadings are rare but I don't believe the mentality behind them is.

Altidore is in his early 20's, athletic, strong, and his finishing is getting better all the time.

No, I don't believe Altidore will be the best striker in the world, ever. But in terms of value, it's hard to argue that he's not worth a look.

Moreover, something that is often overlooked from last term is this; Adebayor was actually quite good the last few games. I'm planning on making a new thread about this tomorrow AM, but I'll go ahead and drop this bombshell here; I think selling Defoe to pick up a you g striker or two, and going into next year with a healthy, fit, and ready to play Adebayor isn't the end of the world.",0,1372043301,null,0,false,0,caoxsw5,t3_1gxeu0,t1_caoxsw5,t1_caowhi1,null,1430705660,0,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,0

I can only assume, then, that you were not a Doctor Who fan of old?  As in John Pertwee, or Tom Baker?  They certainly DO give the race some character.  

Yes, they are clone armies that are bred soully for war, so their *personal* characteristics are next to nothing.  

But the fact that they have a comprehensive background of war with the Rutans, specific methodical and scientific method ways to win their wars gives them a very cool flavor for me.

Again, I'm ok with Strax's silliness, but it sort of goes against the way the sontarans were originally portrayed.  They were smart and methodical, not gun toting buffoons.

true,SpottieOttieDopalis,lfc68,,"De Vrij, Schneiderlin, and Shaw are way off. Shaw would probably cost around £15m, maybe £20m if he signs a new deal this summer, because of how highly rated he is and the fact that Southampton are financially stable. Same thing for Schneiderlin, he just signed a new deal and Southampton won't sell unless they find the price to be too good to turn down. He would probably cost £10-20m and I would be willing to bet it would be closer to £15-20m. De Vrij would probably cost £10-15m as well, simply because he's Feyenoord's captain and Feyenoord are confident he won't leave for a back up role, meaning they won't let go of him that easily. I haven't heard of Biton, but the rest seem to be accurate, although Muriel might be closer to £15m.

It's good a list of players, but the transfermarkt prices are just inaccurate for some players though. I would rank the players on their attributes/potential and by their position/our positional needs, or something like that instead of their transfermarkt prices.

true,Crankyshaft,flair8,,"&gt;The Red Bull company bought the club on 6 April 2005 and rebranded it. After the takeover, Red Bull changed the club's name, management, and staff, declaring ""this is a new club with no history."" Red Bull initially claimed on the club website that the club was founded in 2005, but was ordered to remove this claim by the Austrian F.A. The new authority removed all trace of violet from the club logo and the team now play in the colours of red and white, to the consternation of much of the club's traditional support. A small pair of wings form the motif of the new club crest, displayed on the team jersey, in accordance with Red Bull's commercial slogan at the time: ""It gives you wings."" This complete re-branding of the team proved very similar to Red Bull's treatment of its two Formula One racing teams, Red Bull Racing and Scuderia Toro Rosso. However, Red Bull would not completely follow this precedent when it acquired the MetroStars club in Major League Soccer in the United States; while it rebranded the team as the New York Red Bulls, it chose to recognise the MetroStars' history.

&gt;The traditional supporters tried to resist the radical changes and formed their own movement in order to regain some of the tradition. Several fan-clubs throughout Europe voiced their support in what they saw as a fight against the growing commercialisation of football. However, after five months of protests and talks between the club owners and traditional fans, no compromise was reached. On 15 September 2005, the 'violet' supporters stated that the talks had irreversibly broken down and efforts to reach an agreement would be terminated.

&gt;This gave rise to two separate fan groups: the 'Red-Whites', who support 'Red Bull Salzburg' and the 'Violet-Whites', who want to preserve the 72-year-old tradition and refuse to support the rebranded club. The Violet-Whites ultimately formed a new club, SV Austria Salzburg.",0,1372047533,null,0,false,0,caoz4f3,t3_1gqysr,t1_caoz4f3,t1_caoyr5d,null,1430705038,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

For all of Papa's potential given his price and injury it's a considerable gamble. We can afford to wait another season before finding an upcoming defender if we have Aldeweireld. 

I really don't see us keeping Reina, in fact it would be foolish to. He is the 3rd highest paid player in the squad, in a position that rotation causes weaker performances, without any European football to compensate for such an unusual outlay is ridiculous. 

I know Coutinho was superb as our no. 10 but Mkhitaryan is much more mature in that role. Given his work rate and ability to go box to box he is ideal due to the lack of mobility in our holding midfielders. Also, Coutinho is far more effective wide than Mkhitaryan. 

Personally I'd prefer Suarez central and Sturridge on the right. While he does have an excellent work rate he simply doesn't enjoy running back which isn't surprising given his attacking ability (watch him playing wide right for Uruguay against Nigeria rexently). He is much more comfortable central, and his occasional propensity to give the ball away is less damaging in that position. Foremost though, you want your best player in his best position.

2) The screwdriver. I know. It is not correct. I didn't have time to get the proper sonic. 

3) Clothing. I know. It is not correct. I put the entire costume together hours before the event. This was my first true cosplay.

4) Me IRL instagram: @ triptl

5) Other cons I plan to go to. It all depends on my availability. I work in advertising so I'm constantly busy. I will however go to most Texas cons if I have the time. 

6) Am I single? Yes. Have been for years. Every attempt I've made at changing that has failed.

Firstly - nice work. I have to say that hardly anyone would go through all of that even with the opportunity you have now.

I've looked at the sheet and I think as an exercise it's great - amazing work. You could have even elaborated further and included previous years results, and even charts showing progress and perhaps even relating that to placement on a ladder in each respective league. I guess in a sense the world is your oyster when it comes to this data.

You could potentially add it all in for as many defenders, midfielders and forwards as you like (does any website have this stuff available to export as a .csv file?) and then filter to suit exactly what it is you are looking for with your team.

Either way, good work. Let us know the outcome of this.

true,Dante-Raphael,null,null,"&gt;They were killing each other not because they were Catholic/Protestant, but because they were republicans/royalists.

They were Republican or Royalist because of their religion. The Protestants in NI wanted to remain aligned to the UK because they shared their religious and cultural beliefs, while the Catholics in RoI wanted a unified Ireland to prevent the influence of the culture and religion of Great Britain.

&gt;But how? You cannot force somebody if he doesn't want that.

No, just as you cannot force *anyone*, no matter the race, religion or class they come from to accept the values of the UK, yet largely people do. 

Multiculturalism is important. History has been founded on groups of different people coming together and using their unique perspective and cultures to form arts, sciences, leisures and ideology. 

As a nation, the UK was built on the backs of the Romans, the Angles, the Saxons, the Jutes, the Normans, the Vikings, the Celts, Indians, Americans, Catholics, Protestants, Jews and many others indirectly, with influences spreading across the entirety of Europe.

Islam itself isn't an innately violent thing. The [Islamic Golden Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age) shows this.

The problem is lack of education and stability in the region, not helped by famine, poverty and heavy influence from superior powers such as the USA, Russia, China, France, the UK and so forth throughout its history.

We were in exactly the same position centuries ago, yet through education we prospered and achieved piece. The same is possible for Islamic immigrants. To say that education will not work for them is to claim that they, as a race, are innately inferior, and that is close-minded and ignorant to simple biological fact - as humans we have equal potential for constructing ideas, concepts and socio-political creations.

Peace and education flourished in the UK due to it being innately superior to close-minded barbarity. Those who embraced knowledge and unity survived where cultures who isolated themselves died off. Any people in the UK who close themselves off to the country as a whole will similarly collapse in on itself, leaving those who embraced the country.

The same thing will happen to any microcultures that form in the UK. They will eventually fade away and those who accept the values of the UK will be assimilated into the country. It has happened before and it will happen again.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"Don't use transfermarkt, or prices at all. Seriously, that place has zero authority on prices, is way off, and will make you look completely amateurish and discredit anything useful you have to say elsewhere.

In fact, I would suggest steering clear of using financial numbers at all - as I said above, there's no reliable estimate available to us, mere supporters, of how much players are valued at by their clubs. Add to that the number of unknowns regarding agents, wages, other contract clauses, and media rights, and it becomes a mess. Obviously money matters - hence why you don't want a list containing Isco and Cavani - but don't speculate too much, IMO. 

Also, your statistical approach is pretty lightweight. Why just goals and assists? And why list those at all for a CB? Why not list stuff like tackle success %, 50-50 win %, etc.? Between Squawka and Whoscored, there's plenty available.

Lastly, your squad sheet on the last page isn't great. The squad needs 2 players per position, or at the very least 18 proper senior players for a matchday squad. Right now, a lot of your positions only have a single player, and half the squad is missing. Where's Allen? Where's Henderson? Where's Aspas, who we just signed? 

On that note, you know we won't have 60m to spend, realistically, unless we sell Suarez. I'd go for a lower figure, and keep in mind that with us signing both Alberto &amp; Aspas, we probably won't be signing 3 more attacking midfielders.

Ethics are subjective and change over time, so while they may be a barrier to the reintroduction they will change to accomodate it over time. 

A personal view is that those prisoners who are condemned to multiple life sentences with no view of parole (some 500 of these prisoners exist in the UK) should be given the option of choosing death.

Doctor Who really doesn't deal with String Theory, but many other time travel fantasy genre stuff does. (As well as many Theoretical Physicists)

String Theory is essentially that you go back and change something that has happened, you ""create a new alternate dimension"" and that there are all of these alternate dimensions out there where every little choice exists in each different one.

Spoilerish discussion incoming:

Doctor Who, on the other hand, usually deals with this in ""resolved paradoxes"" We've all heard The Doctor say ""I'm so sorry. It's a fixed point in time"" ""Waters of Mars"" is an awesome episode explaining this concept.  No matter how hard the people in the episode try to avoid the known future, it happens anyway.

Then you have episodes like ""The Wedding Of River Song"" where the paradox wasn't corrected, and time paused, started to collapse in on itself, and didn't return to normal until the paradox was corrected.

As viewers, we would have to believe that even if those exact events of ""The Big Bang"" didn't happen, there would always be some series of events that would lead to a version of The Doctor to get a screwdriver to Rory. And the inverse, should something happen to The Doctor to make him unable to fulfill that fixed point in time, then time would pause and begin to deteriorate until the universe is destroyed or The Doctor finds a way to complete the cycle.

But I do have a problem with episodes like ""Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS"" where you have that pre-event paradox, and only because the Paradox exists do the characters figure out how to escape it.

Got a letter though the door from their debt collection agency last month saying that I now owe them over £400.

They'd banged some random £7 charge on the account somewhere down the line which I can't even find out what for because they've now changed their random charging amounts then started charging me unauthorised overdraught fees because that random charge had left my account in the red. 

So basically banging charges on top of their own random charge to the tune of £400 on an account I asked to have closed which, of course, they now have no record of.  And this is the first I'd heard of any of this even though I know they have both my address, mobile number and my email address. No letter, no call, no email.

Every call I've had with them now hits brick walls, as far as this collection agency is concerned it doesn't matter why I owe them this money, just that I do.

true,free2bejc,1986,Gianfranco Zola,"Am afraid I completely disagree. I would argue that his short range passing is actually more important as an AM and that his lack of long range passing is more exploitable when his is at DM. He is capable of playing longer passes along the floor, as aptly shown by many Nigeria games for years but when he is required to lift the ball a distance Mikel falls short with accuracy and vision to do so.

His scoring record for chelsea is not great I agree, but as probably the most disciplined player on the pitch always tasked with anchoring that is hardly unreasonable. It's the role he's been asked to play, just because he plays that role doesn't mean it's his best role. I sometimes wonder whether he can actually think for himself to the extent that he is obviously always following coaching orders.

I'm not really sure what you're basing his ability to dribble on the run being below that necessary to be a decent AM. Particularly given that none of our current AM's use this facet of their ability much. Hazard probably uses it the most but we've stopped mata taking on players by himself which he is easily capable of doing. Given his strength he'd be like a moses in the middle of the park. Mikel is actually quick, he doesn't use it much in tracking back but that's presumably because he's been told to stand off opponents because his tackling is lacking. Hence Ramires and Oscar will make more tackles in games Mikel is involved in.

So in my conclusion I'll show you some videos. His strength on the turn would be far more utilised going forward, particularly as if he's caught out it's less of a liability and we could have another bruising DM stopper behind him. His pace is evident, particularly in one of the videos as he goes past/through a lot of midfielders. Also when Mikel attacks, he usually keeps the ball for us or wins a free kick because someone just chooses to knock him over instead, although this is likely again because of his discipline rather than a lack of wanting to finish it off.

(after the dancing aha) http://youtu.be/7ix2EObCiek (this also shows some of his tackling 'ability')

Now just to note all the above videos are videos whilst he is playing for Chelsea in his more discipline role.

Now for Nigeria just to show a slightly more attacking more forward position and mentality on the pitch, I'm sure there are better vids but this was just what a quick youtube browse yielded:

What is done, is that the labia are chopped off (not excised), the clitoris is hacked away. The opening, which has now been made larger, is then sewn up (not sutured) often with twine or even straw. This is to be cut away on the matrimonial bed. 

The small opening that is left for menses is tiny, preventing it from passing in the usual way, instead it is left to stagnate and rot, causing a malodorous discharge continually. 

The girl has to spend her life smelling of rotting blood, and sex is now a painful ordeal, without any prospect of enjoyment as orgasm is impossible, since the clitoris has been removed.

Current events in Syria, just as with every conflict ever, do not have a simplistic explanation. There are religious, political, economic and social factors at play.

Likewise, it is blinkered in the extreme to assume that the people you hear of committing violent acts do so with the full support and co-operation of all Muslims. Peaceful followers of Islam are spread throughout the world - many of them are in Britain, for example, where you will note a distinct lack of governments being toppled by religious revolutionaries.

For a make-up artist on a shoot of any kind (and I mean any) the very minimum is £100/day. Film production can be tiring but it is fun.

The thing that really kills in London is rent and the fact that to get any high paying jobs as a make-up artist you'll have to do a few shoots for free just to get contacts. However if you make a few contacts it can be a comparatively handsome income. I would suggest aiming for a house share as rent can be as low as £450 and it allows you to live in nicer areas that dont have a large amount of rental accommodation. 

 A few of the other comments are indicating that if you lower your standards and aren't fussy you can pick any kind of work, this was true a few years ago but quite frankly is bullshit. I was unemployed having finished a Masters degree for most of 6 months and found that the so-called ""lower end"" retail work was more difficult to get than any other, London has a large (some migrant, I dont want it to appear I was insinuating all migrant however) permanent workforce who aim specifically to work in distinct forms of retail.  I would strongly suggest not wasting any time and go for work as a make-up artist.

Now picking where to live in London is the hard part. I'm in my early 20s so I find myself having this conversation daily with friends. I was brought up in South West London and currently living there but am moving to East London very soon, this seems to be where most young people my age are moving with a few notable exceptions. Places like Stoke Newington, Dalston, Hoxton, (parts of) Hackney and White Chapel (although only recently) are going through or have been through massive gentrification. So although they're fun to live in they have just been through a massive rent hike. The place a lot of people are moving too is Peckham, I've got to be honest its a complete dump but alot of the dispora of people who want the East End lifestyle but cant afford it are going there.

There is one Nuclear option, Brighton. Again a house share would be what to aim for. I lived there for 4 years and it was incredible. A very artsy place by the sea with great night life (just avoid the big clubs) and lots of people who work in London. You'll have to get used to the levels of homelessness, this due to the fact that many homeless aim to get to Brighton because of the weather and people have a much better community spirit (i'm not saying London doesn't have one but it can be very unforgiving). Have a read about the city and genuinely consider it.

true,borez,cnty-england,Geordie in London,"Not trying to justify the amount difference here but growing up in the North East and now living in London there's a huge difference. 

The rural North East workforce is basically commuting from small towns and villages by car to a factory, industrial estate, call center, whatever in a way that makes taking public transport pretty much unfeasible unless you want to travel on a bus two hours each way going through - and stopping at - village after village and town after town to a job that would take you 30mins by car. So most people own cars, or share lifts. They're pretty much essential up there. 

London however is a centralised hub where people commute from local ( and not so local ) surrounding areas into a concentrated area of employment that is supported by an existing transport infrastructure ( and one that takes a lot of cash to maintain. ) It's quite possible to live in London, never own a car and go about your business quite easily. I myself own a car, I use it to go shopping, for day trips and for long weekends out of London - usually up North - and nothing else. It's a luxury item, I don't need it. 

Now unless they want to completely tear up the Northern countryside with train tracks and needlessly block up the roads.  I don't ( and obviously they don't ) see how throwing money into the area will change any of this. 

I mean you could stump up billions for a Crossrail project ( where a lot of the difference in figures is coming from ) between Middlesbrough, the Toon, and Whitley Bay giving you access to a whole load of new Greggs options, but there's not exactly a lot of call for it.

true,BrokenClockwerk,lfc50,,"&gt; If you think tribalism is an important part of the sport, that's fine, but don't complain about getting downvoted because that's tribalism too.

At the end of the day, I care about my team. If United lose the title on the last day of the season to City, I'm happy about that. I'm glad they didn't win. But it doesn't make me feel better about OUR seventh place finish. Maybe this is controversial, but I would rather see United win the title and us finish fourth, than United finish second and us finish seventh.

Don't get me wrong. I love the derbies and the rivalry games. I love things like ""You're a fat granny shagger"" and ""Fuck off Chelsea FC"". I just don't think they should dominate the discourse. When United fans talk about us (or City) in otherwise unrelated comments, it's usually pretty pathetic, like they need some kind of approval that they're a better team.

There's a level of self-respect to be maintained. It's ok to say the other team outplayed you and acknowledge that, but to say congrats to their fans is stupid and pretty groveling. Similarly, you don't need to say anything positive about Rooney or Fellaini or Moyes or whomever. It's just that there's a line between ""Fat granny shagger"" and ""Fuck that cunt, I hope he gets AIDS and dies"".

And you have to acknowledge that people are going to be bitter about your banter, and that's probably how it should be. You can't have it both ways. You can't tell people to be fiercely loyal to their teams and hate their rivals, and then expect them to be cordial when you insult them and their teams. If you care about your imaginary internet points, or anything United fans are saying to you, then maybe you should keep it to yourself.

true,winter_mute,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"Yep, physically I don't think there's a comparison.

Added to that, they're both based upon barbaric cultural and religious superstitions that would be worthy of mockery if children weren't actually being damaged by these idiots.   

So I think there's some comparison to be drawn;  but you won't catch me arguing that FGM isn't physically worse. I can see how a culture that endorses male children's circumcision by allowing hospitals to perform the operation can fall prey to the perpetrators of FGM.

Culturally, male circumcision evolved for two reasons. 1) cleanliness 2) to mark out different ethnic/religious groups. Female circumcision evolved through a fear of female sexuality. If you can stop women enjoying sex, you can stop them being unfaithful, exploring their sexuality and basically gaining any sexual autonomy. They are two different things.

Personally, I've never suffered any performance issues, or suffered any loss of sensitivity (obviously I can't compare since I've grown up without a foreskin, but the women I've slept with certainly haven't mentioned that I'm taking AGES to cum. And I wank a couple of times a day and can cum very quickly if I want to). And most of my girlfriends have preferred the fact that I'm circumcised. So I really don't think it's fair to compare the removal of an inessential piece of skin with lopping off a girl's clitoris.

Now people may complain about that generalisation, that children her age can be more clear of mind than any adult and turning 16 or 18 is irrelevant but this is the best way we can think of to protect most children from being manipulated by adults.

Whilst we in the West are only aware of the 'worst' of FGM and the 'least' of MGM  as you can [see](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FEO4Jfcrznc/Taiz-K7MwAI/AAAAAAAABhY/tM8PNdnLgeE/s640/MGC-FGC.jpg) there is a full range for both genders nearly all of which are still practiced in the world, and up until the early 1900's Europe still had castrated males purely for their 'value' to classical music.

None of these procedures can be performed with 100% success, all of which risk complications and none of which can be considered anything but mutilation until the child becomes an adult and can decide for themselves. 

&gt;Male circumcision can feasibly be performed safely- it's medically quite simple.

That statement is completely false, even in the west baby boys die yearly from circumcision, are accidentally castrated etc. In the developing world they die a lot more often, as [recent events show](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/southafrica/10073918/33-men-die-in-South-African-circumcision-ceremonies.html).

Regardless, arguing over the relative severity of various procedures and competing between MGM and FGM only detracts from the main issue:

What right do parents or cultures have to mutilate their children for non medical reasons when that child is incapable of giving reasoned consent?

The answer of course is none.

The American Academy of Pediatrics said: ""Scientific research shows clearer health benefits to the procedure than had previously been demonstrated. According to a systematic and critical review of the scientific literature, the health benefits of circumcision include lower risks of acquiring HIV, genital herpes, human papilloma virus and syphilis. Circumcision also lowers the risk of penile cancer over a lifetime; reduces the risk of cervical cancer in sexual partners, and lowers the risk of urinary tract infections in the first year of life.""

No medical procedure is risk-free. Every procedure requires a balancing of risks and benefits.

In my case, as a Jewish boy I was supposed to be circumcised when I was 8 days old. But I was a small child and needed to stay in an incubator, so I wasn't circumcised until I was about six weeks old.

vs Norwich: similar to the swansea game in that we played suarez behind sturridge and had downing and hendo as wide players providing the running. NOT playing suarez hendo and downing as a front three.

vs Arsenal: Same again, hendo and downing wide, suarez and sturridge up top.

The major imbalance seems to be twofold. 

Firstly, London has a number of large infrastructure projects that aren't rivalled in scope at all in areas like Leeds: Crossrail, Thameslink and ongoing upgrades to the London Underground.

At least two of these are aimed towards getting people from neighbouring areas into London without driving, something that may well happen less in the North where options like park+ride are more available. Both Crossrail and Thameslink hit major airports: Heathrow, Gatwick and (less importantly) Luton.

The second imbalance is in population. London has a higher population: 8m vs 750k and more importantly a much higher population density: 13.5k/sqm vs 3.5k/sqm (sources: wikipedia), without including any of London's tourists that will drive those numbers higher. It's quite likely that public transport gets far more problematic with 4-5x the population density.

Excluding the major projects, spending is still a little imbalanced but looks more like £185 per head in London and the South East compared to £104 per head in the North. That's the difference in the basic service provision of things like roads and buses.",0,1372078402,null,0,false,0,cap4kfd,t3_1gyih2,t1_cap4kfd,t3_1gyih2,null,1430702461,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

For sparsely populated areas some kinds of expenditure, e.g. emergency services, have to be higher per-capita because they must be less centralised. 

The reverse is true for transport infrastructure; building projects in more densely populated areas are naturally going to impact more people and businesses, resulting  in far higher relocation/compensation costs. And that’s before you consider the cost of compulsory purchasing large patches of land in central London…

Leeds has a population density of 1,780/sq mile, while London is 13,466/sq mile (from wikipedia). Of course that isn’t hundreds of times different, but I’d expect the relationship between population density and transport infrastructure cost to be more exponential then linear.

Saying that, I actually agree with the conclusion of the report; the UK desperately needs to re-balance its economy away from London. Just looking at the numbers it should be clear that the spending required to support over-populated areas is a lot less efficient  then more spread-out cities (and that’s before you look at the social issues, such as housing costs).

He was also labeled a paedophile (which technically he isn't, post-pubescent and all that), and seems to be being lumped into the same basket as all of the serial groomers, despite their crimes being (seemingly) far more predatory and malevolent.

You have no idea how predatory or not his behaviour with this girl was. The facts are that he was in a position of power and responsibility over a *child* and he used that position to future his relationship with that *child* and engage in sexual acts with her when he knew full well that she *could not* give consent to those acts.

He went against his responsibilities as an adult and abused his responsibility as a teacher for his own gratification at the (likely) expense of the well being of a child. Regardless of deliberate grooming or manipulation it was, just like the abduction, grooming and manipulation because consent is absent. He should never have started it let alone taken the girl away from her family and ran away to France.      

&gt;Whilst he is a prime pillock for doing what he has done, I have a great sympathy for him being tarred with the same brush as those who have, to me, done far, far, worse.

I'm sorry what he did is largely the same. He raped a child, that she may have ""ok"" with that means nothing if we believe that children of that age don't have the capacity to truly make that choice. When she's older and if she reconsiders what happened are you honestly going to lessen her right to the idea she was raped because you feel sorry for someone who fundamentally abused her and his power over her?  

We know enough to pass judgment on him, more than enough, regardless of actual harm the potential for harm and the choices he made are fundamentally *dangerous* and in a horrifying selfish way.

The best example of this is acting, whereby a large number of actors spend their teens and twenties doing Shakespeare and preforming in the West End. They then get the odd job at the BBC to boost their profile before moving to the states. Consequently, they are massively overqualified compared to their american counterparts considering they are both going for the cheap, breakthrough roles. Ergo, they are more likely to do exceptionally well and make names for themselves.

As a result, when Film and Television companies in the States want high quality, experianced actors on the cheap, they hire British. See Picard, The Wire, Deadwood, House, the list goes on. Granted, when they establish themselves as a valuable asset, their pay packed increases massively, but it helps to establish them in the first place.

I'll apply it to the matches I mentioned:

Norwich - Suarez in behind Sturridge, Downing and Henderson providing the width while Lucas and Gerrard sit back.

Swansea - Same as above except swap Henderson for Coutinho.

Arsenal - Henderson was in the middle I believe, Suarez and Downing out wide with Sturridge up top.

Tottenham - You're right there, Rodgers took off a wide man to bring in a central player and sure up the midfield a bit.

The match against Reading - I was sitting in the stands for this one and Sahin was in behind Suarez, while Gerrard and Allen sat back. That day Sahin was constantly in behind Suarez to support him, whilst Sterling and Suso provided the width.

Young Boys and Chelsea were other matches I attended where the shapes and roles of players were similar.

&gt;However, even among those projects deemed by officials to be regional, there
are concerns that benefits accrue to those who are not resident in the area – this
is particularly the case in London. In his letter to the transport committee, the
transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin cited ONS Labour Force Survey estimates
suggesting that London has 800,000 ‘inward commuters’ using its transport system
and claimed that ‘once other journeys by non-residents are counted (eg business or
leisure trips, visiting tourists, people making onward travel connections), it is likely
that London transport networks serve, on a typical working day, around 1 million
users who are resident elsewhere’.

&gt;This argument has some merit, but it does not justify the current scale of the
imbalance. The issues of non-resident transport usage affect all regions and not
just London, though one would expect the issue to affect the capital city to a much
greater degree. However, even if we were to assume that 5 million non-residents
used London’s transport system on a regular basis throughout the year then
projected infrastructure spending per ‘transport user’ in London would still amount
to more than £1,500 – 10 times greater than in any region in the north and over 80
times more than in the South West. Even with the most generous estimates of non-
resident usage it is hard to see how the current scale of the imbalance can be fully

On your point about Rodgers, we've seen him buy two strikers: Borini and Sturridge. Borini is a poacher, a player whose strengths lie in his positioning and finishing. Sturridge is a little more well rounded but his strengths lie in his pace, hold-up play and finishing. I don't think either is that similar to Suarez, and that is all we have to go on for Brendan's taste in strikers. Aspas may be a striker but I don't expect to see him leading our line regularly.

I don't think Rodgers buying Benteke would be a u-turn in the slightest. The only real comparison point between AC and Benteke is that they are both big and strong. I'd argue AC is better in the air, but Benteke is a lot more well rounded, and thus could fit into a wider variety of footballing systems. Carroll only performs regularly if the team panders to him, which I don't think is the case for Benteke.

It is indeed capital spending rather than ongoing spending, but that's the least of the problems with the headline figure.

The data comes from something called the National Infrastructure Pipeline, which is a list of the biggest planned infrastructure projects in the country. This has a couple of problems:

**It biases spending figures towards large projects.**

* The NIP is a list of anticipated projects, so adding the expenditures together, you're getting ancitipated spending, with no time cutoff. Say you're comparing one large ten year project to ten smaller projects of a tenth of the size. Under this methodology, the ten year project is anticipated, so its spending is included in its entirety, whereas many of the smaller projects will still be in early stages of planning, and will not be included. 

* According to the NIP, there are only 96 anticipated transport infrastructure projects in the entire country. Projects like resurfacing or remodelling local roads would be too small to take into account.

* Even if a project is already half-way through construction, they are counting full value of the budget.

**The figures say nothing about how much public money is actually spent, .** 

* The £5 vs. £2,600 figure (giving 520 times for the headline) is for all projects which are partly funded by the public sector, but there is no information about what percentage of the money is public, and what percentage private (and to be paid back through ticket sales).

You can see these biases very clearly in the figures for London. The £2,600 figure is derived from Table 1.5, which gives total anticipated spending of £21.3 bn for London. Of this figure, £14.5 bn is Crossrail, and £5.7 bn is 'London Underground capital investment'. So of £21.3 bn London spending accounted for in this analysis, £20.2 bn is made up by two projects alone, and all other projected spending is apparently just £1.2 bn, over a period of many years. Crossrail, which makes up about 70% of London's total, is a public/private partnership, so the data takes no account of how much of the money actually comes from the government (and how much is private capital which will be recouped through ticket sales to London passengers). It also started contruction in 2009, and is currently about half-way through, yet they are counting the entire budget as anticipated spending.

The government does actually provide fully audited figures for how much public money has been spent on transport projects in various regions, and that is in another area of this report ([imgur link here](http://i.imgur.com/gRtBvTU.png)). So London gets about three times as much 'project' spending as most other regions, and the South-East gets no more than the average. This is a much better starting point for debate:

* Greater London transport infrastructure serves many more people than actually live in the smallish 'Greater London' region, both people travelling in from other regions ([this](http://geographics.blogs.casa.ucl.ac.uk/files/2012/06/GreatBritainTotalFlowsLights_Detail.png) from [UCL](http://geographics.blogs.casa.ucl.ac.uk/2012/06/21/visualising-flows-great-britain-journey-to-work/) gives a nice idea of how many people commute into Greater London for work, compare to [the map for NUTS regions of England](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NUTS_1_statistical_regions_of_England_map.svg)), and also tourists.

* Figures are for the run-up period to the Olympics, so will be skewed from the long-term average.

* London pays more tax, so should receive more money back. 

* And so on.

The difference in levels of spending does exist, and is worthy of discussion, but the headline figure above is very sensationalized. 

**Tl;dr:** The statistics are flawed; the data set was not designed to be used in this way, but rather to keep a special eye on the largest infrastructure projects to make sure they don't run over time and over budget. The government provides data [specifically for the purpose of tracking regional transport infrastructure spending](http://i.imgur.com/gRtBvTU.png), and London actually receives about three times as much as other regions, not 500 times. This is still worthy of comment and discussion.

That's the most ridiculous thing I've heard in a long time.  I'm advocating not allowing the practice on *children*.  If adults want to do this to themselves, I'm not advocating stopping them; hence it's absolutely not totalitarian.  Imposing your will on those who don't have a choice; i.e. cutting children's bodies without their consent is the very thing you seem to abhor, totalitarianism. 

However, in case you're in doubt over your terminology - from Wikipedia:

&gt;Humanism is a group of philosophies and ethical perspectives which emphasize the value and agency of human beings, individually and collectively, and generally prefers individual thought and evidence (rationalism, empiricism) over established doctrine or faith (fideism).

This is pretty much the definition of a humanist idea to be honest.  Empirically there is no value in circumcision, therefore there is no need to impose it on a child according to superstition and archaic doctrine.

However, I suspect you're simply pro-circumcision and therefore you'll run logical circles around yourself on the issue.  If you can describe *not forcing* a child to have part of their body removed as totalitarian, I don't know where we're going to go with this debate.

The basics are this, yes 16 is rather arbitrary in any given individual's development but who do you expect to be able to make the judgment on a case by case basis? You can't get the people involved to make that choice and in this case it was clear that the teacher was willing to overlook his basic responsibility to his student in favour of pursuing that relationship which inherently means trusting him to greenlight it is madness. 

The point of having an age of consent isn't about individuals but about groups, the best way to protect those that need protecting is to presume that they all do. We place the age at the point that we feel most people no longer need that protection. You are trying to apply a fanciful idea of the law to what is largely a pragmatic implementation of it.   

&gt;All I'm saying is that its a relationship that's been going on for some time.

Wait... so this was both something that was going on for some time but perfectly ok because it was only when she was just about 16? In a word, wut?

&gt;It's clear she has not been forced into thissituation. 

Nothing is clear, we don't know if she could consent and action without consent is force. You are making presumptions *for* her just like Forrest did and that is *wrong*.

&gt;Perhaps what's more damaging is everyone treating her like a child and telling her how damaged she must be to go through with it? Or trying to convince her that what she thought was love was abuse?

Society is saying ""at this age we can't be sure that you are sure"" if she remains sure as she get's older that's up to her and no one is trying to take that away from her. The issue is that no one can now be sure of the choices she'd have made as an adult if this didn't happen. Forrest took advantage of her and trying to pretend that is ok because she *might* be ok with it is horrifying.

My point is that we ultimately don't know how she will feel about this, can't know what she'd have done in a world in which he waited. The result is not matter she feels there is the potential for her to feel otherwise. Which simply means regardless of everything else what Forrester did might ultimately end up being to have raped a child and he still chose to commit that act. That's all you really need to know.

Sturridge does very little but meaningless chasing. Suarez tracks back but usually he's too far up if we lose possession. Anyone else, including Downing, on the flank isn't going to provide proper cover. 

Gerrard is going to continue losing steps and will be little help if we're about to get burned. Lucas is best as a breakup man once the attack is on the verge of scattering. He's never been able to do it all on his own.

In many ways, the two different operations under discussion could be given completely different names since they involve a biologically different procedure.

So no, just because *some of the reasons* to oppose them are the same (and they happen to use the same word along the way) doesn't mean they're exactly the same issue and can be conflated without losing information.
