People who don't want to catch awkward glimpses of boobs when they're just in there for five seconds to grab bread and milk don't have to catch awkward glimpses of boobs. People who want to buy magazines and see boobs can do that too. It's win-win. Where is the problem? What pragmatic reasons are there for not doing this? Because it's censorship and censorship is Very Bad^TM ? Is that the only reason?

It's sensitive material and we already have laws about displaying sensitive material in public places. You can't stick an 18 on in Comet to demonstrate the quality of TVs. And you can't do that for the very simple reason that we said so. Is that censorship? Is that oppression of the childless young men masses? You wouldn't want your 8 year old seeing Freddie Kruger bursting through a bed with a stomach in his hand when you're buying a new TV. Why should people even have to worry about their kids seeing computer enhanced images which give false, objectifying images of women's bodies?

Zoo and Nuts are fine and modesty bags are stupid. But Page 3? We should get rid of Page 3,' but Page 3 requires you to turn the page. Apparently boobs on Page 3 -- by default covered up on the shelf -- are wrong, but covering up boobs which are on display on the shelf is equally wrong.

true,CrashingAnalyst,eng-gloucestershire,Cheltenham,"He wasn't giving advice to the cyclist on how to cycle though, but was merely saying how the courts would use it in mitigation. 

Another way of putting it could be: ""Whilst your riding was exemplary, in this case it would be difficult to secure a conviction because of [x, y, z - not included in the article] and the mitigating factor that a typical road user would normally give way to a funeral procession"" - remember that the judge / jury aren't at the scene, all the defendant needs to say was that they were in a funeral procession (easy to prove) and the cyclist pulled in front of him 'when he wasn't expecting it'. It's idiotic but thats the courts and your 'beyond reasonable doubt'.

It's not justice per se, in the same way a victim of sexual violence might be told there's no chance of it going to court because there's no proof isn't justice. But the police have to make those choices about who they take to court. In this case with the video evidence they may well have made the wrong choice.

I might be completely wrong on this, it's difficult to tell without context, but it appeared to me that the sergeant was telling him why it wouldn't go to court rather than why he was a bad rider. The followup even says:

I'll take a lot of heat for this, and get the inevitable 'RES TAGGED AS PURITAN FAGGET!', but I hate porn. In all it's forms. I looked at it a bit as a teenager (like a month, very infrequently when I was about 16) but I didn't go very far down the rabbit hole before I realised that it was having an affect on me. I started to view women as objects, and started imagining what I could do to my teacher, or the girl I was (previously very innocently) sweet on at school. So I distanced myself from the stuff. I offer that as a disclaimer. I'm not in favour of Cameron's internet filter, but I do think that we are very lax about our approach to porn in this country. The issue, in my view, isn't our openness about sexuality, the issue is respect for sexuality. You go on the continent and the attitude is different. The only taboos you find are, ironically, aimed at glossy mags. Cabaret? Amusing. Sex scenes? Artistic. Teen sex? Normal and healthy. Lad's mags? Shit to be avoided. Walking around with flesh on display at the first sign of sunshine? You're loose. The complete opposite of what we have here.

Lad's mags give false impressions of what women should look like. And that harms women as much as it harms men. Women come to feel worthless unless they look like the (fake) models on the covers of magazines. Boys come to expect sex easily and on their terms (have you ever seen a porno which didn't involve a power fantasy where the prime recipient of enjoyment wasn't the man? Thank about that one), and feel that they deserve what's on the covers of the magazines purely because they think that's normal and that's the way it is. It's not the way it is. I've never seen a women who looks like the girls on Zoo or Nuts in real life, purely on the basis that they're all airbrushed to hell. Slimmer waists, plumper breasts, available, 'up for it', etc. It couldn't be more contrived. And that's where it parts with flesh you see on the street. That's normal. That's life.

Who cares about someone following a funeral; this is a living persons life that was put a risk by reckless and dangerous driving.

The fact that one of them has a coffin in the back does not mean that every car in this convoy is somehow magically exempt from driving safely.

It was found that some men who watched the violent porn were more likely to punish their partner. Some men were completely unaffected and punished equally whether it was violent or not.

The conclusion was that there may be a link between watching violent porn in some men, and carrying out violent acts.

Followup studies have cited that whilst the 'fired up' effect occurs in laboratory settings (for some men, not all, crucially), *there is no current evidence* that any significant number of sexual violence incidents have violent pornography as a contributing factor.

true,LordKurin,lfc99,,"So, I'm gonna follow your story up with one of my own (and to quote you, there will be a ""big twist"" to let you know why I put it as a reply to you :D)

I almost complete relate with what you are saying.  I started following Liverpool because of Torres, I saw him in the Euros in 2008 and immediately decided he was my favorite player.  Of course I followed him to his club team.  I'm not the type of person to do anything halfway, so as soon as I got here I threw myself into the history and learned about the club, the regional hatreds (Little bro tried to pull for Man U and I threatened him, then immediately bought him a Liverpool kit and starter jacket.  I refused to let him go to the darkside!), and the team/fanbases general personality.  Basically, I fell in love with the passion and history of the club.  Torres broke my heart when he left, but I was already sold.

Now, the second reason I love the passion and the history (and the twist for my Gator friend), I'm from the state of Alabama and was raised with Alabama college football.  The similarities at the time were fairly surprising to me.  Liverpool and Alabama were both historically dominant programs that had hit a ""rough patch.""  Liverpool and Alabama fanbases were both incredibly passionate and protective of their club and players.  

At the time I started following Liverpool Alabama had won one championship in ... 30 years and had one short period where it looked like we may make it back to the top, but then faltered (Liverpool winning CL 2005, coming in 2nd in league, but not really getting over the hump vs Bama in the 90s, winning a few division titles and SEC, one NC, but not really the extended periods of dominance we were used to historically).  Luckily, Alabama hired the RIGHT coach and we have currently won 3 out of the last 4 NCs.  I am hopeful (esp after Rodgers recent interviews), that this hiring turns out to be as inspired as Saban and Liverpool gets back on top where they belong.

So, Roll Tide to you /u/teganyavo!  And good luck this year against all the teams we both hate.  :D",0,1375973079,null,0,false,0,cbjibu0,t3_1jxua9,t1_cbjibu0,t1_cbjeeke,null,1429902124,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

It's the job of the police to gather evidence and take statements in order to present a case to the CPS to let them make a decision.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt; it makes sense, and i didn't consider that a 'beer garden' could be such a small space.

London has this oddity.  Often people life 10+ miles away from their mates.  Yet many will work in central London (itself about 2 miles across) which means meeting for a drink normally involves the tiny most in demand space areas for many social groups.  Many smokers I know hate the smoking shelters in some London pubs because they are so small.  Smoke in those tiny *gardens* ruins what little they had.

&gt;people who have the 'right' to comfort - (bah) are the people / groups who are spending the most money. The myth that places would be full of non-smokers was quickly disproved (iirc) when the ban came into force.

The data is hard to find, as people had been buying fewer pints for a while.  But it certainly hasn't been a massive positive:
http://www.bighospitality.co.uk/Trends-Reports/Smoking-ban-debate-still-fuming-five-years-on

However, I would say that for restaurants it has certainly been a boom.  All the ones I liked before were smoke free (as smoke doesn't stop due to an overhead sign) and ultimately I think they benefited by it being a universal ban.  I definitely am pleased the smoking ban came in, mostly for nightclubs.  The morning after I stink of stale redbull and my own man juice, this is how it should be.

&gt;what i resent is that smokers are being labelled second class citizens by people who just don't expect anyone to have manners or consideration anymore -&gt; this is where we are at, and it is wrong - and i don't know why this shift happened.

Smokers make up a minority, about 20%.  Minorities get dicked on for the *greater good*.  Ok it's simplistic, but go back to the car.  There are 5 people in it, one person wants to smoke.  So we all say, fuck you Nick!

People are quite happy to do that with beer gardens too, then so be it.  Imagine that instead of smoking, I wanted to do nothing but listen to JayZ in the garden, if you don't like it, you should choose somewhere else, I'm a paying customer!

Smokers on average earn less money
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2383197/Smokers-earn-20-non-smokers--quickly-recoup-money-quit.html
(sorry for the DM link, but it was the only non-paywalled I could find).

So if the argument comes down to spending money, it could be suggested that smokers have less of it to spend.  However I'd say for pubs, that smokers have already shown a lack of care regarding their health, they might well be more partial to drinking.  I have no data for this assertion.

However, as the trends of society are less tolerant to smokers (using the underground as a milestone for that) it is probably only a matter of time before smoking is banned in all public spaces.  As many towns do with drinking.  This is kind of a shame as I was hoping that prohibition was going to be relaxed (as the rest of the world does on weed) so knowing my luck, just about the time I'm able to pick up some dutchy original organic purple nurple to go with the fair trade king size rissla from Waitrose, I won't be legally allowed to have a nice walk along a costal path and get high on a bench.

There are plenty of Russian dash-cam videos showing people who walk into live traffic intentionally who then claim injury liability against the driver, saying they were driving irresponsibly. Indeed, that's why these Russian dash-cam videos are so prevalent because the drivers need the video evidence to defend themselves from civil prosecution.

I'm of the opinion that *a minority of cyclists* would use such biases in the system, were they introduced, to game the system and cash in on personal injury compensation claims in the courts with the help of the ambulance chasers.

(Incidentally, I don't know if this is prevalent in Russia because they have this kind of tiered ""blame system"" - forgive the phrasing, I've forgotten what this proposition is actually called - or not.

**Staff at ask.fm - the Latvian-based website where a teenager was bullied before she took her own life - have refused to tell Sky News about its system for reporting abuse.**

However, those who last to the end of the article discover:

&gt; But the worker said the correspondent should speak to an official from the company.

and

&gt; Ask.fm has called her death a ""true tragedy"" and said it is cooperating with Leicestershire Police's investigation.

And yet you accuse people of jumping to assumptions? I don't smoke anymore, my girlfriend quit before I met her, I only know a handful of people who smoke in my friendship group.

Just because you approach things in a way that serves you interest (as someone who seems to detest smoking and smokers) doesn't mean everyone is. Many people don't like smoking and are against it in confined public spaces, both smokers and non-smokers, however people smoking in a beer garden is not damaging to your health so you'll just have to soldier on through that awful smell like most people do. Perhaps you should focus on things that hare actually harmful and damaging to society as a whole rather than something that is down to personal preference. 

If I didn't like the smell of beer would you tell me not to visit a pub or that pubs should ban beer? Pubs are traditionally a place to eat, drink, socialise and smoke; smoking in doors caused health problems so was reasonably banned. Smoking outdoors does not pose a significant health risk and is therefore down to personal preference, not what is best for society as a whole. PLEASE explain to me how what you want is more valid than allowing non-smokers a smoke free enviroment and smokers a place to smoke.

Smoking does not cause harm to others outdoors, unless you spend 24/7 at the pub sat next to a smoker then it might be harmful (still significantly less than smoking in doors) and if you do then the amount of alcohol you would be consuming would be signifcantly more damaging tha nthe small amount of passive smoke you get outdoors.

You seem to misunderstand that a lot of the problem passive smoking causes is because it's in a confined space so the smoke filled air is repeatedly breathed in. Whereas outdoors the air is incapable of becoming anywhere near as saturated. 

You refuse to engage in any of the arguments people make and just insult them and call them unfair. ",0,1375974647,null,0,false,0,cbjiw10,t3_1jxzx9,t1_cbjiw10,t1_cbjfrcl,null,1429901862,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

1) the floorboards in the bathroom affected and hallway immediately outside the door need replacing, as they suffered from continual water going through them for nearly a month, and have sat in the same condition for two months since.  

2) the flooring itself in the bathroom needs fully replaced (DynoRod had to lift it to try and identify where the water was coming from

3) the carpet (nice axminster one) in the hallway leading to the bathroom has been heavily stained and rotten

4) the ceiling in the living room never bowed, its a new build (completed 2007) and the water once it went over a certain point poured through gullies in the area between the lower and upper floors.

5) my original bathroom suite has been ruined.

between those, thousands is a reasonable estimate - but to be clear, I dont want compensation, all I wanted was them to come in and fix the damage they caused.

true,majormantastic,staffordshire,Staffordshire,"I absolutely agree it would be horrendously expensive to put every case through court. However, ultimately it's for the CPS to decide what what cases are pursued or not and theoretically not the police's decision. The problem is if you take the stance of not taking minor cases to court because the cost is too high (even if a conviction is given) then where is the disincentive for people to not go around assaulting anyone they disagree with?

My experience has come from being personally assaulted on my way home from work (and harassed afterwards for involving the police) and from my parents who themselves are recently retired police officers.

Unfortunately it seems that some cases are dropped before any simple investigation has taken place. I know in my case the police didn't bother taking statements from my friends who I ran to (pursued by the guy who attacked me), they also didn't photograph injuries that I had sustained. This is basic stuff that should be done before decisions are made and if these procedures aren't followed then this is a failing of the system. There is a skill to building a portfolio of evidence and developing this skill by doing these basic policing tasks is important to making a good police officer.

In my case my parents (and other colleagues) saw that there was definitely sufficient evidence that could be amassed to convict the guy but we actually had to pressure the sergeant of the investigating officer to get something done and had to wait for him to go on holiday and his replacement to come in to do anything about it. What I'm saying is that the police may give an explanation of why they don't pursue something but you receive this in good faith that what they're saying is true and they've done a good job.

Of course, police officers are different to one another and ultimately some will do a ""good"" job ad some will do a ""bad"" job. However, imposing cuts on policing and pressure to achieve targets produces a system that tends to favour the ""sweep everything under the carpet"" approach.

The guy was convicted by a magistrate in the end by the way; I got £250, the courts got £250 and he got a large community service order. I think he's in prison for something else now, he was well known to the police before me. As a side note it still amazes me how many cases are ruled on by volunteer unpaid magistrates.",0,1375976273,null,0,false,0,cbjjhvg,t3_1jy504,t1_cbjjhvg,t1_cbjivkz,null,1429901580,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Trust me, if it weren't for all the media and fans going *on and on and on* about the trophy drought I'm sure we'd be very happy about Arsenal at the moment. 

And the 8 year drought is completely irrelevant in judging whether we can or can't win trophies. That logic is stupid. Would you say Wigan have a better chance of winning trophies than Man City because they've won a trophy sooner?

All I know is, Arsenal are the 4th best team in the country and therefore have a decent chance of winning trophies in the future. And as I've already said, Wenger has guarenteed on us being a top club for decades by building a stadium and qualifying for the Champions League.

I definitely grew up with the internet and phones and social media as a huge thing when I was in secondary school, so I can only imagine how much more ingrained these things are now. 

The thing is, for kids now the internet and communicating like that is a huge part of friendships and how they live their lives. Not joining in with it all can leave you more ostracised in itself. I know my cousins (13 and 14) constantly Facetime each other and spend all the time they're together talking about what friends etc. are posting on Facebook. It is undeniably a HUGE part of kids' lives now.

I was also bullied in school, and some of that was via the internet and phone (texts). Its difficult because all the name calling and shoving I got stopped when I was home. Text messages to my phone and messages online meant I couldn't even talk to my friends while I was at home without risking seeing other things that weren't nice. 

And, kids are devious. If you're quite the popular target for bullies (as I was), its really nothing for them to set up a new fake account and start using that to carry on.

But because of attitudes like yours above, I assumed (possibly rightly) that no one would take any of that, and the hurt it caused me, seriously. 

And you really can't take a child's mistakes and use it to blame them for getting bullied. Maybe the fault there is with the bully, for... being a bully?

true,nooope_,null,null,"&gt;Joe Cole is a similar type of players to Hazard. These kind of players tend to use the ball alot and when they are in top form, those touches looks easy to the eye and are useful in making plays.

Difference being Hazard actually being good at it.

&gt;That's why he won player of the year 

No, he won player of the year because he was spouting shit about being a lifelong Chelsea fan and performing fairly well for half the season in a season that didn't have any real stand out players except for Ricky, but performing impeccably for the whole season isn't as impressive as talking about being a lifelong Chelsea fan while performing well for half the season according to the ~~sheep~~ fans, and that's why he won Player of the Year. Had it purely been a question about the best player of the year always winning player of the year then he wouldn't have won it.

&gt; wouldn't you say Hazard could have won that award this year too?

No, anyone picking Hazard over Mata last season would just prove that they're new to the sport and lacking any knowledge of it whatsoever. Mata was by far the best player last season, and it wasn't even close.

&gt;Baseless bullshit about Kalou from a man that clearly never watched him play for Chelsea.

Yeah, no.

&gt;If you watch some replays, you will see that 80% of them time if they have the ball, they push it down the side a little before cutting into the middle and shoot.

Except Joey has got a higher shot/game average than Kalou. Oh, and Kalou provided more assists than Joey.

Using actual facts is fun!

true,withabeard,,Pint of best - with a top if it's hot.,"This may or not help. But it's almost certainly not that life kicks you that hard all at once.

It's just that, all the bad things are often linked and compound each other. Also, people only seem to really notice their problems at their breaking point.

1. Lifes been hectic lately (linked to [2], [5] and [6])
2. shitty health (downward spiral with [3])
3. stress (downward spiral with [2], linked to [5]?)
4. harassment by fucking Atos (making [1] and [3] worse)
5. girlfriend problems (linked to [1] and [3]?)
6. Brother making shit hard (linked to [3] and [1])

Looking at that, take almost any of those (single) things out and all the other get easier to manage at once.


[1] can often be helped to some degree by mates. But generally it'll not go away, so lets ignore it. [2] can't be fixed easy, again I'll ignore it. Hopefully you're getting the professional attention you need and it'll not have too much impact on [1].

[3] is a key one to get worked out. Find the help you need to fix it. If you need to talk to a stranger (you're bringing it up on a public forum and strangers like me are responding) and vent, then consider talking to a therapist. There'll almost certainly be some volunteers locally that'll take your woes to ear. Sounds like it'll do the world of good.

[4] Shit sucks, hopefully someone with more experience dealing with them can help. Sorry, I'm no use there.

[5] Spend some time enjoying bachelorhood :) Starting relationships don't seem to work when you're not already in the right place. So ẁorry about it all when you're in a better place.

[6] Sounds like it's worth talking to your parents. See if there is anything they can do about your brother. Then stop worrying about it. I do mean that, when you find yourself thinking about him being a douche or worrying about him take a mental note and think actively about something else.

I take your point though and comparisons to Hitler may sound a bit hysterical but I find the idea that you can't ever compare events to Hitler because they'll never be as bad a bit silly also. We might as well forget the whole history of the Nazi regime if we can't use it as a warning for the future. That's the purpose that history serves in my eyes and while making too many comparison's might dilute the power of it, I think it's more appropriate here than most other places it's used. 

If people can't take the Nazi stuff seriously then they can ignore it. The fact is that gay people are being persecuted, murdered and arrested. I think Fry's point is proved simply by that fact and simply on those facts the IOC should look carefully at whether it wants to go into 2014 having said nothing about this issue. They could at least wholly condemn it and say to Russia that any interference with games or arresting of athletes will result in their calling off. 

Perhaps Fry goes to far to say they should definitely be held somewhere else but the IOC should at least indicate that they don't think it's a perfect state of affairs.

Probably take some flak for this because it's a suicide, but if you cut through the emotive it seems like a pretty clear case of parents not knowing what their kids are doing and are looking for someone to blame.

15 years ago when I went to school there was a case where a girl was being quite seriously bulled over MSN messenger to the point the Police got involved. So this is nothing new. And it's not as if this is the only website on the planet where people can interact with each other. Bullying can happen through many different mediums. SMS, BBM, Forums, Reddit.... Picking on a single site because it happens to be used by young impressionable kids is pathetic. And how many suicides were linked to MySpace?

The problem is not a particular site, the problem is completely unfettered access to social media by children who are not mature enough to understand just how terrible some people can actually be. As a child you don't know any better and this sort of bullying may well seem relentless in the age of smart phones and 24x7 access to the internet.

So what happened next?

He got sacked, but why? Didn’t he win a trophy at Liverpool? Isn’t that what football is all about? Well apparently not. The owners at Liverpool saw something else. They saw a fortune spent on a 6th &amp; 8th placed finishes. The trophy to them didn’t matter that much and who would blame em? You get more money for qualifying in the champions league than winning the carling cup and to make matters worse Liverpool finished below Everton for the first time during the PL era.  So it shouldn’t surprise anyone that they had to sack him when they allegedly asked him to put himself in the fans shoes. Liverpool were looking towards the future.

I feel what we have done in the last 8 years will allow us to compete for trophies for decades to come. I am optimistic and confident that we will be one of the best teams in the country without a sugar daddy, and what more can you ask than that?

true,ChelseaAWAY,EN,england,"&gt; The first most obvious reason relates to the amount of money needed to secure this deal, it will require a £200,000 a week four year deal and a possible £30million+ transfer fee. With the financial fair play restrictions coming round the corner, this could be costly, in addition, there are probably some players such as Cole, Torres and Hazard that have conditions in their contracts regarding 'match the highest paid player at the club' (Terry and Lamps were bumped up to 170k when Torres joined apparently).

I'm pretty sure the club know more about FFP than anyone else so if it was such a big deal we wouldn't be trying to go through with this transfer.

&gt; Many people feel that Rooney's best position is behind the striker, not only do we have Hazard, KDB, Mata and Oscar for that position but Mata and Hazard are better than Rooney in that role anyway.

Rooney's best position is up front. 26 League goals in the 09/10 season, 27 in 11/12. 12 last season and he wasn't playing in his favored position.

&gt; Lukaku will certainly be one of the worlds greatest in a couple of years time and he is easily annoyed. Sitting behind Torres, Drogba and Sturridge angered him somewhat in his first season at Chelsea and i feel that giving him a lot of game time this year would be more beneficial in the long run for chelsea as he will become that world-class player quicker than if he is sitting behind Rooney and Torres in the pecking order.

Lukaku CAN'T lead us on all fronts this season, yes he had an amazing season last season but people seem to forget when teams play West Brom they mostly go out and attack leaving space for Lukaku to work in. When teams play us they sit back with 10 men behind the ball. No doubt Lukaku will become great in the next few seasons but not at the moment.

&gt; Even if Rooney scored a hattrick on his Chelsea debut the English media would be asking questions as to whether 30mil is too much for a striker only managing a goal every 30mins. We would soon have another Torres fiasco where our new signing is the only thing talked about, i personally hated beating a team convincingly with style and seeing that the only thing the newspapers commented on was that Torres didnt score.

You're over exaggerating here to much.

EDIT: Rooney is an excellent player and would pretty much complete our team, why do you think all the pundits are saying we need to bring in another striker? Because Lukaku isn't the finished article yet, Torres... well 1 League goal in 2013 says enough and Ba although he's good he can't lead us to the title or the CL.",0,1375978557,null,0,1375979565,0,cbjkec8,t3_1jymz2,t1_cbjkec8,t3_1jymz2,null,1429901158,19,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,19

Then that team that everyone thought was mediocre won 29 of the final available 33 points to secure fourth place. A great achievement no matter what you think.

If you had done that over Everton, my lord I am 100000% certain you would have done the same thing. 

[Here's a picture. It's Michael Dawson after Gareth Bale put Spurs ahead, and keep this in mind: he erroneously thought Newcastle had equalized against us, meaning that goal had put them into fourth.] (http://cdn0.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1614395/BKp8D-wCYAAFI4X.jpg).

That's how much UCL football means to players, especially if it's at your biggest rivals expense. And my point was, I feel we have a brighter future and a better chance than winning trophies than Liverpool in future. I'd rather be in Arsenal's position at the moment than Liverpool's.

Our expectations and goals for the next 20 years will be to win trophies and get into the Champions League every season.

well nothing is for certain for one thing, another is IN A COUPLE OF YEARS - Chelsea need results now, not in a couple of years. Waiting a couple of years is the gunner mentality, look how thats been working out.

It will. As far as I know there's no such thing as a licence that only permits On sales -- all pubs can sell for consumption on or off the premises.

However the outdoor seating doesn't count as ""off"" the premises -- if it's still part of the pub's property then it's on the premises as far as the law is concerned. This is one reason why a lot of pubs without beer gardens, e.g. in town centres, clearly delineate the smoking/seating area outside the pub using rope barriers or similar. If the barrier coincides with the bit of the pavement that legally belongs to the pub then as long as the smokers don't go beyond that barrier while carrying a pint, no laws are broken.

And using social media to bully someone can Severely increase the harm caused due to it being pervasive away from 'normal' areas I bullying like at school.

If you're bullied at school you look forward to getting home. You can make it into your samctuary and escape from it all for the evening or the weekend. You can get out with friends outside of school who make you feel better. 

With social media that safe place can very quickly shrink. 

You want to talk to your friends on Facebook? You might suddenly find yourself being harassed by a bully who found your from school. 

You want to have a fun Q&amp;A session with your friends on ask.fm? Your bully finds out and you are suddenly being harassed there. Not only that but those harassment a are getting forwarded to your email account just to remove another safe place from you. 

You want to be able to talk to your friends by texting them? Your bully gets your number and is sending you hurtful messages constantly or constantly trying to phone you to sneer at you down the phone.

Even if you try and stay away from those sites so they can't do it to you, or you block them, they can still contact your friends or school mates and bully you through them by spreading rumours or lies. Turning your friends against you.

So your solution is to just go away and avoid the technology? You end up becoming a social outcast because everyone else is so engrained into the technologically pervasive world and if you're not there you're just the sad loner nobody likes.

That adds one more thing for the bullies to hurt you with. Only this one hurts the most. Because its actually true. You feel like the sad liner. You don't feel safe enough to be like everyone else. You feel like maybe if they're right about that maybe they're right about the other things they're saying. Maybe you are worthless. Maybe you are a waste of space.

true,LordKurin,lfc99,,"There is a huge difference between the EPL and the German or Spanish leagues.  Bayern can stay at the top because none of the other clubs can compete with their financial and cultural muscle.  The vast majority of the german players want to play for Bayern.  It's the same in Spain.  There are two rich clubs, and the rest are also-rans.  The best players want to play at those two clubs.  In England you have 3 teams that will be even or better (ManU, Chelsea, Man City) financially and two clubs that are very close financially(Liverpool and Tottenham, tottenham further away than Liverpool).  (Source! http://sportandbrands.wordpress.com/2013/01/24/top-20-football-clubs-by-income-season-201213-deloitte-football-money-league-report-2013/)  There are 6! clubs that (turnover-wise) make top 3 income for any league in the world except the one they are in.

As far as culturally, ManU occupies the top spot..below that there is much debate but for the sake of arguement most would agree that Arsenal, Livepool, and Chelsea would be a level below as far as global support, so no particular advantage there to Arsenal.  Man City will prob have a huge fanbase in a year or two as well simply because of bandwagon jumpers.

Anyway, the point of this long disertation is basically that (IMO) you should be able to stay competitive (but no more competive than 5 other teams), but once Arsene leaves I don't see you able to maintain top 4 every year as you have been.  And (as we Liverpool fans know) once you miss CL a few years in a row it's MUCH harder to get back in.",0,1375979236,null,0,false,0,cbjko73,t3_1jyk8w,t1_cbjko73,t1_cbjjxga,null,1429901029,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

I'm not too worried about the FFP ramifications and  highly doubt anyone's salary would be getting bumped up.  Hazard is probably already on ~175k/w, as is Torres and I doubt Cole is too far behind.  I can't imagine any Chelsea players have gotten a match highest earner clause since those two (if they did), that just wouldn't make sense for a club like us.

2.  Rooney would play as a striker, end of story.  I'm not sure who ""many people"" is.

3.  Lukaku easily annoyed?  Angered his first season?  Where are you getting this from?  Lukaku seems a consummate professional and has already said he'd welcome Rooney to the team.  He might have been frustrated by his first season with us (dumb AVB playing him that one game).  Lukaku is not going to be behind Torres in the pecking order whether we get Rooney or not.

4.  That's not a reason not to get him and has nothing to do with actual football.

5.  You can't say that when you don't know how Rooney will perform.  For all you know he could light it up and the media will heap praise on us for such a brilliant move and oh how dumb United must feel.

Now we might not win anything?  Lukaku is injured?  Rooney would be a media-focused panic buy?

The decreased number in the past season may have been in part because Anzhi brought in Ivorian Giant Lacina Traore (who scored 18 league goals), consequently Eto'o's assist total went up this past season, and were comparatively high among other players at Anzhi. 

Eto'o was also the fourth highest scorer in the RPL for the 12-13 season.

**In terms of other qualities...**

While some people would argue that Russia is not as competitive England, and UEFA (or FIFA, I think it's UEFA) ranks this accordingly I would say that Russia is a pretty gnarly league to play in. General Winter aside, Anzhi is the furthest south out of all Russian teams. Travel alone is pretty exhausting - 4,000 KM to Zenit, 1,700 KM to Moscow for starters. Not to mention league cup games where you're playing a team in Yekaterinburg (Anzhi did, and played until the final where they lost) and have to travel 2,500 KM midweek to do so.

My point is that English football might be more competitive but I'd argue that Russian football is definitely more *grueling* for the RPL's big teams. If that doesn't score you at least some quality points, idk.

Eto'o's resilience hasn't really wavered in his time away from the big European football. He's  been Anzhi's captain for the past year and a bit and has emerged as an effective leader.

You could also look at the fact that Eto'o plays in some shitty conditions. He's been the target of racial absue in Italy as well as [Spain](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go_z3GTmUQI). Despite this he's playing in Russia (I know he's not living there and he's collecting a massive paycheque but still). He's playing in a region (Dagestan) where there's active Islamic insurgency, separatism, ethnic tension, and racism. Not to mention he plays all over Russia in places like Grozny, and even Zenit where [the largest fan group doesn't want black players in the RPL](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20770678).

There's also pedigree. Eto'o wins silverware wherever he's been since he left Mallorca in 04', and he's played under Jose before at Inter. Anzhi is the exception to this but they weren't exactly a jewel of a club when he joined back in 2011 - they were a mid-table side that came into money and were trying to buy themselves into contention for a RPL title, they've done this to some extent rising from 11th prior to Eto'o's arrival, to 8th, and then 3rd under his captaincy and coming 2nd in Russia's national cup.

**So is Eto'o a quality player still?**

At 32, yes. Drogba is 35 and still shitting on Arsenal even though he's playing in Turkey and scoring goals left and right in the SuperLig.

Eto'o would be a great gap measure for our strikers, and could easily put goals in the back of the net. Under Mourinho he flourished at inter scoring 37 goals overall in a single season. Who's to say lightning can't strike twice? He's also never won silverware in England, for a striker like him that could be easy motivation.

He's tough, he's capable, and he's an effective leader.

Assuming we could capture him for (far) less than Rooney, I'd say sign him up.

Have clubs really been crippled by the smoking ban? Its very hard to say, a lot more has happened since 2007 than just banning smoking, alcohol tax has increased massively while supermarkets have cut their profits on alcohol and continued to reduce prices, also there's been a recession so that kind of makes people think about going for the cheaper options...

Ultimately, smoking is really stupid, yes, its ok when you're addicted to it, but there is no way that making it easier for people to smoke is a good thing and ultimately, if you carry on smoking you'll almost certainly die from it to be honest, you should hope you do, because lung cancer is the best way to go, if you get emphysema or tongue or throat cancer first, that's when things really turn to shit a tongue amputation is no laughing matter.

I agree that Parker is a great influence but for £3m+ in salary i think i would rather we gave playing time to a younger (cheaper) talent in cups, Jake (not my first choice by any means) cover cover DM in the Cap 1 cup if need be plus we will need to heavily rotate our squad as is to get them all playing time and thats without Parker counted. .  Plus i would hope that between Dawson, Jan, Hugo and the others we would have enough people to step up and be leaders in the clubhouse.

Way i look at it is this say we get £3m for Parker and £5m for THudd (another player i love but we can certainly move) that frees up about £12m between transfer fee and salary on our books.  for £12m plus any other outgoings and what may be left in our transfer pot we can go make either a couple smart signings or be on our way to a pretty substantial signing. Want to chase a younger striker option to backup Soldado? Just Thudd and Parker free up a solid amount towards that... Parker alone would just about cover a deal for Vlad Chirches.

I want to add that both Gylfi and Holtby have skill sets that are a bit different from Dembele and Paulinho.

It's burying it. Stopping a single avenue of its expression rather than dealing with it. It's a problem with people. It's a problem with society.

I think Oviedo is more than capable of filling in for Baines over the season - he's young, pacy and confident. Plus Distin &amp; Garbutt can potentially back him up. Not to mention with the rise of Coleman and Mirallas, we aren't as dependent on the left side as we used to be during the peak of the Bainaar days. 

On the other hand, with Neville and Hitz gone, Fellaini is one of the few PL-quality central midfielders we have - Gibson and Osman being the others (Barkley too...someday).

You will find that a Constable's job is to gather the available evidence and present it. Police Supervisors have to ""gatekeep"" every job and direct it appropriately

A supervisor (usually sergeant) will look at the available evidence and the public interest and assess whether there is a realistic prospect of conviction. If there isn't, then it will be NFA without need to go to the CPS.

It's never a laziness thing, it's sometimes a money thing at police level if there are disproportionate costs involved in the investigation (£105 to send an item for DNA analysis); if you're dealing with a low level assault like pushing, the benefit to having that done does not make it worth spending the public money. When you consider ""we brushed past each other"" is a perfectly good defence, the test is useless.

It's not about the Police overstepping a boundary into the courts, it's about being sensible and pragmatic so the courts don't become overloaded with shite.

That doesn't change the fact that when you give ALL the power to the employers, whose interests do not coincide with the wellbeing of their employees, a great many, if not most, will exploit them.

There is nothing in the nature of zero hour contracts that stops employers abusing their employees, and leaving them in an incredibly precarious state, taking advantage of them, forcing them to work in unacceptable conditions, because their ability to provide or deny work is absolute. Part time contracts with guaranteed hours do prevent this, because the employer lacks the ability to deny work at random and at will.

Trusting every manager to just be a good guy, even when it will often go against the businesses bottom line is hopelessly naive.

All of the good things you mention with your job had nothing to do with being on a zero hour contract. Businesses have taken on summer employees on part time hours for generations. What you described is no different from my casual summer job at a park as a teen where I had some set hours, but could work more. All the things you mentions as positives, not one of them had anything to do with being zero hour.

What they haven't done is kept their entire workforce on call 24/7,  which is what these contracts have facilitated.

Against weaker sides (i.e. the teams that tended to park the bus against us last season) I think we'll field 2 of our 3 big guys (4, again if we do sign Capoue) and one of either Holtby, Sig or Carroll to give us someone who can play the cheeky pass to split open the opposition defense. 

As for our front three, we'll hopefully primarily be using Soldado with two of either Bale, Lennon, Chadli and Townsend. What I like about our four wingers is that they all possess different qualities, which will be very difficult for opposition teams to prepare against. Lennon can give us pace and width, Chadli has technique and an eye for goal or the killer pass, Townsend is very athletic with a shot on him, and Bale needs no further comment. 

All in all I think the player material we have now in midfield and up top gives us many alternative ways of playing 4-3-3, in that it gives André a tactical versatility I think we lacked last season. Facing a 4-3-3 with Dembele, Sandro, and Paulinho + Bale, Soldado and Chadli is a whole different game compared to facing Sandro, Paulinho, and Siggy + Bale, Soldado and Lennon for example.

I have serious reservations about whether any meaningful, relevant cultural differences are to be found between a con artist with some low cunning in Russia and a con artist with some low cunning in Britain. They're both likely to be out for a quick buck at someone else's expense, with the minimum amount of effort on their part. It's almost guaranteed that someone would try it on having gotten the idea from watching YouTube clips. I don't think the point can be entirely dismissed.

&gt;You cannot, and should not, build a system around the people who might abuse it or the ways in which they might.

In principle, I agree. You should not build a system with the express purpose of negating the ability to game it. All systems can be gamed, no matter how well designed, but there should be some checks and balances to mitigate an individuals ability to game the system. However, this isn't my primary objection to the proposed ""blame tiers"". I was merely illustrating one potential way in which such a system could be abused.

I'm opposed, generally, to the imposition of a pattern of thinking that makes assumptions about the guilt, or liability, of one party in an incident involving a motor vehicle and a pedal cycle. Upholding the principle of, ""innocent until proven guilty"", to put it more concisely.

I think that the police should be allowed to conduct their investigation without prejudice and the courts to reach an opinion on a series of event based on testimony and evidence without prejudice. This forms the foundation of the checks and balances I alluded to earlier, no party can be assumed to be in the wrong until enough evidence is amassed to indicate the strong likelihood that they were at fault.

There will inevitably be road users, in charge of motor vehicles, who hate cyclists and there are provably a number of them who are actively hostile towards cyclists and, with some luck, they have been outed and dealt with by the relevant authorities. Similarly most cyclists I've seen ride responsibly and keep aware of their surroundings but there are undoubtedly a few out there in the world who are a danger to themselves and to others. Mollycoddling them and allowing them to think that they are always in the right is the wrong way to treat people if you want them to be responsible for their own actions.

Treating everyone on an even playing field and allowing the police to do their jobs without interference is, in my opinion, the fairest way to deal with things when they occur.

true,formercedric,lincolnshire,Lincolnshire,"Right at the start of the video, this bloke says internet feminists resort to draconian measures to shield themselves to new ideas. He uses a screen cap of Anita Sarkeesian's video about tropes vs women in computer games (a fiendish lady who had the audacity to turn off comments on her videos) as if it's some sort of crime against humanity. It isn't as if every single bellend on reddit with a bee in his bonnet isn't debating her videos and how much of a bitch they think she is. And any way, I was led to believe she chose not to have comments on that series because the comments she received before weren't very good.

[Here are some of them](http://www.feministfrequency.com/archive/YouTube_Harassment_2hours.jpg)

Maybe if she doesn't want those death and rape threats and generally arseholish misogynistic comments on her page it doesn't necessarily mean she hates the free exchange of ideas or whatever, it simply means she isn't a masochist.

As far as the banbot goes I suppose that's a pretty shitty thing, but that doesn't seem to be the main thrust of the argument.

And is he complaining that the BBC used a silly voice for the ""troll""? What, does he think what the troll had to say was worthwhile? That the quoted troll isn't somehow an unbelievably massive cockend? Hang on a minute, is not wanting to expose yourself to these massive bellends whose only goal is to annoy people for shits and giggles part of the argument for ""closing yourself off to ideas you don't like""? This video is starting to get fucking flimsy with its arguments.

And then it's on to some lady called Rebecca Watson, and he says using ""elevatorgate"" as an example of the abuse women get online is ridiculous. Err, hang on a minute, didn't that whole thing lead to her getting all sorts of [death and rape threats](http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2012/10/sexism_in_the_skeptic_community_i_spoke_out_then_came_the_rape_threats.html) too? I mean, regardless of whatever started the whole kerfuffle (I'm led to believe she grumbled about a bloke hitting on her in a lift, and err, so? My wife grumbled about being hit on in the gym the other day too, what's the big deal?), isn't legions of wankers ending death and rape threats to women online _not_ an absolutely pertinent example of the abuse women get online? What the hell is this guy smoking?

And then he's banging on about how outrageously arrogant and massively self-centred she is for saying that all men in the universe have to change their entire lives according to her whim. Err, yeah whatever mate. Sounded like she was giving her opinion and a bit of advice for when and when not to hit on girls you like if you ask me. But all right, let's have it your way. Let's say she really is an arrogant shedevil who wants all men in the universe to defer to her judgement at all times because she hates freedom. Does this necessarily mean it's now _all right_ that she got all those death and rape threats? What sort of wanky argument is that? This bloke is really starting to get on my tits. 

And so now he's back to grumbling about the banbot again. Well, seems legit. I had a look over his twitter feed and didn't see any outrageous wankery there. So I'm willing to believe that including him on this list is probably a bit unfair; and almost certainly an example of its creator being either too zealous or, just as he argues, too closed off to new ideas. All right, so it looks like his complaint about Newsnight's reporting looks to be legitimate. It's a shame I had to put up with nine and a half minutes of unreconstructed bullshit to get to his legitimate gripe, though.

And then from there he launches into a tirade about how these women encourage all the vitriolic hate and abuse so as to deviously further their mastermind plans of sociopathic self-centred self-aggrandizing ego-trip of self-victimisation... oh for fuck's sake this bloke is such a massive twat I can't even get my head around it.

So yes it does represent censorship, censorship wearing a cute babies bonnet and just the cutest little dress but it's still censorship!  Besides which if the Co-Op do not want to carry those magazines then the Co-Op or any other retailer is free to not carry them.   If there are sufficient people like yourself who do not wish to see such magazines (both the male and female version) then advertising you do not carry them would attract customers.   Similar sort of thing to the backlash over Indian call centres.

But I do strongly doubt there are enough of you to make it worth any large chain of stores effort to cancel the orders with the distributors.

However, players come and go all the time.  Cristiano went to Real, did Man U fans hate him?  They applaud him whenever he features in Champions League against them.  There are only players who leave their club in such a way that seems malicious or unappreciative - Lebron, Terrell Owens, Suarez, Ashley Cole, Nasri, Adebayor - that are seen as villains.  It isn't because of the fans' love and praise, it's the fact that it was seemingly unrequited.  This is basically condemning the idolization of players.

Fellaini is REAL good, but Baines is world-class. So many chances created and marks well. Lots of midfielders to choose from, and just that I honestly don't think Fellaini's price tag will EVER be higher than hovering around 30. Twice what we paid for him, and I think we'll be okay if we don't replace him until January if that happens.

We have Gibson, Osman, Barkley, Junior, and Lundstram and Green if we need to tap into that. It would definitely throw the last two straight into the prem. I think Martinez has done his homework and has concrete solutions to anything that happens.

Suarez does not want to go to Arsenal to win trophies, he wants to go there so he can attract higher pedigree clubs whilst he plays in the UCL for some reason. He wants to play UCL football more than win Carling and FA cups for some reason.

But don't bring up this ""winning"" thing up again. If Suarez really wants to join Arsenal it's not because he wants to win cups but because he wants to play UCL football for a year or two before he goes to Madrid or Bayern (albeit strange).

Because FSG wanted to bring in an owner to whom they wouldn't be beholden.  Kenny was too much of a legend for them to be able to exercise the kind of guidance/control over the club that they wanted.  Intra-club politics led to Dalglish's sacking as much as a failure to make top four.

This is a stupid non-sequiter.  Of course both Liverpool and Arsenal have a bigger chance of winning trophies than Wigan, that's a no-brainer.

Shankly transformed Liverpool into an entity of it's own, a strong one at that. WWSD: what would Shankly do in this situation? I think he would make an example of Suarez to not only motivate the fans that Liverpool FC comes first, but to emphasize to the players that no individual is bigger than the club. 

I fear we are losing our identity over time and have to play nice in order to please others who are not Liverpool supporters. Fuck them, I want us to do well, I want Liverpool to be strong above anything else, I want joy for those who fill the stadium at every home game. 

People keep saying that if Suarez rots in the Liverpool reserves it would be a waste for LFC. But what do we lose really? I don't see Suarez playing for us again so we've already lost that. We would get a low ball money such as 30mil from foreign clubs because of Suarez's antics or strengthen our rival and get 45m+. Has money been an issue with our new owners? Not really. If Johhn Henry says he won't let Suarez go, probably means we are just dandy on the money front. So, what do we gain if Suarez gets stuck in Liverpool limbo? Integrity. A big wake up call to our players who are getting too self involved. We once again become that Shankly unit, that Liverpool entity which emphasis the survival and well being of the club above everything else.

The situation occurred because they had allowed a large gap to develop between their car and the procession (which, as I said above, was tearing down the road), and it was their sense of entitlement that instead of being patient for a few seconds more, and allowing a vulnerable road user to complete a maneuver he had already initiated, they just steamed through.

true,bornhowling,num18,,"This is not what you asked but anyway, some context to our academy.

Ten - fifteen years ago our academy produced the two best central defenders in the country. First out was Sol Campbell, a strong and brilliant player. Captain of the club at a young age. He ran his contract down claiming he was going to renew it but instead he signed on for Arsenal. It's one of the most infected transfers in football history and he will never be forgiven.

Everyone at the club is miserable when in Campbell's place steps Ledley King. An even better player, more graceful, speedy, brilliant reading of the game. A word class player, through and through. King goes on to captain the team but chronic knee injuries means that he never gets to play as much as he wants and when he does play he is hindered by them. He stayed at the club his whole career finally retiring last summer. Legend.

After Campbell and King we produced no good players for years and years. Until Caulker. The academy defender a lot of us hoped would fill King's shoes. Caulker shone wherever he went on loan, no matter division. Even though he looked a little nervous last season and had some so and so games, we all thought he would stay.

We have two first team players who has come through our academy. Jake Livermore, but let's be honest he won't ever hold down a starting position at this club. He is a decent bit part player. And Tom Carroll who is more interesting since he is a brilliant passer and a really promising midfielder.

true,mushroomgodmat,null,null,"note - what you are talking about I think is strict liability. This does not equal blame, only specifies who should compensate who which is normally an insurance problem not a driver/personal problem. Oh - and this only works if there is no witnesses/obvious proof to say otherwise. 

It makes a surprising amount of sense, even though it can seem very unfair. It would speed up compensation (by in some case years). The cost of such a scheme would benefit everyone as it would pay for itself in the time and paper work saved VS the current system. As yet Iv not read any article from any insurance company that has a problem with this which I think says a lot.

And before someone says that all road users should be equal - I would disagree. There is no equality in a road system where only cyclists/pedestrians are killed by cars and not the other way round. The danger posed by one is so great to the other that its madness to compare the two as equal parties when it comes to compensation for broken bones and (mostly) damaged beyond repair bikes.

In addition to this - it works for everyone. If a cyclist knocks a pedestrian over (even on the road) they would be liable.

BTW - interestingly a form of Strict liability already exists for drivers. If you drive into the rear of a car (unless a witness says otherwise) you are fully responsible for the cost of the damages. Its a case where is one persons story vs another person story the benefit of the doubt falls in favor of the more venerable. This in essence is what Strict liability is.

Were the police interested? Could they be bothered to send a PCSO diet-cop to have a look? Did they hell. The investigation was closed as 'cold' or something. An outstanding effort.

For those so inclined in society to chance the law, once you've be exposed to what every other honest-working, authority-fearing citizen worries about (failed CRB check, loss of driving license, etc.), there is nothing the police ever do. You have to literally torture someone to get a custodial sentence, and even then it's only six months, reduced to three for not shanking someone while you're in, with two months of those on tag.

You can select the disproved EPA study or the WHO study (it cites the EPA study as one of it's main sources so you're still in lala land for a citation really).
Pretty much every other study beyond those two has said passive (i.e. second hand) smoking has a negligible effect on someone. 

I suppose I'll be fair and allow you the emotive hand wringing but really beyond that smoking is only harmful to the smoker and nobody else.  Scientific fact that one I'm afraid.

BTW - interestingly a form of Strict liability already exists for drivers. If you drive into the rear of a car (unless a witness says otherwise) you are fully responsible for the cost of the damages.

We just re-did our commercial contracts, we have the highest or one of the highest match day revenues in the world, we are the fourth most valuable football club in the world according to Forbes' 2013 list only behind ManU, Barca, and Real.  Their valuation takes into account revenue, stadium, transactions, etc and has us at 1.355B, with Liverpool at 675M roughly.   We also are in London, which adds to the appeal for attracting talent as well as being a business hub for the UK.

We've been handcuffed due to commercial contracts we had to sign to sustain us through the transition from Highbury to the Emirates.  Those chains have now come off with the new commercial deals.  Just the ones this season added £70M a year to our coffers.  That raises our overall revenue from 380M to 450M according to Deloitte.  Liverpool's is still around the 230M range unless you have struck new deals this offseason I have not heard about.

I still don't think we'll get Suarez, and would like to see him on your team going forward as your club is a good one.  There's a ton of history at Liverpool and the fans are extremely passionate.

true,TJP343,null,null,"Yea, this should have a lot more up votes. First of all, most teams play in a defensive formation and an attacking formation, so the defensive shape could be 4-1-4-1 with the wingers dropping back alongside the two center mids and then springing forward and running at opposition fullbacks and playing in a 4-3-3 in possession. We have seen this so far from Bayern in preseason and potentially will see it with Barca as well with their new coach.

The attacking assignments in a 4-2-3-1 and a 4-3-3 are very similar. The wingers get wide and push on and the midfield three will generally have a more defensive minded player to shield the back four, a box to box midfielder and an advanced attack minded midfield player. The only difference, really, is whether to play the double pivot(4-2-3-1) or have a fixed holding player(4-3-3).

With the personnel on this team now, I think, the option of going to a 4-4-2 is over(thank god). We're always going to see a center forward, two pacy wingers and three midfielders selected and the formation(attacking) will vary organically based on the team Spurs are playing. If it's against a packed in opponent it may look more like a five man midfield with the wide players coming deeper to get on the ball or more of a 4-3-3 if the opponents leave space in behind(especially if their fullbacks push on) and Spurs look to exploit that by leaving the wide players up higher closer to the center forward.

The main interest for me is how Spurs will set out defensively. A high line was played last season but they were not always pressing up the pitch, at times it was just the forward(s) with the midfield sitting more and forming a close second bank defensive line in front of the back four. A switch to a harder working pressing side would be the biggest defensive development we may see.

For me, they need to stretch the play more and spread out in possession and get more creativity against packed in defenses. That, I think, is mostly solved by adding Soldado and would be augmented by either Chadli or Siggy in behind in an advanced midfield role(trying to invent like VDV) or Dembele pushed into the most advanced midfield role where his ability to beat a man on the dribble would create more chances if he was doing it on the edge of the box and not at midfield.",0,1376003201,null,0,false,0,cbjuhwr,t3_1jyyim,t1_cbjuhwr,t1_cbjqkgf,null,1429896374,6,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,6

He was also first in the league in being dispossessed, 2nd in the league in turnovers per game, and has a relatively poor pass completion rate.

We'll see though, and with reference to why people didn't attend epic - I think you have to realise that for most people without sponsorship for their team it was probably a case of choosing between the two - Whilst I loved EPIC.Ten, it being my first proper LAN too, it's internet issues clouded the entire event. The staff were wonderful and fixed it instantly and thank fuck they were so helpful otherwise we might not have even got a tournament...But I think you have to realise that especially in the epic TEN feedback thread there was an overwhelming response of...Fuck...The internet. That kind of thing just doesn't go away - If it'd been further away from iSeries I think you'd have seen more of a turnout honestly. Also, through no fault of their own, the dota admin they picked (judge i think his name was) completely avoided the LAN and caused giant problems from day 1.

All of this combined with the fact that it was so close to iSeries it probably was a direct choice between the two for a lot of people - I'm sure you can probably understand however disappointing it might be.

If Suarez lays an open goal for Shelvey (which happened a few times, eg vs Newcastle) and he misses, it goes down as a chance created and no assist. That is why these stats are not *that* useful.

His conversion rate improved greatly this season, and if you factor in how many of his opportunities are created by himself it changes things. He isn't just missing sitters, he shoots often because he has to be opportunistic. He can't wait around in the box for a header or tap in, like most strikers with exceptional conversion rates (Gomez, Higuain have the best conversion rates, yet most agree Suarez, Benzema, Ibrahimovic are better strikers despite having conversion rates below 15%).

First in the league in being dispossessed, but also beat the most players and had the most successful dribbles. Depends how you look at it, if he was just passing the ball back every time he received rather than tried to do something with it I would be more upset. Messi lost the ball the most times in La Liga for 2 years running, because he is the one player with the licence to try the difficult, and you have to accept that might happen.",0,1376003944,null,0,false,0,cbjurgo,t3_1jz89u,t1_cbjurgo,t1_cbjui5x,null,1429896251,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

Yeah, I see what you mean. This certainly applies more widely, probably to all sections of society. I think you can see though - from all the cosmetic surgery, anorexia, bulemia etc - that there is a particular self-image problem for women.

&gt; If we are going to start ""policing"" public space like this (which I actually think we should) then we need to cut about 90% of advertising as it's all based on our base instincts and a lot of ""low brow"" TV and Radio (most soap operas and celeb gossip and reality TV).

TV is something which is more private, though, because you choose to watch, which isn't true, to the same extent, for big adverts in public spaces or magazine covers in shops. Also, there is already regulation in place, for instance the watershed, and I'd be surprised if soaps weren't monitored quite closely through Ofcom to prevent them from doing something like advocating suicide. The one thing I'd really like to see introduced is a ban on advertising unhealthy food to children.

They are know for their outstanding positioning and tactical discipline and how well they defend the middle areas as a unit(without a traditional holding mid in front of them). Where the pace is needed is from the two wingbacks, who also have to be hard working going forward and back for the system to work.

Spurs have three good centerbacks and Walker and Rose could play quite well as wingbacks too and they have plenty of center mids to choose from to find a workable trio to fit into either a 3-1-4-2 or a 3-4-1-2. But it would force Bale into the middle as the other striker along Soldado, leave Lennon and Townsend out of the squad almost completely and require more depth at centerback. 

It could work but if Bale and Soldado were marked sufficiently by a back four Spurs could be left searching for attack options too often. And the only width would come from the wingbacks, which means the opposition back four could bunch up against the two forwards and invite Walker and Rose forward knowing if they win the ball back they have tons of room in the wide areas to break into and again are shutting down Bale and Soldado, the two main goal threats.

I don't think he has much if anything to do with Suarez's contentment at LFC. He's a professional attempting to get to the top level (mind, no one really agrees going to Arsenal is a justifiable way to do that).

That may be true, but for the majority of the season we lacked creativity and it came down to Suarez to find the spark. We didn't see enough of him alongside Coutinho to see if that changed.

true,formercedric,lincolnshire,Lincolnshire,"&gt;one being the ludicrous notion that men are raised to hate women

Well it's an opinion. Anyone is free to disagree. The way the bloke keeps banging on about how stupid he thinks it all is another thing entirely.

&gt;another being that the internet should not be censored and anonymity should be preserved 

There are plenty of sites out there for people to behave like absolute dicks without any fear of reprisal whatever. Twitter doesn't necessarily have to be one of them. If a group of people want the utter cretinous shitbags who tell women to get raped on twitter to be accountable for their actions, then what's the big deal?

&gt;Shielding yourself from alternative views no matter how much you may dislike them is dangerous, it leads to an entrenched position that breeds extremism.

That's all well and good but the type of content we're speaking about here is hardly simple alternative views. I wouldn't begrudge anyone for closing down their comments section because it's full of sociopathic morons telling them to go fuck themselves.

&gt;Whats more is why are we focusing only on how women are targeted by online troll? 

Presumably because the attacks they receive are usually pretty deeply-rooted in misogyny. Look at the examples posted. Make a sandwich, get raped bitch, you're ugly, I wouldn't fuck you, feminazi cunts are full of shit. Blah blah blah. It's all the same old guff. Generic internet keyboard gobshites trying to cause anguish and ire in their victims. I'm pretty sure blokes get shat on all over the place on the internet too, but not simply _for being men_.

&gt;Funnily enough many of these threats are from feminists, can anyone say hypocrite? 

Having feminist views doesn't automatically make someone a good person. But I daresay the people on the receiving end of abuse aren't probably the ones dishing it out--they know it feels after all.

&gt;In fact research here from Sweden suggests men receive more abuse and threats than women online.

Male journalists, you mean. And two per cent more abuse at that. Staggering. 

&gt;Anyone who has ever used social media knows there are block buttons and report buttons, any reasonable person knows that threats of violence are against the law. But if they merely used these tools that are at their disposal this wouldn't further their agenda of censorship and abolition of anonymity now would it?

The trouble is, simply ignoring and blocking trolls doesn't seem to work. We don't stand for this sort of shite in real life so why should we online? You don't walk up to a woman on the street and tell her to choke on your cock without expecting to get a slap in the face, severely reprimanded or even arrested; why is doing the same thing on the internet so often _utterly_ without consequence? 

From what I've seen, what's happening more and more is the trolls are getting emboldened by their actions and the validation they get from other trolls. The more this behaviour is accepted as standard the more commonplace it becomes. And when it isn't the trolls standing up for their god given rights to freely call women cunts on twitter, there are armies of liberal redditors to quote Voltaire about how they should be able to.

Try to put the customary internet response to trolling into a similar situation in real life. Imagine a bloke comes up to you and starts yelling ""CUNT"" in your face over and over. You move to react, but your friend stops you. ""No, don't react, it's just what he wants. Yelling cunt at people all day to annoy them is just what he does.

Having said that there is a lot to be said for students and their teachers. Teaching has improved dramatically over the last 30 years. Students are taught in a variety of ways designed to take into account a whole bunch of factors (learning styles, disabilities, reading &amp; spelling ages etc). Students are also taught exam techniques and how to maximise their time in the exam (For example I had a recent meeting with an examiner in which we talked about the difference between key words used in exam questions).

Students still have to learn a hell of a lot, baring in mind the majority of their exams do come in a short period. If an exam paper is seen to be too easy (higher percentage of students getting the top grades) then the grade boundaries are often shifted upwards.

true,James188,null,null,"There's being held accountable and there's what we have where you're damned if you do, damned if you don't. I'm not going to provide examples because they're likely to make me identifiable.

Truth be told I am looking for a way out and it's neither the responsibility, nor the accountability. It's the totally ridiculous behaviour of select groups that will criticise my decisions regardless of what they are. It's the press that will complain for the sake of complaining and will actively fish for a scandal, making one up where there isn't one or dragging up things from over 30 years previously where lessons were learned decades ago.

I'm not saying there should be totalitarian behaviour, what I'm saying is that the work my colleagues and I do in order to protect the public is constantly criticised and you cannot do right for want of trying. All of this criticism and the organisational desire to please people leads to the erosion of my effectiveness. Children actively go out of their way to give me shit, shouting and swearing, trying to pick fights with me... What does that say about society? It's not even a respect for authority issue, it's a respect for your fellow man thing!

I'm sick of trying to help people (which ultimately is why most join the job) to be:
a) taken the piss out of by getting 80% ridiculous, petty, trivial and utterly preventable jobs.
b) being used for social work or an extension to the mental health services. I am used at a free marriage counsellor or young child discipline thanks to parental inadequacies
c) subjected to petty complaints from people with recent convictions for identical offences; the hypocrisy actually hurts.
d) used by people to point score against ex partners by having them arrested for things that transpire to never happened.
e) used as a crime reference number generator so people can make bullshit insurance claims or get crisis loans from the social.

It wouldn't piss me off half as much if ALL of those things hadn't happened during my very last shift, to one or more of my PC's.

Please also note that you saw an excerpt from the letter, not the whole thing. The Sergeant's job is to explicitly justify his decision to the victim, which in this case is exactly what he's done. Are you seriously having a pop at the Sergeant for being factual?! He's not been rude, accusatory, dismissive or lazy; this is not the issue that it's made out to be!
The PC is there to empathise and be realistic and reassuring, the supervisor is one step removed very intentionally for two reasons:
1) the PC will form a rapport with the victim which naturally detracts from a strictly factual and objective outlook to a small extent. The Sergeants job is to be factual and objective in review of the EVIDENCE, so that justice is FAIR and BALANCED, whilst being ACCOUNTABLE. Decisions can be complained about but disposals are often chosen by supervisors based on the PROPORTIONALITY.
2) the Sergeant will quality check the Constable's work to ensure it is suitable to be in court. If the matter does not reach the CPS' Full Code Test then they will discontinue it and waste public money. The supervisor critiques a job and steers it appropriately as someone who is not involved with any emotive party.

If being factual makes me a bad person in your eyes then that's your issue to live with.",0,1376008732,null,0,1376009175,0,cbjweke,t3_1jy504,t1_cbjweke,t1_cbjti1f,null,1429895413,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I work with guys close to retirement, who still go out there daily and give a toss. They're all without exception cynical bastards, but they quietly know they're doing good and that gets them through.

I'm personally very envious of this quality because it breeds a good nature, classic morals (personal discipline) and resilience in the face of the destruction of the job. I'm not of the same mindset and feel resentful toward scroungers; I don't treat them badly, but it leaves a bitter taste I wish I could let go of.

The ones I look up to are the long serving ones who all have the qualities and hallmarks of success... Calmness, objectivity, common sense, authority, confidence, competence and humour. They tend to be less crass or outspoken than others that the job breaks, which has to be telling. The real tragedy is when these people who've given so much have it shoved in their face, it's crushing.

Edit: another massively important quality I can't believe I forgot about... The desire to be right, not popular. It's a job that will upset people which we seem to forget a lot; it's more important to stand up for what's right, instead of playing a game of appeasing everyone. 
I'm hugely content with the fact I upset people, which sounds odd but I don't want to be liked by lying, cheating, deceitful criminals; I want them to be worried when they see me because they know I'm going to call them out on their criminality.

You're placing words in my mouth mate.

In other words, there aren't many, and those there are mostly don't last long in the job.""  Which is _not_ the same thing.  Let me unpack it for you...

 The implication behind this, as a previous poster has noted, is that the policing institution bears much of the responsibility for making police officers ""bad"", in my view, and that whilst as individuals they are just individuals - no more or less likely to be ""good"" or ""bad"" - by choosing policing and sticking with policing they are self selecting towards the bad end of the equation.  This is both because the policing institution trains them to be ""bad"" (i.e. to do the State's dirty work) and because it selects and rewards the most ""bad"" ones to promote within its ranks, and punishes and ejects the ""good"" ones (who reject unwarranted authority, don't put up with the canteen culture/sexism/racism/homophobia of their colleagues, expose corruption,  don't enforce immoral partial law, protect and serve their communities above serving the interests of the wealthy, etc.).

I said to other football fans that i was liverpool fan as I enjoyed the style of play under Rafa and also the players of those squads. However I didn't truly love pool until last year...you might not like this answer but i'm just being honest....

I started watching ""Being Liverpool."" Thats when I was truly able to understand LFC and what it was all about. Even though we've been going through a rough patch, I think we're on the right track, and I see Liverpool as a sleeping giant that is nearly ready to awake and shock the world. I also love the sense of family and camaraderie between pool fans across the world. 

Also with the influx of US fans coming this season, I believe you'll see a good amount of them start to represent the reds, one of these reasons is Americans will gravitate to anything American. A lot of fans would've been tottenham supporters because of Dempsey, but he's moved on to the MLS (not sure how i feel about that but thats for another time). With the Boston Red Sox being extremely popular here in the states, as well as John Henry being a very likeable personality (especially as of late).

To be fair, he missed a lot of games after the Evra incident and we were better there as well without him, it wasn't just at the end of last season.

To be honest, I think he could be brilliant in our system but I think he needs to dial it back a bit.  Stop the countless nutmegs which lead to a loss of a possession and instead realize it's okay to play it back to an advancing player and reset the attack instead.  He doesn't need to do it all on his own anymore so rather than take a shot with a low probability of success, wait and see what else you can do with the ball.  If we can improve our overall team conversion rate, limit some of the loss of possession, and create better chances with the sheer number of chances we do create we could easily have a real shot at 4th.  That's the part where I have some concerns with how he plays.  I'm also not sure that he's entirely happy with losing the primary CF position to Sturridge.  I just have a feeling that much of his negativity towards the club started after he was shifted away from being the focal point of the attack.

To be honest, I was starting to get worried that the show was devolving into a mess of mainstream appeal and sexiness. That's not to say that I don't like that it's got a bigger audience now, just that as the seasons went on a pattern emerged of steadily more attractive main characters being introduced and I was concerned that the show would get lost in an attempt to stay young and fresh and sexy. 

Sure, I would have loved to see a black Doctor, or even a ginger one, but I am way more excited about Capaldi than I was about Matt Smith.

My concern here is with width. You've got Navas on the flank out wide, but then you either have Jovetic on the left, where he can play, but in my mind he's better utilized in the hole as a second striker/CAM, which is also true of Silva to an extent—when we play him wide, he tends to cut inside, which leaves space on the left, and with Navas more hesitant to play in the middle than Silva or Jovetic, that creates an asymmetry. Jovetic might be more likely to stay wide than Navas, but I'm worried that thats not the best use of his talents. Then you have Nasri, who really only plays well in the center, further complicating things. 

Pellegrini favors situational width, which means wide attacking midfielders who can swing out and be wingers, drop in the hole, or cut inside the box for a pass/shoot.

Jovetic might be the best for that role, as Silva tends to drift inward, while Navas tends to stick to the sides, and Nasri stays in the middle, or at least should. With those four it's plainly evident that we have a considerable wealth of talent, but personally I'm left wondering where we'll employ it all.

Villas-Boas is trying to convert Jake to CB, so he can cover both CB and DM.

Townsend supposedly wants out. For 10M, I'd definitely sell him (but include a nice buyback clause, for sure). 

Huddlestone has the passing Jake doesn't, and Parker has the leadership qualities Jake doesn't. But what Jake has over both of them is better positional discipline, better short forward passing, much faster, and he's much better defensively than Huddlestone. He's also 10 years younger than Parker and very happy with being a squad player. 

There are literally no drawbacks to keeping Jake onboard. He won't make a fuss, he's not on the edge of retirement, he's a good (not great) player, he loves the club more than either Hudd or Parker, and he's damn loyal. I'd rather have one Jake than two of either Parker or Hudd. 

Besides, he still has room to grow. He may not ever be starting 11 for the CL for us, but he'll stay with us until he retires, as a squad player, without kicking up a fuss. We're not a huge club that can just keep big players on the bench just because. It's really rare to find someone like Jake.

Wild atlantic/alaskan salmon (~£18/kg), deep red colour, very different to the farmed fish, there are no population problems, but it does come a long way, so its not as tasty as...

Farmed salmon which comes from the lochs in Scotland...

Non-Organic farmed (~£13/kg)  is pink (Salmon is fed coloured food to replicate the colour of wild salmon, which gets its colour from actually using its muscles), big fishes etc, probably similar to your pacific stuff, its generic, its the cheap stuff. Its also screwing up the ecosystems in the lochs due both to the scale of production and the chemicals used in the feed/cleaning etc.

Organic farmed (~£25/kg) (identified by the soil association badge) will be very pale in colour, because of the lack of colouring in the food, this is the best farmed salmon, in order to get the soil association badge it has to be environmentally responsible.

So basically, buy wild or organic salmon, most of what you see with be scottish farmed.


2) You can catch serious fish from the beach, particularly mackerel, I've got loads of photos like [this](http://i.imgur.com/D4vyPnI.jpg) (although this one isn't me, its a friend) from all along the south coast. 

Of course the best thing about the ocean is, free food. 

3) Everywhere is easily accessible compared to the USA which is both good and bad, the only places you can legally wild camp are Dartmoor and Scotland, and in Dartmoor there is still a no fires rule (stoves only).  Having said that, I've wild camped in almost every national park, as long as you're not in some guys field (and leave no trace) you're good, although its not a bad idea to go for a quick day walk first. The lake district has some cool caves like [this one](http://www.leaney.org/lake_district_walk.php?walk_id=783) which I've stayed in, same for the peak district.

There's less organised trail heads and stuff in the UK, its more of a park your car on the side of the road, get out, walk kind of thing there are no park fees or anything. I'd recommend Scotland as a good first UK wildcamping location because of the lack of legal issues.

You're right. Whats's the point in even talking about this? What's the point in having Everton forums? There's no point in talking about tactics or transfers or anything because what we say doesn't matter.

Come on. It's just fun to discuss. That's why we follow football in the first place.

&gt;Thirdly, I wouldn't have said honestly in my post if I wasn't honest. If you were more impressed with Oviedo filling in for Baines than Barkley in the central mid you're mental. 

First, I'm not sure if English is your first language, but I wasn't accusing you of being dishonest - it's a turn of phrase. Plus, I said it in the context of your opinion of Osman and the rest, not Fellaini's pricetag.

Second, I'm not saying I wasn't impressed with Barkley. I was, but ""impressed"" isn't the same as ""confident in"". I'm impressed by Barkley's ability given his age, but I'm currently more confident in Oviedo's capacity at left back than Barkley's capacity in midfield, and I'm sure I'm not the only one.

Third, *you're* mental if you think a center midfield of Gibson and 19-year-old Barkley, with Osman and a bunch of untested kids as backup, will get us into Europe. Center mid is probably the most important position on the pitch, and Barkley has a bad habit of losing the ball in his own half and poor passing in the final third. He has massive potential, but *in my opinion* (which I'm entitled to) he's a lot farther behind Fellaini than Oviedo is from Baines.

Rooney achieved a great amount of success under Sir Alex, but Wayne Rooney clearly wants a fresh start. He and Moyes worked together at Everton, and, without making any comment of his ability, Rooney does not want to play for him again. 

It is not Wayne Rooney's fault that Chelsea wants him on his team. Roman Abramovic usually gets the players he wants. He shelled out a ludicrous amount of money for Fernando Torres, and Manchester United rightly expect that kind of Money. 

There are only so many teams that can afford a player like Rooney. PSG already has Zlatan, and just signed another world class center forward, Edison Cavani, for $85 million. In the Liga BBVA, Barcelona recently acquired Neymar, and Real Madrid continue to dangle close to $130,000,000 in front of Tottenham for the signature of one Gareth Bale. I believe he is a perfect fit for Pep's Bayern Munich, but with the recent signing of Borussia Dortmund's Mario Gotze and the looming signing of their number nine Robert Lewa. next summer, Guardiola has no need to spend that kind of money. Realistically that only leaves Chelsea and Monaco, they don't need him but they may in fact have that kind of money, in contention to sign him. Manchester United fans need to realize that not every player has the loyalty of Ryan Giggs or Scholes.

I would add that there is often a difference in the role of the wingers in the two formations. In a 4-2-3-1, like you say, typically the wingers fall back into a 4-4-2 during the defensive phase. A true 4-3-3 (Fabio Capello joked once managers claim to play 4-3-3 but play 9-1) has wingers that stay farther up the pitch and have less defensive duties. Obviously, every player has to contribute to the defense, but their role is more active rather than falling back into position, pressing the defenders and staying high up the pitch with the goal of preventing the fullbacks from getting forward. Depending on where the ball is, in the defensive phase the 4-3-3 will often look like two banks of four missing the wide player away from the ball.

I think the 4-3-3 makes somewhat more sense with the high line, because pressure is hugely important to prevent simple passes being played over and through the defense. ",0,1376021616,null,0,false,0,cbk0vcj,t3_1jyyim,t1_cbk0vcj,t1_cbjuhwr,null,1429893329,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

true,kopking08,null,null,"This was a pretty fascinating read. Although he's obviously making a point generally about players leaving for Champions League play, I think its hard to say Bale and, at least initially, Suarez were speaking solely about going to Champions League contenders.

Bale I think has had his head turned by Madrid. Suarez did too, although Madrid didn't provoke that themselves.

Bale I don't think would leave Tottenham to be at a club like Arsenal. Which is to say, he obviously understands that both are not sure bets for 4th.

Suarez, on the other hand, is legitimately acting like Arsenal are such an obvious leap. The fact is they may not even qualify for the group stages. If he found himself playing for them and they were in Europa League he'd look like a fool. 

The reality is we know its only a stopgap solution for him. He wanted Madrid. And he'll settle for Arsenal for now. And he'll use them to get to where he eventually wants (and, admittedly, deserves) to be. Which is one of the best teams in the world - which Liverpool are not and won't be in any convincing way for five years at least (best teams being teams you know will be there no matter what).

What this guys whole piece shows me is that eventually we will get to a place where financial parity will be enforced in some way. I expect there will still be dynasties and you'll have most of the usual suspects. But if a club runs itself right it will have a shot. And right now, in England at least with the influx of foreign money, thats not possible.

Dortmund are a perfect example of a club that was able to rise without huge amounts of cash because it went about its business smart. This wasn't a problem because in Germany there was so much parity after Bayern. So they could get Champions League. They could benefit financially from getting it and in terms of recruitment.

In England those places are basically taken by three firm fixtures at this point. Unless Roman or the Sheik experience such financial ruin that no one even wants to bail the clubs out in a meaningful way they are going to be there. 

But with only one spot you only get a shot for one Dortmund. And Liverpool, Tottenham, and Arsenal are not going to give up that spot without a fucking fight. 

In Spain you have two teams and then two slots. In Germany you have three slots (Bayern being the only club with long term success there). In France you've had multiple open.

With foreign cash these spots are closing. Chances to build up a team are closing. Eventually the many will get tired of the power of the few. And then we'll have parity. ",0,1376026419,null,0,false,0,cbk2b1m,t3_1k0bn6,t1_cbk2b1m,t3_1k0bn6,null,1429892659,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9

Your power over the rest of society means that I hold you to much higher standards of morality and legality than everyone else. When the police make mistakes and especially when they break the law, I want to hear about it and if one of the points of our criminal justice system is to be a deterrent, I want them to be punished much more harshly for committing crimes than other civilians. 

Especially since in this and other countries, the Police have been used as a tool of the state to pursue political vendettas. 

So hearing this: 

&gt;It's the press that will complain for the sake of complaining and will actively fish for a scandal, making one up where there isn't one or dragging up things from over 30 years previously where lessons were learned decades ago."" 

Is kind of distressing since there has never been a single prosecution for the 1000+ deaths in police custody since 1990. Members of the police force have repeatedly got away with using behaviour that other members of the public would not. They have also abused the powers they did have (such as the terrorism act) and used the largely sympathetic, largely right leaning media to lobby the government, successfully in many cases, to gain more powers.

true,mushroomgodmat,null,null,"Sure I can. But to act recklessly to cause you to crash (or whatever) and there be no witnesses....unlikely to the point of being irrelevant.

And in those situations where there are no witnesses...then we are talking about an empty road. You have not much of an excuse for hitting a cyclist/pedestrian in such a situation.

How do you feel about the fact that a form of this rule already applies to car drivers already? Fair or unfair?

As iv said, strict liability does not equal blame (u will not receive point or a ban as a result of this). What it does is in situations where there is no witnesses and its your word against another's the benefit of the doubt falls to the most venerable road user (with regard to compensation only)

Consider that a car is 40% more dangerous than a cycle and no one with any sense can truly say they should be regarded as equal. If I cycle into your car what damage will I do, dent a panel? If you drive into me, my bike, maybe even me is damaged beyond repair. It is not an equal playing field and it shouldn't be regarded as one.

Recent figures also show that around 70% car drivers are responsible in car/cycle incidents (the remaining 30% is a mix of both parties/cyclist blame). Imagine being a car driver, you have the capacity to get back in your car instantly, you probably be back at work again the very next day. Can u imagine its the same for those cyclists, if they have not suffered broken bones, would their bike be working, it maybe their only form of transport. How long will they have to wait for compensation for another one?

Here's a few benefits.... Compensation claims can take years, they cost you money, they increase your insurance premium. This would speed up the process massively - and should (though let's be honest probably won't) lower everyone's premium. 

The benefit to a driver and cyclist/pedestrian to avoid months of form filling/phone calls/interview/correspondence is a benefit to everyone.

And this does not just apply to motorists - it applies to drivers/cyclists in regard to pedestrians to. In fact pedestrians are the ones to get the most benefit out of this.

I do see what you're saying, he often loses possession in the middle third which is very dangerous for us because other than Lucas and occasionally Agger we lack the ability to win the ball back quickly. Perseverance is a significant part of his game, and the way he can constantly keep defenders thinking and backtracking should not be underestimated.

Perhaps now we have better quality players we might see what you are saying, a more patient Suarez who has faith in his team mates. He definitely finds partnerships with quality players, notably Kuyt, Meireles, Maxi and now Sturridge. 

Overall I like that you are picking up on the need for patience, and recycling of possession if we wish to become a top team. Too often we try to force the play, the likes of Johnson, Suarez and Enrique are regularly guilty of this. Given Rodgers ideals of possession football this is a problem, but we have seen he is open to change. We became much more direct towards the end of the season as we had Sturridge's pace stretching defences, which left Suarez more space off the striker (even though he is not a natural playmaker as you noted).

We won't be in as much trouble as some seem to think without Suarez, but there is no doubt he provides a spark for us.

But, if cycling was made legal on the pavement I suspect it would make little difference to anyone's safety as cyclists/pedestrian awareness would become higher than it currently is.

Anyway, I don't necessarily agree with cycling on the pavment, but vids like the above I can certainly see the benefits of doing so. 120 lives a year and many serious injures could be saved by cycling on the pavement vs the road.

It's also a bit like red light jumping...less cyclists get killed jumping lights (1-2 a year) than they do waiting at lights (probably in the 20-40s).

- Club loves him

- Manager loves him

- Fellow players love him

- He loves the club

- He is a senior ambassador for the club

- He might be the future captain of the club

- Barclelona has acheived fuck all against Chelsea to convince him in the first place. (On the pitch)

- Barclelona are no longer the hot shit they thought they always were after the humiliation last season.

- Chelsea are not a selling club.

- Jose gives an equal ammount of fucks to Barcelona to Messi's goal against Chelsea.

- Their bid was laughable compared to the sum we got him for and his evolution over the years.

- This was basically Barcelona trying to shut up it's fans saying they need a CB by saying ""Oh well we tried"".

###Reasons Luiz might leave

- He thinks Barcelona are the definite future European champions after taking a hard header of the ball.

- He wants to enjoy a La Liga title. If you don't get it you are incomplete as a player.

- The financial situation in Spain means he can buy an entire town and name it ""David Luiz town"" with his salary. Something everyone wants.

He haven't really sung praises of Arsenal, his desire seems to be Real Madrid every time he gives interviews.

Suarez opened the pandora's box way early in the summer with his interviews. Madrid didn't move, Arsenal cast the line, and Suarez bit the only bait floating.

2)  I also see he statement as a not-so-thinly veiled message to sides with an interest in Suarez (Real being one, but also perhaps City who may lose 1 or 2 strikers and seem to have some level of interest, PSG who also appears to have some level of interest, and even perhaps Chelsea who Guardiola apparently keeps chatting with) that they need to move quickly if they want Suarez and they will perhaps need to include an acceptable player (i.e. 'the replacement') if they want an offer accepted.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I completely agree that women in todays world are being given self-image problems whether they want them or not.  But that is a reason to ban womens magazines and Trisha.  Nut's doesn't even break into the top 100 causes of womens self image issues IMHO...

&gt;TV is something which is more private, 

Ah, but hold on a minute.  The big push against these images hasn't been that they are too racy, it's been that men who look at them turn into bigots and rapists.  It doesn't matter if they are viewed in private or not, because once I've seen them I am going to harass the women in the office all morning and then rape someone over lunch.

If that is true of these mags then it's true of watching Coronation Street with the (domestic) violence or Band of Brothers or anything else in any way ~~interesting~~ not portraying a tightly censored, idealised Britain.

This already goes well beyond telling people what they can and can't do in their own homes.  This is about telling people what they can and cannot *think* inside their own heads.

As such, we need to strike everywhere, not just the middle shelf of the local corner shop.

Personally, I think before we ban anything (I actually have a long list of things I would ban...), we need to practice what we preach.  School meals are atrocious.  Lowest bidder, minimum wage workers exploiting a captive market.  McDonalds would at least have been cheaper and nicer, and no worse, that what I was offered at school (1995-2002).

So before (or at the same time as) we ban junk food advertising to kids, we need to require all school meals to:

 * have at least a third of kids RDA of vitamins, minerals, fibre, protein etc and no more than 40% of their calories, salt etc
 * Include 2 portions of fresh fruit and veg
 * Be different each day of the week rather than chips, chip and chips
 * Cost less than a McDonalds Happy Meal (That is the actual measure I would enshrine in law).

Until them, we are just hypocrites.  We won't let McDonalds advertise to kids but we will force feed them horse burgers with less nutritional value?!  Madness!

For me, the same applies to all this anti-porn nonsense.  We don't want our little darlings to look at tits or to think liking tits in somehow normal.  But we are happy for them to think that the way to be a man is to punch other men for looking at you funny, or that a woman has to be beautiful and blond before she is complete as a person.

For me, it has to be all of nothing.  I like the free-for-all.  But I am lucky:  I was born smart and I a big guy.  So I have few issues around my masculinity and those I gained, I have mostly dumped.  Given that, I'll keep my porn thanks, and the only way I will give it up, is if we are giving up the whole free for all.  Because then boys and girls might stand a better chance.

I won't give up my porn (or feel ashamed for buying it, or accept that it is in anyway bad) just so someone can write an article about how they defended women from brutish men before going back to praising Botox and Kate Middleton.  And that seems to be what is being asked of us here.  Page 3 stays, TV is untouched, but Nut's has got to go!  Nope.

Sorry this is so long, and thanks for reading this far.  Also, thanks again for your reasonable and well written replies :)

In our case, the idea was to provide mixed housing in support of local social services, and try to meet the demand for better quality social housing - the church had a load of fields that were unused, so it was an easy match. I'd be really surprised if GP didn't intend something similar for their housing, as a) it'll help with planning permission, b) working with the government department in this way would help cover a lot of the running costs, and c) it's a huge form of outreach and a demonstration that they care for the local community.

This sort of church campus is fairly common with a lot of American super-churches. The idea is to provide a community where the people from the congregation - the church family - can hang out beyond Sunday mornings: gyms, restaurants, schools etc. are very common. 

The danger is that the church family could become inward-looking and therefore isolated.

Hopefully, and certainly from their rhetoric, it seems like there's nothing but good intentions at work here. I too have heard lots of local bad press of the 'whacko-cult' variety; who knows what is true or not without going?

As standalone owners I very much like everything they've done tbh. They were humble about their lack of footballing experience when they first arrived, and acceded to fan demand and people they thought would know how to proceed when they let Dalglish/Comolli run the club, and for that they got badly burned. From then on they have shown a much more forward thinking approach than those supposedly knowledgeable characters, recruited a manager who is entirely in synch with their vision, and set the club on a good and sustainable course again.

Was oldest son but had lots of male cousins a bit older than me, all liverpool supporters. Lots of Irish links to LFC - players of old, lots of Irish live in Liverpool, families resettled there. Its half an hour in a budget flight.

Was in a red jersey before I could even kick a ball lol...

Over the years I have had lots of good friends who are also LFC fans. ( and had to take shit of fans of other persuasions )

Went to Anfield many times ( favourite was hammering RM in the CL, respect between the 2 sets of fans was amazing, we appluaded when they sang of their European success, and they reciprocated when we sang of ours. This is why our history is important for those who take stick off other fans.... occasions between European legends give value to our past success when you see the respect we have built )


Other memories of Robbie Fowler scoring into our end, Torres stripping defenders ( his acceleration and power was something to behold in the flesh ). Hillsborough a very sad memory ( watched it unfold live on tv, no-one realised what was happening ).

Love the club. Modern footballers are making me a bit sick though.

true,Bette21,eng-kent,Kent,"As someone who would also identify as a feminist, I am so conflicted by this debate. 

On the one hand, I am all for the normalisation of nudity. I don't want our country to get to the state where a flash of boob is considered an outrage, it's literally just a part of the human body. I think there are a lot of problems with the magazine industry, and I would go so far as to say women's publications can be infinitely more damaging to women than men's. 

On the other hand, I can't help but feel these sort of magazines perpetuate that feeling of the body being something to keep under cover, just because the nudity is presented in such an overtly sexual fashion. People get uncomfortable about public breastfeeding because they think boobs are sexual and grown men think it's acceptable to openly leer at my 16 year old colleague when she wears short shorts. It's just skin, but these lads mags make every inch of it a sexual thing by oiling it up.

So yeah, I don't really know how to feel about this.

I really hate the kind of tone of this video, which is all dressed up with the language of rationality and enquiry but actually drips with dishonest rhetorical techniques, unexamined prejudice and SERIOUS issues with regards to women.  It really pisses me off when people charge others with being inflexible and unwilling to debate, but won't budge an inch from their position because they figure that they have reached it through logic and reason, regardless of the fact that such things only get you half way when discussing complex social issues.

The issues surrounding feminism have been discussed and debated and argued on for decades and decades by serious academics, and the idea that some self-important bellend with a youtube channel can rebut them all with his magical prism of logic (whilst actually failing to do anything of the sort) is fairly tiresome.  Paul Mason is a journalist and writer of long standing who, in a straight fight, I imagine could argue this ThundercUUnt character into a cocked hat.  The fact that he doesn't bother and just dismisses it out of hand is not because he is somehow un-impartial, but because he is just trotting out many of the tired old tropes that have been argued with time and again, and it's prety clear that any further discourse wouldn't be the slightest bit productive. The idea that one has to be 'impartial' in the debate over treatment of women in society is pretty laughable anyway, even on the BBC - the BBC has to be impartial in matters of UK political debate, but the idea that we must show 'both sides of the story' on every bleeding issue under the sun is the mind set that leads to climate change deniers being trotted out at a far higher rate of frequency than the strength of their arguments deserves.

FSG have played a blinder over Suarez,  now give the team the help it needs. Move heaven and earth to give BR the targets i'm sure he has in mind or next summer will be even uglier than this.

Let's say you wanted to move to another country because you thought your life would be better there and you were met with hostility the second you landed, you were struggling to learn the language, but you were trying and yet everyone was mocking you or getting angry with you for not being able to understand them when they speak in colloquialisms with rapid speed diction.

Lots of people mock you because of the food you eat and say you smell like your food. Your children get picked on at school because of their skin colour or the weird clothes they have to wear because of your culture. So you feel ostracised and start to live in British communities and never really learn the language or the culture, but then the government and political parties accuse British people of not being able to integrate.

Well that'd be pretty shitty wouldn't it and I think if a politician in that country noticed the problem and said that the people of wherever-land needed to be more tolerant and change a bit so British people can integrate more then that wouldn't even be wise, it'd be obvious.

If you think those things aren't happening, then you're a moron who is out of touch with society.

If you really think ""fuck any politican"" who thinks we need to change those parts of our culture then it is quite clearly you who is disgusting and wrong.

I was thinking of querying that but then I realised I was making a completely different point.

The ""exam"" may become easier because the harder stuff has been moved to the coursework. Does that make the qualification any less valid.

Or the teachers are able to provide more practical sessions, keeping more students involved and teaching all people more. So more people are learning more stuff, this can only be a good thing.

When most people talk about the ""exam"" being easier they're asking if it's easier to get a specific grade on the qualification. So lets ignore the syntactical difference there.

I think what is ""easier"" nowadays is being involved if you want to be as a student. Most parents I hear complaining things are easier for their kids is because the kid doesn't sit through sheets of &lt;equation type x&gt; that the parent can still do through muscle memory. Yet the parents are still turning to friends books etc. to help them guide their kids through coursework, reports and the like.

true,HarryBlessKnapp,null,Petes not so secret gay lover,"In a nutshell;

My dad got sent to prison, and left my mum in dire financial trouble. I was tasked with taking over the family business, with me as director, in order to pay my mum's £4,000 a month expenses. However, the business was already failing. Then we found out my dad had been having an affair, so my mum and dad split whilst he's still in prison, and I'm being played as a pawn and go between. Now they're completely split and that's settled. And then my Grandad died. So I had to watch my old man sobbing like a baby, which is weird not just coz he's my dad, but also because he's built like Desperate Dan. All the while he's still chained to a prison guard. A very humbling experience. Next thing we know, the business is failing, my mum and brother's are going to be made homeless. My mum is screaming at me, begging me for money. But it's just not there. I'm working my balls off, and all the money is going towards someone else's mortgage, and if the business goes badly it's my mum and brothers on the streets. If it goes well they get all the money and I get paid fuck all, for all the stress. So my mum is trying so sell the house, but she can't because the court has got a restraining order on it, proceeds of crime act or some shit. So she's stuck in a house that she can't afford, and the CPS won't let her sell it. So she is massively fucked. She's stuck with a mortgage she can't afford, with no money for utility bills and could still lose the house. She cries a lot. Her and my brother's are even struggling for food money sometimes. And to top it all off, I'm currently living in Liverpool, and I don't have any friends up here for support, plus I work from home, so I spend days at a time trapped in my house alone with my thoughts.

And the funny thing is, there's a small part of me that enjoys all this. Because pain is your friend, and life is about emotions. It's about ups and downs, and the downs are just as exhilarating as the ups, and both the ups and downs are equally as influential in making you what you are. You're never more alive than when you are massively in the shit, because that's when the pain kicks in, and if you're in pain, that means your body is still fighting and it has got something worth fighting for. And I have to admit that I find it exhilarating. Because at the end of the day, it's all about being high on life, and I've realised that you can get just as high off the troughs as you can from the peaks. And I've come to relish them in a way.


Anyway, the reason I tell you all this, is because sometimes when it all gets a bit much, I like to listen other people's problems. Because it makes me realise I'm not alone, I'm not the only one in the world with problems. It calms me down. Helps me normalise my situation. Don't know if it works for you but thought I'd give it a try. But yeah, I've thought about the nuclear option. I've never actually planned it, or seriously considered it. But it has crossed my mind.

This is worthy of intellectual debate, because: do Sports Direct *need* to use ZHC, because of 'the economy'? Or have they exploited it as a loophole in the system to give as little regard to employee welfare as possible, for their own benefit?

In the article, it states that while ZHC do have some specialist uses, Sports Direct have come particularly under fire because they're the kind of traditional business model that actually needs its staff in regular patterns. They are viewed by some as using them as a convenient substitute for full hours staff - all the same responsibilities, no protections or benefits.

Something similar happened to my then-girlfriend at her last job - she started on a temporary contract and was left on it indefinitely. The years went by, her ""permanent"" colleagues with less experience and a lower workload got better treated, she missed out on usual employee benefits like a pension and paid holiday entitlements, and finally after half a decade as one of the most praised in the office they made her redundant one Friday afternoon with twenty minutes' notice. All perfectly legal, allegedly.

It's not a healthy way to live, long term. I do not agree that the companies have no responsibility, but they're acting naturally - the real blame does lie in Westminster.

Epic11 was friendlier, cheaper, and closer to home. I had a great time and met some cool people... but ultimately we were there to play games.


Having only 4 teams turn up was disappointing, but the admins did a great job of making do.
Unfortunately, there were issues with the internet, especially on day 1, I think we got only 1 or 2 games out of 6-8hours


I series is THE lan, and epiclan need to offer a superior service if they’re ever going to entice people to attend their events over Iseries.


Epiclan picked up dota before Iseries did, and really should have pushed on from there - but from what I hear epic ten was not without its faults either and I guess you reap what you sow…


They should not give up on Dota, I am sure that we all believe Dota is going to become the no.1 esport and so dropping it seems ridiculous.


I think the proximity of the two events is an issue, epic might be better off being at the end of June rather than July. 
I know that my team could not attend both lans, when they are July &amp; August due to work and other commitments.
Hosting the event during term time, would probably ensure there are less clashes with holidays and not cause too many issues for the target age range (university and college breaks up before the end of June)


Could the venue be improved? All of the separate rooms is nice in a way, but it’s also not as impressive as I series and it deadens the atmosphere a bit



I’ve been very surprised with the lack of online tournaments and the lack of scrims available.
Compared with counterstrike, the game feels totally empty despite having 10x the amount of players, I don’t quite understand that


Online leagues and tourneys give me something to work towards, a purpose to improve, and I don’t think matchmaking could ever replicate that.


Is this where UKDOTA could step in?
Facilitating somewhere for teams to play against each other on a regular basis, an open ladder or similar?


I don’t really understand the purpose of having an inhouse league of solo players for what is ultimately a team game?
Encouraging people to form teams and compete together is surely going to be more beneficial for all

The youngest people within the group (including people with A* A levels in Mathematics) had a lot of trouble with the earlier papers and the star of the group was a retired gentleman that had worked within local government for his working life that didn’t miss a point.

Most of your expenditure will probably come down to food - find some cheap hearty meal recipes online(emphasis on the hearty aspect for winter) and make them in bulk, if possible cook giant meals with your roommates as this will also reduce the cost. 

Drink everywhere in London is expensive compared to the rest of the UK. There are however some cheap ways to get around this such as buying beer from supermarkets rather than pubs. The New Cross Inn also offers a half price happy hour 7-8PM every weekday meaning you can get pints for £1.80-£2.20 instead of the usual £3.50-£4.50. The Student Union also does very cheap drink although the atmosphere in both of these places can often be found to be lacking. 

As a typical rule of thumb with London, the further into the centre you go, the higher the price goes up. So be wary of that :)

When the troubles kicked off in the first place you had *very* hight rates of unemployment in the catholic community. 

Now if you look back at other countries in the past which have gone through a lot of political upheaval in the 20th century, most of it happened in the wake of the great depression. In Germany they turned to the Nazis  because they had nothing left to loose. In Italy they turned to the fascists. In Greece today they are turning to Golden Dawn and Syriza.

If you look at the Arab Spring, youth unemployment in arab countries was staggeringly high and look what happened there. There is also the matter of rising food prices which often coincides with large scale turmoil like this.

The riots in Belfast in 1920 were caused by high unemployment. In that incident the loyalists drove out catholics and other protestants out of their jobs at Harland and Wolff.

There are other factors that come into it as well but it's very usually unemployment that turns an underlying thing like loyalists being worried about the erosion of their way of life into large scale disturbances like the flag protests and the 12th stuff.

true,epemberton,yorkshire,People's Republic of South Yorkshire,"Funny that, I'm pretty sure that petty semantic squabbling and tone-policing could also fall under the bracket of 'thought-terminating cliches'.  No shining paladin of the church of rational thought would ever stoop to such underhand tactics, surely?

Just in case you're not clear, it is capable for somebody or something to be misogynist or act in a misogynist way, without them having to stomp through life screaming 'I Hate Women' at five second intervals.  If people in this thread were to actually engage with feminist discussion, rather than burn straw man after straw man, perhaps they would discover the many cultural attitudes that can lead to systematic misogyny, which only requires passive acceptance by people to propagate. 

&gt;Even on the Internet, that is fairly rare.

We are clearly living on different internets.  Even if we're keeping misogyny to the strict definition of direct expressions of hatred towards a woman, the internet is rife with it.  This is before we even get on to the numerous more subtle difficulties faced by women trying to get their voice heard online (automatic presumption of maleness, inappropriate commentary on appearance, kitchen 'jokes').

I'd agree that sometimes the phrase misogyny is used in place of a more nuanced explanation, or that 'sexism' would be more appropriate in many situations.  But somehow I don't think you'd cease to have a problem with feminism expressed through the internet if they simply did your bidding and made a slight semantic shift.

And, just for the record, that video is certainly misogynistic.  Perhaps this is just my subjective interpretation, but his voice is dripping with spite and loathing as he recounts the tale of Elevator-gate.  He practically spits out the word 'arrogant' as he describes her going on to YouTube to speak her mind.  I see no other reason than misogyny as to why someone putting forward their experience and their side of the story be discounted so totally as arrogance, unless by someone who had serious issues with women saying things he didn't like.

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"I have to disagree. I think we must differ in what we think of as ""the poor"".

What I think you're saying is that many people need to take care of their finances, and pass on getting the latest iPhone, or a new car, or go to that expensive restaurant. Which is totally true for the majority of people. We shouldn't expect to always have an increasing quality of life forever.

But when it comes to ""the poor"" as I understand the term, ie. the people who literally can't afford food and heating and have to go to the food bank to feed themselves, then there's nothing further that they can realistically ""do without"" anymore.

What makes this guy an asshole to me is not that he's a spoilt pompous dickhead (which he incidentally is).

What makes him an asshole is that he doesn't realise or refuses to acknowledge the fact that there are people in our 1st world country who are really living in *true* poverty. Not poverty like they can't afford sky TV. Poverty like they can't afford both food and heating at the same time. Poverty like they are freezing to death in the winter.

People like this Baron de Asshole live in their palace, with their servants, their hereditary titles (let's not even get started on the bullshit of hereditary peers) and their money, and they are just clueless about how bad some people seriously have it. They assume that we are complaining about poverty just because we can't buy iPhones. They assume that with better financial planning and more hard work, ""like they do"", we could be rich too!

**The 7th Baron de Shite is wrong because he doesn't know how poorly some people in the UK are actually living. He's an asshole because he sprouts this bullshit without thinking. He's a dickhead because he doesn't even care about bettering himself with more knowledge of his own country and people. He's a fuckwit because he thinks that everything can be solved if people were only as smart/hard working as he is.**",0,1376055676,null,0,false,0,cbk7j49,t3_1k0o45,t1_cbk7j49,t1_cbk61mu,null,1429890110,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Considering the state of our country thanks to the original ""Made do &amp; Mend"" policies:  indirect train lines, too few train lines with too little capacity, road networks that are very higgldy piggldy in cities rather than the more modern (and easier to manage traffic flow) grid system.... NHS hospitals that are trying to stuff 21st Century equipment in to a 1940's - 1960's designed hospital... and so on and so forth. 

Make do &amp; Mend is the principal reason we don't have our own TGV/BulletTrain/Maglev (and the Maglev thing pisses me off, WE were world leaders in that technology) and why the Blackwall tunnel going down will cause a large chunk of the M25 to jam solid. 

But those are big things so what happens when you scale it down to an individual level?  Same thing applies for the most part, looks cheaper until you really start digging in to it: 

Cost to buy a brand new replacement TV (your old ones is on its last legs): £200
It's going to be cheaper to ""Make do &amp; mend"" right?  Drag it off to a repair place and get an EE to rummage in its guts.  Not so much when you factor in just how much Sony/Panasonic/etc will charge for certain parts (IC's with custom ROM's blown on them and that sort of thing); that's if they sell just the IC, you usually have to buy the whole module.  So depending on what's gone wrong you could be looking at anything from £20 to well over £200 (the cost of a new one).  And yes these companies do price parts in such a way that you quickly reach Beyond Economical Repair.

Even if you just take it in for an estimate and decide not to go ahead with it the cost of that estimate + new TV is still going to be more than just going off any buying a new one.    

Sure the idea that your iPhone 4S works fine so you don't really need the iPhone 5 is a fairly sensible one but to allude what is simply savy consumerism to Made do &amp; Mend totally undermines that and anyone with any knowledge of history which, if we're all honest a 7th Baron should bloody well have in spades shows him to be nothing more than an upper class twit with zero connection to reality.

He was an economic genius and a phenomenal chancellor. 

He never should've been PM but do a tiny bit of googling and you'll find that Brown was *very* clever when it came to economic policy and avoided a disaster which could've been far worse and his economic policies were copied across the world which most economic analysts agree 4 years on- could've been a far worse depression/recessinon

http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/06/gordon-brown-save-world-uk

&gt;Out of power, Brown doesn't have many public defenders left. The careerists have scarpered, and the man himself is almost invisible. Not for him the usual New Labour afterlife: Blair's mysterious Faith Foundation or David Miliband's habit of writing articles for the New Statesman so banally opaque that the only question they prompt is ""what did he think he meant by that?""

&gt;But if we correct the account of those two years, it not only makes for fairer history; it recasts some of the biggest current political controversies. Labour politicians might at last be able to qualify the story that all their government did was leave the country a massive overdraft – that amid the biggest crisis since the 30s, they made largely the right calls while the Tories got it largely wrong. Even more important, it could open up the stiflingly narrow debate over how Britain should respond to a looming second recession.

&gt;So cast your mind back to the weeks and months after Lehman went down. Financial markets were freezing up. The world economy was going into cardiac arrest. In Britain, there was a very real prospect on some nights that cash machines wouldn't open in the morning.

&gt;What sticks out about that period is how Brown and Alistair Darling were not only acting without a roadmap, they were driving with Cameron and Osborne right on their bumper telling them to do a U-turn. The diagnosis that British banks were dangerously low on capital was correct – but it was the opposite of what most bankers were saying.

&gt;The decision to put government money into stricken banks was exactly the policy that Bush and his treasury secretary Hank Paulson had pooh-poohed. In the end, however, the US and others copied the British plans. As Nobel laureate Paul Krugman remarked: ""Brown and Alistair Darling have defined the character of the worldwide rescue effort, with other wealthy nations playing catch-up."" And how Brown was sneered at for cajoling other governments to pump money into the world economy. How the Tories leapt upon Germany's denunciation of his policies as ""crass Keynesianism"" – then kept mum when Angela Merkel launched her own massive budget stimulus. The $1tn deal brokered by the British government at the G20 summit in 2009 was described by the World Bank as ""having broken the fall"" of the global economy.",0,1376056939,null,0,1376057185,0,cbk7w5o,t3_1k0nr5,t1_cbk7w5o,t1_cbk7toc,null,1429889942,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

&gt; about a third (38%) would like to work more hours.

So that leaves 62% (the majority) who did not feel that they would like to work more hours.  Granted the wording on a survey such as this is really important.

Not sure what the 14% has to do with this, all I was referring to is the fact that **the majority of people** actually do **not feel they want extra hours.** - This is from the source survey.  This is not an anecdote, this is not an op-piece.

This is what the survey said.

As for the 14% who fail to have what they consider a basic standard of living, lets multiply that 14% by the upper bound of people on zero hour contracts, which comes too less than half of one percent of the working population.  I would suggest that as more than 0.5% of the working population are below the poverty line, it isn't that significant in the grand scheme of social development.  My point is that we shouldn't take that in isolation.  How many people on regular contracts feel they don't earn enough to provide a basic standard of living?

If you find a great actor coupled with inspired writing you could pull it off, but if you screw it up, then I think it goes very badly with a lot of that failure being pointed at the fact that the doctor was female (whether it be true or not)  Which in turn would further solidify the prejudices of those that don't think a female could do the role.  (Which I don't believe is true)

It's a sensitive issue, and there are A LOT of people with strong opinions on this one.  And I believe that casting a female doctor would greatly affect the viewership of the show in an interesting and somewhat unpredictable way.  

I personally am interested in seeing a female doctor, no so much as a equal opportunity thing, but more as a sincere curiosity on how they would approach it and where they would take it.

But I don't agree with a lot of the commentary that's out there which is the equivalent of:

""Why can't you just cast a female doctor?  You guys said it was possible.  What's so hard about that?""

I think casting a female doctor is inherently risky.  There would be fallout.  You see the heated discussion threads.

Also, it's been quite obvious to me that Suarez would never be sold to Arsenal. He might be sold abroad still, but I doubt it, but it appears we were after Costa anyway, even if Suarez stayed. In that situation, we would've most likely played Sturridge up front, with Costa on the left, Suarez on the right and Coutinho in the hole. We would've had at least 2 in each of those positions in that scenario as Aspas, Alberto, Sterling, Ibe and Borini could've come off the bench. That would be ideal!

true,majormantastic,staffordshire,Staffordshire,"They were willing to let it go because actually in some respects the assault wasn't serious because it resulted in no serious injury. I actually sustained more injury cutting my hand on his teeth hitting him when he came at me for a second time than the sore nose I got from him initially punching me. I hit him once when he lunged at me as a last resort to get him to stop (talking wasn't helping the situation), after this I noticed the half empty bottle of vodka he was holding because he began to threaten me with it. So in another sense it was a serious incident because there was the potential for me to have been put in hospital or a morgue had I not been able to get to my friend's house; I dread to think what would've happened to me if he'd used his bottle or I'd tripped or something. The reason I wanted to pursue the case wasn't because of physical injury sustained it was because I suspected that if he wasn't penalised then he'd keep doing the same thing to people. It was also because of what his intent had been and because I no longer felt safe near where I lived.

I think the argument that we shouldn't rely on police (and the justice system) to provide disincentive is a little too idealistic for my tastes. People in general know assaulting others is bad, the problem is making them care about it. There are people who just don't care and there will always be people that don't care because all men are NOT born equal no matter how much a government attempts to level the playing field. I guess your idea for a good disincentive revolves around the idea that you shouldn't hurt people because that's not conducive to our society. That only works if everyone is happy with their position in society or at least has some hope of improving their situation. Is everyone in the UK happy? Does everyone who has problems in the UK know what to do to stop their problems? Do they believe in the systems in place that are supposed to facilitate this? Can you think of any society that could answer those three questions with yes?

I figured with that increased opportunity to watch I ought to take NBC up on it.

How did I settle on Swansea?  Well, there were only a handful of teams that will have more than one game on the broadcast network (guaranteeing that I can see them).  A few I ruled out immediately because the last thing I wanted to do was jump on some bandwagon.  That left West Ham and Swansea, each of which has two games scheduled to be televised on NBC.  Between the two, someone who knows more about it that I do suggested that Swansea plays a more entertaining style of game.

Those weren't strawmen arguments.  I never misrepresented your views at all.

&gt;Child labour is different from adults doing unpleasant types of work for many reasons, reasons which have been expounded upon many times and are widely understood. You're being disingenous in presenting my position as analagous to that literally non-existant minority who propose it's return.

It uses the exact same reasoning that you do.  I had hoped to elucidate the flaws behind this race to the bottom mentality and viewing of the economy as a zero sum game.  As workers are paid less, demands falls and the economy shrinks.

&gt;As to the second one, I'm not saying they should have low wages and the use of zero-hour contracts doesn't necessarily entail that. 

Depends on the hours they get.  Financial instability certainly would lead to a lower standard of living.

&gt;Firstly, if it weren't for that type of contract many of them would be unemployed

Underemployment isn't that much better.

&gt;and couldn't support themselves (see comparison with rigid-labour-laws France above) 

You keep saying this about France.  You should note that the [poverty level there is much lower than that in the UK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_percentage_of_population_living_in_poverty).  This is a far more relevant statistic than, I suppose, unemployment.  It may be that the poorest in France aren't forced to take jobs they don't want and are better supported by welfare.

&gt;and secondly 86% of the people on the contracts say that they earn enough to maintain a basic standard of living on them. Would they want better conditons? Would they want more money? Yes, but that's not the responsibility of the government to enforce. The government is responsible for creating an environment where people can, and will, try to earn their way. Supporting zero-hour contracts does not undermine that obligation.

The well being of the populace certainly is in the interests of the government.  

&gt;As to the quote, it's not applicable in a nation which aspires to be a social democracy like ours does. Our taxation and benefits system is redistributive in nature and designed to prevent people falling below a certain standard of living. Though, from time to time, it fails to do that, the upshot of the system is that even if your own wages don't cover your material needs, the wealthier people in society make a contribution to cover the difference.

That is not how a social democracy works.  That isn't even capitalism.  It's the worst of capitalism mixed with the worst of socialism.  You advocate that tax payers should subsidise low wages.  That would simply lead to a race to the bottom and a terrible economic climate.

He already made the decision for him that it probably wasn't worth his time to collect enough evidence since he thought it would be knocked back anyway. Of course the ""right"" decision sadly has to take budgets into consideration and allocation of the officer's time.

In terms of a low level assault not being worth it I would argue that that's not ALWAYS true; in my case the guy who had assaulted me had a long line of run ins with the police for similar stuff, he had also threatened me with a bottle, there was NO provocation, he was with friends one of whom did actually try to knock me to the ground, they were drunk (impaired judgement). This incident had the potential to be a lot worse and only chance led to it turning out the way it did. The point is, I would say it is in the public interest to pursue a case like that to at least try to prevent that person from continuing to behave like that by making it clear that his actions do have consequences. 

That's my opinion, however, I also know the little shit will continue to be a little shit probably regardless of whether he gets fines or community service orders or even prison; some people don't really care and you could argue until you're blue in the face as to what you should do to stop this behaviour. Nonetheless, at the end of the day if lack of funding is causing the police to send out the message that these cases are simply not worth pursuing then people are not going to feel safe on the streets and you risk enabling a lower level of civil disobedience, only doing something about it when some poor sod ends up in hospital.",0,1376064274,null,0,false,0,cbkag59,t3_1jy504,t1_cbkag59,t1_cbjo1gk,null,1429888749,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I said this to my mate the other day. No one has **ever** been offered £86m for a player, let alone £100m. Levy would be absolutely insane to reject it. Bale is not the best player in the world and to be honest, if just 2 or 3 of those screamers he scored in the last minute last season had cannoned off the post, people wouldn't be talking about such crazy numbers.

Just because he won Spurs 24 points by himself (which is erroneous in itself as an argument anyway), doesn't mean he'll be equally as vital to Real Madrid. I could score 60 goals in League 2 (okay I couldn't, but in theory), but I wouldn't be worth more than a million or two at most to a team in the Championship or Premier League. He'd go from an outstanding player in Spurs' team to a player in Ronaldo's shadow at RM. Levy should accept the £86m and run.

I hope, and possibly suspect, that in the long run this might come back to bite Spurs on the arse.

Henry is a numbers guy, he wants to build the product through commercial means, and on that front, I think he has been successful. 

He isn't the type of owner to have his own pressbox at every game where he is seen moping, the type who forces transfers on managers, and runs the club like its his play thing (Abramovich) 

He bought the club as a commodity he thinks he can improve, and unlike Hicks/Gillette, he views winning as a huge part of that growth.

What I have noticed is that FSG seem to be frustrated with the nature of business in the sport, and traumatized by the amount they wasted on the notorious Dalglish/Comolli signings.

This isn't saying anyone, even poor people, should do without. It is saying people should cut down waste, and he goes on to propose using eBay and repair shops more than just throwing stuff out.

true,Vaneshi,cnty-england,Midlander trapped in Hampshite,"&gt; I mean, think about it.. that's a £500 phone, £400 tablet, £120 headphones. They are high priced, image-based, luxury 

Keep in mind the phone and tablet are probably on the 'never never' somehow (be it actual HP or a contract) and I have compared £100 headphones to £30 ones, from the same company.   My £100 headphones leak less audio, are far more comfortable and sound better than the £30 ones; they're even less bulky despite being made of high quality plastics.  The old adage ""Buy cheap buy twice"" does occasionally ring true as does ""appearances can be deceptive"". 

&gt; I just don't see that attitude anywhere today.. I mean.. I don't have it and I was raised by them.

Your parents were raised in a different period, they didn't have the exposure to unrelenting hard sell advertising that you did.  Not only that but at least one of them probably had to attend a class at school called ""Home Economics"".

Whilst this would of covered much the same as ""Food Science"" does today it also covered making/altering clothes, balancing a cheque book and other really quite useful skills which can be summed up as 'applied mathematics'.  That isn't generally something schools do these days, it's not in the curriculum.  It's expected you'll figure out how what you learned in math class equates to an APR, the difference between gross and net... obviously this is not the case for the vast majority of people.

This is also actually one of those conversations I've had with the inlaws.  We adjusted their first ever house (£12k) and their earnings at the time for inflation and applied modern mortgage terms to it.  After several rounds of having to fudge figures more in their favour until they'd accept it there was absolutely no way they could afford that property today.

So they'd of had to rent.  But renting in this country is considered a mugs game, it's seen as skeezy even though in France and elsewhere in Europe it is far more common to rent than it is buy your home... so they wouldn't of rented as it'd of meant being considered a mug and foolish.   They'd of boomeranged right back to their parents. 

There is a quote from Marilyn Manson in the docurama Bowling for Columbine that covers this as well: 

&gt; Because that's not the way the media wants to take it and spin it, and turn it into fear, because then you're watching television, you're watching the news, you're being pumped full of fear, there's floods, there's AIDS, there's murder, cut to commercial, buy the Acura, buy the Colgate, if you have bad breath they're not going to talk to you, if you have pimples, the girl's not going to fuck you, and it's just this campaign of fear, and consumption, and that's what I think it's all based on, the whole idea of 'keep everyone afraid, and they'll consume.'

The main problem here (to my eyes) is that nobody knows what an independent Scotland would look like (national debt, oil revenues, water revenues, territorial waters, trident, army, navy, air force, BBC, currency, EU, NATO, etc etc).  Much of the outcome would be based on negotiations with the rest of the UK, so until those negotiations have happened we won't even know what we're starting out with, let alone how everything will develop.
The only real reason I can see so far is that England tends to vote for horrific parties like the Tories and UKIP, whereas the rest of the UK don't.  But that's *always* going to be the case.  I'm sure there'd be an East Coast-West Coast voting split in an independent Scotland (or Highland-Lowland split), so I don't see that as a particularly convincing reason.
