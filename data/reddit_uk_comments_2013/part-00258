I don't think that could happen until negotiations begin. 

At the moment, if the white paper had specific numbers saying ""we'll get X from the RN, Y from the Army and Z from the RAF"" then it'd only require one of those numbers to be shown incorrect/unobtainable  and the entire report would be rubbished by the media. Rather than that they've given their view of what Scotland needs and how to achieve it and people can make their own decisions - it's up to others to say why it isn't achievable.

&lt;bit of a rant&gt;
As it is, the UK media is trying to sow enough fear so the Government doesn't have to make any case for staying in the union. At the moment there are people quoting 50 year reviews as if those 50 year figures are set in stone and therefore independence is terrible, because the Scottish Government hasn't provided alternative 50 year figures. But where are the requests for comparable figures from the UK Government. And even if there were 50 year UK figures, no one would expect them to be accurate. 

And the media will have some topic showing how the Westminster Government has fucked something else up, be it the economy, the health service, the police, the prisons etc etc and then seem dumb struck that anyone would want to be rid of shitty Westminster party-politics. 

As Richard Littlecock says, you couldn't make it up.

Thousands of people on a single tube train? Responsible for their lives when there are plenty of systems that will stop the train in the event of driver error? Maybe we should make sure the depot workers, signalling designers and technicians are all paid more instead and allowed to make sure the equipment is tip-top?

Yet in the very same city there's a driverless mass transport system that has worked very well for the decades it has operated. It's not underground, but it wouldn't be an insurmountable obstacle to get it done below the surface. The Underground itself already uses a system where the ""driver"" doesn't really drive under normal conditions, they just do the doors and press go. The system regulates the train's speed, brake demand and stopping for stations.

Other countries have driverless underground metro systems and they seem to get on fine. 

Hopefully it will come sooner rather than later - the abuse of union powers by the few to vastly affect the millions of people who live/work in London needs to end (and similarly for heavy rail across the country) - strikes should be for genuine grievances and safety issues, not ""the Olympics are on, I want more money and I know I'll get it because the government won't let a strike happen"" or petty crap like not being allowed to wear union ties.

Here's what I find scary about the ""population centres"" thing. Page 36 on Google Docs:

&gt;I would also say that estimates of weight to attack need to be rather more accurate than those given on page 5 if they are to be useful. As it is, we see that the weight of attack on a large city may be anything from 3 to 30 MT.

Those are both huge.

Virgin may well have something completely different again to handle their TiVo service - similar to how traditional cable video on demand doesn't have to use IP.

The BBC uses Akamai for iPlayer. Do you really think it's a good idea for the BBC to have to procure and maintain extremely high bandwidth links to all of the ISPs to support all of the iPlayer traffic, along with huge server farms and the other necessary infrastructure? Or they could just let Akamai do what they do best.",0,1385857329,null,0,1385857972,0,cdqk15u,t3_1rncdp,t1_cdqk15u,t1_cdqcaki,null,1428447447,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Being sure of themselves does not equate to lying about certainties

as for the things you've brought up

1. BoE is contentious but the governor of the BoE offered yesterday to begin basic talks with the Scottish government about this
2. any EU citizen can use any other EU members Embassy if their particular country is not represented by an Embassy in that country, if when it comes to diplomatic channels the UK (for some reason) decided to be uncooperative then there are plenty of other countries to do deals with on embassies (not necessarily all with the one, ideally not actually)
3. The SG has been quite clear that they will be introducing Scottish citizenship and passports in the event of a yes vote, at the moment I am a British Citizen as is every other Scottish person, a yes vote wouldn't change that, the UK government would still recognise us as citizens of the UK (unless an individual rejects their citizenship) and we would hold dual nationality, that's just how these things go, it's how it went with Ireland 100 years ago. you'll find there'll be plenty give it up and plenty loyal to the UK wont.
4. there is uncertainty around the process for joining the EU (again, thanks Westminster for making sure we are ""as informed as possible"") but the simple fact is the EU will have no reason to not have Scotland, the conditions surrounding membership may be tricky and the negotiations may not work quite how has been expected but ultimately it is the aim of the EU to unite *all* Europe under the EU, casting Scotland out makes absolutely 0 logical sense when you consider the EU as an institution.",0,1385857426,null,0,false,0,cdqk2iz,t3_1rru6k,t1_cdqk2iz,t1_cdqjhyw,null,1428447430,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

&gt; 'Not true' please provide proof on these two counts.

Easy. There is no legislation and none has been proposed. It's true ISPs were pressurised to do this but no legislation was proposed.

On the second point no accounts will be created with filters on. During sign up you will be asked if you want a filter. No filters will be turned on by default. There are plenty of places you can find evidence for this but just try signing up for a talk talk or sky account.

The rest of your post has nothing to do with what I said. But let me address a few things

&gt; 'Filters used to block porn'. Rubbish. These filters will block anything the government can get away with blocking.

These filters will be useless for that because they can be switched off. Surely if the government wants to block something from everyone they will use a method that can't be turned off very easily.

&gt; Having listened to Cameron's disgusting performance during Prime Minister's Question Time I have absolutely no doubt that this law will be used to suppress freedom of the press

What law?

&gt; The Chinese Company that will control 90% of British Internet access has a checkered past..

They supply Talk Talk with their filters, there is zero evidence the other ISPs will use them so that statement is completely unfounded.

&gt; My grandfather did not give his life through service in WW2, nor did my family endure the poverty that ensued as a result of his sacrifice, to have the People's Republic of China control free speech in the UK. Cameron is a knave playing tyrant.

I can kind of guess what the point is for most of the redacted statements, but in this example statement:

&gt; The explanation (given on page 5) is that an enemy would ""aim to achieve ███████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████ factor"". I suggest that MOD should get their scientists to look at this requirement since it has little meaning as stated. For example it is essential that the _kind_ of damage is specified: it could be anything from broken windows to demolition of multi-storey framed buildings.

Obviously that's remarking on reaching a level of capability or capacity. But exactly what capability/capacity? Intercontinental? Neutralising industrial? Exterminating all life in a given zone? Mobility? etc. 

Why is this even considered sensitive? I suppose it might reveal what we knew about the Ruskies, and we don't want them to know what we knew or whatever.

So many questions.

edit: So Annex b (p.45 of pdf) has more information to confirm it is indeed a statement of capability. Two, infact, as it mentions a ""former"" and a ""latter"" and then gives details of how each would be achieved. It seems that the phrase could be anything from 
&gt; ""large scale destruction"" or ""complete devastation""

Burt has often served as AVB's media outlet but also clearly has ties inside Spurs which he seems to go out of his way to ensure he maintains by being very fair in most of his articles related to Spurs (despite the fact that he is a United fan if i recall correctly).

Usually when Burt has a story about Spurs and runs with it there is some truth related to it.  So if he is putting it out there that we have a list we are drawing up it is a bit concerning.

###[The results are horrifying](http://i.imgur.com/f8Ufxxc.png)

I can't find a way to link the 3D nukemap (it struggled to render all those!), annoyingly, but you can get the idea. 

It's amazing how many of these are concentrated up the north-east coast, often right next to each other. I lost count of how often I was dropping bombs within walking distance of the last one. The south-east is surprisingly safe - a cynic would tell you that the ruling class have successfully kept their homelands free of military targets over the years. I grew up just outside Brighton and expected it to be a sheet of glass, but it's all surprisingly doing fine.

###One question I have about this list - what did the author have against the Medway towns?!

Targets 1-89 are perfectly sensible - military installations and the largest cities. Then we get to:

    90. - Gillingham, town
    91. - Rochester, city
    92. - Chatham, town
    93. - Maidstone, town

WTF? Those are the only ""towns"" on the list - everything else is a ""major city"". And they're all so close to each other you could comfortably stroll from detonation to detonation. I can't think of anything there of strategic importance.

Once you're comfortable with torrenting, if you decide you'd like to try private trackers, folks on /r/trackers will usually post when trackers have open sign-ups.  There's also /r/invites, but getting an invite to a private tracker can be hard if you don't already have an account somewhere else.

[You can ignore the rest of this unless you're maybe interested in private trackers.]

Private trackers come in two flavours: general/0-day trackers and specialist trackers.  General trackers are just that: they carry some of everything, mostly stuff that appears everywhere else -- public trackers, other general trackers and even specialist trackers (if the item is part of whatever speciality the tracker follows).

General trackers are a good alternative to public trackers, so you're probably wondering why use them at all.  Mostly because (1) they provide an additional level of security from the MPAA/RIAA/whoever and (2) they can be a stepping-stone to specialty trackers.

Specialty trackers track a specific category of media.  Not only are there trackers that specialise in tv shows, there are trackers that specialise in British, Australian or Canadian programmes, old programmes, or current programmes.  Not only are there trackers that specialise in movies, there are trackers that specialise in foreign movies, cult/B-movies, horror films.  There are trackers that focus on games, on books, on audiobooks, on comics, on documentaries, on Mac software, on pretty much anything you can think of.  Because people on speciality trackers tend to be somewhat passionate about their subject, content on specialty trackers tends to hang around longer than on general trackers, so they build up huge libraries for their subject.

So in private trackers, you can get huge back-catalogues of material and increased security; what're the downsides?  The main one you'll hear is ratio.  On public trackers, you can download whatever you want and then just leave the internet with no consequences.  Private trackers want everyone to participate somewhat fairly, so they'd like you to upload about as much as you download (the percentage of your upload-to-download is your ratio).  A low ratio can get you penalised, while a high ratio can get you benefits.

And that's a fairly decent overview of the private tracker world.  Good luck getting everything set up on your end, and happy torrenting!",0,1385863801,null,0,false,0,cdqmirl,t3_1rpe0g,t1_cdqmirl,t1_cdqkk85,null,1428446285,1,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,1

We fight together to get results and change it round, as **on the pitch we are responsible** for what happens.”

&gt; The German international said the players had spoken amongst themselves about the loss at City, adding: “It’s hard to sleep. It’s not like we just move on with it, it’s hard — it’s not easy for your head. But we have the chance to make it better. If we give everything, fight to the last minute we can get the fans back on our side again.” 

Love Holtby's directness.

&gt; (a)the provision to the applicant of a copy of the information in permanent form or in another form acceptable to the applicant,

&gt; (b)the provision to the applicant of a reasonable opportunity to inspect a record containing the information, and

&gt; (c)the provision to the applicant of a digest or summary of the information in permanent form or in another form acceptable to the applicant,the public authority shall so far as reasonably practicable give effect to that preference.

&gt;(2)In determining for the purposes of this section whether it is reasonably practicable to communicate information by particular means, the public authority may have regard to all the circumstances, including the cost of doing so.

&gt; (3)Where the public authority determines that it is not reasonably practicable to comply with any preference expressed by the applicant in making his request, the authority shall notify the applicant of the reasons for its determination.

&gt; (4)Subject to subsection (1), a public authority may comply with a request by communicating information by any means which are reasonable in the circumstances.


The TL;DR of that is you're allowed to specify how you want the document given to you, and unless it's a ridiculous request they have to agree to it.

I'm guessing you didn't specify ""photo copied in such a way I can't read it"" so you can simply contact them again and specify that you want it so you're able to read it. 

You could even ask for a physical copy of it, they could refuse in theory but I doubt it.

Anyway, if you go off the ages the Doctors give when imprisoned in the tower, there's 400 years between War and 11, 11 giving his age as '1200 and something' but admitting he didn't really know. That would make the War Doctor 800 years old, and when 9 meets Rose he's about 900.

So ok, I'll answer, but I figure you already know the answer and I don't have any thing new, mystical, or surprising to offer. I'm an ex-Chelsea fan (yeah, I know, you think I was never a true fan), and I feel bitter with the very Chelsea specific reasons that turned me off to a club that I did like to a large extent. So I once browsed this sub as (in my mind) a true fan, and I now browse this sub as a still interested ex-fan.

Like anybody that has a complaint about anything, I'd like others to share my view. I get that most don't, and now the only reason I post is on topics that are in line with what turned me off. I do enjoy seeing other people reach my same conclusion.  Or coming close. Or just seeing other scenarios that are similar to what turned me off. As the revolving door of players goes on and the ones I knew from my brief time as a fan exit, so too will my interest in the club, and my interest in posting.

That's all there is. I am pretty certain you already knew I'm an ex-fan. I don't really know what else to say, I don't actually think I've said anything new to you here, but this is the best explanation I have, if you really want to press me on it.

So, yeah, I know, ""oh you're a plastic fan"" and all that. And as you can guess, my retort is ""well I'm not a blind follower"", so it goes. I think it is admirable to have standards and you can only hope the team you support lives up to your standards. For me, that is the very reason to support a team.

Even at the worst point this sub is better than /r/gunners and dont even get me started on your amazing mods which you can read about in my profile plenty of times. Invading subs, creating profiles to provide score updates, power trips, know fuck all about football let alone your own club, and I'm not even talking about the userbase yet just your mods.

This is coming from one of the people on the same side as those who you mentioned above.

We know at /r/Chelseafc things will boil over heck we can even improve it after getting our word in but but if we had your fan base, your mods and the atracious posts you circlejerk about 20 times worse than the problems we mention here which is the entire reason this is happening, we would just give up and throw our laptops and phones away never to bother visiting the site again due to giving up.

P.S : We have 2 Chelsea subs the second with less than 40 members, yours is devided into half a dozen subs with thousands in each one. The posts mocking your own fan base are also public on those unlike how we deal with our problems privately. 

An Arsenal fan is the last person deserving to come here and gloat but then again your biggest acheivement is invading other subs as the kids in your team shit their pants every year when the league gets to when the position and wins really matters. At least the lads here who picked the club recently have European trophies to gloat about while this is as good as it gets for fans like you who wanted to be hipster and edgy picking the club off Fifa.

- /r/GunnersAtGames (no we are the real fans who leave the stadium while losing)
- /r/Gunnersjerk (time to show how shit the main sub is becoming)

I think a lot of people are confusing the intention or purpose of the loan.. we didn't send him out as a test or just to gain first team playing time because we had no need for him, we did it for him to develop his all around abilities on his own under pressure.. the more shit he does and the more times he fucks up the better. None of us are expecting him to become a first team threat for another 2-3 years but by then we are expecting a lot from him.. suso right now has no intention of displacing anybody, its not a case of 'prove yourself' we already know exactly how talented he is but its because we know this that everybody wants and expects results as soon as possible rather than in a few seasons (as with most 'wonderkids')

sure he goes for the 'hollywood' balls a lot and he holds onto the ball and his shooting is all over the place but he should be doing it, **this is the time to be doing it**, he will develop the skill and learn as he goes, we have no time for that developmental experimental shit during first team games here not while he's at his level which although is high at times is also inconsistent and its not quite the same intensity in training.. you think Alonso just woke up one morning and found out he could put the ball anywhere he wants on the pitch? it came from hours and hours of putting it anywhere but where he wanted it to be and as they say 'you win or you learn'

too many times i see 'but he's not as good as/enough to replace Coutinho' or something along them lines, which is an *extremely* harsh comparison to make considering Coutinho in his own right is already a rare exception to the rule.. he's a super talented kid thats good enough to develop as he plays in the first team at the highest level! on the pitch he's pretty much allowed to do whatever he likes thats why we see him taking shots more often and the odd free kick and the odd corner, he's developing and learning while he plays, the same thing suso is doing in spain although at the moment Coutinho is playing at a much higher level that allows him to do so here in the first team without putting us at risk. Suso has all the right stuff to be just as good as Coutinho but we cant bare the same risk yet, theres a reason both madrid and barca wanted him

sorry for the rant! and sorry if it goes off in places or i only touch on things briefly i was trying to keep this as short and sweet as possible but I've been on a number of forums tonight and the amount of misdirection and understanding is shocking, I might do a separate post of our 'wonderkids' and what makes them special tomorrow or monday",0,1385874611,null,0,1385874797,0,cdqqgop,t3_1rszwr,t1_cdqqgop,t3_1rszwr,null,1428444373,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7

The Telegraph (and the Mail) have some bizarre vendetta against social workers, but I'd wait to hear the details of this case before coming to any judgements. It is very very difficult for social services to remove a child from parents. Indeed, social workers are more often criticised for not having removed a child, but such action is always a last resort. If this story is true (and I am skeptical) it has gone before a judge to make a decision. That suggests exceptional circumstances. 

To give an example, what if this Italian woman was mentally ill, and convinced her unborn child was the devil? What if, with this belief, she had stabbed herself in the stomach, and gave every indication she would try again? Would a court order to have the child removed by c-section still seem unreasonable?

I really get sick of the bashing elements of the right wing press give social workers. It is a difficult job, poorly paid, with little thanks, where you are often just as criticised for taking an action as you are for not taking an action.

Dicks, who is a major figure in Doctor Who and a great author to boot, failed miserably. The Eight Doctors is just one huge slice of fanwank that failed at the worst time. 

To give some perspective, after the TV Movie, The Virgin New Adventures (the current book range at the time) were cancelled to make way for the Eighth Doctor Adventures. Now, Virgin wasn't huge by any means, but they were innovative, and loved by a small but devoted group of fandom. The EDA's weren't allowed to tackle the same adult topics that the New Adventures dealt with regularly, and with the apparent shift of writers, many worried that the new range was going to be ""dumbed down"". So, to prove that the EDA's were worth doing, the pilot had to really stick the landing. 

It didn't. This remained an ongoing problem with the EDA's, as they were stuffed full of great material but always failed to deliver on the crucial moments.

true,thomasfk,lfcflame,,"I have had many experiences on these types of injuries, so might be able to help give an idea of what the procedure and recovery time is for something like this.

I have actually had severe ankle sprains on both ankles before, one of which was so badly swollen that scans were inconclusive, much like what is happening with Sturridge. Although in Daniel's case, it says the bruising is preventing the doctors from getting an accurate assessment. Maybe it's one in the same? One thing is for certain though, if it is severe bruising, particularly near the heel of your foot, it is most likely a sprain and not a break. The article pretty much confirms it is a sprain and not a break, so what's stated checks out so far. Obviously, the first measure is to be extra cautious so a cast was put on in case it was broken for a day or two until the swelling went down and I could get another scan. If it's a break, you get a cast or boot on. If it's a sprain, you'll just wear a compression cast for a few days to keep the swelling down.

Once a lot of the initial swelling and pain has subsided, you can begin your physical therapy to restrengthen the ligaments. Depending on the severity of his injury, it could take anywhere from 3 to 6 weeks would be my guess. Mine was much longer though. It was a very bad sprain and took probably 10 weeks. I've had others that were less severe where I came back after 3-4 weeks. Chances are that if they couldn't get a good reading on the first scan, it is more badly sprained and it will be at the upper end of the recovery time.

Section 136 of the Mental Health Act allows for the police to take someone who is at risk to themselves or others to a ""place of safety"". Yes, it really is that ambiguous. That is probably how she was taken to the hospital.

There she would have been assessed by a psychiatrist and most likely placed under a section 4 hold (Think that's the one, I'll need to check) which allows for treatment of a mental health disorder. 

However, and this is a key point, treatment under the mental health act can **only** be for a mental health condition. A Caesarean section is not a treatment for bipolar disorder and so could not be performed under the mental health act. 

There is more going on here than is being reported.

Edit: Here is more information on the different sections of the Mental Health Act which cover treatment of mental health http://www.rethink.org/living-with-mental-illness/mental-health-laws/mental-health-act-1983/sections-2-3-4-5 

Situations where I could feasibly see an emergency caesarean section being done against someone's will would have to include a life threatening condition. And even then it could only happen if the patient was deemed not to have capacity and only if the caesarean section were in the patient's best interests. Important to note that being detained under a section of the Mental Health Act does not rid you of capacity.

I'm not aware of that being a valid reason to keep a child from her mother. My aunt for instance is severely schizophrenic and goes properly mental if she's off her medication. Her daughter has needed to be temporarily placed in care on a few occasions whilst the doctors worked to get her mind back into the same world as her body, but at no point did anyone suggest putting the child up for adoption.

Permanently taking a child away from her mother is a drastic action and my understanding was that it is only considered in cases of chronic abuse or neglect, not when the mother has a single episode of illness followed by a full recovery, based solely on a judge's concern that she might become ill again in the future.

There are benefits to this though - its most likely bills included which will be cheaper for the lodger. Also things like bad heating,  broken things etc will be fixed much quicker as the landlord is there too. 
Also you are likely to avoid agency fees. Just make sure you still sign a contract - you still get one month notice (for both parties).

We know nothing of the details, fuckit, it may even be that the women has relapses every year and has been into care several times herself.


Anyway, if the baby was at risk of harm then the correct procedures were carried out.

Women was sent to a professional to asses her mental state and found to be a risk to other persons (in this case her baby), the doctor informed social services about the risk who then sought judge approval to remove the persons from harm.

Thats three different levels to jump through the various hoops in order to remove the persons at harm from the women, I trust the system enough to say that there would be a extremely small chance of all 3 levels being incompetent to rubberstamp it.


Also why is she claiming the baby back after 15 months?  Anyway the bias in the telegraph is strong and they either don't have the full facts, or are reporting it in a way that suits their motives.

true,hebsevenfour,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"Let me be frank - there is no system of social services that we would want that will be free from mistakes. None. The notion that social workers, trying to do their best under horrific circumstances, should be vilified because of this is both absurd and disgusting. It's only the bad stories that hit the press, because the vast majority of what they do helps and people are protected by confidentiality. 

I used to work in children's services (not children's social care) and I was directly involved in two cases where children were removed from their families, but that's against a background of hundreds of cases were children were not, and families were supported to help with their circumstances. Social workers often work absurdly long hours, on cases where there is no ""right option"". They have to make judgement calls based on the information at hand, and sometimes that call will be wrong, but the majority of the time it isn't. 

What is it you're advocating? Having no social workers, and just leaving abused kids where they are? 

As a profession, it's already hard to attract graduates. It's tough, often heart-breaking stuff, long hours, shit pay, and you very rarely get thanks (but you can be sure if you make a mistake it will be seriously criticised).

Thats one of the main reasons the UN was set up, to break up the Empire and fuck over US), stopped the slave trade and did so much more that ruffled feathers of bad guys the world over. 

And the ones who propagate this idea more than anyone else are those of the Irish Catholic Diaspora. In America and the commonwealth at the heart of anti Englishness or Republicanism (as in against the monarchy, not American Republicanism) at its heart is Irish Catholics. 

There is a lot of anti Englishness in Hollywood as well. There are two types of bad guys in Movies, the bad guy of the moment, Germans in the Second World War, Russians in the Cold War, Muslims now, or if you dont want to use one of them theres always the timeless bad guy, an Englishman. 

We are also culturally superior to just about everyone on the planet.

We also invented any game worth playing. 

All of this has created quite an inferiority complex amongst the peasant countries that are envious of everything we are including our glorious history.

In either case, interesting decisions in dropping Holtby and starting Chadli, glad Dembele and Vlad are on the pitch though. Can't really blame him for trying different options after last week, although I don't personally think Chadli is a better option against United than Lamela, Townsend, or Siggy.

EDIT: I have a theory. Lennon and Chadli are playing as true wingers, which means no inverted cut-in-and-shoot style of play. Willing to bet you we see a few more crosses than normal tonight, with ~~Lamela~~ Siggy and/or Townsend coming on at 60min. 

Depending on the scoreline, at 75min we see Capoue or Holtby in for Sandro/Dembele (respectively)

further, a point raised recently was that when the USSR collapsed, west and east Germany were unified and east Germany (15 million people) was brought into the EU in a period of 10 months, i hardly think Scotland would have nearly as rough a ride as that and so i think 18 months is more than enough time to get EU membership.

For instance, consider the infamous *Protect and Survive* booklet released following the Civil Defence Review of the late 1970s. There is no reference to evacuation. Exercise Hard Rock, the planned test run of civil service capability in case of nuclear attack (which did not run due to non-participation from numerous local authorities) [did not include any provision for evacuation.](https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~wgreen/ECDhardrock.html)

Furthermore, if you read the report put out in the early 1980s, it points out that if every single bed in Britain was available it wouldn't be sufficient to deal with the wounded from a single, normal-sized British city. There was little that could meaningfully be done in that context. It's a matter of fact that Britain's nuclear policy vis-a-vis Russia was to ensure that Britain's arsenal could meet the 'Moscow Criterion' of being able to destroy Moscow and the central command there. We relied on the ABM systems of the United States to save what civilians we can.

Small wonder that most new builds are poky boxes. This is the London perspective btw; property supply is intentionally constrained since 'a roof is a roof' - people need to live somewhere so they will pay what they have to. As such, property developers won't kill the golden goose by developing their land too quickly. New builds are unaffordable for the majority without a government scheme and, anecdotally, people will pay 15-25% over the estate agents' valuation for properties.

Your sizing of the nuclear warheads is completely wrong. 3MT is insanely high for a target that isn't a London-sized city.

Besides, why wipe out every minor city when you can target the C3 capabilities instead with smaller warheads and achieve the same results; inability to return fire.

They specially modified a few bombers to carry it iirc. 

But there's a serious point here. 
&gt;the largest nuke in *current* use

These days of course we have highly accurate missiles, able to hit down to a few metres without error. By contrast, pre-GPS and good computers - guidance systems, from the 50s to about the mid-70s, *sucked*. Both sides had intercontinental rockets, but if the Soviets launch one in Siberia aimed at London, there's no guarantee it'll go off directly over Downing Street. It might just as easily hit Reading.

The thinking at that time was to compensate with MORE POWER. Bombs were *huge* in the 50s/60s - who cares if you're ten miles off target when the blast radius is twenty? They have actually got significantly less powerful as accuracy has improved. A war fifty years ago would have caused much, much more collateral damage. So yes, multi-MT weaponry against the most significant capital cities is highly likely back then (remember this assessment is dated 1972).

I think with a target like London multiple bombs would definitely be used. [Intermediate-range ballistic missiles](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02684529908432540) from Eastern Europe were notoriously primitive, outdated designs still in active service - they were liquid-fueled, and once scrambled for fuelling could only wait so long because the fuel was so corrosive, potentially escalating any decision to fire them or not.  
Larger warheads generally came on bigger rockets - ICBMs - from further away, so while secondary cities maybe only got an IRBM hit from Europe, they'd want London fully dealt with.  
Finally, the only accurate way to hit significant targets - military bunkers, for instance - remained flying a bomber in for close-range targeting.

London, like Moscow, would have a ridiculous amount of bombs inbound at once. Nobody was taking chances on its survival.",0,1385902947,null,0,false,0,cdqw5od,t3_1rsngc,t1_cdqw5od,t1_cdquy8r,null,1428441716,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

true,Kesuke,null,null,"These are very unrealistic assumptions they've made. There is also a huge fallacy in the idea that you can simply divide up MoD equipment and assets to build an army out of it. 

I'll use the challenger 2 tank as an example off the top of my head (although I admit I don't think the SNP want to operate an MBT Tank - but its just an example); the British Army originally ordered 386 Challenger 2's, of which about 300 are still operational I believe. So the SNP might come along and say ""Well, by population share we'll take 8% of them - 35 tanks"". Very easy isn't it? **Actually not**. The problem is the tanks themselves only make up a relatively small part of the actual tank assets. The repair, maintenance and storage facilities are located around Catterick, Tidworth, Windsor, Swanton Morley, Warminster, Honington and of course Bovington. Now we aren't just talking about a couple of crates of spanners... these are high tech devices with custom tools/cranes etc. that are physically built into the bases. Moving hundred ton cranes that were built in situ isn't going to be very practical... so if the Scots wanted to operate the tanks they'd have to build their own facilities... and that isn't going to be cheap. Then they'll need training and proving grounds, munitions etc... What about staffing? It might not be very straightforward to simply cleave the maintenance crews in 2 - especially when the lot going to Scotland are going to only be working on 35 chassis - that might not be economically practical. Then, and most importantly, you have to consider - what good would it actually be to have a tank force of 35 tanks... without the Royal Navy Fleet Auxillary ships to move them around the world, or the staging bases to move them to overseas, or the ability to move them in heavy lift aircraft to the combat area in a timely fashion...


Dividing armies up like this just isn't practical. You end up with two halves less than the sum of their parts. It is much more likely, in the event of independence, the Scots will **have** to enter into some sort of mutual defense programme at least in the short term.

I also question  the ability of an independent Scotland to actually recruit anywhere near the numbers they are talking about - after all, Soldiers don't join armies to sit in barrack rooms cleaning boots... they join because they want money, adventure and to fight (particularly in the British Army).  What prospects would there be for these soldiers in an independent Scottish army? At best they would be a big fish in a small pond - and while there will be some takers, I suspect for many (given that soldiers are generally reputation and respect orientated people) would sooner not be associated with the Scottish defense force. The idea that you can just magically create more infantry overnight is absurd - particularly when the officer training college and most of the garrisons are located in the South East of England for the same historical reasons that the submarine facilities are located in the north - the threat from Germany in WW1 &amp; 2.

The defense plans for Scotland really ought to be highlighted - because it's (to my mind anyway) probably the single weakest part of their plans, and really doesn't hold up to scrutiny. Above all else, if you look at what serving British personnel are saying (including the Scottish), there really isn't any appetite for it. Scots personnel are, for fairly obvious reasons, relatively unionist in their outlook. I'm just not convinced an independent Scotland is going to be able to woo them into leaving what they know (and what they are proud of) for something that has ""cheap and minimal"" stamped all over it.",0,1385905047,null,0,1385905724,0,cdqwhi9,t3_1rru6k,t1_cdqwhi9,t3_1rru6k,null,1428441563,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

You ready?! Let's go!
Yeah, for those of you that want to know what we're all about
It's like this y'all (c'mon!)

&gt; [Chorus:]
This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name!

Mike! - He doesn't need his name up in lights
He just wants to be heard whether it's the beat or the mic
He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him
But fuck em, he knows the code
It's not about the salary
It's all about reality and making some noise
Making the story - making sure his clique stays up
That means when he puts it down Tak's picking it up! Let's go!

Who the hell is he anyway?
He never really talks much
Never concerned with status but still leaving them star struck
Humbled through opportunities given despite the fact
That many misjudge him because he makes a living from writing raps
Put it together himself, now the picture connects
Never asking for someone's help, or to get some respect
He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach
And now it all unfolds, the skill of an artist

This is twenty percent skill
Eighty percent fear
Be a hundred percent clear cause Ryu is ill
Who would've thought that he'd be the one to set the west in flames
And I heard him wreck it with The Crystal Method, ""Name Of The Game""
Came back dropped Megadef, took em to church
I like bleach man, why you had the stupidest verse?
This dude is the truth, now everybody's giving him guest spots
His stock's through the roof I heard he's fuckin' with S. Dot!

[Chorus]

They call him Ryu, he's sick
And he's spitting fire
And mike got him out the dryer he's hot
Found him in Fort Minor with Tak
What a fuckin' nihilist porcupine
He's a prick, he's a cock
The type woman want to be with, and rappers hope he get shot
Eight years in the making, patiently waiting to blow
Now the record with Shinoda's taking over the globe
He's got a partner in crime, his shit is equally dope
You wont believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat

Tak! - He's not your everyday on the block
He knows how to work with what he's got
Making his way to the top
He often gets a comment on his name
People keep asking him was it given at birth
Or does it stand for an acronym?
No he's living proof, got him rocking the booth
He'll get you buzzing quicker than a shot of vodka with juice
Him and his crew are known around as one of the best
Dedicated to what they do and give a hundred percent

Forget Mike - Nobody really knows how or why he works so hard
It seems like he's never got time
Because he writes every note and he writes every line
And I've seen him at work when that light goes on in his mind
It's like a design is written in his head every time
Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
And those motherfuckers he runs with,
The kids that he signed?
Ridiculous, without even trying,
How did he do it?!

[Chorus - repeat 2x]

[Outro - Mike Shinoda:]
Yeah! Fort Minor
M. Shinoda - Styles of Beyond
Ryu! Takbir! Machine Shop!

There was a newspaper article my A-level politics teacher read out to us from shortly after the FOI Act was passed. Some journalist had requested that the Department for Health and Safety (or some similar department of government) list all the various accidents which had taken place in the Department for Health and Safety. The rest of the article was basically a list of all the different accidents that had occurred. Someone, apparently, managed to injure themselves by slipping on a raisin.

Anyway, so then the law was rectified to stop people wasting government resources on how many people slipped up on raisins. Normal FOI requests, like the on in the OP, usually cost next to nothing and are the vital stuff which the FOI Act was passed for.

No ifs, no buts.  The vast majority of the country think it's time but the most you'll get from the other 3 is a jam-tomorrow promise.  It's a central tenet of UKIP.  They also have a policy of direct democracy, that is binding local and national referendums on domestic matters, backed by independent Royal Commissions to make sure both side of the story gets out.

----------------------------------

**They're anti tuition fees and pro student grants.**  

Labour brought them, and cut the grants, the Tories doubled down, and the LibDems who were supposedly championing the student cause and higher education folded like a cheap suit.

-----------------

**They're anti privatisation of the NHS, and pro putting local authorities in control.**  

Under Labour the NHS received layers and layers of bureaucracy.  Even Labour that introduced Primary Care Trusts were slashing away at their numbers within a few short years, and look at how they financed building hospitals - we'll be haemorrhaging NHS and council money into private hands for decades to come.  Look at the mess the Conservatives inherited and they've not done any better.   Okay, so they inherited ATOS but what have they done to fix it and not make it worse?  The LibDems; everytime, fold like a cheap suit.

At least UKIP have a working plan.  Everything stays free at the point of entry when you go into hospital.  Local authorities with local fiscal powers will decide what hospitals and services stay open.  And ATOS?  Well they've got a disability spokesperson that's a lawyer that's actually gone through it being in a wheelchair.  As an immediate game changer before overhauling and reviewing the system they advocate two very simple, cost effective changes to deliver maximum results.  (A)  You allow a claimant to sign a release so their medical records relative to the claim can be included in their form, as such they're not going into an appraisal on their own trying to prove their disability but effectively they have their GP with them and the burden is on ATOS to disprove the GP.  (B) Instead of waiting for an appeal before you actually can have a physical  doctor in the room all appraisals will be done within a month WITH an NHS doctor in the room.  So effectively ATOS will have to overturn two doctors to reject a valid claim, or one NHS doctor will have to call out your own NHS GP's findings - effectively putting his own professional judgement on the line.  Nobody will be going into an ATOS meeting without medical professionals.

So you see, some good things do come from having lupus!

They're pro localism; giving local counties and authorities more say on local matters, local fiscal powers, and keeping more of the locally raised revenue.  Could be a point on its own, but it applies well to local services like the NHS.

-------------------

**They're the  only party that has a real policy to deliver affordable long term energy.**  

Everybody else is talking about offsetting or temporary freezing, subsidising renewables which actual drives up the price of gas due to EU primacy laws which eat into gas profits so they have to charge more.  Higher energy prices only serve to send more manufacturing to Asia where they don't really have any qualms about building new coal power stations.  UKIP's the only one with the common sense attitude that says the coal powerstations that we already have shouldn't be closed early whilst there's so much cheap US coal on the market, and that we should get fracking YESTERDAY so our own coal becomes cheaper.

Road and rail transport would be ruined (because it primarily links places which are all targets), as would communication and so little of the local authorities would remain intact there would be no way to coordinate any actions. And this is precisely what the Russians were planning. The only defense against this is to have the ability to do the same to the Soviets (or at least the populated bits of Western Russia and places the Soviets had troops in Eastern Europe). 

And this is why there has never been a nuclear war, even though tensions between the Soviets and USA were far higher than between other nations at the start of either of the world wars. If it wasn't for nuclear weapons then the cold war would have gone hot, and it would be very likely that the Soviets would have taken Europe. So, in a way, the fact that it would take a few hours to kill tens of millions of people is why there haven't been any direct wars between great powers for nearly 70 years, and why the world we live in is actually very peaceful compared to the world our great grandparents lived in.

Liked that we looked aggressive in attack all day, still need to work on taking advantage of the chances that we create.

Really was impressed by Lennon today.  Hard working shift as always and his link with Walker is always better than anyone else we put on the right.  He may not be my first choice on the right but you can see how he is an effective choice in certain matches.

Thought Chadli looked good for a guy who has been banged up for awhile, certainly a much more rounded player on the left than we have been playing.  Some of his passes down in the final third were giving Jan a bit too much to chase after and at times on attack he dropped a bit deeper than i would have liked but i think there is a bit of promise in his play, the fact that he is truly two footed and can take on a defender adds a bit to the team.

Overall i was happy with the performance, we had our issues here and there but was a good rebound match following a match where we looked shit from start to finish.  We looked positive and aggressive in attack (though still lacking on the final product), loved the way that Dembele and Sandro looked with each other in the middle of the pitch, would be interesting to see what may come with Eriksen in the lineup with those two.

It is often wrongly interpreted that Scotland is subsidised by the rest of the UK, because public spending is £1,200 higher per head than in other parts of the country. However, on average Scots generate £10,700 per head in taxes compared to £9,000 per head in the rest of the United Kingdom, meaning Scotland actually receives £500 per head less than it contributes back from Westminster. Furthermore, in February 2012, the Centre for Economics and Business Research concluded that ""Scotland receives no net subsidy"" from the United Kingdom treasury.

Add to this Scottish contributions to defence spending (£ 3 billion), other projects (HS2), and repayment of a national debt largely run up by England, and, according to some, Scotland gets substantially less than it is gives.

This video is from an entertainment show https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kstH-8jwa80 but it does provide a few quotes that you can also do some research into.

The Dalai Lama is actually a pretty power-crazy guy, and Tibetan Buddhism isn't all it's cracked up to be in the equality, peace-loving non-discrimination sense.  Not to say that the Chinese aren't frickin' terrible in Tibet, but the Tibetans were effectively living in serfdom before the invasion anyway.

Having said that, I don't really have any strong views on the guy; he's no worse than a lot of other political leaders and he also does a lot of good in the world.  Researching into his background and Tibet in general is a good way to spend a night though.  Remember to read between the lines - a lot of Chinese info paints him as the devil while Tibet-in-Exile info paints him as the second coming of Jesus, so take everything with a grain of salt - the truth will lie somewhere between.",0,1385908138,null,0,false,0,cdqx24k,t3_1rsqh2,t1_cdqx24k,t1_cdqmbft,null,1428441297,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Y'up.  

And I watch videos like this and reflect on how they've called it right!

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CZr17HLH5U

&gt;anti: immigration

Nope.

They're anti uncontrolled immigration.  They're actually PRO controlled, net immigration. 

&gt;anti: gay

Nope.

The UKIP leader of the London Assembly is openly gay, and the number one MEP nominee in Scotland.  They were pro the civil partnership act in 2004, even campaigning for it.
 
They also have a UKIP LGBT group.  [I still chuckle when I read their catchline: Britain should be out...and proud.](https://twitter.com/ukiplgbt)

&gt;anti: European Court of Human Rights

Anti the European Court of Human Rights encroaching on protections that should be afforded to every UK citizen!  They're not doing it because they want less rights but MORE!  As in we won't allow you to be deported unless we see the evidence first and you get to address it in this country.  Innocent UK people have spent months upon months in foreign rotting jail cells without being charged!

&gt;anti: green energy

They actually say that if you want to pay for it as an individual, a local community, or a business then fine, but that they won't subsidise it.

You say anti green energy, they say pro affordable energy.  You can't have both.

&gt;The economic plans outlined by UKIP have been called into question by The Times, who have highlighted a “£120 billion black hole” in their spending plans

Called into question that was immediately answered.  The Times article completely forget to mention how it would be introduced and phased in and went with the assumption that everything would be done on day one, which no government has ever done.

It comes across as if there is 'no other choice'.  The pound is not an asset, it's a unit of currency.  if it's an asset it can be divided.  You can't have half of the concept of a pound.  

The UK could agree to a currency union, but it would involve UK control of some of Scotland's policies, without Scottish representation in a UK parliament.

This is even less democratic a deal than the Euro countries get.

the 90/10% oil split.  It might make logical/legal sense, but unlikely to happen in the real world.  Some would be given up in exchange for other concessions.  A lot of the economic proposals are based on oil money or getting money back from not contributing tax revenue to trident etc.  These won't happen overnight and may not happen at all.

The assumption that negotiations will take 18 months and that it will be possible to negotiation EU entry whilst still part of the UK.

Basically nothing is guaranteed.  If scotland voted yes, they should leave the UK, and then negotiate for what is required.  The fact Scotland was once a separate country hundreds of years ago does not matter.  Lots of regions/territories/smaller nations were.  The rest of the world doesn't care.  As far as Europe and the UN is concerned this is a new country emerging on the world stage.

Maintaining the uk's rebate etc. from the EU.  This was given because the UK is a big economy and has a bit of clout.  It shouldn't be assumed that Scotland would get the same deal.  Bigger countries than scotland don't get it.

I think most people will vote based on how they feel than any logic.

I could campaign and vote for South east england to have independence from the UK, it might be better off, but I feel English and I feel British.  I feel like I have a stake in the rest of the UK.

I don't think they would abandon the principles of the convention; but it's likely that the 90/10 split is going to have to be as negotiable as anything else.  It may end up 80/20 or 70/30 depending on what the rest of the Uk is prepared to give way on etc.

A reasonable example would be uk government land/insitutions in scotland - it might simple not be possible to 'give' 10% of all of them to scotland - the split for some things might be more sensible at 20 or 30%, as such maybe the oil split would change accordingly.

Assuming everything, individually would be 90/10 doesn't make sense to me.

EU states with separatist movements aren't likely to want things to go smoothly for a breakaway region of the UK.

You ask some good questions - do the SNP have answers to this?  how will scotland be run financially during the period that it's not in the UK or the EU?  

I'm not saying it's not possible, but it seems as if voting Yes, would mean accepting a decade or so of temporary pain to get what yes voters want.

As such, i'd not vote yes for the sake of improvements to the economy/life, but purely because I didn't feel part of the UK any more.

A bit like, if for whatever historical reason the Uk and germany were one country, and the time had come where the UK felt it wanted to run its own affairs, even if that meant a reduction in quality of life.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"Food goes up and down, it's currently going up, exotic and out of season food has historically come down dramatically, but nonetheless you called it reasonably accurately for what's been happening recently, technology tends to come down dramatically once it's off the bleeding edge, and once it gets fully commoditised it becomes ridiculously cheap.  Cheap plastic shit from Asia is also orders of magnitude cheaper than the Western equivalents used to be (to the individual, probably not to the planet).  Non-discretionary spending is increasing significantly though, and takes up a larger proportion of most ordinary people's budgets.

Lots of theories about inflation abound - why we have it, to what extent it's created and controllable or a natural and inevitable economic phenomenon, how desirable/harmful it is at particular levels etc.  Certainly there is a relationship between inflation and unemployment (low inflation correlates to some extent higher unemployment and vice versa). Inflation targets are set, and in traditional economics it's usually thought that a little bit of inflation is good - mostly to protect against deflation, which is seen as a dangerous downward spiral where prices decrease, so production grinds to a halt because it's harder to make profits with your inputs becoming relatively more expensive by the time you get your outputs - but also to stimulate people to spend and/or invest rather than to simply sit on their money.  High inflation is usually seen as bad though as it robs people of their savings, particularly those who aren't tightly tied into the corridors of power, or who get their money late in the game (e.g. people who are paid salaries as opposed to investment houses and banks).  Inflation/high inflation favours debtors, deflation/low inflation favours creditors/savers and those on fixed incomes...

true,Calavera190,scottish,Fife,"Does it matter whether Scotland benefited financially from the Union in the past? Yes, Scotland may have benefited, but this was not as a result of brotherly love on the part of England, it was brought about by action designed to benefit the political and social elite, who mainly gravitated around London. But this is history, as so is meaningless in any discussion on Scotland and the UK's future.

We're talking about today, and tomorrow. And, as it stands, I feel Scotland to be losing out. It contributes £3 billion to an ineffective defence plan, leaving it £1 billion out of pocket per annum, with no surface navy vessels permanently stationed in Scottish waters, the highest MoD redundancy rate within the UK, the scrapping of historic regiments of immense local and national pride, dilapidated bases (Leuchars), the scrapping of profitable, popular airshows which bring thousands to the local economy (Leuchars again), no capacity for naval territory patrols and, lest we forget, two aircraft carries with no aircraft. However, this can be said for most the UK, and is really the result, I feel, of inept ministers rather than a deliberate attempt to syphon money from Scotland. The fact of the matter is the whole of the UK spends more on defence than it needs to, and what we do spend goes towards the wrong things. 

However, there are other areas where Scottish money is being squandered for the benefit of (usually) Greater London.

Such as HS2. Scotland is contributing millions in tax towards it, even though it is expected to drain £393 million from the Scottish economy. Wales and East Anglia can also expect to lose millions; whilst London is expected to gain £3 billion from the line, the lion's share of a scheme that was *supposed* to bring money and jobs to the North.

The same can also be said of the national debt. One economist has calculated that the Union has cost Scotland £64 billion over 32 years, as a result of it paying for debts run up in England. However, I am not an economist, as so cannot independently verify his results; although it is true that Scotland is the richest area in the UK outside of London and the South East, and has consistently ran up a smaller spending deficit than the UK average. 

In short, the problems Scotland faces is one faced by most areas of the UK, the dominance of London and the South East in terms of government spending. Look at all the new airports around London, look at how little investment there has been in Northern airports. Look at the £70 the government spends on culture in London per person, look at the £5 per person on culture in the rest of England. Look at HS2. £3 billion for London, £393 million from Scotland, £151 million from South Essex, £101 million from Bristol. These losses do not even take into account the tax contributed to the damaging scheme.

Boris himself claimed a pound spent in Croydon benefits the whole country more than a pound spent in Strathclyde, or any other regional centre.

Yes. Your argument is based purely on financial figures. So the historic context of those figures is not only extremely relevant, but entirely pivotal. 

&gt;We're talking about today.

You're reducing the scope of refutement purely to benefit your side of the argument and attempt to shut down contrary facts. Generally a shrewd tactic, when not used so transparently. However I would counter it would be pertinent to look at the historical benefit and cost of Union in its entirety. What use is arguing solely over today when to do so we have to consider the past and future. You cannot state something is happening now and use it as justification for an action without first considering whether whatever is happening is due to a historical reason and whether the situation will improve or worsen in future.

All your examples are almost parroted from a Wings of Scotland article, and I honestly have no interest in verifying them so I will happily assume you are correct. Neither am I going to counter it with benefits of Union because I have argued with you people before and I have long since learnt no amount of facts or figures changes your mind.

What I will say is this. Constant threats and dillydallying over a vote to leave the UK faced with all the uncertainties that brings, is a position Scotland ought really to consider whether it wishes to maintain. No sane business, immigrant or investment can consider Scotland without some level of assurance of stability or access to whatever it needs.

Most of the match was played in Liverpool's half, no one in white even realized Suarez was on the pitch--let alone find him with a decent ball--and possession was wasted time and time again.

I thought Skrtel was great, Flanagan turned up well which is a good sign, he seems to be a gamer, extremely unlucky day for Mignolet, two deflections and a sideshow of a defensive effort for the 2nd goal.  Suarez did nothing today, I hope his knee is alright.  Moses I'm not going to comment on, Sterling I thought improved as the game went on.  

Raheem has all the physical tools, we just need to figure out a way to get his brain to work as quickly as the rest of his body.  Even playing relatively poorly his pace created a few chances for us from absoutely nothing when the ball drops right for him which is huge in a game like today where there's NO creativity.


Also, I find Henderson really ineffective once we get about 25 yards away from goal.  He's very useful the rest of the time because he covers so much ground and usually has the highest work rate on the pitch but once we get inside about 25-30 yards those qualities mean less as the field becomes congested.  

When those situations arise he always seems to be a step slow or his touch seems to fail him, his passes are too heavy and he can't (or doesn't) really deliver a killer ball into the box in a central role.  It's one of the things I think will stop him from being a top player for a CL side if he doesn't improve on it.

Sturridge scored a great goal against Villa, scored off two mistakes vs Swansea, SAS won us the game vs Sunderland, Suarez won us a pen and created the other for Sturridge vs Newcastle. We haven't had a single good away performance this season. 

Anyone who has watched Hull this season would know how tight they make the game, they have 5 at the back with Huddlestone sitting, and three other midfielders pressing. I can see why Rodgers thought Moses and Sterling could give us width. But we have no link in midfield, Henderson cannot do it, for all his hard work he has very little quality on the ball. Lucas should have been taken off, moving Hendo back and putting Coutinho behind Suarez. It was incredibly important to find a way to get between the center backs and wing backs, but we had nobody in a position to make that pass. Rodgers selection away from home in general is really questionable.

So many changes in defence can't have helped, but Skrtel and Toure have been shown up today and vs Arsenal. Sakho has to play, the question is who will play with him.

Flanagan was awful, he is not a left back.

I'm not one for knee jerk reactions, but this has been a long time coming. We do not control games, we don't look like we have a plan away from home and still cannot play out from the back. 

How on earth can we be so bad at playing out from the back when that is arguably the only big change Rodgers made since taking over. Skrtel always looks uncomfortable, Mignolet does not like having the ball at feet.

true,Calavera190,scottish,Fife,"&gt;You're reducing the scope of refutement purely to benefit your side of the argument and attempt to shut down contrary facts. Generally a shrewd tactic, when not used so transparently.

I reduce the scope as other information is irrelevant. Scotland made money from the Union as the Union made money from the Empire. We no longer have an empire, rendering this fact meaningless.

&gt;What use is arguing solely over today when to do so we have to consider the past and future.

Incorrect; not only am I attempting to prove the Union fails to deliver today, I argue that it shows no sign of changing in the future. People, mainly, want to leave not because they dislike the Union, but because the Union fails to deliver, they feel, a net benefit due to the broken political system. From where they stand, it is easier to leave and start afresh then to try and bring about constitutional reform in the UK that would address London's domination of UK politics, a domination that stretches back centuries.

&gt;Neither am I going to counter it with benefits of Union because I have argued with you people before and I have long since learnt no amount of facts or figures changes your mind.

Please, do try. I've only been able to come up great trade links with England and a wide web of embassies; neither of which are irrevocable if withdrawn.

&gt;No sane business, immigrant or investment can consider Scotland without some level of assurance of stability or access to whatever it needs.

Not strictly true in all cases, much development is taking place in Scotland, usually being driven by the Scottish government itself. Dundee waterfront, for example.

&gt;Changing its operational relationship and framework from within the confines of Union would lead to a much stabler, beneficial and productive result.

Yes, it would. This is what was proposed with Devo Max, which was shot down by Westminster. This is why reform is so unlikely, it challenges Westminster's power and the City's money supply.

Personally, I feel a move to federalisation is the only fair way Scotland could remain in the UK.

It's not that 30% of Scots want to leave the Union, it's that 30% of Scots think the Union is beyond saving.",0,1385914065,null,0,1385914357,0,cdqyk3l,t3_1ru5vp,t1_cdqyk3l,t1_cdqyaeh,null,1428440565,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

The oddity is that the most left wing parties support it so heavily, yet allowing vast amounts of unskilled labour will depress the market.  But yet our highly skilled VISA program has changed so much lately its almost impossible.

When you are a company which has a highly educated person in the St. Petersburg office who wants to relocate to London, but can't.  That is stupid.  This one example is a £100k per year wage.  It isn't going to be filled by someone who doesn't have Phd+ level education.

That is stupid.

Meanwhile, look how easy it is to hire a eastern european cleaner in London that you are paying only minimum wage (rather than London living wage).

We've a fucked up with our immigration.  If I say so in the dinner party circle, people choke on their chardonnay whilst going to fetch a Guardian to beat me with.

true,junnies,null,null,"BR really messed up with his selections in this game. He assumed Hull City were pushovers and played Sterling and Moses, two players who've looked mediocre at best this season, and often very poor. It wasn't simply that they couldn't hold on to the ball or add to our attack attack, they frequently lost the physical and mental battle and made us defensively vulnerable. We were playing with 9 men right from the start and it showed.

I can't fault the rest of the team for effort. To break down ten men behind the ball, you need every single player to be able to hold on to the ball so that the entire team can gradually move up the field, something Sterling/Moses repeatedly messed up for us. We looked really poor, but i put the blame squarely on those two.

We've no depth so we absolutely have to go for the win every game with our best players. That means Coutinho, Allen, and maybe even Aspas and Alberto, players who've performed decently or haven't really been given the chance to shine. Not players who've been given many chances and failed to shine in any of them (ergo Sterling/Moses)

Liverpool have maybe four top-class players in Mignolet, Skrtel (this season), Sturridge and Suarez. The rest are either above average or mediocre. We CAN'T afford to step the foot off the pedal. We NEED to go all out for the win for every game if we want any chance of reaching top 4. Even Suarez has his off-days like today, and we cannot afford to simply rely on him. BR seems to have become over-complacent with his team selection today.

No it doesn't. You may have inferred that, but there are plenty of time agents around.

&gt;This is further confirmed in the 50th anniversary special that they come out and say that Capt. Jack is dead.

*No they don't*. They got the manipulator on the occasion of **one** of his deaths. He dies repeatedly.

&gt;We backtrack and find out that Jack is the ""Face of Bo**e**"", due to a nickname he picked up as a child.

We find out he had the same nickname; he is never confirmed as the same person.

&gt;The Face of Bo**e** dying is a fixed point and cannot be changed.

Says whom?

&gt;So how is this possible? Well I think that that Jack faked his death in order to join Torch Wood.

No he didn't.

This level of forward is never going to do that and all we do is let them control the ball and lay it off while we run back to our own box to try to block the inevitable shot or cross.

In the first couple of games Toure BOSSED the opposition strikers, at the point they we receiving the ball he was on them, usually resulting in them being unable to control it and us getting the ball back. Now he's backing off, backing off with the rest of them.

Meanwhile Brendan critcised one of our defenders (sakho) after araenal for pressing the ball in the lead up to their first goal (while everyone else scurried back to the six yard box). Since then he hasn't played, despite overall being our best defender that day.

At the same time, brendan has heaped praise on skrtel. And he is good at the last ditch stuff, clearances from the six yard box, blocks. But he never looks to step up and win the ball early.

If our tactical plan is to back off that much i don't think its going to work.

**Moses**: He directly caused the first Hull goal. He missed an excellent chance that really should've been put away. In general, I'm really just not impressed with him. He looks like he's just phoning it in, counting down the days until he can go back to Chelsea.

**Skrtel**: He scored on us *twice*. He should not play vs. Norwich. I'm sure people will jump down my throat for this, and the first goal wasn't really his fault, but the second OG *absolutely* was. I don't care how good the *rest* of his game was; that's completely irrelevant. If you're scoring goals on your own team, you should not be on the pitch. I know they were both deflections, but the second one was an avoidable deflection of a shot that was going wide. 

Sterling looked out of his league, Alberto was typically invisible, and frankly I'm not sold on Toure either. Far as I'm concerned the starting CBs should be Agger and Sakho from now on. 

That said, this loss wasn't Skrtel or Moses's fault; it took a real effort for *the entire team* to put in such a shitty, half-assed performance. I'm going to stop typing now because this game is fucking painful just to think about.

2.  The software industry is definitely concentrated in South East England, so maybe the unemployed are less willing to travel?

3.  Perhaps there's a more fundamental flaw, how do they know who's working or not?  Do they include contractors?  Was their definition of 'work' to narrow, or 'Computer Science' too broad?

Big guess here, but every pregnant lady I've worked with has been allowed to go to term unless they pose a risk to the child in utero (threats of self harm, trauma etc.), and then the baby is taken before they see it. If she made threats, there would be a large discussion within the MDT including social workers, psychiatrists, nurses etc. Following this the hospital managers would be informed, and the legal representatives of the trust in the hospital she is detained. They would put their case forward, and the grounds for an unconsented c-section. This goes to a judge who makes the decision. If they felt it could wait until term, they would. So would the medical team performing the c-section as they can refuse a case, and if there is a legal ambiguity, will not touch it with a large stick. 

Basically, this isn't a ""social worker"" taking someones baby. Dozens of varying professions would have to come to an agreement that this was in the child's best interests and saving it from future harm/neglect.

And Lucas, as much as I love him defensively, hardly ever does anything for the attack. Our fullbacks are pretty weak too. Johnson has been fairly poor and ineffective so far this year. Enrique is decent, though inconsistent. Flanagan is performing well, lucky for us, but he's young and needs experience before we can realistically rely on him.

true,igloo_assassin,num7,,"I really agree with your observation about Arsenal. They set up triangles and give each other options readily which makes them difficult to defend. Though we hold possession well, I think it is wasted, safe possession (like many of our shots, unfortunately). I've always loved Lennon because he keeps defenders on their heels and makes good runs off the ball. 

One thing I also think something we need more of is early crossing. We almost scored from Walker to Townsend today, and it's one thing Bale did really well (look at his assist to Benzema this weekend) that we desperately miss. It catches defenders out of position and would help involve Soldado more since he makes dangerous runs. Though I feel we dropped 2 points we really could've had today, I'm encouraged by the effort.

I'd like to see more conviction when attacking the box to get on the end of crosses but we are definitely going in the right direction if we can build on this performance and as I said in a post the other day: give me the 'score 4, concede 4' Spurs over the 'solid defence + lucky penalty' Spurs any day.

Have you actually read the white paper where it discusses the splitting up of the assets? Scotland would not be asking for 10% of the UK's assets in Scotland - it would be asking for 10% of the UK's assets in their entirety. 

EU states with secessionist (I will not countenance the term ""separatist"" - it is in no way reflective of most secessionist movements in EFA) movements may have a consideration for setting precedent. That's true. But a few things about that. Let's use Spain as an example. Yes, they will be thinking of Catelonia. But are the two comparable for precedent setting? No. Why? Because of the Edinburgh agreement. The UK Government is giving its consent to this, and will respect the outcome. The same is not true of Spain. They're not comparable, legally. Also, although Catelonia will be on the mind of the Spanish, so will other things. The damage to the reputation of the EU if a country leaves, the damage to their fishing fleet when they can't access the North Sea. It's not so black and white to say ""Spain won't like it"" - realpolitik has to come into play. 

The SNP do not have answers to my questions, because that's not the avenue they're pursuing. That's silly. It would be a mess. No one wants that (neither Scotland nor the UK), so why would anyone look into it? Silly. The white paper clearly states that the 18months of discussions are to ensure that there is no time outwith both the UK and the EU. On independence day, we leave the UK and join the EU together.

You have to remember, politicians in Westminster are elected by the people of the UK - and those are the people they have to answer to and keep happy if they want to get voted in again... so if Scotland leaves the UK, the politicians in Westminster will have the remaining people of the UK to favour. Why would they pass development money and jobs on to Scotland if they could benefit the English, Irish and Welsh constituents that will vote for them. It's not a case of ""fucking over"" the Scottish as you acknowledge - just the reality of the situation.

I've always said - and **it is** scaremongering, the Scots are far better off being in a union with a friend, than having a hostile nation share a land border. Not to denigrate the Scots at all, but history hasn't favored their rivalry with the English and with the rUK now 9 times larger than Scotland it's something to be nervous about. Not in a ridiculous ""We're going to invade you"" sense, but purely economic and cultural rivalry. Far from delimiting Scottish culture, I could actually see independence constraining it - since Westminster won't have to care about the effects of legislation north of the border.

If you want a real life example just look at HS2. It's probably fair to say a Scottish connection to the service would be getting more serious thought if it weren't for the prospect of independence.

Whether or not there was sufficient evidence gathered to secure a conviction does not mean the charges were baseless or ridiculous. There was good reason to suspect him, and as a self appointed leader of a group actively causing unrest and damages, seeking a prosecution was in the public interest.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"Farage himself has said the 2009-2010 manifesto for the last general election was Horlicks but you have to consider how far they've come as a party in terms of size, resources, and funding since when they would have first started writing it.  The new manifesto for 2014-2015 is due out, well, *now*, so it's difficult to say how their manifesto reflects the recent changes.

As for actively seeking to clean up and modernise their image for the first time their candidates are now undergoing psych tests which no other party does.  The first time these were implemented were for the 2014 MEP nominees announced in September and MP candidates they've now started naming.  It did actually cause a rift with some of the old guard members such as Mike Nattrass who didn't pass muster.  There's been some resentment among Scottish candidates too with fellow Scot David Coburn being effectively airlifted in from his London solicitor's practice into the number one spot.  UKIP's not made any excuses for it, that these are the eggs that need to be broken to make the omelette even if it puts a coupe of noses out of joint.

Their MEP nominee list for 2014 is frankly top drawer for any party, and has a completely different look and feel to it as a party.  If one looks at the top placed candidates per region they're encouragingly strong.  Some regions they're even looking at getting 3 or 4 MEPs, and the caliber doesn't appear to drop off.  Gawain Towler, Diane James, Steve Woolfe, and Tim Aker are all reasonable possibilities in their respective three spots.

The big outsourcing companies with training and a career structure can afford to take on graduates, and many do. But smaller businesses can't afford to employ people who consume more resources than they deliver.

Overall environmental benefits are practically nil once one calculates that they still require secondary sources of generation running inefficiently ready to step it up when the wind stops blowing, or, heaven forbid, blows too much.  They put energy prices up, make gas less affordable because there's an EU ruling that gives renewable energy primacy which means the most profitable aspects of gas fuelled electricity generation, the peak spots and surges, are eaten into by subsidised projects, which means the gas you're still dependent on is more expensive.

Higher energy prices are successful in externalising Europe's emissions.  Europe pats itself on the back for myopically cleaning their immediate environment but all they've really done is sent the emissions and the manufacturing to another side of the planet.

And for what?  If the sun decides to go into another warm cycle all the temperature increase and climate hysteria will still happen.

It's a semi-stealthy way of [collecting a

It also somewhat mitigates the effect of cartels, since the damage
from price-fixing is eroded by prices generally rising.  That might be
why deflation is regarded with official horror.  The onset of
deflation would mean that governments would actually have to do
something about cartels, or accept conditions like the 'thirties
(which we're not far off anyway).

In periods when we had a fully functioning economy, deflation wasn't a
problem; prices fell during the 19th century, an era of enormous
economic growth that we cannot achieve now.  We would be better off
with sound money and governments that actually did their job, but that
isn't on offer and isn't going to be.

true,Mantonization,eng-dorset,Dorrrrrset,"&gt;Anti the European Court of Human Rights encroaching on protections that should be afforded to every UK citizen! They're not doing it because they want less rights but MORE! As in we won't allow you to be deported unless we see the evidence first and you get to address it in this country. Innocent UK people have spent months upon months in foreign rotting jail cells without being charged!

I'm not sure what you're saying here. Are you saying that you're against the ECHR is bad because it takes away the rights of British people?

Because if so, you **literally** have it backwards. The ECHR gives British people explicit rights that we didn't have before. 

If I may quote [Yarg](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1k239g/cameron_we_need_to_look_at_scrapping_the_human/cbkmj03) for a moment:

&gt;The European Convention of Human Rights is so named because it sets down a series of minimal requirements that European states have agreed to be necessary for a fair and democratic society. Each of the specific rights it sets down is extremely reasonable and difficult to dispute.

&gt;Here are some of the rights infringements that the ECHR has prevented in the UK:-

&gt; * Requiring that when somebody is killed by the state there must be a proper independent investigation, and that armed personnel should be trained properly (McCann et al v UK)
&gt; * Preventing the government informing paramilitaries they know will kill someone of that individual's location, to execute by proxy (Shaghan v UK)
&gt; * You can't put an ethnic individual in a cell with a racist offender and take bets on how long he'll last (he died) (R on the application of Amin v SSHD)
&gt; * It led to safeguards and legal standards for wiretapping (Malone v UK) (Although it would appear not nearly enough...)
&gt; * You can't ""interrogate"" prisoners by forcing them into certain positions or depriving them of light and sound (Ireland v UK)
&gt; * The legalisation of homosexuality in Northern Ireland (Dudgeon v UK)
&gt; * Stopping contempt of court from infringing on freedom of the press (Sunday Times v UK)
&gt; * The mentally ill who voluntarily commit themselves to an institution are owed the same duty - suicide watch etc - as those who are sectioned (Rabone v Pennine Care)
&gt; * Ensuring that existing prisoners still get access to solicitors (Golder v UK)
&gt; * Ensuring that workers maintain rights to join trade unions (Wilson v UK)
&gt; * Giving the police an obligation to act if somebody is being dangerously stalked (Osman v UK)
&gt; * Preventing indefinite detention under the declaration of a national emergency (A v SOS for the Home Dept).
&gt; * Preventing public birching of children by the police in the Isle of Man (Tyrer v UK)
&gt; * If you're arrested and acquitted, the government cannot arbitrarily hold onto your DNA, which could never have been obtained were you not wrongly accused (S &amp; Marper vs UK)

&gt;The crucial thing to bear in mind here is that in every single instance the government claimed their behaviour was justified and defended its illegality. If we merely had a domestic Bill of Rights, there would be no external check to prevent it being modified whenever it inconveniences the government.  

&gt;As for the two main 'case studies' against the ECHR:-

&gt;1. The prisoner voting right has been hugely overblown by politicians. The ECHR simply requires proportionality, and no blanket policies - that is, there must be a possibility of certain prisoners voting (e.g. if you're in prison for 2 weeks on a petty offence, you shouldn't be denied the right to vote).

&gt;2. The Abu Qatada issue is incredibly sketchy. It only became an issue because the government was unable to scrape together enough evidence to convict him under our very broad limitations to freedom of speech, even though he would seem to fall within them. [It's been speculated that this is because evidence was ubtained under torture](www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/i-represented-abu-hamza-in-his-extradition-proceedings-why-is-he-being-tried-in-america-8205879.html). It is not so unreasonable that somebody who has not been convicted of any crime can't just be deported to a regime known to use torture - imagine how easy such a power would be to abuse.

&gt;It's also worth remembering that the ECHR is totally separate from the EU and the ECJ, which are the bodies which impose economic requirements like fishing quotas.

true,G_Morgan,cnty-wales,Wales,"The education, from a programming perspective, is rubbish. The ones that do well are the people who went in able to program to a decent degree. The ones who start furrowing their eyebrows in confusion when a lecturer starts talking about what OOP is. This is a problem the world over but outside Europe corporate culture is better able to face the risks. America has companies who'll take on the mess of badly miseducated graduates and try to straighten stuff out.

There are two separate groups who both suffer from the intolerably shit programming education. Firstly there are the effective vocational degree courses. Ignoring for the moment that the entire principle of a vocational degree in software engineering is wrong headed, the fact that the parts they teach are also the parts that are universally taught badly is damaging to them.

The second group is the pure CS group. These tell you that they don't have time to teach programming. It is a lie. There are more hours teaching programming on every Russell group CS course than there are for any other topic. The real issue in proper CS departments is that programming education is boring. Half the lecturers haven't actually seen a real program to know why it is wrong (even though there are nice mathematical principles behind some OOP stuff they still screw up). Nobody wants to dedicate the energy to fixing what everyone else is getting wrong anyway.

The problem is what they teach on those courses is misleading. To the point where after they graduate students need to take a few years deprogramming what they learned in university.

For instance it takes years to deprogram students from the horrendous focus on inheritance. Not helped by the misleading ""is a""/""has a"" dichotomy and the focus on ""objects map real life objects"" assertion. The latter statement is a straight out lie and the former classification is misleading and doesn't remotely capture the distinction between subclassing and composition cases. Today you'll still get students who'll tell you that ""Square extends Rectangle"" is perfectly fine because ""a square is a rectangle"".

true,Skywolf111,null,null,"I disagree, at least I don't think it should. Working in the film industry you start to watch movies in a different way. My girlfriend calls it ""movie eyes"" but really its about looking at the details of the how the film is crafted. Often I'll be watching a show or movie and I'll say something along the lines, ""That's really cool! They did that by _____"" and if I'm watching something with someone who doesn't know me very well they will say something like, ""Can't you just enjoy the film!"".

Movie magic, isn't magic. It takes a large group of people all working together for a common goal. It's a collaborative art form that is amazing but often gets overlooked as art because of it's commercialization. Seeing behind the scenes photos like this give you a look at the brush strokes. In this photo you get to see the raw performance of the actors in their wonderful costumes, you get to understand how difficult it is that they aren't staring down the face of some formidable foe, but are instead in a monotone room looking down a camera lens. not only that but there is probably at least ten people directly behind the camera smiling and watching them. Matt Smith and Tennant have filled the doctor shoes for years and they really know how to create a performance in this kind of setting. 

What you are seeing here is the real magic, you see the people coming together to make something special. Someone crafted each of their costumes, someone else styled each of their hair, someone else created their sonic screwdrivers, someone else put lights up so that they look more dramatic, someone else placed the camera where it needed to be, someone else coached them into their positions, someone else created the green screen room, someone else wrote the words they speak, another person will animate the scenery around them, another person will edit the film together, another person will write the music that accompanies them, others will perform it, there is even countless other jobs from the clapperboard, to people yelling ""Quiet on Set!"" to the caterer making sure that the cast and crew are fed well because they are bound to work for sixteen hours that day. That's the real Magic, and all of those people working together create the wonderful polished product that we get to enjoy. 

TLDR: In my opinion The real magical thing about movies is the collaborative effort that goes into making them, and behind the scene photos give the audience the chance to see it.

EDIT: I don't usually talk through movies unless with the right people, that is extremely rude. Most of my conversations happen after the movie is over or while it is paused.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"I disagree on the point that being in the EU would make up for the competitiveness (and the size/geographical/infrastructural etc.) advantages that the rUK would have. If anything, being in the EU could constrain the competitiveness of Scotland - as EU red tape will make it far harder for an independent Scotland to aggressively undercut the rUK in important markets. This is even more true at the moment as the EU is pushing for greater economic cohesion particularly amongst smaller higher-risk member states (Greece, Ireland and Portugal being prime examples). 

I do agree with you that both nations would get by - but my point being that I think the Scots might actually find they emerge from independence feeling somewhat bruised and asset stripped by hard-line negotiations over the settlement, and the comparatively weak nature of their own bargaining position. Then on-top of that, far from being economically 'set free' they suddenly find key industries under economic assault from south of the border as companies rush to snap up contracts and business that normally would have gone north. In the long term the Scots may be able to re-orientate their economy to exploit that difference, but at the outset the Scots will not have the capability in many key industries to exploit the full economic advantages that independence could allow. I think the time frame for that would be more like &gt;30-50+ years down the road as a minimum.

Here's one very small example - the call centers for a lot of English country councils are actually outsourced to Scotland... but its likely that post-independence people wouldn't accept government functions being outsourced to companies operating under the legislation of a foreign power. So there will be a move to get services like that back into the rUK. The UK has massive capacity to take semi-skilled office jobs like that back overnight. In contrast, for Scotland to build up a world leading shipbuilding industry, or become a global financial center is going to take decades of focused investment and competitive planning.

So the main point is that although there may be long term economic benefits for the Scots, the assumption in voters minds (as I see it) should be that independence could, and in all likelihood will, bring with it a period of economic hardship in the short term. Precisely how severe that could be is debatable - my gut instinct is it wouldn't be drastic, but that average Scots would feel the pinch - from increased redundancies and unemployment to reduced state services.",0,1385921996,null,0,1385922262,0,cdr1gzg,t3_1ru5vp,t1_cdr1gzg,t1_cdqzx15,null,1428439206,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Anyways, Sad about the result, obviously, would have liked us to get a second in the first half, think we'd have been able to stand a bit more pressure that way. Slightly concerned perhaps by the change in tactics that suddenly made us seem so pressured, all it took was 2 strikers and a long ball system.

Osvaldo once again didn't add anything special, or even interesting. Wanyama was caught in possession far too much, it's worrying to see him just reacting so slowly when he has the ball, or letting it roll past him assuming he's got an acre of space. Don't blame Gazzaniga for anything, especially since he was thrown in at the deep end, not much more to say on that.


Arsenal and Chelsea away, one after the other, is not easy for any team, and no team is ever going to be expected to win either really, so the fact that we lost doesn't overly bother me, especially as it took a fuck up and a penalty in the Arsenal game, and two corners (which although annoying to conceed from, were some of the only chances Chelsea had for a long time) to get us beaten, so I'll take heart from going toe-to-toe with both, and then when we will go beat Villa midweek to remind everyone we're still around.

The media will paint it as a petulant outburst from AVB against the media and unfortunately most people will probably never read through the transcript. The only story they will get is that AVB had an exchange with a reporter that will almost certainly end up being painted as ""AVB feeling the pressure of the sack""  by multiple members of the media.

You are right about Ashton not having a regard for what they write and the effect it has on people.  Guys like Ashton, Martin Samuel etc are concerned with getting people to read their articles either by picking up the paper or reading it online.  Its a business choice, more clicks, more readers, more appearances on the tele or radio means more attention and that they will still have jobs where they are well compensated.  

Unfortunately for AVB this is the type of thing that plays directly into the media's hands as it is another manufactured controversy that can endlessly be manipulated by the media to get attention, and in no way will this type of situation be  beneficial to AVB or the Spurs. 

There will still be stories of how AVB is facing the sack, how he is doing any number of things that ""people"" don't agree with, how he is not dealing with media scrutiny well. Now of course he has opened the door to be the focus in the media for a little bit longer.

As for who I mean. 

Suarez is amazing, but he's almost certainly leaving over the summer.

We have no competent wingers. We brought Moses in for it but clearly he's not performing as expected. Sterling is far too young and needs a loan. I don't think he'll achieve what he's capable of if we only let him play a game every couple of months, and he's not good enough as a starter right now.

Henderson I do not rate, sorry. He's a workhorse but does not produce and I think that's detrimental to the team. Pressing is important, I agree, but contributing to the attack is as well, which Henderson is lacking at.

Gerrard is unfortunately declining and has not done well this year. I don't think he's title winning good anymore. He's got a decent long pass still, but his short passes are typically poor, and he doesn't get forward as much as he used to.

Lucas is typically good defensively, but he has his poor games. He also rarely helps the attack which I think is detrimental.

Johnson has not been good this year, and wasn't great last year. He's put in some okay defensive performances every now and then, but has almost no contribution to the attack. He's technically skilled, but most of the time his contributions lead to a turnover.

Suarez, Sturridge, Mignolet have all done well. Our CBs have done well for the most part. Coutinho is talented but still young and fairly weak. He hasn't performed especially well this year, but I think part of that is not having anyone to really pass it to besides Sturridge / Suarez, who are both heavily covered.

What's the story behind this? Thanks in advance.

There are only two subreddits related to Arsenal with over a thousand subscribers: /r/Gunners and /r/Gooners. If you actually looked into the purpose of each subreddit, only /r/Gooners and /r/Arsenal are ""hipster"" subreddits and /r/Arsenal is incredibly small. /r/GunnersatGames is for people to discuss ticket sales and all that because too much of that content was cluttering the main subreddit (which is effectively not Arsenal related but Fan related). /r/TrueGunners was meant to be an alternative subreddit for discussion but is dead, and /r/ArsenalFC was made when /r/Gunners broke down. /r/Gunnersjerk doesn't even exist.

At the very least it means a candidate has to be able to run a campaign and win a competition.  It might be a test of Machiavellian skills, but it is still a test.  That and I really like the idea of small set constituencies directly responsible to a close by electorate.  You run a campaign, you get most votes, you win a seat.  It's also a test of the party.  One or two MPs might be a possibility but the party really needs to firing on cylinders to be a contender.  It may take a lot longer but in theory it should be a lot stronger for it.  In the interim it's not like they're not achieving things; UKIP has already moved from being a protest party to a very successful pressure party.  Let's face it, they're always in the news, they're always in the press, they're running regular articles, and now the main parties are more than aware that they need to address issues that they raise.  Even the difference in MEP candidates between 2009 and 2014 shows how a new party evolves over time, and they need this time to evolve before getting real power.

I really don't like Alternate Voting where measily compromises are made.  Generally there can often be more than one solution to a problem and a strong opinion more often than not will be polarising. The idea of scrapping or rating a vote best to worst, or sending a ballot back in to be counted for a second preference doesn't rest well with me.  It's more an 'anything but' vote, and that's not a good way to come to any solution, with people of the least popular opinion getting to plump a second time.   

...*then again the actual form of AV they proposed historically would have changed very little.*

Like I say, I can see merits behind both PR and FPTP, and I can see flaws inherent in both, which is why I finally reconciled around a FPTP-PR hybrid.

The idea that I would support PR simply because it would have handed more power to UKIP sooner didn't sit well.  It would have been hypocritical supporting it simply because a party I supported would have done better out of it.

I don't think [MIRV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_independently_targetable_reentry_vehicle)s existed in 1972, but they certainly would have used multiple missiles and aircraft to achieve a similar effect over somewhere as important as London.

Plotting the London attack as a single 30MT warhead is a huge oversimplification. As I touched on above, it would probably have many smaller kT-MT range weapons both sent on 1972-era rockets for rough population-centre strikes and to eliminate the RAF as far as possible, then bombs with greater precision dropped on specific areas by air crews. 

It's also **assuming that only the USSR are targeting us.** In total war like this - the failure of mutually-assured destruction - who can say what other nuclear powers would do?

- **China**, as a fellow communist state, was originally assured by the Soviets that it was protected by their 'nuclear umbrella'. The [Sino-Soviet split](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Soviet_split) put paid to that as far back as 1959, and [by 1964 they were testing their own bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction#History) - primarily to protect themselves from the USSR.  
It's widely acknowledged that in this WW3 scenario, China and the Soviets would also attack each other. But what about China/the West? It might be that neither side was willing to leave it to chance. With the kill-or-be-killed ethos of trading nuclear strikes, the idea that ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"" goes out the window. So they might take a pop at Britain in 1972.
- [**India**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction), [**Pakistan**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction), and [**South Africa**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction#Testing_the_first_device) did not have nuclear weapons in 1972 - although development was underway. In any case I'd love to know who they might attack in an uncontrolled total war situation - I can't imagine it's NATO, but who?
- [**North Korea**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction#History) was allegedly working on weapons as far back as this, although they didn't actually test one until 2006. They *still* don't have anything capable of delivering the bomb in 2013 - so they're out for sure.
- **France** and **the US** are obviously our best friends... leaving just
- [**Israel**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapons_and_Israel). Bit of a weird one, the only state that has nuclear arms but refuses to acknowledge it officially. Estimates are that they have had 'operational capability' to attack other states since circa 1967, making them **valid players in this scenario.**
  
  This is where it gets really wild. [The Samson Option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Option) is an established theory about how a small, threatened state like Israel might use its nuclear weapons 'everywhere and anywhere' as an extreme deterrent against attack. In short - they might **target both the USSR and NATO capitals to provoke an extreme response**, to try and ensure that *nobody* even thinks of messing with them without destroying the world as we know it:

  &gt;In the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Arab forces were overwhelming Israeli forces and Prime Minister Golda Meir authorized a nuclear alert and ordered 13 atomic bombs be readied for use by missiles and aircraft. The Israeli Ambassador warned President Nixon of “very serious conclusions"" if the United States did not airlift supplies. Nixon complied. This is seen by some commentators on the subject as the first threat of the use of the Samson Option.[19][20][21][22][23]

  &gt;&gt;*""What would serve the Jew-hating world better in repayment for thousands of years of massacres but a Nuclear Winter. Or* ***invite all those tut-tutting European statesmen and peace activists to join us in the ovens?*** *For the first time in history, a people facing extermination while the world either cackles or looks away—unlike the Armenians, Tibetans, World War II European Jews or Rwandans—have the power to destroy the world. The ultimate justice?*""

  &gt;&gt;[Perlmutter, David (April 7, 2002), ""Israel: Dark Thoughts and Quiet Desperation"", The Los Angeles Times (opinion piece)]

  But wait, there's more!
  &gt;Van Creveld was quoted in David Hirst's The Gun and the Olive Branch (2003) as saying:

   &gt;&gt;*We possess several hundred atomic warheads and rockets and can launch them at targets in all directions,* ***perhaps even at Rome. Most European capitals are targets for our air force.*** *Let me quote General Moshe Dayan:* ***'Israel must be like a mad dog, too dangerous to bother.'*** *I consider it all hopeless at this point. We shall have to try to prevent things from coming to that, if at all possible. Our armed forces, however, are not the thirtieth strongest in the world, but rather the second or third.* ***We have the capability to take the world down with us. And I can assure you that that will happen before Israel goes under.****[30]*

  &gt;Ron Rosenbaum writes in his 2012 book *How the End Begins: The Road to a Nuclear World War III* that in the ""aftermath of a second Holocaust"", Israel's surviving Dolphin-class nuclear missile submarines would **retaliate not only against Israel's attackers, but ""bring down the pillars of the world (attack Moscow and European capitals for instance)""** as well as the ""holy places of Islam."" He writes that **""abandonment of proportionality is the essence"" of the Samson Option.**[31]

I understand the extreme-MAD logic of the Samson Option, but if a country traditionally considered an ""ally"" is indeed targeting NATO, surely NATO is targeting them back?  
This applies to the present day as well. I'd love to know more about it, it's strange and fascinating.

Incidentally the Bow Group has speculated that UKIP may overtake the Conservatives in terms of membership around 2018, and they've already taken quite a few of their donors, so they really are path-finding a way to form a meaningful alternative to the 3 party system.  The more parties the easier for other parties to break through into the mainstream.

It's a good thing.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Wtf is that supposed to mean? Gay people got gay marriage. Poor oppressed 'minority' Christians amirite? Frankly, I think he's a bigot. Nothing he said was worthy.

Gay marriage was a big change to a long standing religious institution. It flew in the face of hard-won civil partnership rights. And was born out of the hyperbole whereby those who didn't instantly champion ""gay marriage"" was labelled a ""vile homophobe"". It was a sad moment in UK political history when, out of nowhere, an extremist minority got their way through nefarious means.

Was gay marriage mentioned in the Queen's speech setting out the political agenda for the year? No. Even in spite of the fact it was rushed through parliament and labelled a historically important piece of legislation.

Was gay marriage mentioned in the Conservative manifesto at the last election? No.

That gay marriage was *such a priority* - above and beyond all other issues including housing, benefits, and immigration - while being hidden from the voting public (incidently in Australia, where voting is *compulsory*, the party standing on a platform of gay marriage was resoundly beaten in a historically significantly huge loss - the only country to let its people have a say on the issue).

No matter what your stance on gay marriage is - even if you support it - you must weep at the breakdown in the political process to bring such significant social change without any consultation of the public. If you support gay marriage now you will be pleased - but will you bitch if the government rushes through legislation in the future that you have no say on?",0,1385927455,null,0,false,0,cdr3usu,t3_1ru1rh,t1_cdr3usu,t1_cdr2sp4,null,1428438094,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

Actual climate scientists downplaying politicians fuelling hysteria.

And since even the EU commissioner for Industry is saying that they're facing an economic 'massacre' because of the push for renewables driving  up energy costs then there seems to be more pressing matters.

It's strange that when you actually listen to industry and scientists, and not politicians interpreting science and lobbyists, then the climate hysteria around climate change (which is a real thing) takes on a different hue and comes across as just that - hysteria.

RICHARD LINDZEN, who actually helped form the climate change model in the 1990s has pointed out that it has turned into alarmism.  He's the actual guy whose work people are jumping on and championing.  He's all for saving billions and if it becomes a problem in 50 years dealing with it then!

- And even if you still think something needs to be done now, understand that it's hamstringing the economy and if that happens you won't be able to do anything, and understand what is being done isn't working.

true,mbdjd,null,null,"I just finished a degree in Web App Development and I am only speaking from my experience here but I think the teaching of programming was actually not *that* bad or at least not the biggest issue, the major problem was that it was such a minor part of the course. Let's say we had 6 modules, we only ever had one which was a coding module and then usually a second one which partially involved programming. In my final term I had an entire module about internet psychology and literally only one module that involved programming at all and even for that code was worth less than half the module.

The result of this is that there simply wasn't enough time to devote to teaching it properly and students who just did not understand programming at all were able to barely scrape by the module with a ton of help from friends and go on to get good grades overall. I knew at least 5 people on my course that, by the end of second year, simply did not understand OOP at all. Inheritance wasn't even something they could have misinterpreted because they just flat out did not have the knowledge required to get to inheritance.  

You're probably thinking that a Web Dev course probably focuses on other facets aside from programming but it really, really didn't. The course was completely filled with bloat, like a module every year about the ""legal"" side of IT which was not only incredibly dull but I can guarantee that it will never be of any help to me whatsoever. 

I think the major issue I had with the actual teaching of programming was completely failing to explain the bigger picture, as you mentioned, we learned that you had a Vehicle Class and a Car Class would inherit from Vehicle because a car was a type of vehicle. Sure, everyone understood that but they don't explain why the hell this would ever be useful. They taught us what objects were but they didn't teach us OOP. As you say, the whole concept of explaining classes/objects by using real life examples is absolutely fine for the very first introduction to it, but it was never properly conveyed how OOP is used in the bigger picture.

Oscar in my eyes is not a true playmaker, and I could list and compare the two for hours, but again, it would be pointless if you are unable to see the differences between the two offensively (and you have the right to stick to your opinion).

           Suárez  Sturridge

       Coutinho          AM
                   Gerrard
           Lucas

    LB        CB        CB        RB

Now through every position:

**Forward:** Suárez is our best player, and maybe even the best striker in the league. He does not get injured a lot. Sturridge on the other hand is injured. I think Aspas is good enough as a back-up striker. Because Sturridge is injured, I predict some game time for him, in which we'll find out if he can be a quality striker.

**Attacking midfield:** Coutinho is good, but he's just 21 years old and needs more experience. He is not yet good enough to win us the league, but it will come over time. But I believe we need another attacking midfielder. Someone who is fast, and whose main task is going forward.

**Central/Defending midfield:** Here's our biggest problem. I have to say, with pain in my heart, Gerrard may not be the person wo will win us the league. His long passes are great, his set pieces are great, his short passes aren't and his stamina isn't. He should be person connecting the defence with the attacking midfield. The problems usually start at the 60' mark. Gerrard and Lucas tire. Before the 60' mark they can be quite effective, and should be played. After sixty minutes, I believe a substitue should come on. Henderson seems to be our main guy, he never stops running, but like Allen, he doesn't offer a lot going forward. We need another central midfielder.

**Central defence:** We have a lot of depth in the central back position. Brendan Rodgers now just needs to find the best CB partnership. Sakho also deserves more playing time.

**Full-backs:** Enrique is out; Johnson is inconsistent; Flanagan is playing well but is unproven; Kelly is (probably) out; Cissokho should not play in red again. Sakho can play as a left-back, but I don't know if he is effective there. So we need another full-back or two.

TL;DR: We need an attacking midfielder, a central midfielder, and a full-back.

true,G_Morgan,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt; I think the major issue I had with the actual teaching of programming was completely failing to explain the bigger picture, as you mentioned, we learned that you had a Vehicle Class and a Car Class would inherit from Vehicle because a car was a type of vehicle. Sure, everyone understood that but they don't explain why the hell this would ever be useful.

See this is precisely why I hate OOP education. This is a terrible way to teach somebody about inheritance. It implies that vague groupings form an inheritance hierarchy. In truth there isn't a set of properties you could attach to vehicle that could make it fit a logically sound supertype for all the relevant vehicles without being a null interface. People should be suspicious of it. There are very narrow circumstances in which it truly works and the way it is taught misleads students into believing otherwise. I believe that students shouldn't even be taught about inheritance until they've had a year of programming experience.

It also brings back the fallacy that OOP is somehow related to the real world. As part of my real life work I've done a fair bit of Java-&gt;native interop. If we ignore the existence of native bytebuffers for a moment you end up with objects like BoxedPointers, MemoryPools, Allocators and AutoReleasePools.

It's strange that when you aren't a biased and condescending twat trying to justify a stupid policy of a party you support, you realise that 90%+ of climate scientists agree that climate change is a real threat and is most likely caused by humans. You also realise that a shitty Youtube video with 2 or 3 scientists spouting nonsense isn't proof of anything.

Did you actually read that report? I doubt it. Because the Met Office is talking specifically about the 'pause'. One of their explanations for the 'pause' (in this, might I add, completely arbitrary period) is random variation, which looking at previous trends is actually completely expected. They literally say that this has happened before, but temperatures continue to rise in the long-term.

So how about you get out of your UKIP bubble, start listening to the scientific consensus instead of a few random individuals that confirm your bias, and stop misrepresenting data from organisations like the Met Office.

Don't give me BS about how people who were against gay marriage just supported the 'political process'. They didn't want gay people to have the same rights. Plain and simple.

&gt;It was a sad moment in UK political history when, out of nowhere, an extremist minority got their way through nefarious means.

By extremist minority do you mean gay people? Or perhaps you mean people who supported gay marriage? Polls consistently showed that 60%+ of the UK supported gay marriage. And if you think LGBT people are all extremists, then you really are a vile homophobe.

&gt;Was gay marriage mentioned in the Conservative manifesto at the last election? No.

So? The majority supported it, all 3 major political parties supported it and it was long overdue. No point waiting.

&gt;That gay marriage was such a priority - above and beyond all other issues including housing, benefits, and immigration

More than 1 bill can go through parliament at once. This was only made a massive issue because of people like you.


&gt;the party standing on a platform of gay marriage was resoundly beaten in a historically significantly huge loss

I don't know what point you're trying to make with this. 1. The views of the Australian population has nothing to do with Britain and 2. The Labor government was defeated for other reasons, not gay marriage. They were polling extremely badly long-before the gay marriage policy was announced.

&gt;you must weep at the breakdown in the political process to bring such significant social change without any consultation of the public

Nope because most people aren't even affected by it. The only people who are affected by it (gay people) supported it overwhelmingly. Polls showed that so did the majority of the general population. 

You can weep, but you're not weeping for the democratic process, you're weeping that a law you didn't support passed, and you're trying to justify it by other means because you don't have any good reasons against gay marriage.

I don't think Lucas is good enough for us to win the league with. Gerrard might be this year, but he won't be in a year or two's time. 

Aspas is not a good enough backup striker. Look at who the top teams have as back up strikers: Hernandez, Ba, Dzeko, ect.

Coutinho will be good enough in a few years, but not now. 

Enrique/Johnson on their day are some of the best in the league, so they can stay. But they're not getting any younger, we'll need replacements soon.

Agger/Skrtel/Sakho could win us the league, we just need to pick 2 and they need to find form. Mignolet is good enough. 

So basically, we have 3 and a half players in our current squad who could win us the league. 

1 player who will win us it in the next few years.

And 5 defenders who could potentially win us it, providing they hit for.



I agree about what we need though. Not sure about a fullback since Enrique is great, we just have no backup for him. Our midfield is our weakest point.

Stating he's three years younger means nothing. Oscar will become better at what he does, but will he become a different type of player? Highly unlikely, he'll be improving his current form, he has no logical reason to change what he does - He's world class at what he does.

You mention Mata and Valencia and his 3 years over Oscar, well, he was doing bang on the same at Valencia 4 years ago (even younger than Oscar, these are Primera División stats).

 - Valencia Stats 09: 11 Goals, 17 Assists
 - Chelsea Stats 13: 11 Goals, 17 Assists

Mata's career assists will always massively outnumber his goals, it's simply his style of play. Oscar on the other hand is a different player, his objectives on field are different, his style of play is different.

I doubt The Troubles have ever been mentioned on Chinese state media. The US consulate in Belfast issued warnings for their citizens last week following the failed bomb, we ""swept"" that under the carpet as well. 

Besides, I think you have a slightly warped image of the ""protests"" there. They were race riots, the nationalist Tibetans were beating up and killing immigrants. At no point was is a ""peaceful protest"". The EDL and Tibetan nationalists are shockingly similar, the more you dig the more parallels you see. Frankly I think it's disgusting that they receive so much support in the west purely because the group they are attacking is a ""rival"" of ours. 

Also, be aware that most stories we hear come from ""activists"" and are reported by Radio Free Asia (a US government station). They never mention dates, names or precise locations. Tibet is not as ""locked down"" as they'd want you to believe, people have camera phones and there is a constant migration of westerners into the region, you could sign up with a charity tomorrow and be out there within a couple of weeks if you wanted.

true,matcht,lfc12,,"Lucas Gerrard and Henderson is not a top four midfield. Gerrard is 33, he should not be an indisputable starter. 

Lucas is so limited, and his fitness is questionable. While it is always pointed out that he is important, that is only because he is the only defensive midfielder at the club. It is stupid that he has no competition or back up. Compare Sandro's performance today to Lucas's, disregarding the goal. He uses the ball much quicker, snaps into challenges and is generally more capable of covering the ground.

Henderson's work rate is only so important because of how poor Lucas and Gerrard's fitness is. As an advanced midfielder, you have to offer more than work rate (Kuyt, it was goals, Park Ji Sung, it was link up play). Henderson would not get into any of last season's top 5 sides. 

I seem to be the only one disappointed that we sold Downing, he was solid in his position. At least we came to be able to rely on him to produce 6/10 performances every week. He was important for our balance as he gave us width, used the ball well (something Moses and Sterling are god awful at). He made Johnson a better player. 

Our squad is very weak, but the defence should improve, because it can't get any worse than 6 goals conceded in 2 games. We are going to have to adapt again, since without Sturridge's pace and goal threat, teams can push up and press our defence and midfield. We are inexplicably bad at playing out from the back, if Swansea and Southampton can do it then we have no fucking excuse. 

We do need more senior players, and for those who think our first 11 cannot be improved then you are very wrong. Look at what signing experienced players did for Arsenal, Mertesacker Cazorla Koscielny Monreal Giroud Arteta Podolski were all over 25 when they signed. Add to that the players who have been there since they were young and now are coming of age, Ramsey Gibbs Sczeszcny Sagna. Now Arsenal are reaping the benefits, they no longer become fazed away from home when things are getting tough, they are far more consistent. You need a balance of youth and experience.

true,LongDongShagswell,null,null,"If I remember correctly, Demba Ba doesn't like playing with another striker.  When he paired up with Cisse last season, one of them, usually Cisse, had to play out wide.  Ba is a big, strong dude.  He's not the kind of guy that will place or chase a through ball from another striker. He needs service from out wide and opportunities to poach inside the box. 
The few times Torres played alongside Drogba, it was pitiful.  The two had no chemistry and fought for space on the field.  Torres favored being alone up front as well.

However, Torres is a different player now than he was when he hit his slump.  He works a lot harder and runs the channels more often. Other players can make runs when he drifts out of the center.  He's a lot faster and stronger than he was in the last few seasons.  Instead of only making space for himself, he makes space for runs from the midfield.  He didn't do this when Drogba was still with us, but he has become a much more complete forward since then.  He had to adapt because our midfield has been the focal point of our attacks.  

So, maybe a two-striker system is viable for us.  However, having two bodies instead of three in the central midfield roles poses some more issues.  Two central midfielders can absolutely be done, but it calls for players who can run a lot and play both offense and defense really well.  Ramires is the only first-team midfielder that I can see doing that.  Lampard and Essien could have done it five years ago, but their legs are too old now.  Without box to box midfielders to keep the team running, there will either be no link between the defense and offense or our defense will be exposed.  It's important that the central midfielders have endless gas tanks in a 4-4-2 or else there will be a deficiency in some part of play.

A diamond midfield (4-1-2-1-2 for you sticklers) is one alternative, but it is too predictable.  Everyone knows that Mikel won't go forward.

And a hell of a lot is not mentioned on UK state media, I happen to believe that the BBC's international coverage is disgraceful &amp; it is nothing but a front for the foreign office.

It's almost laughable with Gaddafi, their use of it stopped when we were arming him around 2002 then started immediately when we toppled him a few years back. 

Most of their issues are in selectively covering things. The Ukraine protests will see vastly more coverage than protests against worst governments we support e.g. Bahrain. 

&gt; I was talking about how we stayed silent about events in another country, yet the US consulate didn't stay silent. 

America has it's mitts very dirty in Tibet already. Their protests were political point scoring, not an action done because it was morally sound. 

&gt; Actually I never said they were peaceful protests. I even referred to them as riots.

Fair point.

* **Perception**. If GBP is perceived to be the stronger/safer currency, which at the outset it absolutely would, individual Scots would be more likely to keep their cash in it. Given the fluid nature of the border it would be almost impossible to stop savers doing this especially within the framework of the EU. The Scots could end up in an awkward position where individuals aren't actually using their currency.

* **Size**. The other issue is one of scale - a small currency backed by one of the smallest nations could only borrow to a fairly limited extent. Given that the Scots would almost certainly be debuting their currency in the red (from inherited share of national debt) they would be severely constrained by the financial markets in how much they can borrow... and they'll need to borrow competitively both to service their national debt AND to pay for the new services and infrastructure to kick-start their leftwing utopia. This isn't to say they couldn't - rather that it won't be very fun.

* **Markets**. The third problem is who would actually trade in this new currency. Edinburgh's financial services industry is miniscule in comparison to London and would take decades to build up - and they would effectively be duplicating that which already exists in London at huge expense. Even then they'd probably find the single biggest trader for their currency would actually be rUK financial markets... which would end up being a complicated arrangement.

**Ultimately;** Independence or not, Scottish currency or sterling, Scots will probably find that for the foreseeable future their economic policy will be coming out of the square mile, not out of Holyrood. Ironically, one way out of that would be to join the Euro... but Salmond knows the Euro is as toxic with the voters in Glasgow as it is in Greenwich.

XI: 4-2-3-1

Mignolet
Johnson Sakho Agger __LB_
Gerrard Lucas 
Suarez Coutinho __LW/CAM__
Sturridge

Bench: GK, CB (Skrtel?), Enrique, Hendo, Allen, LW/RW, ST

I know some people might raise eyebrows at the inclusion of Hendo and Allen, but I really do think they still have much to offer.

We need versatile attacking wide players/midfielders. Someone like Reus, El Sharaawy, De Bruyne (reaching for the stars, I know, but that kind of calibre). 

Enrique is a great LB but hasn't reached peak mental awareness. Physically and technically, he's immense. Mentality and awareness is what he lacks.

Sakho is new to us but has plenty of CL experience and has own titles. Something very few players in our squad have experience with.

Moses can NOT be given a start after his performance today. Coutinho can play on the left, and Alberto can play behind Suarez in the pocket. We don't need to push Hendo to LB because Rodger's formation has a defensive left-back while a more attacking-floating Right back. Also we need to try Sakho+Agger, in my opinion they will be the strongest two.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I've never used Cryptsy but it looks like its an exchange. My advice would be to create a wallet at https://blockchain.info/ then transfer your funds to it from Cryptsy then publish the public address of the wallet. 

The balance of every wallet is public so people can verify for themselves that you have the coins you claim to hold.

Next, blockchain.info will allow you to cryptographically sign a message using the private key of that wallet. By publishing the message and the signature here (never the private key!) people can confirm that you are indeed the holder of the wallet with those funds.  

(You can also do this with the bitcoinQT wallet if you have it installed. If you don't have it installed it will probably take over a day to sync the transactions from what I hear so blockchain.info will be faster.)

The next step is to find a way of tying this to your real world identity so that you have reputation to lose if the deal goes sour and to get your buyer to do the same. Perhaps post something you sign digitally on a website tied to you?

Finally, I'd suggest that both participants write and digitally sign a series of statements during the transaction. Provide bank details privately using email or IM but then carry out the exchange in as public a manner as possible with digitally signed confirmation steps, eg.

Buyer sends you £1 (nominal fee to confirm bank accounts are active and correct)
You confirm in a signed public statement that you received the money.
Buyer sends you half the remaining price.
You confirm in a signed public statement that you received the money.
You send the buyer the bitcoin.
Buyer confirms in a signed public statement that they received the money.
Buyer sends you the remaining money.
You confirm in a signed public statement that you received the money.

This minimises but does not eliminate the risk that one party will trick the other and reduces the amount at risk at each step.

Perhaps a simpler method would be to find someone with a trusted public reputation willing to act as escrow - or indeed to use one of the exchanges others have suggested.

Neither you nor I have a very long history on reddit. Either of us could be ready to sell our reputation on this site for £100. Trust between total strangers without someone will to act as a mediator is going to be tough.

Another alternative might be to convert your BTC to LTC or a smaller currency and exchange that on a site like localbitcoins.

And as a final thought, quickbitcoin.co.uk say they only buy 2-5 BTC at a time but they're out of stock almost all the time recently so they *might* be willing to make an exception and buy a smaller amount. It can't hurt to ask them.

This is not how modern politics operates, it's riddled with lobbyists who often determine policy to benefit those they work for.

Anyway the more the public are directly engaged with politics the more likely they will be to educate themselves, right now they feel under represented and that voting is a pointless exercise because politicians just lie to them. 

&gt;The EU is not forcing anything on anyone.

They are, they blackmail a generally ignorant public into staying within the EU. They say to countries like Greece or Cyprus unless they follow their agenda the sky will fall so people feel there's option but to go along with it. Also the high level politicians of various countries are generally working towards the EU agenda and ignore the will of the public, look at how they installed a technocrat in Italy to follow the austerity measures or got rid of the Greek prime minister who wanted to offer a referendum.

I think the midfield trio of Moussa, Sandro and Paulinho worked very well in allowing us to retain possession and break up the play and I'm pretty sure Sandro achieved level 99 beast-mode today. The wingers were great and Walker was fantastic, United got lucky with their first goal IMO. Valencia caused us a lot of havoc on that left side and I think I speak for everyone in saying that we need Rose back ASAP. It also breaks my heart to say it, but Dawson is a liability, we saw that when Welbeck was able to easily knock the ball and run around him in the penalty box. Villas-Boas really stepped  up today in terms of his managerial and tactical choices and a lot of people thought he should have left Lennon in, but I think Townsend is the type of player who can cause problems coming into the game as a sub with his pace and energy, he's just a bit heavy footed at times with his touches. I think we are starting to see a turnaround boys and AVB stunned the shit out of me when he lashed out at Neil Ashton during the post match presser, this guy apparently has some balls after all. The only concern right now, for me, is Soldado. His link-up play today was fantastic but that miss was simply due to lack of confidence from not scoring. I think a striker needs to be purchased during the January window, one who can link up with Soldado or at least offer competition for the lone striker spot. That sucks for big Jol at Fulham but the timing could not be better for us, we need to get 6 points from our next 2 matches and I think that is more than doable.

I could actually see the BoE being very unhappy about the Scots using GBP... after all, it isn't ideal to have ~10% of your currency being circulated by a foreign power (excluding US dollars of course). Ultimately though the BoE answers to Westminster - and Westminster would answer to the rUK so economic policy will not necessarily favor conditions in Scotland. Examples could be GBP operating at higher interests rates to benefit the rUK while causing higher prices and stagnating growth in Scotland. Yes, to some extent it will be in the interests of everyone that Scotland is successful with sterling - but only to a point. Ultimately sterling's measure of success will be its effect in the rUK. I certainly can't see the UK entering into a deliberate currency union - at most Scotland will voluntarily be using sterling without any official say in its management or administration.

It certainly beggars belief that their economic policy is essentially to become wealthy by undercutting the rUK - while simultaneously allowing the rUK to have the final word on their economic policy.

http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21587782-europes-electricity-providers-face-existential-threat-how-lose-half-trillion-euros

&gt;Back in the 1980s, providing electricity was a relatively simple affair. You guaranteed a constant supply of power by building plants that ran on coal, nuclear energy (if you wanted it) or hydropower (if you had it). You ran these full blast around the clock—for technical reasons, coal and nuclear plants cannot easily be shut down anyway. And that provided “baseload power” (the amount always needed). Then, to supply extra electricity at peak times (like lunchtime or early evening) you had plants that could more easily be powered up and down, such as gas-fired ones. If you imagine a chart of power provision during the day, it looks like a layer cake: the bottom layers are flat (nuclear, coal and so forth); the layer at the top (gas) is wavy.

&gt;Deregulation swept away this tidy, ordered system, letting power plants produce according to the marginal cost of electricity. The advent of renewable energy then speeded up the changes. Renewables have “grid priority”, meaning the grid must take their electricity first. This is a legal requirement, to encourage renewable energy in Europe. But it is also logical: since the marginal cost of wind and solar power is zero, grids would take their power first anyway. So renewable energy slots in at the bottom of the layer cake. But unlike the baseload providers already in place (nuclear and coal), solar and wind power are intermittent, surging with the weather. So the bottom layers of the cake are wavy, too.

&gt;Now, when demand fluctuates, it may not be enough just to lower the output of gas-fired generators. Some plants may have to be switched off altogether and some coal-fired ones turned down. This happened on June 16th. It is costly because scaling back coal-fired plants is hard. It makes electricity prices more volatile. And it is having a devastating effect on profits.

&gt;...In such a world, the old-fashioned utilities play **two vital roles**. They will be the electricity generators of last resort, ensuring the lights stay on when wind and solar generators run out of puff. And they will be providers of investment to help build the grand new grid. It is not clear that utilities are in good enough shape to do either of these things.

In short nuclear provides a good baseload but can't be readily adjusted to meet peaks and troughs.  This is where gas and coal come in, because they can be readily adjusted.  Wind may well not coincide with a peak, it might just not be windy, so to not risk a brownout where supply can't meet demand you still need gas and coal as a backup.   

The renewables however are taking subsidies, and then profits from the vital backups at peak times, and driving up their costs.  Not only that but they're regressive by hampering efficiency to the grid and putting back both industry and a feasible long term solution.

Consider the stages of grief: at some point when accepting a tragedy, you get really angry; at another point, you get giddy and manic, denying that life has changed; at another point, you may withdraw, give off no emotion at all.

Now consider the Doctor's personal grief. He's witnessed terrible things, much more terrible than what the average person will experience when they go through the stages of grief. He also has an eternity of time in which to live through these stages, feeling no rush to just drop his baggage and move on with life.

When John Hurts is serious and no-nonsense, that's the Doctor in an Anger phase. When he's absorbed with the pain he's experienced, and just wants to push that pain onto someone else. Anyone who happens to get on his bad side, really. As long as he can feel like at least one other person is suffering alongside him. When Tennant was light-hearted and giddy, he may have been manic, especially when we see his much more serious moments. He's trying to deliberately block out his memories of the pain, but sometimes it just didn't work. When Matt Smith is just....Matt Smith... he may have gone completely out the other end. He's reached a point of grief that's so intense he feels the need to blunt his reality altogether. Let's not be bother by all this destruction and the extinction of my species and all that. Look!

That said:

1.  While most Civil Service jobs are only open to UK citizens and citizens of Commonwealth countries, there are rules that open them to ROI citizens.  It would seem spiteful not to have something similar for Scottish citizens, if Scotland becomes an independent country.

2.   Most Civil Service IT is being moved to (third party) cloud storage.  This in some ways might make outsourcing Civil Service jobs to Scotland viable, since work on remote servers probably wouldn't amount to exporting the data.

On top of that, what about roll-your-owns? Will we have plain risla packets too? How will the different types of risla be represented on the packet without the packet being less plain than the term ""plain"" tends to describe?

Or will it be a lack of graphics and just bold white text describing what's inside? If so, how is that any better than the demand to cover up cigarettes in large retailers that's already being obeyed? Isn't that kind of like giving the same job to two people?

&gt;Greek and Italian politics

The EU didn't 'install' Monti into the Italian parliament. They proposed a senior and respected economist, who the Italian partliament accepted to run a caretaker government. At any time, the Italian parliament could have stopped passing the laws proposed by his cabinet, prompting an election if a new ruling coalition couldn't be found. They didn't, because the elected representatives of the people decided that having Monti was better than having an election in the middle of a crisis.

The EU didn't remove Papandreou. He found himself without enough support to have a majority in government. He stepped down as PM. Following him stepping down, a coalition was reached between two parties to form government. The EU was not involved in this process.

&gt;money theft

Cypriot banks were in danger of going bust. This was one of Cyprus' biggest economic sectors. They needed to bail out the banks, but didn't have the money, so they asked the for assistance. Cyprus' credit rating was already at 'junk' status, meaning they would only be able to get loans on financial markets at ridiculous interest rates that were clearly unsustainable and would lead to default, so they had to finance it another way. The condition for them getting the bailout money was that they finance some of it themselves. This deal was put together by the heads of government and finance ministers of each of the EU's (at the time) 27 member states, the ECB and the IMF. If they would not agree to the terms, the banks would go bust and Cypriot banking customers would lose a great deal more money. To finance part of it, this required that some of the money come from deposits in the stricken banks that had over 100,000 euros in them. Remember, these customers would have lost *all* their money otherwise. This was not money theft. This was assistance to a country who otherwise would have made people lose much more money. This was not using EU funds, and hence the European Parliament didn't get to have a say in it, this was strictly a deal between Cyprus on one side, and the IMF, ECB, and the other EU national governments on the other.

&gt;Tony Benn

I think the first thing you have to realise is that Tony Benn is speaking of an earlier version of the EU. This is back in 2007, before the Lisbon Treaty came into force which gave much greater powers to the EP and greater transparency. The topic of discussion is the (since defeated) Constitutional Treaty and it's effect on British democracy, but regardless he seems to be missing some fundamental points. 

He begins by discussing how he didn't have any legislative power as a member of the Council of Ministers, that it all just came from unelected bureaucrats from above. I'm going to give you a little lesson on how the EU functions. Take the European Commission. The head of the European Commission is the EC President, who is chosen by the European Council (the heads of government of each member state) and who has to be ratified by the European Parliament (EP). As you can see, to get the 'top job' you have to be accepted by people you chose to represent you in the EP, and by the people you elected to run your country. Then there's the European Commission. They're suggested by the EC President, and have to be ratified by the EP. So what we see here is that the Executive is, at all stages, chosen in democratic fashion. The EP (obviously) is as well. There is certainly room for reform here, much of which has been proposed numerous times, to make it even more democratic. This is, in general, opposed by the member states.

What about the Council of Ministers (CoM) then, which is where Tony Benn served and was complaining about at the beginning? Well, these are the relevant national ministers in each country. So if there was a discussion over a bill involving finance, and it came to a vote, both the EP and the CoM (in this case, comprising the national finance ministers from each country) would both have to pass it for it to be signed into law. Remember, CoM members are also appointed through democratic processes in each country (even if it's merely voting the ruling party in that gets to decide it's own cabinet), so functionally this is on average no less democratic than how each national government operated. Aside from that, there are a great number of other avenues for democratic participation by EU citizenry. He mentions that the Council of Ministers meets in secret and is undemocratic. Here he is completely and fundamentally misunderstanding the point of the CoM. This isn't going to be a perfect analogy, but bear with me. In Australia, there is the Senate, and the House of Representatives. The senate represents the interests of each the six Australian states and two territories, the House of Representatives the interests of the people. Similarly, in the EU, the CoM represents the interests of the member states whilst the EP represents the interests of the people. For him to act as if the CoM should be accountable to the people is ludicrous, as the structure of the EU was set up to *limit the power of European citizens on the continental stage in favour of the member states*. It's not there to represent the interests of Europeans, it's there to represent the interests of each country.

So we see that the EC and EC president is pretty analogous to the Cabinet and Prime Minister in the UK. You don't get to vote for them, you vote for people who choose them, and it's not undemocratic, he's just misunderstanding the purpose. 

Then he mentions the part about referendums with respect to the constitutional treaty, well, this part is best answered by /u/Bowgentle [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1m68u2/europeans_now_revive_europe_join_eunow/cc86dcz). 

Coming to European Parliament elections in Britain, he mentions the whole 'we don't vote for an MEP, we vote for a party'. Funnily enough, how MEPs are elected is chosen by each member state individually, provided it follows certain criteria. So to blame the EU for how British people vote for MEPs is absolutely and uncontroversially unfair, blame your own MPs for not having a better voting system for MEPs.

Then he makes a case for intergovernmentalism (countries negotiating together towards a common goal, with each having a veto every step of the way) rather than supranationalism (the way the EU is currently forming, where sovereignty is 'pooled' to bring about greater outcomes than the sum of its parts). He seems to be of the opinion that any laws created by the EU cannot be repealed by the UK. This is untrue, they can be - just under the condition that the UK leave the EU first. The UK doesn't, because through the process of pooling it's sovereignty (supranationalism) it gains far greater benefit than it loses.

He also praises the Swiss agreement with the EU and the way the Swiss run their democracy, ignoring that many EU laws have to be implemented within Switzerland with Switzerland having absolutely no say in the matter (it's called fax machine diplomacy) to take advantage of some of the EUs benefits. Similarly, they can also just 'quit' those agreements if they think the cost is greater than the reward, as the UK can leave the EU if it decides the same.

So in sum, he fundamentally misunderstand the purpose of the CoM, dismisses the European Commission as 'bureaucrats', criticizes how British citizens vote for MEPs (despite that being the business of the member state, and not the EU), praises Switzerland for being freer for not being EU members, despite them having no say in EU legislation that they have to implement.

As an aside I find it amusing that he complains that MNCs are more powerful than nationstates, but he'd prefer to have a smaller 'face' to the world as the UK, rather than as the EU which would be much better able to protect British interests against MNCs than the UK could. His point that the WTO and the IMF aren't elected is also loony and completely irrelevant, and seems like the kind of bullshit spouted by people that have only just come into political awareness. And on a related note, we come to lobbying

&gt;lobbying

Lobbying is not evil. Think about how the political process works. This will be simplified, of course You elect an MP. They may or may not be educated at university. Regardless, they'll never be omniscient. A bill comes along that they will need to vote for, but they're not educated so how do they figure out who they should vote for? Ask the experts of course! This will give them a basic grounding in the subject, but to know how it is going to affect companies, they would have to ask the companies themselves. Companies, helpfully, send out representatives to say what concerns they have about a bill. It's up to the MP to balance the concerns of the people (who he represents), the concerns of the company (who employ people in his electorate, that he wants to see continue being employed), and political pragmatism (making sure the bill can go through and it's not going to cost the MP the next election). The actual situation is a great deal more complicated, but this gives you a simple understanding of why lobbyists are needed and important.

&gt;politicians are evil

Well, I don't know how to argue this. Yes, they are, and no they're not. Politics is complicated as fuck. It requires you to make hard choices and to frequently compromise your personal values. But lets imagine how 'John' sees an evil politician. A bill is before him that will cut subsidies to a big factory in his electorate. John's dad works at that factory, and he doesn't want to get laid off, and the MP doesn't want that to happen either. But his party need this to go through as part of a comprehensive economic reform package, so John's MP votes for it knowing it's in the best interests of his country. Now, did this MP do the right thing? Surely he should be defending the people in his electorate, right? The guy is just evil! Well, no, because he had to balance the needs of the country, his party (who he is loyal to, they helped him get elected and made sure to secure funding for new roads a year ago), and the electorate. And this time, the electorate had to lose out because if every MP would vote purely based on the needs of their electorate, nothing would get done (the MP from a rich electorate would disagree with the earlier road funding bill for Johns MP because there would be no benefit for the rich electorate).

Sterling wasn't that bad against Hull but he needs to learn when to release the ball or do something other than run directly at defenders. He has the talent and the potential so starting again against Norwich seems the right thing to do.

Aspas was good when not playing as the No.10, in preseason he was either the main striker or playing slightly to the right and he done well. A game against Norwich where he would have a better chance of scoring than say west ham seems the better option.

A central midfield of Henderson and Allen would show we have an alternative to Lucas/Gerrard. I also think that both would have more energy. Granted defensively they can both lose concentration and make rash challenges but these can be ironed out with experience of playing together.

true,Furthur_slimeking,lfc99,,"I think almost all of the blame has to lie at his door. He picked the wrong lineup in the wrong formation for this game, and when it was clear that things weren't working out, he had no contingency plan.

  Henderson cannot play in that position. He lacks the technical finesse and creativity. His touch was poor, his passing was atrocious, and his decisions were often inexplicable.

  Gerrard offered very little. While he's been effective for most of the season so far, I think he, the club and the fans need to accept that at his age he has significant limitations. We need to sign a top class dynamic midfielder to take the helm.

  Sterling put in a lot of effort, but was ineffective. In his defence, he was given nothing to run on to and very few outlets, and I'm surprised the referee didn't blow on a couple of occasions when he was knocked to the floor without the defenders attempting to play the ball. There is a point where ""muscling someone off the ball"" becomes an illegal obstruction. His body strength will improve in time.

  Moses... While I think some people are assessing him unfairly harshly, I'm not convinced of his commitment. He says he is disappointed to not play more, but when he's handed a start he doesn't really seem to gel with the rest of the team. That said, he suffered in the same way that Sterling did: he was given the ball in awkward positions with nobody to support him.

 Suarez looked poor from the start. Initially, it looked like he wasn't fully fit. When the game, and his performance, continued to work against him, he withdrew into himself and seemed so preoccupied with his individual performance that he stopped linking with the rest of the team.

 Coutinho was effective and lively in his brief cameo, but he didn't have much to work with in terms of link up play.

  Skrtel put in a good shift, Toure was sub-par, Flanno and Johnson seemed unsure of what role they were supposed to play, but all of the goals we conceded were primarily the result of the midfield and attack being completely inept, losing possession through sunday league passing and then being caught on the back foot, making the defenders job almost impossible when Hull exploited our mistakes.


  It seems to me that BR did not brief the team adequately and did not work on his game plan in training. The players didn't seem to know where to expect one another to be at any given point. This is not the first time that BR has shown himself to be either unable to unwilling to effectively respond to an opposition who are not playing in the way he had anticipated.

 Hull, if I'm completely honest, didn't play well. They were opportunistic, but that's it. We handed them their chances on a plate.. When you pull the plug out of the bath, the water eventually goes down the hole, no matter how dirty it is. They didn't really create anything - we created their chances for them. They were mediocre. We were utter shit. Honestly, it was fucking horrendous. It was like watching you dog run under the wheels of a bus, survive, then do it twice more until it was spread over the road like vomit outside a kebab shop on friday night.

Sahko nees game time and although I wondered about who to drop I'd go with Skrtel as I think Kolo would be a better partner for Sakho.

Norwich will play 5 across the middle. They have young mobile players not unlike Hull so Henderson and Allen as the main two to combat the running of Norwich. 

Sterling needs games he needs to learn that running in a straight line means a defender will easily dispossess him and he needs to add a trick or two or learn to slightly change direction at full speed. Also his choice of pass needs to be better. This will come with games and as such I'd start him again.

Aspas needs games full stop. Also looking at the up coming fixtures Norwich have the worst defensive record so there's more of a chance that he'd score against the canaries. I'd play him as an inside right as he did okay there and as an out and out striker in preseason and we shouldn't judge him on the few games in the no.10 position at the start of the season

That leaves Alberto who I picked over Coutinho. Phillipe has a knock and deserves a game off to recuperate as we can play Luis. Which brings me to Suarez, who also is carrying an injury. Unfortunately, due to the lack of options or the dramatic drop in form of others we'll need him to soldier on. The only worry I have is that if the frustration levels get too much will he keep the temper under control. There were a few things against Everton and Hull that were a little nasty and petulant and giving the little magician a break before he forces one on himself should be high on Rodgers priorities.",0,1385947792,null,0,false,0,cdrcp3t,t3_1rv7ie,t1_cdrcp3t,t3_1rv7ie,null,1428433830,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

6: The End of Time
7: The Voyage of the Damned
8: The Next Doctor

And here's why:

1: A Chirstmas Carol
A stone cold classic. Great direction super cool timey-wimey take on a Dickens classic. Michael Gambon being brilliant. Overall a top-notch episode of Doc Who.

2: The Snowmen
Brilliant reintroduction of Clara, fun with the Peternoster gang (or whatever we're calling Strax, Jenny and Vastra). Cool performances from Richard E Grant and Ian Mackellen (see what I did there). Lots of fun to be had... oh and that excellent shot of the Tardis on the cloud and the camera swooping right in there. Magic.
3: The Christmas Invasion
Despite not being in it for most of the episode this is a great intro for the 10th Doctor. It gave me goosebumps to see people standing on the tops of buildings and there being no Doctor there to sort it all out.

4: The Runaway Bride
We all love Donna now don't we. Might have been skeptical at first but this is a great little romp. The plots a bit all over the place but it's fun and christmassy (even if it's clearly mid-summer) and the motorway chase is the stuff dreams are made of... and emotional too!

5: The Doctor The Widow and the Wardrobe
Bill Bailey is great in this and it's a great little twist on Narnia and on other x-mas traditions... the christmas trees and the baubles and it's another neat Moffat plot. It feels super festive.

6: The End of Time
Slightly disappointing but the Masters plan has a twisted brilliance to it even if the rest of the story is a bit pants. The real star of the show though is Bernard Cribbins as Wilf. He never fails to bring a tear to my eyes. Tragic and magnificent all at once. Gotta love him.

7: The Voyage of the Damned
Doctor who does disaster movie... not particularly well. It's all a bit too much techno bable and an insurance scam although an apt motive seems a little naff considering the scale of the situation. Max is brilliantly played and Kylie isn't half bad but it just doesn't really hang together for me. The Heavenly Host are a nice tribue to The Robots of Death though, and Starship Titanic a lovely nod to Douglas Adams. I just wish it was all a bit simpler and tidier.

8: The Next Doctor
Not to my taste. I love stomping Cybermen in Victorian London as much as the next person. More in fact. But the Cyberking is underused and doesn't look as steampunk as it ought. The whole next Doctor plot feels a bit forced and self referential for a xmas episode and the plot is resolved a bit too easily, all a bit deus ex machina. Lots of nice production design to enjoy though. But you sort of feel Tennant's end approaching and the wind being let out somewhat with this and the other specials.

That's my 20 cents worth anyways. I'm looking forward to the Time of the Doctor.

Secondly by the beginning of the 20th century there was already a supremacist narrative within the Imperial one. This was carried through until the independence movements of various countries were able to break free. The Indian independence movement was never allowed the option of becoming something like home rule because of race, even though prominent figures such as Jinnah wanted to have it so.

Thirdly, places like India had their entire institutional framework upended and restructured to suit the asset stripping project that was Empire. For example, Indian courts ran on Farsi and Urdu as languages of bureaucracy. The language was changed to English, with all those who were in the previous system suddenly disenfranchised. 

So no, I don't buy any of it.

every Dalek was stirring through the long time-space trip.

The trap was laid out at the planet with care

in hopes that the Doctor soon would be there.

---

The Dalek ship shuddered as it came to a halt

and bristled with weapons prepared for assault.

Not one note of dissent, nary a tiff

as all Daleks agreed to target Cardiff.

---

When on the main deck there arose such a wheezing

that Dalek hearts stuttered, their green blood a'freezing.

Away to their stations they rolled with a hiss

as appearing before them - the Doctor's TARDIS.

---

""What is this??,"" the lead Dalek says,

facing a man wearing bow-tie and fez!

In jacket with long tails and sharp pair of pants

the Doctor emerged with 8 assistants.

---

""Now Nyssa! Now, Tegan! now, Wilfred and Clara!

On, River! On, Adric! On Donna and Sarah!

To the top of the TARDIS! To the top of the wall!

Now run away! Run away! Run away all!""

---

As dry leaves that before the oncoming storm fly,

When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.

So around the TARDIS the companions flew,

With a sonic screwdriver and the Doctor too!

---

The Daleks commenced with their lasery beams

searing and cutting the walls at the seams

as the Doctor and friends ran all round the room

and computers exploded with bang and with boom.

---

The Daleks complained as they blew up their ship

and ""No toys for you,"" the Doctor did quip

as he and his friends got back in the box

and slammed the door closed and locked all the locks.

---

As the TARDIS diminished and doomed Daleks did hate

and in unison screamed, ""exterminate!""

They heard the Doctor exclaim, ‘ere he drove out of sight,

""Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!""

I know the circlejerk on here after the win is basically ""Told you so Jose, I told you you'd win if you played Mata!"" but it took him a solid 25 minutes to get into the game at all. He made some efforts to track back, mostly to no avail; he's just not going to win challenges like Oscar will. Once Lampard came into the game to provide a semblance of steel to cover for Mata's defensive frailties, he was freed to work his magic, which was fantastic to watch. His assists were smart; his deliveries were sometimes inconsistent; he did get caught in possession annoyingly sometimes. In the end, he looked better without Oscar on the pitch and definitely left his mark on the game in a performance that, though inconsistent at first, was definitely promising but not at all sensational. 

TL;DR: He tried hard to get back, but trying and actually defending are two different things. Once Jose covered for those defensive failings, he had a fantastic second half going forward.

I think I'm trying to say that: because 11 is the one who technically starts the adventure (the beginning of the Doctor's timelines in the adventure) and he's the one at the end of his own timelines as the Doctor, that's why he remembers it?
