true,Eddie_Hitler,cnty-uk,Scotsman in East Anglia,"I'm Scottish currently living in the south of England.  England is definitely better in certain parts of the north like Northumberland especially - lovely to look at, friendly locals etc.

The south unfortunately is rife with people who are rude, self-centred and often genuinely stupid.  The north-south rivalry is utterly pathetic and totally overlooks the Channel Islands, Devon and Cornwall.  

I must say Norfolk made me feel very uncomfortable as it was basically Deliverance: UK, with Suffolk not far behind.  A lot of people down there seem to be rude as well as often genuinely stupid.

Ipswich in particular was full of some of the stupidest and rudest people I have ever met anywhere, and I've lived in London.",0,1377892101,null,0,1377892303,0,cbyl878,t3_1lepeh,t1_cbyl878,t1_cbyhpta,null,1429644251,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Otherwise St Paul's square area is great, as is the Mailbox and Brindley Place with plenty of places to eat and some good bars. The Victoria is a good night too, and the Island bar for cocktails. It's almost local rules that you need to experience a place called Snobs at least once while you're in Birmingham. Get all your uni mates to go and you'll have a great night!

It's worth having a wonder round the Jewellery Quarter. Personally my favourite part of town. Vertu, The Vaults are nice bars, but my usual hangouts are the Red Lion (best burger in Brum!) and The Lord Clifton.

true,amaurosisfugax,eng-manchester,Scot in Greater Manchester,"This particular fucktastrophe only exploded a couple of weeks ago when the council decided to refuse one of the University's more hedonistic halls (Murano in Maryhill) their HMO license. To be fair to the uni, the main reason seemed to be that the various tenants over the past 20 years have done a very good job in wrecking the place. However this doesn't help your problem much.

How long are you required to stay in the makeshift halls for if you accept a room there? If it's not long, one option may be to stick it out for a month until you've made enough connections to get a crew together for a flatshare.

Another good course of action would be to contact the [SRC](http://www.src.gla.ac.uk/) and lobby them to organise a minibus service to the city centre. They run the minibus service and seeing as there probably wont be a need for the murano one for a while it may actually turn out to be a feasible solution to your transport costs. The SRC also are the student advocates in the university senate and so are the people to engage if you want to force the university to do more for you and everyone else stuck in the city centre halls.

You may also want to cross-post this to r/glasgow who may be able to provide you with more pertinent advice than the majority of comments in r/unitedkingdom.

Also, bear in mind that Glasgow has 28 days in which to appeal the council's decision.

true,Tbickle,flair1,,"&gt;Does the sale of Bale make it all different? 

I think, yes, in a way.  The clubs you listed and others like them do this EVERY window.  Maybe they don't bring in 7-8 players, but they are constantly just buying, buying, buying. Sometimes it appears that they're just buying to have the player on the roster or so nobody else can have them.


What Levy, Baldini, and AVB have done is something different. Yes, we bought huge and we bought heavy.  AVB had a year under his belt and combined Spurs came up with a new direction, a new vision for the club. That's the difference. Madrid buys the player of the moment to keep building on what they already have. ""We"" have essentially replaced the entire engine of our team. We're younger, more versatile, will play in different formations, and will be more able to fit the vision of AVB's style of play moving forward. 


This was not just greed, this was the perfect timing of a newer coach getting the support and buy-in of the Director to fulfill a vision for a new team. This is the result, and it's amazing to watch.

I think the truth of the matter is both the government and the rebels have been using chemical weapons which of course makes both parties demonstrate war crimes, but then who do you support? 

The way I see it (and I am rational like this) is that it is the **Syrian Civil war**. And so there is no one side who is more deserving than the other.

If he needs to be punished, then let the ICC try him and punish him. 

I, like pretty much everyone else, think he's a despot and a war criminal. - But we're not talking about how *wrong* he is and how *right* it is to send a few hundred missiles at him because of it.

I know this is perhaps a comment for the other thread, but since I'm here; I'm glad the vote failed for several reasons:

Are we sure? Are we sure it was him? Why can't we wait for the United Nations to complete it's investigation? What's so pressing that we cannot wait for the investigation to be carried out? Why was Parliament recalled 5 days early? Are we playing to the timetable of America? Why?

Why was the motion so unspecific? Why, if the sole objective is to 'alleviate humanitarian suffering' military action is referenced? Why was Labour's perfectly reasonable amendment voted against by the government? 

Why is this our job? It's not, it's the job of regional powers to exert pressure to resolve the situation in Syria. They're bound to be more effective. I have infinitely more confidence in the diplomatic efforts of the Arab League and Saudi Arabia putting on pressure than I do the pressure that a few hundred missiles put on.

true,simick,eng-essex,Essex,"So this seems like as good a place as any for my completely unrelated rant about Currys.

Went in a few weeks ago to buy a TV for my girlfriend's flat. Having chosen the TV, the following approximate exchange took place:

""So what are you connecting this TV to?""

""A Sky+ box""

""Ah, and what HDMI cable are you going to be using?""

""The one that came with the Sky+ box""

By this point my scammy sense is tingling, because I know exactly what's going to happen next. We get dragged over to their HDMI cable display, where they have two TVs set up side by side, one with a noticeably better picture.

The assistant (who as it turns out, is the shop manager), proceeds to try and upsell a ~£60 HDMI cable, with the threat of having a shit picture if we don't. For anyone who doesn't know, there is [absolutely](http://www.tested.com/tech/3329-the-difference-between-cheap-and-expensive-hdmi-cables/) [no](http://www.expertreviews.co.uk/home-entertainment/1292371/expensive-hdmi-cables-make-no-difference-the-absolute-proof) [fucking](http://www.mediacollege.com/hardware/connectivity/hdmi/premium-cable.html) [difference](http://www.ohgizmo.com/2010/04/01/premium-hdmi-cables-more-of-a-ripoff-than-you-think/) between a £2 and a £200 HDMI cable, in terms of image quality.

After telling him this, in relatively few words, he scurried off to get my girlfriend's TV (much to my chagrin, as I was ready to leave for being lied to already). That's when, on closer inspection, I saw that the 'shit' TV was connected via a standard definition [composite cable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCA_connector).

So, the entire stand, which was presumably endorsed by Currys HQ (as it had all their marketing material featured), was a **complete lie**. They were comparing a standard definition connection to a high definition connection, and claiming that the latter was the result of a &gt;£60 HDMI cable.

TL;DR: Currys try to systematically scam unwitting buyers out of £60+ for useless HDMI cable 'upgrades'.",0,1377899358,null,0,false,0,cbynzhi,t3_1levsl,t1_cbynzhi,t3_1levsl,null,1429642891,33,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,33

Read the whole thing if you have time &amp; the author made it quite easy to understand and follow.
The actual costs for deals are not so simple as they seem to be, for eg, the Andy Carroll 35 mill pounds we paid was not a straight fee, it was supposed in installments over 5.5 years. 

The whole money situation regarding FSG spending will become clearer, also very interesting point about the current debt on liverpool fc.

In a nutshell, copy/pasted from the article

""If FSG plans to sell the club for a “quick buck” – it certainly has not shown in the way the club is being managed.

That would entail slashing the wage bill massively to bring it down to levels of similar clubs in sixth to eighth position in the league table. A lot of the reduction in wage bill has been by accident rather than design: Kuyt, Bellamy and Maxi left the club on their own volition rather than being pushed out. Running the club as business would entail having a clear-out period preceding any new players purchase. FSG have continually invested in the club throughout. Many suggested that FSG bought the club for “peanuts” while recent academic papers, published by Tom Markham from Reading’s ICMA Centre, suggested that the club’s recent valuation of £352M was not far from the price that FSG paid for it and is substantially less than Forbes’ £530M valuation in April 2010.

On the bright side, LFC’s expected revenue for 2012-13 should show a £30M increase in commercial revenue alone since the FSG takeover in 2010. Compare this increase with the UEFA’s Champions League distribution of €23M to Arsenal, €33.3M to Manchester United, and €23.7M to Manchester City for participating in the group stages in 2011-12. The new TV deal should also add £25-30M to the club’s coffers in 2013/14 onwards.""

I was agreeing with your comment up until you wrote that.

However, his starting position in the team is vital due to his strong defensive ability, huge amounts of energy and pace and his strength on the counter attack (which was so effective today).

If anything, Lampard should be rotating in and out. I love Lamps but I don't think he should be playing 4 90 minute games in short succession. He didn't offer a huge amount to the table today whereas Ramires was very pro-active in winning the ball and moving it forward - a strength which Mourinho clearly values, as has been [mentioned before](http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/8785927/).

  Two days!!! Fuck are you insane? The plumbing alone would take at least, two days. Not  to mention the removing of the step-up before, setting new tile. Also another one of  what you, consider minor differences is the removing the cubby holes Drywall then paint. You'r  looking at a week at least with multiple crews working weird hours. Then the DIY factor, plus trips to local supply shop that at least adds 2 weeks onto your original  ""2  days"".  What you fail to notice is that the ""room's"" walls have some how moved closer together by at least 6 inches. Then extend the room making the tub further back from the Toilet.

true,matcht,lfc12,,"I actually agree with you, it will take time for them to learn to play together and adapt to new conditions. Also, there aren't many players at Spurs who have been at the club for a long time (only Dawson, Lennon and Defoe really) so they don't have that to help things settle down.

But the quality that Capoue, Paulinho, Soldado, Lamela and Eriksen bring them is undoubted. Paulinho already looks amazing, and from his performances for Brazil he will be one of the best midfielders in the league. Capoue is a big upgrade on Parker, same with Soldado over Adebayor. He will get them 20-25 goals this season, which they have needed for a while. Lamela and Eriksen might be young but they have been the most highly touted youngsters around, and both were key players for Ajax and Roma from such a young age. That shows how good they can be. 

Even if they don't pull away from us and Arsenal this season, they certainly will next season at this rate.

I felt from last season that we were moving in a similar direction to Spurs, but that we were a few years behind them in developing a standard of play, and structure in the club. This window they've moved firmly ahead in terms of their squad, and with the sale of Bale probably close to an even net spend. If they do get CL football this season, and given the strength and financial clout of City, Chelsea and United, it is a long long way back for us with our undervalued player signings and focus on youth in fighting for 4th. It's a harsh reality, but Spurs can cement themselves as one of the big 4 over the coming years. They play good football, have a young manager with potential and has won things, and a shrewd transfer operation with Baldini and Levy. Now their billionaire owner is willing to loosen the purse strings, how can we possibly come back from where we are with that happening. The only thing holding them back is their stadium, but if they get CL football income they will be a lot closer to building it.",0,1377901657,null,0,false,0,cbyos20,t3_1lfcxr,t1_cbyos20,t1_cbyobmp,null,1429642521,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

I am English and live in England but currently visiting my Scottish family, including my mum, in Scotland and I have to say I really envy how less built up it is compared to England. Because of this, towns tend to all be linked by train and it feels really nice. Towns also tend to be better designed, kind of like new urban areas such as West Swindon or Milton Keynes rather than all these closely built up town centres with thin single roads. There are exceptions, but there's a feeling of lots of space and, from where I am which is the east coast between Dundee and Aberdeen, I have a lovely view of the Cairngorms. That said, places like the Cotswolds or the Wessex Downs in England have lovely scenery. My journey up here also takes me over the Forth and Tay bridges, which are probably the best bridges in the UK.

Wales feels very similar to England except with barely any motorways due to how close the hills and mountains are. Again, there's variety just like in England, so you have your well laid out duel carriageways and your tight, country lanes. The size of Wales also makes it feel like it could easily be a region of England, whereas Scotland is enormous. It has good beaches like South West England. 

England is really big, it holds 85% of the total UK population. I personally am not really a fan of cities and there's a lot of urban areas. It's hard to really describe, I mean you can find nice scenery like in South West England, Cumbria, Yorkshire, the North East but it's also got lots of major cities like London, Birmingham and the Northern Cities. It sort of feels like a clusterfuck of urban areas, which is why I feel Bristol and Newcastle seem nicer because they look so much more isolated and therefore feel like real centres. Newcastle in particular seems more impressive because of the bridges. It's hard to really describe, I'd imagine if England was as built up as Scotland is then travelling to at least York from Bristol would feel as local as Glasgow to Aberdeen but it's clear in England you're less likely to travel around regularly than you are in Scotland, so there's more differences in English identity than in Scottish identity.

Northern Ireland, from what I've seen, is similar to Scotland in the sense of having glens and loughs but I imagine the two communities and the troubles have certainly shaped it and perhaps hindered it whereas England and Scotland have generally been internally united.

I don't even mind about things being overpriced,  online will always beat in store. But a store should offer at least a modicum of decent service. If they had even said that a member of staff was sick and phoned me to say it couldn't be done today I would have been content.

true,Sparklesnap,flair4,,"The reason i'm so certain is; you have to look at who they'd be replacing on the bench. Seven Bench spots a week, and those look to be filled.

Friedel (GK)
Kaboul/ other CD
Naughton/ Wing Defender.
Sandro (Not fully fit, but good to go for a half-hour or so)
Defoe/Soldado (whoever doesn't start)
You then have 2 spots for 2 of Holtby/Siggurdsson/Dembele/Paulinho/Lennon etc. (our more advanced midfielders) who dont' start.

My guess is that we'll see an unchanged starting XI from the Swansea game, which means our bench likely looks like this;

Friedel, Kaboul, Naughton, Sandro, Defoe, Holtby, Sigurdsson or possibly Lennon, if he's good for a 30 minute run at the end, though I suspect he won't be.

I know Gylfi's been ""poor"" this season so far, but he's got himself into good areas; guy hit the bar twice last game; if you give him 6 inches spend on moving all his shots for the year so far, he could easily have 3 or 4 goals. And moreover, he's been with the team for a year, played in Europe. Won't be put off by the speed &amp; physicality of the game, nor by the atmosphere.

And even if Gylfi doesn't make the bench, one young Thomas Carrol looked very, very good on thursday; You'd think he'd be on the bench ahead of any of the new signings, given that he's played with the first team for a full year now.

No, she has not. From the looks of it, I haven't exactly been missing out.

&gt; As for the influence of ""male genitals are weapons"" style of thinking... it's morphed into the idea that men are somehow more rapey than women. Which is just as bad.

I don't think they are. I'm really not certain why you're trying to prove that that's what I'm saying.

&gt; Then base it off of the source I posted. A feminist group in India successfully campaigned to take a gender neutral law that protected the sexuality of men and boys and make it female-only. (A feminist group in Israel blocked a similar gender neutral law from being created.)

It's pretty non sequitur. I don't know or care what one feminist group in India does. Or Israel for that matter. What they do is not what I do, just because we both call ourselves 'feminists'. I may very well disagree with their methods or goals, and that makes neither of us less of a feminist.

Modric.  By a country mile.  He had the absolute ability to open up a game, to understand where everybody around him was and how best to pass the ball.

Not entirely sure, both are fantastic players.  Bale probably works better as a winger in the 4-3-3 system we're likely to employ.  But in the system we're currently using and have players set up to play I'm not sur either would fit in in their ""best"" positions.

true,simonask,eu,Danish guy in UK,"&gt; If feminism can't be judged by it's belief system (patriarchy, male privilege, rape culture) or the actions of people who call themselves feminists in positions of power or the statements of feminists who are paid to make feminist statements, then what can it be judged by?

False (and useless) pretense. It's possible to be an economist and agree with some colleagues while you disagree with others. It's possible to be a geologist and agree with some colleagues while you disagree with others.

Feminism as a political ideology states one thing, and one thing only: A human being should not be treated differently because of their gender. How you choose to interpret that mission statement is entirely up to you. And before you go there, let me just get it out of the way: The reason it happens to be called ""femi""nism is that women were and still are the gender most urgently in need of aid in the fight against discrimination. Women in India are one such particularly disadvantaged group.

Academic feminism, however, which is to say poststructuralist feminist [literary/sociological/philosophical/etc.] critique, stands up to the same scrutiny as any other method in academia. It is not a political ideology or ""belief system"", any more than poststructuralism or discourse analysis.

They have Soldado to add to the two strikers who kept them in and around 4th last season. I think that is fine to be honest. They could sign a better left back, but I think they are going to give Rose a chance to see how he develops. He was Sunderlands best player for much of last season.

Agree with you on Paulinho, he reminds me of Lampard a few years ago. Genuinely a big goal threat from midfield, but with the energy to defend and press.

true,paul4er,null,null,"Where was I arguing about ""officialdom""? I clearly stated that in British terms, unlike in other countries, flags tend to be de facto things. This is frequently moaned about by pedants in the Flags Institute etc., but the fact is that ""winging it"" tends to be the British attitude on many issues (e.g. no written formal constitution etc.).

From the Act you mention (why quote a slimy politician when you can quote the act directly?) it states very specifically that the term ""government buildings"" relates only to the following 7 specific buildings:
http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisr/2000/347/schedule/made

""Adelaide House, Adelaide Street, Belfast.
Castle Buildings, Stormont Estate, Belfast
Churchill House, Victoria Square, Belfast.
Clarence Court, 10-18 Adelaide Street, Belfast.
Dundonald House, Upper Newtownards Road, Belfast.
Netherleigh House, Massey Avenue, Belfast.
Rathgael House, Balloo Road, Bangor, County Down.""

The main stated purpose of said act (as acknowledged in memoirs of Mandelson at the time) was actually to ensure the Union Jack flew on these buildings (As Peter Mandelson wanted to assure David Trimble before entering Stormont). As I said, I doubt any other flag ever flew on such buildings anyway, and was made to simply avoid the issue as it would never be agreed in the joke pretence of democracy that is Stormont.

The 2002 Royal Mint coin I referred to:

http://www.thelondoncoincompany.com/coinimages/1231435930-2002_Commonwealth_Games_Northern_Irish_Flag_%C2%A32_Silver_Proof_Coin.JPG

It really also does not matter what prats like Mandelson or Hain say, as the fact of the matter is that you are discussing a specific LOCAL flag and there is only one local flag that has ever been endorsed in a democratic manner by the local people of Northern Ireland, and continues being used by many. To say that describing the NI flag ""old"", before the local people of Northern Ireland have democratically said so, is obnoxious is a bit of an understatement, and indicates that you are naive enough to not take the work of devious Republican Wiki-warriors with a pinch of salt.

As for ""sticking head in the sand"", perhaps a good idiomatic response to that for you would be ""not seeing the wood for the trees"". The problem we have isn't petty little issues like what bit of cloth they put outside Stormont, it is that Stormont is a poor excuse for a democracy by any normal standards, and is simply incapable of normal decision making. It is THAT problem which causes minor discrepancies like the former, and those petty issues will not disappear until you address the real issue, something which will realistically take decades.

Finally, I'll reiterate that I am happy with you designing away. I just think you are going about it in the wrong manner if you think that prematurely calling the NI flag ""old"" is going to get you many friends.

Eriksen is good, but not amazing and I think he'll spend substantial time on the treatment table.  Spurs did need a CAM badly though to feed Soldado so he makes sense for them (a more expensive, less talented, less flexible Coutinho).

true,typhonblue,null,null,"&gt;Feminism as a political ideology states one thing, and one thing only: A human being should not be treated differently because of their gender.

Obviously it doesn't because you're also saying:

&gt;The reason it happens to be called ""femi""nism is that women were and still are the gender most urgently in need of aid in the fight against discrimination. Women in India are one such particularly disadvantaged group.

You can't be a feminist unless you also believe that women are bigger victims than men. Unless you support women's social role of victim.

Incidentally, according to this [study...](http://wcd.nic.in/childabuse.pdf) boys are more likely to be subject to sexual abuse in India than girls. (Even though the study excluded forms of sexual abuse that boys are particularly prone to ie. being raped by adult women using their vaginas. This [South African study](http://www.equityhealthj.com/imedia/7485627411326330_article.pdf?random=576187) suggests this form of abuse is extremely prevalent. Two out of every five South african boys reported having been sexually abused, 41% reported a female abuser exclusively, 27% both male and female abusers.)

One thing I'd recommend though is making your own lunches and bringing them with you - lunch foods here can add up pretty quickly (at least £2.50 a lunch, for a basic sandwich and drink). If you don't, try to pick somewhere that has loyalty cards so you can get free stuff every so often  - Boots have a good loyalty card system and a fair selection of sandwiches and salads, I use them quite often and as a bonus you can gain points on all the pharmaceutical things as well.

As a student, my living standards will probably be lower than yours, but I'm living on around ~£11,000 a year (combination of student loans, grants and some small income) and although at times I'm a bit pushed for cash, that's because I spend my money on stupid crap rather than because I actually don't have enough.

If you find a room on gumtree and pay attention to where has good deals going (Movie House cinemas have screenings for something like £3 on Tuesdays I think - someone correct me, but there is some sort of deal like that near the city centre), and cut down on extra costs like eating out at lunch every day, then you should be fine!

true,ninereeds314,null,null,"Seriously, almost anyone should be able to change a power supply and a graphics card. For the last two decades, these things have been *designed* so that pretty much anyone can do it.

Where I'm cautious is changing the processor, processor cooler and/or the motherboard. Reasons...

  - Connecting the correct cables to the motherboard for the power switch, reset button and similar can be a bit of a pain - fiddly, and you need the motherboard manual to know which pins for which connector.

  - I'm not too confident about how much thermal gunk to put between the CPU and cooler.

Other than that, it's worth being it bit more careful with RAM too, and checking the motherboard manual to see which slots you should use first.

The rest, as long as you follow do basic common sense stuff, is fairly easy. The most important thing - use sensible tools, the right screws for the right holes, and the right cables/connectors. If it doesn't fit you're doing something wrong - don't force it. Most things will only fit where they're supposed to go. Notable exceptions I know of - molex power connectors (for PATA hard disks and optical drives) and DDR1 RAM. IOW, things that shouldn't be an issue now.

After that, if air can't get to/from a fan, that fan can't do its job so something will probably overheat. Some extension slots tend to be useless because of graphics card fans, for example. It's a sad fact of life that when a motherboard has two PCI extension slots, the odds are that neither will be usable - one will be directly blocked by the graphics card cooler, and the other will probably need to be left unused to allow the air to flow. Sometimes you can get low-profile extension cards that can salvage one of those slots. Luckily, extension cards usually aren't a big issue now the way they once were - most things are already on the motherboard anyway.

That said, I know a guy who runs a small PC shop, and a month or so ago he got a PC in for repair because ""the sound card doesn't work"".

When the PCI sound card didn't fit in the PCI Express (ie completely different) slot, it had been pushed in anyway (to the side of the PCI express slot, but still in the case slot) and a wood-screw was put through the motherboard, presumably to hold the sound card ""in place"". Seriously.

Extra fun fact - he had perfectly usable PCI slots, at least until he ruined the motherboard by putting a wood-screw through it. And the motherboard probably had better sound than the ancient budget soundcard he'd ""installed"".

So the truth is that some people *are* too stupid to upgrade a PC, but not very many.

To me Scotland and Wales are very similar: largely mountainous, most of the population live in a strip of land to the south of the country, native Celtic language used mostly in the west, share a border with England, confusing yet mostly nice accents, ferries to ROI... Etc etc

Likewise SW Scotland and NI are very similar.  Including dealing with all the BS that goes with the Old Firm, or former Old Firm, not sure what to call them nowadays.

England is the odd one out.  Not that I dislike it, London excepted (big city thing more than a London thing), just... It's noticeably different.  More built up, big towns and cities everywhere, few areas you can truly escape into nature.  OK, some areas are quite similar to parts of Scotland, but those parts are generally very close to the border.  England just, I dunno...

Then parliament would vote, and consider whether the evidence was sufficient to mount specific ""efforts to alleviate humanitarian suffering by deterring use of chemical weapons and does not sanction any action in Syria with wider objectives."" The first amendment also anticipates that the Assad regime is responsible for the attacks, and the government claims this is based upon intelligence reports indicating that they are the only actors to have the delivery capacity for such an attack.

The second motion asks that the security council have ""voted"" on the matter ""in the light of"" the weapons inspector reports (although interestingly it does **not** predicate itself upon the security council voting in favour), making it a different way of writing the exact same bill. The only actual difference in the two texts is ""The production of compelling evidence that the Syrian regime was responsible for the use of these weapons""- this in itself is the real and fundamental difference. The government will claim that our intelligence services are in the process of providing such evidence, and otherwise that in the days that have passed since the attack there shall be little to no evidence remaining for the UN inspectors to find, and that indeed the inspectors have no remit or means to attribute blame, merely assert the fact that weapons were indeed used, making ""compelling"" evidence both unspecific yet still difficult to satisfy. This is likely one reason why Cameron referred to Iraq poisoning the well, as people do not trust our security sources anymore.

Asides from the second motion requesting ""compelling evidence"" of Assad's guilt, which we cannot anticipate yet, there is little to no real difference between the two. This is largely because the first motion was written largely to accommodate earlier suggestions tabled by all parties, which is also presumably why No. 10 kicked off and accused Miliband of playing domestic political advantage and splitting the house.

Either way, both motions called for intervention after a parliamentary vote, and that that was to take place following further developments at the UN over the next few days. The first motion did also however state that parliament:

""Agrees that a strong humanitarian response is required from the international community and that this may, if necessary, require military action that is legal, proportionate and focused on saving lives by preventing and deterring further use of Syria's chemical weapons""

Whether this can be interpreted as allowing action before further UN dialogue is open to debate. Within the context of the motion it says that the UN must be allowed to do its work, so in likelihood it would not allow for an unvoted for strike.

TL:DR

Both motions called for waiting until after the UN had worked its way through and a parliamentary vote agreed action. The second motion was more prescriptive in what particular conditions were fulfilled, although in content the motions were almost identical.

Schürrle was fantastic on the right wing. So refreshing to have a proper quality winger there. 

Cech was absolutely amazing. He made a handful of incredible saves, and a bucketful of really good ones.

Torres had a very good performance. He linked up very well with  Schürrle very well.

Hazard was the mastermind of the first goal, and obviously scored that great second. Best performance this season from him. More of the same please!

When approaching the junction a great many people- including myself- have been mistaken in thinking that they have right of way to continue ahead. 

A driver has responsibilities when driving, you are right, which is why this man has been punished. The loss of life he caused is devastating, but to say that the cyclist's life is less than anyone else's is entirely disingenuous and self-serving to your own views. 

Accidents like this can and do happen to a lot of people. It is an accident with blame placed on the driver. He didn't purposefully ram the car into the cyclist. He had no malicious intent. He was taking his family out for the day. 

Your comments are inclined towards thinking that this family man, this responsible man who didn't flee the scene, who accepted responsibility and who is genuinely remorseful- and will have to deal with the aftermath of having caused the death of another human being- should be hung, drawn and quartered because the man he killed was on a bike. It has utterly nothing to do with who he killed- be it a paedophile on a bike or a nun on a unicycle.

This man has been punished in weight with his crime. Though the loss of life is sad and terrible for those close to the victim, causing more suffering to the man who accidentally caused this death- and his family- is the reason why we don't allow victim's families to punish perpetrators and why our judicial system is proportional.

I hope you never find yourself in this man's position. To accidentally harm or kill another human being and have to suffer as he will be.",0,1377911543,null,0,false,0,cbyrw49,t3_1ldzcx,t1_cbyrw49,t1_cbya3it,null,1429641068,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,"I have felt at times some similar hesitancy to you, but I think this window is a combination of three elements that make it different:

1.  Huge income from Bale's departure, as well as a history of selling for profit.  We've recouped huge fees for Berbatov, Modric and Carrick in recent years, and at worst, a player like Lamela, Eriksen or Chiriches will move on in 2-4 years for double what he cost us, which actually ends up being good financial sense.

2.  A young manager with a clear direction for the club.  This isn't Harry Redknapp, trying to squeeze cheeky deals through for moderately gifted players again and again.  This is a guy with ambition and emotional investment in the club, wanting to take us to the next level.  We haven't just done what City, Real and Chelsea have done over previous seasons, which is buy big for the sake of buying big, regardless of who the manager is... all the players we have now are fairly consistent in terms of an ethos and vision for the way the team will play.  Arguably only this summer has City finally done something similar.

3.  We've tried squeaking into the top 4 through previous transfer policies, and failed.  Like it or not, football is as much of a financial game as it is a sporting one.  And the financial windfall of consistently being in the Champions League is too big to miss out on.  Ever since I've been a fan (over 17 years), we've tried to recruit domestically and for little upfront investment.  And it hasn't worked.  Some years we've gotten closer than others, but the road to failure has been paved by dozens of Jenases, Bentleys, Midos, Chimbondas, and more.  So either we can keep signing the Peter Crouches of the world and hoping the stars will align long enough for them to power us into the Champions League for a season or two, or we can go the high risk, high reward route and actually invest in a way that could reap massive dividends.",0,1377912994,null,0,1377913280,0,cbysbu9,t3_1lf9g2,t1_cbysbu9,t3_1lf9g2,null,1429640865,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

I'm like what happened to us, maybe I'm Annotaterapping too much
I been missing your touch, sometimes I'm out and I lust
What if love ain't enough, and all we have is this trust
What if I'm fucking that up, so you don't trust in me much
I'm wasting your time, to say I'm straight, I'd be lying
It's either you or this music but I can't make up my mind
I'd throw you a line, I'd give you a sign
Right now I'm through with the trying, I think you ready to fly
I settle for less so when I'm tired of stress
I go through with the motions pretending I'm at my best
Fall victim to flesh, I live to be fresh
But this ain't what I expect because my life is a wreck
I run out of breath cause I ain't taking the steps
Money comes and it goes 'til family's all I got left
I'm seeing my growth, but I'm still from myself
You'll be hollering out next because you're ready to fly
I can't find the words so you'll just fill in the blanks
I'm doing the norm and not what it takes
I'll keep folding my cards and you'll keep raising the stakes
'Til we forget about us and what we have is too late
I know in your heart, you ain't conditioned to race
So I steady the wheel, forever pumping the brakes
Resort to the bottle, that's how I deal with the shakes
Pray for these haters, that's how I deal with the hate
Look to the sky, don't be content with the now
You ain't concerned with the why, you just wanna know how
I didn't give her the chance, when you just wanna be down
And save me from myself, but I'm wanting to drown
King is much more than the weight of a crown
As good as it feels, that ain't the way that it sounds
Being single is cool 'til ain't nobody around
Then I'm chasing you down, cause you was ready to fly
I can't be what you want me to be
You're shooting too high cause you ain't aiming at me
One minute you're calling out for the D
Then the next minute you wanna be free
Then the next minute you hollering out peace
Although I know it's a war and they'll be blood in the street
If you call don't be frustrated at me
Just leave you're heart at the beep, cause mine is harder to reach
Cause mine is harder to see
And that don't make it harder to cheat
Being friends would make it harder to breathe
So if you ready to fly, just forget about me
But if you willing to try then I'm willing to leap
Out of the window of pain and fall in love at your feet
I ain't the man you want me to be
I guess that's what's been bothering me",0,1377916109,null,0,false,0,cbyt8qd,t3_1lf8h3,t1_cbyt8qd,t3_1lf8h3,null,1429640438,1,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,1

Think about that; Hulk, who's a perfectly good player, but not world class, is the same player as Bale, just older. Since that year with AVB, Hulk has scored 36 goals in 76 games, a good strike rate, but not a spectacular one.

Bale is a very, very good player, one who, in the right system, has the ability to create that one moment of brilliance that turns a game on its head.

Now the grading system is odd here. Anything above a F is a pass. But a A *-C is considered a higher pass. So yeah there is failing marks. Now foundations test for the basic concepts that the student understands the actual maths etc the basic stuff. Up to simple algebra level. It is more memory test than anything else. Now the higher paper will start off easy and work it's way to advanced stuff. While the foundation is to test basic knowledge/memory, the high paper tests the ability to use those basic concepts and apply them to much more difficult and complex questions. For example a Foundation question work 3 marks could be: If X is 7 what is Y? 13=x+y A question worth the same amount on the higher would be If X is 7 what is Y? 2x=2(x/y) Now this applies the order of mathematics.

Remember the Flesh Doctor from ""The Rebel Flesh""?  Remember how the Doctor implied it would survive and see him again somehow?  Well, due to a quirk in the Time Lord biology, when it copied the Doctor it became quantum entangled with him.  
  
Here's the kicker - the Flesh Doctor has been a puddle of goo all this time, inert.  But when the Eleventh Doctor regenerates, the Flesh Doctor is suddenly re-animated, pulled back to life, but now with the face of the Twelfth Doctor!  
  
He wanders, lost for a time, his memories hazy, until he reunites with others of his kind, one of whom is a redundant copy of Amy Pond.  
  
A nomadic race, they wander space and time, reproducing at first only by creating more exact copies of already-existing Flesh.  As a workaround towards creating genetic diversity in their line, they develop a process of making embryonic duplicates of themselves and planting their young in unsuspecting hosts, allowing them to be raised among  their human host family, much like the cuckoo bird.  These ""assimilated"" Flesh can then reproduce normally and build families of mixed blood, completely ignorant of their true heritage.  
  
Some of them settle in ancient Pompeii, and are the progenitors of Caecilius, and the soothsayer.  Some land on 20th Century Earth, and leave a child amongst the Frobisher family.  
  
Incidentally, The Flesh Doctor's line finds that they alone occasionally create completely different versions during the process - versions that look, incidentally, like previous Doctors.  One of them ends up among Time Lords on Gallifrey, and is named Maxil.  Another is sent to Earth and becomes a dictator.

Ramirez needs to get his shit together and make the right tackles.  That second yellow was uncalled for, he could have clearly won that ball without a foul.  Luiz had a great game too but, he also had a dumb foul.  I know it can be hard to keep your head in the game, especially against the best team in the world.  We just need to be more calm, more cool and make the smart decision when needed.  

Don't hate me for it, I'm just sharing my opinion.  We proved that we have one of the best if not the best defense in europe.  Mind you we didn't have JT in the starting squad.  Also proved that we can be lethal on quick outs.  Schurrle showed that he belongs on that wing, and Torres showed that he still hasn't given up, that he does want to be the starter of our team. Lastly, Lukaku is great, sad to see how it hurt him to miss.  He will grow this year.  Maybe this is what he needed to get on his feet and know that he still needs a lot to work on.

There are 35,000 of these available to Australians every year, if you are granted one it gives you the right to come to live and work here for two years, but you must leave the UK after that.

If none of the above applies, it'll be very, very difficult. /r/IWantOut is Reddit's official emigration subreddit, they can give you all kinds of information about requirements and so on.

Domestic away games are not the place to wear shirts either. I follow Cardiff too and while being escorted in to the stadium one time one of our group was hit by a missile. He never wore his shirt to an away game after that! It singles you out for trouble.

Edit.

I totally agree about helping the club by buying the shirt. I own loads of them and buy one every year (apart from the last year of Hicks and Gillette where I bought the protest shirt instead).

I'll wear my shirt training, or in the house if the game is on, but never to the stadium. The irony!

In a world where one group is oppressed and the other is not, the non-oppressed group would be the one with a strong political lobby like feminism and the oppressed group would be without such a lobby (masculism) - the exact opposite of the world we're living in (at least in all developed nations).

Yeah right. How about you give us something that ""academic feminism"" covers that isn't political ideology and isn't covered in any other academic or scientific field. 
The only reason feminism is even in university is because of political pressure. It's just a token to keep the self-loathing nutters happy, give 'em their own little jargon and fancy titles so they can play scientist with their intellectual dolls.

The only place it should take in university is as a socio-political phenomenon to be studied within the context of an actual academic field. Making feminism itself an ""academic field"" is like making fascism an academic field. Sure the fascists will say it's real and plaster their walls with their particular jargon and credentials but only they will believe it.

I'm here already but I can maybe help you find your way between locations with confidence -  

[Here](http://www.ed.ac.uk/staff-students/students/new-students/arrival/public-transport) is a planner to help you sort out connections until you get to Edinburgh.  

Once you get to Edinburgh, most places you'd want to go are in walking distance, but with heavy luggage you'll probably want some form of transport -

* Lothian busses have a [bus tracker](http://www.mybustracker.co.uk/] (that you can also get as an app for your phone) that lets you see bus routes and real time arrival information on a map of Edinburgh.

* If you'd rather get a taxi, there is a taxi rank outside Waverley station (up the ramp exit, look for the mini roundabout inside the station) and a fare should be no more than £10 to get to Pollock halls / any of the central student areas.

Here are some [maps of the campus](http://www.ed.ac.uk/polopoly_fs/1.20490!fileManager/campus_maps.pdf)

Also, the university usually puts helpers out on the street at various strategic points around the city - they'll be in groups of two or more, wearing red shirts with big University of Edinburgh logos on them.  If you get stuck or lost though you can ask anyone, most people will be very friendly and helpful.

By this method, we could have a global rule of law, with our planet being  run a by democratically decided set of laws, that the UN decides, and it has the muscles and teeth to implement them.

All the evidence I've seen, strongly suggests 'all men are cousins', whether we want to be or not. 

Our species wastes a collosal amount of our planet's precious resources, by having each separate nation with it's own army navy and airforce.

**Whats wrong with our new pensions?**


**Our old pension was far too generous and this is generally accepted**, people were getting promoted within their final 3 years (which determined their pension payouts) just to get a huge increase in their lump sum/monthly amount etc. etc. In days gone by this was not a problem as the reality was, firefighters died pretty soon after retiring due to a career of being abruptly awaken to have 100 seconds to be dressed and rolling on blues alongside poorer health and safety standards. These days those pesky H&amp;S lot would have us all die of old age in our beds


**The protections for those who fail to make it the retirement age of 60**. Our argument is not that we want to retire at 55 or even 50, it's what happens to the majority of firefighters of whom the governments own report stated as men being ""unlikely to be able to remain operational passed 55, let alone to 60"" and female firefighters pretty much being lucky to make it passed 50 at all. With the new pensions, should firefighter become unable to meet operational fitness standards (and these are worryingly, and unrepresentative of the real world, low already) then if they are under 55 they stand to *lose their job and have their pension frozen (not inflation linked) until national pension age* (up to 68 currently if i recall). **So to recap this is someone who's done nothing but a very specific job for all their life paying a large % of his salary into his pension could easily end up getting sacked for incompetence leaving him without any income for up to 18 years at which point they receive their pension which has dwindled 30-50% due to not being inflation linked.** 
 
- But the government says they'll give you a non-operational job within the brigade like they do in the army/police?

- The fire service, particularly with the harsh cuts scarily reducing your fire cover, has very few support staff comparatively. For example my brigade has around 330 Firefighters compared to 131 support staff; Most of which are specialised (I.E. Health and Safety, HR, Legal etc.). There simply is no opportunity for moving operational firefighters to non-operational roles.


**The amount we get back at the end. Firefighters pensions are fairly generous old or new, this is not disputed. What the papers won't mention is th**at we will pay 15.2% of our wages into them for an absolutely atrocious employee/employer ratio of 1/1.05. I don't have their exact figures to hand but no other public sector pay near this amount nor get such a low employer contribution in return for the lower % of their pay they do pay in. Are pensions are slightly better than average because we pay a hell of a lot to them.

**The high risk of an already high contribution rate for 15.2% being increased** due to people leaving/fire service number dwindling/the government raiding the schemes coffers again. For the latter point, the government promised to leave our pensions alone for a minimum of 25 years last time they're drastically cut into them; Here we are again 7 years later, how much worse does it get next time? For the first points, the scheme relies on a stable ratio of people paying into the scheme to retired FFs being paid out by the scheme. Now consider;

- The government has stated they've played a very strict cost ceiling to the pension, if there's a shortfall it's not being made up for by them

- Firefighter numbers are being worryingly reduced all over the country

- Less and less firefighters are signing up to the scheme (based on the last two big brigade intakes)

- There's a back log of people leaving the scheme coming. The government has been increasing our rates for the last 3 years and argue that because there's been minimal leavers that people are happy and that all is well. In reality Firefighters naturally aren't throwing their pension scheme away until it gets decided concretely what the pension will be like which has not been clear for many years now since they announced they were coming for the pensions again. When it finally gets announced there's a very high chance a fair proportion of current paying in members will leave, if only for the security of a pension plan that the government won't have the papers decree as being ""gold plated"" before pillaging it....again. 

The above points could very realistically lead to a ""run"" on the scheme causing the government to have to bail it out effectively. Initial contribution rates increase -&gt; people leave -&gt; Government reviews and finds it needs to make up short fall thus raises contribution rates -&gt; More people leave -&gt; Rinse, repeat.


It's also very well worth noting that **the 15.2% of our pay is an estimate from the government**, they haven't even figured out for sure what it will be. Would you sign a contract for an estimated figure which could very well be more?


Quashing common myths;

- Firefighters sleep all night - We do sleep yes but only between 1am and 7am...if we're lucky. With the exception of the quieter stations (of which are becoming few and far between as brigades all around close more and more stations) the majority of the time you'll be awakened at least once if not 2-3 times after that. Also, bear in mind that our night shift if 15 hours so even with 6 hours ""sleep"" we're still working a 9hour shift. 

- Firefighters all have second incomes - I always find this strange that because we choose to work some more on top of a 42hour average work week we get labelled as greedy but it's true a lot of us, myself included, have second incomes generally in the shape of manual labour (Window cleaning, Gardening, decorating etc.). Anyone with a 9-5 job also has this option available to them in reality in my opinion; Whats the difference between someone who works night shifts then a second job in the day (Fire service) and someone who works in the day picking a second job up in the nights (Joe public)? Obviously personal lives come into it but no more for one group or the other. 

- Firefighters do very little at work but eat and work out - This is perhaps the most pervasive myth and 10 or so years ago it was perhaps closer to the truth. True we get 40minutes a shift to go in station gyms but then, do you want a weak unfit fire fighter coming to rescue you who uses up all their air before they get to you because they're unfit or can't lift you when they do find you? For the rest of the shift we're always training (Fire calls have gone down recently so we have to train so much more to maintain standards), doing community fire safety (Every year 1 and 5 class of schools gets a 2hour+ visit a year and we're slowly but inexorably visiting every house in the country fitting free smoke alarms and giving fire safety advice, to name two main activities), doing paper work, standard testing our equipment (When we need it, we need it to work right. As such everything on the appliance is tested ranging from daily to weekly to monthly and so on) or whatever else we need to be done. Whilst there certainly is nothing to do for us when we're ""sleeping"" at night, it's largely because we work hard in the day and get everything done. 


I'll add more as they come up, please feel free to pick fault and ask questions with any of my points.

This is the point most of this thread is missing. People become as entitled as they are trained to be. He's a brat to us because £5,000 is a huge amount of money to most, but to him it's normal.

The hypocrisy is that most of us actually behave in the same way day to day. For example we're so used to our phones that we can't live without them - we'll even text and drive. Another example is we are so dependant on the internet that if a service goes down for 30 minutes we rage like it's the end of the world. Same with flight delays, heavy traffic and pretty much all first world problems.

50 years ago if you wanted to communicate to someone across the world you sent a letter and waited a month for a reply. Now people get pissed off if network congestion means your sms gets delayed by 2 minutes.

Knowing how to build your own PC is great. It helps to save on costs of getting someone else to do it for you and you'll be more likely to be able to fix future problems yourself, rather than being scared of the contents of your mystical box with flashing lights. 

PC World exist at the same end of the spectrum as high-street bike shops and garage mechanics in that sense. *You* could do the work yourself but you're going to be paying a lot more for someone else to do it for you - and you're at their mercy as to how and when the work is done.

Apart from 4th floor Keynes (not available to freshers), the rooms are basically all the same, so I'd recommend going for first floor - less stairs!  There's an argument for being on third floor to be away from the outside noises, though.

You'll be able to leave a reasonable amount in the trunk rooms (think a suitcase or two) assuming there's not much competition.  You may also be able to leave some things in your room in some of the cupboards—that's were I left plates and things like that (I also left posters up).

true,Kesuke,null,null,"When I went to university the first time in 2005 I found out about 3 weeks before going that I didn't have accomodation... Basically I got down there and lodged with an old couple for 2 weeks - but it was just a place to sleep. I was out most of the day with freshers activities/lectures/meeting people etc. I found 3 other people in the same boat and we went out and got a rented house at the end of that 2 weeks for the rest of the year - one of the best student houses I ever lived in (and I ended up living in ~6 between my two degrees).

It meant I *""missed""* the halls experience which at the time I was gutted about. I was at a city-based campus university so not being on campus felt like I was missing out on an institution... but I later came to realsie I hadn't missed anything at all. Well, no, thats a lie - what I missed was being extorted by a university into paying £50 a week extra for a shitty single room and a dirty shared kitched - with flatmates I may OR may not have gotten on with... for a sheltered student experience. As it was, doing it my way I still made great friends and had a brilliant time which was what mattered - and I did it for cheaper, in a much nicer house with a big double bed that was great for when my girlfriend (who was still at college) came down ;) and at the end of the day at virtually all universities students end up in the private sector after the first year - so I was a veteran of arranging a tenancy while my 1st year friends were still stressing about it.

&gt; Because the university has booked all the private accommodation, it's basically impossible to find any of your own 

* Nope, it just feels like it is. Heres what you need to do...

* Get looking on www.spareroom.co.uk (worth paying the £15 fee for) and gumtree, Glasgow is one of the biggest cities in the UK - don't be mislead into thinking the university has somehow stolen it all by block-booking 500 rooms. It isn't even a drop in the ocean to the rental sector. Live with other 1st years in the same boat, or worst case some second years. There will be lots of people this time of year looking for student flatmates (often because 1 person in a 4 person flatshare arranged back in februrary decides they actually don't want to go back to uni and leave the other 3 short).

&gt; Is there some sort of regulator I can complain to about this

* Maybe, but I wouldn't persue that line of thinking any further. This is unfortunately your first taste of university and adult life (and its happened before you've even arrived).

I'd be very surprised to see Holtby play, I'm not sure his midweek performance justifies playing the toughest fixture we have. But I could be wrong.

I think our biggest worry is Walcott on Rose, that goes without saying, and it's for this reason we may see 1 or these 2 changes:

Vertonghen at LB with Kaboul filling in. An obvious choice, though he may not be able to match the pace of Walcott.

Or, Dembele at a left sided midfielder role. Similar to how he played vs liverpool last season (and he was still our best player, though he was on the right), just to add physicality and more of a defensive approach than Chadli. But that's dependant on Sandro's fitness to fill in at CM (or we use Siggy/Holtby).


Another change I can foresee is, fitness dependant, Lennon playing. I feel he has more experience and better form against the arse, and hence will get the call up over Townsend. This is supported by the fact that Andros has started 3 games in a row... even Walker was subbed off vs Tblisi, presumably to maintain fitness for sunday.

Embrace time alone. Even if it's the odd afternoon. Listen to your favourite music or read a chapter of a book that has nothing to do with your degree.

Don't believe that anyone else has more of a grip on everything than yourself. Lots of people pretend to know what they're doing and believe themselves to be cool, or better or more interesting. They're not. 

Try to make a phonecall to someone you love every week.

Make time to do the things that you love to do now. If anyone gives you shit for doing the things you enjoy, lose them.

Only go to the parties that you really want to go to, with the people that you really like.

Visit the seaside. It makes you feel good and it isn't far away, even if it feels like it.

Don't beat yourself up when you have your inevitable early twenties brake-down. Everyone has one and you'll get through it. Try to be there for your friends when they have theirs.

You may not know them forever, but your friends will be the most important aspect of your life for a while. Give them hugs and tell them that you love them.

Even though the troubles were effectively over, to see an armoured personnel carrier at Larne docks was a surprise and seeing all police armed didn't sit well. I remember stopping at the border. There was a RUC officer, a Garda officer and me, a former soldier all stood there having a chat and the RUC officer said he couldn't have imagined 10 years ago this happening. 

Driving through bandit country from Londonderry there was some really nasty anti-British stuff painted on the road. Oh and there didn't seem to be many petrol stations in Londonderry, the reason for which I found later that day as I went over the border to see four petrol stations right next to each other literally a few hundred yards past the border selling fuel infinitely cheaper than the UK.

Met some Irish lasses at a choke and puke in a layby on the way to Londonderry and had a chat for half an hour whilst I had a break.

Neither does having Dembele at LW. He's got great defensive tools in his box, but arguably not the right set for Walcott. He'd be far better off in CM. I'd rather have a winger at LW, be it Chadli or Townsend.

Otherwise, I share your consern about Rose. I like him, but I'm not sure he's ready for Walcott just yet. I think we'll look like this, assuming 4-3-3:  


Lloris 

Walker - Dawson/Kaboul - Super Jan - Rose 

Capoue - Dembele 

Paulinho 

Lennon - Soldado - Chadli/Townsend

Lloris 

Walker - Dawson/Kaboul - Super Jan - Rose 

Capoue - Paulinho 

Lennon - Holtby - Chadli/Townsend 

Soldado 
 
 
 
I think Capoue has been incredible since he joined and deserves the start. He was rested against Dinamo Tblisi as well, and Sandro isn't necessarily ready for a start against a top team again yet. I also think AVB will pick Paulinho over Dembele at this stage. Dembele hasn't foundnd his form so far this season.

true,EnglishNumpty,cnty-england,England,"&gt;More to the point, your terminology indicates that you think that immmigrants, illegal immigrants and asylum seekers are the same thing.

Asylum seekers (most of whom aren't really refugees to begin with) and any immigrant without a visa are the same to me. They're here without permission and they're not doing society any good.

I'd happily round them up in some crowded prison. We could build it on the Indian Ocean Territory, or somewhere in Scotland.

&gt;Immigrants, that come here to work and pay taxes are a good thing. (Thankfully) We, as a nation, have a legal duty to protect people who come here seeking asylum.

They aren't. The sheer number has driven wages down and corrupted society. Crime has shot up too as a direct result of immigration.

One option is to change the law to ban asylum seekers who travel through other countries on their way here. The point in that agreement was for neighbouring countries to take refugees, so places like Ethiopia should take Somali refugees, it isn't supposed to be a free ticket for Somalis to go wherever they want.

The second option is to ban people getting British citizenship unless they have a British parent, that should stop half these people getting permanent residency on the basis that they popped out a child on our islands.

&gt;We do not have a ""virtually open door immigration policy.""

Go to Birmingham or London and tell me there isn't too much immigration. Immigrants are a majority in these places. Mohammed is the second most popular name for children now.

Pretty much anyone can turn up from Africa or Asia if they claim they're asylum seekers. If they're successful they get a council house and a selection of welfare benefits to choose from.

&gt;And that is just my anecdotal experience...

In my experience all the quality immigrants from America, Canada, Australia, etc. are penalised while the bad immigrants from third world countries are allowed in. So I agree that it's not an open door to the world, but there's an open window to the left of the door that's exploited by thousands of people each week.

true,Chimera2402,null,null,"You're not wrong, a lot of what we do could be done by most people in much the same way that a lot of what a soldier/paramedic/police officer does could be with similar training to various degrees. Each of those professions certainly face their own (and often more undoubtedly) dangers than a firefighter but the analogy holds that it's only when things really go wrong does the individual really need to be skilled in their profession. For the Fire service this may be less often but regardless of how often we're needed when it does really hit the fan you need people who are highly trained in whatever the incident may be. The Fire service does get looked upon as having a very small easy to maintain skills set when its far from it. The average firefighter is trained in the following;

- Firefighting - Naturally, but this involves having to be able to fully search beyond doubt any building completely blindfolded in a team of 2 whilst the building may or may not be hotter than an oven in fire kit and breathing apparatus that will ""protect you"" for up to 8 seconds whilst completely engulfed in fire (and thus allows no heat to escape) 
- Water Rescue
- Animal Rescue
- Hazmat Jobs including decontamination, mass decontamination of the public, gas tight suit wearing etc. etc.
- Working at height rescues 
- Road Traffic Collisions
- Emergency First Aid
- Endless different scenario's of where fire might occur, Silo fire? Entire own set of procedures, Basement fire? Have some new procedures, Chimney fires? Boat Fires? Forest Fires? etc. etc. 

A lot of time and effort is put into maintaining our competencies, time that was once put into going out of the doors to jobs has now become simply time to drill and train to make sure that when we do need those skills someone doesn't die like has unfortunately happened to more than a few fire-fighters in recent years. 

The fitness issue gets murky as well, the average person might be able to pass the current fitness tests (Which are being made harder with strength based components by the brigades, not the government which is why the government say ""we've no intention on raising fitness tests"" because it's not them doing it) which are based on VO2/max but the older you get the worse your body deals with excess heat (And believe me, within 30 seconds of putting the fire kit on that we wear for every type of job we go to you're dealing with getting too warm unless it's the peak of winter) and more importantly strength fades, our equipment is heavy, our fire kit and breathing aparatus wears 25kg alone now imagine trying to drag an 80kg unconscious person out of a building up and down stairs whilst slowly cooking. 


Claims we lose the lot are disingenuous dependent on the circumstance, I agree. Part of the governments final offer was that should we go at 55 we'd get the pension at 55 and just take a 21% hit to the total which was more than fair in my opinion as you're taking it early and paying in for less time, the figures of the offer on the table currently are much worse I believe. The claim we lose the lot is hyperbolic of the fact that should a firefighter develop a bad back at 53 and be unable to maintain operational fitness that he A) Gets sacked on competence and B) Has his inflation frozen until **National Pension age, not 60** so effectively he is without a job to support himself and doesn't receive his pension until 8 years after he should have gotten it (68 instead of 60). I should imagine what would be fair would be similar to the Govs. final offer (In this aspect only) on actuary reduction but with the option to go from 50 with an agreed fair reduction meaning there's no chance of, particularly women en mass, being without pension nor career or up to 18 years aged 50-68.

My comments on inflation linking were just to emphasise the amount being lost, inflation linking is not really part of the argument and I should have been more clear on that matter.

Some men can (33% passed 55 if the brigade puts more emphasis on personal training and recruited at a higher level. It hasn't and it didn't. Based on the governments own big study), women will be very unlikely to make it to or passed 55 due to the high strength requirement of our job. I personally think it could be done with people are a new in an young now but the ship has sailed for the vast majority currently in. 

With the progression part in my brigade (which is fairly representative) there's 330ish operational Firefighters. The operational officer line (who all still have to pass the same fitness test currently, though that'll probably change when the strength components come in) is 40 strong. This is in part why the governments ""they can find other roles in the service"" strategy doesn't work due to the fact the fire service is very front line heavy with not even a fraction of the needed ""other"" jobs there for too old operational Firefighters to fill.

 I think perhaps we should play a 4-4-1-1 with Whittaker in for Martin and Olsson for Garrido although we run the risk that these full backs are very attacking. I feel that the midfield should not include Johnson today as his passing has been really off these last few games, and he has struggled to add anything to our squad. Fer and Tettey do well together and I feel they ought to start. Redmond and Snodgrass on the flanks will be expected and probably the best choice for us. Then the front two? A striker with someone sitting behind them, possibly Wes or another forward player would be my choice. Elmander should go up top given his target man style of play, but got really involved in the midfield unlike Ricky, so he could always play the Wes role. Ricky might be a waste playing further towards the midfield as he is more of a poacher. Chris Hughton has certainly got a tough decision on his hands today!

Whatever happens, I hope to see some nice football, clean passes and a fair few goals (all Norwich's I hope). I could also do with Snodgrass scoring a couple to boost my fantasy football team...

&gt; [This is a profound psychological violence here. How can one even begin to speak of dignity in labour when one secretly feels one’s job should not exist? How can it not create a sense of deep rage and resentment. **Yet it is the peculiar genius of our society that its rulers have figured out a way, as in the case of the fish-fryers, to ensure that rage is directed precisely against those who actually do get to do meaningful work.** For instance: in our society, there seems a general rule that, the more obviously one’s work benefits other people, the less one is likely to be paid for it.  Again, an objective measure is hard to find, but one easy way to get a sense is to ask: what would happen were this entire class of people to simply disappear? Say what you like about nurses, garbage collectors, or mechanics, it’s obvious that were they to vanish in a puff of smoke, the results would be immediate and catastrophic. A world without teachers or dock-workers would soon be in trouble, and even one without science fiction writers or ska musicians would clearly be a lesser place. It’s not entirely clear how humanity would suffer were all private equity CEOs, lobbyists, PR researchers, actuaries, telemarketers, bailiffs or legal consultants to similarly vanish. (Many suspect it might markedly improve.)

Apart from their 'offside' goal on 10 minutes they've not really troubled us at all, but the same can be said for us. We've had 5 or 6 corners and not one of them was even close to a chance. However, our play defensively and in possession has been very encouraging.

Noel Hunt has not been having a good game though. He's found himself in good positions at times but his poor control, bad touch or disappointing end product has resulted in us losing possession. I know it's difficult on TV to actually see the greater game (closing down, movement, space creating, etc) but on the evidence from the TV, I would take Hunt off and bring on Poleon to try and stretch the game. But then, Poleon doesnt work nearly half as hard as hunt and thus we cant rely upon him to win those balls higher up the pitch.

As long as we continue in this vein I think we'll get a couple of chances and I'd have confidence in both Varney and Mccormack to finish off one of those in the form their in.

They followed conventional military strategy to gas as many people as possible - first shelling the area, then dropping chemical weapons, then waiting until that had settled and dropping **more chemical weapons** to inflict double the damage. Once that gas cleared, Assad's forces retook that ground. 

This was not a case of rebels just letting off a few canisters. It was a properly timed, planned, and executed operation, that went far beyond the capabilities of the rebels in many different ways. 

Further to this there has been another 6 instances reported since 2012 when chemical weapons have been used. These were quite minor, and I suspect that the rebels may well have had a hand in those. But let's put this conspiracy bullshit to bed. If the rebels had the power to use chemical weapons in that way, why would they use it on themselves based on the vague promise of some minor air support from the US? If they had these capabilities they could equally be using them against civilians and military targets on Assad's side. It would significantly swing the war in their favour. 

But what about people within Assad's government doing it without his knowledge? Does that really matter... No. Even if his dog pressed the switch that released the nerve agents, those chemical weapons are unsecured and need to be stopped.

Given that the GUU extension building (where they used to host their thursday clubnight) is getting replaced this year there will probably be more events going on in the city centre anyway, as thats where the majority of the student centred clubs are, as well as the Strathclyde University Union, which was always nicer than either the GUU or the QMU.

What private halls have they offered you? If you are worried on missing out, bear in mind that you will still be with a large group of students, united in being fucked over by this circumstance; That if you are in the city centre you will be near the other two universities in Glasgow and their students; You will also be near the majority of Glasgow's nightlife; and that the other halls are slightly more convenient for Glasgow uni, but much less convenient for everything else in Glasgow, all you are really missing at the moment is the minibus.

Finally, as students drop out throughout the year, there's a chance you'll be able to put in for a transfer to the other halls without violating your lease etc.

Glasgow is a great city and UofG is a great Uni. Most of the people you meet are friendly and helpful. Just remember that both of these institutions are, unfortunately run by face-saving, barely competent eijits. That will probably be the same no matter where you go.",0,1377953016,null,0,1377955634,0,cbyzuiu,t3_1lepjj,t1_cbyzuiu,t1_cbyq4j4,null,1429637343,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,cstross,null,null,"If coming from the USA, you'll almost certainly arrive on a red-eye overnight flight. Meaning you will be jet-lagged as hell -- you'll have 4-8 hours missing from your night!

You'll then have to get from the airport (probably the festering circle of hell that is Heathrow, or the mere purgatory that is Gatwick) to King's Cross (if taking the East Coast Main Line). Good luck with that; assuming Heathrow, then after dealing with Immigration and Customs (allow at least an hour -- this may be optimistic) you can either pay through the nose for the Heathrow Express (the world's most expensive railway per mile travelled, around £20, takes about 15 minutes) then change onto the tube at Paddington, or get the Piccadilly line from Heathrow (about 90 minutes). 

Don't even *think* about getting a taxi -- LGW or LHR to KX will set you back something in the range £80-150 and take a couple of hours.

Here's a hint: unless your flight arrives before 10am you are cutting things awfully tight to make a 2pm train from King's Cross. If your flight arrives after 11am, I'd recommend trying to rebook a seat on a later train because you'll probably miss your connection. Remember you're going to be dealing with foreign Immigration authorities at peak time, then grappling with a foreign public transport system while jet-lagged -- a system which takes about 60 minutes at the best of times (if you pay extra for the Heathrow Express *and* know how to use the Tube network) and maybe 2 hours (if you rely on the tube and have to spend 15 minutes puzzling out your connections).

Once on the train, assuming you reserved a seat, the journey takes 4.5-5 hours. Yes, there is countryside to see. You will probably be asleep, though, or in an altered state of consciousness. There is wifi on board (at a price, unless you're paying for a first class seat). There's a place to buy hot foot. Be warned, food on board British trains is a bit crap and a bit over-priced.

You'd have done a lot better to have flown to New York, then caught the (direct) United flight from Newark to Edinburgh. Smaller airport, less of a queue at Immigration/Customs, and a 30 minute bus ride from the airport to the city centre for about £5.

I think we made the decision to bring both Smith and Poleon on too early. We suddenly lost all that possession we had in the first half and our grip on the game suddenly shifted. We started playing hoof ball and the game became more broken. There was more space on the wings and Warnock was found wanting a number of times.

I thought Green played very well in the middle of the pitch. I didnt see him do anything wrong and was both very assured in possession and extremely dilligent in defence. 

Also, Wooton and Pearce look like an extremely solid pairing. The danger came from the flanks which I put down to the lack of the hard working Varney/Hunt.

I would have loved a draw but I'm not too upset we lost one nothing from a set piece place.

My wish for the next game. Better set-piece delivery. It was fucking terrible today. Warnock must have had a dozen chances from various corners and free-kicks and we did absolutely nothing with them. Yet, QPR looked a threat from every single one they had. It's a big difference in this league.

I'm not too disappointed. We looked stable for the first half and if we can take that into the next game and add a bit of quality on those final balls we'll not be too far away at the end of the season.

true,Awittysaying,null,null,"I worked in my university accommodation office after graduating. It is fairly standard practice to over subscribe on student accommodation and double up rooms. So many people drop out within the first week or simply fail to turn up, that the university can move people into single rooms within a few weeks. 

The problem with going through clearing is that you end up at the bottom of the list for accommodation. Your best options are either stick it out for a few weeks and wait for some rooms to be freed up and keep pestering your accommodation department for a room transfer. Or you can search local forums and contact the students union and try and find a spare room in a house with older students. As it is quite likely there are students who've dropped out just before returning to uni and left an empty room in a hose share. 

Universities make no money from empty rooms so there is a huge incentive to oversubscribed to cope with the no shows and drop outs. Accommodation services tend to run on a first come first served basis and you need to be as flexible as possible. The person willing to take anything and who goes into the accommodation office everyday will be given the first room that frees up. 

I wouldn't worry about who you live with or where in your first year. You'll most likely forget a lot of the people you meet in the first few months. I had several friends who had to share rooms at the start of the year and they really didn't miss out on anything, in fact they ended up with wider social circles because they lived in 2 different halls complexes. 

For the first month at least you really shouldn't be spending much time in your room , look at this as an opportunity to spend a lot of time learning the city and trying out different clubs. For now your room is just somewhere to sleep and if you keep talking to the accommodation staff you'll get moved in no time. Just remember to be nice and polite, I always went the extra mile for a student who minded their manners. 

Seriously this will only ruin your uni experience if you let it. I say take the room and as soon as you get there go in person to the accommodation department and ask for a room transfer. 

Key points go in person, be polite, don't be picky, go everyday, and most importantly of all be persistent not aggressive. Manners and polite persistence will get you at the top of the list. Also get there first thing, seriously unpack then go immediately to the accommodation office. It should be the first thing you do. 

Think of this as a little road bump and this time next year you'll have a story about how you played the system and got yourself a new room. It might not seem like it but learning to deal with a situation like this will teach you some really valuable life lessons.

I'm only a little bit older than you myself but have been living here for about 9 years (about to actually leave for uni). I work in a shop over here and the number of English people here is extra-ordinarily high! You may get a few comments about your accent, but the vast majority of people will be as friendly as possible to you! One thing that I find very different, and I noticed especially when I visited Bournmouth two years ago, is that everyone will say hello or acknowledge you as you walk, even if it's just a ""Hello"" or some even stop and have a chat, whereas in some parts of England, it's almost like you don't exist!

On the religion thing, it is a big thing here! I myself am an atheist and the majority of people don't care, but do be aware that almost everyone goes to church, and almost everyone knows your beliefs and that will shape their opinion on you in many cases. Watch out for some extreme beliefs too!

The other point I'd mention, mainly on politics, is that the political spectrum doesn't exist here as you know it. People aren't left wing or right wing (in general, obviously there are exceptions), it's mainly based on Protestant or Unionist. Ballymena is what I'd call a right-winged town, but also a mainly Unionist one. Ultimately it doesn't mean a thing, but that's the way it is here!

But really, it's a beautiful part of the world, especially to get out and explore! Someone mentioned the North Coast and it really has everything to offer! The spectacular scenery for one thing! But around the summer time there are numerous attractions, the annual North West 200 motorcycle Road Race goes through Coleraine, Portstewart and Portrush (about a half hour drive away) and is spectacular. In July there's the annual youth football tournament, The Milk Cup, which sees some of the best academies in the world, ranging from Premier League teams like Liverpool &amp; Manchest United, to some huge world names, like Corinthians and Barcelona who came one year, this actually has a couple of games in Ballymena too! And Portrush also hosts the annual Air Show, actually on as I type! One suggestion for when you do move too, go to Portstewart, buy a Morelli's ice cream and take a walk around the coast-line, really, really worth it!

true,TomShoe,1972crest,,"After the Newcastle game, pretty much every recap lead with something about whether Newcastle's incompetence was the deciding factor, or City's brilliance. I think after our last two games we can be pretty sure of the answer to that question.  Not that it's a very big deal. Six points from three games isn't bad, and a slow start to the season is entirely understandable given the circumstances. The players have to adapt to a new coach, and a new style, and the coach has to adapt that style to a new team and perhaps more importantly, a new league. 

Pellegrini is clearly still adapting to England and the premier league. It's easy to be underwhelmed by the way he's handled the team so far—we haven't really played the beautiful, dominant football we were told to expect, but he's still adapting to the opposition. Managing a premier league side has a pretty steep learning curve, and it will take a while for him to climb it. He doesn't yet have a clear idea what to expect from other teams, or how best to deal with it. 

No two ways about it, we were outplayed tactically in the first half and it seemed to take that first 45 minutes for him to figure out what needed to happen, and get his act together. We were lucky to go into halftime even, but we looked pretty good in the second half, and while Hull continued to play well, I don't think the goals were against the run of play, although I definitely wouldn't call this a great win. 

That said, I think as he gets more familiar with the league, we'll start to see why he's earned the reputation he has. It shouldn't be too difficult to get his free flowing brand of football out of this squad, but it won't be easy either—it'll take time and familiarity with the league, which are things he can't be expected to have right off that bat. In the meantime it'll be a matter of grinding out results like these, which is something a league winning side needs to be able to do. 

Last year I often found myself taking solace in that fact that we were able grind out wins like this after unconvincing performances, but after a while it started to seem like whenever we won, it was by grinding out an undeserved three points. I think a lot of that had to do with complacency, and it's not unsurprising that many of our worst performances last year, not just defensively, but all around, coincided with Kompany's absences. Having the captain around is crucial for the attitude of the team. I noticed last year that without him, many of the other players didn't seem to have the same fight, the same hunger for victory. I think some of this may have been due to animosity with Mancini as well, but it always seemed worse when Kompany was gone. Now far be it from me to speak ill of Mancini, I loved the guy, but the attitude of the team in the later half of last season, whoever's fault it was, sucked, and it will take time to shake, especially with the Captain out. 

That's gonna make it hard for Pellegrini to get the best out of the team in these early fixtures, and it's not surprising that we haven't really looked the part so far—these first few games were never going to be easy. But I have every confidence that once we get into the swing of things we'll be seeing much better quality from the team,

You've pretty much confirmed what my research was turning up: taxi = bad idea; timing of flights and connections. My flight arrives at (I hope) 9am, and I knew the immigration/baggage/connection thing would be if not tight, then interesting. My plan was to take the Piccadilly line, which I was basing off of the time on some current time-table I found somewhere.

I have a one hour buffer window I built into this at the 11am mark, under the assumption that Murphy would take over, and my baggage would be late, or Customs a pain. There was a Piccadilly line at noon as well, but that would make the switch at Kings Cross even tighter. I really hope it doesn't come to that.

As for why I didn't fly into EDI, it had to do with a boatload of airmiles that someone gave me, and a balancing of costs. Poor student here!

I do have a reserved seat on the LDN to EDI train, and yah, I'll be traveling for close to 24+ hours. Can I cross these experiences off my bucket list now??

                    Sturridge        Suarez

Basically the appeal of this formation is that it allows our best players; Suarez, Sturridge and Coutinho to all play in their best positions at the same time. However one massive flaw is the midfield of Lucas and Gerrard, for a 3 back I'd really think we'd need 1, if not 2, energetic box to box midfielders. Take Juve as an example, Vidal and Marchisio can more than provide a attack threat as well as defend - and ultimately provide work rate and energy needed to accompany Pirlo. I don't believe either Lucas and Gerrard would be able to do this specific job. 

However, for the purpose of a hypothetical discussion let's presume they can. I chosen to go with the 3 back for a number of reasons:

1. I'm a bit of a wild ride.
1. Rodgers has mentions a number of times that the 3-5-2 is his favourite formation.
1. We lack any natural wingers of superb quality, sure we have Sterling and Ibe who may be able to do a job for part of the season but rely on them we can not.
1. This is the first time in Rodgers' campaign that he's had 3 centre backs whom he can trust - or at least I presume so. ",0,1377969935,null,0,false,0,cbz3yyl,t3_1lgtj4,t1_cbz3yyl,t3_1lgtj4,null,1429635408,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7

Being overly boastful is often seen as a negative personality trait in the UK - though you will probably get some leeway for being American. (This isn't meant to sound insulting, honest.)

They will indeed go through your CV, they will probably ask you some questions along the lines of ""Describe a situation from a previous job where *something relevant* happened."" The idea is to demonstrate a talent that would be useful in the new job.

Unless Immigration fuck you up completely, or there's an outage on the Piccadilly line, you should be able to make your connection.

Contingency plans: *just in case* those things go wrong, I would advise you to identify a cheap hotel near King's Cross (a Travelodge or similar) that you can divert to and crash in overnight if you're too late to buy a replacement train ticket for travel later the same day.

When travelling, preparation is everything ...

One other emergency travel option if you miss your train: the Scotrail Sleeper train runs overnight from Euston, not King's Cross (it's about half a mile up the road, an easy walk). It leaves around 11pm and reaches Edinburgh at 7am. You won't be able to get a sleeper berth at short notice but they may be able to sell you a seated second class ticket as a walk-up.

They all had the performance numbers to back this up; the first three had fantastic crossing and accuracy stats whilst Carroll's heading ability was plain to see. Add Gerrard into the mix and you have a midfield lined up to provide crosses into the box for Carroll to feed on.

There were, as I see it, two problems with this.

First, and most obvious, was that we massively over-paid for the Dalglish plan and he himself alluded to that being down to Comolli.

Secondly, we bought Suarez, who never fit into Dalglish's apparent plan of 442 with a Fowler/judas-type of player playing alongside Carroll.


It's my opinion that Dalglish and Comolli had different views as to how the team should be set up and this may have led to Comolli not pushing for the right prices on players that he didn't want to buy. There was a power struggle, with each believing themselves to be more important than the other and this cost the club pretty dearly.
The possible evidence of this can be seen now with the transfer committee that's been created so as to provide over-sight on all dealings.

If Sandro/dembele could go forever than spurs wouldn't have been in a position that required Bale, we were comfortably third pre-Sandro injury before any Bale heroics

That cover has been brought in via Paulinho/Capoue and the outgoing of Gallas has also been covered. On top of that other issues such as wing depth, creativity in the final third and a class striker have all been addressed. Spurs have weakened in one area, but strengthened in many others. Once the players learn each other the increase in quality will mean the team shouldn't be even getting into positions that require Bale heroics.

&gt;They aren't. The sheer number has driven wages down and corrupted society. Crime has shot up too as a direct result of immigration.

Source for any of that? [This study](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/apr/28/immigration-impact-crime) showed quite different findings. And the argument for wages being pushed down by immigrants is [not solid](http://fullfact.org/factchecks/immigration_jobs_wages-28674).

I live in London. Not too much immigration here for me. Immigrants are not the [majority in London] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_London#2011_Census) Muhammed is the [19th most popular name for children in 2012](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/aug/12/top-100-baby-names-2012-girls-boys-list).

Anyone can turn up for anywhere and claim asylum. That is the point of the system. I would rather have a few blaggers and help those that need it.

Surprised at how poor West Ham looked and how different Stoke were as a team compared to their first game against us in GW1.

I'm more baffled by City though, I mean if you look at their squad, they should be destroying teams like Hull? I know its early doors and Pellegrini will need time with the squad but they looked unfit, clueless and just genuinely poor earlier today.

On a side note I actually can't wait for the game tomorrow, so excited!

true,[deleted],null,null,"One of my best experiences in a pub was when I moved up to London for university, I was getting relatively home sick and the 6 nations were just about to start. I hadn't made masses of friends who enjoyed rugby and didn't know any other Welsh people but a friend recommended a pub in West Kensington that was meant to be a good place to be a Wales supporter in London.

I rather nervously hopped on the train and then the tube and as I looked up I noticed many people on the carriage wearing red tops and scarfs. As I got off the tube and turned left I noticed a lot of Welsh fans walking in one direction and I kind of followed. I grabbed a pint and sat at a table on my own and watched the pre-match commentary for about thirty minutes before a couple of people asked if they could share the table and I agreed. We chatted and enjoyed a round between us. The pub was full of Welsh rugby fans and I'd never met any of them before and they made me feel like I belonged there. 

After weeks of not really knowing what I thought of London, university and whether I'd get used to not living in a small Welsh town where I know everyone, I felt part of something.  A short tube ride away from my new home. It made me realise there is something for everyone in London and you just need to know where to look. 

I returned to the Famous Three Kings to enjoy one of the most atmospheric rugby pubs in London for the duration of the six nations.

true,AloysiusC,null,null,"&gt;A huge majority of politicians on this planet are men.

Irrelevant. In a democracy the source of power lies with with the voters and to some extent lobbyists. In the case of voters women have marginally more since they're the majority of the electorate. In the case of lobby support they hands down win over men. 


For a group to have political representation it is not necessary that the person doing the representing is a member of that group. In fact it is SEXIST for you to assume that men being the majority of politicians necessarily implies women being less well represented. You can only arrive at that conclusion if you believe men are inherently unable to represent women sufficiently. Fortunately most women aren't sexists like you and clearly vote for politicians according to their policies and not their genitalia. 
See how your feminist worldview requires and promotes an adversarial sexist mindset? If you really didn't care about what people had between their legs, you also wouldn't care what politicians have between their legs. 

There's more evidence when you look at the actual policies made exclusively for women vs those exclusively for men. Women as a group are constantly being represented exclusively and men virtually never. When was the last time you heard a politician of any significance openly and intentionally stand up for the interests of men as a group? Women all the time. This point alone even without everything else exemplifies which gender holds the reigns in society.

My point essentially is that you can argue that socialist theory will make everyone happy and wealthy, and indeed under the right circumstances I don't disagree.

true,Streetrip,null,null,"Hey guys,

I'm actually one of the event organisers for this. It's part of the Campus Party event overall and there is no additional entry fee beyond the general entry for the event (seriously, no additional entry beyond). You can register on the day or on the web page.

Apologies for the lack of information on the page itself proper, Campus Party itself is actually a tech event and not a gaming tournament but as one of the organisers, I couldn't help myself but lobby to put a strong gaming presence in there.

First day of tournament play begins on 3rd September and the grand finals begin on 5th September with room to roll over to the next day. I understand not everyone can pull huge nights so that's why we can't put it all in one big block.

Short notice sucks too, HUGE apologies about that but it was a bit of a faff with trying to lobby for a Dota 2 tournament itself with a prize fund.

We're not looking to make a profit on this at all, check out the event, it's got bucket loads of content. Once I knew the details, as one of the organisers I thought it was a great opportunity to expand the Dota 2 scene in the UK because I know we have loads of players, but not enough tournaments with a low barrier to entry. So this is my way of chipping in as a huge Dota 2 fan based in the UK myself.

Some of the community here has already been in touch with me, I've done my best to address their Qs and the most frequently asked Qs I've put the answers on to the page itself.

Now of note for those interested in participating. The week passes are now sold out. The allocation has been reached but there are day passes for all four days still available. We can't shift our allocations of tickets to make room for more week passes because then we incur the wrath of fire regulations and all that jazz. I don't know the particulars themselves but when I tried to get some week passes sorted for a team who wanted to come, I hit a brick wall.

On a personal note, working with the other organisers, this is going to be a tremendous event for anyone with an interest in tech of all forms. We've got some great speakers and activities. There are 3 other competitions being run, one other 5v5 week long and two which have prizes daily. So even if you win or runner up in one of those, you'll earn the price of your ticket back and have hours of content to go through.

Even if you don't have a full team, I highly recommend turning up. The atmosphere of past Campus Party events have been super social and really exciting. Day passes are £15 and for what's on offer, it's honestly an outrageous bargain and heavily subsidised by Telefónica | O2 and our other generous partners.

We don't have casters, or are live streaming this, so no pressure. Also it lets me save up to put in over £3k in prize fund and I think that's what people are more excited about. We've got about three complete teams when I last checked the registration and many more partial teams. But slots are prioritized on full teams entering. Also very importantly: ANYONE CAN ENTER! If your team is completely full of feeders, I'm sure your opponents will love you but also there'll be people to give you first hand tips and comment on the replays which we'll be running on our projector screens.

Any Qs, I'll be checking back on reddit when I can but I'm going on site tomorrow so not sure how much I can get back to you guys. Post away though and good luck! Here's the link to the tournament page:

I'm one of the organisers for this so any Qs, post away and I'll do my best to answer it (I'm going on site tomorrow so responses may be limited).

First: MASSIVE apologies for short notice, it was a faff lobbying to even have a Dota 2 tournament (VALVe aren't sponsoring us) but some tenacity pulled through.

We also don't have casters or livestreaming. Yes, I know. Less glamorous but I didn't want to eat into the prize pool as I think that's far more important for gamers.

Entry is at no additional cost to the tickets to the event (although week passes are sold out. Sorry about that [fire regulations] but I can't be too upset about the event selling out lol). Day tickets are available at £15 a pop.

The systems are desktops not laptops. They're provided to us from Scan Hardware. Really good guys helping us to make this possible.

So yeah. Highly recommend (of course I'm biased but check out the page for some additional biased evidence haha). Get registered. UK Dota has tons of players but the scene doesn't reflect the size so as a fan myself, this was my way of chipping in to the solution of getting Dota 2 bigger here.

For more info, check out my posts. I created this account because reddit community members have already been in touch with me to find out more and I've added the answers their most frequently asked Qs onto the site page. If there's more, I'll make on the fly edits.

Hope you all enjoy and good luck!",0,1377983555,null,0,false,0,cbz830u,t3_1l6xen,t1_cbz830u,t3_1l6xen,null,1429633488,2,false,UKDota,t5_2uyoj,2

Jobs are fairly easy to get in the UK, providing that u have experience, so it may be worthwhile if you have some volunteering experience or say that u worked somewhere to your employers. Of course they would! Its hardly manual labour, you don't have to be confined to working at a supermarket, look at government websites, local newspapers, sign up to the job centre etc.

It seems that you are in a tricky position in regards to jobs because I come from the South East of England and they have quite a few jobs going around and I'm been told that the economic situation in ireland isnt exactly brilliant. So if you could find a job in ireland to save u from renting then I would take the year out in your home but if finding a job is literally unfeasible then perhaps if u got someone you know you could stay there or if not, just look around that offers cheap rent such as cardiff or anywhere thats not london and find a job that pays reasonably well there.",0,1377984339,null,0,false,0,cbz8b3g,t3_1lh2jn,t1_cbz8b3g,t1_cbz816t,null,1429633383,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

You own yourself. If someone, say, drafts you to fight in a war, attacks you with a knife, etc. that is an infringement on your basic human rights. This isn't to say that this ownership can't or shouldn't be violated depending on the circumstances, but again that loops back around to consequentialism, which is unrelated to the immediate point.

You exist in time. Your past, your present, and your future. Your future is your life. If I kill or cripple you, I deprive you of your future. Your present is your liberty -- the right to spend your time doing as you please. If I put you in a labor camp for the day, I am depriving you of your present. Your past is your property -- if I steal a birdhouse that you've made from scratch, I'm depriving you of the part of your past that you used to produce it.

The justification for personal property is identical to that of private property.

Yes. 

&gt;What about the fact that private property deprives others of their own liberty? Positive liberty exists as well as Negative liberty.

Positive liberty does not exist (although what it seeks to provide can be pursued through consequentialism). In isolation, obviously positive liberty ceases to exist. It is not an innate right. If there is no food anywhere there is no food anywhere, no matter how badly you and others think you are entitled to it. As such, people don't have positive liberty. Furthermore, a group of people cannot come together and grant themselves rights over others that they did not already have. Now, they can do it anyway but again that returns us to consequentialism.

Every day, the whole floor gathers around and a team manager reels off the stats from the previous day's sales. After each team's stats are read out, everyone applauds. He/she tells a few anecdotes and gives a speech. The speech is different day today, dependent on who gives them. Some managers will include such shit as ""we at STP (Scam the Public) stick together. We're a family. You're my brothers and sisters and I love you. Today I want us to hit our targets early so that we can get out of here and enjoy the nice weather, lets get on the phones!!"" After this there's some whooping, applause and back-slapping.

All demonstrably bullshit but people are indoctrinated.

Let me tell you a story about a guy who's name is Dave for the purpose of narrative. Dave is basically what I'd describe as a grinning, brain-dead moron. He had a load of tattoos and was basically a big daft chav in a suit. Dave got a tattoo of the company logo. Why? Because co-workers said “I bet you won't..” Well I found out from the only actual friend I made in that place that Dave made a sale one day, which was found to have a 'critical fail'. Basically, he broke Ministry of Justice rules. Dave angrily insisted that he didn't. A manager was heard to say ""He's negging out, get him out of here."" Just like that, he lost his job.



Now I only know this because my mate told me. I deliberately only made one friend there because I knew instinctively that I couldn't trust anyone. Here's what happened to him. After I left he went from the training team onto a permanent team. The way it works is that if you don't hit your target by the end of the day on friday, you come in, unpaid, on Saturday. If you still don't hit target you're back Sunday too. This was a Saturday and my mate was stressed. He was already on Beta-Blockers (at age 21) for high blood pressure and anxiety attacks. His manager, this big meat-head asian lad, was piling the pressure on him to get sales when his heart started racing. He knew he had to get to hospital soon so he went to his manager and explained the situation ""I'm on these drugs that control my heart rate and they're failing, I need to go to hospital"". His manager said, and I'm not making this up, ""Nah bruv, you're here to make sales"" and ""are you sure you weren't just out sniffing something last night?""

He went up to another manager and said the same thing and was told to prove it. He hands her his pills. She tells him to ring his doctor on speakerphone or she won't believe him. When NHS direct said ""why the hell are you keeping him there?"" they said ""ok, but you're going to have to make it up tomorrow"".


They sacked him shortly after for ""taking illegal drugs"" on hear-say from another member of staff who had over-heard him say ""I'm off out tonight to get twisted"".

true,IntellegentIdiot,flair5,,"Sadly since he left, a lot of fans have enganged in some historical revisionism or attempt to downplay what BMJ acheived. Before the revolution of the summer of 04 we were shocking. Spurs fans talk about klinsmans second season or when ramos lost a few games but the 03-04 season was the only time I've been worried about relegation, we were late bad. Everyone was biding their time until the end of the season when club had confirmed a new manager would be appointed. It wasn't just that season though, for about 15 years Spurs had been stuck in mid-table, the prevailing attitude was we were happy as long as we were playing good football, which we were at times. We hadn't finished in the european places since the premiership had begun and it looked as hard then as finishing in the top 4 has looked in recent years.

The Jol years were a breath of fresh air. Firstly we were winning games all the time but not only that we were blowing teams away. We were winning games 5-0 with wingers that were so fast it was breathtaking. Had Jol been in charge from the start of the season, we would have finished 4th, pretty good for a team that finished in the bottom half of he table the season before. We finished 7th but followed up with a 5th place finish, cruelly denied on the last day, and then 5th again. It was disappointing but with the players we had it was still a fairly good result.

Sacking Martin Jol was one of the worst mistakes Levy made. Ultimately as fans we can't say what role Jol played in our success in that period. Perhaps he wanted to sign awful players but was overruled by Damien Commoli and/or Levy. I for one was happy that he joined Fulham, I think they made the right choice. There's not a lot any manager can do with Fulham, the best they can hope for is getting into the Europa League and perhaps doing well in the League Cup, unless the owner wants to spend big money.",0,1377987688,null,0,false,0,cbz9a72,t3_1lh088,t1_cbz9a72,t3_1lh088,null,1429632929,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3
