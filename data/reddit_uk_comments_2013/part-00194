true,samw11,null,null,"I moved to a new area for work and had similar issues some years back. I went to the pub once a week for karaoke night, I sat by the bar had 2 drinks and sang the same song. I quickly became a 'regular' and made friends with other locals and the staff - I even ended up working there as a second job one night a week. I'm still in touch with the DJ must be 15 years since I moved away again.

I have to second the 'get a dog' one, because I know so many people that I met walking the dog, but it is unfair if you are at work all day - but if you have a neighbour with a dog, ask if you can walk it occasionally. Most people will let you, especially as they know where you live!  Although, on that note, reach out to your neighbours - some of them might be alright!

I enjoy writing and took part in [NaNoWriMo](www.nanowrimo.org), I still don't have a finished novel, but I signed up to the 'regions' local to me (still about a half hours drive away) and went along to the 'write-ins', which became a writing club which meets twice a week (if you can make it). Officially we are all trying to write novels (sometimes writing happens) but mostly we drink beer &amp; eat curry. I would class a few of the other writers as friends now. A few of the guys in the writing club also go to 'coding' events, no idea which website it's organised through, but technically minded people take their laptops to a pub &amp; drink, eat &amp; write code. Pretty anti-social hobbies usually, but they all seem like nice people.

Finally, I joined forums. Just the ones about things I am interested in, one was a fanclub (since morphed into a Facebook group) and one was a martial arts discussion thing - sadly shut down now. But I got to know some lovely people, some of whom I am still in touch with, and who I have met for meals and drinks and all of whom had something in common with me, even just one thing.

Obviously, it helped that I enjoy martial arts, because karate clubs (other martial arts are available) are ace places to meet people. We all have that in common and at an actual club most people are local. Our club has 2 official social events per year, but a lot of people meet up on their own for a drink afterwards or for barbeques or because neither of their wives want to see a film that they both want to see.

Also, more recently, although I have moved back 'home' to an area where I can't walk through the supermarket without stopping to say hello to someone. I actually made friends with a lady through Twitter and we are running buddies now. We go for a run (I say run, there is walking and gossiping and stopping for coffee), twice a week. She commented on something I tweeted because it came up with the 'local to me' thing that Twitter/tweetcaster can do if you have the gps on on your phone.

true,h33i0,eng-westmidlands,Now London...,"Yes, I understand it has increased and have observed the same phenomenon personally as well. I was basically asserting that it being a political tool of promotion by the Muslim brotherhood as the reason for its rise, is a baseless assertion and wrong. 

The Saudis promote across the Muslim world their own brand of Islam. This includes things like building mosques, printing Qurans (and books, pamphlets etc), sponsoring hajj trips etc. They do this with the goal of making their brand of islam the norm, one facet of this is a strict dress code that includes the veil. You will hear terms like Salafi and Wahhabi given to this group. 

The Muslim Brotherhood are a political organisation with a large influence on Egyptian life and a intellectual inspiration for other similar groups around the world but do not have financial or religious authority to impose or promote things outside of Egypt. It has a very limited impact on the wider muslim world. Saudi Arabia on the other has huge influence. You seemed to be conflating the two. 

One a side note, the financial aid given to the Muslim Brotherhood is politics. The Gulf Monarchies are staunch opponents since the cold war of the Nationalist Arab parties and naturally finance their opposition. Although the Muslim Brotherhood in an ideological sense is completely opposed to the concept of Islamic Royalty and would love to depose them. But the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

But to do so while in an important government role, particularly someone who is responsible for a lot of vulnerable people in need of funds/help, is a different matter.

From your perspective, you guys have real life commitment such as holiday with family or what ever which prevents you from playing that weekend. This doesn't mean you weren't serious about the tournament thing as you said from your previous response.

This is what I meant by on a personal level, and I didn't say you weren't.

My original quote was that, in combination of roster changes, you guys weren't able to pull together collectively on the said weekend, this gave the impression you guys were not taking it serious enough and hence invitation was revoked. This is taken from the admins perspective. For whatever reason this is the first time the ukdota admins were thinking of allowing you guys attend, (from their perspective) yet you guys were still moving roster around and cannot fully commit/attend the whole event.

Sure, this doesn't mean the admins were 100% right on this, but none the less, they weren't 100% wrong and that was probably the impression they had, not mine, I am just here acting as a medium to explain to you.

The fact that you took my quote out of context, was because that I never challenged the level of commitment on your personal level.

It is like saying that:
I say ""it is cold today (in the uk)"". Then you come along generalizing ""it is 35 celcius in Dubai, today is not cold"". You drew the wrong conclusion yourself.

You will need:

- Cheese (your choice, I like cheddar)

- Lettuce

- Tomato

- Cucumber

- Pickle (Branston, small or large chunk is your choice)

- Mayo/Salad Cream

After gathering the basic ingredients, you can then add what you like. The obvious choice would be ham, but you can also add beef, chicken, turkey, etc. Or all of them.

If you have a few more veg, you could add celery if you like it, or mushroom, onion, etc.

For a bit of fancy pants action you could use a George Foreman or just a pan to fry the sandwich first (no salad just meat and cheese) and then add the salad after. It's quite nice doing that as you can then have it with chips and have it as a meal of sorts.

I'll point out that with the above there's not a lot of point adding crisps to the mix as there are so many flavours and textures they just sort of get lost and wasted. By all means have a bag with the sandwich but have them on the side, they'll be more enjoyed that way.

Edit: for a quick snack I like Tuna Mayo and Cheese. Get a half baked baguette, whack it in the oven, make your tuna mayo and grate the cheese.

His wife, who is a nurse, feared for his life and urged him to go to a hospital.** He refused. He called in sick to work the day after the race. In truth, he couldn’t move. He began to wonder if he’d make it through the night.

“I thought I was dying,” he says, “but I thought to myself that if I did, I’d be OK with that, because I’d done something impossible.” He woke up the next morning happy to be alive, happy that he’d completed his first ultra, and even happier that he was closer to getting into Badwater.

We start off with Nine, who glomps onto Rose as a way to deal with PTSD, while she is completely oblivious to him sexually (witness her interactions with Adam and Jack). It's probably not healthy, but it is very interesting to watch from a psychological standpoint, and Nine never crosses any boundaries (though he comes close by threatening to strand her in her own past in *Fathers Day*).

At the very end, he kisses the Bad Wolf, which I did find very skeevy and uncomfortable to watch (""I think you need a Doctor!""). However, I was willing to handwave it either by going with RTD's explanation that it was more like mouth-to-mouth than a romantic kiss, or that he was really kissing the TARDIS, in Rose's body.

Whatever, the case, *BAM*, regeneration!

Suddenly, the Doctor is young and foxy! And, suddenly, Rose is interested! Phwoar!

Mind you, he has no intention of returning her feelings in any meaningful way-- because emo Lonely God, that's why-- but he sure does like being on the receiving end of her affection. As if that wasn't bad enough, the same thing that Ten does to Rose, Rose does to Mickey... keeping him on the emotional hook with no intention of following through.

Mickey eventually got the memo and moved forward, experiencing character growth. Rose repeatedly had the memo *taped to her eyeballs*, and she still never internalized it (see *School Reunion* and the excruciating mortgage conversation in *The Impossible Planet*).

Eventually, Rose gets a happy ending foisted on her, literally kicking and screaming the whole way (*Doomsday*). Her family is reunited, and she has the money and privilege to do anything that she wants to with her life.

Of course, what she wants to do is to risk destroying the universe to get back to the Doctor. This decision does end up saving the Doctor's timeline in *Turn Left* and (arguably) helping resolve things in *Journey's End*, but it's important to note that Rose had no way of knowing this when she first started punching holes in reality.

But Ten can't let her stay afterwards! Oh, no. Because she has to babysit Handy. ""He's too dangerous to be left on his own"", you know. So here, you deal with him. It'll be all right though-- it's like having your own Doctor-shaped blow-up doll, plus he can walk and talk (including, apparently, saying the word ""love"" out loud) and he'll die in a few decades, so there you go. Pity about the unapologetic genocide-- see if you can do something about that, would you? Bye, now!

I honestly cannot think of a less healthy message for young women: chase after an unattainable man to the detriment of yourself and the people around you for long enough, and you will eventually be rewarded with a cheap knockoff that is almost what you wanted, but not quite. And, oh, by the way, the knockoff has issues a mile deep, and it's your responsibility to fix him.

This is why my blood pressure rises whenever I think about the Ten/Rose arc (and apparently it's not over yet-- whoopee!). It's also why I will make subconscious judgements about fans, particularly young women, who idolize the pairing. Because it's not romantic, it's not empowering... it's just sad, and a bad message.",0,1379350848,null,0,false,0,cc9ik6p,t3_1mgwep,t1_cc9ik6p,t3_1mgwep,null,1429443679,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

true,william-in-the-hague,null,null,"&gt; No, they can't - because they are poor. I'd suggest if you are looking for some kind of Utopia where everyone is equal, you could make a first step by selling all your possessions and giving the value to people poorer than you. You wouldn't want to be a hypocrite, after all ...

This kind of argument is quite common place, but it isn't rational or honest at all. Making myself destitute is in no way a cure for inequality so there is nothing hypercritical about that statement. The straw man of utopianism is a thought terminating cliche, and just because one cannot obtain utopianism doesn't mean we can't strive for betterment:

* We cannot cure all diseases, we should give up then.
* We cannot stop everyone from speeding, so let's do away with speed limits.

It's a moronic or sadistic argument. I'll let you pick.

&gt; Because legitimizing systematic large-scale violence against anyone with more money than you in a repeat of the French Revolution is a great way of demonstrating how civilized you are. 

Again that's not rational or honest. Being opposed to obscene wealth is not the same as wanting the death of all those with higher scores in a very myopic crude financial metric we call sterling.

Maybe though you shouldn't take everything so literally. However, No social movement was given power, it had to be taken and usually always through a combination of mass protest and targeted violence, whether that was blacks scaring the shit of the establishment, women throwing themselves under horses and fire bombing politicians houses (Pankhurst), slaves revolting in Haiti, or the French Revolution.

&gt; And of course, it was such a demonstrable success, as everyone in France is of equal wealth and status now ... oh, wait ...

Again this is a stupid use of utopianism. The reference to the guillotine was about the invoking the spirit of the age—the monarchy was always a disgusting institution that caused a great deal of poverty and ""large scale violence"" world wide which both continue to this day.

They have definitely improved under Laudrup, their style has developed from passing for the sake of passing to controlling the game and actually going forward. Rogers has also improved though, we made a similar transition in January as it wasn't really working for us. Also look at the change in their attacking options since promotion. Graham and Lita to Bony and Michu.

They lack penetration because the direct approach isn't their style at all, there wear teams down and pick them apart slowly. When the oppositions concentration and energy withers they usually go and get the goals, 70 minutes onwards often sees them get the killer goal or add a few more. Bony, Michu and Vasquez will score goals.

They have a decent selection of wingers that all bring something different, they're not consistently great but they're players you can't really dismiss because any can make something happen out of nowhere, especially Hernandez.

Chico and Williams aren't superstars but they make a good partnership and compliment eachothers qualities. Plus they've got Vorm behind them and a defence looks much more stablewhen it goes unchanged for long periods of time. A good example of this type of defence was Roger Johnson and Scott Dann playing together in front of Joe Hart at Birmingham. The year they were promoted they finished 9th on a basis of primarily defending well.

She then flirted with some guy she just met and handed him the key to the TARDIS.

She also flirted heavily with Capt. Jack without breaking it off with Mickey.

She would become insanely jealous whenever another woman even looked at the Doctor.

She treated Sarah Jane (Sarah Jane!!) like crap.

I thought it was really selfish of her when she told Mickey and her mom that she had nothing worth staying in their time for.

I can go on and on.  I don't know if it was the intent of the writers, but she came off as extremely juvenile.  

As far as a romance between her and the Meta-crisis, you have to ask yourself this...can you picture her in a relationship with a Metacrisis of the 1st Doctor? 2nd? 3rd? 4th? 5th - 9th?  They are all the same person afterall.  He's an old, old man who is sometimes in a young body.

I'm in the group that thinks that the Doctor should not be romantically involved with anyone, not because that's what Time Lords do, but because he's this tragic, forever wandering, genius-hero with the weight of the universe on his shoulders.  He can't be understood by others, human or timelord, because he just operates on a completely different wavelength - like Sherlock Holmes, in a way. 

As for Metacrisis...if he's human, won't he suffer the same fate as Donna?  If not, what does he do for a living in the other world? And would Rose still like him without his TARDIS to escape life in?

Come on dude, don't start with the strawmen. She can still wear her headscarf because her face can still be seen. Why would that lead to banning turbans or are you actually that dense?

In a court of law. Not in general.  Stop distorting the issue.

&gt;conversely not allowing Niqabis to conduct themselves how they choose is as most will agree disrespecting them. 

Well that's bullshit. No one is stopping them from wearing what they like, except when it comes to a court of law. Which changes everything.

Also, why is she demanding respect for her religion when she obviously doesn't follow it? Or our laws for that matter.

No, but no employer has the time or the patience to hire someone and then wait 2 months for them to start the role.

In my experience (I've been in the software industry for 5 years now) the immediate ""solution"" has always been to hire a contractor. Need someone to start in a weeks time? Get your mate at RecruiterCorp on the phone, he'll have a contractor in your office in no time. 

I suspect *this* is the real reason why entry level jobs for CS graduates are hard to come by, the contractor market is so liquid with experienced people, employers just don't want to put in the effort to help people up the ladder.

  Firstly you may want to ask them for the billing dates, water bills are generally billed April - March, they may have placed the bill from then on your account as they assume (even though you told them) you moved in back in April. 

  If the billing dates are correct, request to see what the full supply address is, you may find your property you are living in is billed collectively when you may only be liable for one part of the bill. 

  A word of advise, anything they do or amend, ask for confirmation via letter/email. Water companies generally place an outstanding bill with debt collecting agencies, and if it does get placed with a DCA they may then just point you in the direction of them to make repayments, and it will be incredibly difficult to fight your claim if there are any mistakes on the account without evidence in letter/email form.

true,Vardy,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"Luckily I got employed as IT support shortly after leaving Uni in 2011, however my skills and knowledge were greatly undervalued and I worked for minimum wage.

I left that job at the start of the year after finding something much better. I'm now renting my own place far away from my family and I am slowly moving up the working ladder. But I still believe without that first job, I won't have my current one.

From this experience, I would say that expectations on both sides need to be lowered. All those promises made by lecturers and parents are mostly crap. You won't leave uni and get a well paid job. You need to accept that job for £6.19/hour and look at is as a stepping stone for another job. However, employers also need to lower their expectations of people in the IT sector.

true,mikesw,mccoy,McCoy,"That's how I felt at first, but then I realized it's just character development. 

Both times we first see Clara, she's personable, she's flirting with the Doctor and she's just kind of cheeky. 
Then when the Doctor finds her from the third time, she's really different. She's not great with computers and she seems very overwhelmed by the reality of the aliens and these new dangerous situations she's been thrown into. 

Then the Doctor, having spent some time obsessing about her, asks her to travel with him and she's wary of this strange alien man so she asks for some time to think.

In Hide, she listens to the Doctor telling her not to wander off because she's freaked out. In Journey to the Center of the Tardis she's arguing with the Doctor about piloting the Tardis, comfortable enough now to challenge his authority a bit. 

In the Cyberman episode she sees a dark, Cyberman version of the Doctor, who expressly tells her that the Doctor has some secrets, and that he's very interested in her."" Of course the Doctor reassures her and in the end, saves the kid's she's babysitting. She also mentions in this episode, that she trusts the Doctor but doesn't believe he has a plan. 

At this point, the Clara's a lot more comfortable with the Doctor. He's not just some mystery man who showed up to fix the wifi, he's a guy who travels around saving people. Clara trusts him now, and he trusts her enough to take her with him to Trenzalore, a place that he openly broke down crying about in front of her before they left. 

Then all that Trenzalore stuff happens, Clara understands that that's the Doctor's timestream, and when he's in danger, she realizes what she has to do to save this man that's she's grown quite fond of and she sacrifices herself without knowing what will happen. That's why the Clara he met before is so coy and playful, because she developed from being just a regular girl to someone who trusts and is instinctively comfortable. The Clara that jumps into the timestream isn't some scared earth girl anymore.

This has gotten to be pretty lengthy now so I'll wind it down. I like Clara because she's actually been allowed to grow as a character. She's not just a static, generic one-liner spouting, ""not afraid of anything"" companion. That being said, hopefully from here on out, Clara will continue to have a more open personality.

TLDR: Clara was a normal girl who grew to more comfortable with the Doctor while traveling and getting to know him, and by the time she jumps into the timestream, she's become a lot more openly personable in the face of alien danger.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"There is some truth in what you say.

Cannabis is both a [bronchodilator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchodilator) (causing the bronchi in the lungs to dilate and facilitate better airflow) and an [expectorant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectorant) (causing the lungs to increase secretions that help clear mucus).  As counterintuitive as it may seem, it can be very effective in the treatment of asthma and other respiratory problems.

In contrast, nicotine is a vasoconstrictor (causing blood vessels to constrict) so it has the opposite effect, causing the lungs to ""close up"".  So in that specific context, cannabis smoke is significantly less harmful than tobacco smoke and may actually have some beneficial effects.

However, inhaling any kind of smoke is bad for your lungs.  The short term benefits of better respiration are offset by long term damage to the lungs.

The solution is to use a vaporiser.  This doesn't burn the cannabis but heats it so that the active ingredient is vaporised (like steam, not smoke).  Vaporising is believed to be a completely safe delivery method.  That's not to say that cannabis itself is completely safe, but if you're taking it anyway then vaporising will deliver it into your bloodstream quickly and efficiently without causing any additional harm to your body.  The same cannot be said of smoking.  

TL;DR: Cannabis smoke isn't good for you, it's just less bad than tobacco smoke.  Vaporising is generally accepted to be safe.

I submit that that is less ""Mr. Darcy"" and more ""complete, irredeemable prick"". And this is *before* he tries to *choke her to death*. Y hallo thar, normalization and minimization of violence against women! And when Peri chastises him not for being horrible and creepy and murderous but *rude*, he responds that he's an alien. This makes it OK?
* Attack of the Cybermen. Remember how, in 1966, the Cybermen ship was going to be discovered in Antarctica in 1986? (""The Tenth Planet"") No? Then boy, are you ever not the audience for this. This entire story is built around the idea that you, a casual TV watcher, should be so obsessed with a missing 20-year-old story that you must find out how the Doctor's destruction of Mondas in ""The Tenth Planet"" affected the discovery of the Cyberman ship due to happen the following year in realtime... basically, it's so fanwanky it gives fanwank a bad name.

It could be argued that originally it was an emancipatory act but that now it ironically has the opposite effect. 


I do however have a problem with you labelling Islam as something or anything, religions themselves are generally all pure, peaceful and encourage the betterment of society and humanity as a whole.

Personally I think Scotoil's FS365 is better. It doesn't last as long as ACF50 and you do have to keep reapplying as you wash the bike  but it is much easier to get off and does the same job. Neither is it expensive. A litre bottle should last a Winter.

If you start from the position that religion can do no wrong, then you can always argue that it's people's interpretation which is faulty.  The same arguments were used for Revolutionary Communism, which killed millions. 

I will never be able to convince anyone in a Reddit comment to change their views on religion, but at least consider the idea that it should be possible to criticize Islam in the same way we criticize any other ideology.

true,intangible-tangerine,eng-Bristol,Brizzlefoshizzle,"Currently Prince Harry would be eligible to stand for parliament as he does not have a seat in the house of Lords. However if, in the future, he's given a seat in the Lords he would become ineligible and have to stand down. 

This is what happened with Tony Benn, he was meant to inherit a Lordship from his father but instead renounced it to remain an MP. 

Note that although a very few senior royals have the right to sit in the house of lords none of them have any voting rights as these were abolished about 15 years ago. 

When Prince William was given a Dukedom recently the right to sit in the house of lords was not stipulated as it had been for his uncles' Dukedoms, which suggests the link between the Royal family and the Lords is being phased out except for the Queen's central ceremonial role. 

Although there is nothing in law to prevent a non-Lords Royal from standing for election as an MP there is a very strong culture within the British system that Royalty must not interfere with the commons and so if any Royal did wish to stand it's likely that they would have to renounce their place in the succession just as Benn had to renounce his Lordship.

Furthermore i do completely agree that if it's about choice then teach everyone all views at an early age and then let them make their own informed decisions when they reach adulthood.

This is what I don't understand about anti-racists. Firstly you've got to be racist to be anti-racist - otherwise how else can you identity your targets by their skin colour? Then comes their primary purpose: **hate** - which kind of defeats the purpose of tolerance in the first place.

Finally: how does one measure ""racism""? Is it an all-or-nothing test? Or a scale-of-grey test? Do the anti-racists accept that there are about hundred different definitions of racism and therefore ""hating racism"" is about an elusive target as finding a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow?

How does one prove they are *not* a racist - to dodge the scorn of the modern moralists? Television serials imply that I need a black friend to qualify, but why won't an Asian or Oriental friend satisfy this test? Why should I have to have different coloured friends to prove that I'm not racist? Doesn't this make me racist to go around and point out the skin colour of my friends in order to justify claiming others are racist?

I advocate banning the veil in schools because it very likely harms children who have to wear it.  It limits their ability to communicate and teachers' ability to interact with the child.  It also fosters a tribalist us vs them mentality as it sends out a clear message that the child is from a different culture that has little in common with UK society.  Finally- it reinforces the idea that women are the property of their husbands and their fathers.

If women freely choose to go along with a garb which symbolizes patriarchal oppression then so be it, but I find it much harder to defend the idea that a 12 year old girl has much say in the matter.  

I'm not some kind of authoritarian jackbooted bigot.  I'm simply defending the idea of having a school dress-code and I don't see why religion should trump all else.

Well you *could* know this if you *could* identify the person wearing the niqab in the first place. But you *can't*. And the UK is full of cons.

So how do you *know* for sure the person wearing it isn't a rebellous teenage girl. Or boy for that matter? Children will always push boundaries. And what about criminals? In the land of CCTV there would be *compelling* reasons to don such clothing to commit crimes.

You couldn't believe this is possible because you've been beaten into submission by the morality brigade but I can tell you I've met verbally abusive young ladies (at least that's what they sounded like) with very low-class British accents (not foreign sounding in the least) that were wearing the full face veil in public - so I've become rather suspicious of the motivations of anyone wearing them now.

Also, 10W40 (pronounced ten forty I believe) semi synthetic oil, works well into the minus numbers - You'll probably need about a litre of the stuff (£7)

When cleaning your chain, just get the chunky stuff off basically, don't spend ages with a brush getting all parts of the chain - I find it decreases the life of your chain dramatically, unless you want to wash and relube it every couple of days.

Cleaning: Hein Gericke do (possibly did) a really good cleaning set that is a bucket, sponge, chain cleaner, chain lube, and spray cleaner for 12 nuggets. I'd recommend adding a dedicated chain brush and a few other brushes for bits the sponge can't get into. 

Tools: For a small toolkit, I'd say that it is a good idea to spend an hour or so going over the bike and building a good toolkit with attachments for all the nuts etc that you might encounter with roadside fixable issues. I have a really good one from Draper, which is a 35 Piece ratchet screwdriver, socket and bit set. It is smaller than you hand in a solid box and has saved me a few times now. You will obviously want to get a bigger, better kit built up at home, but this is a pretty good start! 

Locks: I always carry an oxford screamer disk lock when I'm on the move. It is pretty good and I think I got it for about 30 nuggets. Pisses off the neighbours in the morning if you aren't quick, but worth the inconvenience. When it is locked up overnight, I have a heavy as hell chain and padlock on an anchor and a fairly heavy duty ""U"" metal lock. There was a thread with a bike thief a while ago and he said that one of the best things is a cover and loud alarm combo. Cover hides from opportunists and alarm gets you out there/scares them off.

true,burnyourfriends,english,Norfolk,"I work at a water company down south. Just a quick question to work out what your best option is, if you don't mind:

* When was the property split into flats? I ask this because the rates were set back in the 80s, and they are unable to be changed, so the unmeasured charges are fixed, and there's no way of changing them. Some bright spark in the 90s had the great plan of setting the chargeable value at a fixed amount for any properties split up, no mater what their size. (The chargeable value was set to 180). This basically means that a 1 bedroom flat could end up paying the same amount as a large family house, which isn't fair at all.

* Unfortunately, I highly doubt that there's anything that you can do about the bills. Charging for water based on rateable value isn't a very fair way of doing it at all, and a lot of companies are now forcing people on to meters so that they can charge for water fairly. Your only option for the bills would be to learn from them this time, and make sure you're on a meter in the future.

If your landlord really doesn't want you to have a meter fitted, then speak to Yorkshire water about ""assessed measured charges"". It might be called something different in a different company, but it's a scheme set up for people that are unable to have a meter fitted for whatever reason, and it calculates your bill based on number of occupiers, what type of house it is and the average usage of the property should be based on those two factors.

true,dun_can,null,null,"What most will agree with is that Deulofeu is one of the biggest up coming prospects in the football world, some would say more, but he definitely isn't the type of player for the premier league, let alone the Everton we all love. I'll explain...

Go back to last season, and Gerard was playing in the Spanish 2nd Division for Barcelona B and was showing what an outstanding player he could be. However, the way he plays is that he is given the ball along the wing or even the centre of the pitch and just goes. He runs, he might pass or cross or even shoot, that's al he thinks about. He will even try to take it past a player or two, which we have even seen him do quite a few times. And that's the thing.

It doesn't work every time, especially in the prem. What would happen at Barca B is, sometimes, he would lose the ball trying to pass a player or pass, and within so many seconds or minutes he would have the ball back because a) the team would always be covering him and if he lost the ball they'd get it back and b) they could do that over and over.

This meant that he never had to think about running back to help out (much), he could just wait for the ball again. Here in the prem it doesn't work like that. I know our style of football has changed under Martinez to a more passing format, but will still can't provide what Gerard is used to or really needs. That's why he won't make it into the first team, but with an change in style we could see him after Christmas, maybe.

And another thing, it seems him and Coleman don't really gel on the pitch too much, Coleman wants to burst up the wing and needs help from Deulofeu, but just doesn't get it. In my opinion, Coleman is a much more vital player, and most if not all of you can agree that he is much more important than Gerard for first team football and the season ahead.",0,1379364841,null,0,false,0,cc9nvkj,t3_1mdy6k,t1_cc9nvkj,t3_1mdy6k,null,1429441128,2,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,2

Coutinho is the fulcrum of our team - when he came off we played like United did against us, very little creativity. Sturridge was getting in good positions but no one was giving him the service. Even when Coutinho isn't on the ball he's hustling and busting and pulling defenders away.

Sahko was hot and cold - needs more time

Mignolet is a better shot stopper than Reina, needs to work on his distribution. Overall a brilliant buy

Sturridge is great

Moses looks pretty lively, good goal.

It started in the first half already, too content to pass the ball around midfield, only Lucas and Gerrard brave enough to actually pass it up the field to players. Not much creativity going on. Meanwhile Swansea were starting to push up into our final third with ease with no pressure from us.

The second half was just like that, times ten. No ball retention, no pressure, just falling back and hoping the Swansea onslaught would end. It didn't. Hence hoofing the ball up the field on the rare chance we got possession. Sloppy play leading to lots of fouls and a few yellows. Maaan was I glad at the final whistle!

Also, wtf Wisdom &amp; Sakho. OK it was his first game, maybe some jitters, but that moment near the end when he got the ball near the touchline and just sort of looked at it like ""what is this round object before me?"", fumbled it around a bit to himself, opposition came up and took it right from him.

2. Sterling showed no reason why he deserves a first-team call-up for now. I understand the kid is only 18, but I thought he completely lacked composure when he came on; as of now, I don't trust Sterling to turn a game around.

Great in the air, but nearly every ball on the ground he contests and his positioning was what lead to both goals (watch the lead up to the goals conceded). I really want either agger/toure as atleast one of the 2 CDs because the organisation is just not as good without them.

Wisdom - not of enough quality to be a starter but who else do we have fit? Toure was better but Swansea looked so dangerous down that side right to the last minute.

Moses - Looked really good. Great goal, should have got an assist. Can run through players and is strong on the ball. The only issue was fitness. He's not as hungry in defence and his level fell off at the end which is why he had to be subbed. That should improve with training. Im liking him as a starter.

We do seem to go missing all of the 2nd half we've played except this time we conceded once rather than soaking the pressure. I don't know if it was because coutinho was such a linch pin or they just lacked fitness (which would be weird with such a long break). But we were barely trying to make a pass in that last 20min with no one running into space.


Over 90min yeah a draw is fair, and i wouldve been ok with it at the start of the match. Still top of the table boys.

No choices are totally free, the same societal and communal boundaries which mean that some girls are brought up to wear veils are also used to control many aspects of children's lives in Judeao-Christian or indeed atheistic and agnostic households. Why is the decision to wear a veil more intrusive a restriction that decision over what language a child is brought up in, where they live, what school they go to (if any), who they associate with, what toys they can and cannot play with or indeed what is or isnt a toy to begin with. None of these are choices made totally freely be a child, and if you are to insist that wearing a viel should be prevented by law you need to demonstrate why the choice over what a child wears is different to these other choices.

Moreover the argument that it fosters a tribalist us vs them mentality is not only one I disagree with, but one I abhor. An expression of cultural identity is not a pretext for or an invitation to be treated as some kind of outsider. It is only because of the virulent Islamaphobic environment in the UK that you would consider employing such an argument.  Wearing hessitic dress also sends out a clear message that one is from a particular culture and community, as does a turban, as does a football shirt or a kilt. I doubt that you would accept the anti-tribalist argument as a reason to ban any of those.

Furthermore, I do not accept that it is purely a symbol of considering women property. I think that, as in mainstream western culture, the treatment of women depending on dress is really rather complex and I am incredulous that that would be a reason to ban it. If we are to tackle the objectification of women in society, then the overt sexualization of young women and girls, the portrayal of women in the media and the lack of meaningful female respresentation in positions of leadership are far more meaning ful ways to go about it. 

&gt;If women freely choose to go along with a garb which symbolizes patriarchal oppression then so be it, but I find it much harder to defend the idea that a 12 year old girl has much say in the matter.

What something someone wears symbolises to you is not always what it smybolises to them. It is what it smybolises to them that matters. The law has no business telling people what they can or can't express through dress or how they can or can't express it. And when it's a 12 year old (of either gender) I would much rather it be their parents deciding what they do or don't wear than the state.

true,Nark2020,null,null,"Interesting thread. Upvotes not downvotes from me. Long, wandering comment follows, pat on the back for anyone who gets to the end.  

My first point would be: are you actually banned from wearing a balaclava in all public spaces? I genuinely don't know. Does anyone here work/study law and know where we could find out? Google isn't playing ball at the moment. 

My second point would be that where balaclavas and bicycle helmets *are* banned - and I know I've been in banks and hospitals that stated that, so they must be in at least some places - they are banned because people use them, not only to cover their faces, but to cover their faces *with the intention of committing a crime*. 

My third point is that your hypothetical, like a lot of hypotheticals people use to challenge equality laws, doesn't really work because (I assume?) you don't *actually* fear unwanted sexual contact from women. 

Another common hypothetical is where someone who is not religious says 'Well, if some people are allowed prayer-breaks, can't *I* demand ten minutes of free time per day and say it's part of my religion?' Again, same problem: employers only allow prayer-breaks because it really is part of someone's religion. 

Likewise, I could say 'But I don't cry discrimination when people are rude to me because I wear glasses!', but then, people being rude to me about glasses isn't the same as everyone in your office calling you a spastic because you're autistic. 

And so on. I think a better example would be for someone who needs to wear a cross as a sign of religious devotion asking why they can't wear that in the workplace if someone else is allowed to wear a niqab. 

&gt; My issue with the Niqab is that is has no basis within Islam, it's a purely social and cultural construct, 

Yes, and this point needs to be better-known. Niqab *specifically* is not demanded by the Koran, although modest dress is. This could just be a scarf worn loosely and showing most of the face, IIRC. 

&gt; however it does, i feel, both fly against the ideals of living in a free, civilised and inclusive society 

My problem here is that these are huge, abstract words which could mean almost anything - free? civilised? inclusive? In fact I think they're unhelpful. 

&gt; as well as alienating those who wear it from the general public. 

I agree that this is a possible danger. It depends who the general public are. 

&gt; I also know of no women who wears it who does so without the pressure of the males in her life or many years of being told all men will only see her as a sexual object and it'd stop unwanted advances....

This is, as you know, anecdotal evidence. Someone who wanted to counter it could probably find a bunch of people who wear it without these negative reasons. A change to the law would require a deep survey of people's actual life experiences re: the niqab, and I think this is the best form of 'national debate' we could have. But how to go about this survey, I do not know.

On unwanted sexual advances: to me, the idea that men will approach women and pester them for sex sounds strange. But then, that's because I'm not really the sort of person who would do that on the street. But I have seen it happen on the street, certainly. Whether or not it's a legitimate thing for people to get concerned about kind of depends on where in the country we're talking about. 

Now what I basically think is that we often hear about a conflict between 'Islamic' and 'Western' values in the UK, and that people when they say 'western values', usually in articles in the guardian or the times, tend to mean, oh, watching Shakespeare plays, going to classical music concerts, reading the guardian or the times. 

In other words, there's a pretty big difference between the London-centric, middle and upper-middle class dinner party conception of what 'Western' or 'British' values are, and the values of, say, the non-Muslim population of Burnley. All these wonderful ideas about freedom and liberty and blah blah are not actually very relevant to people in post-industrial towns or inner-cities. 

There the conflict lies, not so much between Islamic and Western values, as between 'going to a Mosque regularly and centering your life around family and community', vs 'teenage binge-drinking, pregnancy, single-parenthood and benefit dependency, rinse and repeat'. 

Me personally, I wouldn't necessarily want to have to pray five times a day, live under food restrictions and fasting, pay money to relatives when working, and find a marriage partner who meets the parents' standards, if not have them decide on one for me; sure. 

But if it's a choice between having at least some standards, and being a total drop-out with no future, well. And it kind of is that stark of a choice for a lot of people, not just with Islam but also evangelical Christianity in poor black areas where gang crime is a problem.

To sum up, for those dedicated readers I haven't bored away yet: I'm not going to vote for any more restrictions on Islamic dress than currently exist, without first coming to a conclusion based on data (people's experiences, how coerced are they) that doesn't, so far as I know, exist yet; and I do have quite some sympathy for people who live in the real world (tabloid land, not broadsheet land) and who use religion to get through their lives in a better way.

true,forgottenoldusername,eng-manchester,It is indeed grim up north.,"This sums up my view perfectly. 

I don't care if you chose to wear a Niqab walking down the street, I don't care if you chose to wear a mask walking down the street, or even cover your entire head with water balloons. As long as your not alarming people, there isn't anything to complain about.

As you say, allowing exceptions based on religion or gender is wrong.

To me, it's as if we're saying one persons opinions and choices are more worthy than those of someone else. Sure, it might be a bit strange to wear a mask. But if someone says 'Oh, it's my belief though!' how can we realistically stand there and say 'Well tough shit, your belief isn't valid', while we seem to allow the beliefs of another person?

Sure, you could say that wearing a mask isn't a real belief. But in the past we've said plenty of things aren't worthy of being considered legitimate belief, did the roman empire not appose many a religion? 
The major religions today have not been around since time immemorial, I'm sure that in another few thousand years a few of them won't be around just in the same way Germanic deities aren't playing a major part in our current day.

The point I'm getting at, who is able to stand there and say what is right and wrong in belief. 

Believe what you want, but at certain times we need to be rational and bring all belief out of the system. Deal in cold, hard fact. A court is a perfect example of one of them places.

His worst habit is stepping out of his line and making the lunging tackle. It puts you in a win/lose situation. Agger would step out, but he would stand the player, while Sakho was taking crazy risks. If you watch a replay of the game, you will see him do this 4 or 5 times before the second goal and it would lead to a huge space behind him and Skrtel outnumbered. 

It is going to take some time for him to get adjusted to our style of defending. I think in the interim we must start Kolo, Agger, Skrtel. The Shelvey assist was a prime example of how what Sakho does goes wrong. A good defender never ends up on the ground, especially when he has his back to goal and when the attacking player is infront of him. There is no excuse for that. A good centerback will make one or two of those tackles a game but it will be coming back towards his own goal, everything else is about position and anticipation.

OK: I think that if a state demands to be able rule over a man, it should pay for that right by ensuring he has a roof over his head and does not starve. Is that clearer? I mean, that's pretty much a right that feudal peasants had - do you think that we should have less?

It is the state that says I cannot occupy your spare bedroom or erect a tent on Balmoral estate. Or at least it's the state that's complicit in that, and which enforces that Balmoral estate is given to a singular genetic heir, instead of shared fairly between all citizens.

&gt; for there to be wealth to give then wealth has to be taken from the earners/makers. This is immoral and unethical.

I hope you see now where we disagree. I think it's immoral for someone to be rich only because they were born rich, and that *does* deprive others of a roof over their head.

Further to that, i've lived in many countries over the years and i would actually say the UK is the most equal and generally least divisive country i've been to. Equality to me is less about who gets what and more about the fact that at the end of it since we all bleed, shit, breath and eat we are the same.

Obviously, a bloke wearing a balaclava isn't a  ""standard"" religous belief. You wouldn't fall into a clear structure or belief system, as you don't have any other followers. 

So you would have to convince a court, on the balance of probabilities, that it is a ""philisophical belief"". To pass this standard, your belief that women are so attracted to you that the only way to prevent sexual harassment is to wear a balaclava at all times must: 

* be genuinely held 
* be a belief and not an opinion or viewpoint, based on the present 
state of information available 
* be a belief as to a weighty and substantial aspect of human life 
and behaviour 
* attain a certain level of cogency, seriousness, cohesion and 
importance 
* be worthy of respect in a democratic society, compatible with 
human dignity and not conflict with the fundamental rights of 
others.

[from ACAS guidance on religion or belief]. You probably wouldn't have too much difficulty with the last three, but the first two might be a little tricky. We know your belief isn't genuinely held, because you've told us as much here, this is some kind of point scoring exercise, but let's assume the court hasn't seen your internet history, or that you seriously believe that. You must then convince a court that your reading of scripture has lead you to believe that a balaclava is the way forward. This would be a civil case, so balance of probabilities here (51% chance of you telling the truth) it's possible. 

Next up, you would have to show that this is a belief, and not an opinion based on recent events, which again, we know it is, but let's again assume the court doesn't. I guess this would depend when you brought your claim, right now you might have difficulty, as this case is in the news and the defence would point to this as your motivation. If you could show some articles of scripture that back this belief up that would help you; I am not familiar with the Quran, so I don't know if you could pass the 51% test or not. 

The only other stumbling block would be cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance. If you only wear your balaclava when going out to annoy shopkeepers, then you would probably have a bit of difficulty with this one. So you would have to actually wear the balaclava all the time. So at work, home, car, shopping, cinema, park, wherever. This seems like an awful lot of effort. 

Honestly, I don't think you would pass the tests, because you shouldn't. If someone did hold this as a philisophical belief, they might stand a chance. But it does kind of miss the point of equality legislation completely. And if you pulled a stunt like this and then someone found this reddit thread, you would most likely be guilty of perjury.

It requires large numbers of fairly fit but inexperienced juniors to do most the actual workload with few seniors and officers.

If you look at the police cuts on the other hand, they have basically halted recruitment -- so in effect the police force is ageing, with few new recruits in their early 20s entering the workforce compared to previous years. It's good now for cost but in the long term it means we will have an age range that is under-represented and and expensive top-heavy police force.

As you get older you come to appreciate a lot of organisations (particularly public bodies  like the forces, the NHS, the police etc.) Are FULL of senior people who have worked their way up to jobsworthy desk positions where they spend all day creating the appearance that they actually do useful work... It's a real plague on those organisations as it sucks up cash that could pay for several juniors, to pay for one prat in an office.

true,Snagprophet,eng-wiltshire,Wiltshire,"I've heard stories about police either tampering with evidence or introducing it when they're trying to charge someone they know is a wrongdoer. They might have been cutting corners because they couldn't be bothered to collect more evidence.

Was it covering up a mistake? They mistake his identity and shoot first and ask questions later? And thought he was holding a gun for some reason? But they brought the gun along, which they said he had, to say he was armed in the chance they got the wrong guy and needed to save their arses?

I certainly don't believe he was just some random off the street they thought they'd shoot. I mean does someone get paid extra for wrapping up a crime ring and felt if people think it was Duggan at the centre of it all and then if they organise a hit on Duggan and cover it up, it'll seem like one crime ring sorted out? I mean, either he was guilty of being dangerous, he was involved in a crime ring but loosely or he was completely innocent and the police either wanted to kill him for the lulz or they mistook him and just covered their tracks.

I really want to know the full scenario and I bet a lot of it is to do with communication. The idea of having someone on a list of suspects to be brought in, Duggan's on the list for whatever reason but he gets ticked off or he was accidentally put on there and then removed.

TBH I have no idea what it was apart from being very old. The sticks were held together with what looked like bits of sinew. The bags were full of bits of animal skin and some old earthenware pots about 10cm tall. We also found what looked like a human femur close by so decided it was all a bit creepy and left it alone after that.

true,narthgir,null,null,"Well, the government regulates other things we wear, and would be very unlikely to allow you to walk around with a balaclava without stopping you. But with the niqab, it's religious so you have to ""respect"" it. In my opinion, people are free to believe whatever they want, but that doesn't make them immune to criticism - however, still, to this day religious beliefs are given way more leeway than any other belief. 

If we were to be honest and say, well you can have your belief but officially as far as the government is concerned it's bollocks (as it is technically secular, but officially the monarch is head of the CofE anyway!), so in some situations your beliefs mean nothing. Tough luck. If you don't like it, learn to, because you live here and not somewhere else.

On a personal level I find one of the main, non-belief based, reasons to be insulting to both men and women; the idea that it must be worn as men could not control themselves otherwise reduces women to objects and men to rapists. 

However, I actually believe there should be few laws, if any, made. Instead, allow it as a concept to be openly outed as not only untrue to the Koran in the first place but also as both a ridiculous and insulting belief, lift the self imposed ban on criticising a religious belief while that very belief criticises our entire society, and we might begin to see it phase out.

Eto'o

Bench: Mata Willian Torres Ivanovic Lamps Mikel Schwarzer

**Justification for my choices:**

Starting Eto'o gives him a shot to gain some momentum against a weaker team, but if he struggles we have the better of our remaining strikers who can be swapped in.

I didn't start Willian because I think a win here would be a huge boost to the team and Wilian is a bit of an unknown factor right now. If we are up by more than one or clearly have the game under control there is no reason he shouldn't make his debut.

Mata on the bench because we probably won't need him, but just in case we do need a bit of magic, he's there.

Hazard was invisible against Everton, so I think a rest would do him good.

I chose Ramires and MVG in the pivot because I think MVG can handle the defensive duties, but just in case Ramires is a decent defender who still is an attacking threat, so he has some backup. Also, I though Ramires was one of our better players against Everton.

Chose Dave over Ivan because I believe our Serbian superman has played every game this season, so far. He could use a rest, but I have him on the bench as he is cover for two positions instead of one.

The only really hard choice I had was Cole/Bertrand. I chose Cole only because I have so many other players who haven't played this season already in. I think too much change from one week to another can cause problems. If I were JoMo I'd give him a run out against Swindon Town though.",0,1379379883,null,0,false,0,cc9tb63,t3_1mirzc,t1_cc9tb63,t3_1mirzc,null,1429438522,5,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,5

The reason you don't see other teams worry is they get away with it (at the top of the table) or they're so desperate they're more patient (at the bottom of the table).

We're in that middle place where we can't be patient and we need everyone performing at peak form to win games. No one really cared all that much the first games because we won. Now that we've drawn here come the boo birds.

The reality is he's been out of position. He operates best from where Henderson has been. Say all you want about the lad but he was never built to be a pure CAM like Coutinho. He's not strong enough to hold up the ball and he's not adapted to the league's physicality and speed in order to create space before he's closed down.

That final bit can come with time. Him being out of position is something Rodgers has to sort. I think Aspas can get some joy when Suarez comes back (which seems paradoxical but not really) because then our attack will be strong enough that we may not need Henderson (from the start). He can also play against weaker sides and still hopefully get stuff done.

People need to evaluate the guy on the terms of his signing. No one expected him to set the league alight. He was going to be, at the time of his signing, at best our third best scorer. If he picked up assists it'd be a bonus. I thought he made a lot of smart moves and passes in the first match against Stoke.

I don't think you can blame him for his performance today. Our entire squad has fallen off a cliff every 2nd half. He was coming in at the moment we were coming apart. And asked to do a job he was never signed to do. 

Let's give it some time. I still think he can be a solid option. And at his price, that's what we paid for. ",0,1379382887,null,0,false,0,cc9ud2r,t3_1mjheg,t1_cc9ud2r,t3_1mjheg,null,1429438031,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

You've made that judgement after 90 minutes? I thought he was quite poor tonight, and really though a lot of his sliding tackles were outlandish, but he's a great player - didn't captain PSG because he's poor. 

&gt; Aspas is a poor signing

I'm not sure which games you've been watching, but in his limited time on the pitch he's been fairly infuential IMO and added energy to the front line late in the match. 

&gt; Gerrard is really creaking.

Again, not sure which team you've been tuning into. Gerrard has been playing very deep in the midfield, even behind the CBs at times and his defending has been impecable. He hasn't put many shots on goal, and hasn't unlocked as many defenses as he usually does, but that doesn't mean that he's not playing well

As for Michu's goal, yes, his positioning was awful on that.  Concentration is something that I hope Rodgers helps Sakho develop (who is still quite young...)

But all that aside, he put in a commanding performance.  As a center back he's obviously going to be judged by the goals against and yes he was at the heart of both today.

true,KillerEyeDoc,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"An 'opinion based in recent events' is an interesting one.

As the disciples saw Jesus ascend to the heavens after he rose from the dead, they had to wait around a bit, twiddling their thumbs until the event was not 'recent' and only then Christianity was born!

Perhaps the writer of that definition could let us know when Mormonism became a religion, or even Scientology?

I think we are at an interesting time. It is almost impossible to define a religion and so it is therefore impossible to truly define religious rights. Agreed, we can probably decide that 'x' is a religion, perhaps the biggest and oldest ones are most recognisable, but note all of these titans were new and small at one stage! Even after this acceptance, it becomes very difficult to decide the strict religious beliefs of that group, indeed, many of Islam's adherents do not wear veils and the little I understand of it suggests that the Koran dictates modest dressing, but the more strict commandments come from 'other scriptures'. It cannot be up to the courts to decide theological arguments on behalf of religion.

Satanism and the Aztec religion are certainly old and potentially recognisable beliefs but no-one would support an adherent's right to human sacrifice and indeed the definition fudges around, although I propose this makes the definition fall down as these are obviously religions, albeit unpalatable ones!

Personally I do not think it is possible to define a religion. It is wrong to tell a person that what they feel is a religion is not a religion and I would object to anyone doing so.

Given this we have to apply common sense to the scenario in question. 

Common sense dictates that if a policeman needed to identify you, for the good of the community at large (even other balaclava wearers!) then you should have to take your balaclava off. 

If you are happily minding your own business and simply enjoying wearing your balaclava then you should be able to wear it and I would oppose any legislation that prevented you from enjoying the pleasure of a woolly cosy face!

# ` `

From article:

&gt; Some aspects of this bill even bear remarkable similarities to what was dubbed the ""Abolition of Parliament Bill"" - a bill introduced in 2006 by then Labour Minister Jim Murphy MP but heavily watered down after widespread outcry, including by the Liberal Democrat party conference. 

&gt; Collectively these changes significantly increase the power of the Executive over the voice of citizens and parliament. Will there be a similar outcry now? The first formal call for evidence to the Committee scrutinising the bill, closes this coming Monday.

&gt; Real freedom of information is about ""the money that goes in, the results that come out"", as opposed to ""FOI requests that are all about processes"".

&gt; That's the view of [the PM], which he expressed yesterday at the end of his evidence session in front of a House of Commons committee.

&gt; He distinguished between the increased transparency that derives from the publication of data (such as crime maps, local government spending and public sector contracts), which he is enthusiastic about, and what he called ""the endless discovery process"" of responding to FOI requests, which clearly doesn't appeal to him quite so much. 

&gt; [The PM's] stance can be seen as an illustration of what one international academic authority on FOI, Professor Al Roberts, has called ""executive pushback"" - attempts by political leaders to counter or undermine FOI laws.

&gt; [...]

&gt; **Q438 [Chair 1]**: I am just going to ask one question, because we have gone round it. We have talked a lot about private sector contracts delivering public sector services, and that being part of the issue. What we often come across is a difficulty in investigating those contracts because of commercial confidentiality. Would you consider, where public sector money is being used by private sector companies to deliver public services, whether we shouldn’t have freedom of information powers to follow that money into the private sector?

&gt; **[PM]**: I will certainly go away and look at this issue. I have to say that in my experience of two years, and the Freedom of Information Act and all the rest of it, it seems to me that real freedom of information is the money that goes in and the results that come out. Making government more transparent is the best thing. We spend an age-fortunately not me, but the system seems to-on dealing with FOI requests that are all about processes, but what the public, the country and Parliament need to know is how much money are you spending, is it being spent well and what are the results. I think we have approached, as a country, the wrong end of the telescope. What we are doing now includes the publication of the contracts; the publication of the outcomes; the publication of the information. You can go on a crime map; you can see where the crimes are being committed; you know how much the police are spending; you know where they are spending it; and you can break down local government spending to the last £500. That is freedom of information, but this endless discovery process that furs up the whole of Government-don’t worry, we are not making any proposals to change it.

&gt; **Q439 [Chair 1]**: Can I just say to you, Prime Minister, that even if we took quasi-public bodies, such as LOCOG and Network Rail, both of which are private sector entities-actually, Network Rail has got a very odd constitution, which I accept that we created-you cannot actually get the sort of data that you have set out, to try and see whether the money going in has given you the results you have wanted in a value-for-money way. You cannot get it.

&gt; **[PM]**: Fair enough, [Chair 1], but I would rather we went down the track of saying, ""What are the data we need published?"" rather than changing the Freedom of Information Act. I will go away and consider that point, but I think that publication of information is better than the discovery process, which I think furs up the arteries on occasions.

&gt; **Q440 [Lead Chair]**: If you are not going down the road of your predecessor Tony Blair, you may be making an offer to come to the Justice Committee and explain your views on freedom of information.

&gt; **[PM]**: Hopefully I skirted around that, so as to avoid that invitation.

What? You missed the bit where Duggan had no gun on him when searched after he ran from the taxi, and the lack of any ""Suspect raised a firearm"" statements in the subsequent police reports?  You must be high.

&gt;We don't have gung-ho police officers in the UK, this isn't America

While we don't on the whole, this episode shows a willingness to fire pre-emptively without evidence of the officers being in direct danger.  I sympathise with the need to make quick decisions, and Duggan was undoubtedly a very dangerous and unsavory man, but they got it wrong here.

edit:
The quotes on the Wiki page come from the Guardians reporting on the court case.

&gt;In all cases where context is critical, we balance a range of considerations, and our old Common Law had regular recourse to a fictional hero of English Jurisprudence - 'The Reasonable Man'. 

&gt;For the avoidance of doubt, Brother Ivo happily confirms that 'The Reasonable Woman' is no less sagacious, but the language derives from a particular time and culture, and rather than clutter the narrative, he asks readers' indulgence for his using the term throughout.

&gt;The Reasonable Man is a thoroughly decent fellow: he is not extreme in his opinions; he is neither technically specialised nor adept in any particular field, but is also no fool. If you explain even complex things to him he can make a pretty sound judgement on all aspects of life, including complex matters of science, accountancy, culture and religion. He is probably a cultural Anglican, though nobody has thought to ask him. He and his values may well be looked down upon by the self-appointed intelligentsia but, being sensible, he bears this with a degree of equanimity. 

That said, I'm not especially familiar with Islam or the Islamic websites he cites.  For example, he links a [website that offers clothing tips for islamic women](http://www.islamicinsights.com/features/fashion/hajj-special-clothing-tips-for-sisters.html).

CS teaches you how to program in a generic way: how to solve problems, how to apply paradigms, how to measure and think about efficiency. Language specific constructs are deliberately abstracted away because they go out of date very quickly. Classic problems like sorting algorithms are a good place to start but that's first semester of first year stuff. CS is not just programming in the same way that chemistry isn't just using beakers and Bunsen burners. Programming is taught in the first year then used as a tool to solve problems in the 2nd and 3rd years.

If you want to learn collections frameworks for Java do an apprenticeship with a Java development house. If you want to learn how to use code to solve problems do programming 101 &amp; 102 in a good CS course.

If you try and hire a software developer straight out of uni based on a CS course prepare to be disappointed because they've not been learning MVC or Zend or .NET anything else like that. What you'll find is someone who's able to apply logic to problem, give them the tools and some patience and 9 times out of 10 you'll end up with a decent software developer because all the building blocks (programming, problem solving, logic, etc.) are already in place.",0,1379414545,null,0,false,0,cca15rc,t3_1mhy2q,t1_cca15rc,t1_cc9g95p,null,1429434815,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

What utter bullshit that you can't quantify and if you reference that CPGrey—a film by an idiot for idiots—I'll laugh in your face. The monarchy adds no value other than delusion for the widest population which is then leveraged by a great deal of centralised power. Her institution literally doesn't do anything other than collect rents; it makes nothing, it ""generates"" nothing, but it takes a great deal from the productive economy.

She doesn't even greet tourists or show them around her house. International tourism and the stats are clear on this, is driven not by monarchy but by business travel and having a family/friend/education anchor in the point of destination.

Findings:

There was an increased risk of any psychotic outcome in individuals who had ever used cannabis (pooled adjusted odds ratio=1·41, 95% CI 1·20–1·65). Findings were consistent with a dose-response effect, with greater risk in people who used cannabis most frequently (2·09, 1·54–2·84). Results of analyses restricted to studies of more clinically relevant psychotic disorders were similar. Depression, suicidal thoughts, and anxiety outcomes were examined separately. Findings for these outcomes were less consistent, and fewer attempts were made to address non-causal explanations, than for psychosis. A substantial confounding effect was present for both psychotic and affective outcomes.

Interpretation:

The evidence is consistent with the view that cannabis increases risk of psychotic outcomes independently of confounding and transient intoxication effects, although evidence for affective outcomes is less strong. The uncertainty about whether cannabis causes psychosis is unlikely to be resolved by further longitudinal studies such as those reviewed here. However, we conclude that there is now sufficient evidence to warn young people that using cannabis could increase their risk of developing a psychotic illness later in life.",0,1379415972,null,0,false,0,cca1bxy,t3_1mhqbw,t1_cca1bxy,t1_cc9l5tp,null,1429434664,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

While they did have this perception it was based more on managing morale and faulty information than actual quantifiable evidence, as the vast majority of the individuals in question had already been screened and found not to be a threat. Plus, I wasn't comparing the EDL to the Nazis, I was disputing the notion that Britain was taking a brave stand against the principle of fascism when in reality they were dragged kicking and screaming into a war few people wanted which they felt they could not avoid.

Oh, and just to point out, internment was exceptionally expensive, took up thousands of troops to enforce and was completely and utterly ineffective as the only threats with two exceptionally minor exceptions were captured before internment, it was a policy driven by racism and a wish of the security services to expand their power, influence and budgets.

Now, everyone knows about American culture. They know about Republicans and Democrats, about the over-the-top politicians and news stations, about the mass advertising and consumerism. American culture has been exported all over the world, through movies and TV programs and political influence, so people recognise the satire.

Coutinho is not too sound defensively. With Swansea pressing us against the so-called wall, there was nothing we could do unless we pressed ourselves higher up the field. We didn't do it. We did not do it against Villa in the second half, neither against Manchester United in the second half and now again, again in the second half. With us sitting deep, Coutinho becomes ineffective since he dictates the tempo of our play and all our attacks go through him. We didn't attack anymore in the second half, we were not able to pin several passes together and work the ball out of our half. 

And this is what baffles me the most: why does Rodgers keep playing so defensively in the second half? Is it because he fears that we will surrender our slim lead when we press high up? Is he not confident our backline can play the highline (somewhat understandable with Skrtel but with him in our team last season, we played much better than in these second halves this season).

Credit to Osman for good defending as well.

It feels to good have options in the middle that can be used in different combinations. Fellaini was a must-play every week, but now with a rotation of McCarthy, Barry, Osman, Barkley, and Gibson the manager can configure a midfield that best suits the opponent or game situation. 

The possession-based play (even though it didn't really happen this week) negates the need for the big holding man up top, so no loss there, though apparently Kone has this skill; I don't know enough about Lukaku.

&gt; A Tory government.

No.

Just ""a government"", doesn't matter who is the majority.  
A government is just like a private business except they can make laws, wage wars and the shareholders are ""the people"".

&gt; Some aspects of this bill even bear remarkable similarities to what was dubbed the ""Abolition of Parliament Bill"" - a bill introduced in 2006 by then Labour Minister Jim Murphy MP but heavily watered down after widespread outcry, including by the Liberal Democrat party conference. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_and_Regulatory_Reform_Act_2006

&gt; The Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 (c 51) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It was enacted to replace the Regulatory Reform Act 2001 (RRA). The Act was and remains very controversial, because of a perception that it is an Enabling Act substantially removing the ancient British constitutional restriction on the Executive introducing and altering laws without assent or scrutiny by Parliament, and it has been called the ""Abolition of Parliament Act"".

This old act or the new one, will most likely lead to the ""secret courts"" which are becoming more detailed and known about in the USA. 

Unfortunately the UK people however, have less rights than they do when it comes to things like that.  
""The government"" have learnt from their ""mistakes"" from news being released from ""certain newspapers"", I wonder how quickly this will go through without interrupt.

And once it (or even a reduced version) does...

Sturridge threw his toys out of the pram, like he did at City before he moved to Chelsea. His appearances were littered with selfish shots-to-nothing, hogging the ball and trying to make headlines.

Marin was atrocious for us, I can't remember anything of note other than some poor performances, risky tackles and a failure to impress even against lower league opposition. He's playing well for Sevilla where he gets a lot longer on the ball, the tackles are much softer and the style of play suits his skill set. Not good enough for Chelsea

Thorgan Hazard? Clutching at straws there

Moses isn't good enough for Chelsea either when compared to the current squad, very wasteful in possession and while he helped fill a weak point in the squad, he wasn't going to become one of our star men.

Sturridge never really fit our play style it seemed. He was always too selfish whenever he got the ball. Yes he's a good striker and arguably better than Ba, but that transfer is at least understandable to an extent.

Marin is nowhere near close to the level of our current options in the attacking midfield. Seriously, would you play him above any of Mata, Hazard, Oscar, KDB, Schürlle, Willian, or Moses? He never would have seen playing time had he stayed.

Thorngan faces the same issues addressed above with Marin.

Courtois isn't going to be playing enough games with Cech still in the form he's in. It doesn't make sense to have him only play cup matches and the occasional EPL when he can play week in week out on loan. He needs playtime more than we need a backup keeper.

Moses faces the same problem as the other AM's addressed so far.^*

We have a metric fuck ton of young talented players who need regular playtime in order to keep developing. They can get that playtime on loan a lot more readily than they can here. We have great depth this season, and some pretty good talent as well, so I don't think we're really hurting for any of our loanees (and please don't bring up Lukaku and our strikers people. We've seen Eto'o in one game so far).

*Means that I personally don't agree with a loan/transfer. Lukaku, while I can understand the want for an experienced striker (Eto'o) and the need for Luka to get playing time, I really would have liked to see the kid get a chance.

benefit fraud costs x

Government spends 0.5x chasing against poor people who benefit fraud, legal fees, advertising, propaganda.

Government relies on a few other agencies, and charities to help people.

Government does not spend the 2x  as no one claims it.

There is an absolutely clear policy for our government to go after fraud first and not to help those who may be entitled. This anti-fraud policy it more important than helping unclaimed benefits. Demonising scroungers helps cut costs. 

Tax payers support this as spending more tax, giving more money to the government does not make economic sense. Demonising scroungers helps us pay less tax.

The whole 14 day period is when it is due. The last day is when businesses often choose to pay, but it is due from the moment the invoice arrives.   

&gt; typically businesses have to be a couple of months late before services are cut off   

That's a rather broad statement. For many digital services that isn't really the case. It is only really the case when businesses can get away with acting that way (e.g. when small claims court is the only recourse).    

As I said in another reply we cut off on the 31st day (or the 15th in this story). People then panic, call us, and pay. We then reinstate them within a few minutes.    

&gt; I have no idea what you do, but the average b2b invoice is paid well after the due date in the UK    

Not really. And many contracts allow interest to be collected after due.    

&gt; cutting people off after one day might be what you do but it certainly isn't the norm by a mile    

Depends on the type of contract and or services. I have no clue what is typical for a telephone company, but for many digital services it is very normal.

In the UK, and lots of other places, this went as far as banning every man who had ever had sex with a man since HIV emerged, and every woman who had had sex with a man who had had sex with a man.

Nowadays, the picture is a bit more complicated - in the rest of the UK, the ban now only covers men who have had sex with a man in the last year.  Some countries retain a complete ban, while others have got rid of it altogether.  There are a lot of factors to consider - MSMs do have higher rates of HIV and hepatitis, but you might expect the ones donating blood to be more health-conscious than average.  All blood is tested for various diseases, but the tests are not perfect - however, a positive test is a good thing (from a public health point of view) because you can inform the donor and get them treated, which will reduce the number of transmissions.  A genuine concern is that asking donors more detailed questions about their sex lives (so that someone who sleeps with a different person every night is excluded, but two guys who have been in a monogamous relationship for decades are not) might put people off donating.  And then you also have to consider the possibility that people might lie and donate blood even if they are ineligibile, as well as the stigmatising effect on gay and bi men.  It is a difficult question, especially since there is inevitably still at least some anti-LGBT prejudice among the people making the decisions.

Yes.  The various departments and people who caused the holes in the cheese to line up should be taken to task.   This is different to punishing them though; we need to know how and why all these little mistakes happened, what line of thinking led to that area getting it wrong and so on.

Then we as a society should endeavour to make sure those same mistakes can not happen again.

That's my main take on this as well - it's not about religion unless you *make it* about religion. Someone over on /r/unitedkingdom already pointed out that facial coverings are not so much religious as cultural anyway. 

That said - they've now removed the ban on burkas with a special caveat that iconic facial coverings are allowed.

My process:

Some flat letting places gather a bunch of applications, then make a decision. Others require a deposit of x, then run a background check and (more than likely) accept you. For the flats that gather all applications, as long as nothing is tragically wrong, apply for it, worst that can happen is you say you aren't interested. (Don't sign anything saying you automatically accept). For the ones that require a deposit, if you are happy with the flat, apply for it directly at the viewing otherwise someone else will most likely get to it first.

If so then it's not like a Niqab would be all that good for hiding your identity.

Fundamentally I've no problem with a man or woman wearing either same as you and your hypothetical balaclava.   I have issue if you were forced or felt you were being forced to wear it. 

I also have issue if when entering an area where your identity needs to be confirmed AND a private area is available for the check to be carried out if you refuse to remove it once in the private area and then complain that you have been refused entry.

But beyond that if you wish to walk around wearing an item of clothing then feel free to do so.  If you want to walk down the street as a ponygirl/boy or 'sissy maid' or some other fetishistic outfit that covers the genitals I am equally OK with that as well.

BBC emphasised the theft of the GTA V in this mugging, along with a big photo of the game cover. They're trying to link the two together in the readers' minds in a way in a way that suggests some sort of link between GTA V and crime.

You don't see them emphasising the other stolen items aside from a short mention of a watch and phone being stolen, both of which are surely more valuable than the game.

In short: they don't tell us anything that we _need_ to know.  Nor will an emergency text broadcast system.  Particularly in the UK:

But I'd say his general extension of Sturridge and Coutinho minutes past once they're obviously tired has suggested he has definitely been chasing another goal. 

I think its not that BR has the team changing tactics for the 2nd half with a lead, but that he has no adequate response to another side playing with reckless abandon. 

We've played against 3 solid but weaker PL sides, Utd, and Notts County, and against all of them, when they've needed a goal and have adapted their play, we've fallen off the map.

We have no way to alleviate the pressure because we so rarely have enough men near the half way line (while defending) to start a dangerous (versus inert) counterattack.

I think Moses, as he's integrated into the side, should change this. But its worrisome because when you look at the breakdown of our possession in these matches, its almost always in a pass to the middle that our small and weaker players (Coutinho and Aspas) cannot handle properly due to increased pressure and/or tired legs.

I do think Sturridge, despite winning a deserved PotM award and certainly being our main spark so far, has to come under some criticism for not picking out other players in attack. There were a few opportunities the other day where if he had made the right pass we might've gotten another 1-2 goals.

&gt;Something is religious if people claim it is

and although the article does go into the irreligious history of the veil it doesn't say anything about what makes something a religious article or not. It is in fact very difficult to define what counts as a religious symbol, from the Council of Europe's fact sheet on religious garments in a public space (2008):

&gt;What is a religious symbol?

&gt;There is no universal definition. There are different approaches to understanding religious symbols. One approach is to consider religious symbols as limited to figures of religious devotion, while another approach defines religious symbols as including everything which forms an element in the religious life of a believer. This may include, for example, forms of clothing, utensils, written materials, pictures, and buildings. The Court seems to favour a flexible approach whereby it is for the individual, rather than for the state or the Court itself, to determine whether something is, for them, a religious symbol. However, it is also made clear that this does not mean that it may not be subjected to restrictions.

Now I'm not saying I agree wholeheartedly with the European Court, but since we are talking about legislation their view point is relevant. I would say that even if something started out life as a political symbol, once someone adopts it as a religious symbol there is really no way to refute that it is (at least to them) sacred.

whether something is religious or not is a bit of a red herring though. I agree pretty much completely with the article you linked to, the veil is a symbol of oppression and it seems likely that people are fooling them selves when they claim it as 'fashionable' or 'empowering', however I think it is unethical and condescending to legislate on how people dress in a public space when that dress is causing no harm to themselves or people around them.

The counter assumption is that it is the governments responsibility to help individuals get what they are entitled to.

I explained how the current assumption makes sense within the context of the current individualistic Conservative politics (edits- it's probably the same with Labour too to be honest) and makes sense to a tax payer. I explained how the government and tax payers take this assumption and turn it into policy - to instead go after the poor and the benefit thiefs.

There is a counter assumption that governments should help those in need.

We assume that the government should be responsible with our money correct? I think we all agree that this is true, right?

So we can have two aims for being responsible - to save tax payers money and to spend it correctly. The current standing of almost all politicians left and right and the public in general is that they should spend less tax and not bother about spending it correctly. Thus we have the situation where it is considered not the governments job to help those in need, but to blame those in need if they fail to achieve help on their own.

And now, to top it all off, they want to know the exact times you're clocking in and out so that if you turn up 5 minutes late (which when you're working autonomously, in the middle of the night, makes no difference to anyone, as long as the work is done) they have an excuse to fire you whenever the hell they want.

Failing this, you need to look at a copy of his birth certificate, (you will have to pay for this) and take a careful note of his father and mother's names and dates of birth. To be sure you get the right person, if you don't know his date of birth, find his marriage certificate to your grandmother to get it. (Again, available online if it took place in the UK, or they were resident here.)

Look for other people's records who have the same parents as your grandfather, and look at their records. Get every bit of information off them you can. Sometimes you have to go a generation further back to find relatives, but our records contain a lot that will help you. If you find he had siblings, look for their marriage certificates and their children.

Also look for subsequent marriages for your grandfather and then any further children, who may still be in contact with him.

If you have the lead with 30 minutes to go, pulling back and defending a bit is appropriate. Furthermore, it should have been 3-2, with Sturridge scoring a brace.

However, I think Rodgers is going to this too soon. He essentially starts the 2nd half by defending in his own half, and that puts the squad under enormous pressure come the end of the game. By pressing early in the half, trying to get another goal, and hopefully keeping the opposition on their back foot, BR might keep the momentum until 60', then start to lay off. Pulling back also prevents us from utilizing Moses' and Sturridge's ability to hold the ball up, allowing us to recover and move upfield. Their runs seem unsupported, and just pull them out of position, as nobody moves forward to attack.

It's perfectly understandable that Englishmen might see Scottish Independence as a non-issue in these times of recession, Middle Eastern conflicts, and a globally warmed society. But to the Scots it's about pride and being self-sufficient. 

Going by all this, Salmond has a lot more political 'points' to make in this issue, because, as of right now, I wouldn't think Scottish Independence is a primary concern throughout the rest of Britain - meaning Cameron really won't have many people to appeal to if he writes a passionate and persuasive argument against independence.

Aside from the questionable morals regarding keeping every employees fingerprints on file so that information can be used or abused in dozens of other ways, the real issue here is the inherent ignorance of people when it comes to security.

Biometric security is a fallacy. It is inherently flawed because of its immutability. I will cite my favourite example. Take your standard card and pin identification setup. If you lose your card or it is stolen it is easy to cancel it and get it replaced. If you forget/lose your pin, you can change that and replace it. But if your biometric data is stolen or compromised, just what exactly can you do about it? You are stuffed. You cannot change your fingerprints, retina, dna etc.. and so your authentication is permanently compromised.

Biometric security should NEVER be used as a sole form of authentication and you should never trust it to secure  data without at least 2 other forms of authentication. Something you know and something you possess. The something you are, is the default for everyone and should be treated as the least secure, not the most.

I know the unions are probably not thinking this way but as an engineer I loathe the misunderstanding people have with it comes to biometric effectiveness.

1.Caves of Androzani-Powerful, in a way that Davison's stories had been lacking for a while up until this season

2.Planet of The Spiders-A distillation of everything Pertwee. He's bold, he's charming, and it's hearbreaking to see him put on a brave face as he dies. Watching it after Liz Sladen died has made me cry.

3.The War Games-Climactic! Troughton at his best as he seems torn apart by circumstances beyond his control. My only problem is that it's so hard to find the time to enjoy it as a single story.

4.Logopolis-The Doctor teaming with the Master? Incredible! Unheard of! And yet The Fourth Doctor did it and paid the ultimate price for it. Tom Baker sends ff his best performance all season(even if the companions are rubbish and the story's a long like of fluff)

5.The Tenth Planet-Oh if only the fourth episode weren't missing! The Cybermen are better here than they EVER have been in New Who, and isn't that just great? Love this story, and find the missing episode tragic.

6.The Parting of Ways/Bad Wolf-My my, what a lot this episode had to do. Eccleston is brilliant, but how disappointing are the Daleks, gone from personal destruction machines in Dalek to plain out stupid. The rose subplot drags and makes no sense until the random plot twist to make it work(and the doctor has a fast return switch in the console! how's that not being used?). I don't even mind the cheesy one liner before the kiss, but there's so much wrong with the story of this one, which leads me to...

7.Doctor Who-While it's a tough sell, it's still so funny to me to watch McCoy, the doctor with a million plans, get killed because of a Timing Malfunction that for once sends him into the worst plausible circumstances and sends him into events beyond his control. In some way that's fitting on an ironic level.

8.The End of Time- ""I don't want to go!"" Honestly, get the heck out! The final act of this drags on too freaking long, the implausible jump and lightning shocks mixed with the radiation poisoning should have killed him ages ago, and to be honest I ""HATE"" that final line.With that, Ten died in a convoluted way that was such a dragged out disappointment that it's the only time in the show's history I was glad to see anyone go.

9.Time and The Rani-All this had to do to rank above The End of Time was be competent. It not only couldn't do that, but it involved The Rani, the only Doctor Who villain to be worse than the thing from Love and Monsters.

To do so would remind me of those ultra-feminists who wanted strip clubs outlawed because they were ""degrading"", in their eyes. They didn't care that the vast majority of the girls did it voluntarily, and got a sense of empowerment from it. Nope, they saw it as a symbol, and felt the need to ban it. At no stage did they get the irony that they, apparently ""feminists"" were demanding laws telling other women what they can or cannot do with their bodies, based on their own opinions. They had willingly become the oppressor. They weren't trying to stop the oppression of these women, they simply wanted to call the shots instead. 

Regardless of my own opinions on the dress, it's not on me to demand the law tell others what they can wear.

true,white19lotus,lfc68,,"I thought he played great for what lead to his selection: coming in last day of transfer, agger getting a knock and having to play a full match away with skrtel who hadn't even secured his own place on the first team yet, going 3/3 with every other club wanting to knock you off that pirch. 

What I liked was that he clearly didn't look scared to pass it out of the back instead of just clearing it. I won't mind the heart attacks just as long as it works. He looks like a monster out there and for his age, I am excited for our future in the back. 

As for his 'mistakes' the first goal, granted shelvey's wiff at the ball was unexpected, gerrard didn't really do much from the follow up. Skrtel made a good block and was unlucky for it to fall back to shelvey. As for the second goal, sahko stepped up too far yes, but not entirely his fault. Which one of our midfielders was suppose to step up so that sahko could stay in his position? Honest question. 

Bottom line we didn't play great all around. Not even offensively in the first half. Yes we had a couple of great chances, but we lucked out by two shelvey mistakes. The only other clear scoring opportunity i remember was moses cross to a saved sturridge header. 

Besides that, we sucked down the right flank (where we miss johnson and suarez). We didn't field our best squad in the first place given that glen, luis, and daniel (and later philippe) were missing.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"&gt; ""... Always wanting to go to war""

I hear this a lot in the independence threads. It baffles me for several reasons;

* Firstly because the Iraq war was singularly unpopular - not just in Scotland, but across the whole of the UK, most of Europe and now even north America. I've gotten over it, you should to. The case for the war was pretty thin, but it's done now and in the past. Ultimately it cost George Bush and Tony Blair their governments, so in a sense democracy works.

* The only other ""wars"" in recent memory are the Falklands - a pretty justifiable war if ever there was one, the 1998 Kosovo conflict where early intervention pushed for by Tony Blair saved the lives of thousands of European Muslims and was probably one of the biggest foreign policy achievements of his time in power. The 2000 Sierra Leone conflict which was very small in scope, but never the less helped constrain what could have turned into a genocidal civil war. The brief period of action of Libya last year, the effectiveness of which remains to be seen and of course Afghanistan, which has had mixed results.

To an extent the UK **is** militaristic simply by virtue of our past and present situation. But actually in the last 50 odd years with the exceptions of the Troubles (where lets face it, nobody can claim a moral victory) and Iraq we should actually all be fairly proud of our military interventions, ranging from the Korean war right up to now (and tactfully avoiding Vietnam).",0,1379440148,null,0,false,0,cca7zt6,t3_1mktag,t1_cca7zt6,t1_cca74q5,null,1429431555,22,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,22

My point is that ""world class"", at least in the way I've heard it and used it, means basically a step above everyone else. A world class player is almost always a house hold name because of the hype that surrounds them. Personally, I probably couldn't name more than 5 strikers in the Bundesliga.

IMO, A world class player is a player who could walk into any team in the world and instantly be a starter in their position. Usually, at least by my interpretation on the word, there are only ever a hand full, at most, of world class players for each position. 

For example, in the Premier League, I would currently only say there were maybe 3 world class strikers: RVP, Suarez, and Rooney (although I would say he is teetering on the line because his form hasn't been great and he no longer plays as an out and out striker).

Unless you have a different definition for world class (if you do I would love to hear your take on it) I think that your claim is a bit naive, or it is at least hyperbole.

&gt;I agree pretty much completely with the article you linked to, the veil is a symbol of oppression and it seems likely that people are fooling them selves when they claim it as 'fashionable' or 'empowering'

we agree on this yes.

&gt;I think it is unethical and condescending to legislate on how people dress in a public space when that dress is causing no harm to themselves or people around them. Why do you think there should be a law in place?

I agree the religion thing is a red herring masking the true reason for them. I feel that using this get out of jail free card religion likes to think it has in a court of law and a university as equally unethical and and condescending. 

how else do we address the court issue other than legislation ? and how else do we combat oppression and blatant misogyny other than again legislation. especially when the religion card is played to claim discrimination and on closer inspection there is no basis for it in that religion...

The only problem with watching them all in order is that many of the First and Second Doctor episodes are missing. All the audio still exists and they all have recons (which I don't recommend as I feel they lose to much from losing the visual, especially with The Second Doctor) and some have animated versions, which have been/will be released on DVD. I haven't seen them, since they are all ones I watched recons of.

I would recommend skipping the missing ones unless you want to buy the dvds, except for Tenth Planet, which is only missing one ep and is a must watch. If you want to try the recons, go for Daleks Master Plan, which is 12 episodes long, and missing a lot of them but is worth watching.

David Cameron is then going to be forced to answer:

And the nature of Scots patriotism is such that a pompous looking upper middle class Englishman appearing to talk Scotland down will rally people to Salmond - regardless of the fact that what he is saying may not be a complete picture of the risks and potential rewards. Especially considering that Salmond is a potent public speaker.

Above all else - why should Salmond, the chief of a regional parliament demand that David Cameron, prime minister of the entire land, go to Scotland, on Scotlands national day, and *parlay* on equal terms? If, as Salmond claims, the arguments for independence are so strong then he shouldn't need David Camerons opposition to sell the idea to the Scottish public.

Consider also Camerons past experience of televised debates and ""*Cleggmania*""... I very much doubt he wants to put himself on an equal footing with a man who is effectively junior to him - let alone on a stage defined by Salmond. Cameron has also said in the past that independence isn't about him - its about what Scotland wants, and he isn't Scottish.

Putting in place plans now for the 3000 odd joint organisations (from the BBC to the NHS) only stands to help the seperatists - firstly by giving the impression that seperation is likely and secondly by potentially predjudicing the rUK bargaining position later on. At the end of the day, a post independence Scotland will be 5 million people bartering for seperation with 55 million people (probably feeling rather 'gipped') in the rUK... not to mention people like the USA/NATO, the EU etc. who all have their own agendas, many of which will effectively favour maintaining as much of the status quo as possible.

A good example is the trident nuclear missile system facility on the clyde... although Salmond may portray this as an objective ti will be very hard to achieve - particularly within the timescale he has set. Not least because the cost of relocating it will be so expensive that the rUK won't be able to afford it, so forcing them to move it within 3-5 years would be tantamount to forcing the rUK to unilaterally disarm. Now the USA/NATO alliance isn't going to take that very well, and you can bet they will apply just about every bit of diplomatic, economic and political pressure on the new iScotland government to allow the rUK to maintain the facility at least for the time being, perhaps with concessions like opening it up over the next 10 years to be a joint base - perhaps like the anglo-spanish NATO base on Gibraltar.

Therefore it is not on David Cameron to get on the train up to Scotland, on Scotlands national day to defend something he has already said isn't about him.

The problem with Linux adoption in businesses is, fundamentally, people like me.  I may be the only SysAdmin onsite and dealing with hundreds of users, as much as I prefer using Linux and FOSS based technologies I do not have the time to mess around with half baked frontends to LDAP, manually edit config files or such.

I can dive in to Active Directory, move users, change permissions, ACL's and the like quickly, easily and have that change replicate out near instantly to the user with an issue. 

We've spent so much time focusing on 'the desktop' and user impression that we've lost sight of what SysAdmins actually need and use in their day to day activities.

true,Red_Vancha,eng-hertfordshire,Robert Peel ftw,"&gt; In October 2012, the Scottish National Party promised that “an independent Scottish government led by the SNP will commit to an annual defence budget of £2.5 billion”. But how much could that actually buy? It is, after all, significantly less than the £3.3 billion that Scotland now contributes to Britain’s defence spending

Moot point really. Some of that £3.3 billion will be spent on defence outside of Scotland, i.e. contributing to the patrol of the UK, or being spent on trident for Britain. If they leave the Union, I'm fairly sure the defence will cost less, seeing as Scotland doesn't have to cover for the whole of the Union aswell. 

&gt; They are very unlikely to be in the market for large warships, modern combat aircraft and so on, because of the considerable costs 

Why would they anyway? They know England already has all of these, so the responsibility lies with England for foreign conflicts. If Scotland was in an emergency, England would no doubt come to Scotland's aid anyway.

&gt; Alex Salmond insists that it is “inconceivable that an independent nation of 5,250,000 people would tolerate the continued presence of weapons of mass destruction on its soil”. But this is inconsistent with the SNP’s new plan to become a member of Nato: why would a nuclear alliance accept a new member so openly opposed to such weapons?

Just because they don't have nuclear weapons doesn't mean they condone using. They won't like them being used, but in certain situations they'll accept that they're use is justified. And many EU/NATO states have no nuclear weapons. The Scandinavian countries, for a start.

That being the case I don't really think the burden of proof was on /u/KarmaAndLies, they had defined their terms pretty clearly

&gt;Something is religious if people claim it is

and made it so it was pretty much axiomatic, in other words if you disagree with that then you should present your definition of a religious artefact and why you think it's any better, I don't think anyone is obliged to prove anything on that point. 

But anyway we've agreed that it is sort of a moot point as religious items don't deserve special treatment.

&gt;I agree the religion thing is a red herring masking the true reason for them. 

This isn't quite what I meant. When referring to the religious aspect as a red herring I mean specifically a red herring in the argument about legislation as it leads to the idea that freedom to practice religion should be given more leeway that the freedom to dress as a big black ghost

&gt;I feel that using this get out of jail free card religion likes to think it has in a court of law and a university as equally unethical and and condescending.

Yes we agree on this and it is why I think the debate should be framed in terms of freedom to wear chosen clothing and should get no other special treatment, equally it should not be restricted any more than say a Halloween mask or a closed motorbike helmet.

Because if someone has said they've decided to wear it, there is no way you or anyone can climb into their heads and say ""oh no dear, you didn't choose, you only think you chose"" because in the end what the difference?

You can tell them that you think it is oppressive, misogynistic and un-stylish (all things we agree on) but in the end if they say back to you ""oh it's none of those things to me"" then you are pretty much left with no reply and trying to make it law that they share your views is somewhat unethical.

&gt;how else do we address the court issue other than legislation ? 

The court should just have a flat out rule about face coverings, I would be happy for that to be the case and this was addressed in /u/KarmaAndLies initial comment:

&gt;Where common sense dictates it, yes.
Court cases (e.g. giving evidence).
Police stations (e.g. when someone is arrested).
Entering the country (e.g. passport checks).
Anywhere else where identification is needed (e.g. taking an exam, buying alcohol/ciggies, getting into a 21+ club, etc).

and is something I had meant to say I agreed with earlier but I guess I forgot to, my bad.

&gt;and how else do we combat oppression and blatant misogyny other than again legislation. especially when the religion card is played to claim discrimination and on closer inspection there is no basis for it in that religion...

You legislate against misogyny by making men and women equal in the eyes of the law, for example men are not allowed to force women to wear veils. The oppression is far from blatant, I mean if someone swears that they were not forced to wear a veil, that it was their own choice for their own reasons (even if those reasons are stupid and self defeating), then the oppression is hardly even evident let alone blatant.

What may well hold true is that populations with a greater consciousness of politics and foreign affairs are less tolerant of policies and laws that they don't approve of. Therefore, it may be harder to get away with unpopular policies in such a nation. Nations with recent histories of independence, for instance, may well host populations like this. It's not their size, it's the general interest in who is running the country and how they're doing it - something which declines in older, more entrenched countries such as the UK.

true,7zark77,eng-GreaterLondon,London,"Mmm, no ... I think you'll find the oil companies which drill for that oil will be getting a fair chunk of that 100%. The idea that Scotland will turn into Saudi Arabia, with the majority of oil revenues going straight to the government, is wrong. There's also no guarantee that Scotland will get all the contracts to process that oil. It can easily be shipped to England or Norway. 

Most importantly, who has said Scotland is going to get all the oil? It's currently owned by the UK government, but it's another line peddled by the pro-independent crowd, that it will all be Scotland's despite there being no commitment from Westminster as to what will happen. Scotland has no effective maritime boundaries, and even if you draw a continued line of the Scotland/England border, it would give England a large chunk of the oil fields. 

Finally, while pro-indepence voters focus on the wealth they might inherit, they forget that  Scotland will also be handed a share in the UK's debt, which is not small. ",0,1379447789,null,0,1379448431,0,ccaaw86,t3_1mktag,t1_ccaaw86,t1_ccaapin,null,1429430190,32,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,32

true,demostravius,eng-Surrey,Surrey,"It's a game. Cities in the US have tonnes of traffic as well but in the games they just thin it down.

Making a London game would be easy, you have a very interesting layout, far more so than the grids of the US. Gun shops can be tucked away in underground gang hideouts and there are loads of landmarks spread across the UK you can throw into one city. The UK has loads of military bases with top of the line tanks and weaponry (not to mention air craft, helicopters and lots of rivers for boats).

The heavy satirical things would be London busses, post boxes, telephone boxes, police cars and so on. You might be joking but I am not sure, why would speed cameras be in the game? Or congestions and parking?

Roundabouts would be an interesting addition and we have plenty of chain restaurants (didn't play GTA IV, they still have the eating thing?). Hell you could put security cameras everywhere so police keep finding you, have street criminals that enjoy head-butting and stabbing you, or else use knuckle dusters.
