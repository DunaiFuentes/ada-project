1. Registering as self-employed with HMRC: [The latest you should register is by 5 October after the end of the tax year for which you need a tax return.](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/sa/register.htm#2)  So if you start freelancing now, i.e. 2012/13 tax year, you need to register no later than 5 october 2013.  It's probably best to do it as early as possible.   
2.  [See here for what an invoice needs to include.](https://www.gov.uk/invoicing-and-taking-payment-from-customers/invoices-what-they-must-include). You need a unique ID number.  I just started from 0001 and started counting upwards.  Some people I know like to include a year ID, so 12-001 for invoices issued in 2012 etc.  As long as it is unique for each invoice, what method you use is up to you.  I would also recommend putting a payment due date on there.
3.  Records: Depending on how complex your expenditure and incomings are, Excel is honestly a good bet.  I keep track of every job, with dates, value, invoice no. contact person, rates charged etc. in one sheet. I have another with all my expenses, and a third with client details, such as contact details, currency, payment terms, rates etc.  I use a Word template to create invoices.  Not the most efficient, but I only create about 5 or 6 invoices per month.
4.  Put money aside from every payment you receive.  Expect to be paying 20% tax and 9% Class 4 national insurance.  You'll also have to pay Class 2 national insurance, but that's about £160 per quarter.
5.  Actually paying the taxman.  Be aware, that your first tax payment will be 100% of your tax due from 2012/13 PLUS 50% of the following year's estimated tax and will be due end January after you file your first return.  So your return for 2012/13 will be filed after April 2013, and payment will be due end January 2014.

true,iloverubicon,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"Self defense has no specifics against minors or adults. 
You would defend yourself using reasonable force under common law to do so. The self defense has to be immediate, and has to be reasonable. Any act you do cannot be planned, ie, wait around a corner and jump them. 
But if they punched you and you pushed them/punched them off of you, you are in the right. 

If in court, they said, ""look, in the video you can clearly see we were jumped, we ran to the nearest place of safety (the cinema, hopefully there would be cctv there too) and they further took our wallets and punched me twice, so to defend myself I punched and kicked whatever was closest"".
Especially with video/cctv you'd be protected. Being young is not an excuse. Being able to prove your actions were reasonable and lawful is the important part.

It's one of the laws police officers use to protect themselves, as it covers all persons in the country, but the police have other laws to use when they need to act in an arrest or for prevention of crime etc. 

If these brats are 8, they're below the legal age of responsibility so cannot be prosecuted as a criminal.

You are free to do these things as if you were doing them in your own country (this is how the EU works).

Employers are required to verify that their employees have the right to work in the UK. There's no formal government requirement for you to have documentation. Often a passport photocopy is enough.

You may also apply for a [registration certificate] (http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/eucitizens/documents-eea-nationals/) which is basically just the UK government confirming you're an EEC national. This may be the permission people want from you.

In any other way, the law states that you as an EEC national can't be treated differently from a UK national. Once you've proven to a prospective employer that you're Swedish, that's all the extra work you have to do.

When we were first getting serious, he recorded a CD for me, with two songs that he'd written on his guitar. Then he recorded a message, and although I'd have to dig it out to quote it exactly, he said that he had fallen in love with my love of Python, because he loved that a girl could be so open about loving something that is considered geeky and that I wasn't just saying that I loved something because it was accepted. Then he said he hoped that we'd have lots of years together so that I could take the time to show him why I loved the show so much.

I think that acceptance of each other's interest can be just as important as sharing each other's interests.

But that said, other than the banks and various opening hours being retarded it's not so bad.

I've probably seen more of Germany than England which is strange but then I travelled a lot when I was there - I'd certainly work there if the opportunity arose :P

After travelling across Berlin everyday for work for 3 months on a rail pass that cost me 50 euro a month and then coming back to England and spending that much just to visit my mother by rail... ugh... and the rent is generally cheaper too.

Pertinent bit:
&gt;Moutinho, unfortunately, won't be signed in January unless things change dramatically. Andre loves him, as you know, but Porto won't sell. Also I think Dembele has developed a superb partnership with Sandro so the pressing case for Moutinho isn't quite what it was. If Spurs get into the Champions League then I think they will go back for him. He has a very close bond with AVB and I think Spurs would have a good chance of getting him. They were so close in August..  If they sign anyone big in January then I believe it will be Damiao. Spurs like him and have had two previous offers turned down and since AVB has arrived he has made it clear he would like him also. The player, I also believe, would now like to come. Spurs would pay £15m - Internacional have previously insisted, after saying that was the price, that they want £20m. It's a very hard deal to do and my gut feeling is it won't happen now.

I think due to these conditions, the media wrote their own headlines, although I do believe AVB wanted Moutinho.  Only the management staff of the club know what really went down.

Now we have Dembele playing as a CM playmaker, Moutinho is less of a must-buy.

That's why teams come to the Lane and park the bus, because it gets rid of the best part of our game.

true,lsusobeast,lfcflame,,"&gt;IMO he's more mobile than Alonso.

Xabi is also an all-world player. His intelligence of the game makes up for any athletic deficiencies. 

&gt;Also, Xavi's not lazy

Definitely didn't mean it like that. I meant their style of play is similar: relying on positioning and intelligence rather than athletic ability to make plays. Calm and composed on the ball with a high passing range. 

&gt;It's not great, but IMO that's a combination of two things:

""Astounding"" was used as a synonym for ""impressive"" in that sentence. I was complementing him. 

&gt;The minutes per tackle rate is a good point, and I can see why that suggests he's lazy

It actually doesn't suggest that. IIRC his tackle percentage is very high. It just shows what kind of defender he is: positions himself excellently and goes in for high percentage tackles. He would be excellent in a system like United's, but his motor just isn't enough for what is expected of our midfielders. 

&gt;It'll just be a shame, and a waste of a good player.

Agreed. He is a good player and has something to offer in the future once Gerrard retires. I just don't think we can afford to keep him until then. I fancy Jordan Henderson to step up instead. I think he is a fantastic player. 

&gt;because Rodgers may play Suarez as a #10 for the rest of this season and then go buy a #10 in the summer anyway and put Suarez on the flanks

Hopefully he is moved to the #10 permanently. Sterling, Sturridge, Suarez will allow us to finish the season. In the summer I hope we can bring in a player similar to Walcott. That would give us an absolutely fantastic front line. The possibilities are endless.

true,muunflower,null,null,"My SO and I like steak and ale pie, it's how we first met. One day I decided I wanted to make it instead of going to the pub and I found [a recipe](http://www.therecipechef.co.uk/index.php?p=1_138_Steak-and-Ale-Pie) online and bookmarked it (yes the website does look a bit dodgy) The process is so time consuming, I usually can't be bothered to go through so much effort but I do this on special occasions.

Steak and Ale Pie

Serves 3-4

Ingredients

400g diced steak (skirt or braising steak is great or even Brisket diced in to 2 cm chunks)

1 can bitter (not cream flow)

1 pack of shop bought Puff Pastry

1 white onion

100g chestnut mushrooms

1 tablespoon of plain flour

1 tablespoon of Worchester sauce

1 teaspoon of thyme

1 tablespoon of olive oil

Salt and pepper

1 egg

 

Method

-          The pie has to be made in two sections, the pie filling, then assembling the pie.
-          To make the pie heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large pan with a lid.
-          Peel and slice the onion into thick slices and halve the mushrooms. Place in the pan and cook for 5 minutes until the onion begins to soften and caramelise.
-          Remove the onion and mushrooms from the pan and place in a bowl to one side.
-          Toss the diced steak (2cm chunks) in 1 table spoon of plain flour that has been seasoned with salt and pepper. A freezer bag is great for doing this in.
-          Add the meat to the hot pan adding a little more oil if needed. Cook for 5 minutes so that the meat starts to brown and caramelize on the edges.
-          Return the onions and mushrooms to the pan and give the mixture a good stir.
-          Add 1 teaspoon of thyme and 1 table spoon of Worchester sauce and cook for 30 seconds. Add 1 can of bitter and give the mixture a good stir. It is important to use bitter that is not creamflow. If you can, try to buy a cask conditioned ale. These can be bought in bottles from most supermarkets.
-          Bring to the boil and reduce to a simmer. Place a lid on the pan and cook for 2 ½ hours occasionally stirring.
-          The secret to a good pie filling is that is not too wet as this will make the pastry soggy. Your filling should be dry but with enough gravy to keep the pie moist.
-          Remove from the heat and allow to cool down. I like to make the filling the day before and store it in an airtight container in the fridge to allow the flavours to develop.
-          To assemble the pie, take your block of puff pastry and cut off 2/3rds.
-          Roll out to 2-3mm thick and line a pie tin or bowl with the pastry.
-          Add the filling to the pastry and spread evenly.
-          Roll out the rest of the pastry to around the same thickness and big enough that it covers the pie.
-          Brush the edges with beaten egg and place the pastry over to make a lid.
-          Press the edges with either your thumb or fork and pierce a hole in the centre to allow any steam to escape. Wash the lid with the remaining beaten egg.
-          Trim off any excess pastry and place in the fridge for 20 minutes to allow the pastry to relax.
-          Cook in a pre heated oven gas mark 5/180C on a low shelf for 40-45 minutes until golden brown and the gravy is bubbling through the hole in the pie lid.
-          Serve with either chips, mash or baby new potatoes and a selection of fresh vegetables.",0,1357684556,null,0,false,0,c7tgfwp,t3_167e2v,t1_c7tgfwp,t3_167e2v,null,1430899003,6,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,6

I would say it's quite naive to think his motives at that time were non-specific and the contract was a serendipitous outcome, Peter Kenyon did what he could but the club gave in and offered him the greatly improved deal. As for the AVB situation, it's one thing to do what is best for the team but undermining the manager to the media isn't part of such a plan. He could have handled the situation far better, Terry probably had more to lose from AVB's tactics yet stood behind the manager

I don't know anything about the contract negotiations, or lack thereof, between the club and Frank, nobody can say they do honestly. The quotes and allusions being made in the media are orchestrated bits of PR that are part of the game, which is why I never put any faith in them

You're right about Benitez being in the frame for a while, longer than most people would believe but that is something I cannot talk about here. He was first approached when AVB was sacked but didn't want to come in at such a late stage. RDM was never the popular choice but Bruce Buck backed him to the hilt and was key in his eventual hiring. Results, performances and decisions made were questionable and the suspicion that Di Matteo wasn't ready didn't take long to confirm. Yes he did win the Champions League but I would credit that mostly to the team in general with some extraordinary performances from individuals. The facts about RDM's stint this season are that he oversaw the worst Champions League campaign of the Roman era, relied too heavily on playing Mata/Hazard/Oscar in every game while doing little to integrate Moses and he couldn't organise the back line so we ended up conceding far too many goals. Benitez has tightened up the back line, found a new lease of life for David Luiz, turned Moses in to a regular starter while rotating the attacking options and has produced results. We've had the QPR defeat and the poor showing in the CWC Final but those aside, he's doing well.

true,iceschade,tennant,Tennant,"Alright, since you continue to argue, I'll lay this all out for you. Here are your claims:

&gt; ""FYI - We look at a computer without ever blinking.""

&gt; ""Blinking isn't automatic. It does happen, but if your pupil is constantly adjusting .... you will not blink. Adjustments = Blink Over Ride.  Staring at a computer monitor = no blink or minimally you drop 50% of your blinking capacity.  But if you, especially use older monitors ... you will not blink as long as you stare at the screen.""

&gt; ""If you stared at your computer long enough .... you will not blink. But we do, because we aren't 100% staring at our computer screens.  When we look away to the keyboard, a different section of the screen, and so on ... then we blink.""

First, I would like to start by pointing out that you contradict yourself in your own words. You first state that ""if your pupils are constantly adjusting .... You will not blink."" Later, you say that we blink because ""we aren't 100% staring at our computer screens."" Originally you stated that we don't blink because our pupils are constantly adjusting when we stare at a computer screen. **This is absolutely false, on both counts.**

Your eyes adjust when you change focus from near to far. When you stare at a computer screen, your eyes *do not adjust* because they are constantly fixed at a single distance. This causes the eye to become tired from the strain of being fixed in a single adjustment for too long. **This information is found in the Scientific American article you cited.** If you had actually read closely, you would have understood this fact.

Second, blinking *is* automatic. It happens all the time without conscious input. Making adjustments actually encourages blinking, as stated in one of your cited articles, which is why they suggest looking around the room now and then.

Third, you did not cite any article that gave a quote of 50% like you stated. This figure seems to be entirely made up.

Fourth, you made a universal claim, ""We look at a computer without ever blinking."" This applies to everyone, not just a select few. Again this is false. In fact, the articles you cited actually contradict your own statement.

From [Scientific American](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=is-sitting-too-close-to-screen-making-you-blind):

&gt; ""But only a small—and mysterious—subset of people see myopic progression from near work, whether they are focusing on a computer or accounting books. ""We are not very clever in identifying who [is affected] yet,"" says James Sheedy, a professor at the Pacific University College of Optometry in Oregon.""

While the article does go on to say that focusing on things up close can reduce (but not stop) blinking (from 20 blinks per minute to ""as low as seven""), this does not mean that **all** people looking at computer screens stop blinking, nor does it mean that **all** people ""minimally drop 50% of their blinking capacity.""

In fact, it looks as if you got this completely backwards. When someone says ""as little as seven,"" that means that seven was the **lowest** number of blinks they measured, meaning that the average was actually higher than that. So you could say that **some** people lose **up to** 65% of their blinking capacity, but this is **very** different from the claim that **all** people drop a minimum of 50%.

Fifth, this eye strain is only caused by looking at things too up-close. If you have your computer sitting on your lap on the couch, you might be too close to your screen. But if you sit a reasonable distance from your computer screen, this won't affect you like it would if you were reading a book one foot from your face.

If you had claimed that looking at a computer screen can reduce the frequency of your blinks, then this could be a safe claim. But you claimed (without any supporting evidence) that ""We look at a computer without ever blinking."" This statement is absolutely false.

Both [Scientific American](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=is-sitting-too-close-to-screen-making-you-blind) and [Indian Express](http://www.indianexpress.com/news/computer-vision-syndrome-blink-and-give-relief-to-your-eyes/429642/0) agree that this happens to a small (but growing) subset of people in the world, and they both agree that it merely reduces (but doesn't eliminate) blinking. Both agree that it only happens when you look at a screen closely for too long, and that looking away (adjusting your eyes) helps resolve the problem. Neither one of these articles supports your claims.

Lastly, I feel it should be noted that [you attempted to cite EyeProtectorPro.com as a reputable source](http://www.eyeprotectorpro.com/rsirepetitive-strain-injury-explained-eyeprotectorpro/taking-breaks/), which I find to be somewhat amusing (and a little embarrassing). This website is a commercial site intended to **convince you to buy a product.** This site has no scientific backing, no hard evidence, and no actual weight whatsoever. (This would be the same as claiming that Snickers is the best candy bar because a Snickers advertisement told you so.)

So, in summary, you not only contradicted yourself with your own words (showing a significant lack of understanding on the topic), but you contradicted yourself with your own supposed ""evidence.""

He's very good defensively and when the team is defending, he's a great asset to stifling oppositions. Imagine a midfield 3 of Sandro Dembele and Moutinho. Great energy and creativity going forward but all 3 can defend when needed. When we come up against teams like man city, Utd and Chelsea, we won't get overrun in midfield like we do with a 4-4-2 formation. Also, Dembele, while great at breaking up play and set us on the offensive, he doesn't have that killer pass in him to release bale and Lennon down the wings, he's much better off trying to link up with the forward with his close control carrying the ball and drive us forward. So I don't know why people like we have players of the Moutinho ilk at our club already, because you dont find many players like him at many clubs. And that's why he's integral to the AVB plan. We can do without a ""proper"" striker if we play his 4-3-3 formation with Dempsey and Siggurdson filling in if we have no fit strikers.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"I'd prefer both Moutinho and a good striker but that seems out of the realm of possibility. 

I think our results have at times obscured some of the problems we have. We've been winning so it's difficult to argue against what we're doing but I think we can do even better with a 3rd midfielder. Neither of our strikers has been doing anything for the last month yet we're somehow still winning games convincingly. 

The natural response to that might be to buy a striker and I do think we need one badly, but a true playmaker who can get on the ball 70-80 times a game, control the tempo, switch the play, play incisive passes, etc would improve us dramatically. Moutinho is honestly an incredible player along those lines. I've always had my reservations about spending 25m on one player, but if we can get him a little lower than that I'm all over it. 

In my opinion there are 3 realistic scenarios this window.

1) We fork over silly money for Moutinho and buy a young striker for cheap cover, loan in a proven striker, or recall Kane. 

2) We fork over silly money for a striker and bring Holtby in early for 1.6m or w/e the figure was.

3) We do fuck all. 

I honestly don't know which of the first two I prefer, but at any rate I'd prefer 2 players in this window. I can convince myself I'd prefer the top striker, but then I watch [these](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbOTW3j8PiY) two [videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_XNLoBxmQw) and realize what we've missed so dearly.

true,sherrah,null,null,"I follow a fair bit of Ligue 1 and Montpellier, because who doesn't like following football? (I'm not a spurs fan, just chipping in) 

Last year Montpellier played a 4-3-3 or a 4-2-3-1 and they still play the same formation this year. last year 2011-2012 season Belhanda was outstanding, really helped the team get forward contributed immensely to the teams overall peformances and was one of the best midfielders in the league, which was why he was in the Team of the Year. Directly contributed last year with 4 assists and 12 goals (Was the penalty taker for Montpellier). At only 5'9"" he is stronger than most at that height but don't expect to be able to physically take the biggest destroyers such as Mulumbu. 

If we are going to look at this best position it is definetly as a CAM playing behind the striker allowing to use his impressive passing range and ability to pick holes through the defense. He can also play as a CM or even a CDM but in the past (talking about the 2010-2011 season) he wasn't as good as he is now. He has far to much attacking talent that could be used in the final third than being further back, this was noticed by René Girard who decided to move him further up which payed dividends for montpellier, and ended up winning the UNFP young player of the year award. He is a fantastic player and would be well suited to Spurs and the Premier League I feel, however I don't think you will get him during this transfer window as a summer move looks more likely because Montpellier aren't having a good season.

The local real pub in Headingley turns away students who want to come in , as there is no room for them. That would never have happened 20 or even 10 years ago.

 Yes it is expensive for certain things but after 10 years of living in London I really appreciated the room and closeness to nature - it's easy to find your own space. The pace of life is also a little slower compared to the UK, families and workers rights are carefully protected and holidays are practically sacred, I had 6 weeks vacation in Sweden! Pretty much everyone speaks a degree of English so very easy to get settled in although learning the language is encouraged (and rightly so IMHO) as by learning a smidgen of Swedish helped me immensely when travelling in Norway and Denmark

Taxes are high but salaries often reflect local cost of living. Rents can be ridiculously expensive, in Stockholm finding available property to rent was nigh on impossible unless you had the right contacts. Public transport is good in the cities and reasonably priced. 

It's not political nirvana though, like anywhere else there are scandals and outrages but in general the stance is left-of-centre and the gulf between rich and poor certainly felt closer compared to the UK.

true,TheDemonClown,tennant,Tennant,"Okay, first things first:  don't be *that* girlfriend.  You know, the one that *forces* her boyfriend to watch something that he absolutely cannot stand and is only putting up with to keep the peace.  While I understand that watching The Doctor is infinitely preferable to watching sparkly vampires, Kardashians or drunk Guidos, you're still *making him do something he does not want to*.  So don't do that, because I highly doubt you would appreciate it if he made you partake in something he liked that you couldn't stand.

You say that he hasn't given a good reason.  Well...what exactly does he say?  What does he not like about it?  *You* say it's not a good reason, but you're the biased party in this matter, so it would help us, the advice-givers, if we knew what his complaints are.  After all, the tone &amp; themes of the show vary wildly from actor to actor and even episode to episode.  If he doesn't like dark stuff, then you probably wouldn't want to start him on ""The End Of Time"" or ""Blink"".  So, enlighten us as to his actual beef.  Help me to help you.

Now, if he's literally just saying, ""Because I just don't wanna!"", then you can try pointing out that having no reason to not watch something means that he also has nothing to really lose by giving 1 episode a shot.  At most, he's out 45 minutes (if you're watching on Netflix or torrented vids or some other medium where commercials are edited out), which he probably would've wasted on [insert SO's preferred timesink, like WoW rep grinding, here] anyway.  By doing this, by *convincing* him with logical arguments rather than *forcing* him, you're giving him a choice.  When people feel that they have a choice in the matter, they will always approach the end result with a more open &amp; positive attitude than if they are shoehorned into it.  

So, even though you'll be persuading him by framing the show in a good light based on what his specific complaints are, you're ultimately still leaving it up to him.  Chances are, if you take this route, he'll agree to 1 episode and probably be hooked if he's into quality shows at all.  If he still declines, I'd say just respect his decision and realize that there are some battles you just can't win.  My roommate absolutely refuses to watch most sci-fi because ""space is dumb"", for example.  She literally will not listen to any argument or accept any proof to the contrary; space is always &amp; forever dumb.  So, after a while, I just stopped trying because it just kept resulting in an argument that went nowhere.

Now, as for what episode to start on...I'd suggest ""Rose"", simply because it's the beginning of the new series and, thus, isn't going to be one of those episodes where you have to keep pausing &amp; explaining a lot of stuff that came before.  Everything he needs to know - the TARDIS, the sonic screwdriver, the Doctor himself - is all handled throughout the episode via normal exposition.",0,1357697739,null,0,false,0,c7tkjp2,t3_165szu,t1_c7tkjp2,t3_165szu,null,1430900938,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0

Maybe it's because I'm American, but i don't understand the culture that insists on firing managers and getting rid of players any time they have a bad day.  I do realize that this is more than that, but I don't know what people expected of this season.   Should we go back to how we did things last year?  Play a bunch of old farts and hope for a draw?  If I hear one more person talk about ""experience"" or ""proven players"" I'm going to lose it.  Playing all ""proven players"" has been our problem for the past how many years.

Moutinho, Holtby, Belhanda, Sissoko; they're all real all-rounders like Dembele, and for my money Sigurdsson too (don't really agree with this No. 10 pigeonhole everyone seems so willing to strand him in). They're obviously not all the same player and each offers a slightly different balance of proficiencies, but in general they all offer high work rates and excellent ball winning, carrying and distribution abilities.

Why the big focus on Moutinho? He's the best of this bunch - he really is a complete midfielder, the finished article - and AVB already has a great relationship with him.

It seems pretty clear that we currently have a consistent policy of trying to bring together a dynamic group of midfielders who are each capable of carrying out multiple roles within our preferred formation. Personally I think we'll end up bringing Holtby over before the end of the month and then going balls out for Moutinho in the summer. Then we'll be starting next season with a central midfield three chosen from Sandro, Parker, Dembele, Moutinho, Holtby and Sigurdsson, at least two of whom could play further forward and wide if needed.

    Reina
    Wisdom, Skrtel, Agger, Johnson

    Suarez, Sturridge, Downing

otherwise:

    Reina
    Wisdom, Skrtel, Agger, Johnson
    Gerrard, Lucas
    Henderson
    Sterling, Suarez, Downing

I don't think Sturridge will start. If he did, I expect him to play through the middle, latching onto through balls like he did against Mansfield. His pace and ability to get behind the defence should present more one-on-one chances, which should significantly increase the goals/chances percentage. Suarez on the right should have more time on the ball as the defence now have Sturridge to consider and there should be less likelihood of him being marked by two players. Downing on the left is preferred because Sturridge can head the ball, with Suarez lurking at the far post, so I want to see Downing put crosses into the box instead of cutting in as he would if he was on the right.

Otherwise, it's Suarez up front as usual and why not when he's scoring too. I don't know which side Downing will play but either way, he's in because there's no alternative. Suso is too young for this kind of game. Sterling, despite his age will start because there needs to be somewhat with flair up front apart from Suarez. Last time we played Utd, Shelvey started in front of Gerrard and Allen, and I'd like to see Shelvey again in that position, but his form hasn't been great as of late and I'd rather see Henderson up front who can at least contribute defensively.

Man Utd's strikeforce is scary. If RVP and The Mexican starts, I think having 2-1 instead of 1-2 with Lucas and Gerrard in front of the Skrtel and Agger should provide more cover. The thing is, Man Utd are dangerous through the centre or from the flanks so I'm a little nervous about Agger or Skrtel being pulled out of position.

Whatever team BR selects, I just want to see Sturridge again.",0,1357701852,null,0,false,0,c7tltje,t3_166zys,t1_c7tltje,t3_166zys,null,1430901541,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

We have seen since O'Neil left, rash decisions, sackings hirings and firings and as many mangers as seasons since O'Neil, and it proves the sacking and panicing doesn't achieve anything. Its precisely why we are where we are. Lambert needs a little more time, stability and patience is must right now, a couple of additions in January will help, IT IS ONLY JANUARY 8TH PEOPLE WE DON'T NEED TO HAVE SIGNED EVERYONE RIGHT AWAY THERE IS STILL OVER 3 WEEKS OF THE MONTH AND WINDOW LEFT!

The injuries haven't helped, particularly because they have all appeared at the same time. To be honest I also think the likes of Ireland, N'Zogbia, Bent and Dunne just need to be got rid of, their demeanour around the Villa camp cant be good, the youngsters may not be getting the results we want but you can't deny that they are putting a shift in each and every game, how would you feel if that was you and there was an old head who would just wander around and sometimes show up and sometimes not.

It's like being the new guy at a place of employment and the older guys passing the buck and making the new guys do all the work while they just sail on grabbing a pay check.

rambling a little bit, but Villa forums far and wide are bashing Villa big time, at the end of the day fans need to realize as things stand Villa have had to change and adapt to an ever changing economic landscape, too many people are living in the past, I'm not admitting defeat but I have come to realize that the days of us competing with the likes on Man U Chelsea etc are long gone, we just dont have the backing and money to do so, would you rather us do what we are doing now or end up like a Portsmouth or Rangers?

true,Orbixx,eng-westmidlands,West Midlands,"Hey, interesting story! I'm planning to go to Japan for a year in spring through a working holiday visa and then look for a job with plans to stay longer. I've been for a month already last year, having lived with a Japanese friend's family and travelled the major cities of Honshu. Loved the place whilst I was there and not fancying the modern culture in the UK all that much recently, want to move there for an indefinite period. How did you do it?

I'm 22, just about to sell a business I've been running for 4 years providing Linux services and support to individual and businesses, I don't have a University qualification (quit after finishing the first year because it was a terrible course, lecturers with unintelligable accents, half pointless course subjects, unintentional programming mistakes made by lecturers in course materials), so that's quite possibly a significant setback for me in Japan for jobs depending on where I go - I can totally demonstrate my skill *once I get an interview*. Everything I know beyond GCSE is self-study, including 10 months of Japanese which probably has me currently at a safe JLPT N4, maybe an N3 if I got lucky.

Anyway, if you have any tips for me, they'd be very well received and much appreciated, or if you happen to know of any job openings, that would be wonderful too.

The Blue Jays won back to back world series' and now have the distinction of doing that and then not qualifying for the playoffs for 20 years thereafter.

Yes, the Argos just won the Grey Cup, but they were 9-9 in the regular season and the years before that finished 6-12, 9-9, 3-15, and 4-14.  Most Torontonians were happier about [Mayor Rob Ford doing this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNdlWox3CBs) than about the Grey Cup. And really, the CFL only has 8 teams and unless you live in the Prairies you probably don't care that much about it.

The Raptors flat out suck and no more really needs to be said.

TFC.... just, ugh.  Danny Koevermans said they were probably the worst team in the world last year and he wasn't far off.  Now they hired a ""manager"" who is still an active player and might not even start the job until his QPR contract expires.   Management has stated they're fine with him not being there for the MLS Draft, training camp, and the start of the season.  Top, top move.

All of this is just further made worse by the way the media covers most of these teams, as well as the way ownership runs them.  MLSE is one of the most valuable and profitable sports companies in the world, and Rogers (part owner of MLSE) also owns the Jays, and the Argos are owned by the Canadian Senator who also owns the BC Lions.  

Really, it's the same old sports franchises ran purely as profitable business rather than for fans, and in this way they are indeed 'successful.'  But man, is it a unique and infuriating situation for Toronto Sports Fans.

Also, alot of people are wondering where Holtby and the possible signing of Belhanda would work, well there are two answers. 

1) Squad Rotation, honestly you guys will make the Champions League bar a major screw up like last year, where you did make it but due to Chelsea actually winning (What the hell right?) it wasn't enough. For next season you will need squad rotation, Currently you have Sandro - Dembele as the double pivot, Sandro being the destroyer and Dembele linking up the play between defence and attack while also helping distribute the ball. If you need to defend a lead you then put Parker on for a double destroyer pivot of Sandro - Parker, outside of those two combinations you can play Livermore and thats about it (Please correct me). With Holtby you can play him deeper as he has before so a Double Pivot of Sandro - Holtby or Parker - Holtby (Which would be fantastic) allowing other players to get rest, less chance of injuries, if they are in crap form you can replace them for a few games etc. 

2) You need a deep lying playmaker, I think holtby will be your man here if you do sign Belhanda (on the basis that Belhanda is supremely better as a CAM) so your midfield three will be Sandro - Holtby - Belhanda which is both creative and defensive.

It is critical that your invoices not only carry your address, their name and address and how much it is, but also the date and a unique invoice number (usually sequential, I'm not sure if this is mandatory).

Assuming you're a sole trader: your invoice needs to carry your name. If you're a sole trader trading as ""Cool Videography"" then you need to state ""(A Archie, proprietor)."" (If you're a limited company then other rules apply).

Assuming you're not VAT registered (otherwise some other rules apply) I believe you need to state that.

There would be no advantage (and probably disadvantages) compared to filling out the immigration application forms at the Canadian government website.

It's been a while since I checked, but they used to have a points system, favouring graduates aged 25 - 35; certain professions are desired and get extra points, as does proficiency in spoken / written English and French.

If this is the case I can't imagine anything changing in this window, certainly not because the lad is in great form. Moyes isn't as knee jerk as that.

true,SEMW,null,null,"&gt; It's worth noting that the 'reasonable' test is actually subjective. i.e. If you can convince the Jury that in the heat of the moment, you thought it was reasonable force, then you can be granted Self-Defense.

Strictly that's not quite true. The force you use does have to be objectively reasonable. If it's disproportionate, it isn't reasonable, however much you might have thought it was.

The subjective bit comes in because that reasonableness is judged *in the circumstances as you believe them to be*. So e.g. if you convince the jury that you genuinely believed someone was trying to kill you, then stabbing them in self-defence will probably be seen as objectively reasonable (especially if you can convince them that it's what you ""honestly and instinctively thought was necessary"").

Gotta be honest here, there was a pub just like this about a five minute walk from my old house.

Sometime between her wedding night and ""The Impossible Astronaut.""

She was going into labor, and the Doctor destroyed her Ganger to wake her up.

Those who helped the Doctor at Demons' Run were people he had helped previously (off-camera in some cases), and owed him a favor.

**BULLSHIT** - being a city dweller, I have no idea what a mile actually looks like. All my distances are worked out in ""time taken to get there"" based upon time of day/traffic flow. Only pints of beer from a pub come in pints, as supermarket booze and even milk comes in litres these days. Fruit and veg comes in grams and kilo's too. The only truly imperial hangover we have is ""miles per hour"" and even that is just something you look at on your speedo to ensure you're not going to get points and a fine.

Everything in a modern childs life these days is in metric, from their weight taken at birth, to the physics and chemistry calculations they make at school.

EDIT - Now I know why he's living in the past - his wiki page [HERE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Percy)

&gt;He worked as a secondary school history teacher and taught in several schools.

Dear Mr Percy, the thing about history is... **it moves on**",0,1357718525,null,0,1357719733,0,c7tq15c,t3_168it9,t1_c7tq15c,t3_168it9,null,1430903592,27,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,27
true,KnownForNothing,lfc99,,"I don't watch hockey and have no experience on it, so I can't give my take on it.

This is starting to be a little bit long and drawn out, I'll try to keep my points simple and clear.

Firstly, are you trying to suggest that football should change the rules, or tweak it so that 'diving' or 'cheating' is less common in the game? If so, I have no problem with that.

But while the rules remain how it is right now, diving and cheating will happen. It just will. There's no way you can get the thousands of teams out there, including amateur teams, to 'play fair' or keep to the rules. Also, most of the time when you 'dive', it shows the referee contact has been made, and you should be given a penalty. As Gary Neville says it - 'Penalty?' 'Yes.' 'Dive?' 'Yes!'.

What players do is just show that they've been fouled and they should be given a foul. The official rules are actually very protective of players. If you are obstructed in the penalty area, contact was made that threw you off your tracks, like someone clipping you on the side(Shoulder charges are legal), your shirt was pulled, etc. All these things will result in a penalty, or free kick, depending on the cicumstances. I'm pretty damn sure any footballer can stay on their feet after having their shirt pulled, or have their heel clipped a little. But if you go down, and show the referee that contact has actually been made, you might just get the penalty.

&gt;Should the violators not be punished, though? Is it acceptable to do anything to gain an advantage, so long as you can get away with it? That is a terrible lesson for any sport to be teaching, and moreover, I find it hard to believe you would consider this acceptable if someone used this justification to cheat you out of money at cards (for example). Nor, I suspect, are many Liverpool fans talking about how ""rules are there to be exploited"" when we're on the losing side of an incident like this.

The answer is yes, in football, that is. In life in general, obviously they should be punished. I'm pissed that against Man Utd we got screwed, but what they did was basically what everyone does. Heck, Gerrard 'dived' for a penalty against Milan in Istanbul. Could he stay on his feet? Certainly! But was he fouled? Most definitely.

Sports don't exist to teach us lessons. They exist for entertainment.

&gt;Did watch it, find it to be a very uncompelling argument. ""Everyone is doing it"" is a terrible justification for doing anything, whether it's in a sport or just in life generally. And if diving is the only way to get the right call from the officials, that is a reffing issue that the league needs to address, not an excuse to break the rules whenever it seems potentially advantageous to do so. 

Let's assume everyone doesn't cheat. And Team A decides that they want to get an edge over their opponent. And so they 'cheat', or bend the rules, or whatever.

In the next game, they beat Team B. Team B is annoyed that they lost due to their 'diving' and 'cheating' and whatnot, so they decide to do it to Team C.

etc.etc.


At the end of the day, we can continue living in our dream world hoping and wishing for soccer to be a clean sport, but it won't be.

This'll be my last comment. You can reply if you want, I'll read it, but I'm a bit bored of this, it's dragged on like two days. 

My point in a nutshell is that, as long as 'diving' and 'cheating' gives and advantage to teams, they will do it. And there's nothing you can do about it.",0,1357718597,null,0,false,0,c7tq1jj,t3_162aup,t1_c7tq1jj,t1_c7t7uhz,null,1430903597,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,Saiing,cnty-england,UK -&gt; Japan,"A few points.  Be warned, I'm going to be harsh about this, because I think it's better to be realistic:

1. Having no degree is going to make life very difficult.  To get a job in I.T. in Tokyo you're almost certainly going to need to go through a recruiter.  Unless you have a stellar CV with experience in the type of sector they're recruiting for, which for foreign I.T. staff means mainly banks and financial services, it's going to be very very hard to find something once you're here.  

2. A large proportion of the non-English teacher, foreign I.T. or skilled staff in Japan are transfers from other countries who have been moved within their company to Tokyo for a few years.  You'll also be up against people with full residence visas who don't require sponsorship (your working holiday visa dictates that you're supposed to go home after 12 months).

3. Additionally, the Japanese economy is still in a rough state.  Although there have been optimistic signals from business leaders since the election, it's still far from certain whether we're going to see any real recovery in the short-term.  Jobs inside and outside IT right now are scarcer than a honest politician.

4. To be honest, JLPT4 or even 3 is neither here nor there with regard to work.  It's not enough to be able to work entirely in Japanese, or read or write to a proficient level without considerable help, so it's basically as good as no skill at all.  N1 is about the only thing worth having, because it suggests you could probably get by in an all Japanese environment.  And even then, you're unlikely to compare well to native staff so you're still stuck looking for foreign-specialist type roles.  It also sounds like you haven't actually taken the test.  Not having a certificate to back up your claim will count for even less.

5. The only other option I can think of is perhaps cutting your expectations of a full year a little and going for some seasonal work for 4 or 5 months in somewhere like Niseko, where there is explosive expansion of the ski industry and probably some job openings.  The money may be pretty lousy, and you might end up being a professional snow shoveller or cleaner if you can't find anything better.  They sometimes provide accommodation though.  On the downside you'd be stuck in a resort mainly populated by Australians and wouldn't really see a lot of ""real"" Japan.  You'd also have to wait until next year as we're already well into the season right now.

I don't want to put you off coming, because you should always try to achieve your goals, or at least give them your best shot, but I can't honestly see you being able to do much more than turning up, becoming somewhat disillusioned, and ending up (if you're lucky) getting a job with a dodgy private language school that doesn't require the usual international service visa (the visa for language teachers that normally requires a degree).  But I wish you the best of luck, and hope you prove me wrong.

You can use avios with any one world alliance airline but to be honest with the exception of BA the one world alliance is pretty shit. Star alliance offers a much better range of airlines.

Avios Tips:
Get a family membership: its free and you can add upto 6 family members and then pool all the avios they accrue. This helps you spend avios more efficiently.

Silver Membership: This is the point where avios starts to work, you earn more miles and get much more benefits here than in the lower tiers. Always having access to the business lounge regardless of the class you're flying in is a great perk for european flights.

Seat availability: Not all seats on a given flight are available to buy with avios, if you're looking to use avios to buy business class flights then you need to book a long way in advance to have a good choice of flights.

What do I use them for?

**Norwich**: They have only got 1 win in there last 6 games which was an unconvincing home win against Wigan, they seem like they are about to start sliding down the ladder.

**Southampton**: Definitely not beyond us to obtain a sneaky away win against the other Relegation contenders.

**Sunderland**: Managed a nill all draw at the Stadium of Light last time against Sunderland and in strange turn of events QPR actually had more possession and more shots, should go one better against them at Home and create some momentum with two wins in a row.

**Aston Villa**: Could go either way here but I am going to back the R's to win this one and to notch up there third win on the trot, Aston Villa have been very unconvincing all season and I am still sticking by the prediction I made at the beginning of the season that they will get relegated.

**Fulham**: I know it's an away game but for some reason we seem to really lift against West London rivals, it will be a tough game but we will have all the momentum and chants of Harry's greatness will be heard all across West London.

**Wigan**: Wigan have been very poor all season only getting one draw and one win in there last 8 league matches and are a serious relegation chance at this stage. This may seem ridiculous but I believe this could be QPR's fifth win in a row, a run of wins that has not been seen by the R's since the League One days of 2003.

**Reading**: After a couple of losses (or draws) we will get revenge for the defeat earlier in the season away from home. Reading are poor and will finish bottom.

The rest of the points would have to be made up with draws, maybe Newcastle, Stoke, West Ham and Aresnal. I am not saying this is going to happen, it is a long long shot I am merely calling my prediction and it is every chance that I will be way off but hey, a man can dream can't he?

true,MatthewMatic,cnty-expat,Expat East Anglian,"This sounds good to me (unless there was something awful I missed). I never understand these imperial vs. metric debates. Why not have both? Surely it's more useful to know two measurement systems than just one. Just like it's always good to know more than one language.

There are times when metric will be the best to use, and times when imperial will be. It will also prepare those going into science for the fact that they will encounter even more measurement systems.

Edit: For anyone arguing that imperial is an arbitrarily defined system, so too is metric. The metre is defined as a ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the North Pole. Hardly a useful definition unless you happen to be measuring the Earth. Differences between the different scales in metric are done by factors of 10. This is useful, because that's the base we use for our numbers. But this is just an arbitrary base that we use for historical reasons. A much more practical base is 12, since it is divisible by 2, 3, 4 and 6. Imperial uses 12 quite a lot, making it more logical than metric in this case. So let's say we use this to define a new measurement system for lengths. Let's make our basic unit the distance that light travels in a nanosecond. This is a distance that's quite relatable for humans, and uses the fundamental fact that space and time are equivalent from a relativistic standpoint. Then we make other units that are a twelfth of this, and twelve times this, etc. A light nanosecond is pretty much a foot, and a twelfth of this is of course an inch. So maybe imperial is the most scientific system after all (or at least would be with some reworking).

Also, the degree scale of Farenheit has its 0 at around the minimum temperature usually experienced in temperate climates, and its 100 at around the maximum temperature. So it nicely takes the range of temperatures in temperate zones and divides it into 100. Much more relevant to human experience than the phase transitions of water.

I'm not saying that imperial is better than metric. I'm just saying that each has their own merits and drawbacks. So maybe teaching both would be beneficial, especially as it has the side effect of helping teach maths with practical applications.",0,1357726791,null,0,1357763925,0,c7tr3cb,t3_168it9,t1_c7tr3cb,t3_168it9,null,1430904088,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

[You can film the police](http://www.met.police.uk/about/photography.htm)

Although if you're being arrested, I find it highly unlikely that the officer will let you keep your hands free. That's a matter of practicality, but you can probably leave the phone recording in your hand or pocket. That's too specific though for me to have an answer to.

A point less related to law, but I feel is important; it's rude to point a camera in someone's face. If you do plan to record it, at least be polite. Some of the yanks I've seen filming the police are massive cunts about it. I don't care about the situation, there is no need to be rude to someone who is trying to do their job.

&gt; Serious long-term health consequences and fatality from marijuana intoxication are essentially unheard of.  However, pets that are exposed to marijuana may display anxiety and disorientation, and are prone to ""bad trips"".  Intoxicated pets may lack the coordination necessary to consume food and water.

&gt; Intoxication with marijuana appears clinically similar to other, more serious forms of poisoning.  However, most animals recover from marijuana toxicity over a period of several hours.

Personally I think burning anything isn't great for you, although you can vape and eat it which then eliminates carcinogens.

It is one of the safest recreational drugs available and only a small minority of people have negative reactions too it.  Some people are more prone to mental health issues with continued use, but other than that the risks are tiny.

It also has some very real benefits for some people.  Cannabis and cannabinoids have been shown to give help for relief of pain, nausea and vomiting, anxiety, and loss of appetite.  It also feels really nice and is quite fun.

I'm not one of those people that denies there are risks involved, but I do say the risks are very low and most people can consume to their hearts content and have no serious negative effects.  I think the worst effect it has on a fair amount of people I know is they end up getting stoned . . . and that's about it, that's all a bit boring and sad.

We'll see if he gets found guilty, if do he will only face a minor, non custodial slap on the wrist, and it will probably lead off a set of appeals that end with the Supreme Court clarifying that public nudity is not automatically offensive.

"" 2002, British coroners cited cannabis as the major cause of death in 18 out of 853 drug-related deaths. The drug was also implicated in a further 31 out of 1,579 deaths involving a cocktail of drugs.""

Cigarettes are not listed anywhere as the ""direct cause of death"" I do not believe (could be wrong again). I would think that the cause of death would be cancer.

Also, it turns out that some people do have quite severe allergic reactions to cannabis, so it is entirely possible that someone was extremely sensitive to it, went into anaphylaxis and died and this was undiagnosed. 

I hope I am not being obtuse, but I would think that a baseball bat has a very high lethal dose if eaten. But it can be quite lethal indeed if smacked across the head with one. 

But I don't think I will be changing your mind.

Sahin is on Real Madrid first team wages. To squeeze him into the Dortmund wage structure would require a miracle.

If we end up doing that, then Rodgers is insane and I am going to be very mad.

What I am really hoping is happening here is that LFC are posturing as part of a permanent deal. The talk about Sahin not being suited to the Premier League is absolute bollocks, as anybody who knows anything about football, the bundesliga, the premier league and Sahin would be able to tell you.

The biggest killers were heroin, which was the major cause of death in 712 cases, and cocaine, which was the principal factor in 147 deaths.

But let's say that cannabis did actually kill those 18 people.  As in it some how poisoned them (maybe they smoked 1500lbs instantly). . . that's 18 deaths out of how many million users every day / week?

That's safe.  Very safe.

But cannabis didn't kill them, because it can't.  The biggest risk of death is from any mental illness issues that it exaggerates, but that's can be *nipped in the bud* by getting help and stopping consumption.

I can't find any cases (other than a single forum post) of someone being severely allergic to cannabis?

Not to enforce my own opinion on you, but I think in terms of experience I would go for the Platinum package at a non Cat AA game instead of getting a lesser package for a huge game.

true,ActionPriest,null,null,"&gt;It depends entirely upon how the employer views the caution and exactly for what reason it was given

And how is that remotely different from a regular conviction? You are in the position of having to justify your criminal record to a person to convince them to give you a job, when they have dozens to hundreds of other applicants with no criminal record. 

My point was not that you you will get if free by refusing, my point was that, as regards having a criminal record, you should treat it the same as any guilty plea. You are admitting the offence. It will give you a criminal record, which you will highly likely have to justify to a future employer, just like any other criminal record. From the perspective of a job applicant there is no meaningful difference between a caution, and a conditional discharge, even though one is a conviction, and one isn't.

They are a very big deal, especially in the current jobs climate, and should be treated with a great deal more respect and fear than police try to present them as deserving. They are not something to be done with brief consideration, without speaking to a solicitor, just to make it go away. 

Edit: Finally the conviction rate in England and Wales is not high. Major cases with significant police effort have only an 83% conviction rate. The assumption you would be convicted automatically over matter the police would prefer to issue a caution over, or even that the CPS would chose to pursue the matter is not a good one. By all means accepting the caution if they have you bang to rights is correct, but waiving all if your rights and admitting guilt at the first hurdle in exchange for a criminal record available to employers, and which will result in harsher treatment by the legal system , just to escape the risk of a discharge, probation or community service is far from the right thing to do for many people.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Being *able* to defend yourself with sheer power is only a small part of security. It's the last line of defense, and often by the time you're at that point, you've lost.

The most important thing is prevention. This can be seen in any area of security. Preventing access, attacks, danger, is important. Concealed weapons do not *prevent* anything. They barely protect you at the last moment, and lead to escalation, which is anti-security.

It is always pointed out at this point in the discussion that there is always somebody else out there illegally carrying the banned guns, and to that I always respond; that doesn't matter. Guns aren't swords. You can't pull it out at the last moment as a person approaches you to defend yourself; you will be shot. If you pull out a gun in a hostage/ mugging situation, you'll be shot. 

Your best bet is not to carry your *own* weapon, but to learn self defense. It is *very* easy to get a handgun off of somebody holding one. If you've ever fired one yourself, you'll know that untrained individuals do not have the skill to accurately fire a gun in a reasonable time frame. It would not be impractical to perform a disarming maneuver with your own body, even against someone of vastly superior physical strength, because the weak point of holding a handgun is the grip, which is easily overpowered with the correct technique.

In the case that you are too far to disarm, but too close to run, even if you had a gun, you'd only be useful in the very minority of cases where you're already prepared and very well trained. The average citizen would not be able to use the firearm in a manner that helps the situation. Even police in the USA have been shown to routinely damage bystanders when firing at an actual criminal.

In short, the best defense is the fact that most people who illegally carry guns cannot use them effectively, knowing how to defend yourself, using common sense, and not hiding your security. If handguns became legal, concealment should still be illegal, for the protection of the average person. A criminal will be more deterred by an individual holding a gun openly than one who he thinks is an easy target, and by the nature of concealment, it will be easier for him to target you while you try to unconceal the gun.

I still think that ease of concealment itself is enough to keep handguns illegal. It might be still possible to conceal a shotgun, but the difficulty and practicality of such a thing is much less to the point of impracticality.",0,1357736895,null,0,false,0,c7ts92y,t3_168gxe,t1_c7ts92y,t1_c7ts1w9,null,1430904634,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

Having benefits raise at greater than the rate of inflation when wages are not is not about propping up wages but about protecting those who are in work but vulnerable. The government is pushing this as ""unfair"" to those of us who have jobs and decent incomes and in the strictest of sense this is true, those people will benefit more than me,  but that is both short sited and selfish. I want my tax to help those who need it but I'm also fully aware that I could very easily lose my current job and either end up out of work or working for a crappy wage.

I also feel putting more money in the pockets of working people who will, have to even, spend it is one of the best ways to get cash flowing in a healthy manner. So this is something that can be viewed and that I see as not only as making economic sense but in my own selfish and socially moral interests.

Living close to London I don't have to stay in hotels, so I can't talk from personal experience, but you can can certainly afford to stay in central/upmarket areas - the West End/Bloomsbury/Knightsbridge.
Trip Advisor etc are your friend.

With London, you can hardly leave the hotel without tripping over a historical/interesting location, and many of them are free/do not require special planning - things like Tate Modern, Natural History Museum, Science Museum, St Pauls etc you can just turn up.

Within a 20 minute walk around Leicester Sq you can see Buckingham Palace, The Mall, Admiralty Arch, Horse Guards Parade, Houses of Parliament, London Bridge, London Eye, Trafalgar Sq, China Town and Soho, and then branch out to Oxford/Regent St.

Unique experiences perhaps? Afternoon Tea at The Ritz? Dinner at the top of The Shard?

If you can narrow your dates down, look at a hospitality package at Stamford Bridge.

Not only because violence is cyclical and will hurt NI and cause more hate but partly because it'll get to the stage were we'll need to balance our own books and not rely on the block grant and if we're spending £7m on policing for things like this and hurting our own prospects for investment our economy is fucked.

Ultimately NI needs to develop respect for the Democratic process even regarding these issues of flag flying and also respect the institutions created for parading on both sides.

it has been increasingly comfortable, over the Labour years. now it is becoming less comfortable, mainly because of a worldwide recession and a government that can't afford it. that's not a contradiction. 

&gt; And I think people willing to rip money off from the state are more likely to rip money off from the charities as well, except the people who genuinely deserve it are harmed, not those who are ripping off the system, caused by this uncertainty

this assumes charities are as bad as the government at dealing with those ripping them off. I see no reason to agree with such an assumption; a well run charity focused on helping the most vulnerable is likely to be much better at managing funds and getting it to the right people than government; which has shown us repeatedly how it can't manage this.

I'm an engineer and I've never met another engineer who uses imperial. Even the guys older than me use metric for everything. I remember my first job (1995) when I made the mistake of mentioning an imperial measurement when I was talking to an old Dutch mechanical engineer. He gave me the filthiest look and I never made that mistake again.

I was amazed (and appalled) when I started driving in the UK that they use miles for ~~geographical~~ transport distance measurement, but metric for everything else. At least you drive on the correct side of the road.

I also couldn't believe the UK uses the SI standard unit ""m"" to indicate miles as well!!  It took me a while to get over the fact that 25m wasn't 25 *metres*. It's pretty obvious that there isn't a village within walking distance of the road sign on the M1 but couldn't they have at least used ""mi"" to indicate miles? Very bizarre.

There's no longer any excuse to keep using imperial since 10th December 1799 (adoption of the metric system in France).

true,ThisIsMyRedditLogin,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt; Honestly, how much longer before we have arab spring type movements here?

I doubt anything on this scale would happen in the UK.  Besides, our protests and riots never sway Government opinion.  Remember the student protests/riots a few years back?  It didn't stop Cameron and Clegg upping Tuition Fees.  Blair didn't give a shit when there were mass protests about the Iraq War.  Nothing happened when there were protests about the banking scandals going on.  And then there were the more recent London riots.  They started off being a protest about a policeman shooting a kid but ended up being a mass orgy of theft and vandalism.  

Another reason that an Arab Spring will never take place in the UK is that firearms, of the kind needed to start a revolution, are illegal here.  The most we can do to show our discontent is read the Daily Mail, vote for UKIP or go on a pointless protest in the streets of London.

However, what you are suggesting seems in essence exactly what we have now, except that the people running it are more competent and isn't run by the government, and it is also relying on people's generosity, something that is not a consistent and ready thing, to those who many view as lazy. Charities will not receive the same amount of money as the government does, nor have the other resources available to them the government has. 

In short, it seems impractical. You remove support for those who need it from the government, and hand it entirely to a system that is not ready for it, to avoid giving those who are lazy support, a minority of those receiving aid I might add, all in the name of less government regulation, which is instead replaced by charitable regulation, unless support is handed out willy-nilly, which is likely to be filled with much the same person who handled the government regulation.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"I don't disagree about the divisiveness of the rhetoric, but there is still a fundamental underlying choice to be made where money is spent, which is what I mean when I talk about false premises. The public debate at the moment is broadly between the coalition who want to cut expenditure, and Labour who want to maintain or increase spending on public sector wages, and on welfare, in order to spur growth. But if you want to spur growth, why not spend the money on things which will provide future utility? 

The construction sector has collapsed post-2008; rather than increasing JSA for a builder who is now on the dole, spend the same money on actually undertaking that congested A-road upgrade which has been on the cards for decades. It increases short term demand in the economy, sends a major percentage of the money to the same people (the builder is paid to work, rather than look for work), and provides a long term increase in the productivity of the local economy, increasing long-term tax returns.

The biggest decreases in coalition spending have not occurred in departmental spending (which has so far risen after 2008, then plateaued from 2010 onwards), but in non-departmental capital investment, into infrastructure. No-one is making this case, because it falls into neither parties sectional interests.

&gt;Working people may also come under this but because we live in a upside down culture where we tax working people only to hand money back in benefits. working people shouldn't be on benefits!

By may you mean do and that is the reality. The government is not seeking to change the nature of the fact that working people are on and need benefits, just cut them.

true,NEWSBOT3,cnty-uk,Londontown,"yeah, however - i've never given 3 months notice to leave a job - i gave 6 weeks at my last place and they didnt dispute it - its pretty common for contracts. Plenty of people that i've worked with have given 1 month when the contract says 3.

I'm reasonably certain you could argue it as unfair in a lot of cases - companies arent willing to wait 3 months for new staff to join them etc.For some jobs (senior management, client relationship etc) it's clearly necessary, but for many it isnt. 

In theory it should work both ways, however practically a lot of companies will make a whole sub-company redundant so it ceases trading, thus avoiding the notice period entirely.

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"&gt; a charitable system will never be ready for it, as the only way to make it ready is through government intervention

or government non-intervention. People will not die overnight if the government reduced or removed benefits. Foodbanks, shelters and other charities are out there, and exist to find and help the most needy. 

&gt; You are also assuming that the rich would give more money to charity, but given that they are opposed to tax increases as it is, in fact wanting them lower, I highly doubt that, although again, a null point.

people are generally opposed to what is taken from them by force being spent against their wishes. Paying tax is compulsory, charitable giving is not. you are confusing the two, which is a big mistake. If the rich believe plenty of their tax goes to the poor, obviously they will not be giving much charitably. remove the government, and people are suddenly more willing to help, because they know it is going towards the *most* vulnerable; not anyone who can fill in a benefits form. 

&gt; The government funding given out is mainly necessary

says who? was it necessary to provide child tax credits to those earning over 50k? or winter fuel payments to pensioners living in Spain? government benefits has run wild, it is ridiculous to say it's 'mainly necessary'. no charity would be required to replace the removal of winter fuel payments or child tax credits for the rich. 

&gt;  those who are abusing the system and removing the support than just removing all funding and allowing greater instability and financial woes to those who are trying and genuinely need help

of course there are those abusing the system, but there are also those not abusing the system, just taking what the government has handed them, whether they needed it or not. Labour threw handouts to everyone, this government is trying to take them back. not everyone needs benefits; only those in greatest need. and incidentally, that is who charities focus on helping.

true,KarmaAndLies,null,null,"&gt; Really, if you cut back on child support, that'll lead to a lower birth rate in the lower income brackets.    

Will it? Do people really consider the financial rather than emotional side of things when they decide to have a child?     

I mean we have all read these stories of the teenage girl who had a child to escape an abusive household, and no doubt that happens. But I think the vast majority of births happen because, frankly, people want a child. They aren't for financial gain.    

&gt;  1) The adoption rate increases. This is especially beneficial if parents adopt teenage kids, as obviously there are less kids in care, and the parents can go back to work sooner as the kids may be less dependent (unless they have severe behavioural issues which is another matter entirely).     

Why would adoption rates increase? I don't understand how that relates to cutting benefits.   

&gt;  2) The vast majority of children come from upper income households. Those who would have been born into a life of poverty just don't exist, they're never conceived. That pre-emptively solves child poverty.    
&gt; Children are no different from houses and cars and should not be subsidised by the government.

People have the democratic right to change the situation back to the flag flying constantly and no policemen getting shot or Lidl lorry being highjacked has that right. If we do not accept Democratic process we accept the politics of fear and violence which has brought this country too low too recently.

You're exactly right, people do need to develop respect for the democratic processes. People do indeed have the democratic right to change the situation to whatever they want. In the case of this flag issue, the people of the city voted in a primarily Nationalist council (16 Sinn Fein + 8 SDLP, 15 DUP + 3 UUP + 2 PUP, 6 AP + 1 Independent), and this council voted to fly the Union Flag on designated days. What then is the correct way to change this? Well the answer is most certainly not rioting, nor is it protests that cause a significant inconvenience to the vast majority of people in the country trying to get home after a long day of work. The answer is simple, at the next council (and possibly general) election change the makup of the council.

International corporations were investing in increasing numbers in the local area, creating a not insignificant amount of high paid jobs.

true,sm9t8,eng-somerset,Somerset,"Within the peerage there's various titles (all are Lords):

* Duke
* Marquess
* Earl
* Viscount
* Baron

And there's also titles outside the peerage:

* Baronet
* Knights 
* Scottish feudal barons &amp; Lairds

The higher up that list the more senior you are in rank and the order of precedence, although there are exceptions to this. I believe the order of precedence comes from the idea of being presented to the monarch in a certain order in court, so the more important you were, the less time you had to wait around, but I'm not sure.

I'm not entirely sure about the distinction between non-peerage and peerage either, other than historically peers got to sit in the House of Lords and non-peers didn't. The House of Lords is the British equivalent of the Senate although it's not a perfect comparison in terms of power.

The titles of peerage are hereditary, as is the title of Baronet. Most holders will have inherited them from their father, some were made peers by the monarch in reward for their services to the nation. Their eldest son will inherit the title.

In the British system everyone without a royal title (i.e. King, Queen, Prince, Princess) is a commoner whether they're got a peerage or not. You can have multiple titles which creates a little more complexity with the eldest son being able to use a lesser title of his father's.

We no longer award hereditary titles to non-royals. There used to be certain additional rights and restrictions that came with peerages, for instance a peer can't stand for a seat in the House of Commons, but was entitled to trial by the House of Lords.

Nowadays having a peerage doesn't automatically entitle you to a seat or trial in the House of Lords, and I doubt there are any rights left outside parliament.

We've also created life peerages. Life Peers are considered of Baronial rank but the title doesn't get passed onto their children. This was created so that people could sit in the House of Lords without filling the house up with their descendants. Day to day, only people of Baronial rank are known as Lords.

Where these titles came from and what they meant in practice in the middle ages and earlier is a much longer story requiring the feudal system to be explained.",0,1357745815,null,0,false,0,c7tu5m4,t3_168x8d,t1_c7tu5m4,t3_168x8d,null,1430905533,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

You are again assuming that just because people are paying less taxes, they will give more money. You suggest an idea that by taking away government taxes from this, suddenly people will give more money to charity. This was not the case when there where welfare states, and whilst charity was hugely important, it could not cope with the number of people it needed to help, and many suffered as a result. 

Also, how do these charities decide who is the most vulnerable? In much the same way as the government does at the moment I would presume, although hopefully you can enlighten me.

Regarding the necessity of taxes, you picked three instances where is was not necessary, and included the minority of those receiving benefits. What about the millions of people not on £50,000 a year. If you earned  around £60,000 a year, you'd be in the top 5% of the country, £45,000 to be in the top 10%. Are you honestly saying, because less than 5% of those receiving child benefits didn't deserve them, they aren't necessary? I will not argue with you over money for those in Spain, as that is of course ridiculous. 

What you are therefore arguing is from a tiny portion of those receiving benefits that aren't actually necessary, and trying to say that the majority of them aren't.

And I agree much of the benefits need to be repealed, 100% with you.

That's frankly just one guy jizzing over the dong feng, I know all about it, I know all about the responses to that argument, and you can bet your arse that carriers aren't the ""folly"" that guys like the above make out. For instance if they were, why would China be racing to build as many of their own as possible?

Carriers are fast, they're very small given the size of the ocean, and they're not the simplest things to hit from 3000 miles away. You need amazing command and control, you need to *know* where the fleet is precisely, you can't even be a few metres off. There are plenty of people out there who are worried about Dongfeng and similar developments, but no-one seriously thinks that they're a complete game changer. Anti-ship missiles have been around for ages, the Russians had one with a 3000 km range back in 1984. There will always be defences against these things, and where defences are lacking, new ones are rapidly developed.

Frankly, with the standard aegis defence grid which exists around a carrier, I'd question whether the dongfeng stands much of a chance in anything but complete saturation attacks, but even then there are a great number of variables to account for in warfare which people like the above author completely fail to address.

true,i_sideswipe,,Belfast,"&gt; I seem to remember much indignation (especially from Alliance) when Lisburn CC decided to review their flags policy. 

I find it interesting that you raise the point about Lisburn Council's flag policy. Back in 2006 the then primarily Unionist controlled council, on the basis of an Equality Commission and a previous report, voted to restrict the flying of the Union Flag on council buildings to designated days, with the full support of both Unionist parties on the council at the time (DUP and UUP). However, when this happened 6 years ago, there was no mass protests province wide against this ""attack on Unionist culture"". So I ask you this, what has changed in the 6 years since to make this issue suddenly become so heated, when frankly not two shits were given in 2006?

With regards to the situation in Limavady. You're right, this should be brought forward for future discussion.

&gt; Note: Alliance stood only in 2 electoral wards at the last council elections in Limavady.
&gt; Revealing insight into Alliance priorities.

Is it really? According to the election statistics at [ARK](http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/lglimavady.htm) there are only three electoral wards involved in Limavady Borough Council. Putting aside the facts that this was both the first year that Alliance had stood any candidates in Limavady since their last appearance on the ballot sheet in 1989, and that they received the lowest number of votes of any of the candidates, the only insight I can gleam is that they stood for election in the majority of electoral wards available in this council and lost.

not following your 'government intervention' point. who has to spend a huge amount of money, and on what? charities are already multi-national organisations serving thousands. I think you underestimate the charitable sector or their effectiveness. 

Also I don't remember ever saying anything about reducing taxes; only about the spending of those taxes. (though it is certainly more likely that a person with more money in their pockets is going to increase their giving to charity, compared to someone with less money). 

&gt; This was not the case when there where welfare states, and whilst charity was hugely important, it could not cope with the number of people it needed to help, and many suffered as a result.

no system of government or tax programme has ever eradicated poverty, I am aware of that. I am sure you would agree that there are many still suffering now, *with* our current bloated benefits system. so this seems a moot point to me. 

as to charities deciding who is most vulnerable; they just give to who asks. If you have to go to a shelter or foodbank to get food, you must be pretty hard up. It is easier to sit at home and receive a cheque from the government than go to a foodbank.

Because in east Belfast and other loyalist estates it's not about flags.

There are 15. Alliance ran in 2 and got ~2% of the vote. You're confusing wards with districts. The point is Alliance preach a lot about being middle of the road but how can they claim this when they are almost entirely embedded in protestant areas?

Same for the Newry playpark issue. Anyone know how many Alliance candidates there were in South Armagh/Down at the last council elections? Zero. The self-professed middle ground aren't even giving nationalist-majority areas the ability to vote for this alleged middle ground.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"Scaling back the hysteria and hyperbole at least a little bit:

- Global Warming

They don't agree with carbon targets and rather than outright denying climate change their argument is for all the billions being spent on it it's not changing anything.  Not that there won't be a solution in the future, but it won't be what people are doing now.  Especially with both North and South America, Africa, the Middle East and Asia *all* not setting targets according to Kyoto.  

For the record I agree with them on this.  Scrap windmill subsidies - go full nuclear.  When you're overflowing with affordable electricity you can then actually begin a Manahattan style Air Fuel Synthesis Programme - and that will be a worldwide solution/revolution, which will ultimately be much better for the environment.  The windmill subsidies are a racket. 

- Against GM crops

Well I'm against GM crops for the simple reason that they stunt biodiversity amongst seeds.  Biodiversity is what stops species from being wiped out when a disease appears.  From their perspective they want to drop the Common Agricultural Policy and establish their own policy tailored for British farms.

-  They're anti-gay: against gay marriage

They're actually pro making no distinction as far as government is concerned between civil parnerships and marriage.  When they step back from saying pro-marriage, they're saying they don't want to get into the religious debate of the government telling religions what they have to do.  As far as anti-gay: [it has it's own LGBT campaign group with a campaign logo of 'Out and Proud'.](http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/09/25/ukip-approves-internal-lgbt-campaign-group/)

As for what one member said about gay adoption, every party has people like that - except maybe the Lib Dems but who knows.  It's hardly honest to try and make it indicative.

- They want to get rid of the human rights act/ECHR

They want to place the UK in charge of its own human rights, decisions, not to remove them.

- They want to turn away from multiculturalism as an approach to society.

They promote a single British identity regardless of religion, race, origins, ethnicity, and other culture.  And encompassing sense of an umbrella 'British' culture.

- Suicidally cut all trade links 

They advocate re-negotiating a trade agreement *before* leaving.  There is already one in the EEAA which the UK is a signatory of, which they've said would serve as an adequate fall back position for negotiations.

- or forced to follow EU trade decisions without having a say in them in the Norway model.

Just because Norway has a current model doesn't mean that's where the UK has to go, or that we're limited to what already exists.  That's why it's called *negotiation*.

- Increase defense spending by 40% - that's approximately £20b more and far more than membership of Europe costs us by any metric.

So?  I don't agree with it, but why shouldn't they argue spending more on something than they currently do on Europe?  They also advocate spending more on benefits and the NHS than what we currently spend on Europe.  Does that make that necessarily bad?

- a bunch of regressive tax policies such as abolishing inheritance tax, and imposing a flat rate of income tax on income above £11k (i.e. huge tax cuts for the very rich)

It's a huge tax cut for everybody actually since they also advocate removing National Insurance for both employers and employees.  I don't necessarily agree with this either but I'm glad someone is starting to think outside the box on tax reform because a whole raft of taxes aren't currently working properly.

- they want to cut bureaucracy without affecting front-line services which is the most tired truism in the history of politics

Doesn't actually mean it can't be done, and there's certainly a lot of bureaucracy that could be removed from teaching, policing and the NHS and actually improve front line services.

------------------

There's loads of honest critiques of UKIP to be had and made.  There's no need for the hyperbole and misrepresentation.  The more they do that on the MSM the more they're driving people to considering UKIP.  Likewise, if you turn it into a circlejerk here you'll be doing yourself a terrible disservice.   If you put your ire on a low flame, you can actually make a much stronger argument.

Right now there isn't anything stopping you from getting a girlfriend even without financial help, there is however something stopping people from working when they have kids (in fact the law is such that leaving kids alone at a young age is illegal).    

So right now the government won't help pay for you to get a girlfriend, but they will help pay for you to have sex with her (via the NHS).

So if we continue the same trend as you see in a normal Chelsea 3-4 years then we are getting slightly poorer and poorer however these losses are suffered by every club. 

If we are really going for the cutting off of players salaries etcetera then we are still getting poor but at a slower rate. This seems to be the most likely case and judging by the players we have already got, seems like we wont be signing more high profile players apart from 1 or 2 in the coming year so that is more amortization off the books and will improve the accounts even more.

So IMO we are going to face what every club will be facing but overall Chelsea is improving and in terms of getting rich as a brand wise, the name of Chelsea FC is on a very stable upward trend which means even though we will be suffering from loses, you can look at that as a form of investment into the name of the club increasing it's fans, player quality and activities.",0,1357748174,null,0,false,0,c7tutwo,t3_168xs8,t1_c7tutwo,t1_c7tupid,null,1430905852,6,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,6

Ok, so lets start this way.

1. Travel - Seeing as you're going to in london and are wanting to do a lot of travelling about (I'm guessing). You can either Travel around by [London's bike hire scheme] (http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/cycling/15025.aspx) Which will be about $4 dollars a day as the video suggests, but I'd avoid the roads at rush hour. You can also get a travel card, such as an oyster. What I normally do is if I know I am going to be working in the city and not at home, is buy a Oyster like this in the [US] (http://www.visitbritainshop.com/usa/travel-transport/london-transport/product/london-visitor-oyster-card.html) or just buy one at the desk at any tube station and pay for a weekly pass, which should come up at about $150 for the both of you for a week. (i mean two separate cards). this enables to use the DLR (Dockland light railway) which will give you access to a lot of east london, the Tube and the buses, which are all very easy and mostly safe ways to travel. 

Fulham Broadway is the station to Stamford Bridge, but you CAN walk from Earl's Court which I think is better that being packed like a sardine from Earl's Court (but then again it would add to the match day getting your nose stuck under a rather rotund Chelsea fans Arm pit. 

Now where I suggest you stay will make it easy for you to get to Earls Court. 

2. Accomodation - I recommend you stay in the Notting Hill, Bayswater, Lancaster Gate Areas, as the prices are good and you will get good hotels. There are a plethora of amazing restaurants to try out, and lot's of nice bars outside of Holland Park, Notting Hill Gate and pretty much most central stations. In Bayswater there is an amazing beerhall experience which I recommend. Stayin on the central line would also mean it would take you 20 mins to get to Earl's court/ 30 to Fulham Broadway. All you have to do is get off and change trains from Notting Hill station, and get a District line train (Westbound Platform) heading towards Wimbledon.

These are some hotels that I recommend which are in your price range, with good reviews from tripadvisor: 

[Knightsbridge Hotel] (http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g186338-d195395-Reviews-Knightsbridge_Hotel-London_England.html)
[Royal Garden Hotel] (http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g186338-d193123-Reviews-Royal_Garden_Hotel-London_England.html)
[the Mandarin Oriental] (http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g186338-d188963-Reviews-Mandarin_Oriental_Hyde_Park_London-London_England.html)
[The Shaftesbury](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1182303-Reviews-Shaftesbury_Metropolis_London_Hyde_Park-London_England.html)

These are only a few and there are tons along that way. Try looking at Hyde Park also. What you'll find is that a lot of things in London you can easily walk to. 

3. The most important - Chelsea FC. Hospitality would be a good way to go and you're probably more guaranteed to get a ticket that way, but I would suggest that if you want to feel the game day atmosphere a bit more. Try getting a seat in the Shed End, Matthew Harding Lower or West Stand Lower. (these are my personal opinions) I have a season in MHL and I love it. 

You will have to either become a member to but tickets or look for them on Viagogo.com Most tickets are sold on general release to members but are snapped up quickly. They are also released in batches (for example man city in February and most Feb games are on sale on the 28th Jan if you understand me) DO NOT GO WITH A TOUT. I don't trust them, and they are definitely not looking to help out tourists because it's in their good nature. They will try and shaft anyone, so if you hear ""anyone need tickets, tickets for the match"" ignore them. 

I'm sure if you let someone know on this reddit that has either a member ship or season tickets what time you are coming, they would be more than helpful in doing a money for ticket thing, as in they buy the tickets, you bank transfer and then the tickets are given to you on match day. This could be risky as it is also, sort of a form of touting. You'd have to find someone that you trust to not screw you over. 

4. Things to see. there are so many things to do in this City (a lot depending on the weather) here are some things that I would think would be worth your while. 

Open top Bus tour : you get taken round london on the top of a double decker bus and often an funny/witty person will give you insight into the history. you can find these all over central [London] (http://www.bigbustours.com/eng/london/custompage.aspx?id=london_sightseeing_tour&amp;gclid=COiZtJLV27QCFU-6zAodIz0A7w)

[Another would be the tower of London]  (http://www.hrp.org.uk/TowerOfLondon/?gclid=CLrT2KLV27QCFYMXzQodLQ4Afw

[Maddame Tusaaude's] (http://www.hrp.org.uk/TowerOfLondon/?gclid=CLrT2KLV27QCFYMXzQodLQ4Afw) : This is where you and your wife take tons of pictures with wax historical figures and post to facebook

Hyde Park: Just go for a few walks, it's amazing

Knightsbridge: Very pretty

Covent Garden: Highly recommended. 

Brick Lane: Anbother great place. 

then if you have a chance, look for the markets, just to see the hustle and bustle of London Day traders. Such like : Portobello Market etc. 

Right I have to go now, but if you have any questions... feel free to PM me and I will try and help out as much as I can

true,London_Dave,null,null,"It is cutting benefits, as it is lower than the rise in inflation, meaning in reality, your benefits are cut. 

And whilst charity is multi-national, the set up in this country to help those most desperate is not as strong as some of these. We do not have the infrastructure for charities to be able to access, examine, and determine who needs the most help, and this would cost a huge amount to set up. 

What I said regarding reducing taxes, was I assumed that by lowering the amount spent on benefits, this would go back to the tax payers, who then would spend it on charitable donations. If not, I have no idea why they would suddenly feel more inclined to give to charity, as they'd still be paying for benefits anyway.

And I made a typo about the welfare state. I meant to say that when there wasn't a welfare state, people suffered, despite the rich having huge sources of income. You can see this throughout history, but just look at the early 20th century. 

I agree that there are still those suffering, and am not claiming that our system eradicates poverty, far from it. 

But I hold real issue with you argument of give aid to those who ask for it. It is easier to get a cheque than to go to the foodbank, but it is also easier to go to the foodbank than to get a job. You are creating a system that is just ripe to be exploited. Do these charities help those with housing benefits, for example, as that is hugely important to the most vulnerable. Do people just ask for a house or the money to afford one and get it? Or does this just apply to food, as I would presume that is one of the smaller issues that needs to be tackled when it comes to benefits.

And the majority of society doesn't rely on the government for everything. Many people rely on the government to barely scrape a living, but you should not reduce and decrease benefits because of these people. Removing them from the system would do that on it's own, and replace only with what is necessary with what is too be spent.

true,mejogid,cnty-uk,London,"The reason why the ECHR is a good thing is because the government can't easily wriggle its way out of it.  We don't have any mechanism to enshrine a purely British law - only those backed up by external organisations under treaty obligations can take a higher seat.

For example, there's no way for a Parliament to require a 70% majority to amend a bill of rights, because a future parliament with a 51% majority has complete power to ignore anything done by its predecessors.  The principle that no parliament may bind its successors or be bound by its predecessors is fundamental to the British constitution, and there's no real way to change this (short of a revolution).

A British Bill of Rights is, in effect, just another law.  If it ever got in the way of a future liberty infringing law, the government could simply repeal it.

There's a lot of theoretical debate about ways to enshrine it in some way, but the end result of repealing the HRA and withdrawing from the ECHR would be a worse attitude towards human rights.

It's also worth noting that the ECHR is a lot less rigid than UKIP would have you believe.  The absolute highest sanction that the the European Court of Human Rights can impose on the UK for failing to follow its judgements (e.g. prisoners' voting rights) is to kick us out - which UKIP want to do anyway.  There's no formal enforcement mechanism beyond that, and the downside is mostly the loss of face that comes from renegading on your own commitments and being declared in contravention of human rights.",0,1357749440,null,0,false,0,c7tv7p2,t3_168vb8,t1_c7tv7p2,t1_c7tuwmm,null,1430906106,32,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,32

true,hotcod,null,null,"&gt;Why do benefits have to rise faster than average wages? Its already happened - it's an unchecked cost to have them rising faster than wages - and it diminishes the incentive to actually work or increases money taken in takens only to be repaid back, it needs to be brought under control.

Again you are ignoring the fact this mostly effects those in work. 

&gt;The base personal allowance is increasing 23% from 11/12 - 13/14 - which is a significant shift to taxing the lowest paid less

Ok I was actually wrong on this point, I apologies. Looking at the actual figures and using the follow I did some basic numbers 

http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/6539 

The change in allowance rate for some one working 40 hours a week at minim wage gains them around £220 and the average loss is £165 but that is being dragged down by families who are only on child support benefits. But if they only work 30 hours a week it's effectively a zero sum and any one earning less than £8,105 will lose out. 

So for the most needy are at best not seeing that much help during a time in which costs of living are likely to rise and at worst seeing cuts. This gets better for with the rise to £10,000 that is expected but again that only helps people who earn over £9,205. As I recall somewhere around 10% of the population earn less than £8,000 but I maybe wrong about that and that may include young people.

Still the working poor are likely to come out worse off all things considered.

Best practice in the bubble was that the government had a mandate to keep inflation below 2%. Which they did, even though interest rates were low. 

Now since the crash inflation has been above 2%. But the Monetary Policy Committee have said that long term pressures are deflationary. The governor has to write to the government each quarter the target has been missed.

no, it means your benefits have risen, just that the cost of goods has risen too. just like people on work are facing. are you *for* an increase in benefits higher than the average increase in wages? 

you say charity would create a system ripe to be exploited - how can you not recognise this is exactly what we have now? my main point is not about replacing government with charity, rather about creating a different culture than the reliance we have come to know. no one likes taking from a charity, people are more than happy to take from a government. government tells people they are *entitled* to something, charity says ""we recognise you're hard up, take this"". and yes, there are many charities that exist to help people get housing - housing associations.

true,Mondoshawan,null,null,"&gt; I disagree. Iraq was badly executed, but perfectly just in it's goal.

Absolutely disagree. Saddam was our dictator, we had no problems with his crimes when they were in our name. Most of his most disgusting acts took place with direct western assistance e.g. the attacks on Kurds. 

Meanwhile, we continue prop up worse than him elsewhere. We only took him out because he'd become unprofitable. The invasion of Kuwait turned public opinion and our continued support was unsustainable and embarrassing. 

Any argument we took him out on moral grounds is self-delusion. 

&gt; Same for Afghanistan.

Again, disagree. The mission was to find Bin Laden. Regime change was a distraction that did nothing but harm the war on terror. It was a call to arms for jihadists and Al Qaeda is vastly more powerful today as a direct result.

The US government had no issues with the Taliban in 1997 when it flew a bunch of them to be lavished with hospitality in Texas. It was only when those deals fell through that the US sought regime change. 

And given that we are now in dialog with the Taliban for peace talks the original mission seems to have been a failure. 

&gt; Libya was well executed and a brilliant example of modern interventionism.

Really? Prior to invervention Libya was a secular dictatorship. Those tortured in Gaddafi jails were mostly the same people that we torture in our own secret jails. In some cases they were literally the same people. We backed a violent Islamist uprising in Benghazi, one which any government would be legitimately allowed to defend itself from. The rebels initiated all of the violence, at no time did the Libyan army attack ""protesters"". 

Today Libya is a shithole full of daily ethnic violence. The country has been ethnically cleansed of blacks and is now implementing Sharia Law. Militant groups hold entire regions and stage mass executions. There are more political prisoners today than there have ever been and most of them are being systemically tortured. Aid groups are refusing to patch up the victims because they know they are just enabling further torture. The rebels in Benghazi are angry their separatist movement was spun into a civil war, they want no part of what we call ""Libya"" &amp; continue to fight for this goal today. 

But hey, we removed Russia and China from their oil market, by that measure it was a ""successful intervention"". 

&gt;  I suppose you probably don't even know about the Sierra Leone intervention, for which they love us to this day, and I suppose you must be forgetting Kosovo, where we intervened to stop genocide.

I'll give you them. 

&gt; Presumably you also don't approve of Gulf War 1, where we repelled an invasion of a neutral nation by a hostile enemy

Not quite what happened. Kuwait was actively trying to bankrupt Iraq by ignoring agreed oil prices and quotos. They were also slant-drilling into Iraqi fields. We have invaded countries for far less. 

&gt; when they begged for help from allies?

No, they engaged a PR firm who lied to us all. Prior to this the support for intervention was minimal. Saddam even discussed the invasion with the US ambassador beforehand and was effectively told ""we do not care, it's not our concern"".

&gt; I'd accuse you of being a coward but honestly I think it might just be a mix of ignorance and faulty morals.

I'm sorry, but I feel I should be the one accusing you of ignorance. You don't seem to know much about the background of most of the interventions you mention. 

&gt; I guess you must be completely OK with North Korea and their concentration camps

true,mejogid,cnty-uk,London,"I don't want to get bogged down in global warming/GM debates, but both of their approaches are way against the scientific consensus.

&gt;  As far as anti-gay: it has it's own LGBT campaign group with a campaign logo of 'Out and Proud'.

This article itself is a good example of how much of a sham that is.  So is the fact that they refuse to call gay marriage marriage.  Coburn has said they're against banning adoption groups from prohibiting gay adoption, which has the effect of making it harder than it already is for gays to adopt.

&gt;  They want to place the UK in charge of its own human rights, decisions, not to remove them.

The main reason to do this is to make it much easier to ignore or renegade from human rights.  I already made a lengthly post in this thread about this.  The ECHR has been enormously beneficial to the UK by independently holding our government to account.

&gt;  They promote a single British identity regardless of religion, race, origins, ethnicity, and other culture. And encompassing sense of an umbrella 'British' culture.

Yeah, that's pretty much being against multiculturalism, isn't it?  Asking people to give up their own identities and beliefs because ours are better?  Perhaps they should have to give up their own religions etc.  Modern Britain is a cosmopolitan society - we gain enormously from interacting with other cultures.  The idea of imposing some sort of British stamp on top of the incredibly complex society we have is just bizarre, and harkens back to the nationalist tendencies of the early twentieth century.

&gt;  Just because Norway has a current model doesn't mean that's where the UK has to go, or that we're limited to what already exists. That's why it's called negotiation.

Norway has that model because it's the only model on which the EU will establish free trade with an external state.  It's also the only way that makes sense - you can't have free trade with an external state if you don't follow similar rules.  It wouldn't be a negotiation, because we'd have far more to lose from being cut out than the EU would from losing our trade.

&gt;  So? I don't agree with it, but why shouldn't they argue spending more on something than they currently do on Europe? They also advocate spending more on benefits and the NHS than what we currently spend on Europe. Does that make that necessarily bad?

Yes, because the money has to come from somewhere and they also advocate cutting taxes.  It's also a stupid and nationalistic approach to military - our military does not give us significant benefit as a nation, and no matter how much we spend we will not have the clout of the US/China.

&gt;  It's a huge tax cut for everybody actually since they also advocate removing National Insurance for both employers and employees. I don't necessarily agree with this either but I'm glad someone is starting to think outside the box on tax reform because a whole raft of taxes aren't currently working properly.

I don't intend to go through their policies in enough detail (although they're also against corporation tax), but assuming what you say is true - they're massively increasing spending while cutting taxes for everyone, doesn't that strike you as being a little ambitious?

&gt;  Doesn't actually mean it can't be done, and there's certainly a lot of bureaucracy that could be removed from teaching, policing and the NHS and actually improve front line services.

There is a lot of bureaucracy, but it's very hard to remove it without damaging performance.  Cutting waste and bureaucracy has been a flagship policy of the coalition, and they certainly seem to be hurting front line services in the process.",0,1357750281,null,0,1357752661,0,c7tvh4z,t3_168vb8,t1_c7tvh4z,t1_c7tuomw,null,1430906233,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

true,loveandmoney,1986,,"Thanks for replying. I didn't say Lampard's new contract was a coincidence, of course it wasn't, I just that's the nature of the game these days, it would've been interesting to see what would've happened had the club really tested his loyalty by not offering the improved deal but I'm glad they didn't and he stayed. I was really disappointed when Terry did the same thing with City before the 09/10 season. He completely stopped doing interviews and refused to confirm he would stay at Chelsea even though it was unthinkable that he would jump ship just for an improvement on an already lucrative deal. Then after he signed the new deal he said 'People should know me better than to think I was leaving', I knew he wasn't leaving (bought my new Terry shirt during the negotiations and it's a great reminder of the double winning season) but it was painfully obvious he was holding Chelsea ransom. 

As for AVB, Terry was getting picked and Lampard wasn't so he was more willing to play along. 

I'm not surprised that you confirm my Benitez suspicions and it hardly endears me to the guy any further. I disagree about his managerial ability vs Di Matteo and I think it's too easy to say our results before then were Di Matteo's fault. We severely missed Terry (yes I know Rafa hasn't had him available either) and Luiz was making mistakes in his place. I'm not sure Rafa would've got us out of that CL group, it was very tough and our team is very different to the one which won the competition last year. We have had the winter slump as a problem for a while now and Ancelotti and AVB found the same problem. 

It's the decisions from Benitez such as the rotation for QPR that baffle me, it's irrelevant that he produced our best league win on the season at Goodison if he then completely undermines it with a home loss to the worst team in the league. I remember Liverpool fans complaining about a lot of bizarre decisions when things started going wrong with him there.

Here's another thing that has been on my mind for a long time. The media make constant references to Abramovich's desire for 'attractive football' or a 'Barcalona style' but complain about his lack of public statements. So as far as I know, these pundits are putting words in Roman's mouth and guessing at his wishes. Do you know if he has a specific directive for how he wants to see Chelsea play? For a man who doesn't (or perhaps 'didn't') know much about football, surely if he saw us winning most of our matches he can't really know what he wants beyond that? We scored loads of goals with Carlo so I just don't see how he can have the football knowledge to understand or want changes to that.

Who is this ""we""? I never supported him. Did you? No? Good! Then stop saying ""we"" - I don't give a fuck what past government's have done, I judge only the individual actions. The morality of an action is not dependent on past or future action. Learn that. Learn it good, because if you would I could probably just completely stop there with this post.

&gt;Again, disagree. The mission was to find Bin Laden. Regime change was a distraction that did nothing but harm the war on terror. It was a call to arms for jihadists and Al Qaeda is vastly more powerful today as a direct result.

&gt;The US government had no issues with the Taliban in 1997 when it flew a bunch of them to be lavished with hospitality in Texas. It was only when those deals fell through that the US sought regime change. 

&gt;And given that we are now in dialog with the Taliban for peace talks the original mission seems to have been a failure.

Lots of stuff about other people's motives and outcomes, neither of which affect morality of a decision. See my last.

&gt;Not quite what happened. Kuwait was actively trying to bankrupt Iraq by ignoring agreed oil prices and quotos. They were also slant-drilling into Iraqi fields. We have invaded countries for far less.

Oh then that makes invading them OK then?

&gt;US ambassador beforehand and was effectively told ""we do not care, it's not our concern""

Which even if it were true would be irrelevant to the morality of any defence of an invaded nation.

&gt;I'm sorry, but I feel I should be the one accusing you of ignorance. You don't seem to know much about the background of most of the interventions you mention.

Oh I know plenty, I know all about the dirty deeds that the UK and US government's have been engaging in for (respectively) centuries and about 80 or so years. That doesn't change the general morality of intervention in specific cases, or the fact that many of their actions, whether the people in charge were motivated by moral factors or not, were still moral acts which are utterly justifiable and to be commended.

&gt;Nice straw man. Where's the intervention there?

There isn't any, the world lacks the appetite, it would seem. As I said, were Britain as powerful as it once had been and I had the choice, we'd be invading tomorrow.

&gt;We can't because Seoul would be flattened. We only pick on the weak.

We intervene where we are able. You're one of those lot who claim to love peace but really just don't want to get their hands dirty. Fuck the civilians in another country, so long as we don't have to do anything. So wracked with guilt that you can't accept that sometimes it's OK to kill the bad guys who're bombing their own people.

true,i_sideswipe,,Belfast,"&gt; There are 15. Alliance ran in 2 and got ~2% of the vote. You're confusing wards with districts.

Sorry, my bad. 

&gt; The point is Alliance preach a lot about being middle of the road but how can they claim this when they are almost entirely embedded in protestant areas?

Would you agree with my statement that Alliance are a small party? Would it be much of a stretch to consider that they may not have the politicians to stand a candidate in every electoral ward? In terms of small political parties, would it be fair to say that you should stand first in those areas where you have the politicians, and secondly where you are most likely to have the support? If so, and their support base is in Protestant areas, then surely they are simply trying to achieve the maximum possible number of councillors, MLAs and MPs, with the limited resources they have available. 

&gt; Given the above, and their mandate comes from within protestant areas like east Belfast, and their campaigning has been solely against perceived sectarianism from within this side of our community, how can they still continue to label themselves unbiased?

The policies of the party would allow them to continue to label themselves as unbiased. I'll use the flag issue in Belfast as an example. The three main Unionist parties want the Union flag to be flow every day, the two main Nationalist parties did not want the Union flag to be flown on any day, Alliance proposed the obvious middle ground that the Union flag should be flown on certain days. If Alliance had given their support to either the Nationalist or Unionist proposals, then your statement about being unable to label themselves unbiased would be fair, however by proposing a third option that received Nationalist support the Alliance party itself remained unbiased in the issue. You could also argue that if the parties councillors abstained from either of the two original positions, then they would be unbiased as the council itself has a slight Nationalist majority. 

&gt; Because in east Belfast and other loyalist estates it's not about flags.

The portrayal in the mainstream media has been that the current protests, and when they occur riots, have been due to Belfast City Council voting to fly the Union Flag only on designated days. Indeed for any vox pops of the ""people on the street"" the overwhelming majority that I have seen over the past month have been along the lines of ""They took down our flag, we want it back up"", with the remainder being condemnation of the riots and to a lesser extent the protests due to the direct and indirect damage they are causing to the local area.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Brown

&gt; In Office 27 June 2007

And if you look at 

http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_269144.pdf page 3

They have a graph of public debt **not including interventions** which rises sharply from the start of 2008. 

Now in the UK the shit hit the fan a bit later than in the US. Northern Rock collapsed in February 2008 and was nationalized.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Rock#History

&gt; The bank was nationalised at 00:01 on 22 February 2008 as a result of two unsuccessful bids to take over the bank, neither being able to fully commit to repayment of taxpayers' money. In doing so the Government effectively took ownership away from its shareholders, as of August 2011 without reimbursement. The media also reported cases where some shareholders had their life savings in the shares, which were taken from them.[13][14] The shares had already lost over 90% of their value prior to nationalization, and were valued at nil in an independent valuation process.

The other bank bailouts and quantitative easing came later. 

It's also worth pointing out that the reason the Guardian et al supported Brown was because he was Old Labour as opposed to Blair's New Labour. It was implied he would do less PFI and more direct state funding. Now there are pros and cons to that but one of the cons was higher public sector net debt.

Can we really blame Brown or was he clobbered by the financial crisis? I think it's honestly hard to call. The public sector net debt excluding financial interventions did go up sharply but that might have been because bad things were already happening even before the bailouts and QE and those reduced tax revenues. Or it could have been that spending increased as he had promised his left wing backers. Or it could be a mix of the two.

Look at this

http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/spending_chart_1990_2010UKp_12c1li011mcn_F0t_UK_Public_Spending_As_Percent_Of_GDP

It looks to me like public spending started to increase from 2006. Post 2008 the rate of increase grew. But that does say to me that even before the handover public spending was increasing. 

I think this is because a transition from New Labour (who I would still vote for if I could) to Old Labour (who I won't vote for) was in progress.

Or look at this

http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/spending_chart_1990_2010UKp_12c1li011mcn_40t

Welfare spending was under 6% of GDP during Blair's Premiership. It went to 8% when Brown was PM. Now you can say that people lose their jobs in a recession and that increases welfare. But look at health

Well, I think there's plenty the league could do about it, but they're only going to bother if there's pressure from fans. That's why I disagree with the ""well, everybody does it so whatever..."" attitude. If fans really decided they wanted to see the sport without cheating and diving, I think it could definitely happen. But there's no reason for players or the league to change anything right now, as it seems many fans don't really care about cheating or diving.

Don't want to get bogged down on the science?  Here's what they actually say about science funding and climate change:  

            ""To restore a fair balance in science funding, 
             all funding connected with ""global warming"" 
             research will cease until a Royal Commission 
             has heard the evidence on both sides of the 
             case, with all the rigour of a court of law, 
             and has substantively reported."" 

So they've actually thrown it back to the scientists but don't place much emphasis at the moment in the current subsidies delivering any results.

On the gay thing a party saying government should not differentiate in law between civil partnership and marriage, nor should it be in the business of telling religion what they have to do.

&gt;**Yeah, that's pretty much being against multiculturalism, isn't it? Asking people to give up their own identities and beliefs** 

Can you not see how dishonest you're being?

Nobody is being asked to give up identities or beliefs.  They're actually being asked to simply adopt one more.   Race, religion, origin -they say they're not bothered about and couldn't care less.  Be what you want - but that you can be all those things AND British.

&gt;**Norway has that model because it's the only model on which the EU will establish free trade with an external state.**

Not true.

Evidently not true.  

You've also just claimed what the EU will and will not do, as if you're in charge of negotiations.  You're not.  

You're being dishonest, again.

Alternative examples to the Norway deal are Iceland with different opt outs, as has Luxembourg, whilst still being all part of the EEA.  Switzerland isn't part of the EEA but has its own trade agreements and is part of EFTA. 

You really shouldn't be making these mistakes if you know what you're talking about.

&gt;**Yes, because the money has to come from somewhere and they also advocate cutting taxes.**

So why not address where they say the money will come from?  Because they're pretty keen on doing some things which they're not allowed to do in Europe.  They're also pretty keen to strip bureaucracy and regulation to the bone - and whilst there can be problems with that (which is exactly where your argument should be, but I'm not going to do it for you), what it does do is unquestionably is to allow business to run free.

&gt;It's also a stupid and nationalistic approach to military...

Notice how you've resorted to making judgments without actually substantiating anything.

You're basically resorting to calling UKIP names as an argument against them.  You say stupid and nationalistic, they'd probably say that it would be a very easy way to create A LOT of jobs, to provide a part solution for the perceived hoodie/chav culture, and to expand an industry.

&gt;**I don't intend to go through their policies in enough detail, but assuming what you say is true - they're massively increasing spending while cutting taxes for everyone, doesn't that strike you as being a little ambitious?**

How can you ask that when you're saying you won't even properly look into their policies?

Not that there's anything wrong with ambitious, but increasing spending on the military isn't the same thing as then going on to *assume* (which is all you're doing) that they promote increasing spending, when in fact they actually advocate cutting down the debt.

&gt;**There is a lot of bureaucracy, but it's very hard to remove it without damaging performance.**

No it's not.  Not necessarily so.  

That's something else you've just claimed, as if it were gospel, and it's complete assumption on your part.

&gt;**Cutting waste and bureaucracy has been a flagship policy of the coalition, and they certainly seem to be hurting front line services in the process.**

Or maybe it's that they've also been freezing budgets or only keeping them in line with interest and not inflation.  Maybe that has something to do with it and not ANOTHER assumption that it's the cutting of bureaucracy because that's convenient for your argument.

--------------

You originally answered a question about what it was with UKIP.  You answered a question which you don't actually know or understand yourself.  You've got an opinion, and that's healthy, but you're not too concerned with how well informed it is as long as it gets voiced.  And that's exactly what's wrong with the ongoing dialogue.

**tl;dr?**

                    ""I don't intend to go through their policies 
                     in enough detail, but assuming what you say 
                     is true...""

Sorry.  No.  No short cuts.  You can't have a discussion with me about what UKIP's policies and stances are if you have to say things like that.  If you don't know, you should be reading and not typing.

Semantics. Why are you focusing on such irrelevances? 

&gt;  I don't give a fuck what past government's have done, I judge only the individual actions. 

Really? So a persons character has no bearing on their ethics? We have proven ourselves to be consistently unethical. It is essential to be sceptical of our current actions in light of this. 

&gt; Lots of stuff about other people's motives and outcomes, neither of which affect morality of a decision. 

It clearly proves their motives were not based on morality. Motive is key, morality is propaganda for the masses. 

&gt; Oh then that makes invading them OK then?

By the standards of our own actions, apparently it does. What do you think would happen if Argentina illegally tapped in the Falklands oil and refused to stop despite international political pressure &amp; attempts to mediate? You can bet your arse we'd take action. 

&gt; whether the people in charge were motivated by moral factors or not,

I've already stated I disagree with this. Talk of morality is for our benefit, it plays no part in the decision to ""intervene"". Besides, in most cases we were already involved with some rebel groups prior to the action that supposedly spurned us into action. Case in point is Syria, the US and Turkey have been working with these groups for just shy of ten years. During the same period they gave Egypt's Mubarak the arms to keep a similar rebellion in check. We were still delivering him APCs and tanks while video of them mowing down protesters was on youtube. 

Do you honestly believe ""morality"" is coming into play here? 

&gt; were still moral acts which are utterly justifiable and to be commended.

Even the failures like Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya? We changed the government but the original issues regarding oppression and violence are now markedly worse. The moral argument falls flat on it's face when you look at the end result. 

&gt; &gt;  Nice straw man. Where's the intervention there?

&gt; There isn't any, the world lacks the appetite, it would seem.

It lacks the means, N. Korea is dug in with thousands of hidden artillery pieces pointing at a population centre to the south. The loss of life &amp; infrastructure would be considerable.

But that's not even neccessary, take Iran for example. We stand a much greater chance of success there but even they are deemed ""too powerful"" for us to intervene.

You hint towards calling me a coward; I say given our choice of easy targets that we are the cowards. 

&gt;  You're one of those lot who claim to love peace but really just don't want to get their hands dirty.

Nope. I have no issue with Kosovo, the Falklands, WW2 and dozens of other conflicts.

true,dontthrowstones,null,null,"&gt;Would you agree with my statement that Alliance are a small party? Would it be much of a stretch to consider that they may not have the politicians to stand a candidate in every electoral ward? In terms of small political parties, would it be fair to say that you should stand first in those areas where you have the politicians, and secondly where you are most likely to have the support? If so, and their support base is in Protestant areas, then surely they are simply trying to achieve the maximum possible number of councillors, MLAs and MPs, with the limited resources they have available.

You don't get MPs before you get councillors. Grassroots first - hence why Naomi Long is their only MP. They got elected where (surprise surprise) they built up a base by standing for council elections.

And they stand where they think they can get support. Evidently they believe they will gain little or no support from majority catholic areas. Why is that? Another, pseudo-protestant, internet personality claimed on another thread he felt catholics were more forward looking than their protestant  neighbours. How can this be so if their heartlands can't even scrape together an Alliance candidate never mind elect one? 

What are Alliance doing about it? Taking down the Union flag in Belfast? Would they not be better served defeating sectarianism in nationalist areas by targeting sectarianism in, you've guessed, nationalist areas? Why do they lack the courage of their convictions there? It leaves them open to valid accusations of bias.

How can Alliance go on berating unionist parties for perceived sectarianism when there is a gaping sectarian divide in their own electoral demographics across NI as a whole?

Do Alliance believe they'll have *any* credibility amongst the loyalist community after this debacle? Do they care, happier to play on their primary vote base, the politically-content culturally-neutral  protestant? That electoral battle they have shaped together with the DUP is not an agenda that works on an NI-wide level. It's as narrow minded as the supposed sectarianism they've attempted to stamp out with an almighty pair of hamfists.

&gt;If Alliance had given their support to either the Nationalist or Unionist proposals, then your statement about being unable to label themselves unbiased would be fair, however by proposing a third option that received Nationalist support the Alliance party itself remained unbiased in the issue.

Keyphrase: Unbiased in the issue. However, by ignoring the instances of sectarianism elsewhere in NI, where Alliance have chronic under-representation, they highlight further that their policies are concerned exclusively with perceived unfairness in protestant areas only. And that is where you have a clear bias in their representation. Alliance are at best a self-serving political organisation only interested in superficial compromise in their primary demographic - that of the guilt-fed protestant. Elsewhere they simply do not have *any* policy or representation, nor the will to change either of those shortcomings. In NI terms overall then, they are not middle of the road and should be challenged until such times as they can demonstrate progress across both these key metrics. 

I have yet to see them being challenged.

&gt;The portrayal in the mainstream media has been that the current protests, and when they occur riots, have been due to Belfast City Council voting to fly the Union Flag only on designated days.

Main-stream media analysis is rubbish. The Alliance raised this as an issue to setup an election battle with the DUP, the DUP whipped up the perma-protestors for the same reason and the riots are ongoing in east Belfast because the UVF don't want to stand trial/get arrested. That's it.

That right can be delayed for up to 36 hours by the police, if they consider it necessary (must be an officer of at least the rank of superintendent making that decision, can only be for one of a set number of reasons).

No adverse inference may be drawn from a defendant asking for a solicitor, and an interview should not be conducted until one is present, if requested. Any failure to adhere to this is a breach of PACE Code C, and may render evidence obtained inadmissible. Refusing to answer questions until your solicitor is present is reasonable and adverse inferences will not be permitted.

However, if your solicitor turns up and advises you to keep schtum (which is always the sensible option unless you have a solid alibi/explanation), anything not said in interview that is then relied upon in your defence at court permits the jury to draw adverse inferences, if it wasn't *reasonable* for you to maintain your silence in interview.

The argument, then, becomes ""it was reasonable because I was acting on legal advice"". This can be dangerous, because in raising that line, you risk dropping the veil of lawyer/client confidentiality.

That simply isn't true. Every night where there is a mass of protests, a significant proportion of people are affected and are unable to get home as key roads are blocked for a period of time by both peaceful and non-peaceful protests. Over the Christmas trading period, in Belfast City Centre alone, there was a significant drop in trade as the majority of people who would normally be out Christmas shopping chose not to do so, out of fear of being unable to return home at a reasonable hour or of being stuck in a protest of some kind. This lack of trade over that period will have a knock on effect on both the companies trading in the City Centre, and their employees. It is quite possible that hours will be cut for some staff, while others may loose their jobs entirely, not to mention that some smaller retailers may cease trading entirely. Of course there's also the £7+ million bill in policing both the peaceful and non-peaceful protests, that will either have to be picked up by the tax payer, or cut from other services. There will also be a not insignificant cost if any of currently arrested protesters are convicted and sentenced to actual jail time.

Anyway, when people talk about leaving the EU, I think it's usually *implied* that they mean leaving the EEA too because they talk about negotiating free trade agreements with the EU, which isn't necessary if they meant to stay in the EEA.

UKIP's position on the EU isn't really an economic one (though naturally they argue it to be a stronger economic choice) it's a sovereignty position, ergo any move that restores sovereignty to the British parliament is a better position than we are currently in.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"&gt;Spend no taxpayers’ money on the non-problem of man made climate change until a Royal Commission has heard both sides of the scientific case and has reported.

It is a non-problem if there's no solution to it, it's only a problem that can be fixed if there's grounds to suggest it could be fixed, and you could cover the UK with windfarms and the coasts with tidal generators and the UK could make zero difference.

I don't think it does make sense to use more resources to manufacture windmills which will spend most of their shelf lives trying to reproduce the energy gone into making it.

Having said that they have said that it would go before a Royal Commission and get a scientific ruling made in Britain, and I wouldn't expect the windfarm subsidies to come out of it alive because they're simply not the solution, other than people feel better when they think they're doing something.

&gt;And what does that mean?

You can be white British, or Indian British, or African and atheist and British, or a British muslim, or a British Sikh, or South American adopted Russian orthodox Christian British, or....

All cultures but with a common British culture.

If you've been on their manifesto you should have seen that.

           'UKIP believes in civic nationalism, which is
            open and inclusive to anyone who wishes to
            identify with Britain, regardless of ethnic or religious
            background. We reject the “blood and
            soil” ethnic nationalism of extremist parties.
            UKIP opposes multiculturalism and political
            correctness, and promotes uniculturalism -
            aiming to create a single British culture embracing
            all races and religions.'

That's their stance.  Some people might not like it, but it's still very dishonest when people claim their policies are racist, or when they try to equate their policy against multiculturalism as meaning they're against certain cultures.  In reality they're pretty much saying they're blind to individual race, origin and colour, and whoever you are you are free to identify yourself as British.

The banks did not fail.

The guarantees were not needed.

The banks actually PAID MONEY to join the APS and this turned into a net gain for HM Treasury.

And no, I don't include passive aggressive Twitterings as significant. Taking a different route home/longer to get home is not being significantly affected. Burying your father is.

&gt;Over the Christmas trading period, in Belfast City Centre alone, there was a significant drop in trade as the majority of people who would normally be out Christmas shopping chose not to do so, out of fear of being unable to return home at a reasonable hour or of being stuck in a protest of some kind.

True, but then as I've pointed out before we've been dealing with the threat of violence for a long time now. The effects of that are, relative to the isolated protests, incomparable on our economy. I've yet to see the commentors who take such delight in posting up every little inane detail on this specific period of disruption do so on our regular periods of protest e.g. residents groups, etc. 

Why is that?

&gt;there's also the £7+ million bill in policing both the peaceful and non-peaceful protests, that will either have to be picked up by the tax payer, or cut from other services.

A lot more than that is currently being spent, and always has been spent, on anti-terror operations post-'peace'. Where is the outcry over this? Have we just come to treat the threat of IRA violence is an acceptable norm? 

I have no doubt that the idea that this perceived easy run the remnants of the IRA get these days is what allows a lot of the rioters to get away with what they do from within their own community. Look at the reaction in Stormont when a DUP guy makes a comment about an SF murderer coming in to his constituency - where was the cross-community Alliance then? Leaping predictably to the defence of the former terrorist. The poor family of Mary Travers didn't get a look in, alliance probably with one eye on their electioneering vs DUP. 

People looking for a genuine solution to both the disruptions and the fecklessness within certain loyalist communities would be better served attempting to respond to the disconnect the 'centre ground' has developed with that community instead of joining in with the cybernat rent-a-gag choirboys intent on clicking their way into some kind of virtual separation from the rest of the UK.",0,1357757250,null,0,false,0,c7txpwr,t3_167foe,t1_c7txpwr,t1_c7twzl0,null,1430907291,-7,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,-7

The ideal libertarian position on marriage is that the government should have no part in it, marriage would be a private contract between individuals and would not require a state licence. Without state restrictions on marriage licences same sex couples can get married as could anyone else who is at the legal age of consent to sign a contract, this also means polygamous marriage would be legal as well, something even a lot of liberals find distasteful yet would deny to consenting adults.

However i'm also not ignorant to the current situation of the world and can see the state expand and be with us for a long time yet and would prefer to see marriage equality across the spectrum for those it is denied to currently.

I've heard much the same from seemingly educated ""nice"" people.

Other ""fun"" catchprases that condense the workshy scrounger hate, that are popular are:

""why dont they just get a job? its not hard.""
""Theres loads of jobs out there, they just want well paying, ""nice"" ones"" (the gall for wanting a well paid job)
""Obviously living the high life on the dole when I have to be in work at 7 in the morning""

It boils down to ""i have a job, why dont you?""  The fact that it seems even having a job isn't even enough these days, people with jobs resorting to food banks etc, should show the main problem inst people on benefits.

edit:
Also as pointed out else where we are seeing a change in the allowance on base rates that will actually end up making people who are earning enough to be taxed now about £50 a year but which still screws any one earning less that £8500 or what ever the current allowance is. So while these cuts are not as bad as I was thinking when put next to increase allowance this isn't a measure that is saving as much money as it might seem and it's effecting worst the people who need the most help.

Message from another redditor earlier today says it better than me:

*I think that your posts are sensible and your points well argued, and in any other subreddit they would, at the very least, see the light of day rather than being downvoted to oblivion. But, unfortunately, you are immediately labelled as a bigot by the bigots of the other side. They try and adopt a moral high ground, but their posts are peppered with 'cunt' this, and 'fuck' that. More than that, they are tinged with an inherent bias, bias being the very thing which they try and attribute to you. The internet warrior meets the Northern Irish nationalist.*

&gt;Cautious, selective, aggresive

That's the quickest contradiction you've managed today, well done.

lol :D

&gt;just how little the most outspoken members of the protesting population seem to know about their own history, culture and religion.

I seen this a few times now, where the cybernats, content in their mistaken belief they now speak for the middle ground, now claim to have a superior knowledge of loyalism too. That's interesting. I guess it's kind of like an Irish republican helping to run the British administration in Ireland.

&gt;  So they've actually thrown it back to the scientists but don't place much emphasis at the moment in the current subsidies delivering any results.

No, they're looking for an excuse to hold onto an anti-global warming perspective.  [97% of climate scientists agree that humans are causing global warming](http://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-scientific-consensus.htm).  There is no debate - every major study from the last 10 years suggests that anthropogenic global warming is occurring.  Talking about sending the issue to a Royal Commission is baloney.

&gt;  On the gay thing a party saying government should not differentiate in law between civil partnership and marriage, nor should it be in the business of telling religion what they have to do.

Except marriage can be a civil or religious union - in fact, [approximately 70% of marriages in the UK](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/vsob1/marriages-in-england-and-wales--provisional-/2010/marriages-in-england-and-wales--2010.html) are civil rather than religous.  Keeping gays out of the civil marriage system is just a cynical way to exclude them despite equality obligations.

&gt;   Race, religion, origin -they say they're not bothered about and couldn't care less. Be what you want - but that you can be all those things AND British.

Right - how does a government do this exactly?  Do we have a Britishness exam?  Does everybody have to wave British flags once a week?  Do we have Britishness classes in school that preach the virtues of empire?  They want to [""end the active promotion of the doctrine of multiculturalism by local and national government""](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20474120).

&gt;  Alternative examples to the Norway deal are Iceland with different opt outs, as has Luxembourg, whilst still being all part of the EEA. Switzerland isn't part of the EEA but has its own trade agreements and is part of EFTA. 

AFAIK the Swiss model is historic, and would likely not be made outside of the EEA today.  Any state that is part of the EEA has to abide by many of the stipulations of the EU.  EEA states can opt out of agriculture and fishery laws, which are frankly not that significant to the UK anyway.

&gt;   They're also pretty keen to strip bureaucracy and regulation to the bone - and whilst there can be problems with that (which is exactly where your argument should be, but I'm not going to do it for you), what it does do is unquestionably is to allow business to run free.

""Stripping bureaucracy and regulation to the bone"" is nothing but hollow platitudes.  Governments do not intentionally waste money, and the tories have taken quite aggressive moves to do so, but it's hard.  I severely doubt that UKIP as an organisation has the management and organisation credentials beyond the other parties to do this.  I did actually argue that it's not practical above - noting that the coalition has failed to do it without collateral damage.

&gt;  Because they're pretty keen on doing some things which they're not allowed to do in Europe.

Like what?  Leaving Europe allows us to screw around with tariffs and so forth, but they don't create money for free - and they'd be very hard to do while maintaining free trade with Europe.

&gt;  You say stupid and nationalistic, 

Because it is

&gt;  they'd probably say that it would be a very easy way to create A LOT of jobs... and to expand an industry.

[It's called military Keynesianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Keynesianism#Economic_effects), and it's about 50 years out of date.  It's creating jobs *with public money* - those jobs are just as much as a drain on the economy as the bureaucracy they want to strip to the bone.

&gt;  to provide a part solution for the perceived hoodie/chav culture

I'd far rather we tried to incorporate them into mainstream society through jobs inclusion programs than pack them off to join the army.

&gt;  How can you ask that when you're saying you won't even properly look into their policies?

No, I said I don't want to go into the precise figures of their budget.  I'm not an accountant and this is not my area of expertise.

Regardless, it is simply inarguable that you cannot remove inheritance tax, incorporation tax, and reduce personal income tax (apart from increases for the £10-30k group), massively increase military spending by 1% of GDP and increase benefits by ""cutting down on waste"".

&gt;  No it's not. Not necessarily so. 
That's something else you've just claimed, as if it were gospel, and it's complete assumption on your part.

If it were easy to cut down on bureaucracy, it wouldn't be the overwhelming rule in the developed world that there is, and for a long time has been, a large bureaucracy.  

&gt;  Or maybe it's that they've also been freezing budgets or only keeping them in line with interest and not inflation. Maybe that has something to do with it and not ANOTHER assumption that it's the cutting of bureaucracy because that's convenient for your argument.

I don't really understand what you mean by this.  They've tried to freeze budgets (there have been cuts despite what you say) and there have been a tonne of complaints that services are getting damaged.  You can't just cut a department by 10% to get rid of bureaucracy without seriously hampering performance.

&gt; Sorry. No. No short cuts. You can't have a discussion with me about what UKIP's policies and stances are if you have to say things like that. If you don't know, you should be reading and not typing.

NR tickets are released ~12 weeks in advance of travel and that is when you will get the best fares.

(Or in about 3.33 nanoseconds, if you prefer.)

Conversely in one nanosecond, light travels 0.3m. In one second it travels 299,792,458m (roughly, 300,000km). In one hour, 1080 million km.

So if you see a speed limit of 110km/h, what you're really being told is, ""don't go faster than (roughly) 0.0000001c""

We should probably just skip km/h altogether, and introduce new signage as follows:

30mph -&gt; 0.00000005c

70mph -&gt; 0.0000001c

This system has the advantage that, as technology improves, we won't need to replace all the signs again when intergalactic highways get built (the max speed limit then will be just ""c"".)

Obviously this person is slightly mental, and has strict religious views. It's fair to respect these if you're going to live with the person.

My take on these:

1. Clearly a religious thing. Pigs are sacred in some religions.
2/3. If I was letting a room in my house out to somebody, I wouldn't want it to be a hotel for their guests.
4. Fair enough. When I shared student houses, people using my stuff really pissed me off. For example, I'd get up and I'd have no milk for breakfast. I am not a nice person if I can't start the day with a coffee.
5. Standard
6. Probably a religious thing again.
7. I would assume there's a hot water tank, and 0600-1000 1900-2300 are the times the boiler is set to heat water for it. 
8. They don't want you hogging the kitchen, or stinking the place out. Obviously there are a number of people sharing this house, so any considerate person would do these things anyway. Although replacing the wallpaper... wtf?
9. Lodgers only let a specific part of a property. The landlord is within their rights to deny access to parts of it.
10. Bills are inclusive with your rent. Don't go mad and abuse it. Seems reasonable.
11. Who wants a smelly washing machine?
12. This seems extreme, but you should still clean up your mess
13. Fair
14. Fair
15. Fair. I think there are now laws against smoking in HMOs.
16. Same as 12
17. This is extreme. I'd be pissed if they just threw away my stuff without asking me first. Might be criminal damage or theft. I don't know.
18. Fine
19. What? Isn't this what the cleaner is for?

I can't be bothered to go on.

Basically, this is a shared house, where you're a lodger rather than a tenant. A lodger can be easily evicted, and doesn't need a deposit to be held in the DPS. All the landlord is doing, in a rather bitchy and mental way, is asking you to respect the property, and the people you share with.",0,1357761174,null,0,false,0,c7tz27a,t3_169dxv,t1_c7tz27a,t3_169dxv,null,1430907919,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Religious stake in marriage is a substantial minority one. Moreover It has a far, far longer history in England and Wales of being a civil and social compact, than a religious one. Priests performing marriages is a relatively recent innovation. If you care to consult the work of scholars on medieval marriage, such as David Davray of UCL, you will see for the vast majority of people there was no involvement of churchmen whatsoever.

If we had a complete separation of church and state, then churches could bless relationships as they choose, and the state would authorise marriages as a civil, legal and social compact. If one position performs 70% of marriages all by itself, and the other only 30%, whilst having no meaningful historical connection too it ownership if the process, it's pretty clear who should have control.

The Daleks have a total invasion of Earth, and the Doctor, Susan, and Jenny have to stop them.  The Doctor, of course, tries to do it with out mass genocide.  They kill Susan and Jenny, and the Doctor goes totally batshit.  He sees this, and slowly walks into the TARDIS, as though he's given up.  End of Part 1.  Part 2 begins wwith this being replayed.  He the slowly goes through and destroys each Dalek ship.  Then, he materializes on the ship of the Dalek Emperor.  All of the Daleks planetside leave to go aide the Emperor, and witness the final destruction of their greatest enemy.  A collective cheer goes up on Earth, as the Daleks have left, and they are now safe.  The Doctor did it!  But wait, there's still another fifteen minutes left!  What happens then?  The Doctor makes his way to the engine room, and opens a panel on the engine.  He pulls out two wires and, as he does this, the Dalek Emperor appears on a screen(similar to in ""The Parting of the Ways"").  He starts tempting the Doctor(as always), but the Doctor angrily stops him.  He launches into a speech about how the Daleks are the embodiment of Hell and Death.  He then says that they can't exist without each other.  He holds up the wires, moving them closer and closer to each other.  Te Emperor screams at him in terror, ""*Doctor!  Stop, Doctor!  Doc-tooooor!!!*""  The Doctor doesn't stop, uttering one final word- ""*Exterminate.*""  With that, he touches the wires together, and the ship explodes.  The Daleks have finally been erased from the universe, but the Doctor wasn't spared.  It is, however, the way he would've wanted it-destroying the Daleks, and leaving the universe in relative peace.  The camera goes back to Earth, and the explosion is visible from the surface.  The camera goes back to space, and the TARDIS is floating in space, the doors ajar.  The console is dark, it has died without the Doctor.  It drifts down to Earth, and lands on the corner where he sent Rose all those years ago.

true,BrownNote,eccleston,Eccleston,"Besides the drumming, those are less ""plot holes"" and more ignoring physics and reason.  As opposed to Moffat's actual holes:

Having to deal with the backlash of huge events like Canary Wharf, Gallifrey returning then disappearing... essentially all the big hits RTD made during finales.  Instead of actually dealing with them or ignoring them, he just wrote them out as ""time can be rewritten"".

Dealing with humanity's response to the events in his episodes.  Much more of Moffat's stories take place on Earth, yet he doesn't cover how everyone else on Earth is going to deal with the knowledge of alieans.  Hell, I'm expecting his screwdriver to become a Men In Black memory eraser next season.

His writing is definitely a lot looser, made for a more action oriented audience.  While Doctor Who obviously isn't ""hard"" science fiction by any means, RTD took efforts to make sense of everything and have explanations.  The whole ""timey wimey"" excuse, even if it was written in his era (but by Moffat, amusingly) was never really employed.  In Moffat's era, however, instead of explaining things we have the standard ""Time can be rewritten"", ""The Doctor lies"", the sonic screwdriver, or the good ol' ""Timey Wimey"" devices.  I'd say the only major plot hole that RTD left was River Song, and Moffat did do a wonderful job covering that.  I just wish he had the same amount of creativity covering everything else.

TL;DR/Summary: What you described RTD doing was ignoring physics for the sake of heroic story.  Those aren't plot holes, but they definitely can be bothersome.  Moffat straight up creates plot holes and fills them with deus ex machina.",0,1357762697,null,0,false,0,c7tzld0,t3_1690pj,t1_c7tzld0,t1_c7tytg1,null,1430908165,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0

* Before 1997, we had a surplus (in terms of government revenue &gt; government expenditure). 
* From 1997 to 2007 expenditure grew faster than revenue. To keep up with demand and to keep revenue incoming Brown sold a vast amount of our gold stocks (when gold was at a record low). 
* Tax evasion was not cracked down on hard enough.
* Too many people claimed benefits fraudulently
* The global financial crisis of 2008 wasn't to do with the government. It was to do with the banks lending irresponsibly, but the government allowed this with too little regulation. However, what made it hit the government so hard, was that by 2008, it was borrowing heavily (to continue with its reckless expenditure) and so when the banks started going under, they refused to loan out except at horrific rates. So we had to borrow more money to pay back and it became a vicious circle.

I may be wrong on some points. It would be good to see an article that outlines it.

true,Mondoshawan,null,null,"&gt;  outside of Reddit there is quite vehement love / hate relationship with the English that's best on display during Old Firm games and forums across the internet.

Very true, but those people are still very much in the minority and almost all of the country looks down upon them. I used to support Rangers &amp; and stopped many years ago because I wanted nothing to do with them. 

&gt; If people think loyalists are bad, they should read the ramblings of vehemently anti-english neds.

The issue is inflation- they could print another £100bn this year and all it may do is push inflation, where essentially the value of that increased amount of money in the system is negated by the loss of its value. Plus it is very hard to get that extra currency into the hands of the people at the bottom- it tends to end up in the hands of people that move money around. Also it doesn't necessarily make it easier to pay the national debt back, as lenders will start lending at a higher rate if they feel the value of the capital they will get back will be lower due to the currency being worth less.

The bank definitely don't want a fresh program right now, as the government's 'funding for lending' scheme and the business bank, designed to offer an alternative to banks that wouldn't lend, appears to be having a very strong impact. To pour more money into the system would take purchasing power out of businesses, as well as hitting workers in the pocket as their pay packet loses value against inflation.

It's not because the BoE are dickheads that they don't want to print more money than they are right now, you have to remember examples like Germany and Zimbabwe- QE is an emergency measure, not a regular measure.",0,1357766732,null,0,false,0,c7u124p,t3_168r3s,t1_c7u124p,t1_c7tummt,null,1430908874,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

You cannot punish those have a job but still cannot afford to live from it by taking away the money they need to live, which is what happens when the rise in inflation is higher than the rise in their benefits.

the rise in inflation hits everyone, so I disagree. those in work have to cut their cloth accordingly, there is no justification for a higher increase for benefit claimants whilst those paying for it are having to cut back. also, you're now quibbling over a 2% difference (1% is what they're getting, 3% is what you'd like to see) - how much is that exactly, in cash terms?

true,CJ709,present,,"Cheers for sharing this. Made for a good read while I avoid revision and watch Chelsea stutter to a 1-0 loss to Swansea (as it stands). For those who don't want to read it here are the highlights.
  
THE GOOD:  
- We sold Zhirkov (Anzhi), Rajkovic (Hamburg), Da Costa (PSG) and Anelka (Shanghai) for a total of £28.8 mil. Safe to say a lot of that was from Zhirkov which is great business.   
- Turnover did increase by around 14%, but that is a very short term gain (Turnover increased by £38.0 mil, to £257.5 mil).  
- Total salaries did drop to £171 mil from £189.5 mil.  
- These last two factors results in our wage/turnover dropping nicely from 0.84 in 2011 to 0.66 in 2012. That figure is astoundingly good for a club as big as Chelsea. But, alas, it is going to be short-lived.   
- We also gave £613,297 in charitable donations, which was quite nice of us I think.
  
THE BAD:   
- These figures are inflated by the success in the CL. By rough calculations, from the group stage through to winning the final is worth accumulatively £20.11 million. Obviously the chance of us winning it back-to-back was low so we were not going to see a chunk of that money again anyway, but dropping £20.11 million in turnover is going to be tough to take. (I know the Europa League is worth some money, but peanuts in comparison)  
- Finishing higher than 6th will get us some extra cash, but no more than around £3-5 mil, not enough to make up for the short-fall.   
- Some of the 'profit' was the breakdown of a deal with Sky Media that meant we got £15 mil back that we didn't count on.   
  
THE UGLY/CONCLUSIONS
- We will make a loss this financial year.   
- Turnover will drop by at least £20 mil (I predict)  
- Sadly, we do need to get rid of some of the higher earners. Our wage/turnover figure will jump back up to around 0.8+ next year, which is not sustainable.  
- I do not believe we are currently in a position to survive as a club without Abramovich yet - which is something I think needs to be a central goal.   
  
However, we are going in the right direction. Also, with FFP we are allowed to make a loss of £40 mil over the three year period. This positive (barely) year gives us more freedom in the coming too. Something else to not is the ridiculous number of partnerships we have made this year. What the club has been doing is getting the partners to pay all costs within their industry (Gazprom pays our gas bills, Delta pays our flights etc.) which will make our expenses drop somewhat. Can't imagine how expensive Stamford Bridge is to power!  
  
TL;DR - The club is being well run but this year current year is not going to be as good as the one published above. NOTE: It doesn't really matter. Prem TV rights are going to increase which will help us out, and we are one of the clubs that helped structure the FFP, we know what we need to do to meet them.",0,1357767314,null,0,false,0,c7u1a30,t3_168xs8,t1_c7u1a30,t3_168xs8,null,1430908960,4,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,4

true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","Ex-Jessops employee here. I used to work there a few years ago. I left when I moved on and up to better things (and when they cut my hours from 30 hours a week to just 4). Anyhow, I can comment on a couple of things here...

&gt; They overcharged on a lot of their stock

As a company Jessops makes very *very* little on camera and lens sales. The markup is tiny and there's hardly any profit in it (so selling a more expensive camera doesn't matter as much as selling *add-ons* does - that means an extended warranty, batteries, SD/CF cards, case, tripod, filters etc. - that's where the money is made in camera sales). 

However, they were trying to do this as e-retailing boomed - anyone with half a brain would come in, try the camera and then go and buy it in an online store. Hell the only reason I didn't do that when I was buying things whilst working there was down to my staff discount. 

If Jessops had dropped the price on its camera bodies / lenses etc. to compete with online stores - it would've made a loss. That equipment takes up a lot of space and making sure secure cabinets are available to house the cameras for viewing etc. all costs money. Look at it from that point of view - they couldn't afford to. 

&gt; and their staff (at least in local shops near me) were never especially knowledgeable.

Heh... luck of the draw I'm afraid. In *our* store we had two guys who shot weddings and portraits professionally in the area - one of which is now working with Boy George and Toyah Willcox (amongst other things). Then they had me - a fair bit younger than the two I mention above but I'd shot a couple of paid weddings and relish one conversation in which a couple of elderly ladies asked me (with scorn in their tone) ""Ah, yes young man, is there anyone who actually knows about cameras here?"". 

I spent a happy 15 minutes asking them if they had any special aperture requirements for the lens of the camera they wanted to buy, whether they needed manual settings, special ISO settings etc. - they had a little more respect after that. 

Point being; it sounds like you may have lucked out getting some folks in there who were inexperienced. It happens. But I'll tell you what - I appreciate the criticism. If you come into a camera store, you'd expect the staff to know *something* about the products being sold to a certain level.

There is no difference in the use of the deposit it is your money, it can only be used by the landlord as a security for damages. But there is no third party to adjudicate the rights and wrongs. and no fixed time scale for repayment. The only recourse for unfair deductions is the small claims track of the court.

It's a bit hard to reference as it's essentially negative, but you are not covered by the landlord and tenancy act 1988 or the housing act 2004. Which is where ASTs and deposit protection come from.

But definitely get some proper advice, procedures can be important if you need to got to small claims.

true,neon,colin-baker,Colin Baker,"I am really sorry but the comments in this thread, have me really depressed.  And make me more then ever realize that this Doctor Who subreddit is really just a new series subreddit.

For those confused here, big finish is a small company that for 14 years now, and well before the series came back at all has been producing full cast doctor who audio plays starring the original cast members.  They make stories for all the living classic doctors 4-8 starring the original actor's companions and villains even.  Along with new companions, villains as well.

They are known primarily for GREAT writing at times, and also for giving Paul Mcgann a chance to really develop the 8th doctor in tons of stories.  They also have given poor colin a must needed boost in reputation as well, as the 6th doctor is largely seen as the best on audio.

Big finish as mentioned does not have the rights to anything in the new series, though they are co creating a line this year of 11 audio stories with a separate company that will cover the ENTIRE series, and already has linked the first and 11th doctors in the first story.  This line though are not full cast plays but rather, more stories being read by a single actor type affair.

But seriously these guys are brilliant and anyone who hasn't listened needs to go fix that right away.  I suggest the line of 8th doctor adventures for new series fans, as its more in the style of the new series.",0,1357769219,null,0,false,0,c7u1zg7,t3_16979b,t1_c7u1zg7,t3_16979b,null,1430909298,152,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,152

true,thewaitaround,k9,K-9,"11 does have a new outfit. Gone are the suspenders and sportcoat, now (or at least in every picture I've seen of the new episodes) he wears a longer black coat with a vest underneath, a decidedly less modern look. I dug it until I saw a picture of him standing next to modern-day Clara. The previous outfits (particularly Tennant's) were effective in that they always seemed to fit in with the surroundings, and even when they didn't, they at least didn't stand out enough to be a distraction. From what I've seen of 11's new outfit up against modern Clara's, he looks genuinely out of place.

As far as answering the original question, I think it's impossible to say what the next Doctor's look should be, because it is dependent entirely on who is going to play the next Doctor.

We seem to find comfort in finding scapegoats for everything. Why can't we admit, for once, that the opposition played with greater purpose and determination than us? Sure, Torres was bad in the first 80 mins but then Mata, Hazard, Ramires all missed sitters. The five super-midfielders gave away the ball at least three times each. We could not absorb the pressure that the Swans put for 90 minutes. Heck, we could not get the ball into the box most of the time! Not to mention the mostly useless long shots...

Brana? Poor guy had a terrible day. Everyone does, once in a while. We couldn't stop praising him and his 6 goals until the last game. Look at some of us turn on him today. 

Oh yeah, Ba and Lamps did more in 10 min than Torres in 80? You could say the same about Mata, Hazard and Oscar, right?

None of you seem to have spotted the one thing we really missed.  

Moses. 

Look back at some of the previous games. Those assists by Mata, Hazard, Oscar? See how many of them had a Moses touch. Be surprised. 

We did not do better specifically because Ba came on. We did better because Marin came on. Ba coming on with Marin meant 2 things: Width for the team and a clear, precise target for the crosses. 

Don't get me wrong. Marin did jack shit in terms of actual play. But he helped exploit the flanks much better than any of Hazard, Mata and Oscar. The latter three crowd the box with Torres and as a result, the crossers never know where exactly to send the cross. Too many cooks spoil the broth and all that. Had Marin started with Torres, we just *might* have seen a different game. 

Then again, a match in which Luiz is our 'best' player surely needs serious self-introspection by the entire team... 

Credit to the Swans, they pressed like he'll, defended for their lives and took their chances. Well, they got them handed on a silver platter but what matter is that they TOOK it. We didn't.

In fairness rather than just coming out and saying their policy is that it's a waste of time, they've actually said they think it's a waste of time but they'd put it to a Royal Commission.  That in itself is pretty fair enough.  It's a public inquiry so it's not like they're trying to hide anything.

&gt;Would a UKIP science jury accept this?

Well it wouldn't be a UKIP science jury, would it.  It'd be a proper investigation chaired by a Lord tasked with impartiality, and quite possibly an ex-judge.  It's actually the Head of State that appoints a Royal Commission on request of the government.

&gt;If UKIP truly were willing to make data/evidence-based policy, they would lose their anti-Europe rhetoric, and most of their identity.

Oh, come on.  Europe can't even balance its books or say where the Commission spends the money, nobody knows where trade actually ends up, hence the Rotterdam Effect, and the data/evidence is very much open to interpretation.

&gt;It can't be easy to offer support to UKIP on Reddit. I should know, being Tory elitist scum. Or something.

I've actually previously openly said that I'm for the UK remaining in the EU but renegotiating terms, and a large supporter of a two-tier Europe.

I'm only speaking out in this manner because the argument and commentary so far has been so dishonest.  Nobody appears to interested in forming an informed opinion.  It's more like what stories can people make up and pass amongst themselves until they stick.  

It's descending almost to a US level of politics, or the flipside of the banana-bending regulation vendors.

Roman has to realise this is a failure worse the Shevchenko. atleast he had the excuse that the coach didn't want him and that he had never played in england. Abramovich has to cut his losses and sell Torres (with luck, there's a Russian club who might be willing to give  million.) If Torres remains for the rest of the season, it'll be cringeworthy.

He was a great player, but that injury at the World Cup damaged him in a way that will never make him the same. Especially mentally.

The main reason people are opposed is because it would bring house prices down. The whole policy of a green belt actually doesn't solve the problem it claims to solve.

The problem with the undeveloped brown zones is people don't want to be squeezed even tighter into cities. The correct solution is a trade of green zones for brown zones. Allow empty/unused brown field sights to go undeveloped. Develop green zones in replacement. This reduces space pressure because the new green zones become recreational spaces and allows developed zones to be more tightly focused. It also reduces the distance most people have to green areas. Finally some green zones make more sense in terms of locations while brown sites are brown for a reason. You end up with a patchwork system rather than a constrictive belt.

Torres needs to recognize that Mata, Hazard and Oscar are all *miles* more talented than he is currently, and instead of trying to dribble 4 people every chance he gets with the ball, he should make runs to open space for them or offer them an option in the box for them.

It is broken in your eyes because you do not understand it, this is a shame, but it does not mean that the system is broken. It is a fully functioning measurement system that makes sense as long as it is explained once. It is ridiculous to say it is broken, because if it was broken, there would be chaos on the roads. 

There is no harm in running two systems of measurement. Most of people manage it all day, everyday.

They are surging in the polls because people are fed up of lib/lab/con, not because of their policies.

There is no real prior electoral successes for people to judge them by.

I wrote this in a thread earlier this week: 

""Listen, I understand that there are always going to be Torres supporters, and that's great, that's your prerogative. The thing you need to understand as Torres supporters is that Chelsea Football Club is about the CLUB more than ANY player. We have supported him long and hard, but he simply hasn't given the Club a return on the investment, whether it be through scoring goals or just general attitude. He always acts the victim, and frankly, most of us are sick of it. Now we have (in Ba) what could be a quality striker that can get the CLUB back on track, and that is exciting.""

So by all means, support Torres, he certainly needs it, but don't attack Chelsea fans because, right now, Torres is not helping the club win games, whether it be in the EPL or the Capitol One Cup, and quite frankly, most of us don't want to risk results to help his seemingly shattered confidence.

Most of us would rather see Chelsea get *some* type of value by selling him now over getting very little for him later, since he is only getting older and shows no signs of proving any more valuable than his current standing.

unfortunately it's a can of worms - moving to a continental legal system would be contrary to our implicit traditional rights, and it's a slippery slope:



How our law differs from that of Continental Europe

Our Common Law, as far back as 1215 with Magna Carta, states that a citizen can only be judged by his peers (Section 39). These rights protect the individual against arbitrary conviction and imprisonment. Our Common Law recognises several vital rights to the citizen:

The right of Habeas Corpus (that the accused must be taken to a public court within a very short period of time, usually 24 hours, and the accusers must produce their evidence then and there)

The right to Trial by Jury at which jurors can in fact even disregard the law if they think it would give an unjust conviction. The jurors are thus ‘sovereign’
If found innocent, the accused cannot be tried again on the same charge (‘double jeopardy’)

In other words our process is 1) suspicion,2) investigation, 3) arrest, 4) charge

Under the Continental system, know as the Inquisitorial System (often loosely referred to as the Napoleonic system) things are quite different:

In Europe the sequence of events is 1) suspicion, 2) arrest, 3) investigation and 4) charge. In other words the citizen can be arrested and imprisoned without anyone having to produce any evidence against him. There is therefore:

No Habeas Corpus so one can be imprisoned for very long periods (weeks, months, occasionally years) without any evidence being produced against you

No right to Trial by Jury as their system involves judgements being made by a career judiciary who are the judges and prosecutors and who are, to all intents and purposes, ‘colleagues’ (a quite separate body of lawyers makes the defence and are often treated as inferiors)

In most instances the accused can be tried a second time for the same offence, since the prosecution has the right of appeal against acquittal.

The sanctioning of legal arrangements is no business of the government? 

If the suggestion is there should be no such legal arrangement between two people to make a household which is formally recognised for legal purposes that is all well and good, however it would be THAT which is at odds with centuries of history and social practice, not any changes to the role churchmen in the process, which is a relatively novel side story which developed between the early modern period and the 19th century (and heavily tempered by civil administration after the mid 18th century)

The central point is that suggesting the government gets out of marriage, and leaves it to churches seems utterly backward, given both the modern reality, and the history, of it as an institution.

The untempered Schism is an access point on Gallifrey so they probably used it somehow over billions of years as a species. Omega was sucked into the collapsing star and sent to an antimatter universe, we find that out in the classic Who episode ""The Three Doctors"". Rassilon discovered true immortality as referenced in the 20th anniversary special ""The Five Doctors"", but apparently at some point the Time Lords somehow forced him to kind of be ""dead"" at the tower in the Death Zone on Gallifrey, even though he apparently can't really die due to the ring of Rassilon.

Since there seems a ton of confusion as to what NEW things we are getting for the 50th I thought I would quickly recap whats been confirmed.  This is all just off the top of my head.

8 new normal episodes of the new series aka Second half of series 7.

A 50th TV special to air in November, probably on actual 50th day. 

New TV documentary, showcasing the development of the original show

The above 50th special by Big Finish, celebrating the whole classic era.

A new line of 11 audios made by audiogo and big finish, one for each doctor, that links the new and old series.

A series of 11 short novels by famous children and young adult authors, again one for each doctor.

He obviously doesn't know how to motivate, the team selection was wrong, and one if his mistakes, a certain no. 9, was on far too long.

That said the players were pretty awful and the blame is at their door equally if not more; don't think one of them had a good day, many had bad ones. Luiz is not a good midfielder, the last few weeks have shown us that. Mata was no where near his best, Hazard was anonymous.  Enough has been said of Torres, I for one would be happy to never see him put on the Chelsea blue again. 

The chanting for Super Frank was pretty epic, even roused the West Upper to sing (I know as I sat there for the first time ever, they have really nice cushioned seats). Why he did not start and Luiz did I don't know. After the match people were pissed off, where as against QPR there was more an atmosphere of shock. 'Rafa Benitez you're not wanted here', 'Roman Abramovich is this what you want', 'One Di Matteo' were being sung at the end and the singing continued as people left the stadium. 

Bruce Buck gave a special achievement award to Cech at half time, and it was rather awkward cos he was booed loudly. Almost felt sorry for him.

true,i_sideswipe,,Belfast,"&gt; Say 1% of population = 16k people. I don't think much more than that have been significantly affected.

Taking a longer route home, in this day and age, would significantly affect a large number of people. Just think about it for a moment. You've been in work since before 9am, it's now just after 5pm. You need to go to the shop to get your weekly groceries, you need to prepare and cook the dinner, maybe you have kids so at some point you'll need to help them with their homework or other parenting things. Rush hour, you normally don't get home until close to 7. The delays caused by a protest you'll be lucky if you're home by 9! Bear in mind that a 1 hour closure of a main road can easily cause tailbacks lasting over three hours, and on days like last Friday for example, there may not be an alternate route home because those roads are blocked too. Now, that's just one of those 16,000+ people, the person trying to get home. Then you also have to consider the people people who are working in shops across the province who are suddenly doing less trade because either their customers are stuck in traffic jams elsewhere, or like at Christmas do not want to leave their homes incase they get stuck. So your 1% figure significantly lower than the number of people who are been affected directly and indirectly by these protests. I would say that the figure lies somewhere between 10% and 20% of the population, perhaps more. Also, please don't be naive and ask why these people don't just drive through the protest. We've all seen the pictures and videos of the taxi driver being dragged from his car in Shaftsbury square by protesters for attempting to do the same thing, all for trying to do his/her job and get their passenger to their destination safely.

&gt; Burying your father is.

Woah, where did this come from? And how is it relevant to the current situation? 

&gt; Evidently they believe they will gain little or no support from majority catholic areas. Why is that? Another, pseudo-protestant, internet personality claimed on another thread he felt catholics were more forward looking than their protestant neighbours. How can this be so if their heartlands can't even scrape together an Alliance candidate never mind elect one?

I'm not in the Alliance party, so I can only speculate as to why they are unable to ""scrape together"" more councillors. Personally, I think a significant cause is not that the party doesn't have support, but that most people are politically disinterested beyond voting every 3/4/5 years. 

&gt; What are Alliance doing about it? Taking down the Union flag in Belfast?

Why are Alliance being primarily blamed for this? Surely the anger of the mob should be directed at Sinn Fein and the SDLP, who raised the issue in the first place rather than the party who proposed the middle ground? A middle ground that I feel needs to be pointed out again that Unionists have been happy with in at least one other council area in Northern Ireland, and also a middle ground that puts Belfast City Council on equal footing with the majority of local councils across the rest of the UK.

&gt; Do Alliance believe they'll have any credibility amongst the loyalist community after this debacle?

Yes.

&gt; However, by ignoring the instances of sectarianism elsewhere in NI, where Alliance have chronic under-representation

And how exactly should they, or any political party deal with an issue in an area where they are under-represented, beyond the usual public statements?

&gt; Alliance are at best a self-serving political organisation only interested in superficial compromise in their primary demographic

So, the same as any other political party across the free world?

&gt;Main-stream media analysis is rubbish. The Alliance raised this as an issue to setup an election battle with the DUP, the DUP whipped up the perma-protestors for the same reason and the riots are ongoing in east Belfast because the UVF don't want to stand trial/get arrested. That's it.

Care to explain why main-stream media analysis of this is rubbish? As I said above, the Alliance party did not raise this issue, it was raised by both Sinn Fein and the SDLP in line with the aims and ideals of those parties. 

&gt; True, but then as I've pointed out before we've been dealing with the threat of violence for a long time now.

Not really over the past decade and beyond, especially when compared to what was going on during the Troubles. For close to perhaps the past 15 years, we had been making significant strides to set the violence behind us. The major Republican paramilitary groups had disbanded, if not on a cease-fire. The major Loyalist groups were in the same position. Foreign investors were looking at us as a major source for high skilled, technically minded employees. Both Irish and UK governments were spending public money to help us repair the damage to our infrastructure caused by a rational underdevelopment during the Troubles. There were until several years ago large portions of Belfast City that I would have avoided like the plague, for fear of a group of thugs on either side of the political divide causing trouble. Until the riots began in December, Belfast actually felt like a safe city to live in!

&gt; A lot more than that is currently being spent, and always has been spent, on anti-terror operations post-'peace'. Where is the outcry over this? Have we just come to treat the threat of IRA violence is an acceptable norm?

Sadly, anti-terror operations are a part of modern day life. In London, how much money do you think the Metropolitan Police spend on terror threats, both foreign and domestic? Same in Edinburgh, Cardiff, and any other cities, towns, and villages across England, Scotland and Whales? Hell, what about across the Republic of Ireland, or any other country in the world? This isn't the point. The point is that a small and exceptionally vocal minority have directly contributed a £7 million bill, in policing operations, in little over a month. Surely you can agree that this is an outrage, regardless of who the group is, or what their issue is, and that this money could easily be better spent on other services in the community?

It is clear to me that over the last several comments, and looking at your comment history, you have some sort of grudge or other bad feeling towards the Alliance party. So, lets wind the clock back to the start of December. The two main Nationalist parties on Belfast City Council have proposed for whatever reason that the Union Flag should no longer be flown on council owned property. The three main Unionist parties are obviously opposed to this. How should the party that essentially holds the swing of the vote proceed? Should they abstain, and be potentially perceived as throwing their support indirectly for the Nationalist agenda? Should they outright declare support for either side of the vote? Or should they propose a middle ground between both sides of the issue? Or perhaps you can think of a different option? What would you do, if you were the person incharge of the Alliance councillors?",0,1357784372,null,0,false,0,c7u6q7r,t3_167foe,t1_c7u6q7r,t1_c7txpwr,null,1430911596,3,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,3

I really do think that I should interject here.

You do not have to accept an FPN (fixed penalty notice) the officer can report you to court instead. Its easier to take the FPN though because then that decision is up to you. You can choose to go to court if you want, but you could just pay the fine. If you get summonsed, you have to turn up in court, which, if found guilty could mean a greater fine or points (typically the fine is greater.

* That the problem he's never in any position to receive the ball he's afraid to be the striker  he's always drifting to the wings for no apparent reason. 

&gt;The guy is out of place, he's not suited for Chelsea. When he plays for Spain he gets the Golden Boot.

* He scored 2 against fucking Ireland and 1 in the finals they already won.  
how is he out of place. He used to be a single striker and that exactly what he's doing. Torres is done he have no speed, skill or the eye for goal.

&gt;It's not Torres but Chelsea.

* [Yeah, ok](http://singleblink.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/oh-yeah-sure-sarcasm.gif)

*
&gt;Like Benetiz said this team is transitioning. I don't expect it to end soon because they are once again switching managers at the end of the season.

* We are a transitioning team but that is no excuse for Torres poor performance, he been getting the service but failed to score. We went through too many managers and that havent stop us from winning trophies RDM, Ancelotti, Guus Hiddink. 

&gt;Also our defense is shit.

We have hugely improved under Rafa, Dont blame Ivanovic mistakes today on the overall performance of the defense.
