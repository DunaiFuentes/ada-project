If you have proof in regards to the Student loans it may be possible to delay the eviction when it goes to county court to be heard. Take all the documentary evidence you have especially if there are letters stating that the amount is owed and when it is to be paid. 

Did the Landlord issue a Section 8 notice or a Section 21? If it is a Section 21 then the timing and wording of the notice is super-critical. If the wording was not correct and the Section 21 was not served on the correct date you can use this to get the notice invalidated. The Landlord would have to effectively start again from scratch. 

Now if the Landlord has issued a Section 8 because you're more than 2 months behind with arrears then the same time-critical requirements do not exist.

In both cases if you don't then leave by the expiry of the notice the landlord has to go to court to get a notice of possession. If you still don't leave then the landlord has to go back to court yet again to get a warrant of eviction and it is only at this final step that everything has been exhausted and bailiffs can remove you from the property. Up until that warrant is executed you can stay in the property.

That's a list of all terrorist attacks in the UK. Yes the IRA were active before this but let's see your list of terrorist bombings before this. It will be very thin - or possibly non existent.

&gt; Islamic extremists were active from 2005-2007 (in the UK) in just two attacks

""No"" is not a response. List your examples and we can move on from there. GCSE students would be marked down for a response like that. People died during the miner strikes, the poll tax riots and the Brixton riots. Either you are aware of this or your not, if you aren't then don't try to play some sort of moral high ground as a result. List examples and stop being a Puffoon.

&gt;Indeed, these 'brainless religions goons' committed the largest modern terrorist attack.

Well you're too young to remember the Lockerbie bombing. The IRA attacks. Outside the UK - we have Vietnam, the Cold War, the Second Congo War, Second Sudanese Civil War, Soviet War in Afghanistan, Iran–Iraq War v1, Afghan Civil War, Nigerian Civil War etc etc... so I'll forgive you for your ignorance. 

40-50 years ago the world was a very, very, very violent place. Today it's a sunny walk in the park in comparison. ""Largest"" is not a badge to band about as your own personal philosophical stance.

&gt;Please explain how your knowledge of WW2 affects anything I've written.

Today the biggest threat is climate change which is a long way off from a 4 minute warning that includes entire planet being completely and utterly destroyed. The only reason why you think it's the ""Largest modern terrorist attack"" is because we've managed to stop all that shit in the past 15 years and reduce it to almost ZERO.

That's a big part of what I'm figuring out.

Functionally, I'll probably be using it mainly as an office/library, but mentally I think I want it as a refuge from the TV/computer and the outside world; a place I can truly relax and be creative in. That's why I was thinking that using a corner as, say, a place to paint, or a project space could be cool; I've decided I need more non-digital creative outlets.

That being said, if it's going to be a TARDIS room, it's going to need a command console, and I'm trying to think of a way to integrate one that meshes with the goals above.

My two cents: 

A repeat of January means two impact signings in needed positions for £20 mil. So I'm going to focus on the current state of our squad in terms of the players who I think are capable of playing in a top 4 side. Also I don't think we will be a top 4 side by next January, though I do believe successful summer window followed by a successful January 2014 will be enough to have us finish top 4 next year. Lastly, I like the policy of only signing two or three players because we can give them half a year to prove themselves AND we won't have a crazy flooding of new players like Newcastle currently have.

**Forwards:** Suarez, Sturridge, Borini. 

That's fine for three competitions IMO.

**Wide players:** Downing, Sterling.

A bit slim when compared to the likes of ManU, but I don't think it should be a focus of the summer window considering the wealth of midfielders we have.

**Midfielders:** Gerrard, Henderson, Coutinho, Allen

Each player brings something different to the game which is excellent. My one suggestion would be to have a backup number 10 (perhaps Suso, but I'm not holding my breath).

**Defensive Midfielders:** Lucas

This position is a MUST for the summer window. Lucas might not return to his 11-12 form and even if he does, we need a capable backup. Javi Martinez would be such a dream signing, but that'll never happen.

**Center Backs:** Agger, Skrtel, Wisdom, Kelley, Coates

I'm no expert in judging talent but from what I hear people want to see Wisdom as a center back. I'd rather see him as a fullback and Kelly as a centerback. Nevertheless a starting 11 CB is our second priority.

**Full Backs:** Johnson, Enrique

Enrique needs cover because he is injury prone. A total of four full backs is necessary and with Wisdom, I would say we need one more to be behind Enrique.
This is our third/fourth priority.

**Goal Keppers:** Reina, Jones

I for one, am ok with Bradley Jones. And very very happy to have Reina.

**Summary:** In our current squad, I've named 19 players who I think can be part of a successful Liverpool side. With two good signings in the summer and another two in the winter that brings the total to 23 which is a fine number if you as me. If these positions get filled, the depth chart will look like:

A2 isn't too bad, any good school will show you what you need to do - just remember your shoulder checks in your Mod 1 + 2 and make sure you listen to what your instructors tell you as they really do know how to get you through your test. 

Low cost and good instructors are hard to come by - IMO you're better off spending a little more money on better instructors with better facilities so you pass first time on both tests and don't waste your money re-taking. It's the facilities you pay for but they are most definitely worth paying for as they make the Mod 1 test in particular an absolute breeze - many schools will simply take you to a quiet road to practice your Mod 1 which is not nearly as effective.  

Check to make sure whichever school you are with is located close to a motorcycle test-centre - due to the new Mod 1 requirements, many bike test-centres have closed as they do not have the money to fund the necessary facilities to do the test. As a consequence, you may have to travel upwards of 30 miles to do your test depending on the school and this is a huge pain in the arse as you'll be tired from the long ride to the centre before you've even started your test! Plus, you will not have gone around the test-routes for your Mod 2 if you've never been to the area itself - meaning you're going to be less familiar with them and this might potentially cause trouble during your test. 

So anyway, spend the money and get GOOD tuition. It's worth its weight in gold I promise. ",0,1367373681,null,0,false,0,c9q0zto,t3_1d6ctv,t1_c9q0zto,t3_1d6ctv,null,1431366405,2,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,2

HBA over Sturridge at RW is also tempting if Suarez is playing CF. The problem is that Sturridge is best at CF but isn't better than Suarez there. And Sturridge at CF might be better than HBA at RW but HBA is better at RW than Sturridge at RW.

Coloccini at CB is also iffy. Both him and Skrtel were great last year but disasters at times this year. 

Santon and Jose are pretty much even. Jose for the first half of last season and second half of this has been one of the best LBs in the Prem. Problem is, the two half seasons in between, he was pretty bad. I think the best solution might be Johnson at LB and Debuchy at RB.


So in summary, my Newcastle + Liverpool XI

Plus, I don't mean to sound condescending but if you think we use Dembele to 'take people on with the ball at their feet' then you really misunderstand his role in the team.

His job is NOT to take on opposition players, it's to link defence to attack and to contribute if applicable. To compare him to a Bale or a Lennon is to COMPLETELY misunderstand what his role is.

As things stand, we will probably only have two strikers as of mid-July; Balotelli has already left, and Dzeko is on his way out. With the typical formation we play, there were two strikers (one of whom usually played in the hole as a number 10), Silva and Nasri/Milner drifting in from the wings, Yaya running all over the place, and either Barry or Garica shielding the back four.

While we've been linked with some world class strikers, Cavani appears headed toward PSG more and more, Falcao was never really all that realistic, and Lewandowski appears to have his heart set on Munich.

If this story is true -- I'M NOT SAYING IT IS -- it could mean a switch from the way City have played the last two or three seasons. With similar box to box midfielders like Fernandinho and Yaya, we could see Yaya pushed back into the number 10 he played in his first year under Mancini, with Fernandinho/Rodwell becoming the new box to box mid and Barry/Garcia shielding the back four.

Center midfield would have five first teamers for three roles (Fernandinho, Rodwell, Garcia, Barry, Yaya, with Razak or Suarez available from the academy if everyone dies), the wings would have Silva, Nasri, Milner, and whatever winger we try out next, and Tevez and Aguero would rotate up to, with Guidetti waiting in case they both die too.

No one can absolutely, positively prove that Clara isn't River Song demonstrating some amazing cross-lifetime power that she's never had before. But of course the same thing could be said of anybody: Jenny. Sarah Jane. Adric. Captain Jack. Donna Noble. K-9.

Ah. That's it: Clara is actually K-9 using a holographic projector. The reason she can appear multiple times despite dying is because each one is a different version of K-9: We can assume that we've seen the death of the Mark III (the damaged spare parts of which, kept in the trunk of Sarah Jane's car, were probably captured during the dalek invasion of Earth). The only open question is whether the current Clara is the Mark I or the Mark II: Are we about to see the reappearance of Leela or the reappearance of Romana (who will come looking for their lost pooch)?

true,James188,cnty-uk,Bumpkin Territoy,"It's worth noting that under Home Office Counting Rules, a lot of Assaults are written up as an ABH because they have to be, irrespective of what the charge would have been.

Charging Standards are different; what may initially be called an ABH will likely be charged as Common Assault and classed as ""solved"" under the alternative offence rule.  Charging Standards effectively now say that if someone is likely to get less than 6 months in prison, then just charge common assault so it stays away from crown court, saving the CPS money.

Of course this means that the proportionality of a ""community resolution"" is measured by the Charging Standards yard stick.
 The downside is that crime is recorded (and these stats generated) from the Counting Rules.

The problem with this now arises because a Community Resolution isn't what's known as a sanctioned detection, so the alternate offence rule does not apply. This of course means that the offence remains recorded as an ABH; looking horrendous to the untrained eye, but actually meaning very little.

Also a note on Domestics. As said elsewhere, many are VERY trivial, reports of assaults where A has snatched the remote from B and is watching Hollyoaks instead of Eastenders, and so on. I've used CR on some of these, with a condition that one party leaves to calm down, or watches telly in another room.
The reason here is the blanket policy of ""positive action"", which is of course done for the right reasons.
The problem comes when petty squabble ""technically"" becomes a very minor assault. The balloon goes up, crimes are logged and officers have to cover arse. Try getting a remote snatcher into custody; it's a ridiculous idea, so what better way to clear it up than a CR.

true,Howells122,UA,ukraine,"&gt;but we cannot rely on one right winger

We did when we did the double, (we only had Malouda, and he wasnt even a proper winger) and haven't needed one since then. Why is having wingers such a priority over a stronger more physical midfield all of the sudden? Our fullbacks are the ones that are taking care of the width on the attack anyway, its never Moses or Hazard crossing in, its Cole, Brana, Dave etc. Thats how we have played for the last 5 seasons. 

KDB from what I gather is not a physical presence and pretty much wouldn't help where we are lacking in the midfield. Again he is unproven in England and we can't rely on him to solve our midfield woes. Lets not forget that Marin, who you all are so quick to shit on, was considered a German Messi at Bremen. Who are they claiming is their best player now? Ya, KDB. Let's wait and see how he does in England before we start saying we can play him anywhere on our starting XI. 

I agree we aren't going to make one signing. But that doesn't mean we should go willy-nilly signing any player who is decent. We did that this season and ended up buying too many number 10's and causing an imbalance in our squad. We need to invest smart.

That's why David Luiz works in the midfield because he pushes the ball up and pings it out to our forward players. I do agree we need to strengthen the midfield, but we can always look to our loan players (see: Essien, Chalobah, KDB.)

Okay okay okay, no. Marin was not considered the German Messi during his last 2 seasons at Bremen. His last season or so at Bremen were less than spectacular. To be honest, Marin turned to shit being after Oezil left, and every game I've seen him play this season has been fairly shocking and yes, I do know he was injured but he hasn't been injured all season and when he has played - he's been the same as I saw him when he played in the BuLi. KDB has had a much better season at Bremen compared to Marin's last there.

The thing is though, I believe need wingers. Moses and Hazard can not play every game. Can you see any other wingers avaliable for our squad?

true,Howells122,UA,ukraine,"Fine that's your opinion, but I fail to see why we need a winger.  We haven't used/needed proper wingers since Duff and Robben. We won the CL without them and we were doing fine this season prior to everything going to shit with Clattenburg and Robbie getting sacked. 

The issue with this season is the fact we can't control the midfield.  We lack someone with physical strength to defend and hold the ball, and in addition the ability to create opportunities and move the ball forward, ie a player like Toure/Fellaini/Essien. We don't have a problem scoring, we have a problem with conceding goals, most of those goals result from a loss of control in the midfield. Man City is so strong because of Toure. He OWNS the midfield, something we haven't seen since the Makelele+Essien+Lamps combination. Lamps is leaving. Ramires is wasted at the DM, Oreo is still a question mark, and Mikel can't do it alone. We need a DM, full stop. KDM is an attacking midfielder, not a DM. We don't need someone who *can* play the position, we need someone who dominates the position. 

Essien is too old and injury prone (I love Essien dont get me wrong), Chalobah is way too young to depend on at this stage. I cannot put my faith in an 18 year old, (ie Kakuta, McCecheran, Sinclair, Cork, Bruma, Matic and every other youth player who shows a glimpse of being a good at top the top flight from our youth). Look at Bertrand for Christ sake. Everyone was ranting about how great he was during the CL final, now he is playing like shit. There is a reason why they aren't being chosen in our starting XI. Not because our staff are stubborn, but they know more about those players than we do. They are simply not ready/not good enough. You cannot rush youth players and force them onto the starting XI because they have had a couple good games and expect them to be like Rooney or Messi when they were 18. This isn't FIFA or FM. 

My point is someone who plays well in Bremen does not necessarily mean that he will play well with us. Same goes for Schuerrle. I'm sure Schuerrle and KDB are great in the Bundisliga, but do we need another attacking midfielder/winger?  In my opinion no. 

We need a pure physical striker who can hold the damn ball. Then we need DM who can boss the midfield. ",0,1367388281,null,0,false,0,c9q5u7h,t3_1demz8,t1_c9q5u7h,t1_c9q4zk5,null,1431364052,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

Personally I don't like the legislation because it gives companies a free ticket to do what they like with other peoples' work without having to compensate the little guy. It's in line with 'apprenticeships' at poundland - more power/profit to the companies, less to individual people.

I have nothing against sharing or distributing images, even without attribution to the original creator - although many would prefer it, many professional photographers share their work freely fully expecting the image to 'do rounds' on the Web.

However, with this new legislation, it means that companies can profit from this without compensating the original creator, especially if that creator is obscure enough to be able to hide the origin well enough.

Most people don't want to work for free, and this provides a disincentive for professionals and even hobbyists to share their work with such a wide audience.

The only worthwhile barometer of a party's value is the effort you expend to find out what their policies are. Please be assured that I'm not necessarily including you in this, but I get very tired of people complaining that ""all parties are the same"", or that ""it doesn't matter who you vote for"". It matters hugely who you vote for, assuming you're willing to do the basic work involved in finding out where they stand on the issues that matter most to you. 

Do you follow your MPs questions on theyworkforyou? Do you go to constituent surgeries? Do you follow your MP on Twitter? All of these incredibly simple things give you an opportunity to speak directly to your political representative.

People complain that the parties don't do enough to communicate with the average voter, and that may very well be true. But if the issues are important to you; if you care one jot about your family's welfare and the future of the country you live in; if it's even vaguely important to you that we have more immigration, or less immigration, or more taxation, or more public borrowing, or whatever, you have no excuse for not doing what you're doing right now: looking at things on the internet that will help you make those decisions.

I've also PMed you the email address of the head of the student loans company and the National union of students. Your mother needs to send a polite but firm email today asking for help and explaining the situation. 

If your MP has not met your requirements you need to do something, to be ignored is unacceptable. Try to book a surgery (the MPs website will give you the number PM me if you need help), contact the MPs party and also speak to your local councillors and MEPs.  

CAB and shelter are worth given a call to, if they have a local lawyer that can advise you ask for that. Also speak to your local council about a hardship loan as it will be cheaper to support you in your home than pay out for accommodation for someone that is homeless, point out that this is unintentional homelessness and you are doing your best.  

If you and your sister are still children then the council has to accommodate you, they may well try and wait until your homeless but try to politely argue that it is cheaper for them to support you in your home now. 

As time is short you need to delay, speak to the landlord and explain the actions you are taking, explain to them that this is an issue that you are acting on and are doing your best, however you need time. 

Contact as many people as you can over this as you need to ensure that you cannot get ignored, get hold of the complaints procedure of every organisation you are dealing with and do a web search to find the email addresses of the head of the organisation and contact them, CC these emails to the head of the council and your MP and you will get people moving. 

Give strong consideration to contacting the local press, an MP that ignores a family about to be evicted just as elections are about to happen is a great story and may well end your MPs career. This is a double edge sword so do not take that action lightly, an MP has a duty to represent everyone in their constituency if they are not the electorate needs to know so they can make an informed decision at the polls. 

And in all of this be polite and well-spoken but firm, this is not right, you are not at fault so why are you suffering and why are those that are employed to support you and your family consider it appropriate to ignore you? 

Good Luck and please pm me if I can help.

The admins are never going to do this, however - they're obviously quite happy with things as they are.

In my opinion, reddit will come to an end in one of two ways.  Either 1) the admins will preside over a Digg-style clusterfuck that will drive 50% of redditors off the site overnight, or 2) someone will start a rival site that has the same features as reddit but without the downvote-enforced circlejerks.

I think that as a result a lot of the business investment the government gives are the bottom of the barrel picks, and often smell more of idealism or corruption than good economic sense.

Even something as simple as infrastructure investment is difficult, something like CrossRail despite pretty much everyone considering it long overdue, is still seen as many people as favouritism for London.

The other issue is where does that money come from?  If its from external investment, is it possible that it will undercut or rob if you will private ventures of funding?  I can't find it here (work sorry, only getting to write this because VS crashed!) but there was an interesting study done on this.

So I really don't think Keynesian stimulus is a magic bullet, I think it very much has its place, but on a case by case basis.  Jumping up and down to say ""no cuts, spend instead"" is frankly stupid, because cutting is easy, choosing what to spend on that generates a good return, very, very hard.  I might believe them if they were some serial entrepreneur.  I also think many people are very mistaken on what keynesian is, using a terrible selection bias to suite their world views.  (See post above that labels countries as black and white keynesian, I think most Swedish people would disagree with that, at least the ones I've met in business).

To sum up my opposition to Keynesian, its simple fear, I am scared it will be done badly, and make things worse.  When in no possession of clear data, I always choose the more well known pain, over a potentially worse one.",0,1367400035,null,0,false,0,c9q7mwu,t3_1df2hy,t1_c9q7mwu,t1_c9py6hv,null,1431363205,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Just because they haven't succeeded yet, doesn't mean they won't. The fact that many states are so intent on developing nukes is reason enough to maintain our capabilities.

&gt;Tell me nukes are used less than drones and i'll concede my point. 

Nukes are used less than drones. Nukes are very rarely used. I have no idea why you are banging on about drones because they are a completely different kettle of fish. Drones perform a completely different function to nuclear bombs.

Even the US doesn't have sufficient drone capability to ""remotely bastardize anyone"". They work in places like Afghanistan where there aren't any defenses but in traditional warfare they aren't capable at all. A single pilot in a jet from the 80s could pop off a whole squadron of drones.

Drones in the end will only ever be as good as the best fighter pilot or the best bomber. The only difference is that they are unmanned so can be sent into dangerous areas without fear of losing someone. So tell me how much of a threat is a fighter jet or bomber in this day and age?

For my two penneth worth, Having worked in nightclubs in the North during the early 90's, many of the managers were of a generation that had worked in the clubs during the 60's, i.e Saviles years and it was common to hear the running joke that if the door staff (or bouncers as they were then) seemed to have let in too many obviously underage girls they would say words to the effect of "" fucking hell, is Jimmy Saville getting a share of the door tonight"", we all knew he wasn't right but it was seen as a joke, a rumour that was joked about but never discussed, no more harmfull than saying Hitler had only one ball.

true,M2Ys4U,eu,Manchester,"&gt;They want a maximum 10-year copyright term (reduced to 5 years for closed-source software). To put that in perspective Microsoft's Windows 7 would be public domain next October and Linux Kernel v2.4 backwards would be PD now (for any company to use without giving credit and, more importantly, code back to the community), that just seems mental to me. While lengthening the term to 10 years for open-source works is nice, I don't think it should be up to the government to incentivise licencing a work under one licence over another.

While that was in the older manifesto, the [new one](https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/media/uploads/Manifesto2012.pdf) doesn't make any distinction between closed or open source. This is the current policy on copyright length:

&gt;We will reduce the duration of copyright to 10 years, closer to the original duration of 14 years, reflecting the much greater ease with which works can now be made and distributed.

&gt;Shorter copyright will encourage artists to keep on creating new work; will allow new art forms, such as mash-ups; and will stop big businesses from relying on large back-catalogues rather than investing in new content. 

&gt;Our 10 year copyright length will include within it a renewal after 5 years, allowing works in which the creator is no longer interested to fall into the public domain after 5 years.

true,TheEvilScotsman,scottish,Scotland,"The Swedes use a different model that bears some relation to Keynesian economics if I remember rightly, I'll check if I can find a link but I'm sure I read that before. [Verified, turns out the Stockholm school has similarities to Keynes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_school_(economics)) so it is occasionally misinterpreted as being inspired by him though similar conclusions to his were developed independently. 
The problem with Keynes, as with most economists, is that his ideas are always interpreted through a political angle so fall down when favouritism comes into play. To do a better application of him which is closer to his model would be very difficult since certain aspects of policy would be unpopular. London's preferential position when it comes to government spending is definitely something which irks a lot of people, I was irked by it but then came to the conclusion it's economics and there's no intentional malice in it. It does grate though when the amount Scotland gets is called into question but nobody seems to be bringing up that London gets more spending, the spending in Scotland is just a scapegoat for the uneven economic development in the North of England versus the South - which gets more money invested in it.

Keynes definitely isn't a magic bullet and correct application of him would have to be in the long-term, which is unpopular with politicians who are in it for the votes. I wouldn't say there should be no cuts, since there are areas where there could be efficiency savings, but I think before any cut is made there should be a proper consideration of what effect this will have on the economy at large. Every cut hurts somebody, but more than this is lowers the rate of consumption with negative effects on retail (a sector which is not helped by the VAT hike) and can prove particularly disastrous for small business owners who cannot compete with the far larger companies for whom the increase means little as their scale allows them to easily take these hits.

In short, I recognise the difficulties of Keynesian economic policy. It is important to remember however that targeted stimuli could be used to increase consumption, I'd recommend a significant drop in VAT over the next few years since this has marked effects on growth. This growth will lessen the need to cut in ways that effect the poorest, and disabled, least.

This is a wider problem with piss poor badly research rumours being turned into stories that spread across media outlets. One outlet writes a crap story, then the next day 2 more pick it up and run with it, by day 3 it is on the back pages of newspapers. It's then credited as if it is a factually based rumour when it is simply one idiots view of a situation that has been amplified by more idiots reproducing it. 

They need to fill pages and they often fill them with shit. the language they use, tells a story itself.

suggesting ... may be ongoing ...!

~~If you replace the photograph with a drawing or painting that imitates the photograph and then apply the same transforms, I'm pretty sure you're OK.~~ ([See reply by DoorsofPerceptron](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1dh133/law_question_can_i_legally_modify_and_use_photos/c9qwb50)).

I'm curious just how far this goes given modern technology, though. For example if you use a graphics program to create a vector tracing of a photograph, is that a derivative work (because the reproduction is automatic) or not (because there's some art in specifying appropriate parameters to the tracing engine to get a desired effect)?

In practice, I suspect the photographer would have a hard time proving the vector artwork was automatically traced rather than drawn by a person anyway - and a vector artist might have a tough time proving he *didn't* use an automatic trace. There's probably a fuzzy line (practical if not legal) between derivative works and inspired works.

true,simonask,eu,Danish guy in UK,"&gt; 30 years ago, the EU didn't exist.

30 years ago was 1983. The EU was established with the Treaty of Paris in 1952 (although with a different name). The institution we know as the EU is 61 years old this year.

&gt; It's not warmongering to suggest that this peacetime might not last forever.

The reason it's completely unrealistic is that there is no imaginable scenario where anyone would have anything to gain from another European war. Time is infinite, the Earth has a good few billion years to go, so of course there will once again be war on the soil we know today as Europe. But it will not in our lifetimes, nor our children's, or our children's children.

War doesn't happen the moment it becomes unprofitable. We are much more entangled than you Brits seem to realise. Half your groceries are likely produced in some other EU country, and *all* of them have certainly had elements of their production influenced by products from other EU countries.

&gt; Whereas Europe has been at war with each other almost constantly until the end of WW2. How many empires have risen and fallen here? Hundreds? How many times have the borders changed as countries merged, became independent or were conquered?

How many of those empires have been liberal democracies? How many of them have valued trade over conquest?

&gt;  I'd say that the 3rd largest economy leaving would present a significant problem for the EU.

Yes, but it also isn't going to happen. It would be *catastrophic* for the UK economy. No less. The core EU countries have no motive to cater to the interests of a UK not in the union, and it's likely that most financial activity would be moved from London to Paris or Frankfurt am Main. UK exporters would no longer have restriction-free access to the largest market on the planet.

The UK would be forced to really consider what there is to be gained from non-membership, and it turns out: Not really anything at all. It might satisfy some idiotic notion of national pride or post-imperialistic nostalgia, but in all practical terms it would be no less than catastrophic.",0,1367408474,null,0,false,0,c9q8m72,t3_1dgj43,t1_c9q8m72,t1_c9q8cxv,null,1431362743,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Damn, I'm sure you didn't meant to come off as condescending, but you did. You make it sound like we *owe* society something for the great gift of... what? We all pay taxes, in one way or another. If it wasn't you personally paying taxes for most of your life then your parents were certainly paying taxes for you, on everything they ever bought for you, on all the council tax, on all the national insurance they paid.

We aren't obliged to owe anyone anything. We may *choose* to give extra, but that's up to the goodness of our own hearts and our conscience. But we shouldn't feel it necessary just to get a basic job.

Unfortunately I understand how the job market works. It *should* be where the only necessary experience required for flipping burgers should be flipping burgers, but when an employer gets 1,000 applications for a single burger flipping job you have to differentiate some how, and that usually means having a degree from Oxford and having been on a ""save Africa"" tour.

You have a meeting with the agency beforehand talking about what you are looking for and your strengths and they are either happy with that or send you to their client for further interview. If you don't like the role just say so - anything along the lines of ""This is not practical"" or ""Doesn't suit my skills"" it's fine. 


Pay is usually ok for administrative work and most of my coworkers were surprised to hear I was earning more than them - It evens out though as they get holiday pay and all that as you will not be (most likely).


In terms of security it depends on your role, my contract was reinstated a few times as they liked my contributions then one day they said -""yep thanks a lot bye."" With little warning of usually a week but it works both ways as you can leave with a weeks notice too. If you ask the agency for a a certain duration (1 month, 6 months etc) you may have a better chance of security.

On the question of dependency, I believe the situation is: we rely on the US for SLBM launch vehicles. We make our own warheads for those vehicles. The physics packages and cores in those warheads are of US origin. Clearly we can't make an SLBM quickly or economically, but we could probably make our own cores and WE177 free fall bombs in a few months as a crash programme if absolutely necessary. We no longer have any bombers, which probably means that the Tornado is the only viable delivery system in the short term, which would probably limit the use of nuclear weapons to the tactical role because of range limitations (the WE177 could be built in tactical and strategic ranges).

They also seem to have a complete misunderstanding of basic maths, which would preclude any economic sense - e.g. ""[The coalition boasts it has cut the annual deficit by 25%, yet any school boy with a calculator can work out to reduce national debt the reduction needs to be 125% otherwise it continues to grow.""](http://www.ukip.org/content/ukip-policies/2993-ukip-proposed-tax-policy) - this suggests we need a significant surplus to shrink the debt, when actually running a slight deficit could still see a *reduction*, albeit not to 0.

It's also nothing to do with passports or international travel. As a member of the European Union, a British passport entitles you to the same privileges as any other European passport. It doesn't prevent you from filling in the documentation for visiting the States, for example, or most Asian countries.

In one case children had schools available, but the parents didn't let them go. The volunteers went to the markets where they worked and started their learning, and within 6 months most of the children had enrolled in education.

I'd rather do that than carry on with another 3 months in day to day work, when I have the rest of my life for that.

true,Thetonn,eng-sussex,Sussex,"There are two big reasons why people are annoyed about aid.

Firstly, aid is paid out of taxes. Money forcibly taken from us without our consent by a central government which is not going to help the British Citizens which the state has a duty to protect but non-citizens a long way away. This means that the state is doing something which is morally right rather than citizens. This is problematic because Rich people and taxpayers can then say that the state has furfilled their moral obligations through taxation and they don't have to give any more to the poor. Counties like the US which made charitable giving tax deductable, empowering the individual to spend a lot more on help to poorer countries tend to have higher rates of giving and more effective aid.

The second reason is of course effectiveness. We give money to Ethiopia which still relies on patronage networks to govern itself, resulting in massive amounts of corruption and waste which just goes to keep oppressing locals. We educate women in a society so dominated by men that they end up with highly educated housewives unable to leave the home. When the state spends money it is to create the image of success rather than achieve proper goals.

Aid is just another vanity project like the arts and sport. It is a relatively small lobbying group which demands a lot of money from the state which it is given by governments hoping for good press. I'm pretty sure if we let the general public choose aid programs they would abolish it in favour of making it more tax deductable in the same manner they would vote to abolish subsidies for middle class opera goers, but governments don't give them that choice.",0,1367414253,null,0,false,0,c9q9ogh,t3_1dh8d3,t1_c9q9ogh,t3_1dh8d3,null,1431362171,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

You have brains in your head.

I have two hearts in my chest.

I can steer us all 

in the direction that's best.


You're not on your own. And you know what you know.

But sometimes YOU are the person who'll decide where to go.


Look up and down these dates. Look 'em over with care.

About some you will say, ""I don't choose to go there.""

With your head full of brains and your ready for fate,

you're too smart to go to any not-so-good date.


And you may not find any

you'll want to go to.

In that case, of course,

The TARDIS will know what to do.


It's opener there

in the wide open space.


Out there things can happen

and frequently do

to people as brainy

and footsy as you.


And then things start to happen,

don't worry. Don't stew.

Just go right along.

You'll know what to do.


OH!

THE TIMES AND PLACES WE'LL GO!


You'll be on your way up!

You'll be seeing great sights!

You'll join the high fliers

who soar to high heights.


You won't lag behind, because you'll have the speed.

We'll pass right on by Torchwood and soon take the lead.

Wherever we fly, you'll be best of the best.

Wherever you go, you will top all the rest.

Except...when we don't.

Because, sometimes, we won't.

I'm so, so sorry to say so

but, sadly, it's true

that Bang-ups

and Hang-ups

can happen to you.

You can get all alone

and know not what to do.

You might even wonder once:

'Doctor who?'

&gt; It also shows a monthly default repayment amount - this is how much you would be liable to repay each month if you did not inform us of your actual income while overseas.

It's basically the same as the UK - the only difference being the threshold at which that begins to apply. 

The flat rate **only** applies when you **haven't** told them that you're going to work abroad. The flat rate is set and isn't based on any percentage.

I'm guessing in your case, if they're chasing you up then you may have a couple of flat payments to pay outright, and everything after you've declared the relevant information should go back to the normal system of 9% over the threshold.

Regional tax breaks, enterprise zones, improvement of infrastructure, regional projects, cheap business startup loans. You make it sound like Government and Economy are walled off from one another, but there is plenty that the Government could do to promote regional wealth.

Yes, but borrowing money for projects that will return more money is not a bad thing. The problem the UK has is structural deficit - i.e. the UK government has to borrow rather a lot of money just to go about its business.

Who complains about Cosmopolitan not catering to boys on their front page? Who complains about Page 3 not having male models or Gilette not having a genderless polyamorous genderqueer pseudo-dyke genderfluid person on the packaging?

No one, because the overwhelming majority of Cosmo buyers are females and the overwhelming majority of Gilette buyers are men, so they reflect that in the packaging. They should be able to sell their own product however they want to.

For example, there's a long-standing stereotype that women don't like hard sciences.  The ""evidence"" for this is that hard science subjects are mostly taken by boys, while girls are more likely to take soft sciences or arts.

But this isn't a simple case of cause and effect where the result demonstrates that the stereotype is accurate.  Rather, evidence from people trying to increase the number of girls and women in hard science is that girls are discouraged from doing so starting at a young age, and continuing through school, where teachers often assume that girls won't be interested in science, and therefore don't encourage them. 

Conversely, people assume that things like raising children and cooking are women's interests, and men who show an interest in them can incur a large amount of ire and mocking for violating their assigned gender role.  I'm fairly sure that there is t least one boy (and probably many more than one) who would be interested in playing with a barbie or another ""girls"" toy, but either doesn't, or is made to feel bad and wrong for doing so, because it's not ""manly"" enough. 

This sort of enforced gender role doesn't, on most instances, come from people consciously deliberately enforcing gender stereotypes. Rather, it's a subtle process, that begins from birth, whereby children learn what's expected of their gender role. 

OP's post is an example of a particularly obvious sort of stereotyping that we are (very slowly) managing to get rid of, but even seemingly harmless comments like ""only girls play with barbie"" enforce gender roles just as much.

A few weeks back, after the last runners in the London Marathon had passed by out stakeout, I was lying in Greenwich park with some friends.

It must have been 10 metres at least in length ad it just kept going up. I think I've got a pic of it at home. It looked like it would be a huge hazard for planes.

We couldn't figure out how it could happen, then a few minutes later a mini tornado/whirlwind whipped through the park and picked up everyones plastic bags and rubbish and carried them straight up into the air. I watched it cross the park and pick up all sorts of rubbish, was really incredible. I figure the same whirlwind had attacked the mile marker.

&gt;Hormones, Social Behavior, and Cognitive Skills
Biological factors that are thought to shape gender differences include hormones and lateralization of brain function. Hormones may organize a biological predisposition to be masculine or feminine during the prenatal period, and the increase in hormones during puberty may activate that predisposition. In addition, social experiences may alter the levels of hormones, such as testosterone.

true,uberyeti,eng-Suffolk,Big ole traactur!,"Yes, they are game changers. The point of strategic nuclear warfare is not to destroy the enemy army, but to hold a gun to the head of the enemy's civilian population and make starting a war national suicide.

They are there now as a threat to prevent attack, not to assist with it.

That said, tactical nuclear weapons were tested and deployed by the USA and USSR during the '50s through to at least the '70s. These were much smaller bombs than those targeted against cities during the Cold War, and were designed to destroy enemy airbases, missile sites, aircraft carrier battlegroups, and submarines quickly and completely before they got a chance to attack.

The Cold War saw the construction of nuclear torpedoes, nuclear depth charges, nuclear land mines, nuclear artillery, nuclear mortars, and probably more that weren't declassified. These kind of weapons were all designed to be used against specific military targets. When one missile launched by a fighter jet can destroy an entire fleet of ships or an entire airbase instantly, these would completely change the way battle was fought. 

Though the reason the UK keeps nuclear weapons (Trident) is only to retaliate if anyone ever attacked us or NATO with nuclear weapons.

true,narthgir,null,null,"I think, like so many of these cases which just sound terrible, that the answer is... complain more, and more effectively. There is an art to complaining effectively, and if I read your post there are at least 3 major points you should be complaining on 1. The loan company not paying, 2. The council not helping because you ""technically"" made yourselves homeless and 3. The MP not replying.

So the main one is the Student Loan company. If you have documentation from them, a contract which would have been signed, check the terms. I would be really surprised if they haven't breached their own terms. When you call, you need the supervisor. The person who answers the phone can do nothing for you, you ask them for their manager &amp; threaten a complaint (generally call centres don't want complaints as it hurts their stats).

Next up is your council, I wouldn't pursue this much, but that answer can't be acceptable. I would be inclined to contact them and ask to enter their complaints process. It probably won't achieve much, but it's better than nothing.

As far as I know, if you can prove you live in an area, your MP cannot refuse to communicate with you. Go see them in person in their constituency office - if they continue to ignore you, first threaten to report them to the media, and if the still ignore you, do report them.

The most important thing is stay calm, keep your voice calm, but refuse to take no for an answer. Ask for managers, ask for names from everyone, and then the last part if try and use their human nature - not always possible, but if you establish a rapport with someone, they might be more inclined to help you. Complaining effectively is a skill, and requires bundles of patience, but also an ability to stay strong and enter into confrontation. (e.g. with the loans company, whatever excuse they come up with, just say ""I don't want to hear your excuses. I am about to be made homeless and want to know what you are doing to send me my money today"".

Falcao is unnecessary if we keep Lukaku at the club for next season. Lukaku, Torres and Ba fighting for a single starting spot is good enough. I'd rather keep the money than buy another striker and, again, we definitely don't need another one if Schurrle signs since he can play there too.

Do we need a CB? Yes. Should we get Pepe? Absolutely not. He has a terrible attitude, is getting old, and isn't that amazing. There are other options out there. I hear good things about Vlad Chiriches and he's been linked.

If you're a boy who likes things associated as ""boyish"" then fine. Same if you're a girl who likes ""girly"" things. But neither should be restricted from the things they like just because of outdated stereotypes.

true,mejogid,cnty-uk,London,"&gt; - national debt is how much we owe
- deficit is how much more we owe each period (year or month). Unqualified deficit probably means 'per year'.

This is correct.

&gt; So if national debt is £1000 and yearly deficient is £100, we'll owe £1100 next year.

Not quite - if we say that all government debt is in the form of 10 year bonds, and the deficit has always been £100, then we'll have finished paying off £100 from 10 years ago - thus knocking it back down to £1,000. In that situation, we could run a £100 deficit every year and stay at £1,000 deficit perpetually.

&gt; ""Reducing the deficit by 25%"" means we're only borrowing £75/year instead of £100/year. So the debt still grows.

Taking the scenario above, it would actually shrink to £975.

&gt; Reducing deficit by 100% would mean we're not borrowing any more, but we still have a debt to pay off (and pay interest on etc) and we're making no progress on that.

Again, in the scenario above the debt would be going down by £100 every year. Actually slightly more than that, because as the debt goes down we'll no longer be paying interest payments on it (these are hidden within the overall budget, so essentially overall government expenditure decreases)

This is why, if you look at a [graph like this](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/budget/9932748/Budget-2013-Britains-debt-and-deficit.html) it's possible for the debt to decrease while we still have a deficit.",0,1367425458,null,0,false,0,c9qd7wb,t3_1dha2a,t1_c9qd7wb,t1_c9qd196,null,1431360502,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

To break down your question:

**why would I use this rather than someone with a high rating and OTC on localbitcoins**

We only launched 2 weeks ago, so have yet to build up a high rating.  We hope that over the next few weeks, as people use our service, they will recommend us to others and vouch for us as an honest service.  We have a support thread at bitcointalk and I encourage people to leave feedback.  The catch 22 is that someone has to take the plunge and risk buying from us, and this is one of the reasons why we are initially limiting orders to 1BTC to encourage people to make smaller purchases to build confidence in the site.  In addition to the above, although it is not mentioned on the site, we are happy to use an escrow for sales at this stage.

The advantage of buying from us over OTC or localbitcoins is that you only have to trust one seller.  Obviously we need to build this trust, but we are confident that we can do so.  A dishonest seller on OTC could build up a rating doing small trades, scam someone on a larger trade and start all over again.  We cant exactly just relaunch the site (I think someone would notice), so any dishonest move on our part would completely destroy us.  Essentially, we have much more to loose.


**The difference in price is significant. Are you buying from LBC and reselling at a little profit, essentially selling the service of taking the risk**

We buy direct from the exchanges (which one depends on the market).  I would argue that the difference in price is not significant.  Currently, we are 2.5% above BitBargain and pretty much on par with localbitcoin.  Last night our price was actually lower than both sites.  Our price is based on a flat percentage above the market rate, with an additional percentage based on market volatility.  If the market is very volatile, our margin is higher to reduce the amount of risk on our side.

**But then what's to say you won't just keep the money if your deal falls through. The lack of feedback is of concern.**

I hopefully answered this in my first response.  If buyers are hesitant, I encourage them to request an escrow, or purchase in small amounts.  I would also ask buyers to leave feedback either here or on bitcointalk.

Thanks

No just the Daily Mail reading, racist, middle aged men - of any colour (who consequently aren't a race).

DONT: Insult others. Insults do not contribute to a rational discussion. 

DONT: Downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it. 

DONT: Make comments that lack content.

&gt; Oh right, you were talking about all those non-white people in small towns weren't you?

But I respect your right to defend Daily Mail readers even if that's where your coming from.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"From what I've seen of both of the #9s we've been linked with, Benteke is the slightly better option but at this point he might be too expensive.

Damiao is a significantly better finisher IMO but he has some pretty big holes in his overall game. Benteke is better with his back to goal and better at playing little combinations and flicks to his teammates. Damiao is a better dribbler and more likely to take a player on score some spontaneously genius goal.

Personally I wish we could have a player in the vein of Lewandowski. Obviously someone in that tier of players isn't realistic for us, but I think Benteke has a higher chance of becoming that sort of player than Damiao. Benteke already has great vision and passing at 22. He makes 1.5 chances for his teammates per game and still has managed 18 goals in the PL, all without being the most clinical of players. He also uses his body a lot better than Damiao, whose frame is kind of deceiving. 

To me at all still depends on the price. If Damiao is closer to 15m than 20m I'd be all over him as well because while I think he's flawed his finishing alone would be a massive improvement on either of our strikers.

Of course someone can make an argument that Leandro has a higher ceiling than Benteke because he's more technically gifted and a better and more natural finisher. Perhaps it can be claimed that it's easier to teach a player how to play with back to goal and pick out teammates than it is to finish. Damiao would be more of a project IMO but the ceiling is pretty high. 

Tough call, I'd take either of them depending on the realism and the price.",0,1367428658,null,0,false,0,c9qef6m,t3_1dgxg1,t1_c9qef6m,t3_1dgxg1,null,1431359936,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4

I think that they meant 18% of tax revenue went on interest. As tax is slightly more than a third of GDP it is believable that 18% of tax revenue goes on interest.

You're right, though much of the public are confused in the opposite direction, they think that because the deficit is shrinking that the debt is shrinking.

The evidence is very uncertain, that is all that can be said about this. There is some evidence that the Bush tax cuts did raise revenue, though this could have been due to a Keynesian stimulus from the deficit rather than dynamic effects.

IMO taxing earnings is far more moral than wealth though.

These children will ultimately grow up to be adult men and women... and as utopian as it might seem to LGBT organisations to avoid such specific gender identity, the fact remains that is what the world will expect of them as adults. Boys will be expected to compartmentalise their fears, avoid seeking help and compete aggressively with other men (and women) for the best jobs and partners. Women will be expected to dress and act attractively, adopt caring roles and raise children. Obviously these are generalisations **not limitations** and there is no reason why anyone in our modern society 'must' do these things... but perhaps they are more the uncomfortable reality of the fact men and women aren't the same, and our simple biology exerts different pressures on them both.

So as mind-warping as it may seem, playing with that toy soldier or the barbie doll is actually doing some pretty early ground work to prepare that child for the kind of world in which they will have to carve out a niche for themselves.

The danger is, in an effort to be inclusive of girls (which is ultimately what this is driving for), that we actually alienate boys from areas they traditionally occupied.

Looking at their strategy these days I don't see any great change. The gist of that soundbite is that on any given issue SF should adopt whatever policy their 'enemies' us Brits don't agree with.

I remember seeing Sandro covering for Parker last season, and you could hear Redknapp shouting at Sandro to stay back when he had opportunities to run forward with the ball. This did allow our attaching players to concentrate more on attacking....
Things are a little different under AVB's system because he prefers to have ""all-rounder"" types in the middle of the park where the defensive mid has more chances to go forward when the opportunity presents itself. Sandro (and possibly Huddlestone) is better at being a box to box defensive mid. 
Parker was out for a long time with injury, and at his age it takes a while to get back to full flow. I'm surprised he hasn't scored for us yet, and I do think he has a decent shot on him, but I rarely want him to do anything else attack minded. He certainly seems to hold onto the ball a little too long when he's dribbling recently. But I think this is a case of him selflessly (funnily enough)trying to suck the defender in before he releases the ball over to one of our attackers who will then have more space. 
In our game against Wigan, it felt a bit awkward to have Thudd closest to our defenders while Parker was in the final 3rd, trying to find space. However, I do like the idea of starting Parker and Sandro together when we go up against the big dogs away from home.

true,DavidNatan,eu,Sweden,"I don't buy it. What sells is simply what sells. It has nothing to do with what's people's perception of 'suitable' otherwise religious organizations would rule the economy. 

It's what people buy when they can't choose anything for a gift, which boosts sales immensely. They think boy/girl and buy a girly/boy-ish thing, and the items that fulfill the stereotype succeed. The beauty of it is exactly that it can't be both some deep dark conspiracy and the economically most viable solution. It's either a conspiracy meant to keep women down, or it's the best strategy companies can take for the times we live in. 

Or at least up until very recently when it's becoming more profitable to posture as non-gender-specific to appeal to more liberal people.

Now what effect that has on women's lifestyle choices is another thing. I personally believe that people don't make lifestyle choices per say based on coincidental stuff like what kind of toys they were given. They make 'go with the flow' choices based on stuff like that. If something is important to you you'll pursue it no matter what.

Women should have the freedom to choose any profession and be treated equally, everywhere, but I don't think if they don't choose STEM nearly as much as men, even in countries like Sweden and Norway, that's a bad sign. 

Honestly I want to throw out the information about statistical distribution of men and women in STEM vs non-STEM areas away and never look at it again. To me it's the most over-hyped inconsequential to anyone's life, worth, or self-esteem piece of random data.

The construction got me interested in physical and spacial problems, and just generally fixing things. The cars got me interested automotives, and eventually motorsports. I had dinosaurs which I would bash around (my love of palaeontology and geology), Airfix models (mostly rockets that got me interested in space), and loads of other toys which always seemed aimed at boys.

* words ending in ""l"" becoming a ""w"" like sound (hard to write down) or in the middle ""old"" becomes ""owd"".
* glottal stops
* non-rhoticity (not pronouncing the ""r"" e.g. ""butter"" being ""butta"" - which from above would further become ""bu'a"" the ' being a glottal stop).
* dropping the ""h"" and then stressing it on the name of the letter...
* tag questions on the end of statements like ""it is green, ain't it?"" or ""it's green, innit"".
* ""Yod-coalescence"" saying ""tuna"" as ""chuna"" or ""tube"" and ""choob""
* double-negation ""I ain't done nothing"" 
* this one seems to be only South Essex but saying ""pillow"" as ""pillah"", or ""window"" as ""windah"" and ""out"" as ""aat"" and ""about"" as ""abaat"". Most likely to do with Londoners moving into Essex. Most common example ""Sand as a pand""


These ones seem limited to North Essex that borders Suffolk (Colchester and Tendring boroughs mainly):

* some vowels are shortened like ""been"" is a homophone to ""bin"" and ""seen"" with ""sin""
* non-standard words like ""shew"" for ""showed"", ""brung"" for ""brought"", ""snew"" for ""snowed"", ""driv"" for ""drove"".
* the ""y"" sound in words like music or dew becomes moosic and doo

I don't know any else on top of my head.

Obviously I don't want to sound like a dinosaur - and to my mind the balance in all this is finding a place where boys/girls, men/women can accept their inherant differences - but reasonably equal opportunities are afforded to both. So to my mind, **the solution isn't stripping children of a gender that they will ultimately posses - but rather teaching them it is okay to play with the toys from the boys section if they want, because in the grand scheme of things it isn't really that important**... but never the less, they are a girl/boy and with that go certain inevitable truths.

From there, a valid and semi-popular opinion is now bandwagoned and sent spiralling into the negatives. Whoops! With the comment hiding the initial votes don't get to decide the future of a comment and the actual quality of the comment is judged.

true,Audioworm,cnty-expat,Paris (Expat),"This is just my opinion but the goal lies in two fronts. Firstly to reduce the societal roles placed on each gender, and to allow people to be more fluid with their choices.

The word patriarchy is thrown around a lot, and people often use it as a buzzword to enforce a point rather than analysing what it actually means or presents. Most of expectations of genders relate to an overhanging concept that the historical patriarchy has set. Men are expect to be the strong, brave ones, who don't let themselves be effected by emotions. Women are expected to be the nurturing, caring ones, whose power often derives from their ability to marry into stability and protection.

But neither of these positions are fair to either gender. We are well aware that being emotionally secretive is not a good idea, and being able to communicate and discuss problems and 'feelings' is a much healthier way of dealing with them. This emotional lock and key that my gender is meant to have is possibly a reason for the higher suicide rate of men, compared to women. The expectation of men to be the breadwinners also puts stresses on them that can lead to feelings of failure to 'be a man' which may explain the rise in the disparity during the current recession.

Women being expected to be the caring, motherly ones limits their ability to do whatever it is they want, and to fully self-actualise. You notice it across various parts of society and the behaviour towards women. An obvious one is the attitude towards middle-aged 'never married' individuals. Men can pull off the bachelor, occupied by career, etc. while for women there is an air of 'how come she isn't married' or 'she has a biological clock ticking away' (yes, there is a biological precedent for having children at a certain time, but why is having offspring expected). I was also informed by some of my friends that career advice was given to them with the expectation of them having children. You could argue that this is necessary due to the obvious differences, but the expectation always lay on the woman taking the time off work.

Women are currently expected to be the pretty object trying to catch the attention of a man, who is then to woo her. It is a dynamic that a lot of people accept as just a part of society. Even proposals are meant to be done by the men, so much so that the leap day is considered the day when women are supposed to do the proposing. It is, when looked back at it, a totally unnecessary dichotomy, that adds nothing to society.

When you start to raise a generation that doesn't have the same walls or barriers, or is taught not to think with those expectations you have a horizontal cross section of society that doesn't have those expectations. A whole swathe that doesn't respond as desired to by marketers and media. This makes the power of these expectations less so.

No one is saying the idea of gender is going to disappear. Their are still going to be cis/trans*/other-gendered, hetero/homo/a/bi-sexual and hetero/homo/a/bi-romatic people. There are still going to be women who really want to raise a family, and men who still want to fix cars. But there are going to be men who want to raise kids given the legal and societal ability to do so, and women who can pursue their interests in fields that are nearly complete male dominated.

The idea isn't about destroying genders, but about removing the expectations of genders to behave a certain way. Imagining a world with these reductions is often difficult to follow mentally because so much of our society is built upon these roles, but society will carry on fine without them. The benefits far outweigh the downsides because by opening more roles and options, the current options still remain.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"Thanks for the thought out reply. A few thoughts;

&gt; The expectation of men to be the breadwinners also puts stresses on them
&gt; Women are currently expected to be the pretty object trying to catch the attention of a man

I think this often gets attributed to archaic societal roles... but I suspect it is actually a much more intrinsic, biological and behavioural trait that will not disappear. As I alluded to above, men and women exert behavioural pressures on each other... In studies that look at what women value in a partner, they frequently rank occupation/good financial status highly. Men rarely rate this as a 'deal breaking' characteristic - and are more likely to favour physical beauty (whilst women rarely rate this as a deal breaker). Essentially, the reason men go out and earn bread is not because it is their traditional role... but rather because it is central to finding a mate. No job = poor relationship prospects. i.e. you gotta get paid to get laid.

You could argue that maybe these 'desirable partner traits' will change with changing opinions... but that doesn't seem to be the case based on what research has been done in this field. Even women in comfortably paid career position still value a partner with a solid occupation. It is as much an evolutionary feature that men favour physical characteristics more, compared relatively with women. I really don't think it will change all that much.

&gt; The idea isn't about destroying genders, but about removing the expectations of genders to behave a certain way

I certainly agree 100% with the first part. But I think people might be optimistic about how much they will really affect change over the second part. I certainly think a lot of our current generations behaviours are to an extent, a result of nuturing that way... but I do think it runs deeper than that to. Men don't **act** less emotionally aware than women... they **are** less emotionally aware (as studies have shown). Men don't **act** more competitively than women... they **are** more competitive (as research has shown).


At any rate, my fear with all this is that it is cheating children out of the realities of the world they will grow up in. It potentially puts these boys/girls in a position where as adult men/women, they will be ill equipt to deal with the pressures put on them - both by themselves biologically, and by each other.",0,1367439948,null,0,false,0,c9qizck,t3_1dh3g4,t1_c9qizck,t1_c9qi979,null,1431357715,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

Generally, it's hard to agree with all policies under a certain domain, but there are some really good ideas mixed in there with some very scary ideas.

I know this is just a manifesto and like every manifesto ever they'll probably rewrite it if they came to power, but here are some of my personal favourites/nightmares:

&gt; Flat 31% tax on all earnings above £11,500.

I believe that simplifying the tax system will lower avoidance by reducing the need for it, and empower people to take control of their own finances and understand what's happening with their income.



&gt; £3.5bn spent on nuclear with a view to having 50% nuclear in the national energy mix.

I'm of the view that nuclear is high density, high output output and relatively clean. We're geographically based in a safe location, surrounded by water, to run these power plants.



&gt; Council tax abolished (though the workaround sounds a bit precarious.)

This should be incorporated in to income tax or similar, surely?



&gt; Five-year freeze on immigration for permanent settlement followed by 50,000 annual cap.

We're running out of space. Allowing 50,000 highly skilled workers in a year sounds like a cheaper option than stopping the need for immigration by improving education, although I'm somewhat worried they've not mentioned education at all in that article.



&gt; Create voucher system to allow people to opt out of NHS system entirely.

If for whatever reason you'd rather receive all your healthcare privately then so be it. I also accept that this would probably bring that person's income tax down as well.



&gt; Child benefit for the first three children only.

If you can't support your first three children without state help, should you really be having more children?



&gt; No benefits for anyone who has not lived in the UK for five years.

This will simplify benefits mean testing and put an end to the problem of people thinking this country is an instant benefit haven.



&gt; Support coal-fired power and oppose wind farms.

Provided that carbon capturing technologies are also developed and incentivised, I see this as a more dense and higher output method of energy generation. It doesn't ruin the countryside and it offers a reliable energy source, unlike wind which is variable, and thus less efficient.



&gt; Incentivise the production of electric cars.

I would love to see more startups like Tesla in this country.

**There are some that I really don't get good feelings about:**



&gt; Cut state spending to 1997 levels with loss of two million public sector jobs, replaced by one million new manufacturing jobs and at least another million created because of Ukip's lower tax environment.

I don't think half of all public sector workers can instantly be retrained in to a manufacturing profession. Yes, spending should be cut, but it would need to be a steady change with training opportunities.



&gt; Work permits to be time-limited and overstaying made a crime. No amnesty for illegal immigrants: all returned to home country.

Sounds to me like another crime the police won't have time to deal with, unless these immigrants are criminals. Where would these people go if they were arrested or otherwise apprehended?



&gt; End active promotion of the doctrine of multiculturalism.

What is the ""doctrine of multiculturalism"" exactly? I take it as a way of society that includes everyone and actively tries to integrate everyone in to a community, regardless of race or creed. If anything, we need to promote this more and get everyone integrated.



&gt; Deport dangerous imams, terror suspects and wanted criminals more easily by scrapping the Human Rights Act.

Sounds a bit OTT to me!



&gt; Increase spending by 40%, double the size of the Territorial Army and increase total armed forces numbers by 25%.

For what war exactly? Wouldn't we be better off boosting the education budget by 40%?



&gt; Smoking rooms in pubs.

I'd rather see less cancerous ways of getting high on nicotine get developed than make everyone else in a pub get cancer.



&gt; Ban schools from showing Al Gore's film, An Inconvenient Truth.**

Huh? You go to a restaurant and like the food, you keep going, whoever the chef is gets ""promoted"". I've never been to a restaurant and known who exactly cooked the food (a few pubs though).

It's only when the chefs get to the top of their profession that they're known enough to attract people for their name and image. So it seems in the restaurant world that assuming you're as likely to be employed as a man or woman (given the same abilities, eg strong enough to carry sacks of potatoes) in the lowest roles that it's pretty fair.

I get stupidly excited over costuming and had to research as much ready made stuff as possible as we were trying to put together his 10 costume for the Expo while he was deployed. I think I've found every place that makes the outfits, it's just a question of quality for the asking price.

Just realized the same eBay seller does an INCREDIBLY cheap version of the suit; for the money it looks pretty good, just seems to be more white stripe on brown than pale blue stripe on brown.

http://www.ebay.ca/itm/Doctor-Dr-Brown-Pinstripe-Suit-Blazer-Pants-Custom-Made-/151031634430?pt=US_Costumes&amp;hash=item232a2fd9fe#ht_6884wt_1117

I already flat out refused to do the jacket for husband, told him to buy it as fabric alone would cost the same or more and they have it screen accurate. The pleats and seams are as close as possible going by all my reference material, so as far as I'm concerned after seeing it on the guy at the Expo it's 100% worth the money. It was weird, but I totally molested his jacket after we took those photos (I'm the TARDIS ballgown, husband is cowboy!Eleven) and was actually quite impressed with it.

Suit though.. that's a tough call. It's a tricky one having that made for you just from measurements without fittings, as it may still need some alterations in the end. If you go for it, measure multiple times for accuracy. I did my husband's 11 blazer based on his measurements while he was away visiting family and it fit perfectly. I also haven't seen their suit in person, just the jacket.. but if the suit is made with the same level of quality and detail as their jacket was, then why not? It's the best deal I've seen, even Baron's suits are still almost $400.

Seriously if you want to put this costume together and need any help or advice just send me a message, I absolutely love stuff like this. :)",0,1367442881,null,0,false,0,c9qk4sr,t3_1dh4qe,t1_c9qk4sr,t1_c9qjukt,null,1431357173,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

true,tfw13579,flair8,,"I disagree. I love Scott Parker when he's playing as a defensive mid, but he is not a box to box mid and as a result, has been playing terrible these past few months. He works so hard that he ends up going forward and trying to be a playmaker when he simply is not. A lot of the time this results in him playing a bad pass, dribbling to a corner, or playing it to a teammate who has no outlet. This has even led to Dembele having to cover for Parker at times, preventing him from going forward when he is 100x better at Parker at that.

I think that a 4-3-3 with Hudd as the anchor man a much better fit for the team then any team with Parker in it. Sure, Hudd isn't mobile enough to play as sole cover of the defense but with Holtby and Dembele alongside him, we have 3 solid mids that are willing to play defense, work hard, and can all pass. Dembele and Holtby will make up for any mobility issues that Hudd has and let him cellect the ball and ping it around the pitch while also allowing Dembele or Holtby to move forward.

Its sad but I don't see any way that Parker would fit into an AVB side. He has shown that he just doesn't fit over the past two months and unless he is ok with a backup role (he would be an amazing back up or super sub to solidify a lead), I almost hope that he moves on.

The ban on handguns initially came in in 1997 under the John Major Conservative government. This allowed .22 rimfire pistols to be owned. Later in 1997, Tony Blair's Labour government were elected and quickly banned those as well.

Also, strictly speaking, handguns aren't banned by name. The ban simply applies to any firearm with a barrel less than 30cm. It is technically legal to own a handgun with an absurdly long barrel, if you have a firearms certificate for it.

The back four is the back four, although presumably the attacking load is lifted from the fullbacks since we'd have wingers?  Or would the wingers make room for advancing fullbacks?  Is Kolarov completely surplus in this formation?  Do the full backs sit around the midfield during the attacking phase and help to retain possession?

Of the midfield three I presume you want a deep-lying playmaker (like a Modric) but what should the other two be?  Where is the link between midfield and attack?  Is that Yaya pushing forwards or would we expect Aguero to collect the ball deeper?  Would Nasri make a good deep-lying playmaker?  Do we need a second box-to-box player alongside Yaya?

If the team is set up right, it also allows you to get all of you're best players on the field at a time, or supplant them with others when you need to spare them. it  can be as defensive or offensive as you like, is thin or as wide as you like. You can focus on possession, or pressing, or counterattacking, or you can hole up in the box and defend like a motherfucker. There is bascally no end to the options.

&gt;
&gt;Lennon - Defoe - Bale

    **Some notes:** 
    - Huddlestone has tremendous vision, but needs someone to compensate for his lack of mobility (AKA Holtby). 
      I love siggy, but he doesn't fill that gap.

&gt;
&gt;Lennon - Defoe - Bale

    **Some notes:**
    - I think Siggy is more talented than Holtby, and has better vision. Just my opinion, I think it would 
      serve Bale and Defoe better. Huddlestone/Holtby and Sandro/Siggy combos would do well. 
      The former combo for when we're down late in the game.
    - We NEED DAWSON on the field. Our defense just doesn't operate well without him.

&gt;
&gt;Bale - Damiao? - Lennon

    **Some notes:**  
    - Same thing as before, Siggy/Sandro for starts, Holtby/Huddlestone when we want to take some chances late in the game and don't mind leaving some open space.
    - I think Bale on RW and Lennon on LW would be better, unless Damiao is really good at headers.
    - Starting defense above, but use Dawson and Caulker frequently (possibly even always have one on. 
      They provide the ariel prowess that Vert and maybe Kaboul don't (although I admit I don't know how good
      Kaboul is in the air)). Hopefully AVB can work on their cohesion this summer so that they can be 
      organized without Dawson in there commanding them.
    - Carroll needs to find a place in this in the midfield, but I don't know what his actual best position is...

----------------------
Other notes:

* I think we should try Walker at CDM once or twice and put Naughton on the right back. Call my crazy but I think he'd be good at it.
* Lockout formation of Walker-Dawson/Caulker-Kaboul-Vertonghen and CDM of Sandro and Huddlestone.
* I think Vertonghen should play left back if we don't sign another one this summer. He's better suited at covering wingers imo, especially with his precision slide tackling ability. Also allows him to go up the field more without risking leaving as much open space behind him.
* Speaking of trying defenders elsewhere, I also think we should try Naughton at RW. Kid's got a nice shot.
* Single most important thing AVB needs to work on this summer is finding a leader in the midfield. I'm talking someone that will make sure as fuck that those gaps in the midfield don't open up for the other team to come down on us in the breakaway. That's our largest hole in my opinion. Our defense needs work too, but they can't do much when they're outnumbered or the other team gets a ton of space in the middle of our half.

If anything, he's yet another threatening player in the final third that can give teams problems when they're already dealing with the likes of Bale, Dembele, Siggy, Lennon, 1st half Jan, Dempsey, and Ade/Defoe. Great depth player at a great price, great age, great spirit.

One qualm I have with him that seems to come up time and time again though is how deep he'll come to get the ball at times. It feels like he's trying to send a message to other players to be more available and to give better passing options.

Another good way to revise them is to come up with 2 points for each piece to do with some headings, eg. Melody, structure, harmony, rythym, dynamics etc. This'll help with the essay because the essay is 10 marks and you will get 5 headings, so 2 points about each will get you full marks.

If you struggle with theory then just look at the theory in context, eg. Cadences, mozart uses lots of perfect cadences (classical idea) the Handel has a plagual at the end ( 
common in religious works). The theory becomes easier as you look at how it works as a whole. (Also go checkout /r/musictheory they'll help you!)

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"Dempsey gets criticized because he's 30 years old and can't receive the ball without falling over in half of his appearances. He is too cumbersome both mentally and physically to play little combinations and when he's not in the mood he spends more time whining for free kicks and trying to buy fouls than contributing. 

Holtby is highly rated not only because of his energy but because of his vision, fast-thinking, and technique. He has an incisive passing ability that no one else currently at the club comes close to. For some perspective, Dempsey has attempted 7 through balls in 25 appearances. Holtby has attempted 5 in 9.

Some of the passes he played coming off the bench against City were fantastic and helped us win the match. I specifically remember one where he picked out BAE between the lines which was a breath of fresh air from our normal routine of playing into feet constantly.

Furthermore he's a player who always seems to know what he's going to do with the ball before he receives it. Dempsey is frustrating because he looks completely bereft of ideas most of the time he receives the ball. He has the occasional moment of brilliance (playing Walker in against City) but most of the time he either shoots immediately or falls down. In a lot of appearances, Dempsey looks like a player who has finished a marathon right before kickoff; he's sluggish from the start. 

Finally, Lewis is 22 years old and has only been at the club for half a season so I think people are right to at least let him have a full preseason under his belt. He showed what he's capable of against Norwich where he turned the game around singlehandedly. The guy is younger than Sigurdsson and barely older than Tom fucking Carroll. 

I'm not saying Dempsey hasn't had a role to play this year. Scoring goals is important and he does that, but he's not going to get any better or change his play style at 30 years old.

Cutting tax and raising spending are the hallmarks of a good (also bullshit) party manifesto.

true,Sparklesnap,flair4,,"I don't see that 110% from Parker anymore.. too often i've seen him standing around in space on the defensive end.

The bigger problem for my part with Parker is offensively; look at what Huddlestone brings to the table; he does a good job of staying back near the midline, breaking up play as it comes out of the opposition half and re-starting our attack.

Parker, on the other hand, goes charging ahead into the opposition half, leaving our back four badly exposed, and forcing us to play an end-to-end game that we're neither equipped nor prepared to play. It was fine under Harry, when we wanted to sit deep with our back line and play on the break; having that space between defense and attack worked well, because it played into our hands to play end-to-end football.

But under AVB where we try to condense the field and play as a cohesive unit, his lack of positional discipline on both ends of the field is more of a liability than his effort.

Also, for such a ""veteran"" player, he makes an astonishing number of bone-headed mistakes; trying tough passes when he's far up the pitch, throwing himself into tackles 45 yards from goal when we need to play positional defense and win the ball back; the Penalty he gave up against West Ham is the perfect example of Scotty throwing himself blindly at a tackle when simply stepping in front of the player would've done just as well defensively.

I'm not saying Scotty is a poor player; I love scotty, I really do, but i'm not sure how much he has in the tank right now (remember, he was just starting his way into match-fitness when Sandro went down) and he's also 32; no spring Chicken.

true,phadrox,english,Edinburgh,"&gt;""The coalition boasts it has cut the annual deficit by 25%, yet any school boy with a calculator can work out to reduce national debt the reduction needs to be 125% otherwise it continues to grow."" - this is confusing and hilarious. A 100% reduction would balance the books, and lead to no debt in the long run. Significantly less than a 100% reduction in deficit would still see a reduction in debt (so long as it was lower than the historic deficit average).

I think you have confused the overall debt with the deficit here.  I'm not saying I agree with any of their policies, but they are correct that the *annual* deficit will have to reduce by over 100% in order to reduce total debt.  This is the only way that the interest payments can be finally drawn down, outside of negotiating better rates, and that seems unlikely given our weak growth.  If the deficit decreases by less than 100%, then the overall amount we have borrowed increases slightly, and hence our annual interest payments go up.

true,Audioworm,cnty-expat,Paris (Expat),"On the first point, differentiating what is nurture and what is nature can be extremely difficult when engrained so deeply in a psyche (I am aware of this on myself after taking part in a study where I learnt that I was subconsciously assigning lower IQs to non-STEM students despite spend most of my free time at high level debates with mostly humanities students). I will concede that studies show such desirable traits, and they can be attributed to evolutionary psychology in places. But firstly we shouldn't have to be defined by pure or raw evolutionary traits, and secondly when the rigidity of the roles and duties of genders diminish we will probably notice the emergence of a new steady state. 

Where this state will end up is hard to predict, but what people find attractive is probably unlikely to drastically change but will possibly become more nuanced or subtle than it currently is.

To try and assemble this into something more together (and I shouldn't try and write things like this after minimal sleep and long days), when the behaviour of each gender fall away from the current standards by some amount, the expectation for them to act that way will become diminished. Looking at the way people dating has changed over the last 20/50/100 years shows hints at the way gender expectations have moved along in certain way.

On the second part, among inherent differences in behaviour, there is also a discouragement to act in the way outside your expected roles. Men are mocked or looked down upon for being emotional outside a few choice moments, women are often not encouraged to be assertive or aggressive when needed (considered bitches or such forth). 

There is obviously a difference between men and women when it comes to physiology, but there are many who act, or wish to, outside the confinement. They are many who could achieve greater, more satisfying, or simply different, things if allowed to follow what calls them.

And when comes to the emotional side of things, for the most part he does the complete opposite of exaggeration.  There's an incredible subtlety to his performance- he doesn't scream and shout and cry (or when he does, he does it in very small doses).

To the museum on Stour Street (with resident's permit again), see Bagpuss &amp; the mice, and many other 60s and 70s TV favourites. There's a lot of Rupert stuff, but I do not care for the bear.

See what's on display in the Sidney Cooper Gallery, and the temporary exhibition spaces at the library.

Have a couple of pints in a pub - there are far too many to list here, but I'm fond of the Cherry Tree or the Blind Dog, which has a very friendly dog (Caesar) who is not blind.

Get the makings of a picnic in a supermarket and sit in Greyfriars garden by the river, or if it's too full go further down the river out of the city.

In the afternoon walk or get the bus up Whitstable Road to the University and take the footpath back down the hill into town.

See buskers on St Peter's Street/High street, another drink outside a pub - perhaps one in the main street such as The Cricketers.

Fish and chips from many outlets - I really like the one in Northgate opposite the Jolly Sailor, and I dislike the one in St Margaret's Street. By the river near the Miller's Arms is a nice place to sit.

In all seriousness, uberyeti's analysis is excellent. In my opinion, the scariest time for the Cold War to have potentially turned into a real shooting war was the fifties or sixties - because in the later years, it was realised just what a powerful, last-resort force was being handled, set quite apart from conventional warfare methods; but in those early post-WWII days, military strategists on both sides assumed that they were just another tool in the conventional warfare toolbox, and put small nuclear weaponry into all kinds of little projects like this for troops on the ground to fire at one another.

The really scary thing is tactical weaponry like Davy Crockett bombs had very, *very* basic locks - often all you needed to detonate a warhead like that was a three-digit combination code. So troops on the ground, cut off from command, might panic and use them to repel the enemy when backed into a corner - the enemy responds with a slightly larger airstrike - the original force responds to that with larger bombs still over the offending airbases - retaliatory missiles start to be launched at enemy targets further and further away, and pretty soon, you have a full-scale nuclear exchange. It's not hard to imagine Europe, racked with tension yet again in the Berlin Crisis in 1961 [as the wall was built, and the Soviets demanded that the Western armies leave the city, which they point-blank refused to do], being the start of WWIII - and the troops are barely starting to move on both sides when a terrifying new idea of nuclear battlefields rears its head.

That's why tiny devices like that were targeted by weapons-reduction treaties - large nuclear weapons stabilise the world, but putting them into various formerly-conventional settings does not.

This is exactly what I think about Holtby. He reads the flow of the game so well, but he still makes silly choices about which passes to make and which not to, and he still tries to make something huge happen every time he has the ball at his feet; he doesn't need to.

Virtually all of our ""missiles, boats, planes, and army"" systems include alternative, old-school guidance systems that'll keep working without it.

HawkUK is correct, our nuclear missiles are designed by default to assume GPS is compromised or unavailable - after all, they are for use in a state of total war - and like many spacecraft, they have 'star-tracker' sensors to accurately calculate their position as they ascend and descend. Like a computer with a sextant. Totally US-independent.  
Even operations that usually rely on GPS, like both commercial and military shipping and aviation, are not naive enough to assume it'll always be there. Training for its absence is regular.

I cheated though and watched the first two episodes of season 5 before even starting season 4. I was hoping to acclimate myself a little so that 10's departure wouldn't be so traumatic. Ha! It was still utterly heartbreaking, but it meant that I didn't absolutely hate Smith.

I kind of like that it's totally revamped. It makes it so it seems like a completely new show. I miss 10 a lot and any reminder of him at this point makes me want to cry, so I'm happy there's not a lot in season 5 that does remind me of him. I like that they film mostly in a small village rather than London all the time. I like Amy and Rory together as companions and that there's no romantic tension between the Doctor and his companion. For now. It is strange that there's a crack in every episode. It threads them all together and I was really used to each episode kind of standing on its own. Not sure if I like that part or not. Guess I'll see where it leads and decide from there.

A someone else pointed out, it doesn't take place 14 years after the 4 finale. He landed in 1996 when he met Amelia.

My only gripe at this point is the increase of 2-parters. I just can't *not* watch the second or even third part of an episode series. So it means I'm spending a lot more time watching than I used to. I guess that's not really a bad thing, haha.

why do you think shops specifically categorise products by type and area in any way and it isn't a random assortment of items with no themes or classification. (why do they need an aisle type at all?)

I will spare you the mental anguish and tell you its so the consumer can navigate and find products (and be marketed to) with relative ease, consumer experience is a vital component of business.

Your mistake (one of many) is you seem to not understand that exposing a product to what has either been historically the larger of the two markets or believed to be (with relatively good reason)  a greater likelihood to appeal to a certain market type, you are more likely to sell more units.

I love how you condemn this practice as ""damaging"", and thinking i don't even try and ""Understand it""

The reality is i understand only too well, and that perceived gender stereotypes are reinforced by the exposure of specific categories wrt to marketing and products (from television to literature).

But the difference is that I am not so stupid to insist to artificially sanitise society and remove any implied popularity or trend with gender because I am too incompetent a parent to inform or guide my child wrt to personal liberty and individual tastes.

Instead I would try and bring my child up to understand the complexities of the world and how these things come to be and what they mean, without resorting to infantile attempts at mollycoddling society to never use gender trends or categories for purchases.

Of course my thoughts on the other side of the coin are, having the police controlling it would mean that repeated missing person reports ring alarm bells with social services. This causes a care plan review which may otherwise be missed by a rushed carer who is FAR less accountable.

We're not talking surveillance of criminals, which is where I imagine your preconception of police tracking people comes from. Remember the Police are effectively social workers.
