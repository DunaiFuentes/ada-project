I disagree; I think it's limiting to think of someone versatile like Henderson as being a single-position-player only.

You're right that Allen can't play the CAM position, though. I still think it's valid to compare the two, because they're both candidates to inherit Gerrard's spot, and will be competing for it.

There's no law against speaking out about your employer (unless you've signed the official secrets act), so there's no contract or compromise agreement that can nullify that right.

However, I believe that a contract can say ""We will pay you X if you don't do Y"".  So someone might agree on a generous severance package on condition that they keep their mouth shut.  They're not prevented from legally speaking out, but if they do then they may be in breach of contract and the company could sue them to get their money back.

Torres was a gentleman right until the last hour of the transfer window, and for that I will always resent him - but we still got a fucking incredible deal. I'll never hate him for anything other than leaving. He was magical for us, the best striker in world football. He sulked on the pitch for the last few months, and it broke my heart. Torres was my first genuine love in football, and still is. I wish he would come home and turn into the Torres we know and love. Suarez, however brilliant, will never ever have as much respect from me as Torres does, even after the way he left.

I feel like Suarez has gone about this all wrong but in the other way. If he wants to leave, he needs to tell Rodgers, not the media. Submitting a transfer request is simple. If he does it now, we have the whole summer to get the best deal and line up replacements. It's clear he wants to leave, he needs to set the wheels in motion himself. Torres never talked about leaving, he just did it (in the wrong way too but that's another story).

Either way, the school has a responsibility to feed this kid; if the canteen is in-house, then the child should be fed as-per-usual and have his account debited and his parents contacted (calling a number with no answer does not constitute contact, btw). If the canteen is subcontracted to a third party, then someone from that firm would have to get the nod from the school to feed the child. The contractor wouldn't lose any money as they are only collecting money for the school; the dinner money of the children doesn't directly pay for the food or the kitchen. The canteen gets paid by the school either way.

As for why this is a big deal, it's not *really* because it's obviously a one-off incident. The issue people have is that a service (free at the point of use care) is being withdrawn for trivial and almost vexatious reasons. 

What if the *entire* canteen closed for the day?

Firstly, Prism and [Echelon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHELON) are employed by the USA and its intellgience counterparts around the world; Prism may well not have the bulk of its facilities hosted within UK, But both Prism and Echelon facilities are used as a methodology to indentify and collate intelligence data by the CIA, NSA, and the UK SIS (Which will include MI5, MI6, Army and Naval Intel) - the justification is that the methods employed (i.e. wiretapping, data transfer surveillance and deep packet inspection as well as server level intrusions) are done so by mandate, completely legally and within the constraints of British law in our case - the problem is that the USA has a *huge* problem recognising the concept of sovereign territory unless it happens to be theirs when it comes to Military and Intelligence matters, so there would be absolutely nothing in it for UKgov to simply allow the CIA and NSA offices within the UK to go about their business under the express agreement that anything relevant would immediately be passed along to the liason desk at Thames House.

Let me be clear; Echelon and PRISM are things that I personally am not opposed to - my alarm bells went ringing the moment I heard William Hague declare that the only people that had something to fear ""were the guilty"". Who are the guilty? Which targets are they identifying? The very manner in which Mr. Hague address the issue so nonchalantly and matter of factly is something to look at - he informed the house quite clearly that every information we use and gather, is gathered within the confines of the law; there is nothing so overt as a set of conditions that allow a non-sovereign intelligence gathering agency  to surveil the British people, but there are facilities within anything from the Digital Economy Bill to the Anti Terrorism laws that allow the government in power to do pretty much *whatever they damned well please* in the pursuit of ""freedom and security for all"", and the worst thing is, that we the people have been completely complicit in all of it. We have handed over personal freedom after personal freedom, and the greatest joke of it all? We don't even know it's happened, and won't until it's too late.

Children and parents have no such responsibility, as individual consumers.

The cost and responsibility of the child's discomfort is entirely the responsibility of the parent in this issue.

They even point out under the old system there were many unpaid and numerous debts. So they have every right not to extend credit to parents because they are too incompetent and lazy to actually look after their children properly or honour their debts.

It massively pisses me off demanding parents expect the school to make up the difference because they are so irresponsible and incapable of looking after their children.

I still find it unbelievable you are effectively arguing being hungry over a 2hour period as if it's some moral disgrace.

true,Aesir81,present,Fernando Torres,"Being from the US with no ties to English football, for me it was always about the players.  As a teenager, I enjoyed watching any matches I could get my hands on.  I had mid-90s Manchester United and Juventus jerseys along with the iconic checkered black/red/yellow diamond pattern German national team jerseys that I'd wear regularly when I'd go to kick around, back when Giggs and Scholes were youngsters.  Back then you'd be very fortunate to see a few EPL games on US TV.  The first team I really followed closely was the '94 US World Cup team - Lalas, Agoos, Pope, Wynalda, Reina, Cobi, Harkes, Meola, etc.  After the World Cup, I followed the development of the MLS very closely because there was a good chance Washington, DC was going to get a team, which meant I'd get to see professional games in person.  When they did, it was awesome and I followed them closely - Moreno, Dias Arce, el Diablo, Harkes, Pope, Agoos, etc - loved those guys.  By my early 20s though, I didn't have much time to follow the sport (nor did I have the cable package to do so) due to college life and stuff and being broke.  

By my late 20s, I was more settled and had the time and interest to begin following a team or two.  I'd had good memories of watching premier league games growing up, and by this point in my life, EPL games were being aired fairly regularly on US TV, so I decided to pick an EPL team.  I really enjoyed Lampard and Drogba, and Torres was one of my favorites (although he was at Liverpool then).  When he moved to Chelsea, I got pretty excited because they were already one of my more-watched teams.

true,Himinahomina,alt1,Ryan Ledson Hypetrain,"&gt; I am not. I am not saying 'he is going to be shit for us'. I am post judging his Wigan side, which was very poorly coached and seemed pretty clueless at times.

* You say it was poorly coached yet his work at Swansea is still highly held in regard by most and his work at Wigan earned him to be courted for the Liverpool job. His defensive side appears weak but hopefully with a strong back four already cemented he can't go too wrong.

&gt; On the field captain and club captain are two distinctively different roles. What Neville did was drive the team and the youth off the pitch, and did so in a way very few players will be able to do. 

* I know they are different roles but Neville himself has come out and said that Jags as acted as both for the past 6 months while Neville has been dropped/injured. Neville was a great captain but it's not like it's being handed over to a new signing. It's going to Jags who's respected by all in the club. He's a starting England international ffs.

&gt; Losing all of these players (and Lescott) has resulted in us going on woeful runs of form that has seen us right at the bottom of the league.

* Have we finished bottom of the league once? No. Only top half and each of those players were replaced by better or equivalent players.

&gt; Maybe not better, but comparable. Newcastle at full strength I would say is better than us by some margin on paper.

You're seriously discounting our players here. They're the same players who played the then champions off the park. Newcastle finished 16th last year and they could well have their best players taken as Cabaye and Ben Arfa could play Champions League.

&gt; Convenient you pick Naismith here, not the squad players who have done decent enough- Gibbo was a smaller name that nobody wanted for example- even Oviedo has done OK for a FT, offering a rest for players on the left when needed. 

* Gibbo was never bought to be a squad player. He's a starter and was a bargain from Man Utd. He didn't come from a bottom half side and was giving a glowing recommendation from Fergie to Moyes. Oviedo is still an unknown quantity as he's only started 3 games for us but admittedly has looked bright in places. He also wasn't a free but undisclosed, believed to be around £4-5 m.

&gt; This is so wrong it is insane. He is 5 times the player Duffy is- is a born leader and the archetypal 'traditional CB' who has shown consistant performances both for club and country at a very young age. 

* He didn't shine in the Premier League for Blackburn and wasn't a stand out in the championship last year like other CB's we've signed from lower leagues (Lescott, Jags). Duffy didn't look out of place when he came in for a few games last year or the year before. Duffy's also Ireland's U-21 captain so apparently he's a leader as well.

&gt; Drenthe was an outcast, Fellaini was way overpriced and we were the only interested club willing to put down the cash, Baines was a small name when we bought him and Pienaar was a squad player in a side we are supposedly challenging against. There is not a 'big name' in that bunch when we signed them.

* I didn't say they were big names but quality players. Drenthe is quality but has personal problems. Pienaar was a big name from Dortmund and quality and Baines and Fellaini are quality players. We may have splashed the cash on Felli but he's going to make a profit whenever he does go.

&gt; I don't think you are understanding the concept of a squad player here, Alcaraz is someone to fit in when needed, not a £15-20m player like Idi who has got the big boys like Inter and Arsenal after him. Just like with Fellaini we cannot attract people like him unless we are prepared to blow our entire budget on them, which I don't feel is good business. 

* I didn't say to sign those players as squad players. They would most likely start, bringing the age down of the squad and making it a stronger one with players like Distin to come in when needed. And while yes they would cost a lot, the new TV rev and player sales would mean a bigger budget, so more to spend to ensure quality.",0,1371062717,null,0,false,0,cahirhj,t3_1g6ts9,t1_cahirhj,t1_cahgygh,null,1430833649,1,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,1

&gt; according to unverified documents seen by the Post, the NSA had been hacking computers in Hong Kong and on the mainland since 2009. None of the documents revealed any information about Chinese military systems, he said.

&gt;One of the targets in the SAR, according to Snowden, was Chinese University and public officials, businesses and students in the city. The documents also point to hacking activity by the NSA against mainland targets.

&gt;Snowden believed there had been more than 61,000 NSA hacking operations globally, with hundreds of targets in Hong Kong and on the mainland.

&gt;“We hack network backbones – like huge internet routers, basically – that give us access to the communications of hundreds of thousands of computers without having to hack every single one,” he said.

61000 globally. Hundreds in HK. So, assuming this is true and more info is going to be released what are the chances some of this isn't in the EU?

Strangely, diplomatic plates look _almost_ the same as normal ones but have a slightly different font - you can spot them around the West End quite often, they start with an odd-looking D.

Loads of fun. From 125 tyres to this, the price difference lets you appreciate the cheapness of the smaller capacity bikes - as well as the fuel economy. Then again, this is an I4 with a redline of 13.5k, so that was sort of to be expected. She's a bit unforgiving, but the engine is essentially a detuned CBR400RR lump.

A friend of mine has a GS500E and said it felt really economical - not in the good way. I was looking at getting a CB500 and anyone I've spoken to has nothing but praise for them. Take from that what you will, but I've never ridden one so can't really say too much.

Someone I know has an SV650 but didn't really say too much, we were mainly talking about how he crashed it overtaking 6 cars at once on a single carriageway road. Sounds and looks the part, I guess it'd make a nice all rounder

They have lots of touring productions throughout the year - there's usually something new on every week, though not everything will be equally interesting. The Burton Taylor studio is attached to the playhouse and often has some more experimental/left-field sort of stuff if you're into that. 

The [New Theatre](http://www.atgtickets.com/venues/new-theatre-oxford/) is the place to go if 'shows' (i.e. musicals) are your thing, sometimes they have more highbrow stuff too like opera and ballet. 

Some slightly smaller venues to investigate: 
[The North Wall Arts Centre](http://www.thenorthwall.org/) - in Summertown. 
[The Old Fire Station](http://www.oldfirestation.org.uk/event_type/theatre-event/) - newly refurbished!
[Pegasus](http://www.pegasustheatre.org.uk/) - in East Oxford.

There are also lots of student productions on during the academic year but that's just about done for now.

The one thing I'd recommend that's coming up soon is the annual outdoor Shakespeare in the Old School's quad of the Bodleian library! A very nice way to spend a summer's evening.

true,ragewind,uk,,"&gt;It essentially comes down to this. PRISM, is a US system operating within the bounds of US law (take that for what you will). 

they hack any nation they want in the name of security they have been reported and admitted that they targetforeign national targets 

&gt;It does not operate in the UK, as that would be a clear violation of our sovereignty.

they dont care

&gt;It seems that some of you think that EU servers are automagically added to this system. 

a back door in to any cloud service that is based in the US but is multi national is a back door in to all the country's of its users. if they can back door to outlook.com then it dosnt stop at the US boarder its the same system same code some access 

&gt;Which I agree, would be abhorrent. But, it just simply is not the case (under most situations described in comments so far).

im glad you know for sure that they arnt it seems you know more than the NSA impressive

&gt;Why do you think we should have any say on how the US treats data in gathers from geographically US servers?

basic human rights? its basically banned by there own constitution? when we let one country abuse its power it becomes normal!

&gt;Yes. We have organisations like GCHQ which have been allowed access to this system (which personally, I think a US citizen should be more concerned about, than us). And they make specific (and very limited) requests for data on UK threats. It is again worth repeating, that the data it will get access too would be data a Briton has intentionally placed on a US system, not a British/EU one (usually).

users of Gmail/hotmail/facebook dont intentionally hide date in the US but they have no way of stooping it get there

&gt;We collectively get annoyed when the US meddles in our affairs. Yet here we are critiquing theirs and demanding our government pressure them to make changes.

we comment on abuses any ware 

&gt;I will however admit there is a slight complication. And that concerns the US FISA and Patriot Act, which allows the US Government to pressure US companies into giving them access to data they deem relevant for national security. These acts state for example, that a US corporate server hosted in the UK can have its data exfiltrated to US authorities, regardless of our law. This is of a concern for example, to users of Office 365, Gmail, Facebook, etc, who have EU operations hosted within the EU but are US companies. However there has been no indication as of yet that this provision has been added to PRISM. I really must stress however, that a UK company operating within the EU is absolutely not effected by this. And as such any data you put on their EU servers is not subject to any of these issues.

most major systems and IT company's are in some part based in the US so they can have legal access to your non US data and thats before you get to the out right hacking and illegal activity that the secret services are know for not doing... right

&gt;It is the unresolved contradiction between the US FISA/Patriot Act and the EU DPD what you should be angry about. It should not be the almost automated data collection system of PRISM. It should be the EU is not enforcing its own Data Protection Directive and Safe Harbor laws to an agreeable extent and forcing companies operating in the EU to guarantee the protection of the data stored here or within the registered Safe Harbor. FISA and The Patriot Act have existed and contradicted EU laws for US-EU companies for several years, yet nothing has been done and attention is only being drawn now from a very thinly related subject! You should also be concerned about the lack of EU specific alternatives to your favorite US services.

its hard to enforce your law on a NSA system you dont know about even if the EU authorities are bad at there job

&gt;If I am wrong, please to God enlighten me. Because this is the type of shit I have to consult on regularly and I'd rather not be spinning crap to clients.

you are offering certain and facts you have no way of proving, you cant say that the Us arnt fucking with our data as you dont have access to there systems to check

in short you are an idiot for thinking that our laws will have protected you from the NSA

Seems they did allow it but parents couldn't be trusted to settle their debts or take responsibility to settle them quickly, hence the school brought in that rule (read the article)

If parents expect the school to offer them credit or a service of loan when they have repeatedly been irresponsible and careless to not repay or settle in a timely manner they can properly go get fucked.

Their hungry children are entirely their own fault. I have zero sympathy, and just anger at the self entitled blame someone else mentality of bad and lazy parents who cant be bothered to look after their children properly.

true,Sir_Fancy_Pants,null,null,"&gt;Fuck the school for using the kid as a financial lien. The debt could be a hundred pounds before the thought of not feeding a child should cross their mind.

So lets use your complete absence of logic and substitution of wild hysteria in reverse.

Couple of hundred pounds in debt you say before ending credit? lets assume the school has 1000 pupils.

SO you expect the school budget to allow for up to £200,000 of unaccounted or unsettled debt (why should this kid be any more special than any other)

this money has to come from somewhere, so lets make a statement that each life saving cancer treatment costs £10,000

So in you mind you would rather have a whole school of children not go hungry for 3 hours longer than normal (lunch to hometime) than save 20 peoples lives?

or put another way you would let 20 people die, so that a school full of kids could  not be hungry for 3 hours for however many days.

Its really easy to claim moral high ground and criticise decisions, thinking you know what is best when you are not actually expected to pay for it or find the money.

Why don't you personally donate at least £500-£1000 to the school for an emergency lunch money fund? or do you expect some other area to pay for it all (such as the NHS)

So please where does all this money come from that you are willing to spend on issuing credit to lazy parents? leukemia treatments? burns victims? how about fewer ambulances or even fewer teachers or nurses.

Don't try and claim you are somehow better or more moral than those who are constrained by reality and budgets.

While you're right about the costs of mass production, that's some assumption to make without checking if you're going to start changing plugs. Sure, it's cheaper to make universal power supplies, but not necessarily to make them switch automatically. Maybe you you'll get a universal unit but with a hidden physical switch/jumper/whatever, set just before the unit is sealed.

What I'm familiar with is PC power supplies. The older ones always used to have a physical switch - and you *did* get a nice fireworks display if you set it to 120V then plug it in a UK supply. I know that because I once told my step-sister not to worry about pressing the wrong key for an old PC I gave her - whatever she pressed wouldn't damage it. I wasn't there when she saw that red switch on the back of the power supply, but I do know she's even *more* phobic about computers now.

They had a far better kill to loss ratio and extra range to escort bombers all the way into Germany. They had more powerful guns, more ammo, better armor, a fuel tank that was more secure etc. Göring himself said that when he saw Mustangs flying mover Germany, he knew the war was over. 

And the RAF didn't have a 2:1 kill ratio in BoB, it was about 1:1. The reason the Germans lost more pilots was because they had bombers in the battle while the RAF only had fighters and bombers require an entire crew and are more vulnerable. And there was no way air supremacy let alone air superiority was established over France in late 1941, other wise the invasion of France would have taken place in 1942 or 1943 and not 1944. By then the Luftwaffe was still formidable and they were only destroyed as a fighting force about a year after the US joined the war.

And sure you can pull out a few examples of US mistakes in the war, but overall if you think of how involved the US was and what big of an impact they had, while only loosing about 400,000 men; it's pretty amazing. I think it's established that the Pacific front was pretty much won by the US (although the British Empire and China certainly did help a lot) but it's rubbish to say the US wasn't involved in Europe because the major battles in the Western Front (Bulge, Push to Rhine, Push inwards of Germany) had mostly American men. And the RAF did not have the resources to establish Air Superiority over Europe, that was the USAF (although the Royal Navy was far superior to the Kreigsmarine).

true,Halk,scot-lanarkshire,Lanarkshire,"&gt;Domestic violence is by and large perpetrated by men on women.

That perception is pretty much the problem. A significant amount of domestic violence is perpetrated by women on men. Figures are hard to obtain but I've just done some googling and the NHS says that the British Crime Survey said that over 1/4 of the incidents were against men. Given that it's widely accepted that men are less likely to come forward than women, I'd say that your statement saying it's ""by and large"" is utterly wrong. 

The problem is a sexist media perception that it's a men vs women issue - it isn't. If the very first thing done on a debate in the commons about media sexism is to straight away turn it into a men vs women thing then the debate is off to a bad start, and Lucas has done nobody any favours.

Sexist attitudes are put forward by both men and women about both men and women. It's not just men vs women and women vs men.

Right, because you know, people can't save for their retirement themselves, they need the government to do it!

&gt; Short answer... It would seem that people of the 18-24 age group at least (of which I was recently a member) are more likely to be arseholes. Less caring about others, more interested in number one.

No, they're just more likely to not conform to the absolute power that is the government than people who are older and are far more likely to conform. [I got that from Ron Paul, FYI](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkg9SQwQYaE).

It is very difficult to buy a player like Suarez.

But this is, as the article states, a response to the fact that the police failed to respond to people's calls for help in an abusive relationship.  Perhaps the police need to simply respond more promptly to domestic abuse cases and take them more seriously.  

If there is such a database of violent men, does a woman call it up and say: ""Have you got Joe Bloggs on your database""?  Do the police then say ""no, we've never heard of him"" or, ""no, but since you asked, we'll keep an eye on him for you""?

This is another part that worries me: "" Target repeat perpetrators with the help of the Crown Prosecution Service by pursuing ""victimless prosecutions – evidence-based cases where the alleged victim is unwilling to co-operate.""

Is this legal? I understand the reasoning behind it, that some women want to protect their abusive partners, but this would seem to create a precedent that the police can prosecute a crime without anyone accusing them of a crime.

16million more then arsenal and 45 million less then city. 

with quite a few earners leaving the club it will probably reduce unless we go on a signing spree. malouda alone would make nearly 5-6million i think, along with turnbull, hilario, ferriera and benayoun going i think we could get close to 10 million off the books before we sign anyone. if torres leaves thats another 8million with some other fringe players leaving i can see chelsea getting 20million reduction. 

if we sign 2 big name players and 2 potentials as we seem to be aiming for that would probably eat at most of the 20 million but hopefully not all.

true,Shrub_Rocketeer,eu,Wales,"A large amount of violence against women also goes unreported, and the conviction rate for reported rapes is startlingly low - so I don't think that my statement was ""utterly wrong"".  Naturally, the media focuses more on male-on-female domestic violence because there is more of it; this may be unfortunate, but that's how the media generally operates, whatever the issue.  I don't see the problem with complaining about male-on-female violence without necessarily mentioning that men also suffer domestic violence, just as I wouldn't have a problem with an MP complaining about female-on-male violence without mentioning male-on-female violence.  But perhaps women are more likely to spend more time complaining about male-on-female violence than female-on-male violence in the same way that a Jew will spend more time opposing anti-semitism than he/she will opposing anti-black racism, and vice versa.  It's not a sign of hypocrisy *per se*.

""The officer says that he shouted out 'knife' so as to warn his colleagues, at which point, Mr Emmanuel, he says, held out his arm and screamed at Witness Two: 'Do you want some of this?'

""Witness Two will tell you that Mr Emmanuel's face and body language had completely changed, he became angry and was screaming.

""He will tell you that he, Mr Emmanuel, then held the knife with both hands and plunged it into his own chest.""

The 48-year-old singer, who found fame with a string of 1980s hits including Cockney Translation and who appeared on Top of the Pops, was found to have died from a single stab wound to the heart.

The four police officers present in Mr Emmanuel's house in Hillbury Road at the time of his death have been granted anonymity by Mr Travers.

The inquest continues.

the facts
he had a knife. shouted ambigous threats.
he was under suspicion of importing cocaine from the carribean.
the circumstances are mysterious but then their is no evidence of mistreatment from the police.
lets face the facts he was probably operating with a gang that was probably powerful and maybe co operated with the police or would have killed more people if he hadnt sacrificed himself.

i think personally the reason for his death was to do with serious drugs gangs and serious corruption for the sheer scale of this look at daniel morgan the private investigator murdered in 1987. he got too close to corruption in the police with drugs gangs in london and he paid with his life.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Morgan_%28private_investigator%29
they only managed to get a indepent trial for him this year.

london is a seriously corrupt place if you have the right price, you can buy anything.
london cheap cocaine 10 percent pure.
www.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7693920.stm‎

The Border Agency estimated the drugs’ value at $82 million wholesale, with a street value of $493 million. It said the cocaine, which originated in South America, was 90 percent pure. The average purity of cocaine seized at the British border is 63 percent.

true,binaryv01d,null,null,"I don't see why there's such a campaign to ban Page 3. 

Surely the real problem that needs to be tackled is that there are a huge number of people who *actually want to read The Sun*. This is a paper with a history of straight-up lying, moronic scare stories, celebrity dross, illegal behaviour and extremely cynical political campaigning, all run by the closest thing the world has to a corporate supervillain.

The fact that millions of people treat The Sun as a reliable source of information and allow it to shape their every opinion belies a much greater problem in society. Banning Page 3 ('because it seems a bit sleazy in 2013!') is never going to solve this underlying issue.

What's the solution? Education. Children and teenagers need to understand the value of critical thinking and at least a passing interest in politics. The reason that The Sun and Page 3 still exist is a combination of credulity and endemic apathy. 

Many people either don't realise that The Sun, The Mirror and the Daily Mail are fabricated and sensationalised. Alternatively, they don't give a shit - being informed isn't important. Ironically, they have no interest in being involved with the process of shaping the country's future through political participation - but they're the first to be up in arms when a tabloid starts slagging off the government.

In fact the same goes for every paper - they all have notable biases. However, I think that if people were reading the Times, Guardian, Independent or Telegraph we would still be in a much better state. Heck, we'd even be in a better state if people demanded *actual fucking news* from the tabloids.

The reason politicians can get away with stupid shit like the Communications Data Bill, vapid education/health reforms and Nadine Dorries' continued existence is because nobody knows about these things. The Sun is more concerned with top stories like 'Page 3 girls uncovered! We go behind-the-scenes at sizzling Ibiza party pad' and 'Caprice to have two babies in four weeks' (I shit you not, that is actually their top news story right now. Who?)

true,[deleted],null,null,"I don't think the false 9 really killed us so much as being a worse team and happening to meet them in the best of form while we were at our worst. IIRC Hazard actually created a couple of chances. I think what you are saying about using a false 9 in a 4-3-3 makes sense, given the untracked runs in from wide position once a CB is pulled out of position, but Juve did play with a back 3 so it's a little different and I'm not quite sure of the intricacies there. I think it still would have worked with the deceptive runs coming from the middle (Mata and Oscar) and it did to some effect but our finishing was poor.

My comment about Drogba was just that we got so overran in the midfield that game, and we would have under almost any formation we could have thought of, that our only successful attack plan could have been something along the lines hoof it to Drogba and let him do the work. A hold up false 9 definitely works, but it could still work with easily without it (Messi/Fabregas) so long as there was good service coming in through the midfield.

true,ashmaht,tardis,TARDIS,"Well, he has 8's shirt and 9's jacket. We're fairly sure that 8 was the incarnation who fought in the Time War. And, if 8 was in fact the incarnation who fought in the Time War, he was also the incarnation that essentially committed the genocide of the Time Lords and the Daleks by trapping them in the war forever. Now, you raise a good point about Hurt being an older version of one of the Doctor's faces, just older. Well, the only one who could've gotten older without us seeing it happen is 8. 

It's all well and good that Clara wouldn't have seen 10.5 in the Doctor's time stream because he's a different entity but you also need to take into account that she didn't witness EVERY MOMENT of the Doctor's life, just the snippets altered by the GI (at least based on what we saw). 

I'm not saying your theory is invalid, just that older 8 is a simpler explanation than older 10.5 and the simplest conclusion is usually the right one. 

Given Moffat's writing style, events will likely play out like so: We all know the Doctor had some kind of a family. At the very least, he had a granddaughter (or someone who was close enough to, to call his granddaughter). All Time Lords were called in for the Time War. And the Doctor was on the front lines. Maybe it was a case of friendly fire. Maybe one of the Doctor's relatives went bad and he had to take them down. Either way, someone the Doctor cared about got hurt bad. And he ran away. He couldn't let them die. Not them. Anyone else but please not them. So he trapped them. He trapped all of them. In a single instant. A moment. Repeating forever. Everybody lives. Just this once. And forever. 

Maybe that was the terrible thing. He damned them all forever. For his own mistake.",0,1371101384,null,0,false,0,cahxa4t,t3_1g8vog,t1_cahxa4t,t1_cahwz83,null,1430826664,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

He'll be able to play the Henderson role, while offering a lot more offensively.

Eriksen's a brilliant player that would another dimesion of creativity and control to our attack, but it does seems like he's inconsistent. Our scouts probably watched him while he was in a run of poor form, leading them to push Mkhitaryan ahead as our main target for AM. I wouldn't have a problem if we went for him if we're unable to get Mkhitaryan, but AC Milan seem like his most likely destination right now.

[Not sure i can agree with you about Henderson refusing to ""make a risky forward pass""](http://youtu.be/O8bBkeD3Lm0)

In particular 1:27, but of course 2:24 though that is from a deeper position.

Granted this is U21s so it's not terribly indicative of how he had played for us, it shows he's capable and willing to make these types of passes. He's been played out wide for a lot of his career because he has the ability to swing balls into the box similar to Gerrard's. I like him playing LAM or RAM, really anywhere in the midfield other than CDM.

He is a winger, despite what he claims, and Ronaldo really isn't. He also is not a free kick taker. He does take pens, but that still won't add up to enough. The thing with people like Ronaldo and Messi is they really can score from the run of play (regularly) and are their teams main penalty and free kick takers.

Hazard could easily inherit the penalty taking from Lampard, and without any hesitation from Chelsea fans, but I don't want him taking free kicks in front of Mata and David Luiz.

HC2 (full) or HC3 (partial) cover costs of all NHS work done, and are awarded on how much you earn/ own. They ask questions about your salary, rent, life savings and property to evaluate how rich you are and whether you deserve free stuff. 

Majority of students would easily qualify. They are judged on a yearly basis, regardless of age or occupational status (obviously you don't qualify if you earn good money)

Otherwise, yes to paying. Prescriptions are £7, dental check up (Tier 1) is £17 (iirc, I'm in the US atm), Tier 3 is about £189 (root canals etc) 

But please correct me on those last figures!





Edit: Also, cut off is when you leave education - June! but most doctors won't know and will continue paying free prescriptions til September if you don't tell them.

These are not facts.  They are allegations by witnesses.  Unnamed witnesses, who are presumably the unnamed police officers involved in the incident.  The coroner is just setting out for the jury the evidence they will hear.  It's for the jury to decide what the facts actually were.

Let's wait and see shall we?  The coroner's trial is ongoing, and you're already prejudging it in favour of the initial police evidence.

http://global3.memecdn.com/Education-1960-vs-2010_o_78042.jpg

Bottom line:

* parents lapsed into debt with school

* parents contacted 3 times about debt and what would happen

* parents did nothing to resolve debt

* parents did not make packed lunch for child

* parents neglected their child and let him go hungry

* parents didn't take responsibility for mistake and decided to uproot him from school (a process which I'm sure the kid also hates)

Ergo, **bad parenting**, not bad schooling. 21st century entitled parents who think the school is to blame for their mistakes. If this was the 1960s it wouldn't be news it would all be on the parents, not the school.

true,Nathed1,null,null,"The invasion of europe was off the cards until 1944 due to lack of troops and equipment plus waiting for the second Western front to be opened in Italy  not lack of air cover over France .  

The P51 and P47 had better flight time but in dog fights the Spitfire IX was more manoeuvrable and faster accelerating than both aircraft . it also had a harder hitting gun package than the P51 , having 2 X 20mm cannon and 4 .303 (which though weaker singly could shred a target at less than 200 yrds ) or 2 .50 guns . The 20mm would take just 2 - 3 hits to down a target .  The P47 gun package was truely awesome . 

When you compare the flying styles of the Spitfire and P-51/ P47 they are very different . The Spitfire was a sports car but the P51/P47 were more like Lincons .  As out and out dog fighters the spitfire was a better aircraft being much more stable in turns with a bigger margin for handling errors being less prone to snap spins , stalls at high angle of attack and faster roll rates than either of the big American fighters .  Of course the American fighters had longer legs suiting them to long range escort duties and deeper penetration raider missions  against German air fields deeper on the Franco Germanic boarder .   

As for Not the forces to establish air superiority of France in June 1940 RAF Fighter Command had 763 serviceable aircraft with 700 front line fighter pilots , by October 1940 they had 1300 front line in service airframes with 1200 front line pilots with another 300 undergoing training or in reserve which was more than the Germans had at the end of the BoB (due to having to move pilots and frames to night fighter duties and preparing to open up the eastern front .   RAF fighters and attack planes roamed over France quite happily from  early 1941 on . Where they couldn't attack was the Franco Germanic border and thats where the 8th Air force really stepped in and butcher the German fighters .  The preparations were set up by RAF FC and BC in 1941 with the south , north and western France having very little in the way of day fighter opposition  compared to the previous year . German airfields were pulled back further and further into central France as they were loosing more and more aircraft on the ground and unable to replace them quick enough .  (production figures show the UK industry was able to produce 8 spitfires for every 3 Me-109 and 2 FW190 ) .


P47's had a major setback  in terms of fighting , they were slow to turn and roll below speeds of 250mph and would bleed a lot of energy turning . Staple tactic for the P47 was a Boom and Zoom , if a pilot had to turn with the opponent then he would become a sitting duck . It was also slow to respond to throttling up . while acceleration was fast the initial acceleration was slightly slower than the FW190 and 109K4 . For example  The P47D-25 had a much lower climb rate than either the 109K4 and FW190D9 (it's main adversaries) it was also up to 50mph slower than the K4 . The 190D9 also could roll faster at all speeds and between 275mph and 375 mph had a tighter turn radius and faster turn rate than the P47 .  The gun package on the FW190D9 was better than the 8 .50 on the P47D25 (though most common load out was the 6 .50 to make room for extra fuel and to better the handling of the P47) .  

On the whole I would say that no single fighter was ""The best fighters of the war""  as each had their strengths and weaknesses . Personally i really really like the P47 , it was a great fighter but it never out shone other fighters , there was always something out there that could do things better than it .  It's the same for every fighter during WWII . Spitfires could out turn FW190's but not out roll it or climb as fast , the 109 K4 could go faster than the spitfire and out climb it but the P47 could out dive the K4 .  

The kill ratio for RAF FC to luft fighters was 1.89 :1 in favour to the RAF , that's close enough to 2:1 . plus a lost fighter did not mean a lost pilot .  The air war in Europe was far more complex than most people give credit to it .  Building blocks were set out quite early and the Allied forces took their time to set up ready for an invasion of France .  


Whats your opinion on the Spitfire Mk XIV  good plane or bad? or the P47D-11? How about the P51A-1  ? How about the Spitfire Mk XII ?  Mustang II B ?   or the Hawker Typhoon / Tempest ?

true,WarOnHugs,null,null,"1 - Yes. There are really no technical weaknesses in his game and he is exceptional with the ball at his feet, something that should be valued in a CB. I can see him becoming as good as Thiago Silva who right now sets the bar for world class CBs.

2 - I personally always thought his mistakes were exaggerated but he has cut them out (mostly) regardless - he's certainly no more of a liability than Cahill (positioning), Terry (pace) or Ivanovic (concentration). It was never a question of ability but rather maturity with Luiz, and in this respect he can only get better.

3 - That is a lot of cards even for 60 games played. It has to do with his style though as an anticipatory/proactive defender.

4 - Ok, Luiz is NOT a CDM. While he did score some sexy goals playing there his actual performances left much to be desired. He lacks the positional awareness and discipline to play there. Benfica for example ran us ragged in midfield and were able to run between the lines straight at our defence much too easily - this actually happened in multiple games that he played there. As a tempo setter he is equally shaky, while I appreciate Luiz being more adventurous than Mikel he would often hurriedly ping balls up to nobody. People see David Luiz's ball skill and our lack of solid options for the pivot and think he is the answer, but his skillset is much better suited to playing CB.

5 - Yes, he is an authoritative leader on the pitch (both by example and rallying) and a great ambassador off of it.

6 - He would be perfect for Barca because he's a ball playing defender who likes to play a high line. I don't see Mourinho booting him he's extremely similar to Varane and Sergio Ramous especially.

Aside from the stonking goals (every one a beauty) I think he's proven he can play both DM and CB roles equally well, saved our asses too many times to count last season, pushed the team forward when in midfield, and has greatly reduced the number of silly mistakes. His greatest strength is his enthusiasm - you can see the way he motivates all the players around him, and strikes fear into the heart of the opposition. Ironically this is also his greatest weakness, occasionally he gets a bit carried away (heavy tackles, shoulder charges,  etc)

I have no doubt Mourinho will bring out the best in him, hopefully get him to play with a cooler head, and cut out any errors, while making him more central to play. This season I fully expect him to reach new highs. 

I'm pretty certain all these Barca rumours are nonsense.

Now, in truth as good as Sneijder is we have a solid midfield that could use some experience and direction and maybe another creative type player but it is certainly good enough to drive for a CL slot when all are healthy (Sandro and Dembele are as good as they get in the PL when healthy). Now when Sneijder is healthy, in shape and on form well...he's Wesley fucking Sneijder isn't he, he's is amongst the best in the world.  But he is getting older, seems to be carrying a little knock here and there all the time and would take time away from 2 very talented youngsters that we need to get experience for....so for the expenditure of Sneijder's wages plus the fee i would pass on Sneijder.

However if Levy could pull a rabbit out of his hat and get him cheap and on wages that fit our structure....well, its Wesley fucking Sneijder isn't it?

Coulibaly just turned 18 and looked decent in his loan spell to Italy (regardless of what the post linked in OP says, he didn't get many minutes but was great when he came on. The crowd even was cheering for his name at times to come on). That gives him 5+ years to continue working on his game until he catches up to Naughton in age. That is half a damn career. 

The OP is just flat out wrong when he says that Coulibaly failed at youth level as well, he played 190 minutes (equal to 2 full games essentially) for 1 goal and 3 assists in U-21's. That is awesome. If you watch him play as well you will realize that he hits the post 20 times a match but constantly beats his man or makes the right move or does something awesome to get into a goalscoring opportunity.

true,anudeglory,eng-devon,Devon,"&gt;Too many universities have had an easy time in the past, and are now being expected to deliver what they are charging for.

I think that it can translate that way, but having sat in University department meetings, it also goes another way. Many faculties are entirely ruled, even - I would say - to levels of paranoia, by the National Student Survey. 

When the increased fees came in, this fear of bad NSS reports increased exponentially. This has led to students demanding more, not necessarily a bad thing in-and-of-itself, but not in the way that you would think. All too often, it leads to students wanting more and more structure for what they are paying for.

Now there can be a debate about whether University should be about structured learning or self learning and how much you should be doing of either. But the higher fees and the NSS almost entirely dictates that what the students need to learn should be spoon-fed to them. The knock-on effect is that lecturers and researchers time suddenly has demands that are not entirely sustainable. Students demand, more feedback, better lecture materials, more practicals, less exams, more coursework. But this work load is not seeing any increase in funding, not least to those researchers who also are contracted to lecture.

That's a bit harsh to criticise the mental speed of a 19 year old playing his first season of first-team football. You don't need physical speed to be a great attacking-mid. The likes of Kaka, Rui Costa, Zidane, Riquelme, Ozil, Hamsik and Sneijder aren't/weren't particularly fast. 

Though his retention of possession belies his lack of experience I would have doubts about him being able to take the physical side of the game if he was deployed at CM. As a CAM he attempts to play in the hole behind the opposition midfield. On the left side, where he played a lot this season, he often drifted away from the RB into space in front of the defence. As a CM he'd get less time on the ball and have to withstand more physical challenges.

3) I enjoy his physical play. It gives the opposing team something to think about. He just needs to be less reckless.

4) His skillset is a CB, but his mentality is a DM. I think he enjoys playing as a DM more as it gives him more freedom. But, it might be too late for him to develop as a DM.

5) No. He is too much of a character. He is good for the team, but it would be hard to take him seriously.

1 - If we are going to spend 10m on someone, we are better to do it in one of the many positions we are in need of improving. We are currently OK down the left, but 10m reasonable, if not a tad inflated- I prefer Moses though for a wide option for similar money.

2 -  Not seen much of this guy, but from what I know he is a decent target man. £11m seems too much. 

3 - Would be nice, would also be surprising as I feel Phil is Man Utd destined.

4 - If Arsenal want him, he will go to Arsenal. He is a quality player though, who will do well for us under Martinez- would like to see this move happen, although I don't think it is too likely. 

5 - £5m seems like a reasonable price for Kone, he is certainly not an answer to all our problems, but is almost certain to get into double figures next year, which is something that we can't say about the strikers we currently have.

6 - Seems like a decent player, would add depth and chance to grow into something better- probably cheap too.

I think Enrique gets a lot of flak because sometimes he seems like a headless chicken in the final third. But defensively, he is almost faultless. He’s very good one-on-one and rarely gets beaten for pace. His performance as a winger is added bonus. I wish he gets a little more credit than he gets.

He was also involved in our two best goals this season. For me he has been our best defender this season, even better than Johnson, considering the fact that he back after a long injury.

Sometimes I fell like there is two Enrique's. One is a world class LB, and the other is a turkey with one good leg in a red kit. There is no middle ground with him.

But everywhere you look, regardless of board, paper, ITK or writer says we are without a doubt targeting 2 strikers which i took to mean that 1 of our senior strikers is going out while keeping 1 and the youth striker would be moved to the 4 slot.

Moving the youth striker to the 4 slot on the striker depth chart isn't too bad as it means we would rotate the youngsters in there for cups etc and slowly blood them.

Problem i see is that i can't see JD or Ade wanting to be in a 3-man rotation at striker and based on the names we are looking at well virtually any of them will walk into the lineup ahead of either of them.  If we drop both of them it means we have no strikers that have played any time with the rest of the team which spells the potential for a miserable start to the season for whoever it is.

I have seen Fiorentina, QPR, Sunderland and Stoke all interested in Parker as well as mention of ""other teams"", i really think given that he is 33 we will want him off the books.

As for BAE, sounds like he is being shown the door.  If thats the case i guess we would either hope to land someone like Shaw to rotate with Rose or Coentrao to start with Rose rotating.  With Rose there it just seems like a pain in the ass position to deal with.  Rose will want to start which means you would be either willing to start Rose with Naughton as backup (cringe) or find a young LB to rotate which means Rose has to play a ton of minutes (which he will love) and hope that he doesn't get hurt or you are chasing CL with a youngster, and the last option is to get a proven LB and hope Rose doesn't flip out because he isn't getting the time.",0,1371124982,null,0,false,0,cai17tt,t3_1g9eyu,t1_cai17tt,t1_cai13da,null,1430824810,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

That's because level 5+ are not supposed to represent A-A*. Level 5 is a bar, certainly, but to say that if you get level 5 and a B or C in English/Maths you've been failed by the school is unfair. What if you're excellent at primary maths, but then simply can't handle GCSE maths such as algebra, calculus or trigonometary? Have you been 'failed'? Maybe you're just bad at GCSE-level maths?


'By way of comparison, 59% of selective state school – grammar school – students who attained level five in both English and maths at the end of their primary school education went on to achieve an A or A* in those subjects at GCSE level in 2012.'


That's because most children in grammer schools are pushed there (or atypically supported) by their parents. If you collect children with parents who care about their education, they're going to do better then the general population.

Parker out would certainly mean a new midfielder in which would be interesting. No idea who it would be just now, maybe Baldini has his eye on someone.

Perhaps AVB is looking for two strikers, but one that can play multiple positions. That would give you 4 strikers (inc youth) but backups would get game time as someone like Villa could also move out to the left easily.

I really do rate this guy and watched the games he played in Italy over the past few months, he was limited to substitute appearances in a team that really struggled throughout there season. From the offset it was not the ideal place for him to go out on loan to, it would have been far better to have stayed in England whether that be in our youth set up or on loan to a championship club but allegedly he was homesick and as Siena where under a transfer embargo it left little option but for him to go to Grosseto. 

Despite this IMO he is progressing fine, he is fast, has very quick reactions, his movement is good and his finishing is exceptionally composed for someone so young. He is often called the next Drogba, this however is due to his nationality rather than his playing style. As the article says he is around 6 inches shorter than Drogba so lacks the the brute force of his compatriot. A better comparison I have seen is Eto'o but i would say an even better one would be chicharito at Man United, he likes to use his pace to run off the shoulder of defenders and is very quick to react to mistakes made by defenders.

It's not fallacious, it's a question of what will happen in the future based on student feedback. A similar pattern was seen when the fees went up for the first time (to £3k), where there was a difference in expectations between those who were paying and those who weren't.

I guess AVB doesn't like BAE (because of his attitude? or is it his style of play?). don't forget he was injured most of the year and at least one other player AVB did not like (Dawson) was able to play his way into AVB's good graces.

also, from what I have read about BAE, it seems that, while he has a cavalier attitude about playing football and being a Professional, he seems very genuine. his remarks about other players kissing badges and moving on seems to suggests his disdain for that type of behavior. he is on player who I actually will believe when he talks and says things. additionally, as he pointed out, what type of mercenary, aside of Ser Bronn of Blackwater, sticks around for 7 years? 

because of the way he appears to approach football, I would not be surprised if he was ok with being in a rotation with someone like Rose as long as his paychecks keep coming. he has so many other things going on in his life (his charity in Cameroon, I believe he was a delegate or something at some African Union or other international diplomatic meeting last year)that football isn't his be all end all. He strikes me as someone who doesn't want to be the greatest footballer ever, but a humble and great person who used his footy talent to change the world for better.

long story short, I can't see him leaving while we are still willing to write him checks to be on our team.

I will now go back to worshipping at my BAE Shrine

Edit: he was at the Africa 2.0 conference.

*Yes, he has been living up to the expectations and is definitely becoming a strong CB. I'd rather see him play in CDM though.*
 

- **He has made less misstakes this year and is not as error prone as before. Do you think Luiz will keep on improving in that regard?**


*He has indeed made less mistakes as he used to, yet he still has this dangerous approach sometimes where he takes too much risk when it has to be a 100% clear tackle/disposession.*


- **Even though he has made less misstakes he has still recieved 17 Yellow cards this season. Is he too pshysical sometimes?**


*He definitely has to stop doing his elbow-thingy. I like physically strong players, but he shouldn't do that. It is not allowed and sooner or later he is going to receive a second yellow or red card for it. So yes, as a CB he has to be more careful. You don't want to pick as much yellow cards there as you could in midfield.*


- **Should he play CB or CDM?** 


*I like him more as a CDM than as a CB. I feel like he is still making too many mistakes or putting too much risk in a tackle when playing on the CB position. IMO, he's a very good central midfield player. He has decent tactical insight, good offensive movement and his through-passes (?) are wonderful sometimes. There are a lot of people questioning his quality when he's playing in midfield, but I'm sure he's able to improve his game. However, the choices lay with him. If he wants to play CB, I'll be fine with it, because he fits in both roles.* 


- **A lot of people sees him as a future captain, thoughts?**


*Yes, I see him as a future Chelsea captain. If you look at the squad now, I don't see anyone captaining the side aside from Terry/Cole/Lampard. I don't like Cech as a Captain, because I feel like he doesn't have the influence on the field like Terry/Lampard have. Luiz is funny, he contests free-kicks, etc...* 


- **Rumours are putting him in Barcelona, do you think José wants to dump him or keep him?**  


*I stopped reading at Rumours.*



Next discussion should be either **Oscar or Marin**. 


Motivation : I don't really know anything about Marin. I have watched almost every game this season, but can't recall Marin playing (except for the preseason in the USA).

He has great skill with the ball for a CB, which allows him to also play in a DM position. When he makes mistakes, people call him out but he's done well on a number of occasions.  People seem to forget that not all CBs have to put their bodies on the line, a la JT.

2. Definitely, he will still improve. Having an energetic midfield has greatly reduced the temptation for Luiz to come bombing forward. 

3. He's a defender, they're expected to be more physical than most outfield players. At least he shows that there's a lot of different elements to his game.

4. Why not both? Having versatility is a good thing. It allows for a more dynamic game and gives enemies all sort of headaches.

Yet the 3 times we meet her- she has no clue who the doctor is or any sort of genuine understanding that the whole point of her existence then is to save the doctor. its more of a destiny thing than anything. why the hell does that change? 

Also- her costume was so not relevant. 

Also- the doctor is all totally in love with River- when hes only met her a handfull of times- and was only just becoming fond of her- when it took him 2 whole regenerations to fall propperly for Rose Tyler. Their whole story is still in the early stages for the doctor- but in the final stages for River. Its way more heartbreaking knowing that as river gets older- the doctor knows her less and less- and loves her less and less. He should love her fully when its River's first meeting of him- which was annoyingly in the Nazi Hitler episode. Which i thought was a mistake. 

Its just bloody annoying. 

they did such a better job with Amy/Roary/River, and with Donna, and with Rose. why did they eff up with this- when it had so much potential to be really really cool.

Suarez has done exactly the same for them this year - when you are the star of the club - the special talent - you really stand out.

The consistency argument is flawed - because the style of play last season has been changed, everyone has been knocking goals in.  The focus has not been on Drogba or the centre-forward.  It has been wonderful to watch at times, though also a somewhat flawed experiment.

Alternatively, it's because 8.5 fought in the time war and was only outside of the timelock for a short moment. In other words, most of his life is locked in the Time War. Only a small portion is outside of it, probably just before he regenerates into 9. 

Even more reason why I know it's 8.5 is because we'll get to see Paul McGann regenerate. And we know Eccleston doesn't want to be a part of it, which leaves only one solution.

Asking him to do that in 1 year is a tough task.  Where he is at when he's 22 or so will be a much better determination of his talent.

My own opinion: what I like most about Gerrard is his loyality. He really was one of the best and most complete players in the world and could have arguably chosen to join any other club to win the trophies he deserves. But he didn't. In a few years people will speak about such loyal players and the name Gerrard will be known to everybody. However, the names of Iniesta and Xavi will probably bear a lot more weight since they are also one-club-men and yet won a lot more than Gerrard. This, I think, will a very unfair assessment of the situation since nobody knows if Iniesta and Xavi would have stayed if they didn't win all these trophies. And actually the same goes for Gerrard (remember the transfer saga after Istanbul but you could also argue that he won us the Champions League) but Gerrard stayed and has carried the club amost singlehandedly through the arguably most difficult period in the clubs History (which Xavi and Iniesta didn't have to do). The club is now in safe hands again, has always been regarded as a major club to the world even though LiverpoolFC didn't manage to win the league for 23 years now, and the reason why the club is still popular is majorily down to Gerrard. It would be interesting to know how many kits with his name on the back have been sold in total, I think it is a huge huge number.

true,The_Darknut_Rises,smith,Smith,"Or if you really don't like Doctor Who you could always stop watching it. I'm not saying Moffat can do no wrong but he does create episodes of Doctor Who which people want to watch, which is what he's employed to do and is what any replacement for him will be expected to do also. I'm all for people voicing any genuine complaints they may have with the show to the relevant people but calling for a witch hunt against Moffat seems somewhat petty if not outright vindictive.

Quite apart from which most of the points in the petition simply fall apart if you take any time to think about them:

""The fundamental philosophy of the show has shifted."" - Well this statement is vague enough that you could really apply it to anything. Why have you given me a cheese sandwich? I had a ham sandwich yesterday. The fundamental philosophy of lunch has shifted.

""This was once a relatable, empathic, pacifistic character who was willing to sacrifice himself for ordinary people. Now, he is two-dimensional, detached, violent, and has even been seen committing premeditated murder for the sake of revenge."" - When has he been seen committing premeditated murder for the sake of revenge? Has he at any point in Moffat's tenure suggested he's no longer willing to sacrifice himself for ordinary people? Why does the petition complain about the way the character is changing and redefining himself and call for him to stay the way he's always been (at least as far as the writer of the petition is aware) but then also complain that the character is two-dimensional?

""The presentation of female characters on the show has raised serious concerns among feminists and women in general."" - if this concern is genuine (as neither a feminist or a woman I don't feel qualified to say if it is or isn't) then its an entirely separate and much bigger issue than putting it in the context of this petition makes it seem. Offensive and non-fanon aren't really comparable.

""Excessive liberties have been taken with the Doctor Who universe and its continuity, to the point of dramatically rewriting both Classic Who and the Russell T. Davies revival."" - Any continuity the Whoniverse had was brutally ripped up by RTD with the time war. Anyway the point of Who is that the cast can and do arrive in any given situation that best allows the writer to explore particular points, ideas or issues. Its what makes it arguably the perfect si-fi.

""The general quality of plots and character design has dropped significantly. Fans feel that the show's overarching plots, which are under Moffat's direction, are convoluted, poorly written, and presented in a hamfisted way. They also feel that the characters created under Moffat's watch are overly stereotyped, unrelatable, ""tropey"", and seriously lacking in both development and emotional depth. They are ""quirky"" and ""cool"" but wholly two-dimensional."" - Completely subjective. If you don't like it don't watch it. Bonus points for suggesting tropes are inherently bad. Also as a fan I don't appreciate being spoken for by someone I've never met. Certain fans feel this way, not all.

""There is a magic and a beauty about Doctor Who that has allowed it to exist for 50 years. It has one of the most dedicated fanbases in history, with many viewers who have watched it since childhood, including Steven Moffat himself. That magic and that beauty is not present in Steven Moffat's incarnation. The ""pop"" appeal of Moffat's Who has caused a bubble of interest, but it lacks those unique ingredients that have given Doctor Who its unprecedented longevity."" - Wrong. The ""pop"" appeal of any show is the reason people watch it and therefore the reason any show survives. Being a well loved program with a long history does not create some sort of loop hole via which they can keep churning out the same stories from 20 years ago and expect them to still be relevant just because they were the ones you happened to like watching every Saturday at Grannies house while eating chocolate biscuits when you were a child.

However with Johnson on the other side of defense who is fantastic going forward it is nice to have that balance on the other side of defense having someone whose strength is defending rather than attacking. 

In an ideal world, I would like to buy some strong competition for him this summer, not just a backup but someone who can come in and immediately challenge for his place in the team. This could help push Jose on to better performances or if necessary replace him.

true,Bongfu,null,Texas,"Well there are two sides to your question that needs to be answered. 

First off, Independence is something certain parties in Wales have always sought after. However, the last time there was any major discord was during the Middle Ages. Since then, there has always been a vocal minority seeking an independent Cymru. 

It is entirely unreasonable at this time for Wales to want independence from the UK. First would be the economic downfall from turning away from one of the world's strongest economies. The pound, even though its value has declined in recent years, is stronger than the EU or USD. Economically it does not make sense. 

Culturally, Wales has always endured. Our language is plastered on public signs next to their English translations. Welsh is taught in schools. Our history is preserved across the world, even here in Texas we have a Welsh Culture and History center. Though in the distant past, England persecuted the Welsh. In recent years however, not so much as the Irish or Scots. Again, no grounds for independence. 

We are a proud people, with a much richer and deep heritage than most on the island. That doesn't mean we should seek to stand on our own though. It means we should embrace all our legacy has to go on. That is, we are part of a greater whole. 

I do support the last part of your question. Nationalism is something Wales has always had in abundance. We are proud to call ourselves Welsh, the original Britons, and the islands true people. We are the voice of the earth, the wind through the valleys, and the spray of the salt on the cliffs. 

Nationalism has its limits however and be it misguided, it can lead people to act on it in the wrong way. Nationalism doesn't have to mean independence or revolution. It just means take pride in who you are and where you come from.

The game has changed so much from the time of the likes of Kenny and Rush and Beardsley etc. and overall, I just think the game of football is much harder today than it was back then. Now that is not to slight the achievements of those great men in the tiniest bit; it is more to say that in the modern game, the average player is just a better quality footballer. With advances in technology the tactics have become that much sharper, and the game that much faster. Basically, the game has evolved and just gotten that much better. The fact that Steven Gerrard stands out in this day and age as one of the world's finest footballers speaks volumes to just how good he is. There isn't team in the world that Gerrard wouldn't have walked right into the first 11 when he was 25-30 years old and even at present day that would probably remain the case after how good he was this year.

If Gerrard had left, say in '04 or '05 for Chelsea, or Madrid in '09 or '10, he would probably have every single trophy there is to be had in world football in duplicate numbers. ",0,1371135422,null,0,false,0,cai3zlb,t3_1g9o3z,t1_cai3zlb,t3_1g9o3z,null,1430823504,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

true,wp9000,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"I was merely answering your question, I actually thought linking to a pair of newspapers with massively differing politics would demonstrate the point that UKIP has members who has been associated with far right groups is fact, not a manufactured left-wing hysteria. 

So no, I wasn't linking to the Mail as an 'anti UKIP source', I was linking to it as it is a newspaper. The second link (Independent) also helps to prevent the knee-jerk dismissal of the DM's reporting. Saying that if you were a liberal you would dismiss the DM doesn't actually do anything to dispute what is clearly recorded in both articles; that some individual UKIP members have had association with groups such as the EDL and the BNP.

Also, I didn't say it was 'bad and wrong' to support a right wing party. I didn't make any judgement on the moral worth of left/right politics. I'm of the view that a great deal of right-wing politicians are guided by their morality. Again, not commenting on whether I agree with their morals, but at least they've got principles.

So no, I'm not going to indulge you with explaining why the political right are evil. Such a line of argument is simplistic and reductive at best.

What's your point about UAF? That they're heavily linked with the Labour party? Because to the best of my knowledge that isn't the case, therefore i is not comparable to UKIP's relationship (via individual members, I emphasis this again) with the EDL and BNP.

As for what it takes to be labelled a Fascist, I think the term is thrown around too lightly. I believe it's appropriate to emphasis the BNP's fascist leanings, but UKIP? No. They do associate with groups in the European Parliament that have some fairly startling views, but guilt by association isn't a very democratic way of approaching these things.

Returning to your original statement;
&gt;Why you link UKIP with far right thuggery, however tangentially

Because the 'far right thugs' (if you'll allow the paraphrase) make the case for voting for UKIP, Farage and co may not want the attention and association but Tommy Robinson is making sure the endorsement is clear.

The Good:

Physically one of the most impressive players on the team.  Every single game a ""larger"" player from the other team tries to push him off the ball and fails.  He simply doesn't get pushed off the ball.  Ever.  He doesn't get beaten by pace.  Ever.  Its awesome to watch opposing wingers try to do the ""self pass"" around him and fail.

Sometimes gets caught out of position, but recovers really well due to his pace.

He is able to support a younger, less experienced winger well when asked to.

Doesn't seem to foul very often.  I don't really have any stats to back this up, but I don't think of him as a player who relies on fouling very often.

Makes great overlapping runs.

The Bad:

Seems to get tunnel vision.  I am not sure if this is an issue with his vision in general: earlier in the season (and to some extent when he was playing poorly last season) he will lose the ball after dribbling to much with his head down.  Part of this, he seems to only look for Suarez in some situations.  I'm not sure if this started after the Newcastle goal, but that is when I started noticing it.

His crossing has been mentioned, I don't think he necessarily sucks at crossing, but he plays to many ""hollywood"" balls.  Obviously the goal a Newcastle was amazing, but he forces a lot of long balls trying to recreate it when we might have been better served by knocking it around a bit.

His shooting isn't very good.

Extremely left footed.

true,pambie,null,null,"I admit an interest here; having 3 relatives who are teachers who work ridiculously long hours after school to create lessons which are stimulating and include a multitude of activities and experiences. I also spent many years working with the young people leaving education and moving on to work, training or education.

In my experience many young people do not leave school with the skills of concentration and determination or the ability to apply themselves to what might be considered boring, unless they are lucky enough to move on to something which really interests them.

I wonder if in forcing teachers to make heroic efforts to try and keep a class engaged and on subject, the education system is not providing the students with the opportunity to pay attention, concentrate and learn that there will be consequences for inappropriate behaviour. I have seen far too many instances where school management have not backed good teachers trying to manage  classroom behaviour and being made an easy scapegoat for failing students.

I am not advocating a return to chalk and talk boring lessons. I am saying that teachers are blamed by inspectors, their own management and parents and that however skilled, they cannot force a child to participate, respect the right of others to learn or even to think. This is a whole society issue and endless reports and policies are not helping the situation. Particularly where they have a political agenda behind them and contradict each other.

The failure of the brightest is inextricably linked to the failure of those who are not the brightest in a comprehensive system, and if we are not to write off either group we have to find a way of teaching all children and aim for success and measures of success which are not only measured in exams.

As cars can go faster, lorries end up in groups together as they get overtaken and left behind by other traffic. So when they start filling 3/4 lanes on the M6 (happened in front of me a month ago) you have to speed up to over 70mph to get into the far right lane with all the big fast cars and get past the big group of them. All lorries are limited to about the same speed so they shouldn't need to overtake each other unless someone is driving super slow, but yet you see them try to overtake another lorry even though they are both going the maximum 52mph (I estimate they are going their max speed as I generally go 60mph according to my sat nav and I often have to slow down when one swings out into the middle lane).

[Here is a guide on how to turn it into a region-free player.](http://www.videohelp.com/dvdhacks/seiki-bd660/10959) Note that you can set DVD region to 0 (or ""all"") and you'll never have to touch it again, but Blu-Ray region can only be set to A, B, or C (US is A, UK is B), so you have to switch back and forth. Luckily, the *Who* Blu-Rays are not region-locked, so switching the BR region is not necessary.

This player is what I use to watch my *Who* DVDs - I've tested it on R2 classic *Who* DVDs, the Series 1-4 R2 DVD box set, and the Complete Specials Region B Blu-Ray set. All have played flawlessly on my US Samsung 1080p 60Hz TV.

QUICK GUIDE TO PLAYING REGION 2/B PAL CONTENT ON US TVS

For DVDs, you need to be sure that your player can handle region 2 discs, and can convert PAL to NTSC without the use of an external converter. The Seiki player can do this just fine. (US uses NTSC, which is 29.97 fps or 60i; UK uses PAL, which is 25fps or 50i. US TVs can't display 50i/25p content, so it needs to be converted.)

The *Who* Blu-Rays aren't region-locked, so the key there is finding a player that can convert high definition 50i content at 60p (or 60i) correctly. Luckily, the Seiki can do this as well. (Some Blu-Ray players that are region free still can't play 50i content on 60Hz TVs, so watch out for that.)",0,1371139136,null,0,false,0,cai5cwe,t3_1g9jp7,t1_cai5cwe,t1_cai2jlf,null,1430822786,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

I have watched maybe 6 games where he has played and he looked lazy and sluggish- only once did he really shine, and that was one of the last weeks of the season. He has looked good for moments in the U21, but we need to remember that it is against U21 players. 

Surely Chico would command a pretty decent price? He is a good, solid player and Swansea really don't need the money (actually making a profit) and can offer him Tin European football next season, which is more than us... It would be a nice buy, but I think we have to set out sights on bringing in our own Chico type player who is out of favour somewhere else so we can get him for cheap.

Not only De Bruyne, but Chelsea have just signed Schurrle, who will fit in the position of offering width that Chelsea were using Moses for. If we can get him I think he would be fantastic for us.

However, I also think Luiz has a lot to offer offensively. People say he's the natural replacement of Terry (or that's what he's supposed to be), but I more and more think he's a better replacement for Frank at that position. It's really hard to make up my mind and actually, I really don't care where he plays, because I know he's Chelsea quality. (He showed us that he improved a lot in comparison to last season.) I hope he stays at Chelsea and really becomes our new Captain. 


If he feels more comfortable to play CB in match X, I'd say let him. If he wants to play CDM in match Y, why not ? Versatile players are good for the team.

The club is too big to explain in one post, but you will pick it up just from lurking. Feel free to ask questions, I promise you everyone here loves to put themselves in the managers/chairmans/players shoes and answer questions.

Three names you should know:

&gt;AVB

Our head coach (read, manager). He has a large say in who comes in, complete say in what style of football spurs play (attacking!) and decides who plays when. 

His career started out as a teenager when he (as a fan of Porto) got in contact with the manager and challenged him on a few decisions. He provided very intelligent backings for his thoughts and was brought on at Porto. He was eventually picked up under the wing of Mourinho and worked with him as opposition scout at Porto, Chelsea and Inter. He left (angering Mourinho) Inter to take the top job at Porto. After 1 season he went undefeated and raised 3 trophies. Chelsea brought out his contract and he moved there 2 seasons ago with the job of moving on the old guard and bringing in new players.

He signed amazing players like Mata, Lukaku and Courtois (wish we had them) but lost the dressing room and was eventually sacked - his squad went on to win the CL. Spurs picked him up at the beginning of last season and he has since been amazing.

AVB has made his name as a student of the game, tactics is his thing and you will see in some games his decisions really turn the tide of things (sucked in City). His greatest success has come playing the 4-3-3 formation, which looks something like this:

Keeper (Fast, Smart)

RB (Fast) - LCB RCB (Smart) - LB (Fast)

CM (Passer) - CM (Destroyer) - CM (box to box / runner)

RW (Inverted) - ST (traditional) - LW (traditional)

The back line is 'high', which means they play high up the pitch and use communication and wit to catch offensive players off side. It also compresses the field when the opponent has the ball. It is susceptible to people kicking the ball over the defenders head, which is why you need quick fullbacks to track back.

When spurs are in possession they look something like.

Keeper

LCB - DM - RCB

RB - CM - CM - LB

RW - ST - LW

With the RB/LB moving up the pitch to provide offensive overlap and the DM dropping back to keep the back tight. The players moving up stick to the sidelines to provide width and open the field up (giving attacking players more room to move, the opposite of them playing high on defence to shrink the field for opponents). The inverted winger can act as a wide striker as this player will typically charge towards the goal with the intention of shooting. You will commonly see the LB/LW (or RB/RW) combining down the side to unleash a player down the line. 

It is currently transfer season, so spurs have some time to chop and change the squad. We are however not a financial powerhouse and so typically target either promising youth, unsettled/fringe class players or older experienced guys for cheap. AVB will likely look to use the same scouting brain that got him gold at Chelsea to bring in 2-3 players which will allow him to play in his favourite style next season. Speculation is that a striker, winger, CM and LB would be required, but spurs could get away with only signing 2-3 of those currently.

true,KnightDarkThe,null,null,"No offense, but bringing up trophies is hardly a good argument. Goals for Liverpool, Spain, etc. are long gone, my friend. Torres has steadily fallen off the map since the 2010 WC. Since then, he hasn't been, well, good. Not world class at all. 

Yes, he was the second highest goalscorer behind RVP in this chart. But to try to exclude all of the other stats is just ignorant. For instance, if you look at the second chart which factors in only the premier league, he was dead last compared to the other guys. Rotation? He played 32 out of 38 games, second only to RVP, with 26 of those being starts. His style of play involves more link-up play and all that? 5 assists, 4th out of 6, and barely 2nd last in pass completion % only in front of Dzeko.

Still not convinced. Let's take a look at the third table, which compared and contrasted these strikers through the minutes they played, also in the premier league. Let's see what we have here..rotation is an issue? Nah. Torres played 2540 minutes, second only to RVP. Difference is, RVP scored a goal every 123 minutes. Hell even Carlos Tevez, second last in minutes/goal, scored a goal every 199 minutes. Torres? 362. That's a goal every 362 minutes. That's a goal every (roughly) 4 games. 

I understand that the last two tables don't take into account all competitions, which I highly value, so let's revert to the first table. Once again, just like you said, let me reiterate that Torres was the 2nd highest leading goalscorer in this table, second only to RVP. Now that we got that over with, let's look at the goals per game ratio, which for some reason you seem want to disregard as useless. At the point of time that this article was written, Torres had played 57 games, with the next highest being RVP at 44. But wait, RVP scored at a 0.63 goals/game ratio. Torres? 0.35, in front of only Dzeko. But wait, rotation? Torres had 46 starts, 10 more than second-placed RVP, who had 36. How about we isolate games in which Torres only started? His ratio goes up to 0.43, but he finds himself dead last again.

Don't forget that these stats don't take into account anything of the sort when it comes to ""opponent difficulty."" Torres played a lot of ""lesser"" teams and scored against them, Brentford, Europa League compared to UCL, etc. 

I don't see how the whole Arsenal thing is even an argument. Good for him, I guess? I mean, Chelsea, City, and Tottenham were the only teams to beat United at Old Toilet, and Mata scored for us. Isolated games isn't a very helpful or meaningful argument.

When it comes to expectations, 20 goals is hardly a bad haul. In fact, it's a pretty decent haul. If he had played around 40-45 games, that is. World Class Strikers should be doing much more than 22 goals in 64 games. World Class strikers don't need excuses about confidence, slow players, people not wanting to pass to them, etc to continue terrorizing defenses. The fact is Torres is not world class, and with him and his dreadful inconsistency such as those long goal drougghts leading the line Chelsea shouldn't expect to win the Premier League or UCL.

We just finished the Premier League season with 72 points, the highest the club has ever gotten, but due to an unfortunate series of events, we finished in 5th place, just one point behind (our greatest rivals) Arsenal, meaning we won't qualify for the Champions League next season, and will be competing in the Europa League with other PL clubs Swansea &amp; Wigan. 

Now, our star player is 23 year old attacking midfielder Gareth Bale. He is very, very good. Since we did not qualify for the champions league, there has been mass speculation that Bale will leave Tottenham for another club (Real Madrid seems to be the main contender), but we are optimistic that Bale will stay for a few reasons:
1. His love for our manager, Andre Villas-Boas (AVB)
2. His down-to-earth personality. We don't think money will be as important to him as something like team dynamic, which in my honest opinion, Tottenham has one of the strongest.

So, the summer transfer window closes in August, and we very much hope that Bale will stay with us for the upcoming season.

Aside from Bale, we are quite lacking in the striker department, and we're aiming to sign at least one good striker this summer, whether it be David Villa from Barca or Christian Benteke from Aston Villa, a striker is something we'll definitely need to succeed next season.

Another thing I can think of: we love Andre Villas-Boas, and we absolutely do not want him to leave. But he's been linked with moving to other clubs, like Paris St. Germain (PSG). We don't think this will happen this season however, since AVB has stated numerous times that he loves Tottenham, and wants to make the squad stronger next season. Now, some of our rivals Chelsea, ManCity, and Man United all will have new managers next season, so we're hopeful that keeping AVB will be key in securing a top-4 finish, as managerial stability is extremely important.

For me the best couples at CB for this season (and again, this is just purely based on my personal opinion as I'm not a football expert at all) were Terry-Cahill and Ivanovic-Cahill (last couple was played a few times). I prefer Cahill over Luiz at CB, because I think he is better at that certain position. (and I know Luiz is a LCB, but at this moment I just can't fully trust him there yet). 


Do you remember the game where Luiz-Cahill (I think) were playing together and Cahill had to constantly make up for Luiz mistakes. It was in the second part of the season this year. And that is one of the reasons I think Luiz should not be playing CB atm.


I have to disagree with you on his horrible positioning though. I think he does a great job on that aspect, but his trackbacking is really bad at some times.

Bale is amazing and will probably stay for another season.

Our manager makes men question their sexuality on a daily basis.

Our defensive line is strong with a very deep bench of good CBs, our underperforming LB Benny Assou-Ekkotoe (?) may or may not be sold, but apparently was playing on injury all season. We're getting our young LB back from loan who wants play time. Overall LB is weakest position in defense.

Midfield is congested with talent. Best - Sandro (gone for most of last season on injury), Dembele. Holtby a young recent transfer that hasn't established himself yet but shows promise. Siggurdson - doesn't have a consistent spot atm. We're getting Townsend back from QPR to potentially be our left winger.

Dempsey is only good sometimes.

Recent transfer Hugo Lloris took over as first pick for GK. Brad is still good, but is usually seen sleeping in a rocking chair at the stadium. When he's not sleeping, he's telling the bench how back in his day he used to play in 8 feet of snow.

Everyone is pretending to dismiss transfer news about Bale (because he loves us), as well as about strikers - mostly because we're linked with every single striker that hasn't knocked down a geostationary satellite from a penalty after running at it like a broken moose.

Don't even look up who Damiao is, it's not gonna happen.

Ever seen the show 24? It's a good indication of how our transfers happen. We're not safe from selling Bale until a day after the window closes. And we're probably getting a stiker. Maybe. With 2 seconds left of the window. And we're probably also picking up 4 more midfielders, preferably Belgian. 

Invest in heartburn and blood pressure medication, we don't win like normal people and wait until late second half for Bale to levitate the ball around the entire team and into the goal with only his mind, and then run around the stadium making a really stupid looking heart gesture.

true,layendecker,crest-new,OLD CREST 4EVA,"I think you are about right with the Fer valuation- if he was historically injury free then 8.5m will be fair, but because of his knee troubles we have to knock a bit off that. If we got him for between 6-7 I would be pretty happy, presuming he can pick up his performance levels to where he was (supposedly, I didn't take notie of him before the real rumours came up) before Xmas. 

Vlaar is kind of another Chico, but in a way worse situation. He is a talented guy, plucked out of a smaller European league and has hit the ground running in the PL- because of this you can at least double the price they paid for him (sub €5m I think).

This whole thing presents an interesting conundrum. A lot of people are saying 'we should get a few younger guys from [insert smaller European League] and we are golden', yet these are the same people who seem to consider Everton to be the sort of side that should be (and will be) gunning for top 4 places.

The risk here is huge, and people don't realise that because of the low transfer fee reported in the papers and will say 'what is a £2m flop if we have the potential to dig up a Michu"". 

Well, the truth is that a £2m transfer fee is a hell of a lot more than a £2m flop once you pay his wages for 3 years (£5.5m), his agent fee (at least £500k, possibly in the millions), any signing on bonuses (maybe 500k) and any other fees... You are looking close to £10m for this player who is going to go out on a free after doing nothing productive for the team.

We can possible sum this up by saying 'For every Michu there is a Boselli""- let us all hope and prey that Martinez got that out of his system before coming to us!

---

Regarding Moses and Ba for Fellaini, it is probably a fair trade, but considering how overvalued Fellaini is at the moment we can get an awful lot more out of Chelsea I feel.

&gt;If we can also get McCarthy and a cheap out of favour defender (like you said) I think we'd be set!

I honestly think we need a lot more, I hope we sign 3-4 depth players on the cheap who can come in and do a job if needed but are happy to warm the bench most weeks-  but I would like to see us spend a bit of money on a CB- maybe someone like Vlaar, who is proven but we can tempt (I have been a huge fan of Grant Hanley for a few years, but he just signed a new deal so that is probably a no go), in addition to another fringe starter who is out of favour/ cheaper and a similar mix for centre mids (Fer and McCarthy would probably do fine if that prick Whelan doesn't break our balls).

true,SuperLuka,num30,Sandro,"In short form, everything you need to know as a new Yiddo, in handy bullet points!

*AVB is our boy genius manager, won a treble with Porto including the distinctions of 1) going undefeated in the league all season and 2) being the youngest manager to ever win a European trophy. Much maligned in the last couple of years due to an unfortunate spell at Chelsea, who I'll talk about more a bit later. Now successfully rebuilding his reputation with old Spurs.

*Daniel Levy is our hard nosed chairman who sacked our former manager Harry Redknapp for speaking out of turn (and entirely too often). Levy is famous for driving a hard bargain, maybe the hardest in all of football! Harry Redknapp was our previous wheeling, dealing cockney geezer of a manager, who did four great years at Spurs including some glory glory nights and getting to the quarter finals of the UCL in our first try. Sadly no longer with us. Huge mixed opinion about Redknapp among Spurs fans, take note!

*Gary B is our star player, former left-back turned winger now trying his hand at playing in the middle, the young Welsh lad scores when he wants from where he wants and can also run very very fast. Gary B is currently wanted by just about every club in the world and reports indicate when he leaves, if he leaves, he'll do so as the most expensive player of all time.

*Other top lads and fast runners include eternal wonderboy Aaron Lennon, super quick but inexperienced fullback Kyle Walker, the monster Sandro in defensive midfield (who is kept in a cage when not playing football), his understudy Scott Parker, who is also one of our main men and total captain material when avaliable. In defense we have the masterful Vertonghen, next year he'll be pairing with Big Kaboul (been out injured for a long time) or Michael Dawson, another fantastic lad who generally captains the squad when on the field. Lots more I haven't mentioned, including fan favourite scores-but-doesn't-do-a-lot-else Jermain Defoe, the much maligned (but incredibly gifted and loaded) Manu Adebayor, Icelandic fish merchant Gylfi Siggurdson, and the gritty all-American hero Clint Dempsey, who like Ade is much maligned but also scored some of our most important goals last season.

*Our biggest rivals are those bastard scum bags Arsenal, also called The Gooners, who aren't originally from North London and moved up in our space like the leechy shithead cunts they are some hundred years ago, and are now in the habit of finishing one point ahead of us every single season. Also Chelsea FC, some would say even bigger cunts, but not our local rivals. Chelsea are run by a Russian trillionaire who throws his money away on world-class players and in many respects is the Anti-Levy. Recent reasons to hate Chelsea include them winning the UCL (thus expelling us from the competition, despite qualifying in 4th that year), celebrating goals that aren't goals in the FA Cup semi-final, having two goals that were a) offside, b) never crossed the line the year before, and also generally being shitty bastard scumbag mugs.

*As a London team you are also expected (but not required) to dislike West Ham United, another local rival but we don't really give a shit about them because they're constantly bouncing in and out of the championship. The rivalry here is a little one-sided, Spurs are sort of regarded as the biggest 'scalp' in the EPL WHU can realistically play ball with, so the West Ham fans bloody love that fixture, and we enjoy it too. 2-3 WHU V Tottenham @ Upton Park was probably the game of the season last year. Other London clubs to watch out for include QPR who we hate because their fans are scummy bastards (even though they're managed by the Red Napkin), and Fulham who you don't have to hate because no one gives a shit about Fulham.


*Right now our primary objective from season to season is to qualify for the Champions League so we can have some glory glory nights again. You qualify for the UCL by finishing in the top four, unless a team that finishes outside of the top four lifts the trophy, which can happen in freak instances. Unfortunately we are it seems cursed to miss out by the slighest of margins over and over again. Our secondary objective, and I would say much more important, is to continue to grow and develop and improve as a team, as a squad, and importantly as a Club, regardless of UCL qualification, which means next year we want to beat our points tally from this season in the EPL, if nothing else. Next year we'll be competing in the Europa League, which certainly has its charms and produced more than a few heart in mouth moments this last season, thanks to our enthused participation under AVB.",0,1371142239,null,0,1371142707,0,cai6kz7,t3_1g9wsz,t1_cai6kz7,t3_1g9wsz,null,1430822210,10,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,10

You have dumbfounded me with stats and  have shown your ignorance by avoiding all empirical analysis.  

Stats are useful but they are only part of the story.

If you think that Brentford away, a London derby in the oldest football competition on this planet is a ""lesser"" game then I really think we need to end the conversation here before I lose the will to live.

Arsenal finished 4th, they are our biggest London rival (though Tottenham are more hated) and again, it is empirical evidence which has to be used as a compliment to the stats, which only show part of the picture and what is happening on the pitch.

That Mata scored at Old Trafford is exactly the point.  Look at Chelsea's scorers this season.  Everyone is having a pop including Cahill and Ivanovic.

true,lommym,num11,,"Probable senior squad for next year (assuming no transfers happen): 

Forwards: **Adebayor**, **Defoe**

Mids: **Gylfi 'Siggy' Sigurðsson** (AM, generally played on the left), **Lewis Holtby** (AM, didn't play a lot... but he was played centrally and out left), **Aaron Lennon** (RW, had a great year before his injury... really excelled under AVB and was probably a bigger factor than Bale BEFORE his injury, then Bale's form really really picked up), **Gareth Bale** (AM, center, not really a left wing anymore... but he def. could play it), **Clint Dempsey** (AM, and leftish... American Frank Lampard? Not that he's as good as fat Frank... but there are some similarities in play style), **Moussa Dembélé** (CM, can tackle, can hold the ball, can pass, generally speaking is a bear... played out right sometimes for Lennon's absence), **Sandro** (DM, similar to Moussa but more defensive and less flair... this is overly simplistic, young, great, and getting better), **Tom Huddlestone** (CM, think of a large ocean tanker with a missile pod on top... slow, but can hit a pass pretty damn well), **Lil' Tommy Carroll** (CM, pretty good passer and seems comfortable on the ball for a U21... One of my personal favorites and could well fit into the squad in a few years... He has the feel of Luka, without the baggage), **Andros Townsend** (Inverted RW, youngster loaned out to QPR for the latter half of last season... played well there and played well under 'Arry when he had the few shouts he did... inverted: he is left footed, but generally played on the right allowing him to shoot on his left, see: Bale a lot this year)

Defenders: **Benoît Assou-Ekotto** (LB, decent attacking left back... I feel his last two years for him he saw major improvements... before that I was skeptical, and his form seemed to dip... probably due to his injury), **Steven Caulker** (CB, youngster, good passer... still needs to develop more but handled first-teaming for Swansea pretty well), **Younes Kaboul** (CB, another one of my favorites... Powerful, quick, great header... he was great before his injury and hopefully will come back in similar form), **Michael Dawson** (CB, he loves Spurs... not that quick, can dive into tackles if he is left out alone, good at clearing... for me, third choice behind Kaboul and Vertonghen... Caulker closing in), **Jan Vertonghen** (CB, had an excellent first season... his heart seems in it, great ball control and tackling... can get caught out on his attacking runs - not often - but all-in-all an excellent CB), **Kyle Walker** (RB, young and physically impressive... Fast as hell, which helps him when he is out of position... reminds me of a puppy still, runs fuckin' hard, but still has some things to learn), **Kyle Naughton** (RB, can play LB but he is right-footed... young... can do a job)

Keepers: **Hugo Lloris** (Handsome, a wee bit short for a goalie, agile, punches, acrobatic... honestly, one of the best keepers in the world but he definitely needs more time with the team), **Brad Friedel** (American school of goalkeeping, old, good)

Manager: Andre Villas-Boas (Railed by many for his time at Chelsea, that was probably part his fault, part the fault of the assholes at Chelsea, but a solid, organized manager who is as bright as he is handsome.. We want to keep him.

Luiz is the better defender that Cahill, period. Cahill is a great defender, there's no doubting that, but you don't need to be an expert to see which one is superior.

Nope I don't remember that game, and seemingly you're not even too certain who was partnering him that time. The fact that you've counted a match which you can hardly recall as one of your reasons really discredits your argument.

That's the problem - his horrible positioning and tracking are not two separate entities, they are entirely connected as they both affect each other.

""It is better to fail aiming high than to succeed aiming low. And we of Spurs have set our sights very high... so high, in fact, that even failure will have in it an echo of glory."" -Bill Nicholson

Spurs are about glorious, swashbuckling attacking football, they're about playing the game in the right way and that means both approaching games constructively as oppose to destructively and not being dirty, if you like. 

We're renowned for being exciting for neutrals, for Spurs fans themselves the club is different to that though. The excitement while watching matches is gone, instead it's a horribly addictive and unshakable kind of stress, the kind of stress that you look forward to having each week and that gives that feeling in your stomach. 

Another thing you should know; we were awful in the 90's, pretty shit in the early 00's and have been slowly but surely improving since then. With a state of the art training ground built and planning permission for a new stadium granted (?) the club is certainly going places and securing its position as a top 6 Premier League club.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Your daughter has great taste.  Here’s a primer.

The newer series started in 2005 and has had seven seasons.  The Doctor has been played by three actors.  New actors are brought in by the Doctor “regenerating”, involving a change in appearance and personality – these actors portrayed the Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Doctors.  (Until now, these actors didn’t interact – one followed the other, as an actor left the series.)

This is the television series’ fiftieth anniversary, so there is a lot of celebratory activity amongst the fandom this year.  

The reason there has been a lot of activity in the fandom lately is pretty much threefold.

First, the seventh season ended by – and at this point I’m presuming you don’t care about spoilers – ended with the introduction of a previously unknown regeneration of the Doctor from his past.  Moreover, this character is not a “Doctor” – he did something that made his other “selves” reject and hide him.  This is all quite juicy and interesting.  He is being portrayed by John Hurt, who you may have seen as the character in “Alien” who was the first victim of the Alien (he had it burst from his chest).

Second, the next episode – the 50th Anniversary Special, which should air on November 23 – will feature the return of the Tenth Doctor and of his companion, Rose.  These were favorite characters and many of us are excited to see them again in a new, official episode.  Further, this is one of the first times in the new series that one of the Doctor’s selves will interact with another.  (There was a brief little bit involving one of the selves from the earlier series, but that didn’t air on the series itself.)

Third, and by no means least, we very recently were told that Matt Smith – the actor portraying the Eleventh Doctor – is leaving the show after the Christmas special.  This means we’ll have a new regeneration of the Doctor, and a new actor portraying the character.  There’s some speculation or wonder as to whether the BBC will finally break the racial or gender barriers for the Doctor, as previously, he’s always been portrayed by a white male.

This means that in the two episodes we’re going to have this year (the 50th Anniversary Special and the Christmas Special), we’re going to have a lot of momentous events: we’ll learn more about this hidden regeneration, we’ll see the Tenth Doctor and Rose again, and we’ll meet the new Doctor.

These are all rather significant, large things for fans of the series, but we are not getting much official news on these issues, as the BBC is of course safeguarding its secrets.

So in the absence of official news, there’s a lot of speculation and talk and excitement, to fill the silence.",0,1371153983,null,0,false,0,caibei0,t3_1g8bdc,t1_caibei0,t3_1g8bdc,null,1430819938,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,roontish12,dalek,Dalek,"The show was rebooted in 2005, starting with Christopher Eccleston playing the doctor for one season. His companion, Rose Tyler is played by Billie Piper. At the end of the first season the doctor regenerates and is then played by David Tennent (a fan favorite). Billie Piper stayed on as the companion for this doctor for another season. The 3rd season, Rose and the doctor are separated, and the new companion is  Freema Agyeman who plays Martha Jones. The fourth season, the new companion is Donna Noble, played by Catherine Tate. At the end of the fourth season is a rather big event, with Rose Tyler, Martha Jones and some other recurring characters returning for the finale (including Sarah Jane Smith, played by Elisabeth Sladen, who was companion to Tom Baker, the original series 4th doctor, the one with the long rainbow scarf). 

After that, there are  of three or four ""specials"" (about 90 minutes each, not quite movies, but more than episodes) leading up the end of David Tennent's run. The returning enemy in the last two specials is The Master, a timelord and old foe of the doctor from the original series, now played by John Simm. At the end of the 2nd part, the doctor regenerates once again, and David Tennent is replaced by Matt Smith. 

Matt Smith teams up with Amy Pond and Rory Williams (Amy's boyfriend/husband). And later on in the season River Song, who is first seen in a two parter during Tennents run. River Song is the doctors wife, and there is lots of time travel play involved in that they never meet in quite the right order. Amy Rory and River are the doctors companions for seasons 5 and 6 and for the first half of season 7. Beginning of season 7 we are introduced to Claira Oswald, who is a very mysterious character that the doctor sees dying a number of times (She's the impossible girl). As well as some, semi-companion characters, including Lady Vastra who is a lizard person, Jenny, her wife, and Strax, a Sontaran, who is indebted to the doctor. At the end of season 7, which just aired not that long ago, we discover that somehow, nobody knows for sure yet, but one of the doctors regenerations, or the original, or something, will be played by John Hurt. Later this year will air the Dr Who 50th Anniversary special (And we will supposedly find out more about who John Hurt is). Some of the storyline towards the end of the 7th season, without spoiling too much, ends up entangling Clara with some of the old Classic Who doctors. And some predict this will come into play with the Anniversary special. It's confirmed that Matt Smith and David Tennent will both be featured in the 50th. After that, a Christmas special, as there is every year, which will most likely be the end of Matt Smith's run, and we will be introduced to a new Doctor.

Of course strays are going to hunt more, they don't have a human servant to open tins and they are free to breed and make more strays. I think it's unfair to tarnish pet cats with the same brush as strays. I think a lot of pet cat owners would say they cats are purely opportunistic hunters rather than active hunters...a full belly of Whiskers or Felix won't eliminate the instinct to hunt but it sure reduces the motivation to hunt.

As a cat owner I am responsible for keeping my furry bastards fed and making sure they are spayed and neutered to help prevent unnecessary strays. I can't account for every stray's activity and that's a whole different kettle of fish anyway. I grew up in a household of cats and a bird box nailed to the side of the house, and *every year* bluetits would nest. If the cat predation was that bad they would have wiped out that bluetit family many years ago.

true,hdah24,flair7,,"**Some important history:**

* We were founded in 1882, making us 130 years old and one of the oldest clubs in the Premier League

* In 1901 we won the FA Cup, making us the *only* non-league club (i.e. such a small club we weren't even in the lowest league) ever to win it 

* Our latin motto is *Audere est Facere*, which means 'To Dare Is To Do'. This is displayed [around our stadium](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3503/3178940635_2c2f66c861.jpg)

* Our emblem, the cockerel on the football, is homage to our founder, Harry Percy (or Harry Hotspur), who enjoyed cock-fighting

* The lions on our [older emblems](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0c/Tottenham_Hotspur_crest.png) also pay homage to Harry Hotspur, who was a member of the noble Northumberland family. The Northumberland family (think Game of Thrones) had the red lion as their emblem.

* Our stadium, [White Hart Lane](http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/04_03/WhiteHartLaneES_468x316.jpg) was built in 1899 but due to our growing fanbase (there are more people the *waiting list* for season tickets than there are seats in our stadium) and the fact its so old and outdated, we are currently building a new stadium nextdoor to replace it: the [Northumberland Development Project](http://www.london24.com/polopoly_fs/nls_wk50_11_spurs_stadium_ndp_1_1153436!image/4272634502.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_630/4272634502.jpg). 

* Overall, we have won the FA cup 8 times, the Football League 2 times, the UEFA Cup (now the Europa League) 2 times, the League Cup 4 times, and the FA Charity Shield 7 times

* Our ['glory years'](https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSnbi2rP1eLLHV_HWHcNroiyy-AdQwoRy4DBNuhgDpTgP15O75AkQ) were in the 1960s, when we became the first team to complete the double (winning the league and FA cup in the same season) in the 20th century

* In the last few decades we have been in a slump, but 3 years ago we started a transformation and now are on of the top teams in England. We aim to get back in the Champions League and bring back the 'glory years'

* The following people are considered legends in our history, but there are many many more to add on to this list: 
&gt; * [Bill Nicholson](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/02/27/article-1157188-03B0C3E1000005DC-91_468x331.jpg) - often you will hear Spurs fans refer to Tottenham as 'the club that Bill made'. He was the manager of Spurs during the glory years, and is hailed as the father of the club as we know it today.
&gt; * [Dave Mackay](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pWwj9U1x0nk/TbmVrcpQQPI/AAAAAAAAAcw/WBgSJNIihlU/s1600/derby_county_kits_gallery_68_69_470x300.jpg) - part of the 1961 Double-winning squad
&gt; * [Danny Blanchflower](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/10/28/article-1223130-007A49B900000258-81_468x457.jpg) - same as above. One of the best Spurs players of all time.
&gt; * [Gary Mabbutt](http://www.virginmedia.com/images/mabbutt-280.jpg) - made 619 appearances for Spurs, and was captain from 1987 to 1998
&gt; * [Paul 'Gazza' Gascoigne](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2011/4/15/1302864135579/Paul-Gascoigne-celebrates-007.jpg) - not just a Spurs legend, but an English hero with, unfortunately, a very sad story of alcoholism
&gt; * [Steve Perryman](http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/40707000/jpg/_40707111_perryman270.jpg) - holds the appearance record for Spurs with 854 games between 1969 and 1986
&gt; * [Jimmy Greaves](http://www.a1sportingmemorabilia.co.uk/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/5e06319eda06f020e43594a9c230972d/j/i/jimmy-greaves-signed-canvas-fa-cup.jpg) - holds the club goalscoring record with 266 goals
&gt; * [David Ginola](http://www.whoateallthepies.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/david_ginola240.jpg) - Was named Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footabller of the Year whilst playing for Spurs, making him the first player in English history to do so with a club outside the top 4
&gt; * [Pat Jennings](http://rogavi.co.uk/assets/prizes/0/1238-w400.jpg) - One of the best Goalkeepers ever to put on a Spurs shirt. Interestingly not just a Spurs hero, but also somewhat of an Arsenal hero, as he played for both cubs.
&gt; * [Gary Lineker](http://www.sportsignings.com/images/products/products/TOTTENHAM/Image12.jpg) - Now a TV personality and host of Match of The Day, Lineker was a Spurs stirker from 1998 to 1992. He is known for having never even been cautioned in his entire 16 year career.
&gt; * [Ledley 'The King' King](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club%20Home/2009/3/23/1237791489055/Ledley-King-001.jpg) - one-club-man who was Spurs captain from 1999 until last year, when he sadly retired after injury problems. Bar his injuries, he is considered one of the best English defenders of all time and is respected universally. Just watch [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUfjPtPMA7Y).
&gt; * [Michael 'Daws' Dawson](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01825/michael-dawson_1825731c.jpg) - current club captain and top fucking lad. Often nicknamed 'Mr. Hotspur' due to his sheer devotion to the club
