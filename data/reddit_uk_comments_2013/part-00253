Personally, I never saw him as anything more than a Tim Cahill tribute act, only with more complaining every time he got tackled.

I'd be disappointed to see us bring in a one-note player like him, even if that note is the tune of a few goals from midfield.

I'd be surprised if Jela went in the January, especially with Kone being out for as long as reported, and don't expect much more than Heitinga to go.",0,1385407980,null,0,false,0,cdms6kt,t3_1rfi8j,t1_cdms6kt,t3_1rfi8j,null,1428512065,0,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,0

true,[deleted],null,null,"Something I'd like to add to that, the double box-to-box system is not typical for a 4-3-3. It is how Jose implemented it in his first tenure with us, but the normal style is 6-8-10, that is a holding player, a box-to-box man, and a #10.

That is also how we played against West Ham, with Mikel, Lampard, and Oscar in the 6, 8, and 10, respectively.

What you said about Hazard was totally right though, because in the 4-3-3, the defensive shape really is 4-3-3, with a bank of 3 in front of the back four. The wingers might track their fullback, but really 7 men is fine to defend with.

The 4-2-3-1 on the other hand tends to defend in a 4-4-1-1 shape. The 10 stays high and the wide men drop deep.

Basically this means that defensive responsibility is shifted from the outside to the middle.

It's not obvious to say which is better for us. Last year I would have said definitely 4-2-3-1, but we now have more guys that can play effectively as wingers (mostly Schurrle &amp; Willian), so I think our best shape might be a 4-3-3 to get the best out of our central midfielders.

Also, and this is a bit unlikely, I would be interested to see Oscar play as our 8 with Mata as the 10. I really think Oscar could be a great 8, but who knows.

There is a reason that rape is defined so specifically. Section 2 (assault by penetration) and Section 4 (Causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent) cover just about everything that would be commonly considered to 'rape' (i.e. a non consensual sexual act), however under either of these sections there is a requirement to prove that the act has a sexual element.

true,Kiprazz,silence,Silence,"According to that theory, information wouldn't be much different. I mean, just like an object can degrade by losing atoms over time, information can also degrade via forgetting. If the loop would actually go on forever, one time (and I'm again will be using ""Time Crash"" as an example) the tenth Doctor would forget one lever that the fifth saw the tenth do. If that happened everything would crash. Yes I know ""how hard is it to remember a few levers, which you've seen and operated for about 800 years of your life"". But this is just on a big scale. I mean you could forget just a little tiny bit of information and it wouldn't be the same. Iterate for an infinite number of times, and basically the whole information's gone.

Now, what I'm suggesting is that there is no loop. I mean one point in space and time happens only once. And with the fez there were three points colliding at the same time - Hurt's, Smith's and Tennant's. Meaning, even if the fez degraded a little bit (and a number of atoms definetely fell off of it while it was travelling through the tear), it wouldn't have time to fully disintegrate, because it happened only three times. Smith threw the fez to Tennant, then to Hurt, who then gave it to, maybe, Elizabeth, who put it in a museum for Smith. That's it. It might seem like an infinite loop, and it would definitely be, if computed on a computer, but in my mind, there is no loop.

The Bulgarians are very welcome here. I have worked with them many times and I know they are good honest people. The problem is that when the doors open, we are expecting a major rush of Gypsies also. this is very bad. Something we have never seen before.



The good people of Bulgaria are a completely different ball game to Roma Gyspies.

the gypsies teach they're children's proverbs.

When Jesus was nailed to the cross he had a gold nail in his heart preventing him from going to heaven.
however the gypsie child removed this cross and Jesus was released into paradise.. and God said. from now on, all Roma peoples are allowed to steal without facing the wrath of god.
this is what they actually teach to their children!

*Risking* killing innocents is not very much better than doing it deliberately. I bring this up not to defend them but to illustrate, in agreement with /u/Yurilovescats, that this is not the work of the 'regular' Provisional IRA - they gave warnings when they were attacking 'non-legitimate' targets. They feared the killing of innocent people would wear away any support (or indeed, indifference) from moderates - *which is exactly what happened*. Horrific as it was, the atrocity at Omagh ensured any strong 'splintering' of the IRA after its GFA-based ceasefire was stillborn; nobody wanted to be associated with the likes of the 'Real' IRA.

Accept it - variety of thought and belief is a good thing, and if you disagree, you might be wiser and sound less adolescent if you don't call for the abolishment of systems of belief. I don't agree with religious creeds, but I don't hate them and blame them for all the problems - because human beings caused all the problems, and getting rid of a thought-process will not get rid of the problematical nature of human beings.

Humans fuck other humans up, and then find reasons for themselves to be right. The USSR was anti-religion, and as corrupt and vicious as you can get. That's why a lot of older people are so alarmed at the totalitarian bent that is so enthused and feels so morally pure about disposing of religion.

Now that the Doctor's been through this period of dealing with the destruction of Gallifrey, there is a chance he could bring it back.  How is he going to find it? Will he try to rebuild Gallifrey in the aftermath of the war? Will we find out more about the Doctor's past, why he ran away in the first place?

In the old series the ultimate timelord solution was to place your enemy is an endless loop, since you are just doing the same things over and over, once you make one loop and all your decision and didn't get out you are stuck forever.

So here we are saying that they are time locked so that they can't time travel.  The end of time still doesn't make sense. Why would the council need to escape the time lock at all. why not use the ultimate saction in their own time stream.  Lets say the time lock prevents that because the ultimate sanction is ending time and a form of time travel.  

I still have trouble since the doctor admits to timelocking the war, but prior to now never really admits or alludes to complete geocide. 

I guess the consensus is the doctor first time locks the war, not sure when or how the doctor manages this. At the end of the war realizing its hopeless kills everyone.  In day of the doctor manages to not kill everyone.  Is that basically it?

true,Frosstbyte,null,null,"&gt;Time Travel makes for a hell of a retcon device, and when used and explained correctly, doesn't even come across as a Retcon. Which if you paid attention, Moffat did swimmingly.

Except for all of the bazillion times that the show has explicitly told us that you can't change history.  Except that the difference between ""changing history"" and ""conveniently forgetting that's what you did in the first place because reasons"" is so manufactured and semantic in the context of this show that it strains credulity.  The 50th wants you to simultaneously accept 1) the Doctor always chose to save Gallifrey because the children and so the War Doctor never made the bad choice, but 2) Nine and Ten don't remember what the War Doctor really did, so they're still consumed with the guilt and loneliness of believing that they committed genocide against their own kind *and* 3) Eleven (with the help of the Moment and Clara) somehow still gets to make the right choice to close the Doctor's redemptive arc.  The episode suggests that the only impact of changing history (and not some little thing like stepping on an ant, but literally saving an entire planet) is that your past selves become ""unsync'd"" and forget what you did in the future to change the past.  

I'm not saying that saving Gallifrey wasn't morally right compared to not saving Gallifrey, and I understand the logic behind wanting to save Gallifrey.  I'm saying that changing (yes, he changed it, it's a retcon, deal with it) everything about what happend to Gallifrey is a very significant shift in the rules of changing history in this show (i.e. it's ok to change history if you do so in a way that makes the people who witnessed it think you didn't).  It also cheapens Nine's and Ten's guilt, because it essentially means that they spent hundreds of years feeling guilty about something that didn't happen.  That's a cheap trick, just like the finale to Dallas, which is the only part of that article that makes any sense.  It cheats the audience of their emotional investment in what happened, by making it not actually happen.  That's a very dangerous narrative tool to use, and, as I said in my last post, we will have to wait until 12's adventures to see whether Moffat's gamble pays off.  The search for and finding of Gallifrey could be an amazingly rewarding story that completely justifies that handwaving and nonsense of rewriting the premise of nuWho.  It could also be incomprehensible garbage that whoever is the showrunner after Moffat will spend his or her entire tenure attempting to fix.

1) Galifrey is a MASSIVE planet, and it merely being in the solar system would cause natural devastation on earth
2) The Time lords, particularly Rassillion's faction, are a bit desperate and crazy.  The Day of the Doctor seems to sort of rewrite this to a degree, saying that not every Time Lord was like that, but several people have complained about this.
3) Once Galifrey was free of the time lock, the time lock itself would be broken.

You're right. When RTD decided he was going to destroy Gallifrey there *probably* wasn't much hope of getting it back.

""This is supposed to be time-locked, we're not supposed to be here"" and Dalek Caan getting through the Time Lock... it makes a lot more sense now, because there never WAS a Time Lock. Not only did Moffat clean up his own continuity, he cleaned up some of RTD's as well.

true,ReportPhotographer,cnty-uk,UK based journo,"There is outrage over the Italian incident. But the incident in question is difficult to assess, particularly as the facts of what actually happened are disputed by both sides.

Considering how sensitive diplomatic relations are with East Africa and South Asia, I confidently believe that any right-minded maritime security firm would drill to the point of branding into its employees the rules of engagement when it comes to potential assaults in open water. Notably that they are required to fire warning shots near, not directly at the on coming threat, and only fire directly when all other attempts at dissuasion are proved futile.

That being said, I wouldn't want to make that decision.  I'm sure you wouldn't want to either.  Neither of us were there, and we can only speculate and take what is being said by either side and see what comes of it. But I suggest that it best to refrain from making immediate assumptions.

Also, comparison by analogy, does not make for a logically sound argument. You cannot compare a company like Blackwater, which is entrenched with the CIA undertaking US Government-backed and led contracts all over the world, with a maritime security company which provides security for cargo ships only in hostile waters in the most dangerous shipping lanes in the world. 

I see you did some research, and I am pleased to inform you that I am very well versed in what a 'Private Military Contractor' is, having dealt with them personally in Ivory Coast, Congo, Lebanon, Liberia and Cameroon. They were not good people, and for most of them, questionably unstable functioning alcoholics with egos larger than Ron Jeremy's shlong.

My stance? Well I certainly do not think anyone should be above any law; not the men and not the respective company; but most certainly, the Indian government should at least be trying to take the moral high ground on this one and abide by international law as well as its own, but it isn't responding to international efforts to allow contact, lawyers and official statements on the issue. It won't clarify any information about the health and well being of the men, which is of major concern.

Again, and I do stress, laws should be upheld, but in any legal case, mitigating circumstances are also taken into account, and the ship was forced to take safe harbour in Indian waters because of a typhoon. It was not by choice. Although this is being disputed by the Indian authorities, they have not been able to disprove the company's claims of this, despite having well over a month to do so, and they are still failing to provide any real cooperation through diplomatic channels.

Indian authorities say the ship wasn't near the typhoon at the time, but like I said, they have provided no evidence to disprove that, such as the ship's logs. I'm confident in believing that any ship's captain will divert course should he/she consider the risk to be at a certain level with time against him to act.

Finally, I feel I should let you know that the 'pirate hunters' headline was written by a sub-edditor. Journalists who write the articles seldom ever get to write their own headlines. Unfortunately, that results in many stories being misinterpreted, taken out of context, and more often than not, sensationalised.

The Daily Mail is fucking fantastic at that!

It's no secret that the midfield dynamic is out of sorts. It seems two arguments are circulating. The first is the issue of combination. This has led to scapegoating one of Allen, Gerrard, Henderson, and Lucas. The second is quality; none of the aforementioned players are an automatic selection these days.

Shelvey's transfer and Suso's loan alleviated some of the selection headache, but it hasn't made it any easier on Rodgers.

Gerrard's days are winding down, but his quality is undeniable. The call for more muscle in the midfield would see Lucas' playing time decrease, but nobody is asking for his departure. Henderson's versatility strangely enough keeps him from pinning down a position, yet it has helped us.

Joe Allen?

All I'm saying is that the TARDIS is REALLY big.  I wouldn't be surprised if it could fit an entire planet inside.

In DoTD Hurt Tennent and Smith are described as 'The Warrior' 'The Hero' and 'The Doctor' which i am interpreting as also meaning 'The Healer.' Now, we saw 8 make the choice to become The War Doctor, so is it possible that Smith's Doctor will be facing a similar choice, but this time the choice being what kind of Doctor does he want to be; instead of what kind of Doctor he needs to be?

In NOTD, we never actually hear what the Doctor's 'Name' is and it's made clear at the end of NOTD that a name is only as important as what it represents (thus the warrior, hero etc), indicated by the Doctor's seeming inability to answer even as his companions face certain death as if he doesn't want to face the answer/doesn't know it yet.It seems that in NOTD he visits Trenzilore after the fact, while the GI is trying to find the answer before it even occurs.

From Hurt through Smith I believe we've seen the different facets of the Doctor, and on the Fields of Trenzelore he will be forced to choose one, be it the warrior (hurt) who willingly joined the fight, or the hero (tennent) who had good intentions but truly never shied away from conflict and often found himself having to make morally ambiguous decision, or the healer (smith) who is known for the command 'run' and oftentimes actively avoids conflict but in the end finds that he puts those he cares about in harms way.

true,SillyNonsense,troughton,Troughton,"Youre using the word Retcon incorrectly. It means retroactive continuity, an alteration of previously established facts in the continuity of a fictional work. What you mean to ask is whether or not this is a bootstrap paradox.

It is definitely a retcon, because it was not planned this way by RTD from the start. As far as RTD was concerned, Gallifrey was indeed lost. In the real world, it is indeed a retroactive change to continuity.

Now, in the fictional world of Doctor Who, it doesnt seem to me like this is a bootstrap paradox because if that were so, the Doctor would *always* have remembered the Time War having ended well. There wouldnt have ever been any original timeline for him to cry about. That's sort of the whole point of a bootstrap paradox in that there would be no ""original"" timeline, and nothing to go ""out of sync.""

Instead, he remembers an original timeline in which he killed his own people. There was a distinct *change* that caused the timelines to go out of sync, resulting in the memory loss at the end of the special.

The end result is that the whole time we were watching the 9th Doctor mope around, Gallifrey really was hidden out there for him to find. However, this is the result of a real *change* to the timeline. It was not always this way in the grand scheme of the universe, but *now* it was always this way.

Then again, if it isn't a bootstrap, there would need to be an outside influence to cause the change. Instead, it was The Moment within the Time War that started this mess, which actually is in *favor* of a bootstrap. 

In theory the internal loop could have been created by an outside influence from a timeline we never saw. For example, the 12th Doctor finally figuring out how to solve the time war and going back in time to give the Moment sentience which later results in the moment creating the 50th loop. That would actually solve the logic problems of the special, but that's heading into fanfic territory.

Basically, it's inconsistent with itself and there is no actual way to decide whether it is a bootstrap or not. If it were a bootstrap, there would be no original timeline to remember. If it wasn't, then the Moment couldn't have started it by itself. In the end it's more of a matter of semantics than it is actual facts. Cheer up, have an ice cream.

The time lock is different to whatever the Doctors' ultimate plan in TDOTD is called.

The Time Lock seals the entire time war off from the rest of causality - presumably allowing an alternate flow of events instead of the excised chunks of ""war"" time.

But that was already in effect, and the war raged on *within* the time lock.

When Tennant and Smith's TARDI vworp into the shed, there is dialogue to the effect of ""The whole war's time-locked - how did we get in?"" ""Something must have allowed us"", at which Bad Wolf Girl makes an expression that indicates it was her.

The end of TDOTD sees the Time-Locked Gallifrey isolated within an additional pocket universe, while the Dalek fleet kind-of destroys itself (allowing for the innumerable stragglers we see throughout the new series).

There is no way in hell they are going to end it after Capaldi just because of some one off comment from an old episode. I know there are few rules when dealing with a show about a time traveling alien, but common people, be realistic about this stuff. Do people take it so seriously that they forget it's a TV show? Like, ""Why was Tom Baker there and why was he so old?! Did 4 never really regenerate?!"" Well, no, it's because it's a monumental 50 year episode and he was a fan favorite. That's why. ""Why is the Doctor always a white British male?!"" Well, because it's a TV show created in the UK. I know people get lost in fiction sometimes, I do myself, but sometimes there are no in-universe explanations, and we have to be realistic about it.

Now, suffering is probably the wrong word here but yes, I absolutely think it sucks that we have one of the actors to play the doctor not be willing to indulge into the culture that surrounds the show. Those who love the show have their experience diminished somewhat by it. He was in quite a few episodes that I liked but I would rather have had the role go to someone who would appreciate it more.

Honestly this seems like little more than a grudge. He doesn't want anything to do with Doctor Who because someone who worked on the show once was mean? That's not integrity, that's just being petty.

I can understand why he quit, that's perfectly fine. Not being willing to do what amounts to fan service is what I have a problem with.

true,BingoJabs,null,null,"First of all, I don't see too many people calling for AVB's head. Most people are just very pissed off that we are playing such shit football.

Second of all, please don't invoke glory. Because glory is about daring. It's about verve and nerve and talent. And the reason that Spurs fans are so angry is because we are playing dull, pedestrian, boring, joyless football. Losing is forgivable. Playing boring football isn't. Glory is about goals and invention and moments of brilliance. It's horrible to admit but right now Arsenal are playing Spurs football and Spurs are playing Arsenal football: grim, defensive and joyless. It's the first time in my life that I simply find the team boring to watch.

Third of all, yes, we have had to integrate loads of new players. Guess what? That isn't some crazy fluke. It's because AVB decided to buy lots of players. And frankly, I don't think that they are necessarily improvements on what we had.

Fourth of all, the system! Ah, the beloved system. Here's my problem. Under Harry Redknapp we played 4-4-2. We weren't perfect but we scored lots of goals and we finished 4th, 5th and 4th. AVB has tried to impose a system on the team that has resulted in us not scoring any goals. Even last season we seriously struggled to score and Bale had to bail us out each week. Here's a genius idea. If the players are struggling to adapt to AVB's system, maybe it's because it's not a very good system? Maybe it's for AVB to be flexible and work out a system that actually works, rather than trying to impose his system on the team whether they want it or not. Anyone can take a failing team and impose a new system to tighten them up defensively. It takes quite some talent to spend Â£150m on attacking players and not score any goals.

Fifth, is the squad that talented? If you believe the hype and the pricetags, sure. There's definitely some talent in there, but two years ago we had Bale, van der Vaart and Modric. We have some promising young players but I don't see anyone in the current squad anywhere near that good.

Sixth, we do NOT play attacking, positive football. AVB says that. Everyone parrots that as though it's true. We play possession football. We keep the ball well. We do not attack any more than any other Premier League team (with the exception of West Ham). 

So I hope we do well. I hope AVB has the answers. I hope we qualify for the Champions League. But do I blindly trust AVB? No.",0,1385416035,null,0,false,0,cdmvsjw,t3_1rff6x,t1_cdmvsjw,t3_1rff6x,null,1428510252,7,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,7

He is a penalty box poacher, and so we need to treat him as such.  Valencia set up perfectly to maximise his strengths as a lone gun, so why can't we?

He's smaller but very similar in style of play to Giroud.  Arsenal play him alone up front, and he's scoring freely for them at the moment.

The difference is that they have MULTIPLE creative midfielders, wingers who get to the byline to cross, and lots of rotational movement and fast, one-touch football from their midfield.  Our speed of play is way too slow, and too dependent on a single player (Townsend, Lamela, Walker, Lennon) making a lung-bursting run forward.  Everyone else is static.

Play true wingers, sacrifice a holding midfielder for another creative player or deep-lying playmaker, and FFS, teach the team one-touch pass and move.

Watched 'Alien' the other night, which I'd never seen before, and thought it was great, decided to skip Alien 2/Aliens and just go for Prometheus, but haven't gotten round to watching that yet.

Also watched 'The Departed' which I thought was *okay* but suffered from Nicholson essentially being miscast and playing an amplified version of himself, and also the ham-fisted imagery which seemed to just float into every scene somehow. I mean, the rat running across the balcony at the end? Dicaprio seeing the reflection of Damon in that mirror hanging trinket thing, which happened to show his reflection with loads of eyes just before? Just a bit groan-inducing.

Here's the rest of my downloaded films that I'm working through. Seen a few of them but 90% I haven't watched:

He saw a writing landscape that included a traumatized Doctor whose core issues were struggling with his guilt over being the last of his kind, and having killed them all.  He decided that he wanted to write a different Doctor who doesn't have that hanging over his head, and, further, he wanted to be able to explore relationships with other time lords and Gallifrey.  So he used extremely nitpicky language and plotting to change our understanding and perception of the entire series since it went back on the air in 2005, without *directly* contradicting anything that happened.  If you ignore the fact that it cheapens 9 and 10's guilt by having it based on false memories.  And if you ignore Cass's preference to die in a space crash rather than be assisted by a Time Lord after saying that Time Lords and Daleks are the same.  And if you ignore everything we are shown about Time Lords in ""The End of Time.""

There's no such thing as a ""meta retcon"" and an ""in-universe retcon.""  All ""retcon"" means is changing an established past narrative after the fact to suit a present or future narrative.  That is exactly what Moffat did.  As I have said plenty of times, there is no question that Moffat changed the Doctor Who universe, and there is no question that there are consequences and narrative casualties to him doing so.  The only question is whether those consequences and casualties will be worth having a Doctor unburdened by guilt, the search for Gallifrey, and having the Time Lords be a living presence in the universe again.

Given that a ""Link"" is defined as:

""an electronic link providing direct access from one distinctively marked place in a hypertext or hypermedia document to another in the same or a different document"" ^1

And given the information in the ""blockchain"" as defined by the protocol^2 contains no hyper-text or hypermedia, then it is simply impossible for a ""*direct*"" link to exist in the blockchain.

Your point relies on interpreting the data in the blockchain in a very specific way. By default, the blockchain doesn't contain links so there are no links. As I said, Pi probably contains the same links somewhere if you interpret it in the right way. That doesn't mean to say we can't use Pi in our calculations.

true,Sparklesnap,flair4,,"AVB is a smart man. His system is ""possession"", yes, but it's also direct. It's not supposed to be Barcelona, Tika-taka football; it's Barcelona/Selecao tika-taka press-everywhere defense married to a more direct, attacking approach. We haven't made it work this season, but we will.

Harry didn't have us play a 4-4-2, never had a ""system"" and just basically rolled the ball out each weekend and we got what we got. That was fine, but give AVB back Bale, Modric, and VDV, and i promise you he would have gotten us into the Champion's League more than once.

You talk about us struggling to score last year, and that's true I suppose, but we also tried to play Jermaine Defoe as a lone striker (he's never been, and never will be, a lone striker) and Adebayor, who was out of shape and out of form, for a number of reasons I won't go into.

You say that AVB should have to answer for the players not playing, because he ""bought them""? He didn't; Levy/Baldini did. Maybe AVB asked them to, maybe he didn't, maybe he had a say, maybe he didn't. But the bottom line is that he can't be out there with a controller playing FIFA, telling the players on a weekend ""no, dribble, here, play this pass, see this run, shoot *now*."" All he can do is coach, and the players have to pick it up.

And you've missed the entire point of this post; Last season, at the beginning, we scored a fair number of goals, but we also gave up a lot; we also weren't really playing AVB's system, we were still playing Harry's up-and-down, box-to-box style, but trying to integrate AVB's style.

You've apparently missed my point about AVB and last year compared to this year, so i'll try to clarify it. Last season, our trouble was conceding goals. AVB fixed it; we played far better defense as we became more comfortable in his system; that started happening about this time last year. This year, our problem is that we can't score goals; I'm trying to tell everyone (like you!) who seems to think that AVB's system is somehow flawed because we're in a run of bad luck, that *you have to give him a chance to actually put his system in place*. Essentially our entire attack is new players, and just like last year when the defense struggled because they were learning a new system, our attack has struggled this year, *learning a new system*. We haven't yet played the AVB wants us to; direct, incisive football. Since we haven't yet seen that happen, we can't say the system works or doesn't, because *we haven't seen it*. When AVB has had the his group of attacking players for more than 6 months, and we still can't seem to score goals, then i'll worry.

As to talent; no we have no 1 player who's *right now* as good as Bale, VdV (Was) or Modric. But we have at least 6 who can be that good *or better* - Eriksen, Lamela, Townsend, Paulinho, Siggurdsson, and Carroll. They are 21, 21, 22, 25, 24, and 21. All of them have the talent to be the best in the world at their position (Yes, I do think Townsend can be better than Bale). Are they the best now? No. But neither was Modric when we bought him from Dinamo Zagreb; he actually couldn't make it into the team. Bale was a LB.

At risk of going into a different topic, i'll talk about our Talent here; We used the Bale transaction to reset the clock on our ""window of opportunity"". Our ""best"" attacking 6 were Bale, Defoe, Lennon, Gylfi, Dembele, and Sandro. Our youngest was Bale, at 23; the others were 31, 25, 25, 23, and 23. See the change? Our YOUNGEST players, Gylfi, Dembele, and Sandro, just became some of our OLDEST players. Soldado is only 28, a full 4 years younger than Defoe. Taking it back further, Modric was 26 when we sold him to Real Madrid; VdV was 28. We got younger, and bought in bulk.

You're crazy if you don't think the summer buys are talented; they are. They're just young, and need time to adjust to the Premier League... just like Bale &amp; Modric did.",0,1385418007,null,0,1385419076,0,cdmwo7c,t3_1rff6x,t1_cdmwo7c,t1_cdmvsjw,null,1428509842,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

I'd like to think he won't be able to do it, but since this is his first season with them, we can't be sure right now. I definitely wouldn't put them top of the list of favourites for the title though based on the season so far.

The major difference between this United side and previous sides is the attitude. Evra said yesterday that he felt the equaliser was coming. Moyes makes strange substitutions that Ferguson wouldn't have made. It's early days, but they seem to be lacking that killer instinct they had before.

Not only that, but any time our game plan fails to work (such as conceding an early goal), we go to shit.  He doesn't know how to reinvigorate the team or change things up to respond to the opposition manager.  Just look at the Chelsea game...

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sale_of_UK_gold_reserves,_1999%E2%80%932002

&gt;The UK government's intention to sell gold and reinvest the proceeds in foreign currency deposits, including euros, was announced on 7 May 1999, when the price of gold stood at US$282.40 per ounce.[8] The official stated reason for this sale was to diversify the assets of the UK's reserves away from gold, which was deemed to be too volatile. The gold sales funded a like-for-like purchase of financial instruments in different currencies. Studies performed by HM Treasury had shown that the overall volatility of the UK's reserves could be reduced by 20% from the sale.

&gt;The advance notice of the substantial sales drove the price of gold down by 10% by the time of the first auction on 6 July 1999.[1] With many gold traders shorting, gold reached a low point of US$252.80 on 20 July.[8] The UK eventually sold about 395 tons of gold over 17 auctions from July 1999 to March 2002, at an average price of about US$275 per ounce, raising approximately US$3.5 billion.[8] By 2011, that quantity of gold would be worth over $19 billion.

&gt;To deal with this and other prospective sales of gold reserves, a consortium of central banks - including the European Central Bank and the Bank of England - were pushed to sign the Washington Agreement on Gold in September 1999, limiting gold sales to 400 tonnes per year for 5 years.[7] This triggered a sharp rise in the price of gold, from around US$260 per ounce to around $330 per ounce in two weeks,[7] before the price fell away again into 2000 and early 2001. The Central Bank Gold Agreement was renewed in 2004 and 2009.


The price rise did not happen until some months later in September and can hardly be attributed to Browns botched sale, all he did was announce it to the world and drive the price to a record low.",0,1385419745,null,0,false,0,cdmxfcn,t3_1rdbzb,t1_cdmxfcn,t1_cdmru9f,null,1428509490,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The problem for me is that youth alone is not, and cannot be, the only result.  Unfortunately, we are precariously balanced on the edge between the haves and have-nots.  One point separated from Champions League glory and Europa League ignominy last season, and it hurt us badly in the transfer window.  Soldado and Eriksen were not our first choices, and regardless of how they turn out in the long run, there's a feeling had we made the CL, we could've bought better.  Would Coentrao have still turned us down had we been in the CL?

I was a massive proponent, and argued on here throughout the summer, of buying an older CAM as well as someone like Eriksen.  VDV was the prefect example... he was young enough to still offer plenty, but old enough to be experienced and in full control of his abilities.  Eriksen looks like he'll be a terrific player, but perhaps just not this season consistently.  Arguably the best playmakers in the EPL all came here much older than Eriksen... Mata, Silva, Cazorla, Ozil.

And so building a squad with an eye for the future is all well and good, but should we fail to quality for the CL again, then we'll keep suffering from not being able to attract the top players (or managers, should Levy dispense with AVB).  And then we'll be behind the eight ball again next season.

I have no problem with giving AVB time, but sometimes you just have to cut your losses with tactics and move on.  We don't have the luxury of spending a whole season tinkering around trying to find something that works.  Results matter, all season long.  And it's now at the point where I honestly can't see this system working very well at all.

&gt;Sorry, you're just wrong.

What? About the fact that gold doesn't generate income and that it's a terrible reserve material? That's my main point here, and I'm not really seeing credible disagreement.

&gt;The price rise did not happen until some months later in September and can hardly be attributed to Browns botched sale, all he did was announce it to the world and drive the price to a record low.

I've no particular interest in defending Brown on a partisan level, as I think he was actually a good chancellor but a terrible prime minister, and the rise was an eventual unintended consequence, but the gold mostly went to British banks and financial institutions which then had something to back up their stated capital assets.

And whilst it would take numerable charts and graphs to display the evident for it, and I just don't care enough to produce them, there's a reasonable argument that being able to transfer the assets to liquid currency that could be used rather than gold which is a few steps removed from being used, halted the drop in the British economy.

But seeing as the 'he sold the gold' line is a great slur to try to smear Brown with, I suspect it'll take a little more history to happen before it's kind to him about this.

&gt;Not necessarily more children, but children that they can't afford.

Firstly, I made it very clear early on that I was talking about birth rates, no where did you even bother to mention anything else until only now.  You even mentioned birth rates yourself.  You then jumped to clutching at straws, mentioning immigrants.  Now, you are yet again backtracking and bringing up something entirely different.  I find it very hard to believe that somehow this was just some misunderstanding on both our parts.  You are all over the place, jumping from one claim to another.  *I*, on the other hand, have been entirely consistent throughout.  There is simply no way that you are being sincere.  Why should I be polite to you?  You certainly have not deserved it.

It might be the case that whatever remains is worth more than what was sold but that just underlines the stupidity of the decision or at least the motivation behind the decision (US banks, not UK ones). The gold price went down during the sale only slightly rising on an international agreement about gold auctions and only rising by 100$ per oz. It rose by over 900$ more subsequently and is still rising.

Would agree with all above (I've lived in Marchmont, Bruntsfield &amp;amp; Newtown), with the exception of the bit about Leith. 

The idea that Leith is to be avoided at all costs is commonly held misconception about the city based on outdated stereotypes. The foot of Leith Walk (around the Kirkgate) is a bit rougher but by no means unsafe (or different from similar lower income areas of the city.) 

Leith Walk itself is cheap, safe and fun - if a bit rough round the edges at times. There's plenty of nice bars (e.g Brass Monkey, Victoria, Boda, Woodland Creatures); some great places to eat (e.g La Favorita, Oregano, Punjabi Junction, Los Cardos) and some fantastic places to do your food shopping. There's two Chinese stores, a Halal store, a Mediterranean supermarket, a couple of Polish shops and a place which if memory serves has produce from SE Asia. All are reasonably priced and will make your diet here a lot more interesting! There's also a 24 hour bakery which you'll LOVE at 4am on a Saturday morning.

What's more, you're also never far from the Ocean Terminal Shopping Centre, which has plenty of retailers/cinema etc. 

Further, the area known as ""The Shore"" in Leith is NOT at all cheap or dingy (quite the opposite) and has some great bars (I highly recommend The Vintage, Nobles and if you get the chance, the Scotch Malt Whisky Society) &amp;amp; some of the best restaurants in the UK (including a handful of Michelin Starred establishments). Not to mention there's some incredible properties with sea views.

Saying all that, considering your age the student areas might be more suitable - but definitely don't score Leith off as a 'never visit' - it's great!

A while back, I was tasked with finding them a chief designer of transmission systems for the Wrexham location. What had happened was one of their mega diggers in Malaysia had a brake fault, rolled back and crushed some poor dude to death. All sales globally stopped. Millions being lost every day.

The remit was this: find someone with about 20 years experience of leading the design of off road, tracked vehicle transmission systems who would work in Wrexham. Money no issue - this is business critical, the most important thing the company is facing.

Ok cokey, off I go - I look for the guy at Mercedes in Germany, look for the guy in Italy at Fiat, look for the guy who used to work with Vikers making tanks. I track down (pun) the guy at Catapillar. I talk to people retired. I'm speaking to all kinds of guys.

All of them say the same thing: ""Wrexham? Err... No."" 

Then I find one bloke, late fifties, been designing transmission systems for big tracked vehicles for about 25 years, lead designer for a very, very big company, says yeh, fuck it, he'll do it. (Me: punching the air.) he's got a daughter who's 15, though, so he won't relocate the family and ruin her exams, but he'll live and work in Wrexham during the week. Sorted.

He meets the other designers. They love him. He meets the Directors. They love him. He meets the whole board. They love him. We negotiate an offer. All we need now is Bamford to give the ok.

Bamford has one question - ""Is he relocating to Wrexham?"" 

-No, but he'll live and work here during the week.

""He's not right, then. Next problem?""

-Er, we're still losing Â£millions plus goodwill and market position and this guy can fix that for us.

""I said no. What's next?""

true,Thekirbyness,tardis,TARDIS,"I think the movie sets up the regeneration into Capaldi very nicely. When we were introduced to 9, he was angry at himself and upset about the war, but Rose showed him the potential humanity has and how he can make up for what he did. So when the Parting of the Ways comes he approaches a time very similar to the Moment: where the Daleks threaten Earth and he can destroy everything but Rose shows him that there is a way to save everyone. From this he deems that he needs to be the savior and protector of Earth, and when he regenerates, that's what he becomes: a man dedicated to the preservation of Earth. Plus he begins to fall for Rose and thus when he regenerates he is a total heart throb for her.


For 10 the things he accomplishes early on seem scattered and random always with his regret of burning his people but in the post season 4 specials 10 realizes what power he has. He sees what he can accomplish and comes to terms with being the only Time Lord and lets go of what he did in the War. When he regenerates, he becomes a man that does big and universe-impacting things where everyone on every planet knows his name. (Which ultimately leads to the conflicts in 11's series)


Now with 11, this period of the Doctor's life is where he has put the War behind him and forgotten it. As a result he has become childish and silly (as well as physically younger) to cover up what happened in the War. During the movie sequence, the Hurt Doctor constantly remarks on 11's youthful actions and appearance even suggesting that he is going through a ""mid-life crisis"". He implies that 11 is ashamed of being older and that he needs to grow up and not be so childish like saying ""timey wimey"" plus Clara notes that she doesn't believe he has a job like an adult would. Therefore when 11 realizes he needs to grow up he will regenerate into a more mature doctor and at the end of the episode he seems eager to settle down (and be a curator), something that was unthinkable earlier in his timeline and shows his new maturity. 


Maybe I'm off but it certainly seems like the Doctor's mindset upon regeneration impacts who he becomes.

Granted if you only see the negatives in life it isn't going to change you overnight but the American style attitude that anything is achievable is evident here too and has a great impact.
It's important to look at what changes you want to achieve in life and whether moving to a new country will bring that. It isn't an instant fix and depends entirely on how the new country matches with your expectations and whether those expectations are realistic.

As someone who's played competitive sports all his life, I really don't understand this logic.  I would much rather MAKE a team than just be another piece on it.  Yeah, he could go play for Real... where he'd be just another superstar in a roster gushing with them.  Yeah, he'd see a lot of success, but think about how much of that success would be directly attributed to him.  And then his star will fade and he'll just be recycled for the next big thing.  Yeah, there comes a time when a player MUST move on in search of that next big thing.  But we're not talking about a player moving from Wigan or something.  If he wants more, earning it by being a center piece isn't out of the question.  Restoring a team to that echelon of greatness would be so much sweeter.

3) Due to niggling injury he can't train fully before game against Germany.

7) Rodgers, after viewing the match against Germany and the training on Friday recognises that Sturridge isn't fully fit and would be unable to give 100% in a high paced, frantic derby game where every man is needed. Subsequently he will start on the bench

Also, for some reason, I expect Capaldi to be much more aggressive than the previous incarnations.

Why? The Doctor has a lot of rage inside him. But he refuses to let it out, as he remembers what kind of man he can be. He has to power to destroy a whole civilization, his own people. So he always has to control himself. As he said in Demon's run: ""Good men don't need any rules, today is not the day to find out why I have so many.""
This is also why 10 hated guns so much. He knew he was dangerous, he knew what he could do with a gun in his hands. He didn't disapprove of guns because they were guns, he simply wanted to protect everyone around him from the monster he was deep down.

And now we have Capaldi's Doctor. He knows that he is not a bad man: he found a way not to kill his own people. He knows he is always on the good side.

Alternatively, the energy comes from an outside source - perhaps it is accumulated while traveling in the time vortex, and bodies have evolved to take advantage of it. We *know* that the change of face is a run-away effect; control is lost and the energy is too great. In fact, it is implied that the same energy gives Time Lords their impressive healing abilities in non-lethal circumstances.

He's the thirteenth incarnation, but the War Doctor was counted as among those 13 even though he wasn't using the name Doctor. That's why. And no one in their right mind thought that *The Time of the Doctor* was actually going to be the end of the show.

Presumably you're talking about 2011/12 in which case your return was late on February 1st.  That Â£1,300 penalty will be comprised of three parts.  Â£100 for being a day late.  Â£10 x 90 for each day late capped at 90 days and Â£300 for being six months late.

That third penalty you need to watch, because it's actually the greater of Â£300 or 5% of the tax due.  So when you put the return in it might jump suddenly.

If you want to appeal the penalties you'd probably be doing so on the grounds of Reasonable Excuse.  Possibly you might find it a bit of a hard sell to convince HMRC of Reasonable Excuse on the grounds of ignorance, **but** their sending correspondence to the wrong address might help you there.

One imperative of a Reasonable Excuse claim is that you cannot have additional delay after the excuse ends.  So get it dealt with as quickly as you can.  Bear in mind that you can amend your return up until 12 months after the filing date, so you can perfectly reasonably put in a return which you know is mostly correct and white space a comment for anything you have to estimate.

Try to not miss anything like bank interest, because it's the sort of thing that could be picked up in an automated check and earn you an enquiry.

I do  have a question though. As i perceived it the time war ended differently with Galifray disappearing(freezing). Was the time war then Time locked again? ... 
If not why was it necessary to utilize all thirteen tardises (tardisi?) in the day of the doctor? 
I perceive, and I may very well be wrong, that it was galifray alone and not the conflict that was frozen this time around.

If this is the case then the stakes in the end of time are somewhat diminished or muddled. If the conflict ended that way what happened to those dramatic sounding problems like the ""nightmare child or the could be king"" 
Perhaps these were galifraian super weapons from the vault?
I suppose the real question is, was the moment used? and if so, was it used to lock the entirety of the time war?

A couple of years ago I was back home in Newcastle on a lovely spring afternoon, having a quiet pint in The Charles Grey overlooking the Monument. As I sat there, I began to romanticise about moving back. The Gallowgate end in the rain at St. Jamesâ, the Tyne Bridge, the dialect which speaks to my heart. After all, isnât this where I belong? 


With this in mind, I headed out with a spring in my step and a whistle on my lips to catch the Metro back to my native North Shields. Standing there on the platform I recalled just how beautiful the little fishing town of North Shields really was. This is where I belong. 


This sentimental haze was however, quickly dispersed as a young gentleman stumbled his way round the corner and hockled up a dockerâs omelette within inches of my foot. 


*Narr man aâve gorra find 20 poond or wa getting fuck aaaaal the neet man*


*Naarrrr please man Kyle jus giz that last little bit man*. His lass squawked. Her neck, riddled with love bites and adorned with a necklace of gold plate, on the end of which hung a huge, golden clown.

I had been assuming this whole time that 'Handy' was part of that, since we didn't see a new face.  Using a whole regeneration to cheat death should come with the price of an Appearance/Personality change, from what I believed about the Doctor. I can believe that diverting the energy to the hand could have saved TEN's appearance, but should have created an all new Doctor (DoctorDonna?) in handy.

It'd been pretty damn good so far though, but I've heard of the  
dreaded shit-tastic ending. This will be the 4 series I've watched start to finish this year.

It's a horrible feeling.

It's like... all of your friends are now dead. All of them.  
All their hopes and dreams go unanswered and unfinished.  
And while you grief and mourn in silence, people pass you by without a clue that you're dead inside.

And you never get any closure, ever. You get angry.  
""How could they just leave us like this!?!""  
Then sad.  
""But they did... they just up and left, not caring how we would feel.""  
You can't ever fully recover.  It's like a piece of you has been taken.

And you can never fully explain the pain, your friends and family don't even notice that you spend all your time searching for outtakes and bloopers and fan fics and behind the scenes treats.

It consumes you and it hurts and there's nothing you can do about it.  
You're subject to this emotional roller-coaster of pain and loss and your strapped in tight.   
But you have to go on, you can't just lie down and stop.  

These people. Your closest and dearest friends are now gone. Forever.  

And it all starts with two words.

The End.

He said if you look at all the stereotypical American comedy heroes, they are always the quick witted, snappy come back kings. Like heroes in comedy movies are like say, Adam Sandler, where he bumbles around and people laugh at him, but he ""wins the day"" through his superior wit etc. They are funny but they still win.

In Britain, some of the best comedy heroes don't win, we much prefer the seeing the character's plans fall apart. Mr Bean is probably the best example of that. 

In the UK people are often quite reserved, and that's reflected in the way our humour is very self deprecating: American comedians make jokes at the expense of others, British comedians make jokes at the expense of *themselves*.

Ultimately you wont really get what it's like living here from watching TV, well not fictional TV anyway. My advice would be if you're coming over is for your initial time here remember you have two ears, two eyes and only one mouth, and use them in that proportion.

So you can the whole history at once and decide whether it makes sense, but you can't generate the future from the past through iteration.

Without time travel, all causal arrows point back into the past - it's necessarily a directed acyclic graph. Introducing a cycle (causes that go back in time) means you can end up with events whose causes *can't* be traced into the past - they can just point around and around the loop with no origin. So when your simulation reaches a point in time when a time traveller might arrive, it doesn't... cannot... have enough information to figure out what happens next.

I've seen a suggestion that causality, including the lack of cycles and hence the absence of time travel, is **the** fundamental principle in the universe - that space and time themselves can be seen as the natural way to take a causal diagram made up of discrete events and arrows and generalise to make it continuous.

Easy enough to understand, maybe not to the younger audience or (sarcastic speechmarks are sarcastic) ""intelligent and non biased critics"".

* Tear in the fabric of reality

Simply put, a portal-like object created from a universe damaging event or paradox.

* Isolated sonic shifts

Not so simple. Specifying the atoms of an object, isolating them from each other and ""shifting"" themselves apart, shaking apart or disintergrating the construct. Or at least that's how I understood it from context with terrible science knowledge.

* Planet being frozen in an instant of time

If the critic was paying ATTENTION, maybe this would be obvious. The planet was put in stasis by a network of energy; if you will, it was put into cryogenic stasis without ice, but time.

See? Not 'mumbo jumbo', understandable terms. Listen and think before you bitch about how the worlds longest running scifi show interrupted your precious X Factor! ",0,1385434225,null,0,false,0,cdn3krj,t3_1reyng,t1_cdn3krj,t3_1reyng,null,1428506549,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

I personally would say start with Eccleston so you don't miss out on David Tennant. If you start here you will still have the story of the doctor without going too far back.

If you want a really quick synopsis; The Doctor is a Time Travelling Alien who is the last of his kind. His ""species"", the Time Lords, were in a war against their mortal enemies the Daleks. To stop the war he destroyed all Timelords and Daleks and therefore he is known as the Last Time Lord. He Travels through time and space saving people and planets, often accompanied by a ""companion"", usually hot girls. Special thing about being an alien is he has 2 hearts and the ability to regenerate when he is mortally wounded/dies, when he regenerates though his whole personality and face changes. Also carries a Sonic screwdriver which helps him open almost everything.

true,thspdrdr,flair8,,"OK, I think this is deep enough in the comments to express my opinion on Arry.  I agree with you.   
Arry was not a tactical genius, and was at times absolutely clueless about tactics altogether.  But he is an incredible manager with very different approach than AVB's.  Whereas AVB has a system in mind into which he drops players, Arry builds his team and tactics ENTIRELY based on the players he has.  Arry starts with the best 11 players, and then figures out what's the best position for each, and bam - you get a formation.   
I loved that quality of his because it brought out the best in players.  If you look at the growth of individual players under Arry, it has been immense.  Think Walker, Bale, BAE (when he was improved player of the year), Kaboul -- they all improved tremendously under Arry.  It is true that some players got frozen out (Corluka and Kranjcar come to mind), and that I did not like.  However, on the whole, individual players grew in ability and it was beautiful to watch.  Heck, he even made Livermore look good (not to mention Parker).  **I'm going to go so far as to say that no player did worse under Arry than he did before he arrived** (so long as the player got game time). 
I miss that. AVB certainly does not have the same effect on players' abilities.

The main point of the entire episode is that the Doctor has been running from Gallifrey his entire life, even before the Time War. After the events of the episode he will be running towards it. When we first met the Time Lords in Classic Who they were already assholes, and every time you see them they and the Daleks get worse and worse. The Doctor left this society, for whatever his reason he is obviously not like them and he left them. 

Now, finally,  he has the wish to return home. The Doctor, whom they call the renegade, the madman, the failure. but who they also at one time called President. He will have saved his home from itself, from the path of becoming like the Daleks because they would from then on look to him as the savior, and not someone like Rassilon who essentially became an immortal tyrant before in Gallifrey's infancy. His underlying motivation has finally become saving his people too, and not just everyone else's. 

You want angst? Here's the catch, it's lost in a paralell universe stuck in a moment of time. Instead of killing his world, he froze it and cast it into the infinite possibly never to be found. So now he won't say he kiled his people, he'll say he banished them to save them. Literarily it's almost the same thing. And don't you dare think he'll actually find Gallifrey quickly. It's took 50 years to have this character's changing point, and Mffat said it is meant to move the show forward. All Doctor's to come for the foreseeable future will be ""searching for Gallifrey"", and even if it is found quickly then fine. Gallifrey has changed almost as much as the Doctor in how it and the Time Lords are used in the show, which is itself about change.

Embrace the change.

When he was invited to appear on ""Five Doctors"", he apparently had some steep demands to return which would have profoundly affected the script and would have taken the central focus away from the current Doctor at the time, Peter Davison. Baker famously even bailed on the promotional shoot for the show, which the producers were clearly expecting as they had his wax figure from Madame Tussauds ready to stand in for him.

Baker has said in interviews that he was not the easiest person to work with on the show and that when he began to talk about leaving he was not exactly discouraged from doing so, so there may have been some hard feelings still lingering at the time (much like Eccleston).

He has stated in the years since that he regretted his decision to skip the show, and later made an appearance in the 'dimensions in time' special and of course 'day of the doctor'.",0,1385450163,null,0,false,0,cdn9982,t3_1rav73,t1_cdn9982,t1_cdlqo6s,null,1428503829,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

There is no link between terrorism and psychopathy or mental illness.

At the very least, such material is a notable and important part of the mechanism by which sane and well-balanced people turn from having normal moral calculuses to being willing and able to murder innocent people.

It reminds me of all the negative shit people said to me about emigrating (you'll be back etc grass ain't always greener etc)

I emigrated and went from earning 22k GBP here to 32k GBP in my new country. 

What's more is money goes further here so I would be able to lead a better life even if I were still on 22k GBP and no more paying 850 GBP for a 2 bed house in the south west! Oh forgot the council tax so rent is actually 950. My rent if so more sane here.

My point is if you're on minimum wage as an example almost any country is better anyway as rents arebso extortionate here.

The fact the sun is shining most days makes a hell of a difference though and after doing a two week holiday back in the UK recently made me realise you couldn't move me back to that dreary shithole if you took ten grand off my wages

The gist of the article is that Chicharito is a great penalty box player but can't get into the Man Utd team because these days most teams play 4-2-3-1 and that means a lone frontman. And a lone frontman is rarely a poacher. A lone frontman tends to be either a big, bruising hulk like Lukaku or Benteke or someone who can hold up the ball and bring others into play, like van Persie or Rooney. Soldado is none of these. He's a penalty box poacher.

Which is really puzzling. Because it basically means we paid Â£26m for a striker who is almost totally unsuitable for the system that AVB wants to play.

I want to semi-disagree with that.

Moving to another country is a lot of (often stressful) work, both with finding a place to live and establishing yourself in a job market different to the one you're accustomed to. You also need to learn an entirely different system of government and the rules applicable to a new country. In short, overcome obstacles you would have never had to contend with at home. Overcoming problems brings satisfaction and builds self confidence and self esteem.

Getting to know another culture, seeing new places and meeting new people are priceless experiences that will stay with you for life. It won't make you a different person, but you collect memories that you wouldn't have had at home. This is especially true if you move to a big place with a high rate of other immigrants, because you literally get to speak from people from all over the world and it broadens your perspective of the world and teaches you things you might have never learned of at home.

It doesn't change who you are but it might change how you view the world. And often happiness is about perspective.

true,thegenregeek,null,null,"Let me use a real world example (without trying to be too controversial):

When a village in Afghanistan is bombed by US forces fighting insurgence, do the locals differentiate between the soldiers on the ground the entire US government? 

Probably not. Likewise the universe would have a similar perspective to the whole of Time Lord society. Because the agents doing the most damage would have done so on the orders of the High Council. This is to say that not everyone on Galifrey is a Time Lord, many are civilians. Most anyone with a TARDIS tends to have approval from the council to travel and tends to act following their orders. They would be considered the defacto military force of Galifrey (and thereby the Time Lords)

The Doctor is unique because he stole his TARDIS, in order to do what he wanted. (At times he followed the Councils orders and at other time he willfully disobeyed.)

So my point still stands. Ultimately it was the Time Lord council that turned evil. They were the one manipulating events, willing to destroy entire worlds for their own ends. Sending various Time Lord agents out on missions. But the Time Lords on the ground, because they were fighting a war, could have been evil or good. Regardless their actions cause far too much destruction.

Another factor to consider is that we don't know what kind of weapons were being used. Its entirely possible that the equivalent of drone technology was being used in place actual Time Lord soldiers. So, like the Afghanistan example, does the use of drones change the perspective of those caught in the crossfire? Does using that tech allow the High Council to hide what it is doing from the general population on Galifrey?

Now that that's out of the way, I think you should be able to wet some regular felt and mold it over the top of the thimble. From there, you will probably want to figure out a way to 'seal' the felt so that it will keep it's shape, because I think if it gets wet again, it'll flatten back up? You can use construction paper on the inside to help maintain the shape a bit, too. Now that I think about it, perhaps you could make a mixture of white glue and water, and then wet the felt with that.

true,EnglishMobster,smith,Smith,"Well, he was fatally wounded. He would've eventually died once the wounds became too great, but while he was still conscious he chose to use some of next regeneration to heal himself.

From my interpretation, regenerations only change the appearance of someone if they're used all the way -- the tap is turned on full-blast, as it were. This stops death, but the intensity of the energy causes the Time Lord to lose control of what form his regeneration takes.

Ten stopped this by only turning the tap on part-way -- just enough to heal a mortal wound. However, all this energy has been released, and he can't just use *some* of it, so he stored the rest in his hand as a sort of ""battery,"" which he could then use the next time he got wounded. Since some of that energy had already been used to heal Ten, it wasn't the full-force regeneration that causes a new face but instead a managed partial regeneration which allowed Ten to heal himself.

That said, I honestly have no idea. That entire finale was poorly written, in my opinion. Davies had what he figured would be a good idea (""What if there were two of the same Doctor at once?"") and decided to exploit deus ex machina after deus ex machina -- why did the Doctor just keep his hand around? I get that Harkness gave it to him, but that seems like an odd thing to keep about.

My old next door neighbour. Mad cow, has a ten year old kid. She fucks ten guys in a gangbang for coke, the film goes online. It's getting shared around the community.

Ex partner contacts redtube, says pull it down. They ask why, he says there's a rape enquiry going on. Down I comes and can no longer be found on redtube or other similar sites.

There wasn't a rape case, he wanted to protect his ten year old kid from seeing his mum get fucked by ten guys at once.

Now, is that censorship that restricts everyone's freedom? Or is it purely about protecting the dignity of someone who would be profoundly hurt either now or in the future?

Again- not to say right or wrong, but there was no 'slippery slope' that's going to end with us living in a fascist dictatorship just because censorship was done to protect  someone's feelings that might be hurt.

(This is a response to your an other's comments).

Again - I get the idea that mass, blanket censorship is a bad and troubling thing to be avoided. I'm with that - but if it were my dad, brother or son getting murdered on film and share by nasty wankers I would want to have it taken down.

I earn in Dollars (freelance for a US firm) and since coming to Belgium, I have been able to afford to start saving again and paying my overdraft off. For the last 4 years of working in the UK, the last week of the month has been hell.  I would have no money (overdraft maxed out when at uni because of low maintenance grant and I've never been able to pay it off). 

Since leaving the UK (3 months ago) I checked my balance yesterday and I have about 40% of my gross pay left and I get paid on Friday. I think this is the first time in my life where I will have paid rent and not be in my overdraft! I wonder if staying in Europe for another 6 months could have be entirely debt free and then I might be in a better position to consider coming back to the UK.

quick edit: I also love the UK and will come back, just not sure when.

All it would take is Labour (or the Conservatives) to say ""this is a once in a life-time opportunity... with the Conservative vote failing to smaller parties, if you remain loyal to Labour and vote for us whilst the Conservative base doesn't we can win a crushing victory! And if we do, we promise X, Y and Z!"".

It's even worse than that, if it looks like the Conservative base is falling to a third party, Labour would *actively fund* the third party to draw even more votes away. It's politics 101, really.

A lot of people will go with the latter option and vote for Labour with this in mind. Then we're back at square 1 again with Labour. It's just how First Past The Post works. It's how it's *designed* to work... because it keeps the power with those already in power and stifles the ability for large change. It also concentrates power into a couple of major huge parties - who then become easily susceptible to corruption and less influenced by the popular vote because they know they'll just flip-flop in and out of power permanently, even if they implement outrageous policies like the Torys are currently doing. But it does give the nice illusion of freedom of choice when in reality you're voting for *who you want the second least* rather than who you want the most - a completely broken system.

Unfortunately we threw out the AV which only further proves how futile voting is ultimately. First Past The Post is broken fundamentally. The shitty choice of candidates is just a symptom of that problem, not the problem itself.

----

Dear Nicky Morgan,

On Wednesday 23rd October, the Prime Minister suggested that the government is working towards tighter online restrictions towards 'extremist' sites, ""setting out a whole series of steps that [they] will take to counter the extremist narrative, including by blocking online sites."" [1]

I make a point of limiting my usage of the 'slippery slope' argument. However, developing governmental ability and workflows to systematically and automatically block entire series of websites, based on their content, is an intensely worrying thought for me as a citizen of this country, that I genuinely do feel could take us down that slope.

Who will define and validate where the line between ""extremist"" and other views lays? To who exactly are these views extreme? How would these actions impede our ingrained rights to freedom of speech across all media? What right does the government have to authorise what we can and cannot read, whether online or in another medium?

I do not have faith that actions of these sorts will be truly constructive in their aims, nor that they will be possible to limit once in effect. As my representative in Parliament, I implore you to resist any such legislative moves towards a system where the government can limit what we can and cannot read online.

Yours sincerely,

REDACTED

That being said, translation for customers was appreciated in our area as well as a few choice words everyone picked up from the Nepalese staff (faster, terms of respect to certain staff). New staff who were still learning English (and their trainers) were given more leniency until they improved as teaching the job is much easier if it is explained in a fluent language.  

Sure the poster was phrased badly, but it seems a lot of exclusion was going on in the area which would be a sackable offence if deemed bullying.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"I like Lennon, but at this point i would much rather have Lamela on the right than Aaron.

I will say this about Lennon, when he plays and he is on the right...Walker  is much more involved in the attack with Aaron. You can see the impact of multiple seasons together, they seem very fluid with each other and they do something we seem to do very little of with Andros...they stretch the pitch down to the end line.  With Andros he very quickly looks to move inside and Walker seems less involved in the attack, Andros also looks to cut inside at ~18yard mark which doesn't allow for that overlapping run.  With Lennon, Walker seems more involved his runs are taken advantage of and his link with Lennon is very natural.  

I would prefer we use Lamela on the right, but i think Lennon can serve a real beneficial role as a super sub coming in on the right (not only for his linkup with Walked but i just don't think he is overly effective on the left for long periods) and using his pace to attack tired defenders.  

What you see with Lennon is what you get, he is pacey and a solid dribbler, not a great finisher or crosser but he has always served as a player who can completely disrupt a defense when on the pitch.

The arms trade is bolstered by overseas wars and increased spending in national security and decreased regulation leads to those arms arriving overseas. Increases in military intervention in those areas from outside influences (like the UK government in Ireland) leads to an ""us and them"" mentality which makes it increasingly difficult to find non-military interventions and causes escalations in violence. 

As such I believe that militarisation of an area is something we can do something about, given that western governments are already causing an increase in militarisation of those areas.

I find it hard to respect that stance when he accompanied it with the most boneheaded and futile political maneouvre of the last 10 years.

Remember in 2008 or so, when he was fricking *shadow Home Secretary*, he decided to resign as a member of Parliament in order to protest against the Labour government's policies on detention without trial?

This guy was pretty much the Home Secretary-in-waiting, who merely had to sit on his arse for two years until the Tories won the election, and then repeal the very laws he was complaining about from a position of real political power. Instead he pulls the stupidest stunt possible by quitting his job, standing for, and winning, a futile Mickey-Mouse by-election with no opposition, then going back to the Commons without being reappointed by Dave Cameron to the one job that would have allowed him to actually do something about the things he was complaining about.

Maybe he was doing this to avoid getting sacked by David Cameron before the election anyways - in which case, the principled thing to do would have been to let Cameron sack him and then castigate Cameron from the backbenches for not opposing the civil liberties crackdowns that Labour was putting into practice. 

Either Davis is stupid for pulling a worthless stunt that cost him the power to uphold his principles, or he's an unprincipled careerist who used said stunt to draw attention away from his being sacked, in order to not embarrass the guy who sacked him. Neither way fills me with admiration.

When he is paired with Sandro they both seem to work well together.  Sandro is going to do what Sandro does and it seems that Dembele does what he does exceptionally well...progress the ball up the pitch at his feet from deep.

Paulinho seems to set up a bit higher and leaves Sandro a bit more isolated whereas Dembele sits a bit deeper to help Sandro and serve as the link by carrying the ball forward.  Against city this happened quite a bit where Sandro was left to cover a massive swath of the pitch on his own with Paulinho further up the pitch (and frankly with Dawson unable to cover as much ground), it ended up pulling Sandro all over the pitch and causes the whole midfield to shift (along with the wings) to cover for Sandro having to cover so much ground all around the pitch.

AVB is the headline of the week because we were just shit in every aspect of the game against City, compound that with the spend (regardless if the net spend was minimal) during the summer and it is an easy story to get published and that will get clicks from readers.

That said, if we don't start playing better these stories will continue to show up and begin showing up in all the papers.  These stories will begin being the subject of a daily section on Talksport and will become a pundits favorite subject on the tele.  Once the heavy momentum starts building in the fan base it becomes very difficult to slow it down.

Personally I think we should stick with AVB but i also think he needs to start showing some more flexibility in his tactics and squad selection.

Truth is if we got rid of AVB (again, not a fan of this idea) we wouldn't have a great deal of choice as a replacement at this time.  We would probably end up with Sherwood or Les Ferdinand as the manager in the short term while we wait until managers become available following the season/world cup.  Which would be unlikely to be able to improve on AVB's performance.

We need to figure out how to score, we need to ensure that we don't play like we did during City again.  We have things we need to fix and i think we will do it.

And there's nothing to be done, because we live in a country where the 3 major parties are virtually indistinguishable in terms of policy, and 35% of the vote is enough to rule practically unchallenged.  When your major choices are ""Centre-Right"", it's not much of a choice.

layer up!  instead of one big parka over a shirt, wear a hooded sweatshirt over a few shirts and a jacket of some sort.  if the weather isn't as bad, or if the crowd becomes packed, you'll be too hot in that parka and too cold in just a shirt, but layers mean you can have multiple stages of undress.  another bonus is that you can tuck things in to avoid getting snow down your pants.  you can tuck your shirt into your long-johns, then wear a second shirt over that, then tuck the second shirt into a pair of sweatpants or jeans, and then wear a hoodie over that.  and if you're wearing longjohns under your britches, you can tuck one layer into your boots and let another hang over the ankle.  this keeps the snow out of your boots.  lastly, the best way to stay warm is by trapping warm air against your body, and layers will accomplish that goal.

make sure your outer layer is water resistant at the least.  when snow lands on you and melts, you don't want to get soaked through.  at the very least, get some good water-proof boots, that will be an absolute must-have.  cold feet are the most miserable thing, and since the feet are the farthest thing from the heart they get cold the easiest.  that's why people lose toes easier than any other extremity (although that really just applies to hikers in more extreme conditions).

A wide-ranging filter that Cameron is talking about would require proactive content checking, which means a massive increase to the IWF's budget (or the budget of whatever organisation gets the task).

The IWF is currently funded voluntarily by ISPs, but if the cost grows greatly it might fall to the government to fund it.  Which means that this would then go beyond the current ""gentlemen's agreement"" between the ISPs and the government to implement the filters, and becomes a publicly funded initiative that would require explicit approval.

And then, fingers crossed, a year or two down the line when it comes time to actually pay for this clusterfuck, it gets quietly discarded as a waste of fucking money.

Teenage Mutant **Ninja** Turtles was called [Teenage Mutant **Hero** Turtles](http://i.imgur.com/e4cM1ws.jpg) in the UK because local censorship policies deemed the word ninja to have excessively violent connotations for a children's program (in Ireland, however, the first season aired as ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" before changing to ""Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles""). Consequently, everything related to the Turtles (comic books, video games, toys, etc.) had to be renamed before being released in these nations, as well as in the German-speaking countries (which was a dubbed version of the UK / Ireland version).

The lyrics were also changed, such as changing ""Splinter taught them to be ninja teens"" to ""Splinter taught them to be fighting teens"". The policies also had other effects, such as editing out use of Michelangelo's nunchaku (which were at the time banned from even appearing in 18-rated movies in the UK) and generally toning down the usage of all the turtles' weapons.

Source: http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/444778/If-Scotland-says-yes-you-will-be-stuck-with-euro

&gt; New members do not have to adopt the euro immediately if they do not meet the economic conditions, **but must sign up to the single currency in principle with a view to joining at a later date**.

&gt;JosÃ© Manuel Barroso, the European Commission President, has previously stated that **only the UK and Denmark will not be forced to join the euro in the long term**.

&gt;Mr Salmond originally claimed that Scotland would automatically inherit the UKâs membership, opt-outs and rebate but was forced into an about-turn when Mr Barroso stated it would have to apply from scratch.

Additionally, we know from ""The End of Time"" and ""The Night of the Doctor,"" Rassilon and the High Council were very bad news. The weapons in the Time Vault were forbidden for a reason. Rassilon and the High Council were just as bad as the Daleks, and would have caused just as much devastation if they had been left unchecked. The Doctor's choice to destroy Gallifrey was just as much about the Time Lords atrocities as it was about the Dalek's. 

The Doctor was forced to wipe out the civilians fleeing in terror and the rank-and-file soldiers just doing their duty because letting the war continue would have meant the end of *everything,* not just Gallifrey, and he didn't have four hundred years to think of an alternate solution.

A few key points to clear it all up:

* The **only time** in history when the Scandinavian nations can even somewhat be considered to have been in a union was in the late 1300s - called the [Kalmar Union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalmar_Union). Although it was a form a political union - it was a form of medieval political union, and has virtually no parallels with the 21st century. 

* There was a primitive form of **exchange rate mechanism** called the [Scandinavian Monetary Union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavian_Monetary_Union). It wasn't ever a monetary union like the Euro though - but rather each had their own currencies pegged to the value of gold. So in effective it should actually be called (by modern terminology) the Scandinavian Exchange Rate Mechanism. At any rate it was over about 40 years later at the end of the first world war, at a time when many nations were abandoning gold standards because the Bank of England (then the biggest bank in the world) had a liquidity issue in the wake of the 1st world war which meant that tighter controls were placed on the gold market - and many nations (like German) could not physically represent their currency in gold reserves because it the currency had depreciated so much.",0,1385477038,null,0,false,0,cdne71v,t3_1rhkmy,t1_cdne71v,t1_cdnd6sg,null,1428501524,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,Wommie,cnty-uk,Man of Kent,"Academia.  I'm a lab tech looking after SEMs and electron microprobes in a small research dept. at a university, mostly working with geologists finding out precisely what their rocks are made from.

As said by another commenter the pay rate is higher then what I would be getting in the UK.  Not so sure about the cost of living.  Currently getting absolutely raped on car insurance and car finance.  The state I live in isn't allowed to penalise young drivers for being young on their car insurance, so they penalise everyone who hasn't held a drivers license in the state for the first three years.
Also ""fresh"" produce seem more expensive then the UK and is generally over ripe or wilting on the shelfs in the likes of Walmart.  You can get around this by spending even more at farmers markets or a more Waitrose type supermarket.  I've never even seen lamb on the shelves, how I miss lamb :(

Experiences with health insurance so far have been mixed.  I get 80:20 (means I'm only expected to pay 20% of the costs) through work for around $30 a month, 70:30 wouldn't cost me anything extra.  Touch wood I've not had to see a doctor yet anyhow.  I think I pay around $25 a month for eye insurance.  This is pretty good to be honest, I get nearly a years worth of contact lenses for that, $150 to spend on glasses frames, and quite a bit of my eye exam is covered.  Dental has been a massive con however.  $30 a month and they refuse to pay for anything other then two basic checkups a year for the first two years your with them.  Had a nasty shock after having a crown fitted here.  After originally being told my insurance would cover half, that they wouldn't and I've have to stump up the whole $1100 for it.....  God bless the NHS.

Yes petrol is cheap, but it needs to be since there's fuck all public transport here.  You can get trains from large city to city, but they are generally delayed, much worse then the UK, freight trains are king here and they will hold passenger trains for them.  Trying to build up the nerve to cycle to work, although I may well need to try out that medical cover since people drive like maniacs.

Great thing about where I am, is it's a couple of hours to some pretty damn nice beaches in one directions.  Three to four hours in the other direction and your in the mountains and my God are they beautiful.  When you hear about people never leaving America it's not surprising, I could live here for the rest of my life and probably never visit all the places I want to.  Some of the other cities in the state are amazing places as well, one I live in not so much, nevermind.

Also I'm in the Bible belt, if your not a church goer like myself, prepare for people not to talk to you if you mention you don't believe.  Sundays bring out the rudest mother fuckers ever, in their cars and stores with their self righteousness I'm better then you because of God crap.

Tipping doesn't bother me, unlike a lot of UK people I see complaining about visiting the states.  Service workers get maybe $2 an hour if they are really lucky and often expected to buy their own uniforms, so leaving 15-20% on whatever is no big deal.

The only part I don't know if I agree with you on is the statement that AVB needs to show more flexibility in squad selection (tactics, I'll give you).  We have seen lots of changes in personnel, including 6 changes from the Newcastle match.  In some respects he's been a bit hamstrung with injuries (mostly left back), but I think he's shown a willingness to shuffle the deck so to speak.  How many different players have we seen on the left wing for instance this season?  Plus this week he dropped the ""undroppable"" Townsend, handed Lamela his first PL start and played Lennon down the right.  Also installed Kaboul back into the starting lineup and gave Ade 45 minutes.  

I still believe it is a matter of getting the best out of the players and while we were calling for patience for the team to gel a couple weeks ago, now everyone is in reactionary mode after the losses to Newcastle and City and saying ""enough with this needing to gel bullshit"".  It's not just a matter of all of these players being new to Spurs, but most are new to English football and struggling to adapt.  I think it is safe to blame AVB for changing too much too fast, but I think his hand was forced a bit with Bale leaving plus most in agreement that Dempsey, Parker and Huddlestone (as much as many of us loved them) weren't going to get us into the Champions League.    The fact that we have been rubbish and are only 4 points off of second gives me hope that if we can turn it around soon, we'll be alright.

And what of the Union between the Kingdoms of Sweden and Norway 
to which I explicitly referred?

&gt;Norway and Sweden were in Union at that point. Remained so until 1905.

From,

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_between_Sweden_and_Norway

****

&gt;The Union between Sweden and Norway (Norwegian: Unionen mellom Sverige og Norge, Swedish: Svensk-norska unionen, Unionen mellan Norge och Sverige), officially the United Kingdoms of Sweden and Norway, comprised present-day Sweden and Norway in a personal union under one monarch between 1814 and 1905.

&gt;...

&gt;The events of 1814 resulted in a union of two sovereign states that had the same King, foreign policies, and diplomatic representations. Each had its own independent laws, parliament, government, administration, church, army, and currency. However, the King mostly resided in Stockholm, Swedes were initially viceroys in Norway, and foreign policy was conducted by the king through the Swedish foreign ministry in Stockholm. Later in the 19th century, a union cabinet consisting of ministers from both countries was called to discuss matters of foreign policy.
 
****

&gt;There was a primitive form of exchange rate mechanism called the Scandinavian Monetary Union. It wasn't ever a monetary union like the Euro though - but rather each had their own currencies pegged to the value of gold.

I guess I'm a retard too.

&gt;Why can't someone have an affinity for a place they have never been?

The grass is always greener, it pisses me off knowing there are people (some of which I have met) that are so in love with a place and it's people that they have the wrong picture and that they're willing to put their head so far up your arse just because you're a lucky prick that was born to it.

It winds me up knowing people like this cannot recognise that they have a lovely country and are a lovely people with a lot of history. People who cannot cherish what they have and hold it deer annoy me, I love my country even chavs which I despise at the same time, I love it all. I love other countries and their peoples but I'm not going to lick their arse and pretend it's golden.

Look not all Anglophiles are like that but EVERY Anglophile I've met and they're not all American has been like that. 

It annoys me when these people cannot see the flaws as well as the greatnesses our country has to offer, it annoys me that people wish they could throw everything they have away just to have been born here all while spending such little time here. Those who earn their British passports are my countrymen and they are the ones who prove me wrong. 

Maybe the way I see these people has spoiled by a few but I cannot respect anyone that amounts to this, I see them as edgy children who need to grow up and see how great they have it.

I take issue with the extremes yes but I also take issue with anyone resembling anything close to that.

I'm sorry but we'll have to agree to disagree. I think the facts are on my side but I'm a bit tired of giving them thought at this stage to dig through the government reports. To reiterate, the warnings weren't out of the goodness of their bleeding hearts, but because slaughtering civilians wantonly would erode any public support, such as the unthinking financial support from Irish-Americans and the 'hard man' support from otherwise normal lads who get a pint in them and break out the songs about thickos who blew themselves up attacking an army barracks. In the end, it was their continual ineptitude in *not* killing civilians, and the questionable motives of the 'Real' IRA, that completely killed any support for the Provos or continuation after the ceasefire, outside of a few dozen lads in Northern Ireland itself.

I'm not a Pavee but I am interested in their experiences in the UK.

true,HungryHungry-Hippo,wales-brecknockshire,Londoner,"&gt;We have been supplied with previously unseen and unedited footage of the incident from five different cameras. The CCTV footage does not determine the issue completely as it could be consistent with either the accounts of the officer on the gate or Mr Mitchell.

&gt;It is clear from the footage that there was sufficient time for the words to have been said either as described by the gate officer or as described by Mr Mitchell, and this has been confirmed by an expert. The fact that an expert has confirmed what is possible does not of itself determine the issue.

So maybe he did say it, maybe he didn't

&gt;It does show that there are a small number of members of the public present immediately in front of the gate at the relevant time, but what cannot be seen is how many people were immediately off camera but in the vicinity, at least some of whom then quickly came into view.

&gt;This is consistent with the officer's account that several members of the public were present. No officer ever mentioned ""crowds"" being present â this was first mentioned in Channel 4 News/Dispatches programmes in December 2012 and February 2013 â which showed edited footage that was less than clear in a number of regards.

I'd be sad to see Scotland leave (I think we'd all be poorer for it, and I don't mean financially) but I don't want Scotland to stay part of the union only because they think they'd get x y or z. That seems uncomfortably close to bribery.

A basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and MySQL and how to build a site using Wordpress makes her skills valuable. Sounds like a lot to learn but all you need to do is [read a book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023487.do).  It'll be fun, seriously!

Obviously it's not every ones cup of tea but there's a ridiculous number of free online resources to develop these skills and it could very easily open up a new career path for her if she's struggling to find a direction.  Additionally, qualifications are irrelevant if you can demonstrate an ability to do the work.

true,cbfw86,uk,South West London,"&gt; To say that pornographic and more so music industries are somehow to blame for this is ludicrous and most importantly it shifts the real blame.

Bullshit.

http://www.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/content/publications/content_667

While the links are controversial, to say that kids are picking this behaviour up from somewhere else when there is zero evidence and no leads as to the cause is just silly. To absolve the porn industry of blame purely because you like porn is shifting blame. Calling for further exploration of the links is anything but shifting the blame.

Also, if anyone honestly thinks that this behaviour is natural then you need to spend more time around children because you clearly don't have clue about how innocent kids really are. And even when their sexual motors do start runnig in puberty, teenagers don't just wake up one day and think, ""I'm gonna rape Claire,"" as part of their 'growing up'.

It seems quite obvious that these misogynistic behaviours of trading girls around the gang and using them as an asset are learned and they are learning it/piking up these cues from somewhere. The obvious leads to chase up are the porn industry (where women are routinely portrayed as available and 'up for it'; where ""it"" can be replaced with whatever your mind can conceive) and the amount of sexually suggestive images and lyrics in movies and music. If these prove to be non-starters then you look somewhere else, but it seems completely obvious to anyone with a brain that the idea that sexual violence is acceptable is being learned from material which conveys sexual violence as acceptable (i.e. most porn these days).

And if anyone is interested in violence in the porn industry then read the newsnight coverage on the topic. It's hardly peer reviewed analysis and discussion but it is nonetheless well researched and dispassionately argued.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23700395

&gt;Peter Johnson, who runs the Authority for Television On Demand, which regulates on-demand porn in the UK, says: ""The change in the business model has meant there is an enormous amount of viewing of porn around the world and particularly in the UK. On some of the free sites statistics suggest the UK accounts for 5% of global traffic flowing to the sites.""

&gt;...

&gt;Mr Johnson, who was formerly head of policy at the British Board of Film Classification, says: ""***I think over the past 15 years there has been a marked change in the nature of pornography being offered. We're talking about a subtext of violence, hair pulling, slapping, spitting, abusive language during sex - the very extreme gender power relationships in which the man is all powerful and the woman is submissive.***""

&gt;""Over the years I've been involved in regulating this sector, **porn producers have started off with ethos of, 'We're not going to go down abusive route we're going to make nice pornography' and have tended to move towards stronger and more abusive material**,"" Mr Johnson says. ""***That's where the market drives them***. That's where customers appear to want more extreme content.""

It seems entirely evident that porn these days is a source of violent sexual imagery, and you don't need to watch 3 hours of it to spot the general conveyance that women are there to please men. It seems entirely sensible for a politician to say that in establishing the root causes of sexual violence among young people you should consider porn as a starting point. It's not shifting blame at all.",0,1385480908,null,0,false,0,cdnfj76,t3_1rhhhc,t1_cdnfj76,t1_cdnen9f,null,1428500900,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,oppositeofbrucewayne,smith,Smith,"Until this point I hadn't really counted the meta-crisis as a full regeneration since it wasn't complete and there was no change of his body. Now that've had a whole hidden incarnation, and going off the latest news that Moffat seems to be counting it, I'm not so sure.

It would make sense if the Doctor's apparent 'real' death at Trenzalore was just to signify the end of his current regenerative cycle. This could also be why Clara never saw any future incarnations, however I guess they could explain that away by her only seeing the Doctor's past. 'Eleven' chose to forget the War Doctor, so Clara didn't meet him in any of his adventures like she did with all the other past incarnations. In the same way he doesn't yet know his future, he didn't yet know the events of ""Day of the Doctor"", so the Claras wouldn't have seen that either. This all becomes moot if Clara clones start popping up in future stories, but hey time travel.

Things get murky then if you think about Capaldi's cameo. Did 'Eleven' not notice this? As much as I loved his surprise cameo, if they had left it out it would mean that only the Doctor's current cycle was there and that might be a way to get round having any future Doctors there. Otherwise that could imply that Capaldi truly is the ""thirteenth"" (if nominally twelfth) and last of the cycle.  Unless we're to believe all future Doctors were there but just not seen.

""We'll be better off if those lot over the border just bugger off"". I think a lot of the arguments along this line are often deeply flawed (lots of promises when the reality will be different) but I wouldn't care even if they were all right. I like Scotland (and the rest of the UK). I think we all have far more in common than separates us.

Really?

It would be madness for UK taxpayers to fund the bank which is the lender of last resort for what will be a foreign country. We are not bluffing"". When the news goes up on Iplayer I'll check back to make sure I've got that right.

Now I'm fairly uneducated on the economics of this so please could you explain why it's in the UK's best interest to form a currency union?

Edit: Beginning at 09:44 on BBC News at One, Norman Smith (Chief Political Correspondent) reports on statements made by Ministers in Westminster. He reports that they have stated: ""Harsh choice number one they say is that an independent Scotland could not expect to keep the pound. Why?

Secondly, as people have pointed out over and over in this thread, Mignolet is part of the defensive unit, and his job is to not let goals in.  It just so happens he performed above and beyond what is expected and Agger and Skrtel performed below what is expected. As a unit, though, they performed well enough to not lose.

I tried. Voted Yes to AV, even though it's a poor substitute for Proportional Representation. But if a section of the country has a significant movement towards electoral reform, why is it their duty to shun that opportunity in favour of remaining within a union in which the vast majority don't want such reform? It's not Scotland's fault that there's no significant clamour for devolution and/or federalisation within England, and I'd like to think that by voting Yes, we can set an example, rather than giving the impression that we're better off simply because we've gotten away from ""that lot over the border"".

I care about this, too. The thing is, with the referendum I believe I have a chance to make a difference to one of those cities, rather than watching them both decline under the two-party system.

true,SirMuttley,cnty-uk,British in Bangkok,"**What it is**

There is no bill or legislation making this happen. The big 4 ISPs have agreed to implement filters after pressure from the government.

The government say they want all ISPs to have them, but in reality there is nothing making them and a number of the smaller ISPs have already said they won't.

The ISPs will manage the filters themselves (or pay a 3rd party) there is no centralised government controlled filter.

**How it affects customers**

New customers will be presented with a screen on signup asking if they want filters or not, the ""yes"" option will be automatically ticked but there is nothing stopping anyone (other than laziness) from ticking ""No"". 

Existing customers will, according to the government, be asked by their ISP if they wish to have the new filters or not. They have left it up to the ISPs how they wish to do this. As far as I can tell the ISPs have been pretty quiet about how they're planning on achieving this, my guess is they're working on the first part and hoping then Government has gotten all the political karma from Daily Mail readers they care about and the existing customers might be quietly forgotten. Personally I have various ideas about how I'd implement it if I was an ISP so I'm quite interested to see how they do it.

Basically as it stands now you won't wake up one morning and find your access to xhamster is gone, the ISP should approach you first before turning on any filters.

&gt; Dear John Hayes,
&gt; 
&gt; I am writing to you regarding the recent announcement that your leader
&gt; made regarding the blanket censorship of the internet as detailed here
&gt; http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0001.htm#13102356000002

&gt; 
&gt; The Prime Minister: We have put in place some of the toughest controls
&gt; that one can possibly have within a democratic Government, and the
&gt; TPIMs are obviously one part of that. We have had repeated meetings of
&gt; the extremism task forceâit met again yesterdayâsetting out a whole
&gt; series of steps that we will take to counter the extremist narrative,
&gt; including by blocking online sites. Now that I have the opportunity,
&gt; let me praise Facebook for yesterday reversing the decision it took
&gt; about the showing of beheading videos online. We will take all these
&gt; steps and many more to keep our country safe.
&gt; 
&gt; I am concerned that the censorship of 'extemism' in this instance is as
&gt; defined by government. I am concerned that, without too complicated a
&gt; political process, websites voicing dissent at the government can and
&gt; will be filtered.
&gt; 
&gt; Under the proposed filter, would Sinn Fein, a party democtratically
&gt; with elected members, have been filtered during the troubles in
&gt; Northern Ireland? Would websites condemning the war in Iraq have been
&gt; filtered? Will websites organising legal, peaceful protest be blocked?
&gt; 
&gt; The filter, as is obvious to anyone, is a block to honest democracy in
&gt; the UK.
&gt; 
&gt; I am interested to hear whether the proposed filters have your vote in

To me, the objectionable part of this story is the idea that parents want to/should be able to allow their children on the internet unsupervised. That's not something that should be encouraged - far from it, if parents don't have a working knowledge on the web, then it's ridiculous for them to be upset if they sit their kid down in front of a screen and leave them be.

Most importantly, it seems like a radical twisting of the facts to call this 'government censorship', considering that no legislation is being proposed, and ISPs are behaving voluntarily.

true,w00master,null,null,"I disagree. Moffat is doing what all showrunners do. Help add and/or craft the mythos of Doctor Who. 

The concept of Regeneration has not remained static in the history of Who. From 1 to 2, it wasn't even called regeneration but as renewal. Initially, 2 was supposed to be a younger 1. From 2 to 3, we get the idea that regeneration actually is an entire physical change and not just ""renewal."" The Doctor changes faces! From 3 to 4, we *finally* get the term ""regeneration"" placed into the mythos of Who along with a bunch of Buddhist trappings/ideas. 

Moffat is adding to the concept of regeneration the idea that it's also about energy: namely regenerative energy. This is how IMHO he explains regeneration limits. Time lords throughout their existence have a limited total of regenerative energy. Sort of like in video games, you have a health meter or experience meter. Once you use up your total energy, you can no longer regenerate. Hence, this explains meta crises as well as the ability to heal River. The Doctor may have enough to do that but not regenerate entirely. 

Addifionaly. this is the 50th. Moffat has said on numerous occasions that he wants to ensure the future of the show. One of which is to start getting rid of some of the Who baggage: namely regen limit. We all knew this would eventually take place, why not address it now and get it over with? I think that's the right move. 

Finally, I'm glad that Moffat putting in actual consequences for using regenerative energy rather than RTD's notion of doing regeneration (or acting like it) for the sake of TV audience numbers. I'm glad that Moffat chose *not* to ignore it. Regeneration/energy shouldn't be a throwaway thing. It should have consequences.

Because he's a lot more fun.

It's like asking why 'Doctor Who' is called 'Doctor Who' and not 'The Time Lords'.

Also the Night of the Doctor is about the 8th Doctor regenerating into The War Doctor; he got to choose what he became in his next regeneration so he drank a potion that would make him into a warrior to fight in The Time War. All other Doctors did and do not get a choice of what they're going to become.

Also you do realise The Time War happened off-screen in between 1996 and the 2005 reboot? The Doctor had 8 other lives before Gallifrey fell and he destroyed many enemies including the Daleks. He also got the Time Lords pretty mad because he just went around doing whatever he likes and a lot of other contributing factors that just made him seem insane and crazy in comparison to the high standards that the Time Lords upkeep.

Yes, hurt is 8,5. And how the daleks know him? Beats me, but they usually don't fear him until they hear the name. Im s02 of the 2005 series season 2 finale, ""Doomsday"" the daleks spot the doctor, and then ask Rose who he is.
So I believe he is feared by name.


And in the minisode, we saw Paul Mcgann, the 8th doctor! As far as I understand it, he regenerates by using the time power or whatever, that is in the TARDIS. And thus being far away from the TARDIS, he maybe didnt have enough to regenerate?

true,SirMuttley,cnty-uk,British in Bangkok,"&gt; Oh, so it's a voluntary thing on the part of the big ISPs?

Well i wouldn't use the word voluntary, there is no hiding that the government has pressured the big 4 into doing this. However there is no legal requirement, it could be argued the government would just legislate if they didn't do it, but legislation is harder to get passed than a lot of people here believe.

&gt; If that's the case, what's the fuss?

The fuss is... well some people just don't like the idea of anyone ""censoring"" their internet. That's fine and there are a number of fine ISPs who will not be implementing filters. AAISP is the most common discussed here.

There are arguments that this puts into place infrastructure that will allow the government to start blocking websites at will. But that's bollocks in my opinion. The same infrastructure to do this porn filter already exists at 99% of ISPs, this doesn't really add any anything new. It also ignores the problem with the filters being customer controlled and not centralised in any way (i.e the government would have to ask each ISP to block the page).

&gt; Most importantly, it seems like a radical twisting of the facts to call this 'government censorship', considering that no legislation is being proposed, and ISPs are behaving voluntarily.

I have massive issues with the way people have twisted the reality of the situation in order to spread FUD.

Personally i think the filters are being done wrong. I have nothing against allowing people to opt into filters but I think by automatically selecting ""Yes"" it means people will get the wrong idea and think they are some how magically protected.

If I were to do it, I'd offer the filter with no option selected and if they picked yes it would give them a disclaimer that it doesn't mean they can just let little johnny run around on the internet without supervision as the filters are not 100% effective and really meant as an aid for parents rather than a solution.

So in the ""original"" timeline, the ""9th"" Doctor (Hart) uses the Moment and burns Gallifrey... 

The Moment ""AI"" though then shows 9(Hart) this future and creates a new timeline when the 50th special happens... so the ""original"" timeline has never been seen in the series until ""TDOTD"".

Though I'm still not clear on how ""The End of Time"" fits this if the doctor refused to face what he did as the 9th doctor and didn't fully ""forgive himself"" as the expanded discussions and notes have been stating.

Also IF 10/11 (Tennant... numbering now is gonna be sooo annoying) KNEW that he didn't destroy Gallifrey and that it never fell, why was he so nasty about it in ""The End of Time"" rather than trying to find some way of slipping it back into the main universe without destroying the Earth then?

Bizarre tactics. I looked at that team and went ""2 big men up front away from home with no width - that is never going to work, we won't create anything and we'll be overrun in midfield"". And to nobody's surprise exactly that happened. We won against Cardiff starting the game like that, but did he forget we were awful in that one until he brought on Lowton and changed the formation?! Strange that he thought it would achieve success, there was nothing at all to suggest it would.


Inexperienced players. You don't really need me to run through this one, but it was clear all over the pitch. Defensive mistakes, inability to keep the ball, poor decision making in attack and generally panicking.

 
Hoofball. Play 2 big men up front with no midfield outlet and that is what you are going to get. McAuley and Olsson absolutely loved it.
 

Starting slowly. We've conceded the first goal most of any premier league team this season. It makes it so difficult.
 

Character. We were shocking, we went 2-0 down, but we did not give up when we could have crumbled. We fought back and stole a point we didn't deserve.
 

Work rate and pace up front. We can frighten any defence when we get it right. Though Kozak and Benteke worked pretty hard, they didn't cause them many problems. Weimann and Gabby came on and though they weren't great technically or beating several players, having them sprinting at the West Brom backline made things happen. They lifted the team, we piled players forward, the balls were raining into their box and we got the goals.
 

Picking up points when playing badly. A very nice thing we've started this season. Norwich - not great, won. Man City - awful for most of the game, won. Hull - not great, got a point. West Ham - pathetic, got a point. Cardiff - poor, won. West Brom - woeful for an hour, got a point. If we can start winning the games we play well, we'll be challenging for the title!  ;)
 

A LOT to work on in the coming weeks. Lambert's tactics have to improve as well. **But after all that we are level with 10th -  we play the bottom team at home this weekend whilst West Brom and Newcastle play each other, Swansea go to Man City and Southampton go to Chelsea.

In terms of the wider issues, that's normally how change happens isn't it? It would seem a bit trite to list the political causes that have started off as minority issues but have grown to become the dominant opinion, but surely that is how change happens in our political system? It will continue to happen in a post-independence Scotland too.

I did some work for one a few years ago - it was responsible for an unusually large population, being in a formerly rural area which has recently become urbanised, and it only had one full time employee. It now has more, as the parish's population is c 25,000, but the area it covers is also encompassed by a larger borough council. 

I just checked and the village I grew up in, population 1000, has a parish council, so I'd be surprised if yours didn't.

AIUI parish councils are responsible for some planning approvals, or consulted on them, and they're funded by a portion of the residents' poll tax. I would expect them to do stuff like manage the local recreation ground, mow the village green and erect park benches; maybe maintain the war memorial.

I'm not justifying this level of bureaucracy, I'm just sharing what I know of it. It's undoubtedly because the stakes are so low that the feuding is both so bitter and so petty.

Dear Mrs Ellman,

I'm a constituent of yours and I would like to express my concerns about the government's pressuring of Internet service providers filter the content that they provide by default. It is dangerous to do so for more than one reason.

Since the invention of the microprocessor nearly fifty years ago, I believe humanity has entered into a new era in a revolution you could compare to the Industrial, the Digital Revolution, if you like. And similarly to how the very face of society changed from an agrarian to an urban society as humanity entered the Modern era, society is changing as we adapt to the Information age. You can see this everywhere, from how traditional high street shops are failing as more and more of us shop online, to how I'm writing to you via email as opposed to handwriting you a letter and putting it in the post. That Royal Mail is being sold off is a sign of the times, but that's another issue.

With large changes like this, though, come the need to reevaluate what is important. As a member for Labour, you will know as well as anybody the conditions that workers had to endure at the birth of the Industrial age, before the freedom of association was guaranteed. As I understand it, in simple terms, freedom was king, including the freedom of employers to sack their employees for being a member of a trade union, since unskilled labour is easily replaced. Today we recognize that while freedom is important, the powerful should not be granted so much freedom/power over the weak. Things aren't ideal now, but they are better.

Similarly to that, we are at the cusp of a new age, and we need to make sure that similar abuses based on old values are not allowed. It is the sheer importance of the Digital Revolution that makes me write to you today. I bring to your attention the pressure the government is putting on the larger ISPs to provide a filter for pornography, amongst other things, on an opt-out basis, for the purposes of ""protecting children"". This is a dangerous thing to do, for several reasons.

First, it will give some parents a false sense of security and they will be more willing to not supervise their children. Many parents have an Internet connection but do not understand it, and will simply assume that this filter they haven't said no to will remove any ability for their children to find pornography. I don't know how much you know about the Internet, Mrs Ellman, but any filter will be trivial to bypass by simply downloading something like the Tor browser (which routes your connection through several computers across the world to guarantee anonymity) or use a traditional proxy, which is so easy to do that a child could do it. And they do do it, to bypass the third party filters some parents have in place. But that's only if they want to look for porn.

Not only that, but no filter would be very effective anyway, and certainly not a filter that ISPs are being made (or ""pressured"") to implement, rather than one which they have decided to implement as a selling point. Some parents, particularly the less technologically literate, will assume the filter works and that their children are now ""safe"". This will not be the case, even if they aren't looking.

Secondly, it is not up to the government to provide such a thing. If a parent wants to restrict their child's access to the Internet it is that parents responsibility to do so, not the ISP's, unless the ISP should choose to offer that as a feature. It has nothing to do with government and it should not be pressuring ISPs to do this. What counts as porn anyway? Some things are clearly porn and others aren't, but there are a lot of things which blur the line. Will those be gone too? Freedom of access to information (I draw a parallel to freedom of association) is too important today to restrict access to the Internet at the ISP level.

Third, if there is to be such a thing, it certainly shouldn't be an opt-out basis. This is providing a filter by default - can you see why that's a dangerous thing to do? This proposed filter isn't just for porn, is it? It will filter other things which the government deems to be harmful, such as websites espousing ""extremist views"" (never mind that any competent terrorist will use the aforementioned Tor browser anyway - so no filter will even be noticed), as well as ""esoteric content"", including web forums.

There is no reason the government could possibly have for wanting to block web forums by default if not to remove a major resource for criticizing them in the 21st century. I stress again that freedom of access to information is far too important to let web forums be lumped together with other morally charged topics to be blocked. Opt-out or not.

My final point is that it will cause private companies to hold a list of people who have opted out and by implication like to watch porn. While I'm not big on watching porn myself, I do think that that is a serious breach of personal liberty.
Whether the current government wants something more sinister than what it is implementing today or not, it is far too dangerous and must be stopped. It builds an infrastructure that could easily be used by a future government to seriously curb the freedom of access to information even more. It must not be allowed to happen. Is there anything you can do, as my MP, to help?

Finally I must stress that I do think this proposed filter is well intended. I do agree that children having such easy access to pornography is a bad thing, will warp their perception of women, etc. But it is an issue for parents, not government. The same way that if a parent doesn't want their child reading the Daily Mail, they simply act like a parent and don't let them read it.

They don't go to parliament and request that the government puts ""pressure"" on newsagents to put it under a cover and only allow people who have put their names on a list which the newsagent keeps, to do with as he likes, to buy a copy. That would be insane.

Sorry to write you such a long letter, but I would like to hear your thoughts. Can you do anything to help?

They are only used when approved. The time lords DO NOT meddle. They stay back and watch time unfold. The doctor steals a tardis because his quest, his intentions ARE to meddle and help people if only by a little. Not always to big extremes, especially during fixed points in time. 

The war doctor - john hurt - is a warrior. He seeks out the daleks to end the war. He goes by his own rules. Hence why the time lords and daleks are afraid of him.  He has existed before the time war and fought the daleks for hundreds of years and gone against the time council countless times and done his own thing. He was a rebel hundreds of years before the time war and before he was 8.5. 

In the night of the doctor the EIGHTH doctor was going to regenerate. However the reason why that is so special is because for once he got to CHOOSE how he regenerates and chose a warrior. The doctor does not fight, kill or destroy - BUT for once he was able to become something different, something that was necessary for the war.

An inexperience time lord steals a tardis and begins traveling through the Time Vortex with it. However they never had much training with the TARDISes but they have some piloting skills but not much. As they are going through the time vortex they put the breaks on in the middle of transit before the tardis reaches its intended destination. I imagine it was like squealing tires and then launching. But this isn't a car its the tardis. So in theory the TARDIS open up another Time Vortex inside the original Time Vortex causing a massive shockwave that went from the current time the time lord was in and reached into the past and future. Now the wave eventually picked someone up from the Dark Knight Era or around the year 5,000,000,000 because it reached into the past and future from the present location of the TARDIS. Now at the end the TARDIS materialized on a planet and the people that caught in the shockwave showed up crash landing onto the planet the TARDIS was on.

Note: I don't care if people say I don't think that could happen for this reason. I was playing a game and had to get three characters to meet from two completely far out time frames I did it.

My Questions.

What would the outcome be out of the shock wave of that type?

What damage and consequences would it have on the universe?

What damage and consequences would it have on Time?

If any damage or consequences-

What would the residual effects be if the situation was repaired or taken care of?

If there are those who would think no residual effects than ignore that last question.

It's an obvious fact that scarcity exists. It takes wilful ignorance to believe otherwise. Lets take land. It is a scientific fact that the arable land on earth is limited in area. It is a scientific fact that the sunlight that is able to reach the surface of the earth is limited. Those are hard limits, no amount of innovation can create energy from nothing, it's a physical limit of the universe. Ultimately all economy and ecology comes down to energy. Scarcity is and always will be an unavoidable fact.

You could I suppose start splitting all the atoms to get more energy out of them, but you're destroying those atoms in the process and producing ...other stuff, some of which is very nasty.

&gt;Shutting down weapons export to those areas would make a difference, it would not solve all the problems that cause violence, but to suggest that someone with a rock could cause as much damage as someone with an assault rifle is ludicrous.

How much damage they cause is immaterial, rock based or AK-47 based, a warrior culture is going to glorify things like death and slaughtering your enemies, and those are the ""causes"" of terrorism that are the issue.

Not that the rock thing isn't absurd since theres tonnes of old (and replica) soviet weapons floating around, lots of regimes that don't give a fuck who they sell shit too (here's looking at you North Korea :D) and it doesn't take a highly developed industrial society to produce a fertiliser bomb, so unless you suggest we quit making fertiliser too (probably a bad idea) this whole worldview of yours is based entirely on the sands of Wishfulthinkingstan.",0,1385487763,null,0,false,0,cdniftu,t3_1rh8yw,t1_cdniftu,t1_cdni5ye,null,1428499472,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The timelords haven't used the Moment because, as they say in TDotD, how do you use a weapon that can pass judgement on you? Whether the Timelords fear judgement from their willingness to use the weapon of mass destruction or because they are, as seen in the End of Time, very corrupt and don't care about the fate of the rest of the universe (I suspect this answer is more likely as the minisode ""The Night of the Doctor"" shows how other species are incredibly angry at the Timelords and the Time War, implying that the Timelords are fairly unpopular). When the doctor uses the Moment (the most powerful weapon in the universe) it destroys daleks and timelords alike.  Now, as the most destructive weapon that has no sense of time (as shown when it uses Rose Tyler as a ""past... no wait future"" projection saying ""I always get those two mixed up"") we have to presume that the sheer power destroys/locks time around the event in questions (the time war). The End of Time takes place just before their destruction (I think they mention that the doctor has stolen the moment and intends to use it) so they try to escape. However, they WILL die (or so we believe). The only way to bypass the time lock is by the creator of the time lock/ most powerful weapon ever; aka the moment.

With regards to this specific issue. Perhaps porn and music do have an effect, who am I to say. I certainly haven't done my own research. But I'd feel that there would be much bigger causes, and much better ways to tackle the situation. For example - general poverty, gang culture, education, policing among many others. If altering or censoring the porn and music industries came into this, it surely would be far down the list.

It's a national park so planning permission is much much stricter and would have to go though a proper planning team which is probably why there is no point in having a separate parish council.  

The real difference between our area and this one is that if they needed someone new to mow the cricket pitch (local farmer has been tending ours for about 50 years for free) then yes they would go in-house  but the peer pressure would mean that someone would volunteer to do it for the price of the mower's petrol, a guaranteed spot on the tour and as many free cakes as they liked.

Q2:  Can you prove that the Moment device, besides wiping out planets and anything around them, is limited to only doing that?  /s

There is an objective reality, and that cannot be changed.  But no sentient being, including the Doctor, is a penultimate arbiter of ""what is reality"", and what happened at a split second, or sequence of time.  In this case, the instant in time where both civilizations were wiped out by the Moment, ""happened"".  But did the Moment actually wipe out both civilizations?  Or did the Moment suggest to the Doctors to come back to that moment of time, ""capture"" the entire Gallifreyan civilization in a moment of time, and then allow the (previous) Moment to blast away the space *formerly* occupied by Gallifrey, and the Daleks?   

What has changed is the *perception* of Doctor 8.  But Doctor 8 will ""forget"" the details of what actually happened, courtesy of the Moment device, and how time functions.

true,LuminiferousEthan,null,null,"&gt;We don't understand how the doctor is like, the doctor. Like, don't all the time lords regenerate? And don't all the time lords fly around in Tardises and like, meddle? So when did the original doctor be like ""i'm better than all of the rest of the time lords and let me take my tardis and go fuck around with everything""?

The Time Lords are an ancient race of aliens from the planet Gallifrey. Not everyone on Gallifrey is a Time Lord however. All Time Lords have the ability to regenerate. However, since the Time Lords have all sorts of advanced technology to time travel and such, they have taken it to be their rule to not interfere with the rest of the universe and other life forms that live on other planets because time travel can seriously mess things up with paradoxes and such. BUT, The Time Lord High Councel can also be real sticklers and impose pointless rules on the rest of the Time Lords. The Doctor got fed up with their politics and bickering, stole a time machine (of which they had a whole bunch) and decided to just go wander the universe, exploring. That's how he became ""The Doctor"".  

&gt;So like - in the time war, right? John hurt is like, doctor 8 1/2. But everyone was like OH MY GOD THE DOCTOR IS COMING. How did the Daleks know to be scared of him? How did the Time Lords know to be like 'goddamnit it's the doctor'? He's just notorious for meddling? So he was actually born like 104104801481 gazillion years before the time war, so everyone knows him?

While this is debatable, I don't see John Hurt as Doctor 8.5 at all. There can't be a .5 of a person. He is the 9th regeneration of the Time Lord commonly known as The Doctor. At the time of the Time War, The Doctor has already gone through 8 lives already. This is the ""classic"" Doctor Who that started with William Hartnell, Tom Baker and all the other classics. So he has already had many adventures, many lives, many dealings with humans and Time Lords and all sorts of other aliens. He is very, very well known around the universe. He has dealt with the Daleks before, and almost completely wiped them out on several occasions (But didn't because he sees genocide as wrong). So the Daleks are well aware of who the Doctor is, as well as how to detect him. 

&gt;Also, apparently in night of the doctor, the (sixth I think?) doctor legit dies and doesn't regen until some alien dudes are like, yo drink this shit. Okay but there were like five doctors before that, so like, how did they regen? 

That was Paul McGann, the 8th Doctor. He didn't ""die"", but was ""dying"". Time Lords can regenerate when they are dying, but if they, for example get blown to smithereens, they can die permanently. I only watched that mini episode once and wasn't really paying attention, but I believe the potion was so that he could have some ""control"" over *how* he regenerates when he does. A lot of the time, the regeneration is into a random new body/mind. They did this because they knew the Time War was coming up/going on, and that *someone* would need to be a ""Warrior"" in order to take out the Daleks, who threatened the entire universe. The Doctor, normally because of his own principles, and who would not commit genocide, might have to do just that, otherwise the entire universe is done for. So they made sure when McGann regenerated he would be able to commit the act, should he need to. 

&gt;tldr why is the doctor so special compared to the rest of the time lords. If he could freeze the planet in a little painting bubble, why couldn't they?

He isn't. The other Time Lords could have, and *would* have used the device, but the Doctor stole it before they could get to it. In the 50th, we see them talking about how they are going to use ""the final weapon"" or the last resort weapon, but when they get to their armory, it's gone. Then we see Hurt's doctor walking through a desert with it slung over his shoulder in a sack. 

Hope this helps.

They're not what matters to the enjoyment of the show. With a show like Doctor Who, which is all about changing history or rebooting the universe, the notion of fixed canon disappears with the fundamental premise of the show.

EXACTLY. I'm much more in favor of the idea that canon, while not unimportant, not be the be-all-end-all for the series. Obviously they will work around it however they want because the show will undoubtedly go beyond Capaldi's Doctor, so maybe we can wait until the Christmas Special to see how it's addressed before everyone has a ""REGENERATION LIMIT!!1!"" meltdown.

&gt;âI left Doctor Who because I could not get along with the senior people. I left because of politics. I did not see eye-to-eye with them. I didnât agree with the way things were being run. I didnât like the culture that had grown up, around the series. So I left, I felt, over a principle.

&gt;âI thought to remain, which would have made me a lot of money and given me huge visibility, the price I would have had to pay was to eat a lot of shit. Iâm not being funny about that. I didnât want to do that and it comes to the art of it, in a way. I feel that if you run your career andâ we are vulnerable as actors and we are constantly humiliating ourselves auditioning. But if you allow that to go on, on a grand scale you will lose whatever it is about you and it will be present in your work.

The BBC turned around and released multiple statement - written as if they were from Eccleston - basically implying that he was a prima donna who didn't want to be typecast and that he was ""exhausted"" and not up to the challenge of a starring role on a TV show. [Eccleston called them on their BS](http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/chrisd-off-with-alan-561304) and the BBC owned up to the fact that they had made that up.

My take is that he is completely justified in not wanting to return.

Also, I don't think Hurt's Doctor was ever written for Eccleston, as there was never a time when his appearance in the special was even likely. To write a character for an actor who has had that public a disagreement with a studio (and who all but said he wanted nothing further to do with them or DW *ever*) would be idiotic. I think Moffat *et. al.* wanted to use the anniversary to radically alter the universe of the show, and showcase a guest star of some serious renown (as they did in the Christmas special with Michael Gambon).",0,1385492485,null,0,false,0,cdnkjpq,t3_1rifo8,t1_cdnkjpq,t3_1rifo8,null,1428498487,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

The average house price in London is now Â£550, 000. The average *first time* buyer is 39 years old! I may have no in depth knowledge of the minutia of economics, but I can still tell that that cannot continue, there must be a tipping point. I'm saying prices will rise and rise until so few people will consider buying houses in London that the whole system will collapse in on itself. Many people may *want* to buy a house in London; whether they *could* is another matter.

And frankly, I feel what facts there are vindicate me. The Scottish government is pumping money into the construction sector through the ordering of new public buildings, investment in urban renewal and new energy opportunities. This has translated into a higher economic growth rate than rUK, a lower unemployment rate than rUK and, to my mind, more sustainable growth than rUK. 

Perhaps I am wrong, though; explain please, if you will, why you feel creating an artificial house price bubble is superior to investment in industry and construction.

&gt;The US doesn't let you in unless you have a job offer, is that discrimination? Australia requires you to be an expert in software engineering (or any other field where they have too many jobs available for the locals to fill them), is that discrimination?

The US and Australia don't have free migration in the same way which the UK does with the EU.

&gt;there's nothing racist about it. It's just sound economic policy.

No, it's complete and utter bullshit. People should be considered for jobs based on their abilities *not* their nationality. Companies who hire skilled employees usually make more money and in turn pay more taxes. *That* is a sound economic policy.

I would suggest arguing as articulately as you are able in support of the view you hold (which I will presume based on your post is that you are against the filtering.) I'm not going to lie to you, there's a good chance that you'll get some canned response saying, essentially ""Thanks for your letter, I fully support the P.M; fuck you very much."" But there's also a chance you'll get a letter of support written by a staffer for the M.P. or even the M.P. themselves, which is gratifying. Even if the M.P. doesn't support your view, occasionally you'll get a letter that appears to have had some thought put into it and it's good to see how ""the other camp"" views things and be able to reason more deeply about why you do or don't agree with them - maybe even write another letter in response.

Regardless of what kind of a response you get, it's important to participate in the political process and be an active member of society in political terms. People are increasingly becoming politically apathetic (and not without good cause) but it is important to remember that it is up to us to hold these people accountable for the decisions they make and to get them to listen to us and what we want - nobody else is going to do it for us.

The [Open Rights Group](https://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/2013/sleepwalking-into-censorship) is a great organisation, and their site is a good starting point when it comes to being more active around causes like this. That link should help you with regard to some talking points if you do decide to send a letter (and I sincerely hope you do.)

true,SirMuttley,cnty-uk,British in Bangkok,"&gt; They're forcing the ISP's to put the technology in place which would give them the technical capability to block any site at will. The opt-out/in nature is mostly irrelevant.

Who is ""them""? The ISPs can already block any site at will. It's a simple networking procedure.

If ""them"" is the government then how are they going to block any site at will when the filter lists are controlled by a number of private companies? Each ISP will have their own solution.

Also you seem to be completely over looking the fact that what you're talking about already exists in the form of much better infrastructure than this brings. That is the IWF list. In order to use the list ISPs already have infrastructure in place to block sites, and the big difference is they don't control the list of sites to be blocked; that is controlled centrally. Also customers can't opt out of the IWF list.

So basically in short, the idea this adds new infrastructure that'll let the government filter sites at will is nonsense.",0,1385494244,null,0,false,0,cdnlc89,t3_1ri02o,t1_cdnlc89,t1_cdnj6bt,null,1428498118,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,Frosstbyte,null,null,"As I noted in a different thread, this is all exceedingly semantic.  I understand that what happened in the 50th was War Doctor begins to use the Moment, which, as a setient device, prevents itself from being used, and which tells the War Doctor his punishment will be 400 years of guilt for deciding to use it.  Then, as he's about to use it, 10 and 11 come through the time stream to help him use it, before figuring out they don't need to use it, having calculated how to save Gallifrey over his entire life, freeze it in a pocket universe and allow the Daleks to destroy themselves.  Then, as punishment for ever even attempting to use the Moment, the Moment causes 8.5, 9, 10, and 11 to forget what they really did, leaving them only with the evidence of the destroyed Dalek fleet and a missing Gallifrey.  This causes them to believe that they did use the Moment, leading to 400 odd years of guilt and loneliness, until their timelines converge again for the events of the 50th, closing the loop, leading to the Curator convincing 11 that Gallifrey actually survived and it is his job to retrieve it from its timelocked state.

This is an extremely complicated (and, to be fair, fairly clever) way of both changing everything and changing nothing, but, as I've noted, I liked a universe without Gallifrey where the Time Lords were universally as evil and dangerous as the Daleks and where the Doctor had to live with knowing he did the right thing for the universe, but at a crushing cost to him personally.  I think a Doctor who was forced to make that choice *and did* is a more dangerous, more volatile, and deeper character than one who just *thought he did* and was tricked by a super intelligent sentient weapon into thinking otherwise.  When 9 chooses to save earth and not destroy the Dalek fleet, it resonates because you can see him choosing differently from Gallifrey.  I just think this solution, no matter how tricky and clever and complicated it is, robs the character of some depth, and makes him into an always good superman again.",0,1385494344,null,0,false,0,cdnlduz,t3_1reyng,t1_cdnlduz,t1_cdnj6ax,null,1428498097,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Good, the population distribution is horribly biased in favour of England.

It's also horribly biased in favour of London, also fine by me.

&gt;Remember, the only reason we joined together initially was because we had the same monarch.

That's not true at all.

Wales joined because England conquered them.

Scotland and England were united as a throne but the only reason Scotland joined the union under one government was because some fucking retards decided to get into incredibly national debt so they could have a colony in Panama which failed and then they were all bribed to join the union.

Ireland is the same story as Wales pretty much.

And anyway, even if it was a federation, like say, the EU, England would still have a massively overwhelming vote. The reasonable solution would be to divide England so it competes which it already does internally. The same way that Glasgow and Edinburgh are going to be incredibly biased for in a Scotland only country, well actually Aberdeen will probably pay its way to being important, but you get my point.

And the EU (a nice lovely collaboration) is extremely in favour of rich, wealthy and powerful nations. Those that have the most money and population have the most say.

&gt;I had heard that they would have been fine with an Independent Scotland joining the EU, so long as Scotland became independent with the consent of Westminster.

Maybe, depends what's happening with the regions at the time it happens. At the moment it looks like the Catalunian nationalists have been put in their box for a bit so it might not be as crucial. 

It does, however, set a precedent. That is a huge problem for countries that have very active regions - Belgium is a good example. 

This might also feed into any delay that Scotland faces once independent too, to make it look like hard work and discourage others from doing it. 

Either way - it's not a done deal that the EU will accept membership and if it does that ratification would be quick. the Scottish government is doing quite a bit of finger and toe crossing on this one.

Not only that consider the fact that the time lock was broken without damaging the timeline. Only one other being broke it, Caan, and that resulted in him having the Vortex enter his mind and 'see Time', very much like what happened to Rose.

The Sisterhood of Karn gave the 8th Doctor the [Elixir of Life](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Elixir_of_Life) and helped him regenerate into The War Doctor. Who knows if that was a ""normal"" version of the elixir or not?

Simplest solution, that act voided the 12 regeneration rule enforced by the Time Lord and effectively gives the Doctor an unlimited amount of regenerations. (Or merely resets the count)

That could then be the mystery of of Capaldi's Doctor. The 11th ""dies"" thinking its for the last time, then suddenly find himself alive. Given the fact that the Time Lords are still gone that's impossible so he now absolutely needs to find them to figure out what happened.

That is the thing though, a vote for independence is not a vote for the SNP, or their future.

True.

&gt; If the SNP didn't deliver on their promises then we could vote for someone else. 

Okay so do that at a UK level then.

&gt;I hope that independence will reinvigorate the Scottish political scene.

Probably will.

At the moment we are stuck with 3 political parties in westminster, all knee deep in neoliberal dogma, only one of which has significant Scottish representation. 


At the moment we are stuck with 3 political parties in westminster, all knee deep in neoliberal dogma, **none** of which has significant Brighton Pavilion representation. Therefore Brighton Pavilion should go independent. This is such a dumb point, you could apply it to anywhere. 

Scotland is a labour voting nation, that means that pretty much every rural county will have zero representation. 

The decisions are tuned for vote winning by central belt marginals, not the Highlands.

If we control our future... etc.

Why doesn't Aberdeen just decide to become Luxemburg?

I just hate this line of thinking, the idea that because you lost a vote you leave the country it's like a toddler throwing a tantrum. The country is democratic, no country with a population of more than 10 or 100 people is going to have perfect representation, unless your plan is to dissolve everyone then I don't see how this logic works.

Perhaps he isn't quite cut out to be a Liverpool player, or perhaps he will make the grade, but to say the Arsenal and Everton matches this season prove he's not good enough is a bit silly. He isn't what made us break down against either team and it's not very fair to blame him for it.  I'd say it's really quite the opposite and he stepped up to the plate well when we really needed a solid performance or two out of him.  His stats from the Everton match show it too as he had more tackles and interceptions than anyone else (9 and 4 respectively).  He got beat 1v1 by Mirallas a few times which was frustrating but he read the game well, kept himself in very smart positions, and made it extremely difficult for Everton to attack down his side of the pitch.

Honestly, I feel he is best used like Berbatov was when he was with us quite a few seasons ago. He wasn't pacey, he didn't move around much, but he was in the right place at the right time. This, more often than not, got us lots of goals because of his clinical finishing. Soldado is not in the right place at the right time because he is still adapting to the English game and how quick it can be. The whole team still needs to gel, which will obviously affect how well we move the ball into dangerous areas.

That way it's up to the consumer to decide what they want, and can learn about what options they have, and choose it. There is no lack of education that such a service exists.

What is more worrying is the apparent decision that governmental oversight is required to help the population decide, or even decide for them, what is suitable for us to see.

Bare in mind, the blocks will stop noone who is motivated to go out of their way to find whatever they like - that's the nature of networked computers.

What it does do, is set up channels for a high up figure to define what information of any type is able to travel through commonly used channels. It's filtering, not blocking (a technical impossibility), so fails in its design and creates possibilities for further, more unnecessary and unpopular decisions later on.

Once these channels of communication are open, government persuading ISPs to play along, the technology will be in place to block whatever they like at a moments notice. Centralised blacklists just make good business sense, rather than each ISP managing their own - who will have control of this? What is the process to have something added? Or removed if judged an accidental or wrongful addition to the blacklist?
