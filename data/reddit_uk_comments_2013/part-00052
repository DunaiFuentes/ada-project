Unfortunately it was a brand new system, pretty much still in alpha testing in the US, and I doubt that was ever brought up in contract negotiations (I was a lowly support dude TUPEing across so just had to live with the fall-out).  So we ended up replacing a perfectly good Tivoli/Notes solution with some bastardised web-app that didn't work.    By that time the client was tied into a five year contract, which meant we got hit with penalty clauses on missed SLAs etc which meant cutbacks which meant worse service which meant more penalities....repeat ad nauseum or until you find another job.

The white i thought was a great touch. Also you nailed just the right amount of it, so no argument there.

But my biggest problem with it are the tally marks. Great idea, but they look too staged, planted. I would have had them be more chaotic, some of different sizes, some bundled up in a corner and so forth.

true,Vaneshi,cnty-england,Midlander trapped in Hampshite,"First of all I'd suggest reading up on depression, it's a very complex mental health issue.  However, once you've done that I'm sure you'd agree with me that one of the side effects of that condition is, to some degree, a persecution complex along with a total lack of filtering; someone tells you that you're scum... you're scum.

The other thing to keep in mind is that it's unusual for it to just be 'log in to the website and randomly click apply 5 times' that's part of the requirements yes but often not the sum total of the requirements.   They usually stack so you've got to do that X times as well as all the other things (like attend a self stacking job). 

You can rapidly end up in a situation where you're working more hours to get your JSA than you were for your pay cheque.  And you're still scum in everyone's eyes. 

The 'TLDR' being that the depression over the loss of job is compounded by how the DWP go about 'insentivising' (and that freaked my spell checker the hell out, god damn buzzword bingo) your return to work.

true,noradrenaline,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,"I haven't done any travelling myself so can't offer any first-hand experience, but from doing lots of reading and having had some friends go, I suggest you read some of the following.

[The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has advice on British citizens going on gap year-type travels](http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/gapyear/).  They also publish [travel advice by country](http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/) covering areas and countries you should avoid, any etiquette that Brits might fall foul of and get in trouble over (eg dress codes/PDA in Saudi Arabia, or drugs in South East Asia).

[STA Travel](http://www.statravel.co.uk/) are a tour operator aimed at young people under 25, and can offer pretty good deals if you're a student or young person.  They also offer a whole bunch of pre-planned managed tours that seem good, even if you only take inspiration from them to plan your own route.  If you can get to one of their shops they have a lot of good advice to give - all their staff have to have been to at least two continents other than Europe, so they know what they're talking about.  

[Rough Guides](http://www.roughguides.com/) and [Lonely Planet](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/) are two of the biggest travel guide writers, and have guidebooks to just about everywhere in the world.  They also both have compilation books covering sights to see and experiences to have around the world - I have a hard copy edition of [this](http://www.roughguides.com/shop/make-time-earth/ebook/) and [this](http://shop.lonelyplanet.com/world/the-big-trip/), both of which make interesting reading.  When you settle on a region to see, pick up some guidebooks before you plan your itinerary closer to make sure you're not missing out on anything you didn't expect.  If you have a smartphone and are going to be in a more developed country with a low crime rate, take it with you and get some of their city guides.  It's handy to have information at your fingertips, and it saves carrying a book with you everywhere you go.  

[The Student Room](http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/wiki/Gap_Years_and_Travel) has some information, but I'm not sure how reliable or comprehensive it is.  It could prove a useful place to ask questions or find people to travel with - there's a forum on the Lonely Planet website they plug though their books that might be better.  

As far as maps go, I love [this style of pop-out map](http://www.waterstones.com/waterstonesweb/products/london+popout+map/8686087/).  They're available for most major world cities, and aren't much bigger than your wallet so are really easy to carry around with you.  It saves money on data bills from Google Maps on your phone too.  

For financing your travel, some of my friends took a year after uni before wanting to have a job.  In that time they spent at least six months working (mostly retail - Debenhams, Marks and Spencer, Asda, nothing long-term) while living at home to save up as much money as possible - extra temp jobs over Christmas etc if they could, to have as much to spend as possible.  They then spent that money on travelling for a few months.  Some taught on TEFOL schemes abroad and had to take courses and exams before they went.  A long time ago, my dad travelled with [VSO](http://www.vso.org.uk/) and taught engineering to students in South America - I don't know how the scheme's changed since, mind.  

Lastly, it would be a good idea to register with [LOCATE](http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/staying-safe/Locate/) when you know your plans, so heaven forbid something happen to you or in the country you're in, the embassy knows you're there and can try and get hold of you/pass information to your family and friends back home.  Make sure your emergency contacts in your passport are filled in - my cousin lost his while travelling, but it was recovered through phonecalls to his parents via their phone number in the back cover.  Keep a copy of your itinerary back home with your family and another in the cloud (Dropbox, Google Drive, even in your email acount) in case your hard copy with you goes missing or gets damaged.  Make sure you have travel insurance, and that it covers everything you might do - things like skiing, waterskiing and other extreme sports often aren't covered by default, and if you have an accident it could prove horrifically expensive.  It's not worth violating the laws of wherever you are if you run out of money too - no matter how much you need the cash don't carry suitcases or items for anyone you meet over there around or across borders, and be very very careful if you want to work cash-in-hand, as you can be thrown out of the country and banned from visiting again or worse if you get caught.

I must admit that I haven't studied the regulation in any great detail, but regulating ""the press"" in this current time of massive organisational and technological upheaval strikes me as being fraught with danger.

Perhaps this will all be skilfully negotiated by crack teams of media lawyers and legislators, but I can't say I'm holding out much hope in that regard.

What I meant by ""what is more important is what types of players on the pitch"" is for the formation itself. If you claim we play a 4-2-3-1, without pointing out that the player in the hole is a striker or midfielder, then you have misled and are using that formation too casually. If you want to casually throw that formation around, then it is more correct to state we play a 4-4-2 in that there are two strikers on the pitch.

My example was the 4-2-3-1 commonly played by Benitez with a lone Torres and no striker but rather Gerrard as an attacking midfielder, versus our formation vs. the Saints with Suarez playing behind Sturridge. 

And that's important from a defensive standpoint. Benitez's 4-2-3-1 was much more defensive from the extra midfielder. BR's is more attacking with two strikers.",0,1363621776,null,0,false,0,c8xufg8,t3_1aeycc,t1_c8xufg8,t1_c8x6ss9,null,1431623800,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Dembele has shown that he is pretty competent on the flanks and  Siggy(Holtby)/Bale/Dembele midfield trio could work well since they can all revolve and switch positions.

I want **Townsend** back next year. I was sad to see him go initially (though, I agreed that it was the best move), but he is great cover for both wings (especially for Lennon). Currently, we are REALLY missing speed down the right hand side of the field, and Townsend definitely can provide us with that.

""OHPLD"" **Rose** I believe is surplus to requirements. Jan V has shown himself to be a (much) more than competent replacement for BAE if needed, and with the depth at CB, Vert can scoot over to LB flawlessly. Further, as everyone else has mentioned, Rose has admitted several times that he doesn't want to be a bench-warmer, and considering his form for the Black Cats as of late, I say sell high. We could use that money better than to retain a superfluous player who would rather be elsewhere anyways.

As for **Pritchard**, a high-level Championship/low-level EPL loan would do wonders for him/us. It would suss out whether he is capable of making it in the big leagues, but consequently, it would put him in front of more eyes. We are overrun with CMs and CAMs right now, so a couple seasons of loans could see him improve, otherwise, I say sell. The same goes for **Obika**.

The newspapers shamelessly deploy their (apparently captive) audience and their ability to make shit up with impunity, to benefit people who act in their favour, or punish those who go against them:

**The people who decide about press regulation**:

* Individual politicians - David Mellor said during the last inquiry into media abuses, in 1991, that the popular press was 'drinking at the last chance saloon'. Within 18 months the tabloids had published a sex scandal about him, including [lurid details which were fabricated](http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2002/nov/03/features.review17).

* Political parties - Blair came to power on a wave of euphoria which was puffed up by the tabloids, and pioneered a style of government which was very tabloid-friendly. You really have to be very trusting not to wonder why Cameron appointed Andy Coulson, former editor of the NOTW, as his press officer, or to think that perhaps Andy Coulson was operating in that role with split loyalties.

**The people who decide whether they get prosecuted**

* The police - Justice in Britain works through a chain of responsibilities. The police must decide to investigate, and the CPS must decide to prosecute. The higher echelons of the police are effectively politicians, and rely on public support for promotion, and to be able to put their platforms into force. Anyone who thinks that police officers have never shied away from going after the tabloids because of worries about their reputation, is a fool. Compare the way in which the Mellor affair was reported, with [how John Yates' extra-marital affair was reported](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1211563/Yates-Yard-splits-wife.html). This is the John Yates who reviewed the phone hacking evidence (but didn't really, as it turned out), and decided no further investigation was necessary. Less about Chelsea shirts and toe-sucking, more about the pressure of his job, and what an excellent police officer he is. He is now an adviser to the Bahraini government, and [soft-soaps them while they torture protestors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Yates_%28police_officer%29#Advisor_to_Bahrain). Another police officer was given a column in a Murdoch paper post-retirement. Another was given a free holiday.

He said some rather disparaging things about the club, the players, and the fans (he called our players cheats, and that Liverpool fans didn't need plastic flags to create an atmosphere, for example).
He also once reportedly said in relation to managing Chelsea: 'I would never take that job'.

Rafa used the Chelsea job as a means to an end, he wanted to put himself in the shop window for the summer.

Any ""relevant publisher"" (which is defined in a very broad way, and could cover blogs) could form an ""independent regulator"" to regulate themselves. This regulator could then apply to be recognised by the Panel, and would have to show that it was sufficiently independent and was actually regulating the relevant publishers.

That's it.

So... this isn't supposed to create new laws to control the press. The idea is that parts of the press will replace the PCC with a new regulator which is actually independent and actually regulates them (unlike the PCC, which ended up being more of a trade group/lobbyists *for* the press). The Recognition Panel will then keep an eye on it, and let it know if it is doing its job.

The Panel will not have the power to impose a Regulator on anyone, remove it, or change the way it works. It only ""recognises"" it if it is working, or refuses to recognise it (or de-recognises it?) if it isn't.

The use of a Royal Charter is so that this is not a ""law"" (or Act of Parliament). This makes everything a bit more complicated and confusing.


**Why the Press don't like this**

Firstly, parts of the press don't want to be regulated. They like being able to break the law at will and act disreputably to get or sell a story. This *might* limit their ability to do that. But if they don't set up a regulator, and don't join it, they'd still be fine. Even if they did have an ineffective regulator like the PCC, the only negative effect would be the lack of recognition by the Panel.

Secondly, this could be expanded. In the Defamation Bill we've already been given a clue as to [how this could work](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/lbill/2012-2013/0084/lbill_2012-20130084_en_2.htm#pb2-l1g2); new rules could be introduced to allow Courts to consider things like available arbitration services, or compliance with regulators when awarding costs or damages in cases. This could make it far more expensive for newspapers to defend themselves in court (if they don't play nicely). However, this isn't a huge departure from the current law as Courts are already able to take into account things like this in some circumstances.",0,1363624352,null,0,false,0,c8xv6tb,t3_1aimxq,t1_c8xv6tb,t3_1aimxq,null,1431624179,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Argentina knows this and so knows it has about 10 years left until the Falkland Islands become their own country and then won't be able to demand them back, because that would be illegal under UN law, you can't just demand to own another UN country.

When the Falkland Islands becomes an independent country in the UN, then the South American countries won't be allowed to play silly games like they are currently by preventing Falkland Islands ships docking at South American ports, and this is a big issue for the Falkland Islands because they need somewhere close for big ships to dock to sell the oil they are beginning to drill.

The more I think about it the more I think this is a terrible idea.  If I write blog post about science does that make me a publisher.  It is not thought through at all.

There are plenty of perfectly respectable publications and people of various persuations  who think that Levinson is a terrible idea.  Ian Hislop was very anti press regulation.  

I am happy with the Spectator position, but extended to the internet too:

&gt; newspapers and other print media are subject to the rule of law but specific laws for the press should remain the tools of authoritarian not democratic and rights-abiding states.

- I don't really know the prevalence of applicant tracking software in the UK, I imagine large companies use it, however normally they don't want a resume like in the USA, they want a longer CV or for you to fill out their own application form, this may reduce its necessity. 
- Most companies (all companies?) in the UK don't drug test, I am not sure on the legality of drug testing in the UK but it isn't done often
- In the case of background checks it is possible that a company searches for the wrong person and a lot of places you have to consent to a CRB and won't get the job if you don't
- It is illegal for an employer to judge you based on your Facebook page due to discrimination laws, not that your Facebook page should be publicly available anyway. 
- As for not having a job stopping you from getting a job, this is generally true, why hire someone who is out of the loop when there is someone else who is used to the daily slog, I think a greater problem with gaining any decent job will be someone will have more experience than you and you aren't gaining any without a job. 

Overall I wouldn't say it was particularly relevant.

true,lemonmylyman,1953,,"I will be glad to see Benitez go, though mostly for tactical/structural reasons rather than specific hatred due to past events.

Just some contextual background info: 

* I was/am an AVB fan. I thought his sacking will come back in some counterfactual form in the future. I like managers with specific plans and visions.  He had one. Like Ole G. Solskjaer he loved FM. Any manager who also played hardcore FM generally have a vision for the club. I wanted this vision to get a few years.
* I liked Mourinho, I liked Hiddink, I disliked Scolari, and to a small extent Ancelotti (his sacking made sense unless Chelsea wanted to enter into a status quo ala AC Milan). 
* RDM I liked for personal/footballing reasons, but not as a tactician. I wanted him to keep the job until the end of the season (out of politeness, which is generally a terrible reason) but simultaneously had mentally prepared myself for a mediocre year with the CWC as a highlight and maybe a 4th place CL finish.

Now, onto Benitez:

**The Good** - He shore up our defense. It was definitely a must. He should get some plaudits for this; we have one of the best defenses in the league now because of him. Doesn't always work, but he told Hazard to track back and the Belgian looks to be coming around.

**The Bad** - We went from being a top 3 team to watch entertainment-wise to being as dull as Sunderland at times. It's really tragic. It gets to the point I'd rather play 7 goal thrillers and have 3 heart-attacks than fall asleep. Goes without saying. We've had some amazing individual performances from Mata and (to a lesser extent) Hazard/Oscar/Moses this year, but as a team the front six has looked disjointed the last few months.

**The Ugly** - Tactically he is not the best manager for a club like Chelsea, both in the short term or the long term. Basically, he is a manager who struggles to handle large egos and squad rotation. Only in 1 season at Liverpool did they manage to compete on both the CL + PL stages simultaneously. Usually Liverpool would be out of the league by February, he'd then play a reserve team in the league and focus all his attentions on the CL. This has been evident at Chelsea, as well. Under Benitez we have never managed to string a set of results together. In 2013 our best run has stretched 3 games and that included victories over the mighty Brentford, Sparta Prague, and Wigan Athletic. While we may not have the squad to compete for 5 trophies, I would not trust Benitez in the future to bring in the players to do so either (not that he'd be allowed). The fear is that with minimal preparation (as in, this is not *his* team) he might struggle to make CL qualification if he concentrates on getting to the final of the two cups. 

Basically we need Mourinho in for 3 years to whip us into shape and ease us through the transition period with a few trophies and an EPL title at the end of it. He can then go manage Portugal after they fuck up 2016 Euro Qualification, just in time for Klopp to want a new challenge after slapping around Pep (or getting slapped around?) for a few years.",0,1363629562,null,0,false,0,c8xwwau,t3_1aivrh,t1_c8xwwau,t3_1aivrh,null,1431624908,12,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,12

I appreciate what you are saying about leaving the Euro, however I personally have doubts as to whether many countries should have been allowed in to start with, Greece being a prime example.

I don't think keeping them in the Euro is the answer, it seems like papering over the cracks rather than addressing the root cause of the problem.

Again, this is only my opinion, but for years and years and years I've read of predictions about how the Euro cannot work and broadly speaking they have all manifested in one shape or form.

I'm not an economist so certainly don't want to get into a big debate, but from my admittedly limited view, it does look like an extremely botched implementation of a single currency.

I wouldn't be surprised to see it continue or fail. Politically so many leaders are wedded to it. On the other hand the population at large seems to be questioning it more than ever before.

Either way though, I think it will be extremely unpleasant for a lot of people which is a real tragedy.

If you actually believe it was about  finding weapons of mass destruction, then I'm sorry, but you're simply stupid, ignorant, and the kind of person who gets their face pissed on and believe it's raining.

Some little-known facts:

1. [Saddam Hussein was the West's friend during the 80s.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_support_for_Iraq_during_the_IranâIraq_war)

2. [We, the United Kingdom, paid for a chlorine factory in Iraq that was used for manufacturing mustard gas.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_chemical_weapons_program#The_1980s_program) Much of Iraq's international chemical weapon equipment was of German origin. Private American suppliers, licensed by the U.S. government, exported biological and chemical materials to Iraq (to be used against the Iranians during their war). Countless other countries knowingly (and willingly) supplied Iraq with chemical and biological weapons, or at least the materials to make them.

3. [The U.S. provided Saddam with intelligence that was used in Iraq's aggression against Iran, despite knowing that they were clearly using chemical and biological agents against Iranian soldiers in that war.](http://www.iranchamber.com/history/articles/arming_iraq.php)

4. Iraq was allowed to purchase batches of anthrax, West Nile fever, gas gangrene, etc. [The CDC was shipping germ cultures directly to the Iraqi weapons facility in al-Muthanna.](http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=us_iraq_80s_841)

I don't want to end up writing a dissertation on this particular subject, but simply put, Iraq was a monster that **WE** created, but looked the other way when he used chemical weapons on people.

I think they should be British, because I think the events that led them to fall under UK control happened long ago enough that, since nobody involved or anyone who could be said to be associated with them, is alive any more, and it wouldn't be fair to the people who live there, just for the sake of a symbolic international dispute.

I don't know, or care, whether ""the land"" is Argentine.

edit: I forgot, just to make it clear. While I think they should remain British I think the referendum is a bit of a sham from what I said before.

true,cylinderhead,null,null,"My experience as a recruiter in the UK:

#6. One Screwed-Up Interview Can Land You on a Blacklist
True. There won't be an actual list, that would be legally irresponsible. It's an anecdotal blacklist and you only go on it if you really mess up. If you say in an interview that you work on ""you time"" and don't work on ""corporate time"" (it happened), I, one of my colleagues, or my friends who work at other companies will remember your name for years to come. 

#5. No Human Will Ever See Your Resume Before It Goes into the Trash

False. Most application systems will let the applicant know if they don't meet the bare minimum criteria. Before I see it, it will have been screened for applicants who think they meet the minimum but don't. So a human will see it, just not a human who's going to make the ultimate decision about whether to interview or not.

#4. A Saint Could Take Your Drug Test and Still Fail

False. Drug tests? Really? Americans. Maybe if you're applying to SOCA. 

#3. Their Background Check May Turn Up Crimes You Didn't Commit

False. Unless you need a [DBS check](http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/agencies-public-bodies/dbs/) (used to be CRB/ISA), your employer is unlikely to have access to that kind of information. It's much more likely that someone will Google your name (and your email address, with its linked social media accounts etc), and if your name comes up in the local newspaper site, that might be bad for you.

#2. They're Checking Your Facebook Profile for Party Pics and Spelling Errors

True. And your Twitter account. Anything. If you have things on any social media site you don't want traced back to you, make sure you have your privacy settings right, you use a different email for job applications and social media, and that the first thing that comes up on Google for your name and town isn't a MySpace profile implying that you're never sober.

I was unaware that an MP is inherently obliged to respond to letters, I thought they just simply would avoid them.  So, if I wrote to an MP on workfare, am I invariably granted a reply?

Violence is very much akin to a surgeon hacking away at a patient's body to repair some damage, as a quick effort to resolve the problem.  The doctor may be impatient and unwilling to try other avenues of cure/treatment, but it still solves the problem nonetheless albeit quicker also.  Perhaps violence is the quick and easy path to resolution.  While I do prefer peaceful diplomatic solutions, peaceful diplomatic neglect certainly seems equally likely.  If the people fight with words, then those in power merely have to ignore them for the people will just keep fighting with words.  It very seems akin to a people fighting a tank with sticks and stones.  The tank won't react, unless you begin fighting with tools that actually have an impact on the tank.  So what I'm suggesting is that to fight those in power, you must use tools which actually have an impact on them -- something to excite the fear from within (it doesn't really matter of what, just so long as equilibrium is found).

I'd like to vote but I can't see how that could work either.  Those of contemporary power stated that they would help all but have lied just as before.

2) Taarabt, Benteke and ANDY CARROLL ahead of Hazard?

3) Mata isn't even in the 'top 20' players in the PL

4) Chicho (who?) for Swansea is allegedly the 6th best player in the league.

I was glued to the set, and through my local library I discovered this mass of history via Target novelisations, including other men playing the same character. When the season drew to a close my parents humoured my interest via video rentals of early BBC releases and then that holy grail: A trip to the Longleat Exhibit. That was what really hooked me in. I was in the Tardis, a menagerie of monsters on all sides! By the time of season 26 I was we'll versed in a (somewhat) potted history of the show, and even after its cancellation I never gave up hope it would rise again. My interest has come and gone over the years, but I have never stopped loving the show. I see a lot of fans of the classic era poop upon Moffat, RTD et all, but as long as some 7 or 8 year old  gets their imagination fired up by the program, I will continue to love it now as I did then.

true,ThatAwkwardBiscuit,null,null,"First things first I'm a little bit baffled as both a worker in a job centre and as someone signing on. Are you a new signer? Because I have never heard of someone going weekly. Every day if you are homeless but it's fortnightly for everyone else. Also why would you walk to the job centre if there is a technology problem? They won't be able to do anything for you apart from book you an appointment for the employment zone which to be honest will never be on the same day. It's best to go to a library. 

Secondly I'll re say what I've said somewhere else. It is not one person who sanctions you. There is a chain from Band B (your signer) to the benefit centre where it can be stopped any time. Most staff only sanction when there is a reason too, I've seen people get away with the most barefaced lies. They look at your activity per week. For example I have 6 things per week as on my job seekers agreement so they will look for 6 things per week despite the things aren't every day and it is triple that number. I do know however that they are now looking for about 30 hours per week job search. It is your job to find you a job if you know what I mean. A real bugger when you are on a wex placement! If there is something you are unhappy about on your agreement, change it. It is a contract that you have agreed to and signed. If you don't understand something, ask them and clarify everything. They aren't there to trick you... unless you get a prat of an employee.

They have started an online record because you wouldn't believe how many times people say they have left their job search at xyz and expect me the work experience girl to magic one out of no where. 

Thirdly.  Even though they are pushing UJM, you don't have to use it. If you want keep a spreadsheet or the grey booklet as your job search then that is ok. To be honest whilst the kinks of UJM are being sorted it'll make your life a hell of a lot easier for now. They will not have a go at you for going to other places to look for jobs. Remind them to look at the activity section. UJM's job search function is bloody awful and staff know this and it's not their fault. They didn't create the bugger. DWP computers are awfully slow, it used to take me 20 minutes to get some life into my computer. 

Fouthly I've had a glass of red wine so this may not make much sense.

Quite why I don't know, because laws are already in place criminalising phone hacking, with much brought to court already.

The press are opposed to new statute, because they see it as encroaching on a free press. And it's not just the ""journalists"" that target footballers, or Milly Dowler's family that are opposed to parliamentary oversight. Broadsheets and local papers too. Real journalists don't target celebrities and victims for a juicy scoop, rather they target politicians. 

That's the crux of it - giving politicians power to impose limits on the press, and to decide what they can and cannot report, sets a dangerous precedent and goes against the entire philosophy of a free press; of holding the powers that be to account. It's seen as a creeping tyranny, which was the argument made in my local Echo today.

Amy is the companions when they are brand new. She makes mistakes, she's not typically the one to save the day, she's naive, and she's in love with the Doctor (or has trouble seeing him as anything other than amazing).

Rory is the companion at the mid-point of their development. He's actively trying to help, he's still not 100% confident, he has some knowledge, however he's able to step up when needed.

River is the companion at the end. She's confident, she's capable by herself, she's constantly saving the day, and she has tons of knowledge.

Ahh I see I didn't know you have to sign on when you go past the 2 years. I'm hitting 9 months and I've heard them trialling just the once a month sign on in our district. Different places seem to be on their own train doing different things then which isn't that surprising.  I'm not sure how that sanction could be justified to the benefit centre when you are reaching you're required actions. Onne signer told me she didn't have access to UJM two weeks ago which she should definitely have and I had to give verbal evidence. 

To be honest IAD is soo busy with doing CVs and showing people how to get on to the system and email address, I'd just go with the library and you'll get some peace and quiet there if there are any issues. The computers use linux and at least are speedy than the normal DWP computers but you only get the hour. When people were having issues with the site, we'd send em up stairs and they're just be told to ring a number which was useless. 

When I did the training for UJM they told us you don't have to use it and definitely not mandatory. After all you have to give them permission to see your job search on UJM.

All our wide players have been pretty disappointing, which has especially been a concern to a team that relies on balls into the box as a primary method of chance creation. 

Joe Cole has been such a revelation because he can offer genuine quality delivery into the box. For a team set up trying to score the way we are at the moment our delivery from wide areas and dead balls seemed lacking before Joe came home.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Heh, you are not wrong. I know it's the opposite of the popular opinion on reddit, but I also think financial regulation is a huge mess. The system is far too complex to have a bunch of un-trained non-experts introduce the rules that govern it. Even the actual experts disagree on how basic financial processes work. 

Rules create imbalances and regulation breeds monopoly (I think, anyway). It costs an absolute fortune to comply with government regulation in finance - I mean, let's look at an example of taxation. Some of the largest (and most profitable) organisations in the UK and the world are accountants. The tax system in the UK is hilariously complicated - there are disagreements in tax law all the time, which is why all large companies have to have entire departments devoted to accountancy, and hire outside firms to provide further advice. What do accountants and tax lawyers produce? What is their net contribution to the world? Nothing. Billions of pounds are spent quibbling over tens of billions of pounds - the system is so ridiculously complex that there are 'loopholes' all over the place. People take advantage of these loopholes. What I would argue for is a drastic simplification in the system, rather than  the view that you could simply increase the amount of complexity until all of the 'loopholes' are gone - if such a thing could ever happen (and remember at the same time you're increasing the need for accountants and tax workers, that have no production). 

Tax is not my thing, but just for talking points sake - imagine a system with a flat tax on everything. Say a flat sales tax. It's paid on everything you buy, once, and that's that - you eliminate pretty much all of the possible routes for people to cleverly position themselves to not pay tax. Rich people pay more tax because they buy more things. At the same time, the billions of pounds spent on accountancy, the existence of HMRC and a whole bunch of other organisations can just be wiped out. Those people can move into actually producing something for the world. As it is, we have a badly designed farce of a system where people can pay tax 3, 4 or 5 times on the one purchase. And if the government has given us something so ridiculous in the first place, I don't see why we should trust them to suddenly give us something better should we give them more power.

* My first theory is sort of obvious I think. We know that the doctor is the last Time Lord and he is the one responsible for the death of 2 races (3 counting the vampire episode) and we also know that after 900 something years its starting to get to him a little bit. So my theory is that what the Doctor wants more than anything in the universe is to die, but he knows that he has a responsibility to live because not only is he the last time lord but also every other episode he has to stop some race from destroying some other race. This is supported in a few episodes such as ""Lets Kill Hitler"" where he is on the ground talking to hologram Amelia and he just collapses with his eyes closed you can see a slight smile on his face. The other way that it is supported is that EVERY SINGLE EPISODE he is put in some life threatening situation that he just barely escapes even though it seems as if he goes places by random. HE'S TAKING THEM TO THE MOST DANGEROUS PLACES IN THE UNIVERSE SO THAT HE CAN DIE but he won't just let himself die.

true,britishtwat,eng-northhamptonshire,The Northampton(shire) Clown,"""On 13 June 2012, Ashworth was serving as part of 1st Battalion of The Royal Anglian Regiment. He was on a patrol in the Nahri Saraj District of Helmand Province, Afghanistan. He was leading a fire-team, clearing out compounds, when his team came under fire from Taliban armed with rifles and rocket-propelled grenades from several mud huts. Ashworth charged the huts, providing cover for his team who followed in single file behind him. After his fire-team took out most of the insurgents, Ashworth pursued the final remaining member. He crawled forward under cover of a low wall while his team provided covering fire and acted as a diversion. When he got within 5 metres (16 ft) of the enemy, he was killed as he attempted to throw a grenade. Captain Mike Dobbin said of Ashworth, ""His professionalism under pressure and ability to remain calm in what was a chaotic situation is testament to his character. L/Cpl Ashworth was a pleasure to command and I will sorely miss his calming influence on the battlefield. Softly spoken, he stepped up to every task thrown in his direction."" After his death, his body taken to Camp Bastion and was then repatriated to the United Kingdom.""

I am 100% super-happy with the care I have had from the NHS except from the food (and when you're stuck in a hospital bed mealtimes are one of the few things to look forward to).  And the food in the hospital when I had my baby was not bad (it was an area with a high Indian population, so the veggie option was lovely curry).  When I broke my ankle in a less multicultural area the food was genuinely horrible (TMI alert - opiates make you constipated.  Large quantities of cheese won't help).  But I wouldn't back paying out of pocket for better food.  People in hospital are generally not there by choice and generally recovering from something.

Townsend is looking great so I'd absolutely be bringing him back to play an important back-up role, maybe push Lennon a little for the right-wing spot, or even a regular starting place on the left if Bale continues to play in the centre.

Carroll I'd like to see get a PL loan - I know we need a back-up to Dembele but I think that by the start of next summer we could be using Holtby in such a role alongside Sandro/Parker if needed, and a year of regular play would do Carroll a lot of good. The biggest trouble is finding a club that will be able to give him that and not be too scared to use him in the centre because of his size. If Wigan were to stay up and Martinez doesn't leave I think that would be a great place to send him.

A PL loan for Pritchard would also be great, I think he's pretty much in the same boat as Carroll and it'd be great to see what he can do with a regular starting berth.

I still really can't see Kane working out so I'd be fine with selling him, but finding him a top-flight loan to give him another season to show what he can do wouldn't be such a bad thing - he didn't really get a chance at Norwich this year with his injury problems, and he's still young and could add plenty yo his game yet.

This reminds me of when my teenage step-brother tries to talk to me online, his common defense is ""wut? not lik u cnt red it?"" and says that it's just ""how ppl tak dees days."" He said that I'm nitpicking because I'm trying to deny him of being who he is, etc. What I'm trying to do is uphold the standard of the English language.

How that translates to Doctor Who, at the risk of coming off VERY hipster-ish (Whovian purist?), the show we have now is not the show we had 2005-2009. It's not Doctor envy, it's just that when I got into the show (Eccelston, 2005) I really enjoyed it, found that it was imaginative yet still based in reality (to an extent, commonly the human element and ability to evoke emotions and thoughts that resonate in most of us). How I defined ""Doctor Who"" in my life, the impact or place that it held/holds, that differs from what the show offers today.

I'm sure your friends are intelligent people with great taste. I think the show is easier to get into now than it may have been in the past. I think it suffers a little as a result, though. I never considered it the epitome of sci-fi/fantasy, but it was far from ""mainstream"" televised entertainment. What I've observed since Moffat/Smith started is the show (and BBC America) gradually moving closer and closer toward ""mainstream"" in hopes of attaining a wider audience. That's fine, but it's doing it at the cost of losing its unique character and depth. If you look at the ""scary"" episodes of Doctor Who (I'm talking 2005 to present) I think most people would list them in nearly chronological order. ""The Empty Child,"" ""Blink,"" and ""Silence in the Library"" would all be near the top of the list. They weren't afraid to be scary. They had more imagination. They also weren't easily resolved or written off. More specifically, the Weeping Angels have been far less intimidating since 2009 than they were in ""Blink."" Some would say this is because they were knew in ""Blink"" and by the time other episodes featured them we already knew who they were. It ends up becoming like 80's horror villains (Freddy, Jason, etc) where people tune in not to be afraid of the monsters but to somewhat root for them. (I'm getting side-tracked...)

**tl;dr** - I fully admit that my RTD ""bias"" over Moffat is primarily due to my discovering the show during that time. As a result, I have not been as satisfied by Moffat's offerings but I keep tuning in each week with hopes that the next episode may possibly recapture what I once knew the show to be.",0,1363664061,null,0,false,0,c8y9bbp,t3_1aj9bj,t1_c8y9bbp,t1_c8y90d2,null,1431630960,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

It would have to be truly enormous, because VAT is currently only about 15% of total government revenue, so say, 100% VAT. That is going to create a massive incentive for people to avoid the tax. You'd have a whole new generation of smugglers, people bringing in iPhones in yachts into Cornwall, and to regulate that (or to attempt and fail to regulate that) you'd require an enormously large and expensive customs service. There would also be bizarre distortions, so that everything consumer-faced would suddenly become much more expensive, relative to labour.

It also seems to be that capitalism tends towards imbalance and monopoly without any help from regulation. You can argue about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in America, but in general housing booms are a natural part of the system, caused by greed and over-exuberance.

Moffat tends to write more subtle and RTD was generally blunt. Moffat is more fear based and RTD was more 60's scifi camp. It's just different styles. The style changes with every show runner, I think that throws a lot of the fan base since they didn't come in before the reboot (I didn't either, in fact I started watching it after I saw Miracle Day of all things.) 

Personally I prefer Moffat, maybe because I like River and convoluted timelines and the fact that he writes for a general audience (even then the references to Classic Who are everywhere) doesn't bother me(continuity lockout kills tv shows anyway). Maybe it's all the horror, or maybe because I don't consider any of the episodes of Moffats run difficult to re watch as I do a good chunk of RTD's (Though that's probably more my dislike of 10 more than anything, love David, can't stand 10). Even then I don't hate Davies run, it's just not my favourite thing to watch.

It hasn't even really declined in depth, I wouldn't say it's deeper or more shallow, it's just presented differently. like one pool was painted blue and the other red. 

I've seen the same arguments against Davies that people use against Moffat, can't even take it seriously anymore.

The best part of the whole argument of course though is that while the fans sometimes hate one or another, Moffat and Davies get along just fine.

Consider contacting previous employers, as well as competitors in your area. The competitors may feel that you could give them an upper hand due to your knowledge gained in the local industry.

We have a mixed run until the end of the season, five winnable games (Stoke, Sunderland, QPR, West Ham, Fulham) and four more difficult fixtures (Spurs, Arsenal, Liverpool, Chelsea). I wouldn't be surprised if we got results against the tougher teams - we tend to do so - but our major issue has been being unable to win against bottom-half opposition. That run of draws at the end of 2012 has ended up costing us badly.

It's certainly not out of the question, but I think a combination of injuries/suspensions, our overall inconsistency, and Arsenal's easy run-in will mean that we'll end up roughly where we are now.

On the other hand it's Steven Moffat.

They are about an even match. I think the reason the coach picks Benteke over Lukaku is because he is sometimes clumsy. Lukaku is a very solid player, and he relies a lot on force and his body, the only critique he gets  is that he is somethimes clumsy with the ball. That's why I would also like to see him an extra year on loan. Instead of coming back to Chelsea. He is only 19!

But I think Lukaku is on par with Benteke. We just happen to have 2 players with the same profile and our national coach does not intend to play with 2 strong force strikers at the moment.

You might see him play though. Remember, there are 2 games and Benteke already has yellow. Our national coach also loves to switch players around , which has lead to a few super subs.

Basically as she is limited to catering and other menial jobs, her income would not match the costs of childcare. I would support her either way should she work / stay at home. This works ok for us, as my wife also prefers looking after the kids instead of having someone else do this.

This new change means you can earn up to 150k a year and get a tax break, but if you make far less then that, and you have a 'traditonal' family, well you can go fuck off and you're not getting a thing.

I am serioulsy considering getting out of this country now, its like the straw that broke the camels back. I can't afford to buy a home due to the massively inflated property prices propped up by the goverment, so I have huge rents to meet with one man owning half the cul de sac where I live and renting it all out while he lives it up in florida for six months of the year - again with no help from the goverment building new afforadble homes. 

I have consistantly seen my standard of living going down and my wages frozen. I face living in poverty as a pensioner (if I make it that far) as I don't have a public pension and my private one is laughable at best (as we can't afford to pay much in). Yet every month I see a nice big slice of my salary go direct to HMRC to pay for everyone else.

Seriously, why should I bother to stay in this cold, crappy resentful country when I could be somewhere nice and warm, with a low crime and more of my own money going towards my own family and making things better for us?

Hopefully this gives me enough of a incentive to get off my arse and get the fuck out of here.",0,1363684660,null,0,1363685484,0,c8ydh73,t3_1ajgtz,t1_c8ydh73,t3_1ajgtz,null,1431632954,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Apart from Russia for 2 weeks I didn't make it out of Asia. In that two years I spent a year living in China teaching English.

I hardly missed the UK at all. In the 2 years I came back once for my brother in-law's wedding. Caught up with family and friends at the same time. With the internet keeping in contact with people back home is easy. I loved teaching and whilst the pay isn't great I was only spending half of my 660 quid a month salary each month as accommodation and bills were paid for. It helped that I had friends who lived in Beijing already, but I got along with the other teachers well and soon made plenty more friends.

Things I missed were builder's tea, cheese and wine. But there were plenty of supermarket's aimed at expats where I could get these things. Decent builder's tea (PG, Yorkshire, etc. Not Twinnings) was hard to find, I still remember the day I found a box of 160 Yorkshire tea bags hidden away in the corner of a supermarket.

One thing I could have done without was the winter, basically 4 months of -5 to -10 degrees. Though at least it was dry so you didn't need to worry about being water proof, just warm. However, you got static shocks from any metal you touched.

I came back to the UK in October 09, but have been longing to go back for ages. I've been back to visit the Uni I taught in twice and the rest of my holidays are spent in SE Asia. At the end of last year I took a course in how to teach ESL properly and now have a nice certificate from Cambridge to help me find a decent ESL teaching job.

If you write a blog or post a tweet, you *cannot* be subject to the regulator unless you have chosen to sign up to it.  I don't know how to make that clearer.  The regulator does not have jurisdiction over everyday social media.

&gt;this man in the pub marketed himself as a 'source of information' - should I be able to take him to arbitration (at his cost) for a wrong statement

If he intends for you to accept his claims as fact, and if he *publishes* them, then yes.  Stop being facetious.

&gt;this sounds very strange - they are free to join, but there are massive financial penalties if you don't (and get charged with something) and you can't see any serious publication not joining? doesn't sound so 'unforced' to me.

You're deliberately misconstruing the situation.  The fact is that there is no legal sanction for not joining.  Joining gives you the *additional benefit* of not facing punitive damages if you are sued.

Publications have every legal right to be independent of the regulator.  I simply think that they will choose to join because it is better for them if they do.  And remember that the only real difference the new regulator will really make is in terms of larger fines, more prominent corrections/apologies, and being more likely to punish publications when they break the existing code of conduct.  This isn't censorship - it's just tougher enforcement of existing voluntary press rules.

&gt;that was already illegal

Yes, and that was my point.  The average blogger will still be able to say whatever they want about whoever or whatever they choose, unless it falls foul of existing defamation laws.

The clearest indication of this is that the Tories claim victory, because there is no statutory underpinning, and Labour claim victory because there _is_ a statutory underpinning.

I think that the rough idea is:

1. Royal charter forms two bodies - one a 'self regulatory body' for 'the press', and a second body to watch the first to make sure it's not stuffed full of press men.

2. Charter gives limits to the regulatory body, which includes forcing front page apologies, and other such things.

3. Change the law so that members of 'the press' that are _not_ part of the self-regulatory body can be hit with additional, punative, fines if they are found to be 'doing wrong things' (details of these, I am missing).

I think that's the rough outline of what's ended up being proposed.


In practice, it'll take a long time (probably 5-10 years) to work out what the actual, effective, system for right now is.  I give it that long, because I don't doubt that certain aspects of the regulations will be found to contravene some other law, and thus be struck out as invalid.

Anecdotally, yes in my experience, people do think this. Just how ""they"" (the people I know) also think that the NHS ""is free"".

&gt; I've always understood that a portion of my monthly contract went on the handset.

The people I know, believe that phones are given ""for free"" to soften them up to pay a contract to use whoever's service they sign up for.  
With that payment, they use the company's services such as ""downloading from the net"", picture messaging and so on.

So when they ""buy"" a phone, in their mind, it goes like this:

* Who can give me the best phone ""for free"".
* Am I going to use all the features the company is offering me for the price I'm going to need to pay (for the service, not the phone).",0,1363697103,null,0,false,0,c8yf1am,t3_1al0yh,t1_c8yf1am,t1_c8ydvhd,null,1431633678,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I got out here on a family visa, my dad's job moved here and I was able to nab a place on his visa so I figured I might as well since I'd been planning on coming out here on a work holiday visa anyway, plus job market is shit at home and I hadn't got a proper 'career' job yet so it wasn't like I had much to lose ditching an assistant manager job at a convenience store. 

I want to stay here as I'm a tad worried about how the UK economy is going, my current earnings and earning potential here is much higher than back home even if cost of living is slightly higher. Plus its sunny as balls! All the time! Apart from when it's raining, but when it rains it storms with lightning and shit which is pretty cool!

Relocation was ok, even though I didn't pay for it I did end up sorting a lot of it out, since my dad had to leave pronto and left me + the mothership to sort it out, as a family of four we comfortably moved all our stuff in 2 20ft shipping crates for ~Â£7000, but I think it would have been cheaper if it was one 40ft crate. No serious issues with any of that, although the cats were quite traumatised by the move which was sad but they're cool now! And love catching lizards instead of mice! The flights were a bitch but that was more family drama than 23 hours of planes. 

I do miss the UK a bit, mostly friends and family and ironically Foster's beer (standard lager here is a bit shit). Ultimately I currently really enjoy it here and don't see that changing so I feel this is a good opportunity for me, when I get permanent residency and then citizenship I might move back to the UK for a bit if a good job offer does appear but I think I prefer it down under.

That said, as time goes on I do find I miss the UK more, I have been back almost every year for some reason or another, most recently on an internship.

If I regret anything it's probably going to the university I went to, which I don't think is very good. If I could go back and choose with the knowledge I have now, I would have gone to uni in the UK. But I can't complain, I have traveled, learned a new language.

the regulator can punish ""a website containing news-related material (whether or not related to a newspaper or magazine)"" (twitter/facebook) where some ""targets an audience primarily in the United Kingdom"" and relates to ""news or information about public affairs"" or ""opinion about matters relating to the news or current affairs.""

Don't tell me you cannot get that to apply to twitter/fb/my individual blog/whatever. 

&gt; If he intends for you to accept his claims as fact, and if he publishes them, then yes. Stop being facetious.

the only difference being he doesn't type it, he speaks it. perhaps the british pub will be the last true bastion of 'free speech' in the UK. 

&gt;  The fact is that there is no legal sanction for not joining. Joining gives you the additional benefit of not facing punitive damages if you are sued.

punitive damages are a coercion, so this is hardly a free choice. If you choose not to join, and someone makes a complaint against you, you face bankruptcy. This does not just apply to big newspapers, but small [local newspapers](http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2013/mar/19/press-regulation-local-newspapers-rush-compensation?CMP=twt_fd) and may apply to websites/bloggers too. 

&gt; And remember that the only real difference the new regulator will really make is in terms of larger fines, more prominent corrections/apologies, and being more likely to punish publications when they break the existing code of conduct. 

in other words, the ability to put news providers out of business at the drop of a hat.

&gt;  The new regulator will not apply to them unless they voluntarily sign up to it. Life for these people will go on exactly as it does now.

Most machines have a cotton/non-coloured wash, which is a higher temperature and is useful for properly dirty clothes and a coloured wash, which is good for... pretty much anything else. Never wash any *new* clothes with anything lighter than them for the first couple of washes. New jeans can be leaky motherfuckers, and probably should be washed alone the first time or two you wash 'em. 

When you fill the machine with clothes, don't stuff it 100% full. Leave some room so the clothes can be agitated properly. Seen some people at uni do monthly washes and fall foul of that one. 

Other common programmes, is one for delicates (probably not important until you're washing a SO's clothes - is a cooler wash with no spin) and you can get short washes when doing tiny loads. Also usually a spin-only option - useful if you're washing a dense item and one spin wasn't enough. If you have a manual for the machine, it'll tell you what all the options do/mean. 

If you have an in-drum ball/tabs, shove in, and switch on. If not, middle drawer segment is the one for the washing powder. (first one is for prewash, usually is a 3rd for softener if you bother with it). 

Tumble-drying does cost and can shorten the life of your clothes, so wouldn't recommend unless you don't have space to dry stuff. I do rather like tumble-dried towels though.

Yeah exactly, with the house prices and transport costs it really has become what Kinnock warned about (not that he was great either):

&gt; I warn you that you will have pain â when healing and relief depend upon payment. I warn you that you will have ignorance â when talents are untended and wits are wasted, when learning is a privilege and not a right. I warn you that you will have poverty â when pensions slip and benefits are whittled away by a government that wonât pay in an economy that can't pay. I warn you that you will be cold â when fuel charges are used as a tax system that the rich don't notice and the poor can't afford.

&gt; I warn you that you must not expect work â when many cannot spend, more will not be able to earn. When they don't earn, they don't spend. When they don't spend, work dies. I warn you not to go into the streets alone after dark or into the streets in large crowds of protest in the light. I warn you that you will be quiet â when the curfew of fear and the gibbet of unemployment make you obedient. I warn you that you will have defence of a sort â with a risk and at a price that passes all understanding. I warn you that you will be home-bound â when fares and transport bills kill leisure and lock you up.

I'm 21 years old, in my second year at university, and i (fortunately) have a semi-realistic idea of Job prospects once i leave. But that's out of pure luck that I go to a small uni with a good reputation and high employability rate. If i didnt land here, i'd be as lost as everyone else i grew up with.

My knowledge of career paths pretty much ends at retail. There's the obvious jobs people do, things you see every day, emergency services, binmen, the average. But everyone i grew up with works in retail, because that's the environment we seem to have become conditioned too.

'I need a new job' means handing out your CV in the high street. It's a horrid thing to live in such ignorance that you believe your only job prospects are grinding for minimum wage for some other sucker, selling people something they dont need.

Where i'm from you do whats expected, you're either in retail, or selling drugs, or popping out babbys. But how the fuck do you break the chain?

In the past the [Commonwealth Development Corporation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Development_Corporation) did some wonderful things. But as with all great things their activities have been eroded by corruption and greed. Rather than aiding agrarian communities to become self-sustainable and to become exporters themselves, they are instead spending their investments on shopping malls and internet connections for the middle classes of dirt poor nations. That doesn't bring people out of poverty or starvation, but at least it is more profitable for investors. If you don't like the the way the money is wasted, argue instead for it to be used better. To simply do away with it entirely is morally bankrupt. Our nation was one of the worst exploiters of the third world for hundreds of years. We bear at least some part of the responsibility for many of the troubles they still face. Foreign aid is literally the least we can do to help and I think it's right to pursue it.

true,emmytee,cnty-scotland,Glasgow,"Well I bailed out of the UK for Hong Kong 2 years ago, and after teaching English for a year and various other shenanigans, I'm just starting a PhD in cancer/cell cycle type stuff out here so that will be another 3-4 years out here in all likelihood. 

I grew up in rural Scotland, so being in one of the busiest but still relatively affluent cities in the world is pretty awesome for me. The buses come once every 5 minutes or so, the subway about the same - in my hometown there was a bus every half hour and it cost a lot. The shops close about 11pm and this city really never sleeps, there are always lights flashing and always people out and about. I once counted 100(ish) people waiting to cross the road at the other side of the zebra crossing, so probably about 50% of my villages population. 

I must say that there are some things I miss from the UK - some food I can't cheaply make (cheese is probably more expensive than weed out here, and bars will charge Â£7 for a pint of John Smiths without thinking anything of it), but I don't want to stay in the UK anymore. I will return for a few years, probably to do a round of postdoc if all goes well as my GF (chinese) wants to do her PhD in the UK - but after that we're thinking maybe Canada or New Zealand. The UK doesn't (completely) suck, but when I try to list good things about it I get - Good Bars, Friends, Family. Not much else. 

I feel great about leaving the UK. I would suggest doing undergrad in the West as people here don't know how to enjoy undergrad (sleeping over banned in the student halls...), but after that I would recommend getting out if you can and have some interest in this. There is a whole lot of world out there and I would hate to have been cooped up in one grey, droopy, self pitying corner of it!

One thing I would say - don't try to force some sort of ""cultured international explorer"" persona onto yourself. Don't go and live in a village in rural tibet or something where you will probably have a shitty time in a culture which isn't interested you and doesn't really want you there. I'm not saying don't explore or don't be respectful, but sometimes you just want to go to a sports bar and watch the rugby. You will find expat communities just about everywhere, though. 

Also remember that you will never really ""get it"" in an Asian culture, and as such may have some difficulties making close local friends. Making friends who you eat food and share coffee and beer with is easy, but forging those strong bonds of friendship can be harder, sometimes it can be a little frustrating.  In my opinion its best to aim for a mix, most of my mates have ended up being either Chinese/HK with experience of the west (raised there or studied there for undergrad), or fellow expats. 

that was probably rambling but its late here, and I had a reasonable amount of sake with dinner (did I mention the food is great?)

I miss the UK a lot but whenever I'm there I remember all the rubbish sides that it's easy to forget when away from it. Either way I couldn't live down where my family are (Cornwall) due to lack of jobs/low income.

If I'm honest, this kind of vague question about charities and similar organisations spending money is a bit of a bugbear for me. This kind of thing has to spend money in order to achive their stated goals.

That said, ""Enough Food For Everyone IF"" appears to be a campaign, rather than a charity, sponsored by a broad group of 100+ charities [""according to their size""](http://enoughfoodif.org/faqs#funding). I can't find a charity number on their website, meaning they're probably not one, and I'm not entirely sure of how they operate and to what ends. I've never heard of them and I don't really care. It's just another campaigning/lobbying group. 

It says they'll publish a full funding report at the end of their campaign so we don't know how much money they have right now, but [given the size of the organisations involved here](http://enoughfoodif.org/who-we-are) we can assume the campaign is fairly well funded.

I guess in this case the suits could have been hired from or donated by a corporate partner, hired commercially, supplied by individual participants, etc... But the point I'm making, badly, is that the expense for 500 suits and masks, relative to the likely size of this campaign, the awareness they're raising and the potential for future fundraising/campaigning off the back of this, is nothing at all.

- Get the tourist bus (you can haggle them down on price if it's quiet) and ""do"" all the sights. It's hop on, hop of and you could probably cover the major postcard things in an afternoon.

- Go to street markets (not the ones in the town centre). The antiques and bric-a-brac market at the place du Jeu de Balle are OK but a bit touristy and priced accordingly. Do a web search for 'brocante bruxelles' or 'braderie' and go to those. They're fun. Also, the MarchÃ© du Midi at the south station on a Sunday is awesome.

- Cinema. there's loads of it everywhere. There's a drive-in at the Parc Cinquantenaire in the summer, and many independent places: Arenberg, Nova, Cinematek. All year round you're never far away from a film festival. Next moth is my fave - the BIFFF (fantasy and horror from around the world). there are literally dozens, honestly. Don't go to Kenepolis unless you want watery cola and overpriced everything.

- Food: You can have anything you want. If you can think of a cuisine,it's almost certainly here. Be a tourist and go for the fites with fricadelle and special sauce at Maison Antoine on the Place Jourdan. Your arteries won't thank me but they are superb.

- Drink: Again, spoiled for choice. For something a bit different (and interesting) do a tour of the Cantillon brewery. To try the best Lambic (artisan) beer in town , A la Becasse near the Grand'Place is a must. You will need to wait for a seat as a rule. Be careful - some of these beers are subtle and deadly!

- Art: Visit the home of Horta, see the Magritte collection. Sounds obvious but both are well worth it. Go to the tourist office and ask them for a sheet on the murals of Brussels. You can spend a nice morning walking around looking at things painted on the side of houses. The tram to the Atomium brings up some surprisingly good graffiti art too. 

- Shopping. Ask my wife.

- Don't: Bother with Mini-Europe. It's crap and really expensive. Don't go to English/Irish bars. There are literally thousands of bars in this town - pick one you fancy and take a chance. At the very worst, you'll get a well-kept beer. Don't do anything stupid and touristy.

true,SpacklesTheWonderCat,eng-berkshire,Berkshire | 'MURICA,"I live in the USA. I never really did much of anything in school, combination of lack of interest myself and the school itself being terrible. I left at 16 with 10 GCSEs but that's about it. Shortly after my family moved from Berks to Dorset and I found myself with my only access to the outside world being a dial up internet connection. A mate of mine from back home got me to add this one girl on msn he knew and she just happened to be from the USA.

We chatted a lot and we ended up online dating. After a little while I started working temp jobs until I had a few grand and then flying to spend 10-12 weeks in the USA with her. Eventually the distance became insurmountable  and we decided to start the process of getting me a proper visa with a view to eventually getting a green card. It took 22 months, multiple cock-ups by the US government, one split up and me flying there to mend things up between us before it was finally done.

I've lived here and been married to her 5 years now. I have to say that I sometimes question my own logic. Yes there were people that told me that I would never amount to anything in life, and yes there were people that dismissed it as just as silly online dating, but is it really any better? I get to see my family and friends once a year, the weather IS nicer, but sometimes I'd prefer a muggy, overcast 20c Berkshire summer's day over a 39c humid heat death day that we get here.

Also the food is shit. I mean it tastes wonderful, all of it, but its absolutely awful for you, and overall its because it is cheaper to just buy fast food than do a grocery shop. But on top of all of this, my one absolute biggest gripe about the entire country, is that the car is king. I love driving, don't get me wrong, but unless you live right in the middle of the city, you have absolutely no choice about whether you drive or not because everything is so spaced apart. There is no ""pop to the shop for a loaf of bread and some milk"" because it involves you getting in your car, driving for 10 minutes and dealing with the traffic, then trying to find a parking space, then wandering around some gigantic superstore where bread is at one end and milk is at the other, 1/4 of a mile away, then repeat the ordeal in opposite on the way home and it ends up taking you 45 minutes just to get some bloody bread and milk!

I'd be lying if I said that half or more of the problem here isn't my own inability to adapt. And that I sometimes get so homesick that I am tempted to just say fuck it and jump on a plane and come home. but America does have some good points. And I'm not the sort to admit defeat and come home with my tail between my legs anyway.

The process for South Korea is pretty standard though. You find a scheme on the internet (there's one called Jet Scheme but I can't remember any more off the top of my head) and you send them your CV and answer a few questions. Think you have to do some CRB check and some other little bureaucratic bits and pieces. You sign a contract in the UK and then the rest is dependent on what scheme you're on I think. Some will pay for flights, some will offer bonuses, some will offer different amounts of paid holiday and stuff. They will choose your school and they will find you a place to live.  

You can do these schemes for pretty much all of eastern Asia but I know South Korea's are very reliable and I've never really heard stories of people getting there and finding they live in a shed and teach in a school in the middle of nowhere (which can often be the case in China).

In terms of the language and feeling like a colonial douche bag... Seriously, don't worry about it. You're going to the country because you have something to offer them, you're not taking advantage. They pay you fairly and as long as you work hard and live up to your side of the contract then you both win. 

As soon as I arrived in China I put myself to learning their language, I'm still very sketchy but comfortable getting by. I've never had a proper class either, there's so many learning tools on the internet and hearing the language all day every day really helps drum it into your head. There's not much I enjoy more than being told my Chinese is really good by a local! Makes me feel warm inside. And I've never felt overwhelmed and lost because I can't speak.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Yes, there is. Because when you set your sights on a goal at that age, it results in you selecting certain pathways in whichever part of your education is elective. Speaking from experience, this is. 

When you get to sixth form or go to college you begin plotting a certain course by selecting which subjects to focus on. You're effectively pinning a lot of your hopes and a deal of effort on a target that might be entirely out of reach. 

I know I would have appreciated some more information when it came to this. My interests and my skills don't really align well - I'm fascinated by hard sciences, physics and engineering in particular, but am cripplingly bad at maths and all the formulae involved. I'm good at graphic and product design, and English - though my commenting style on reddit is no testament to this - but I don't feel any particular passion for them. But I went with those, playing to my strengths rather than my interests. And the market for graphic designers is highly competitive, especially since the advent of pirated DTP software making every goon with a cracked copy of Photoshop thinking he qualifies, which resulted in me leaving university early to seek work rather than working up a huge debt for something so hotly contested (and entering the job market just as it shat the bed).

On the other hand, if I'd been aware that engineers and physicists are always in demand then I might have undertaken some private tuition to unfuck my mathsbrain and actually have a career right now in my mid-twenties, rather than being a perpetually underemployed angerfest.

SO my point is, if we can get to it past the pontificating, that yes, it is important. This isn't speaking in terms of unrealistic expectations borne of the myth of exceptionalism, with everyone thinking that if they try hard enough they can become a lawyer for the mayor's office and also the world's strongest millionaire. It's more about people looking for work in sectors that are already overcrowded when a little guidance could not only benefit their careers and consequently their quality of life, but also contribute to the betterment of the economy.

&gt;That said, ""Enough Food For Everyone IF"" appears to be a campaign, rather than a charity

I know, I checked before I made the post, a comprehensive list is available one click away from their homepage: http://enoughfoodif.org/who-we-are

&gt;It says they'll publish a full funding report at the end of their campaign

We'll see, no point arguing about hypotheticals.

&gt;I guess in this case the suits could have been hired from or donated by a corporate partner, hired commercially, supplied by individual participants, etc... 

You vastly overestimate campaigns of this size, I doubt any of what you have said is the case but I'm willing to be proven wrong if/when the funding report is released.

&gt;the expense for 500 suits and masks, relative to the likely size of this campaign, the awareness they're raising and the potential for future fundraising/campaigning off the back of this, **is nothing at all.**

I think if you saw the amount of good that could be done on the ground with the likely expensive of this stunt campaign, you'd change your mind on that. That also taps into the much broader question of the unbridled waste and self-congratulatory bullshit that many of the larger charities indulge in.

&gt;And, perhaps most importantly, it's their money to spend.

Interesting way to look at it, by that logic our tax is not our money either. I actually believe that a lot if not most of the people who donate to charities through various methods, are oblivious to the incredible amounts of money that is spent on advertising, stunts, campaigns, legal challenges (BY the charities), dinners, massive salaries etc.

As you say it's up to an individual's responsibility to decide if and who to donate to but the charities spend an inordinate amount of money on hiding the things I talk about.

This is not done because web containers do not typically come bundled with data-access bridges but they do usually come with session-management features. To be honest it may not even be worth it, a single web page can be built from many requests (particularly with AJAX) and every one of these would require an extra DB lookup for the session info. You'd need an in-memory cache of some sort to avoid hammering the DB needlessly. 

What might be even better would be to persist the session when it's dropped from the session manager, that way it can be restored months later.

The move is as difficult or as simple as you like. Looking below a lot of single guys are doing it, as I did to Oz. I sold/got rid of everything and didn't take anything I couldn't check onto my flight. Quite a liberating experience. When I moved to the states I had a 1 year old and a lot more stuff.

New countries and cultures are exciting... IF you are prepared to get involved. I have never joined an ex-pat club, never actively looked for other Brits abroad. I dislike the whinging Pom's down under and the pretentious yank bashing twats over here. I have learned that no one culture/country has got it right and I love and hate elements from all of them.

true,Wand3rer,uk,Cambridge,"I'm answering on my phone, so forgive any typos or bad grammar.

Where I'm from is a difficult question to answer. I've lived in Brazil, Chile, The US, and Germany, among others. 

I'm living in Cambridge, which may have biased me slightly. 

Everything is super expensive, even in cities like Manchester. I often have to decide whether I want a pint or to eat for a couple days. (Slight exaggeration)

I miss the variety of fresh produce available year round. 

People here are either super fit, or they don't give a single shit, smoking tons of cigarettes, eating like shit, and drinking like fish. Most people fall in the latter category. 

Women here will dress in tiny black dresses, cake on makeup, and roam the streets in surprisingly inebriated flocks, stumbling over themselves in subzero weather. Also, is there so little sun in this country that people can't distinguish between areal tan and oompa-loompa cream? For a country as concerned by propriety as England, this really surprised me.

England likes to think of itself as a progressive, sexually liberated country, but is still incredibly awkward about sex (generally speaking). This also translates to people generally (not universally) being bad at it. 

Your posh dickheads are the most infuriating in the world (tied for first with Brazil). 

You follow rules and traditions just because they exist. There may be a better way of doing something, but damned if you'll break with tradition to do it that way.

These are all generalizations, so of course there will be exceptions. There are just some of my broad impressions.

Now the positives: I love classy, intelligent, sophisticated englishwomen - of which there are many.

You're some funny bastards. I hope I pick up some of it before I leave.

English food is actually ok. You have the best Indian food and kebabs on the world.

I understand tea now. It is one of the most amazing things in the world. 

The beer. The glorious, amazing, delicious beer. 

The English do not deserve their reputation for being cold and distant. They are generally incredibly welcoming, friendly, and kind. They may laugh, or be put off by my Latin/American friendliness, openness, and exuberance, but they would never let you know it, and generally seem to like interacting with people like me- so long as we're not too over the top. 

Londoners love to complain about the Underground, but it is the most impressive public transport system I have ever experienced. They should consider themselves lucky. 

Your trains are fantastic, as well.

England is a beautiful country.

Your teeth really aren't that bad. 

England is safe - I don't generally walk the streets with one eye cast over my shoulder.

You're a resilient lot. Damned if the shit weather and two world wars will shake you. 

You pretend to be pessimists, but you're not really. It's all a front, as optimism is uncool. 

You take care of your own, which is more I can say of most places I've lived. You should all be proud.

Here's some of my thoughts about being in IL vs. Blighty:

""I just love your accent"" Chances of getting laid unlocked! Also can give more credibility to what you say

Nods head but doesn't understand you You just said ""It's somewhat of a controversy"" and the didn't understand the last word (pronunciation was different) so the whole sentence is now blown up. However rather than saying ""i'm sorry I didn't understand you"", some locals just nod their head. Please tell me so I can rephrase!

Driving in Chicago - no more aggressive than a trip around the M25

McDonalds isn't just for Chavs and hungover people. Everyone goes there it seems.

People have a negative view on caffeine. Our tea drinking nation insists that children drink a brew as soon as they're out of the womb. Apparently people here think caffeine should be kept away from children

Still can't produce decent chocolate. Even Thorntons is better than their ""boutiques"" - Cadbury's is available, but...

Black pudding, proper sausages and bacon. These are nectar of the gods, yet no-one here understands them. Or Coleman's English Mustard (but you can buy it from Jewel, so at least there's hope)

Chicago understands how important food and drink is - though it's improved no-end in the UK, let me show you a Chicago aged steak; puts our food industry to shame

There are no hills in Illinois - this can make one homesick

Winters can be HARSH. A few years ago we had a spell of -30'C. While Canada gets it worse, months of snow and cold drain the spirit. Luckily that's why drinking is also popular here. And we have snowploughs and stuff that clear the roads within hours! None of that country in chaos at the drop of a flake

While we're on the subject, this is not the 1970's so why do UK folks still insist on buying all the bread and milk available; In Chicago it's business as usual

Summers are awesome - guaranteed sun!

Grilling (BBQ) isn't a once a year thing. It's the staple summer cooking option

Property Taxes - I paid GBP125.00 per month for a 3 bed house in the UK. I now pay $800 for a 4 bed house. FUCK!!!!

Petrol prices - $4 a gallon?!? OUTRAGEOUS! Oh wait... yeah, UK is $11. STFU.

Chicago people are way more friendly and sociable

7 years here and I have yet to see a bar fight, or a welsh bird urinating into a manhole cover. Every weekend where I lived.
Cops will ticket you for anything and are everywhere. You can't speed, you can't argue your case. Does not apply to attractive women with large tits.

100mph on the M40 is the norm. 70mph on I-55, I-88 and others. You can guarantee some state police car is waiting for you if you go over 75. Waze is your friend.

Drivers are less aware of their surroundings - mainly because they have a fucking phone attached to their head.

Metra trains are (comparatively) awesome and cheap. British Rail could learn a lot from them.

There is obvious racism from all sides everywhere, but then some folks don't do themselves any favours by stereotyping themselves.

Guns. Please. You don't need them. It's not the 1700's anymore and the militia are non-existent. Get over it.

American folks are more inclined to do their own home improvement - I kind of like that.

Hard to get decent bread. And bread you do buy, lasts 3 weeks if you keep in the fridge... WTH is in that?!?

Eating out is the norm. Cooking is a dying art.

Skunks fucking stink.

People are more concerned about their physical appearance - hence why they give Brits a hard time about their teeth. It's a big deal to have straight teeth here. And bigger tits.

Healthcare can be very expensive. Hospital bill for giving birth = $45,000.00. After insurance, $3,000.00. Who can justify $70 for a niacin tablet?

American women are more approachable and more open than their UK counterparts. Many American men have no fucking clue how to treat American women, leaving us UK men a target rich environment.

Sterling is an example of a player who has been very dangerous - even against top level sides.  Not saying he hasn't had his bad moments, but that is what you need to look for in youth talent.  I expect Liverpool youth players to perform well against teams like Olham or Grasshoppers, or whoever they played in the early Euro.

Keep being positive with the youth players, but please be critical.  Your doing nobody favors when you just compliment every youth player that makes it though.  I'm in no way saying he can't turn it around, but movement and position can be easily changed.  Player Mentality is a lot harder.  Turnovers and decision making fall under that category =(

I lived in the Kingston-Upon-Thames area. Coming from rural Canada, there seemed to be so much more going on in the UK, all the time. There was so much more to see (maybe just because I was seeing it all at once, for the first time) and discover. There were *so many people!* And I never thought I would see a place as multicultural as Toronto, perhaps moreso because even within such a small country there are so many local dialects, traditions, and stories. There was no snow! There were local strawberries in March! What was this strange paradise?

The downside - it was incredibly expensive. It was difficult seeing all this amazing culture, fashion, cuisine, and feeling left out of the party because I couldn't take part. It was damp, all the time. I'd go to bed with wet hair and wake up with wet hair and wet clothes. It seemed impossible to ""get ahead"", although I think this is a global trend and I've noticed it here in Canada too but to a lesser extent. And the British demeanour is not something I really understood fully until I got home. Brits aren't as friendly as Canadians but that doesn't mean they're not good people, it's more about differing routines for how social you are with strangers. A lot of time I felt that people were rude to me and I'm sure I came off as overly keen to others.

I don't know if I can/will go back. My working holiday visa expires the end of this year and I don't know if it's possible to secure another one. I do feel like I missed out on the whole UK experience though. It's a long story.

true,p4rus,eng-essex,Essex,"Not sure why I'm doing this - I'm not sure we disagree all that much. Steam-of-conciousness replies below:

&gt;I did, they refused to disclose the number.

Then that's totally shit and it's really hard not to infer negative stuff from it. Like you, I hope they do publish a full report at the end of their campaign. They're not a charity though and may not be bound by the same kind of strict rules that charities are, though.

&gt;I think if you saw the amount of good that could be done on the ground with the likely expensive of this stunt campaign, you'd change your mind on that. 

I know how much good can be done with large, or small, amounts of money - I work for a small (cÂ£1.2m/yr income), totally unrelated UK charity. Obviously every pound spent by this campaign on their, er, campaigning, could have been spent on a ""direct charitable expense"", either by the campaign or their donor groups. But my assumption is that the large, legitimate charities and trusts who support them have received some kind of application for funding, have done their research, looked at the campaign and its goals, and have decided that it is worth some of their money and having their name and brand associated with it.

&gt;That also taps into the much broader question of the unbridled waste and self-congratulatory bullshit that many of the larger charities indulge in.

There are sometimes issues, yes. But a lot of what you call ""unbridled waste"" and ""self-congratulatory bullshit"" is probably essential stuff like - and please don't laugh - networking. Mutual backslapping is annoying, fuck knows I hate doing it half the time, but it's a *really* good way to raise your profile, raise your ability to lobby at a local/national level, it makes you new partners and relationships, brings corporate/individual/trust donors on board, and so on. It's maybe not a ""direct charitable expenditure"" like buyng a malaria net or something but it's no less necessary than paying your office-space's rent. Certainly where I work, without ""self-congratulatory bullshit"", we wouldn't be able to achieve a fraction of what we do.

&gt;Interesting way to look at it, by that logic our tax is not our money either. 

Tax is a bit different to that and I don't think it's really a great comparison. We have to pay tax; we don't have to support charities. Anyway, what I was getting at there was that each charity that supports the campaign has had some kind of application, then assessed and approved it. The campaign is using these charity's names to get you to trust them and support them: ""Like Oxfam and Christian Aid? You'll love us!"" And again, different rules for a charity and a ""campaign"", blah blah, charities are strictly controlled on how/where they spend, and so on.

&gt;I actually believe that a lot if not most of the people who donate to charities through various methods, are oblivious to the incredible amounts of money that is spent on advertising, stunts, campaigns, legal challenges (BY the charities), dinners, massive salaries etc.

I've no doubt some people are mislead, but I seriously doubt the majority are. Give people some credit, please. Every charity produces and publishes an annual report, externally audited, stating their income, their outgoings and so on. Suggesting that charities shouldn't spend ""incredible amounts"" on what basically amounts to ""fundraising"" though, simply misunderstands how charities have to work. Advertising - and sometimes ""stunts"" and campaigns - are necessary to raise your profile, awareness of and support for your causes, your events, and so on. Without that lot you'll have no power to influence people, they won't donate or support you and you have no ability to achieve your goals, whatever they may be. ""Dinners"" are that same essential networky bollocks from earlier; without strong support from for-profit orgs, or whoever you're wining and dining, most charities would flounder pretty quickly. We have close relationships with a number of UK-wide corporations who share some of our aims and goals; without their support in terms of finances, profile, gifts-in-kind, etc, we'd be nothing close to what we are.

I know nothing about legal challenges. 

Salaries, though... Personally, I'm on Â£21k/yr, having worked up to that over 3.5 years. A nearly identical role to what I do, only at a trade union, was advertised a couple of years back for Â£35k-37k/yr as a starting salary (not that I'm suggesting I'm worth that!). Even managerial salaries, which, at around Â£50k+/yr for a small charity may seem high, are lower than non-charity equivalent for a simlar position/responsibility. Running a charity is hard, and realistically you need to spend money in order to secure someone with the experience and ability to do it. Again, unpalatable perhaps, but essential.

&gt;As you say it's up to an individual's responsibility to decide if and who to donate to but the charities spend an inordinate amount of money on hiding the things I talk about. I also dislike the impunity they enjoy because questioning these wonderful organisations is considered taboo - there are some excellent large charities and it's a bugbear of mine that the wasteful ones purposely suck away money from them.

Nobody's saying it's a taboo to question things, that's why charities produce and publish in-depth annual reports. I'm not sure charities spend ""inordinate amounts"" of money hiding things either. As I said, they publish externally agreed annual reviews and can't hide stuff.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"&gt; My immediate thought is that this regulation simply will not work. The BBC is one of the mostly tightly regulated news organisations in the world and still managed to spawn the Saville and McAlpine scandals.

Saville has nothing to do with press regulation. McAlpine is a single incident. The tabloids are involved in a McAlpine-level abuse every week at the very least, it's just that everyone expects them to behave in that way, and they carefully pick their targets to be vulnerable, without the resources to get access to the libel courts. Most of their innaccuracies are never heard of again, because they do not print meaningful retractions. The BBC, partly because of its instititutional culture, partly because of Ofcom, and partly because they happened to pick on someone who was rich, immediately and prominently retracted their story, and everyone now know that it was incorrect. The point of a regulator is not to eliminate all incorrect stories for ever and ever, the point is to reduce incorrect stories and alter the culture of tabloid journalism, and give innocent, ordinary people some modicum of the ability to defend themselves that the wealthy have had access to for centuries.

For Private Eye, who generally attack the wealthy and the powerful, libel reform is far more important than Leveson, and the libel reforms are currently working their way through parliament, and should be put into force before the next election.

But that's a lot of money, and who knows if we will be able to afford it. 

Bale -- probably wouldn't even accept a transfer to Man City, but even if he did, I don't really think he fits in the team all that well. People are already casting him as the next C. Ronaldo but that may be a big mistake. He will probably go to Man U or Real Madrid if he leaves, but I don't know who would pay ~70 million for him. No player is worth that much not named Ronaldo or Messi. 

Neymar -- He's going to Barca. And I think he might be another Robinho. 


I just hope that Mancini is allowed to continue building a team and not forced to play footballers with inflated egos and salaries just because they sell jerseys. 

Despite all the derision of last summer's purchases, we got Nastasic and Javi Garcia, both of which could be in our team for many years. We need to get those types of players as well as the big money purchases because that's how you build a team. 

I guess what I'm getting as is I'd be happy with a clear-out of a few big salary players, replacing them with some good players that fit in the team a little more, allow Guidetti a chance in the first team, and splash the cash on Cavani because I think he fits the team and will dominate the Premier League.

So long as we have the players and stability, we are going to win plenty of trophies, if Mancini is given time and money to continue building the team. Focusing on one game is silly, but that's how things are, unfortunately.

I always played the NCAA football games growing up but I got tired of them about the time I left for college.  I was hanging out with some buddies one day and he asked if I wanted to play FIFA.  I was awful, but I loved how it was different from all the other games I had played because no two matches were ever the same (if only it were like that still).  After that I started playing in secret so that I could finally beat my friends.  I chose to play with Liverpool because Fernando was faster than fuck and Stevie had a cannon of a right leg.  Eventually I was able to find games on TV so naturally I was exposed to the Manchester United's and the Chelsea's, but for some reason I really liked to watch Liverpool.  To be honest, I watched Liverpool so I could watch Fernando Torres.  Only then did I start to learn about the history of the club and what it really means to be a part of LFC.  I truly fell in love with the club the season that we sold Fernando to Chelski.  Only then did I realize that I was a supporter of something more than just a single player.  Since then, I have found other similarities between LFC and all the other sports teams I have grown up supporting, which has helped me to love them even more.  Anyways, I've gone on far too much, so I apologize.

They all had allegiances to the bigger EPL teams, such as Man U, Arsenal, Chelsea... so I looked into the EPL's history to see what teams might be worth cheering for that wasn't one of the teams my friends cheered for. I saw Liverpool had a long history of winning, was considered to be one of the 'big four,' and they had a couple players whose names I recognized (Gerrard, Torres). The first game I **remember** watching of theirs was the 4-1 win at Old Trafford. At that point I knew that not only had I found a team I wanted to start investing myself in (more than just watching games, but actually following their progress on a bigger scale), but I also got to tease my ManU supporting friends...

Growing up, I guess I always rebelled against him by never taking an interest in soccer as a kid, I was never any good and really didn't care. I'd always been obsessed with music, however, particularly British music, and one day I happend to catch the beginning of Liverpool vs. Juventus in the quarter-finals of the 2005 Champions League, and saw the entire stadium belting out a Gerry and the Pacemakers tune as if it were their national anthem. From that moment on I fell in love, and after the Champion's League final a month later, that love became religion.

    Some people identify themselves as Northern Irish to proclaim a vague sense of attachment to the British state, and some people use it to disassociate from being considered 100% Irish.

I think more and more people  are referring to themselves as Northern Irish( http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/interactive/2012/dec/12/northern-ireland-census-national-identities-mapped) , so it could be an effective depolarisation of the population.

I suppose a lot of it has to do with what cultural practices, social circles, religious beliefs  you associate yourself with and what your understanding of Irish and British history is.
   I consider myself Northern Irish because I don't deny that we are in Britain but I also consider myself an Irishman because I believe, in my understanding of British Imperialism and the Ulster scots settlements, that it was Ireland before it was considered Britain, and although I realise that the British monarchy does not reflect the British or Northern Irish General Public, I have great problems with what they have done in many countries throughout the world and therefore I would like to be able to voice through my choice of Identity that I would not want to be associated with or feel in any way a subservience to the British state.

Took me a while to get used to living with flat mates - I'd never done that, as I got my own place once I moved out of my parents' house. 
One thing I could never get used to was the quality of building - be it the places I lived or wherever my mates were/are living. And, of course, the expense of living (accommodation in particular) in general was ludicrous. I'm now back in Germany and still enjoy having my place to myself. :-)

Having said that, I really loved my time there (2 years):

-the BBC is amazing

-I was given great opportunities at work, even though my formal qualifications did not match. Once I was in and showed potential no one cared for a piece of paper (contrary to here)

-I found people to be much friendlier than advertised, too

-Have not met an English person yet who did not have a great sense of humour

-got used to carriying around sunnies, brolly and book at all times

-the tube is great. But I gotta say the bus system (once you figure it out) is equally good. In my first few months, I could only afford a buss pass and to this day I enjoy seeing the city from an upper deck. 

-the mix of cultures and nationalities, all pretty much getting along

-still not over the FREE museums and culture in general 

-the sense of anonymity and everyone getting on with their live was relieving (but maybe that's due to where I came from)

I still come back regularly and and still enjoy it, and have seen much more of England outside of London since. It's a beautiful country which is easy to forget in all the doom and gloom.

I never really liked baseball or American football, so I made soccer my thing to follow.

I remember when it would be ""sports day"" in grade school kids would wear Yankees, Jets, Mets, Giants, Devils and Rangers(and other NYC/NJ sports teams) jerseys and there I'd be in one of the classic 90s Liverpool kits with ridiculous designs. Kids made fun, but I held my head up high and didn't care.

true,groovejet,uk,London,"Peruvian here living in the UK for more than 2 years now.

Why I moved here? Well I there were mainly two factors. The first one was that I work in IT and I get paid way more here (even when you consider the higher cost of life). Since I am half-spanish and have dual citizenship I decided to move here and try to get a job. I had some friends living here already that helped me with getting a place to stay. The other one is that I'm gay and it sucks being gay in Lima (and the rest of Peru is even worse). I was under constant fear that someone would out me at my work and get me fired, besides you always face hostility even from the authorities who are supposed to be there to defend you.

I think it was one of the best decicions I've taken in my life. I really enjoy living in London. The weather might be colder, but is not that bad. I just have problems in January when it dawns around 8am since it gets me a little depressed. Rain is not bad, while I miss Lima where it barely rains I've also lived in Brazil where it rains a fuckload more than here and people don't complain as much.

About London I love how you can meet people from everywhere in the world it kinda opens your mind. Also there is always something to do. Public transport might be expensive, but is WAY BETTER than anything you can get on the 3rd world and Londoners complaining about it should use Lima's transport system to realize how good they have it. One thing I will never understand though is this fixation that Londoners seem to have with living in houses with gardens in such a big city, even more when the weather is so shit that you can barely use them because it's too cold outside or it is raining. Funny enough, then you complain that there is no more space for building houses in this country and that your homes are too small. I always lived in flats and moved to one here in London a couple of months ago and I'm happy with them. I prefer living closer to the city centre and spend less time on public transport. I feel London shouldn't bee that sprawled. In addition I think that there are plenty of public parks when the day is sunny.

The only thing I don't like is that I feel I will never be able to afford a home even though my salary is above the median in London, but I guess you cannot have it all.

All it can do is handle any applications for ""recognition"" (a de-recognise regulators if they don't follow the guidelines), and give guidance/report on the stuff they're doing.


There are also some amendments to the ""Crime and Courts Bill"" (the legislation part) which mess around with ""**exemplary damages**"" (punishing people to make an example out of them), ""**aggravated damages**"" (adding extra damages to cover ""mental harm"" suffered) and legal costs in cases relating to people who publish news-related stuff in the course of business (with at least 2 authors, and an editor), over things like defamation, privacy and harassment.

This messing mainly involves making publishers immune from some of these if they are signed up to a ""recognised regulator."" Mainly it is to encourage people who can join a regulator to do so, and those regulators to apply to be ""recognised.""

I've been here for 2 years, and came to be with my other half as we had been doing the long-distance thing since we both moved away from Germany (she got a job back at home in Chile, me in the UK). I've lived and worked across the World so was very happy to try a new country and culture.

I am very happy here, got ok Spanish, and am immersed in local life (I only have 3 non-latino friends). The weather is fantastic, our flat looks out onto the Pacific and I earn 25% more here than in the UK. However, things are more expensive here (and getting worse), and some things drive me loopy. The uni I work at here is terribly inefficient and sometimes I don't get paid for a few months. This is not considered a big issue by the administrators and frankly I've had enough.
I've maintained my position in the UK and we will be heading back in 2014. I'll be sad to leave in some ways (weather, Pacific Ocean, family) but will also be happy to be back in a predictable work environment (less pay, but more regular). 

We have a wee boy and this has made things complicated as we both would like him to grow up knowing both cultures. Trouble is, the city I work in in the UK has very few latinos, so we might be looking to shift to a different city, e.g. London).

In the end, it is possibly not up to me (nor anyone here) what happens to Reddit due to the new laws...  
However, I am concerned about the future proofing of /r/unitedkingdom and possibly Reddit from ""blanket-cover"" news laws. I am just highlighting that, to a person who does not know what a ""Reddit"" is, they may see it as something different than what the community here describes.  

# ` `

Hence my post on whether we should change some things, again consider rewording the items on the sidebar for example, to emphasise more that this area is based more towards being a community.

Though this may not be able to stop Reddit or /r/unitedkingdom from being covered as the [Royal Charter (PDF)](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/142808/18_March_2013_v6_Draft_Royal_Charter.pdf ""Schedule 4, Section 1"") (and the video) describes:

* Relevant publisher to mean ""a website containing news - related material (whether or not related to a newspaper or magazine);""

* ânews-related materialâ means:  
i. news or information about current affairs;  
ii. opinion about matters relating to the news or current affairs; or  
iii. gossip about celebrities, other public figures or other persons in the news.

# ` `

being subject to the charter [with the exemption of](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2012-2013/0137/amend/pbc1371803m.1043-1049.html ""NC29 - Subsection 3""):

* (Subsection 3)  
A person who is the operator of a website is not to be taken as having editorial or equivalent responsibility for the decision to publish any material on the site, or for content of the material, if the person did not post the material on the site.

* The fact that the operator of the website may moderate statements posted on it by others does not matter for the purposes of subsection (3).

* A person is not a ârelevant publisherâ if the person is specified by name in Schedule [Exclusions from definition of ârelevant publisherâ].

* A person is not a ârelevant publisherâ in so far as the personâs publication of news-related material is in a capacity or case of a description specified in Schedule [Exclusions from definition of ârelevant publisherâ].â. 

# ` `

In terms of this and personal outlook on the laws, what I can gather is that Reddit (the company) is not liable for claims (unless they ordered the publication). This could also include the moderators of /r/unitedkingdom/ (depending again if it were ordered by them to be released). But a person writing content which could be caught by the laws, will be.  
Is this correct?

true,benbread,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall via Swansea,"This is great advice - You should dip your feet with something like python or php to see if it's the sort of thing you enjoy - If you don't enjoy it you might find the whole thing to be quite an upwards battle.

If this is something you enjoy then great, there are so many online resources, open source projects and support that you don't need to spend any money at all to get to a position where you're incredibly employable.

If I was in the same situation I'd get to grips and then start building a portfolio as quickly as possible - If it's your cup of tea you can very quickly get to grips with something like android (java based) and begin pulling apart open source apps, modifying them an seeing the results - When I was younger this is the exact sort of thing I did to teach myself programming and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

I wouldn't personally go down the C++ route; it's a big learning curve to do anything meaningful and I worry something like the codebase of firefox would be too advanced for many many people. My (somewhat biased) advice is to learn C# and WPF - You can download Visual Studio Express for free and start developing Windows/Web/WP7 applications very easily.

tl;dr - Learn some high-level language like Python, see if you enjoy it and then go from there - Focus on skills that are in demand with employers (C#, ASP.net, PHP, Mobile) and build up a portfolio.",0,1363723032,null,0,false,0,c8yn4wd,t3_1alls9,t1_c8yn4wd,t1_c8yml2u,null,1431637558,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5
