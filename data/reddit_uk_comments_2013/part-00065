true,notmentat,UnionFlag,London - Kawasaki ER-6n,"No, the DAS doesn't include CBT. I assume you've got a CBT if you own a 125, so you'll be fine. The course will just concentrate on teaching you to pass the Big bike tests.

The two tests are separate, so if you pass Mod1 you've passed. If you then fail Mod 2, you have to retake Mod 2 again, but not Mod 1. There may be a time limit on how long the mod 1 lasts, but it's probably along the lines of the CBT certificate.

Some schools will book them close together, some don't. The school I used had a very high pass rate and booked both mod1 and 2 on the same day generally.
If you cock up the mod 1, you'd forfeit the fees for mod 2.

DAS is just an accelerated learning scheme for accessing big bikes. Technically you don't need to do the course - you could turn up on a big bike for the tests (assuming you have a qualified instructor with you and insurance etc) and take the tests.

true,razdarnell,tardis,TARDIS,"Ok, maybe I was a little harsh implying that there was no plot in any Moffat episode up until now.  But it was nice to see a DIFFERENT plot.  How about that?  

One of the things that Moffat does supremely is create an environment, a setting.  His settings are consistently whimsical, fantastic, engaging, and imaginative.  But he usually falls back on the same couple of plots which are usually resolved (in my opinion) too quickly and almost as an afterthought.  This was fine and not as noticeable during the RTD era, when Moffat's stories were once-per-season.  It also gave him more time to think and create.  

When he took over as showrunner, he still created beautiful settings, but there was always a great deal of handwaving to resolve the plot at the end of each story.  What I liked about Bells of Saint John was how well put together and different it was from Moffat's usual M.O. (meaning there was plot resolution without someone loving, feeling, or believing everything back to normal.  The Doctor was clever.  Really clever.  And he used his brain to save the day.  It was great.)

RTD was almost the opposite.  His settings weren't as pretty, but the plots and character development were (almost) always really good (even--dare I say--1.4 and 1.5 were good episodes if you ignore the horrific special effects and farting, if you'll pardon the word ;D).

So from here, it's a matter of taste.  Are you excited enough by Moffat's settings that you can forgive the lackluster plots? Or would you trade the pretty environments for deeper story/character development?

tl;dr:  Moffat and RTD are different.  I prefer RTD, but the Bells of Saint John gave me hope.",0,1365114393,null,0,false,0,c98n5d5,t3_1bnc6i,t1_c98n5d5,t1_c98kahd,null,1431671004,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

I don't know where you got that idea from. The viewers have never been a part of the world of Doctor Who (as evidenced by the lack of narration and the fact that no one ever looks at the camera). We the viewers could presumably see an angel move if that angel were alone, because we don't exist in that world. 

&gt;In the episode ""Flesh and Stone"", we see an angel's head move while we are looking directly at it. That took away the reality that he gave us in the original episode. It is now impossible to argue that the angels are real.

No, this is not a problem, because we the viewers were not there in that scene.

That said, don't set your sights *too* high. Make an honest assessment of your skills and experience, and apply for jobs at your level.

I'm not sure about moving to a bigger city for work though. Sure, there are more jobs, but there are also more unemployed people. I find there are around 50 other applicants for jobs I apply for in the villages surrounding Derby, compared to 200 in the city itself.

Being an American, I really didn't have much exposure to soccer (football?) growing up.  In 8th grade, as the World Cup was coming up, I downloaded the FIFA 2010 World Cup app for my iPod touch. I started a tournament with England (because even I knew the US was shit) and three matches into the group stage, I had 11 goals with this guy ""Steven Gerrard"" (I pronounced it like jur-rard, I had no idea). Anyway, I decided to look him up when I got home, and I decided to informally become a liverpool fan.  Over the summer, I watched a few games and kept seeing this ""gerrard"" character pop up.  Next year, in high school, I became really close friends with another LFC fan, one much more committed than me. He had me download FM2012 for my iPhone, and I was hooked. I got FIFA for xbox after that, started watching soccer whenever it was on. I wouldn't consider myself a fan until my father surprised me with tickets to the AS-Roma summer game in 2012.  We went, I got myself a Henderson shirt (for a while it seemed a bad decision, if he was to be sold in January, now I'm very happy I've got it).

true,vlexo1,uk,United Kingdom,"Well, the main cost for the ""replacement"" are the submarines, that alone will cost £11-14 billion pounds. 

I've read the white paper on this and would encourage many who are discussing this subject to read it as well. This is just an extract from the ""costs"" section:

&gt;5-11. The procurement costs involved in 
sustaining our independent deterrent 
capability will need to be refined as work on 
the concept and assessment phases is taken 
forward with industry. More accurate cost 
estimates will be available by the time we 
come to place a contract for the detailed 
design of the submarines in the period 
2012 to 2014. Our initial estimate is that the 
procurement costs will be in the range of 
**£15-20 billion** (at 2006/07 prices) for a four-boat 
solution: some **£11-14 billion** for the submarines; 
**£2-3 billion** for the possible future refurbishment 
or replacement of the warhead; and **£2-3 
billion** for infrastructure over the life of the 
submarines. There would be savings from a 
three-boat solution but these would not be 
in proportion to the reduction in the number 
of submarines. These costs will fall principally 
in the period 2012 to 2027. The comparable 
cost for the Trident system was some £14.5 
billion at today’s prices. These costs are also 
comparable to the procurement costs of 
major weapons systems such as Typhoon 
aircraft. Depending on future decisions, there 
could also be the cost of starting to replace 
the **D5 missile from the 2030s**. At this range, any 
estimate of cost would be highly speculative: 
the equivalent cost for the Trident D5 missile 
was some £1.5 billion at today’s prices.

Also, if we wanted to use French systems that would entail either using the same designed submarines or creating similar designs to support their missile technology. France spent €4 billion euros per submarine, so if we switched to that option, the costs would similar to what we are currently paying for the upgrade/replacement option with Trident. - It's not a cheaper system and we would also be buying totally new missiles (While we will be refurbishing current missiles we have in-stock), so in-fact if we went with the French option the costs would sky-rocket.

true,pbhj,uk,.,"&gt;*In Western societies, it is illegal to marry someone who is closely related to you. Why would it be any different with same-sex couples?* //

The reason that it's illegal to marry someone who is closely related is that marriage is primarily about procreation and off-spring of near relatives tend to have genetic defects. Yes, some marriages are unable to beget children but they're edge cases in the long and broad history of marriage.

With civil partnerships between same-sex people there is no possibility of the partnership producing children naturally and so there is no need to legislate away the possibility. So all that is left to rely on is the incest taboo. So the legislation that would disallow this would be based on ""because it's icky"".

You can't extend the right of marriage to same-sex couples because a same-sex couple can't consummate their union, for a start. The premise is supposed to be equality, well that means you don't exclude people from being able to have a government label based on who they are. 

If you want to redefine marriage to include homosexual couplings based on ""equality"" then there is no rational reason you can stop there you have to allow same family couples and multiple partner ""marriages"" too. Indeed if marriage is to be detached from creation of families, as it appears is the intention, then there's no reason to restrict marriage between heterosexual relative pairs instead it can simply be said that they are allowed to marry but not allowed to engage in sexual activity likely to produce a child. One may not even need that restriction in the future - again with equality as our guide - incestuous marriages could be allowed with procreation as long as the couple/multiple agreed that any child would be screened and terminated if certain genetic abnormalities were present.",0,1365126548,null,0,false,0,c98rebb,t3_1bodp5,t1_c98rebb,t1_c98m3wz,null,1431669002,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

What's wrong with letting the people who want freedom earn it? Why must we always meddle in other countries affairs? 

If we do help out the Syrians and then they turn into some theocratic hell hole like Iran or Afghanistan then people like you will be bitching that we ever intervened. 

I say stop meddling. Let what happens, happen. 

There's no clear right side to back in Syria anyway. It's basically the current dictator or religious nutcases. 

When there's chemical weapons and a pretty extensive military in the mix I'd rather have the dictator in charge to be honest.

true,weblypistol,cnty-uk,Llanfairpwllgwyngyll.... etc.,"&gt;There are several theories about the origin of this informal British term for a toilet. The first, and most popular, is that it derived from the cry of 'gardyloo' (from the French regardez l'eau 'watch out for the water'), which was shouted by medieval servants as they emptied chamber pots out of upstairs windows into the street. This is historically problematic, since by the time the term 'loo' is recorded, the expression 'gardyloo' was long obsolete.

&gt;A second theory is that the word derives from a polite use of the French term le lieu ('the place') as a euphemism. Unfortunately, documentary evidence to support this idea is lacking.

&gt;A third theory refers to the trade name 'Waterloo', which appeared prominently displayed on the iron cisterns in many British outhouses during the early 20th century. This is more credible in terms of dates, but corroborating evidence is still frustratingly hard to find. Various other colourful theories also circulate, involving references to doors numbered '00' or people called 'Looe'.

http://oxforddictionaries.com/words/what-is-the-origin-of-the-word-loo


&gt;The origin of the (chiefly British) term loo is unknown. According to the OED, the etymology is obscure, but it might derive from the word Waterloo. The first recorded entry is in fact from James Joyce's Ulysses (1922): ""O yes, mon loup. How much cost? Waterloo. Watercloset"".

&gt;Other theories are:

&gt;    That it derives from the term ""gardyloo"" (a corruption of the French phrase gardez l'eau! (or maybe garde l'eau!) loosely translated as ""watch out for the water!"") which was used in medieval times when chamber pots were emptied from a window onto the street. However the first recorded usage of ""loo"" comes long after this term became obsolete.

&gt;    That the word comes from nautical terminology, loo being an old-fashioned word for lee. The standard nautical pronunciation (in British English) of leeward is looward. Early ships were not fitted with toilets but the crew would urinate over the side of the vessel. However it was important to use the leeward side. Using the windward side would result in the urine blown back on board: hence the phrases 'pissing into the wind' and 'spitting into the wind'. Even now most yachtsmen refer to the loo rather than the heads.

&gt;    That the word derives from the 17th century preacher Louis Bourdaloue. Bourdaloue's sermons at the Saint Paul-Saint Louis Church in Paris lasted at least three hours and myth has it that wealthier ladies took along ""travelling"" chamber pots that could be hidden under their dresses whenever the need arose to avoid the need to leave. Due to the popularity of the myth the bowls became known as Bourdaloues after the preacher and the name became corrupted to portaloos and sometimes just plain loos due to the habit of shortening words in slang.[citation needed]

 &gt;   That the word comes from the French word lieu (place), as in lieu d'aisance (literally: ""place of ease"", a common euphemism for lavatory) or lieu à l'anglaise (literally: ""English place""). From around 1770 the term lieu à l'anglaise began to appear in France, referring to this English invention which was sometimes installed for the benefit of English visitors.

On the other hand, I have no idea how it feels to be the victim of racist abuse or to fear a kicking because I'm gay or trans.

As a white man, I was subject to random kickings a couple of times when I was younger - at least I knew that I was picked on *only* because I was drunk in the wrong place at the wrong time.

I don't think those events have caused me psychological harm or fear, or generally to have made me feel like I couldn't leave the house, that there was something ""different"", wrong or inherently special about me. When I've had a kicking or been picked on by other citizens, it hasn't generally made me feel like there's a widespread or institutional bias against people like me. A wrongful arrest, on the other hand… 

So what's worse? A kicking, or a racist kicking? Well, the latter has an additional element, doesn't it? It wouldn't be alright to be racist without the kicking, would it?

IMO, it was a slight tactical error by AVB, who presumably thought the extra forward would boost us as a counter-attacking team, but taking off one of our freshest midfielders only widened the gap between our forwards and the rest of the team.

Generally speaking, I compare Dempsey with Bent because I don't think either has the shrewdness of movement that it takes to play consistently against defences that mark tight and sit deep.  Both have scored vital goals for us and had a few good performances (less so Bent , ha!), but don't seem to be able to impact play consistently enough.

Of course, Dempsey can also play wide or behind the striker and so is more useful as a squad option.  ...but I still haven't seen enough to suggest he's a better option through 90mins then other players in the squad.

So, if we're keeping a detterent what are the other options?

Trident is a US designed system (although notably wholly independent - ie. we at no stage need US authorisation to use). Therefore its built for us and its cheaper. We provide a submarine platform and they provide the missile system.

There are calls for ""cheaper"" land or air based systems. Firstly, we'd have to start from scratch on our own which is going to cost a lot of money (we all know how much initial estimates go up by with government projects).

Also, look at the NIMBYs who oppose wind turbines...

Do people honestly believe we would be able to situate a load of nuclear missiles in leafy little England??

Basically, I think the submarine and CASD (continual at sea detterence) option is not only better for capability. I think its the only practical one. It's probably also not that expensive. When you look at the cost and look at the life expectancy of the system, its not as shocking.

Also, it keeps me in a job.

Anyway, Will &amp; Kate are popping up to see us this afternoon so I had better go and smarten myself up...

Yes because the people we are now scared of are all perfectly rational people? Sorry I don't buy it, it worked with the Soviets because it was basically 2 equal sides.

It's insane.

I would catch the train more often if it wasn't for this utter lunacy of having to split fares, and having to shop around to buy a simple train ticket.

I generally don't even consider the train, so I drive instead. It might take longer to drive (station to station) but it's quicker overall because I don't have to spend an hour shopping around for a simple train ticket and travelling to and from the station, and waiting for the train. Usually the cost of the fuel is less than the ticket anyway.

*Challenge accepted!*

I have a friend in Croydon in South London, the journey is 150miles from my house door-to-door (M1 then M25). 

It costs me £90 to fill my tank with diesel.  My car gives me about 650 miles out of that (6yr old 2L Passat is about 50MPG extra-urban). That's £0.138/mile so it's £20.70 worth of fuel (one way).

Try buying a train ticket for that much over that distance. Yes, it can be done but you had to know you wanted to visit your friend 3 months ago ... what if they invited you over for a party only a couple weeks ago? You gonna spend £100 to get there?

Don't forget to change at Euston for the underground to Victoria then catch another train to Croydon, so that's a ride on the underground + train ticket to Croydon!

Under the provisions of the laws governing the creation of the ICO, companies are required to retain personal data only for as long as it is necessary for the functioning of the service.

Worth noting that the UK legislation applies to all companies, not just online ones.

If you cease to be a customer/user of a service, after a reasonable period of time, your information must be automatically deleted.

There is in fact no need for you to ask them to do that - it is an existing legal requirement.

The only information they can keep is basic transactional information which cannot be deleted without screwing up accounting systems and the like.

What the EU scheme would do is add an extra layer of bureaucracy by enabling people to contact companies and demand data to be deleted earlier than it already is. That can cause problems with IT systems which would need to be modified to cope with differential dates for information deletion and to be able to cope with incomplete data when managing backups and reporting.

I struggle a bit to understand why the EU is pushing ahead with this when the UK model actually seems the better one. A sensible balance between the rights of the individual, and the the functional needs of the company.

It's not just about the people we are scared of *now*, it's the ones that may or may not appear in the future.  Until the whole world catches a dose of sanity and dis-arms together there is always going to be a new or rising state on the block who want's to show the rest of the world just how serious they are by making nukes.

I grew up within a few miles of half a dozen RAF and USAF bases full of equipment and people waiting for the the soviets to invade europe, having warplanes in the sky around you constantly whilst the news is full of US-USSR tensions and police actions tends to bring things home to you.   

&gt;Ultimately I feel a nation state is very unlikely to use nuclear weapons on another it's the few mad bastards with 1 that is the real problem and that can't be solved by any amount of submarines.

I don't think trident is necessary. I think nukes held jointly with any other members of NATO would be more than sufficient.

Beyond that, I'm not sure that a nuclear deterrent is actually useful for the UK.  The fact that Russia, China, and the US each hold enough nukes to destroy the world several times over does increase the stability of world politics, but I'm not convinced that the UK holding nukes actually makes a difference here.

The only defensive use of nukes is in Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD), the idea that if you kill us, we will kill you. If you look at the threats that the world actually worries about they are suicidal terrorists, religious extremists (Iran, at least as shown in the press), and juvenile dictators(North Korea). None of these seem to be the kinds of people that care about their own country being blown up in retaliation.

The commitment of Alderweireld runs until the summer of 2014 and contract extension is not obvious, so Ajax would benefit him in the next transfer window to sell. The defender has a preference for Liverpool, but is understandable options open.

The problem with the cookie law is that they're fundamental to the Internet, there's no sane or technically simple way for sites to support 'no cookies' without huge changes, and the legislation kind of acknowledged this and gave the option of a shitty nag screen instead of any real change. 

In comparison, the right to be forgotten is basically do not track, which is already gaining momentum. If it were reeled in a bit to essentially mandate do not track (at the moment it's asking for consent to track, which would just be another line on the cookie popup), I don't see any problem at all. The UK 'objection'  (by Edward Vaizy rather than Grayling) is that you could never be sure a copy of the data hadn't been made and the original deleted so it's unenforceable.

This is absolutely moronic; the same logic could be applied to almost any issue of Internet law - it's always hard to know whether data has been replicated, modified or deleted. And yet they have absolutely no problem pushing for draconian but equally difficult to enforce laws when they benefit corporations. Most obviously, pushing for more draconian copyright policy, and requirements that ISPs hold onto key data for after the fact warrants (at huge expense, might I add).

You have fallen for the media sensationalism technique hook, line, and sinker. 

What are the chances of any given month being the something(est) in 20 years? I'm no statistician, but let's break it down - someone else can work out the exact odds maybe. 

There are 20 Januarys in the last 20 years. Without any trends, assuming just random weather, there is a 1 in 20 chance that it'll be the hottest month - not that high.

Glad you asked. I, working in IT, and Security specifically consider myself to be somewhat knowledgeable on such a proposal. So let me give you a scenario.

Bob, 14, on a drunken night out takes some photos of himself which he publishes online. The WayBackMachine, some of this friends, Google cache, etc all take copies. Furthermore due to Bob's inherent popularity several people take pictures with a handheld camera of the computer screen containing the photo's online. The story even reaches print media. Bob, now wants a paper round. However the owner of the corner shop, researching Bob online decides that this is not the type of employee he wants. Bob, invokes this right to be forgotten. He manages to remove the picture from social networking sites where he is the user concerned. But what of other people who have copied the photo. What of his Wikipedia page which even states the conviction he received? What of the newspapers littering bus seats? What of all the cache systems where he has no idea the photo is stored?

Worse still. Bob is not the only one in the photo. Andrew is in it too. He doesn't want to be forgotten and actively opposes take down.

My views are shared with the European Network and Information Security Agency;
https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/the-right-to-be-forgotten/

&gt; the right to be forgotten is basically do not track

Not quite. The law is much more comprehensive than that.

&gt; This is absolutely moronic; the same logic could be applied to almost any issue of Internet law - it's always hard to know whether data has been replicated, modified or deleted. And yet they have absolutely no problem pushing for draconian but equally difficult to enforce laws when they benefit corporations.

I see your point, but two wrongs don't make a right. I probably agree with you, however, especially given the ISP storage consideration - something I also disagree with on the basis of it being nearly impossible.

You are quite correct in the context of a recent proposal to track people online - specifically the origin and destination of communications with 'plugins' for various services. It is peculiar that our Government can propose with one hand and object with another.

However, it is worth noting that this law covers rights of the individual over their own data. Rather than the right to be monitored. Although they sound similar they are in fact quite different.

true,Frap_Gadz,eng-eastsusex,We Wunt Be Druv,"It's a difficult decision, to have a nuclear arsenal or not, which is why I suppose it comes up so often.

The truth is that we'll probably (I hope) never experience a full nuclear war. I'm sure that most leaders realise that such a thing has the potential to be so devastating for the whole planet, or at least a large part of it, that the very act of the offensive would render any possible ""victory"" worthless.

So on the one hand we have these nuclear weapons we will almost certainly never use, however on the other hand we know that this is the very objective of any nuclear weapons program, hence why we so often describe them as a deterrent. I personally feel that it's a horrendously expensive program, who's main benefactors (in the case of the UK) are largely US defense companies. However if we are to believe that it is truly an effective deterrent for nuclear war then that must be an price we must bear given the alternative. Although are the nuclear weapons potential use the deterrent, if we accept that we will never use them? Or is it just their presence in this world enough to justify our armament?

Myself I think if the UK ever actually experienced a preemptive nuclear strike I feel strongly that I wouldn't want my government to respond with a nuclear counter strike. I think that as I watched my family and friends die in nuclear inferno or of radiation sickness, while our cities crumbled around us, I would not be able to bring myself to wish the same on those who are left. However, as I've said, this isn't why we need these weapons. Moreover, this opinion is lead by my belief that the world will only be a truly safe place until humanity has come to the obvious conclusion that we're one species and that conflict on a planetary scale among ourselves is counterproductive, an ultimately futile exercise in pointlessness. 

With a heavy heart I have to concede that these weapons may be an ugly necessity in the fractured world we currently occupy. I don't believe the government's rhetoric that our countries ""enemies"" weapons are a threat to us and the nuclear weapons we hold are required to counter that. Nuclear weapons are a loaded gun, leveled at humanities head. We need them because we conceived them and now they will never leave us. While humans still fight over their differing ideals or over paltry scraps of land on our diminutive planet, our ultimate weapons of destruction and chaos will always be a lingering threat. While we still divide our species, there will always be those who seek to hold sway over sections of humanity, those people will always strive for ultimate power and thus ultimate corruption. We must live in the shadow of the monsters we have raised against each other, we must all accept that and understand why.",0,1365155307,null,0,false,0,c98yd1a,t3_1bpqmf,t1_c98yd1a,t3_1bpqmf,null,1431665648,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Obviously no-one has tried to invade Germany for 70 years now so they've had nothing seriously threaten their survival recently. Of course SK was invaded 60 years ago and would not exist today without the help the US provided.

I would argue they're untrustworthy. However there's also the issue that if we want to get the US military to protect us we'd be as well to just become another part of America.

&gt;I thought you were a fan of small gov't and low spending?

I'm also a fan of being an independent country. A country which can't protect itself isn't that.

&gt;If so many countries rely on the US for long term deterrence, why can't we?

We could, I just don't trust them to act unselfishly in our interests, the US does not have a history of behaving in that manner and I think many countries assume that they will when they will probably not.

&gt;The only argument I see against that it is the somewhat dated hankering for a strong military. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

I would say that you are. A nuclear deterrent shouldn't even really be considered in context of military power. It's a different sort of animal, not useful in a conventional war, not comparable or relevant to conventional forces.

Our deterrent allows us to know that the only people who'll ever put our interests above those of another (that is, us) have the capability to prevent invasion of the country, or to make invasion so thoroughly unworthwhile that no country would be stupid enough to bother. To rely on conventional forces may work, although would require conventional forces several times the size of what we currently have to get similar odds. To rely on others would require that we pay them significant sums of money, but then we'd be faced with the reality that there's a good chance they wouldn't actually engage in nuclear war for a non-existential threat, namely, the UK's destruction.

That's hyperbole isn't it. That's the sort of comment that people who accuse UKIP of beings Nazi's make.

&gt;I'm also a fan of being an independent country. A country which can't protect itself isn't that.

There are only about a dozen nuclear powers in the world. Are you suggesting that none of the rest are independent?

&gt;I thought you were a fan of small gov't and low spending?

&gt;&gt;I'm also a fan of being an independent country. A country which can't protect itself isn't that.

So you're not that big into small gov't and low spending then?

&gt;We could, I just don't trust them to act unselfishly in our interests, the US does not have a history of behaving in that manner and I think many countries assume that they will when they will probably not.

Acting in our interests would work pretty well for them. They could selfishly defend us. A world of fully functioning stable markets is extremely beneficial for the U.S. If developed nations are reduced to nuclear waste land, that's bad for business. I do not buy your argument. Not to mention that your argument is about deterrent, not actual deployment. If the whole deterrent plan works, we'll never need them to act.

I don't really understand the rest of your comment. Doesn't really make much sense to me. You say nuclear deterrent, but then talk about actual deployment of weapons. If the sole purpose of this is to have a deterrent, why is engaging in war relevant? If nukes are the perfect deterrent, why do we need to be concerned with actually launching them? You say they shouldn't be considered in the context of military power. That's blatantly untrue isn't it. You say nukes are not relevant to conventional forces, but then go on to quantify them against conventional forces. To talk about invasion of this country, also seems peculiar. Any ground forces would have to move through Europe or via air, which would be nigh on impossible for anyone to do, other than Europeans. None of which have conventional forces that dwarf our own. Not mention if any of them did start amassing a force like that, it would become obvious very quickly.

You've not cleared anything up for me. If you could convince me that it would be cheaper to buy our own then I'd be pretty easily swayed to your side of this argument. But as a right-winger and a fervent capitalist, I abhor unnecessary gov't spending and gov't propping up businesses that rely on on gov't spending so much, and you don't really put forward much convincing argument as to why we need to have our own personal system.

From an ideological view point, I can see your argument. Some people want a strong military. But as a pragmatist and a capitalist I just can't see much of an argument to support having our own system.

The problem with that idea is that preparing for things costs money. You need to evaluate possible risk with an understanding of how good your evaluations can be and then plan accordingly.

&gt;What I'm saying is that why are we choosing nukes in particular as the just-in-case option?

Well I could answer that by saying ""we don't"" - we have a limited capability to defend ourselves against conventional invasion with our military. We're part of several military alliances. We maintain good relations with most of the world.

Nukes are just an option which is extraordinarily potent given its relatively low price tag.

&gt;For our nukes to be important, we would need NATO and the UN to be dissolved

You can't know that.

&gt;and both France and the US to refuse to support us.

It's perfectly possible that either or both of those things could happen.

&gt;If this doesn't happen, we're still protected and a ""poisoned apple""

You assume that the US or France would use nuclear weapons for the protection of a foreign state. That is...optimistic. I would not support the UK using our nuclear weaponry in defence of a foreign nation.

&gt;If it does happen, the whole of western politics must have come to an abrupt end, and we're probably fucked even if we do have nukes.

Not in the slightest. You're suggesting what are some relatively minor shifts of power in the grand scheme of history.

It's all too common in people who discuss the abolition of nuclear weapons that they look at the last 30 years of western history and then cite this as example of all of the future. Change can be very rapid, and predictions of the future are liable to be faulty.

We have a relatively cheap method to ensure that we're uninvadable, and un-nukable. In terms of national defence? I'll take that.

People will have children. Even if you start taxing the poor for every child they have, they will still have children. Just like you cannot legislate love or favourite books, you cannot legislate away the desire for two young people to have a family.

The first part of this season pretty much felt like individual episodes with no link. Seriously. Watch all of them besides the last one. The only connection that they have is the recurring theme of Amy and Rory leaving. There is no story arc, no big dilemna, just a bunch of pointless (and in my opinion, boring) adventures. Then the last episode. I'm sorry, but getting rid of your main companion in a single episode just doesn't work. It just feels wrong. It *needs* to be a two parter minimum. Plus I feel TATM could have been more fleshed out in two parts. 

Sure, we have single episodes right now, but thankfully we have an arc in the form of the GI. After the 50th Anniversary though, I expect them to go back to two parters. Longer stories, better plot, better characters/development.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;That's hyperbole isn't it. That's the sort of comment that people who accuse UKIP of beings Nazi's make.

Not intended as such. The ability to defend itself is one of the primary roles of the state. If our state is outsourcing that then it's not really in charge anymore, the yanks are.

&gt;There are only about a dozen nuclear powers in the world. Are you suggesting that none of the rest are independent?

No, I'm just suggesting they're less capable of defending themselves against existential threats than we are.

&gt;So you're not that big into small gov't and low spending then?

I'm not sure I could be described as someone who likes ""small"" government. I support welfare, I support the NHS, and I support free education. That said, I see no reason to have a sprawling government. At the same time, defence is a core responsibility of the state, I'm quite happy for money to be spent efficiently on that.

&gt;Acting in our interests would work pretty well for them. They could selfishly defend us. A world of fully functioning stable markets is extremely beneficial for the U.S. If developed nations are reduced to nuclear waste land, that's bad for business.

WW1 was bad for business. So was WW2. The Napoleonic war nearly bankrupted the UK. War is always bad (overall) for business, that is not a convincing argument against the fact that it will occur.

&gt;If the whole deterrent plan works, we'll never need them to act.

Yes, but we need others to know that action is certain to occur. The only nation which will guaranteeably use nukes to protect a nation is that nation itself.

&gt;I don't really understand the rest of your comment. Doesn't really make much sense to me. You say nuclear deterrent, but then talk about actual deployment of weapons.

I'm not sure you've followed what I was saying, but to clarify, of course nukes can (and may) be used if we're invaded or attacked in any sort of existentally threatening manner.

&gt;If the sole purpose of this is to have a deterrent, why is engaging in war relevant?

Ah right, because nukes are a good guarantee against invasion, but if we don't have nukes then to gain a similar resilliance to invasion would require a large expansion of our miltary.

&gt;If nukes are the perfect deterrent, why do we need to be concerned with actually launching them?

Don't put words in my mouth. I never said they were perfect. They're good, perhaps even great, but they're not perfect.

&gt;You say they shouldn't be considered in the context of military power. That's blatantly untrue isn't it.

I don't think so. They're...different. Their purpose is to be scary, not application as such. They're a different sort of animal to a tank or a fighter jet. I don't really care much whether you agree with me on that point though.

&gt;You say nukes are not relevant to conventional forces, but then go on to quantify them against conventional forces.

Hmm, I suppose the point is is that nuclear forces do not compose an active part of any military per se.  It'd be like if you were playing a game of rock paper scissors with your mates and there's a guy sitting in the corner with a flamethrower. He doesn't play the game with you, he just makes sure you can't get beaten up if your mates decide you're a dick.

&gt;To talk about invasion of this country, also seems peculiar. Any ground forces would have to move through Europe or via air, which would be nigh on impossible for anyone to do, other than Europeans.

They could come by sea, actually. But yes, the most likely route of access would be the European mainland. So what? The concept of large scale or global war is not a nice one, and one I hope that never happens again, but I'm not going to pretend I have a crystal ball and can see 20 or 40 years into the future. You talk as if you can.

&gt;If you could convince me that it would be cheaper to buy our own then I'd be pretty easily swayed to your side of this argument. But as a right-winger and a fervent capitalist, I abhor unnecessary gov't spending and gov't propping up businesses that rely on on gov't spending so much

So vote for parties which want to get rid of our insurance and hope that none of the bad things which nukes are good for stopping come to pass. Black swan events are rare so you'll probably get lucky. If you don't, well hell, at least you got to pay a few quid less in tax every year eh?

&gt;and you don't really put forward much convincing argument as to why we need to have our own personal system.

Because we can't trust anyone else, to be simple about it.

&gt;From an ideological view point, I can see your argument. Some people want a strong military. But as a pragmatist and a capitalist I just can't see much of an argument to support having our own system

This is not about military. Nuke submarines don't impact any of the roles our military carry out.

For instance. WW2. If Roosevelt hadn't been in the Whitehouse during WW2 there's a significant chance the UK would have been conquered. Much of the US leadership gave up on the UK, and it was really primarily Roosevelt who, for essentially individual reasons, decided to help us with significant quantities of material and goods. They fed and armed Britain because of him, but they *almost* didn't.

It's just important to be aware that long alliances still end in the course of a day. Politics can happen fast. In WW2 we were fighting with the Russians against the Germans. 6 years later we were fighting with the Italians (Axis) against the Chinese (again, nominally our allies in WW2) and the Russians.

When a British person moves to Spain, it is for one of two reasons. The first reason is a retirement home. Now, if someone is buying a retirement home, they aren't taking up any jobs in the country, and have the income to support themselves, so, if anything, they are making the economy better in that country. 

The other reason is often to work in the tourism industry. For whatever reason, people like going to Benidorm, having English staff all around them, and sitting around drinking pints all day. This means these staff roles are more suited towards British people. 

However, when a Polish person moves to the UK, it isn't for a retirement home, and isn't for a job in the tourism industry. It is often for a minimum wage job doing something an English person could do, and that's where the 'taking our jerbs' attitude comes from. England-Spain immigration is totally different from Poland-England immigration.

However, where this arguament falls down is the fact that these jobs are often the sort of jobs people don't want to do. If there was a willing and able workforce to take these jobs, there would be no jobs for these Polish people to come across and get.

So having made that clear...

People who get retirement homes in Spain often contribute relatively little to the local economy after the purchase of the property. They may spend their pensions in the local supermarket, but not much else, and purchasing properties also puts up local housing prices and makes them less affordable to local young people. But most importantly, they use a lot of expensive heath services - they have not contributed any taxes towards them and yet move to Spain when they need the most use of health services.

I can't address your ""tourism"" issue because you don't seem to have made a point. To use a UKIP-style argument, Brits coming to Spain to work are taking jobs away from Spaniards. 

Whilst I might say I understand the argument of the opposition, I also understand it's a poor position, and justifications like the ones you give essentially boil down to ""it's different when we do it"", which is an argument from ignorance.

[EDIT: I should also point out - partly in response to posts elsewhere in this topic - that people living in Spain but being officially resident in the UK (i.e. lying to the taxman in both the UK and Spain) is extremely common here. When I first moved to Spain I had two different British accountants in the UK try to persuade me that that is what I should do. One actually gave me a list of things to do to avoid getting caught doing this. Needless to say I did not take this advice and found another accountant - but the upshot is that the number of Brits living Spain is actually much higher than the official (both UK and Spanish) stats would have you believe, and these are people that are using Spanish services but not contributing a penny in taxes in Spain.]",0,1365165179,null,0,1365168212,0,c98zsg2,t3_1bpzjp,t1_c98zsg2,t1_c98zkxs,null,1431664905,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

&gt;Acting in our interests would work pretty well for them. They could selfishly defend us. A world of fully functioning stable markets is extremely beneficial for the U.S. If developed nations are reduced to nuclear waste land, that's bad for business.

&gt;&gt;WW1 was bad for business. So was WW2. The Napoleonic war nearly bankrupted the UK. War is always bad (overall) for business, that is not a convincing argument against the fact that it will occur.

I'm not talking about the act of war. I'm talking about the fact that it would be in the interests of any developed nation with nuclear deterrents, to act as a deterrent on behalf of any nation that it does a lot of business with, therefore their deterrent is our deterrent. Your example there is not relevant, because you are referring to wars where all sides have the same level of technology more or less, and M.A.D. has never been applied to conventional forces. It's also arguable that these wars were good for business. Long term, a nuclear wasteland where formers strong markets will be, will not be good for business. It is massively in the interests of the U.S. that the developed world is not turned into a nuclear wasteland. I just can't see it any other way. How would that be beneficial to the U.S.?

You said nukes are a deterrent to ground invasion. We have the conventional means to defend ourselves from ground invasion from all of the immediate threats. I can't see 20 or 40 years into the future. Fortunately we are able to adapt to events as they develop, instead of making huge outlays now, to try and guess what is going to happen.

The user ought to be aware of that before publishing. This is where a law could actually help - by making services inform the users clearly of how they use their data, and what security surrounds it. If you are publishing your data publically, you relinquish your right to control. That is just common sense. If you release your data within a walled garden, you should have the right to ensure it stays within it.

If the user judges that such controls are not adequate (such as posting a video without DRM and Access Control attached when he wants it private), then they should not post it.

&gt; However, just because there are situations in which the law can't work doesn't mean the law shouldn't be implemented - if necessary, exceptions can be drafted to shield companies from unreasonable liability. 

I'm not so sure here. I think it should be illegal for aliens to destroy our planet. That doesn't mean any EU law preventing them from doing so will have any demonstrable effect. Such laws which are not practicable only serve to undermine the competency/regard of the institution that drafts them. If we want the EU to contain bodies who's laws we wish our governments to actually follow, then we shouldn't encourage anything which is close to batshit insane.

That does not make sense. Nation A invades Nation B and destroys it. Nation C traded with Nation A and Nation B. How does it aid nation Nation C to then destroy the one remaining trading partner they had among the two?

There are many reasons why your argument might work in some situation, but many it might not.

That has no consequence. You never need fire the missiles. They're a deterrent and that's their only practical use. You enemy only has to believe you will fire. 

If you get hit by a nuke, they have failed at their job and you're best off not firing back.

The University doesn't give a shit about you. Seriously. There are few resources available to master's students that need extra help, and about 50% of your professors will tell you to fuck off - not in so many words, but certainly in spirit - if you come to them for help outside of class time. Cass time in which you're meant to compress an entire term's worth of learning into 16 lecture hours for each of your four modules. For comparison, you probably got 24 hours per module (class) in the States.

Your professors will generally be brilliant researchers, but poor teachers. The PhD candidate tutors assigned to your modules are in the same boat, except more arrogant and condescending. 

Cambridge cares about THEORY. Incessant, stupid, impractical theory. Their reaserchers rarely go out into the field for research, but send most of their time digesting, tweaking, and recombining other people's ideas so the end result is mushy academic work of generally poor quality and novelty. As a result, they spend so much time teaching theories, and the stupid academic back-and-forth between competing egos, that the practicality of your education suffers. 

Your cohort will probably be full of sneaky, untrustworthy people that will lie and manipulate to make sure you aren't competing on the curve. Don't believe a word anyone says about the amount of work they are doing, what they are working on, or whether they understand something. If you do, you will probably end up feeling like a complete idiot in the company of people who claim they aren't doing any revision, barely work on assignments, and understand every glorious, illuminating, and insigthful word that comes out of your ineffective professors' mouths, all while getting top marks.

We're being constantly told that we need to be willing to train and look for new work and increasingly, employers are not willing to train us, leaving the onus on us as employees to go out and train ourselves.

The system is essentially saying ""screw you"" to anyone wanting to do that because you're not signing a book saying you're doing nothing. If we actually supported people wanting to do training courses for schemes, I think we would see a much better 'return to work' success rate.

The only reason I can think of just now for that not being allowed is that they genuinely think some people would just spend their life in education and receiving benefits for it. Personally I think that would still contribute more than them sitting at home doing nothing for benefits, but there is a certain hint of malice in the system today that would rather punish people as a form of encouragement.

Democracy and the free market are something that's very hard to take away from a population once you show them it. Most countries on the planet now have some form of free market/democracy. 

With the advent of the internet and global communications it feels like a government wouldn't be able to pull it off like they once could. 

NK is in a lucky position because they started their isolation from the rest of the world before the internet, capitalism and global communications were in place. It's allowed them to keep tight control.

That's not very polite is it?

&gt;The deterrent has worked extremely well since the second country got nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons kept the cold war cold and limited it to a few proxy wars.

You have to make a causal link for me here I'm afraid since I'm so fucking ignorant. It does seem that you're suggesting that  nuclear powers having the ability to send the world into nuclear war prevents nuclear war. Can you show some evidence that economic and regime issues, such as, but not limited to, perestroika, had less impact than nuclear proliferation. The arms race was a symptom of the cold war not it's cause nor it's solution.

&gt;There hasn't been a major conflict in Europe for going on 70 years now.

No argument there, you can't prove that has any more to do with nuclear weapons than economics, the EU, the UN or the IMF.

&gt;It blows my mind that you could say the nuclear deterrent doesn't work when there's not been a single hostile launch since the very first 2 bombs.

Why hasn't a nuclear power launched an attack against a non-nuclear nation then? 

To be honest, I'm not too much of a fan of your patronizing tone, I studied history up to degree level so your 'You are extremely ignorant of history' has annoyed me. Can we talk like adults from now on?

You use the word it as a pronoun. A pronoun is a word which replaces a noun. A pronoun doesn't change the meaning of a sentence it simply shortens the sentence.

We've been linked before and it's possible it's just gossip, but he'd be excellent. He's a goalscorer, and a very mobile one who'd be an excellent complement to Michu, he's someone who can get goals but can also take advantage of Michu's runs into the box, he's good working the channels and playing in teammates. If we can't get him, we should get someone like him because that is by far the weakest part of the team. We probably need 2 new strikers (what with all those cup games). I think we should also try to give Rory Donnelly some play-time before the end of the season.

Next weakest would be a defensive midfielder who actually tackles. We've already been linked with a couple Spanish players - Getafe's Michel and Lacen are 2 that come to mind - who would be great, they'd add additional strength and defensive qualities to the midfield when necessary while not at all being out of place the rest of the time.

Conceded.

&gt;It does seem that you're suggesting that nuclear powers having the ability to send the world into nuclear war prevents nuclear war.

That is exactly what I and many other people think. It might not be the particular theory to subscribe to, but I believe it is the accepted and most popular one. 

It doesn't just prevent nuclear war, it also prevents conventional wars. To date I believe the [Kargil war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kargil_War#WMDs_and_the_nuclear_factor) was the only case of two nuclear powers actually moving towards anything approaching a conventional war. It fizzled out after other nuclear powers stepped in and warned of nuclear retaliation. 

A very clear example of nuclear weapons succeeding as a deterrence.

&gt;The arms race was a symptom of the cold war not it's cause nor it's solution.

The arms race was its solution in a bit of a roundabout way even if you don't subscribe to the theory of MAD and nuclear weapons as a deterrence. The soviets were spending something like 15% of their GDP on their military buildup and it lead to the eventual bankruptcy of the soviet union. The USA and capitalism could sustain the cost, the Soviet and communist system couldn't.

The nature of society is that people come and people go. Part of your argument - that immigration is higher than emigration - may well stem from the fact that the British have historically been an outsider in Europe. We're fortunate in that our language is internationally recognised and operates as a lingua franca for business (for example, it's perfectly possible, as I do - my wife is Dutch - to spend weeks in Holland and barely hear, let alone speak, a word of Dutch).

aftermath of the recession, average incomes have fallen by near-record amounts. Inequality has fallen
back to levels last seen in the mid-1990s. Relative poverty continues to fall, but only because the poverty

On the other hand you could say that only South Korea is still at war with North Korea, because officially the war was just between North Korea and South Korea - everyone else just kinda joined in for the duration of hostilities. Although I think it might be fair to say that the USA is still a part of that war because they still have troops positioned there for that purpose.

Everyone else buggered off a long time ago and if hostilities flared up again it's *very* unlikely that Luxembourg for example would get involved, so just like the UK it's a bit silly to say we are still in that war.

Of course, with comments like David Cameron is making, it does seem like there is a chance the UK would enter such a war again - but I really don't believe every other country that was previously involved and ""is still at war"" would do, therefore I don't think that particular metric is really relevant to the current situation.

Also, otherwise, if you don't accept that this is the case, then wouldn't it also mean that China and Russia are still at war with South Korea?

true,HarryBlessKnapp,eng-GreaterLondon,South Weezey Mandem,"&gt;That does not make sense. Nation A invades Nation B and destroys it. Nation C traded with Nation A and Nation B. How does it aid nation Nation C to then destroy the one remaining trading partner they had among the two?

No one is talking about destroying the remaining nation. You haven't conceptualised what I am actually saying. It's about deterrent. Nation A will be deterred from destroying nation B, because nation C has nuke capability and interests in nation B. It may also have interests in nation A, but what good is a trading/tactical partner that is going around destroying your other trading/tactical partners? How could you assume they wont destroy nations D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K? That's bad for business. Therefore if nation C is to protect its interests, weapons will be pointed at whoever threatens those interests. I don't understand your issue here. Your counterpoint actually wont fit in my head. I don't understand how it is relevant. Not to mention it's a ludicrous closed system of only 3 nations, which makes it even more irrelevant. The argument I put forward is that a global economy of interconnected nation states and markets means it is mutually beneficial that everyone remains in business, therefore any nation launching an attack on any of these nations, they would have to consider that they are making an attack on the whole global economic system, and thus anyone in that global economic system with nuclear capability is going to consider them a threat, and thus this is the deterrent because they immediately become a potential target. Of course if you reduce this to a simple 3 country closed system, and give only 2/3's nuke capability, that argument doesn't really work.

I disagree with the stuff about paying for fun though - the way you describe it, fun sounds like another word for the pub...local authorities usually offer massively discounted rates for the use of leisure centres for those on benefits and that's before volunteering etc. I actually worked full time for 6 months for free!

There seems to be an assumption that benefits include the right to have some fun times, but I don't really understand why this is the case. It's up to LAs to provide these services for the poor without the money just being provided cash in hand. 

In the same way you feel rage at the situation you're in, as someone on a low salary, I'm equally annoyed for different reasons. A walk through my town, which is very poor with numerous Council estates, reveals plenty of bookies and countless pubs. Meanwhile, tons of the houses have sky tv dishes outside.

As I said, you have every right to want what you want.  But to get upset/bothered by what other fans do, and try to force the rest of the fans to obey your demands, is kind of unhealthy, for everyone.

And you are absolutely asking people to repress stuff.  Being ""judicious"" is all about repressing/editing in a way that is less free.  You're asking people to not say very basic news topics.  You're asking tens of thousands of people to go out of their way to either make up clever and intriguing titles rather than just being clear and concise, and then forcing people to open up a link just to see one sentence (which they could have just read on the main page).

Again, you're totally right to want what you want, and to even ask for it.  But if the community, on average, doesn't want to go out of it's way just to please you, don't be too surprised.  But then, you like to be surprised, so maybe it's cool if you're surprised about the Whovian community refusing to tiptoe the few intentionally ignorant Who fans.

It's not like it comes at no cost to them and you have to do something day in, day out. You can't sit at a computer refreshing every five seconds for new jobs, you have to keep sane.

And well I wont lie to you - for me it's weed that I spend my JSA on. I try to better myself in the day while I smoke with learning, reading and application of knowledge. Not to get too off topic but I want to go into business and I want to be self-taught so while i'd like a job (plan was stable job for a year or two and experience having some pocket money before I go it alone) I don't see it as lost time, it's just hard to wake up every morning, do job search, read a few books, check my e-mails for job stuff, cram more info into my head... like most of my friends, I would die for the release of monotonous work at times just for something to do.

I can see how or why people would take issue in me spending JSA on drugs but I am not using JSA as an alternative to work it's just that like everyone I need entertainment, vices, experiences. It sucks that you have to pay for it out of pocket but I don't have many options.

It also doesn't help that the valleys are particularly bad and have been since people decided they didn't want our coal after they destroyed the health of my grandfathers generation and there's a thin air of animosity towards that and sometimes when you see London on the news (or whatever) and it looks largely unaffected by the recession on the outside and in reports it can be particularly infuriating.

It's hugely complex and whatever like you said and a lot of rioters were simply joining in for the sake of wrecking shit up but there is a general undercurrent of truth to the fact they all felt poor and forgotten, the problem is how based in reality it is and the solutions they propose - riots?

I don't really understand your first couple of sentences. Try rephrasing it. If you have a lot of left-wing tendencies, why do you go around calling people lefties all the time? I couldn't understand your explanation above.

You then get on to nationalism. Not sure how you got onto that. I think patriotism is healthy for a nation though. That's why I want us to be as prosperous as possible.

If increased spending would cause this great nation to get on the track to recovery, then as a patriot it is my duty to support. I just want what is best for this country.

true,Machinax,dalek,Dalek,"Keep a few things in mind:

1) Television from the 60s and 70s is completely different to television from the 21st century. I mean, *completely* different. Acting, pacing, plotting, incidental music drew from different influences and had different goals and ideas.

2) *Doctor Who* really pioneered television and popular science fiction, and both mediums have changed a lot over the last generation. 

3) Pick and choose the best Classic serials. Hop on over to /r/gallifrey and ask around. As squiddo said (and I'd suggest the same), watch just the best story from each Doctor - *The War Games*, *Ambassadors of Death*, *Genesis of the Daleks*, *Caves of Androzani*, etc. Those serials have stood the test of time. If you find yourself liking those, you'll be able to make the transition to other serials more easily than if you went in vanilla. Read up on key events and characters on Wikipedia, and make it a point to watch those episodes, so you can see their connections to Revived Who: for example, Davros and Sarah Jane Smith reconnecting in ""Journey's End"" after meeting in *Genesis of the Daleks*. The Doctor mentioning that he tried to help the Silurians from *Doctor Who and the Silurians* in ""The Hungry Earth"", that kind of thing. 

4) Give it time, too. I tried diving into Classic Who a few years ago, and that lasted all of a couple of weeks. After Elisabeth Sladen and Nicholas Courtney passed away, I had a specific plan in mind - watch the stories with them in it, to get a better appreciation for their contributions and influence on *Doctor Who*. 

That helped me watch a few of Patrick Troughton's episodes, all of Jon Pertwee's episodes, and I'm accumulating more of Tom Baker's episodes. And now that I've got more momentum, I don't have to adhere to my plan of watching only Sladen and Courtney's stories. I can see this going on beyond the time Sladen and Courtney stop being regular cast members. 

It's amazing to see how *Doctor Who* evolves. Troughton's stories were black and white, missing, and felt like old episodes of *The Twilight Zone*. Pertwee's era felt very James Bond-ish. The science fiction element is played up more in Tom Baker's stories. ",0,1365178228,null,0,1365183771,0,c993xa4,t3_1bqhp6,t1_c993xa4,t3_1bqhp6,null,1431662956,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,Lordzoot,eng-yorkshire,Leeds,"&gt;Yeah but it's easy to dismiss that as ""bloody scroungers with sky!"" but they are giving up money that could otherwise be spent on more pleasurable food or to travel distances to do stuff.

Replace more pleasurable food with more nutritious food for starters. Travel would be a fine thing for me too, but I can't afford a car. If so many of the poorest elements have sky, and they do where I live (I'm really not trying to make the scrounger argument but...), I'm afraid, there can be few complaints when people suggest the benefits need sorting. 

&gt;You can't sit at a computer refreshing every five seconds for new jobs, you have to keep sane.

Keep sane and volunteer might be a good new catchphrase for Call-me-Dave!

&gt;And well I wont lie to you - for me it's weed that I spend my JSA on.

And that's tragic for two reasons, firstly that your spending it on that (and you're not the only one), but secondly that you feel that's the only release (and you're not the only one). I have a serious problem with the way our government has handled this economic crisis - too many people like yourself are trapped because of an attitude towards austerity which, quite frankly, goes against all common sense economic thinking. I really would recommend getting yourself out there and working for free though - it really did my self-esteem a lot of good, and my CV too. I feel for you though.

&gt;I can see how or why people would take issue in me spending JSA on drugs but I am not using JSA as an alternative to work it's just that like everyone I need entertainment, vices, experiences. It sucks that you have to pay for it out of pocket but I don't have many options.

I appreciate this, but it's not a great argument for maintaining the current system!

&gt;It also doesn't help that the valleys are particularly bad and have been since people decided they didn't want our coal after they destroyed the health of my grandfathers generation and there's a thin air of animosity towards that and sometimes when you see London on the news (or whatever) and it looks largely unaffected by the recession on the outside and in reports it can be particularly infuriating.

Indeed, the economic situation in Wales is shocking. I have a great deal of respect for the generations of mining families that, literally, gave their all to create the country we have today. The government should be ashamed.

Take care.

Trident **does not prevent terrorism** - nuclear convoys are targets for terrorists.

Polaris (precursor to Trident) **did not prevent Argentina invading the Falklands**.

Trident **did not prevent two Gulf Wars** ... what was the ""45 minutes to destruction""^* newspaper hysteria all about?

Only if you're going to do it regardless. Which you were. I'm just saying we should do whatever works out best. And not stick to one regardless. We should cut spending. Reduce borrowing.

Arguing that we should *never* borrow, is detrimental to the UK, and is caring more for an ideology than it is about your country. We should adapt to the circumstances as they change.

That's not what labour did. They ran a massive deficit, even though we were in a boom time. That's fucking insane. That is when you're supposed to run a surplus. They did not sell the gold to try and save us. That is incorrect. And now, in a recession where normally it is wise to spend one's way out, we cannot borrow any more. Otherwise we would be and things wouldn't be so bad. But you are correct, Borrowing is part of what has caused this problem.

true,johnnynohat,null,null,"It depends on whether the duck is 'wild' or not and on the time of year. The Countryside and Wildlife Act 1981 makes it an offence to intentionally kill, injure, or take any wild bird. There are exceptions, however, laid out in Schedule 2 of the Act, so that outside the close season, you can take Tufted duck, Gadwall, Goldeneye, Mallard, Pintail, Pochard, Shoveler, Teal and Wigeon. With the exception of Mallard and Tufted duck, you'd be unlikely to find many of those species on your average duck pond. It's much more likely that any duck you'd find there would actually be domesticated and in the case of these ducks, you are likely to run up against the Theft Act 1968. s.4(4) of the Act states that it is theft to take an animal that is ""tamed"" or ""ordinarily kept in captivity"" (and that is the property of someone else). A duck on a duck pond is likely to be deemed 'tamed' and may be technically 'in captivity' if its wings are clipped. So, in short, if the duck is not wild, you may well be guilty of theft and if it is wild, you could also be guilty of an offence unless the duck is of a particular species and it's outside the close season",0,1365180467,null,0,false,0,c994rsm,t3_1bq8ua,t1_c994rsm,t1_c9900rg,null,1431662557,13,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,13
true,Aluxh,welsh,Wales,"Woah now.

&gt;Replace more pleasurable food with more nutritious food for starters. Travel would be a fine thing for me too, but I can't afford a car. If so many of the poorest elements have sky, and they do where I live (I'm really not trying to make the scrounger argument but...), I'm afraid, there can be few complaints when people suggest the benefits need sorting. 

Uh I was talking buses or trains for example. Where I live you're looking at £7+ to go anywhere with busy streets to almost guarantee something to do if the weather is good. Say I go thrice a week because down to you I have no sky and no recreational activities at home. £21 a week. Conversely I could spend £30 a month on sky and have hundreds of outlets of entertainment with guaranteed something on every channel piped right into my living room.

&gt;And that's tragic for two reasons, firstly that your spending it on that (and you're not the only one), but that you feel that's the only release (and you're not the only one). I have a serious problem with the way our government has handled this economic crisis - too many people like yourself are trapped because of an attitude towards austerity which, quite frankly, goes against all common sense economic thinking. I really would recommend getting yourself out there and working for free though - it really did my self-esteem a lot of good, and my CV too. I feel for you though.

I have tried working for free (as there is very high unemployment in my area it's hard even to work for free right now) and I worked for a year working just about enough to cover travel in promise of more hours, even leaving college on the promise of full time. It cost me £6 to get over there on a bus and I was doing 2-3 hour shifts, sometimes ending past the last bus (8:30PM) meaning my only option was a £20 taxi home. I tried working for a year in hopes it'd work out but it didn't for me and now i'm stuck here.

And you can save the sympathy on my choice of drug thanks. I choose not to drink and to smoke weed instead.

&gt;I appreciate this, but it's not a great argument for maintaining the current system!

And in the following paragraph I go onto say that but what can I do about it? Stop living my life when all I have is free time?

&gt;Indeed, the economic situation in Wales is shocking. I have a great deal of respect for the generations of mining families that, literally, gave their all to create the country we have today. The government should be ashamed.

That I can't argue with.

Have you ever been on benefits for an extended period of time out of work? Is your area like mine? I also got all As and Bs at GCSE and got a few A-C AS Level before my father died and things went a little to shit my last year of school. What about the people in your area less equipped on paper than me? it's easy to demonise people out of work as scroungers and I did it before it was me. It's also easy because being out of work and feeling like you do on JSA for an extended period of time makes you very apathetic. It's not hard to see why Gary down the pub pretends he likes not working to save face instead of pouring his heart out to his 40 year old, bald mates about how hard it is to do nothing all day.

Being unemployed is a full time job in and of itself, both finding work and keeping sane and occupied. I'm not gonna pretend I work harder than someone who's digging ditches for a living but that's a different kind of taxation and one bad situation doesn't make another acceptable.

LAW 4 - THE PLAYERS' EQUIPMENTS

Safety

""A player must not use equipment or wear anything that is dangerous to himself or another player (including any kind of jewellery).""

All chelsea and Torres have to do, is raise concern that if he doesn't continue to wear the mask, it would be a heighten risk for further injury more extreme. And the mask is not a danger to Torres, and nor other players, unless he fucking head butts someone. But even doing so would break several laws of the game.

This move makes sense, actually, if Mou, or anybody else that plays a 4-3-3, returns. Schurrle would offer us forward wing options because we'll have 2 winger spots with Hazard, Moses, Piazon if he returns, arguably Mata (though I personally would play him in the top of an inverted triangle duo alongside Rami because Mata's been so good as a true #10 this year), and Schurrle vying for those winger spots. And Schurrle can track back well too. And then in the engine-box of the midfield we'd have options galore: Essien, Mikel, Romeu, Rami, Oscar (who would probably drop deeper in this scenario), Chalobah, Ake perhaps, Luiz maybe, and McEachran would all fit well into varying options of a midfield three. 

What KDB gives us in this scenario that Schurrle doesn't is varying depth - he's very capable of going out wide and playing winger but also playing the Lampard role in a midfield 3. So it really depends on what manager comes in and what formation they'd play, but TBH this move looks like a cater-to-a-potential-Mourinho-formation buy.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"Nobody is even trying to argue that the UK should cut off EU trade.  Certainly not UKIP; they advocate negotiating a trade agreement, per article 50, and *then* leaving.

------------




&gt;**And we'd take no part in setting all the trading rules, the safety rules, the marketing rules, the labour rules.**

- Well, yes, you get a contribution but not a vote - as it stands, (the UK could easily negotiate one above what Iceland and Lichtenstein have negotiated whilst still making a net contribution) - that's if we buy off the rack without even having to negotiate.

- The Bruges Group estimate that a 75% reduction in EU regulations would result in a 3.5% growth to UK GDP.  Put it into context, What would be similar EEA-Iceland has only signed ~10% of EU regulations.  The Bruges Group has worked out how the UK could legally adopt this stance in WEEKS, not months or years.  It could happen and there'd be an influx.

- Many of the regulations already exist, or are really good ideas.  Adopt the best; lose the rest.

- The UK has one of the best records in holding to regulations, many just ignore them (see ECJ) - Finland is pretty much alone in shaming the UK in terms of adopting and adhering to regulations.  Lots of countries ignore.  The UK even voted to allow France and Germany to break ERM2 without being fined, and that's a bound beyond simple regulations.  

- In return of accepting this 10% of regulations (which the recent Icesave/EFTA court case shows there is plenty of room of interpretation - so not beholden), it means that in balance a country also gets the rights to a seat on the WTO and the ability to negotiate its own trade terms globally.  Plus sovereignty.  Plus control of agriculture and fishing.   

&gt;**We tried trading from outside the EU. Most of our manufacturing industry disappeared.**

BULLSHIT.  Not only is the UK still one of the largest global  manufacturers, but nobody is saying that the UK would cease trading within the EU.  Outside, if Switzerland can negotiate a free trade deal with Commonwealth Canada before the UK, if Iceland can be in final talks with China for a free trade agreement, specialised UK does not need the homogenised EU.


AND WHEN DID WE TRY TRADING OUTSIDE THE EU????

We've been in it since it came into existence.   Don't try arguing that the current EU is somehow the same svelte shape as the EEC of yore, or the Rome Statute.

true,Fran1878,newcr-1,"Come on Everton, these are shite!","I'm surprised nobody has mentioned Steven Naismith as one of the most dispensable yet. He's a squad player at best, and apart from a few goals this year, I really don't think he's a good player. He was great against Liverpool, not just for the goal, but I don't remember him losing the ball, and some of his link up play with Coleman was great, but ever since, he's been poor. He loses the ball often and isn't skilful enough to have an impact on the game. One thing you can count on him for though is his tracking back, he's gets stuck in to be fair, and at times offers decent protection for our full backs.

Neville is in the same category. I love the man to bits and am thankful for everything he has done for the club, but sometimes your time is up and you've got to move on. Tim Cahill moved on when he wasn't up to scratch with the rest of the club, but we still love him for his services. Neville would get the same respect. He's a great leader, but he's not good enough to be in our squad anymore. It's gotten to the point where he's limited to playing one two's, and even then you fear for the worst (Wigan's second goal)

As for the least dispensable, it will have to be Baines and Fellaini. For Baines to be one of the most creative players in the world from left back is an astounding achievement, and if you take him out of the squad, we'd suffer from a lack of clear chances, as it is widely know our left side is the strongest part of our team, and that's without mentioning how good Leighton is at actually defending!

As for Fellaini, I think this goes without saying. Despite the questionable attitude, his ability to dictate games so comfortably would be missed by any side. His control and distribution of the ball is brilliant, and your team is always going to profit from a players ability to defend from the front so effectively, I've never seen a player win the ball in the opposition half so much. Fellaini is the complete package. Control, passing, defending, finishing, heading, he has it all, and if he does go in the summer, we should get a hefty sum for his transfer.",0,1365186151,null,0,false,0,c996wkj,t3_1bluxs,t1_c996wkj,t3_1bluxs,null,1431661552,3,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,3

If you already smoke weed from time to time, and so break the law, why would it becoming legal make you use it more often? You've already made a choice to break the law by smoking it occasionally. In the eyes of the law you're just as bad as someone who smokes it every day. If you like the effect of the drug, and have made your own decision about if it's good or bad, why is the law effecting you? It becoming legal wouldn't change the drug at all, it's still what it always was, it just means the governments opinion on the drug has changed - where as you'd already made your mind up that it was nice to smoke weed before hand. So why is the law or class of drug affecting your views and usage?

IMO, people know the 'bad' drugs like Heroin are 'worse' than things like Weed, but it's not the classification that affects users choice to use or not - it's what the drug does. People don't use hard drugs like Heroin because they don't want the negative side effects or to become addicted. They don't avoid the drug because it's been labelled class A.

Stats cant show work rate so i wont quote them, you can win the ball back by chasing a player around half the pitch or by him running into you while you laze about. I think if you ask any football fan who watches both players theyll tell you that RVP doesnt work as hard, i'm not slagging off RVP it's just not part of his game. Stats arent everything especially in this award, both for RVP and against. I would say van persie is a ridiculously good finisher, but doesnt exactly light games on fire. For instance FA cup against west ham, incredibly quiet then turns up scores a cracking finish, this is great and every team wants a player like this, but it doesnt make him the best player in the EPL. Suarez does things that amaze me in every area of his game, he dribbles through areas you wouldnt have imagined possible, scores unbelievable free kicks, scores wondergoals, plays world class passes, not a bad finisher himself, has fantastic technique and touch, plays with passion, flair and doesnt stop running, plays almost every game be it man utd or mansfield. Also your stats need to be interpreted, suarez loses the ball more because he dribbles more and is more adventurous, he gambles more, his pass completion is slightly lower because he plays more difficult passes.

It is true that the Bild is an awful tabloid like the sun, the language it uses is similar to the Sun and co. 

But  unless British tabloids like the Sun, Mirror or the Mail, they are well connected with German Clubs. 

Don't get me wrong, it is not like they wouldn't lie in their articles. Afterall they only want to sell more papers and with the language they use it really can become quite hard to extract the information.

In the Schürrle - De Bruyne article they use words like possible, apparently and such, which usually means that the rumour doesn't hold as much truth than the article suggested. 

But another German Paper (*Der Express* )released a similar story at the same time. 

It didn't mention a permanent transfer for De Bruyne, but €26 million and a 1 year +x loan of de Bruyne for Schürrle. 

And with 2 papers claiming that KDB will be somehow involved in a Schürrle transfer it does look way more realistic. 

Still the Bild rumour of a permanent transfer of KDB and cash for Schürrle seems silly and you probably shouldn't pay too much attention to it. 

I still won't understand why Chelsea is interested in Schürrle.

If you are under 18 you are automatically eligible for assistance either through your councils homeless team or social services. If you are under 16 you are most definitely eligible for assistance via social services.

Once you are 18 and if you have been housed by social services or a homeless housing team, you are automatically eligible for housing and in priority need. The council has a legal duty to house you at this point.

I would be very interested to know any local council that is actively turning away children or people under 18.

Why is there an assumption we'd use nuclear weapons to indiscriminately target a civilian population? They could very well be used to target the nuclear infastructure of a hypothetical enemy to remove their nuclear (or other WMD) capabilities. Most countries tend not to put missile silos and airbases in the suburbs of major cities.

Nuclear weapons are the most destructive weapons in our arsenal, but they're nowhere near as destructive as movies/the media have us believe. Certainly not to the point whereby you'd be annihilating ""millions of people"" with one or two targetted strikes at a nations military infastructure.

Heres a (morbidly) fun little site which lets you select a target and yield and see the rough extent of the damage said device would cause.

Out of interest I tried sticking a Trident warhead on our naval base at HMNB Clyde (where our nuclear subs are berthed).

Glasgow itself would be unaffected by the explosion. Some people would suffer from the effects of radiation obviously and there would be lasting effects, which is why they're a weapon of last resort, but it definitely wouldn't be the ""murder of countless innocents"" like you implied.

The British Empire was at its height in 1921, two years after the Second World War. 

Now, I really hope you're not being serious about saving us in WW2. To be blunt you didn't. By the time you joined, the RAF had beaten the RAF in the Battle of Britain, making a Nazi invasion even more impossible. Even if they had crossed the Channel, they'd have to fight through tens of thousands of British and Commonwealth soldiers, as well as the remnants of the Polish , French, Belgian, Dutch, Norwegian and Danish armies. 

Sure it's likely that you'd win today, but only because of money and numbers. Whilst the USA have the largest navy and airforce, there is no doubt that the better trained forces are on the other side of the Atlantic. Declaring war on us would mean losing every ally you have in Europe, as well as Australia and New Zealand. The fact that the best American soldiers are the one trained by the SAS/SBS shows who the dangerous ones really are, not your knuckle dragging, mouth breathing marines.

true,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"This sounds like a slightly flimsy definition of when minors should have the names published in conjunction with sentencing. You've already added a lot of exceptions to your original idea.

Fundamentally I do not like people's name being published for crimes they have committed in the past. The media in the 21st century is shit. It names people as rapist, paedophiles and murders without evidence and no one can ever live that down. The media is not fare to individuals. I think that absolute dicks like these two should be given hard prison sentences, but I believe it is fundamentally wrong to use the media as a form of punishment.

Use punishment by all means, but use a form of punishment that is fare and/or equal. The judge cannot control how much the media will damage some one's life. They can very easily determine how much a prison sentence will damage some one's life and adjust accordingly.

I'm prepared to make certain exceptions to this rule, but those are only for things where the public should know, for their own safety and even then I'm not sure the media is appropriate, but that's getting onto a vastly different issue which I haven't thought about so much. Which is why I say ""I am prepared to make exceptions"", as opposed to ""these are some exceptions"".

One last note on media. Once some one becomes famous for what ever reason, they could quite possibly be famous for life. So if they become famous for some thing bad (like being a paedophile), their *entire* lives are effectively ruined. I'm not sure certain sentences deserve their lives being ruined.

As I mentioned before, I think the trade off for the 'peace of mind' in a nuclear free world would actually be a world that was much more violent day to day. Obviously it is up to all countries to assess that risk and make a choice. Right now though I would choose the nuclear deterrant option any day.

Deep down, now the barriers to nuclear technology have come down so much, I suspect we will never live in a nuclear free world and must simply accept that is the future nature of conflict. Even if a country like the US disarmed (which is almost inconcievable given their prediliction for all things firepower) the barriers to prevent them simply re-engineering a new set of devices at short notice are so low as to be insignificant.

The brevity of the human life lends perspective and drive that maybe a 900 year old Timelord desires or respects. 

The most important thing to consider is that the Doctor is essentially immortal - and while he risks his life constantly in the name of others because he feels responsible (great power/great responsibility) when a human being with no sense of immortality - no assurance they'll survive - when that human being puts their life on the line for somebody or something they care about at such a higher risk than the Doctor is ever at (personally)...

Without the minimum wage, without any protections, we might as well revert to Victorian society, or earlier, perhaps feudalism.

Working 60 hours a week is essentially two jobs, for one person - when there simply isn't enough low-skill work that needs to be done for everyone to have a 30hr/week job in the first place. I'm sure if you allowed employers to pay 50p an hour, or gave private companies free taxpayer funded labour through the work programme there would some holes to be dug and refilled - but that's not very efficient is it?

look at the number of chances suarez creates, RVP isn't on the scale.

http://www.eplindex.com/29380/premier-leagues-top-players-scorers-chance-creators-assists-possession-wins.html

and there are the attacking stats.

ther reason that RVP has a higher dribble % is because he averages under 2 a game. Whereas Suarez averages about 9. 
Also is that your only quibble with what i said earlier if so, i think you're having a hard time arguing that RVP should get POTY in front of Suarez. You can't honestly believe that RVP has been better than Suarez this season? I've talked about this with man utd, chelsea and arsenal fans they all think it's between suarez and bale.

true,2dTom,null,null,"This will have a quick explaination of each flag from left to right, indicating dates and why it was dated as such.

Strictly speaking, the ""Australian"" flag was only accepted as the national flag after 1901, and would not have appeared as a separate flag prior to this. The the British style ensign flag was only designed in 1900 and approved by Edward VII in 1901 (Assuming this is an official publication). 

The inclusion of a separate Tasmanian flag is an anomaly, possibly caused by the nature of the Australian ""Red Ensign"" flag designed for use as a civil ensign.

The Flag of New Zealand does not show enough detail to date the flag, and may be any flag from the Blue Ensign (Unofficial, though commonly used beginning 1867) to the current Flag of New Zealand (officially adopted 1902).

The flag of Canada narrows the date down further (especially considering that this is a publication housed in the University of British Columbia). The Flag indicated here is the Red Ensign with Canadian Composite Shield (or Canadian Red Ensign), which began use in 1870, and as used in an official capacity between 1892 and 1921, when the Canadian Composite Shield was replaced with the Canadian coat of arms.

The flag of India is not an official flag representing Imperial India in this picture. This flag is the Flag of the governor general of India, as Imperial India did not have a flag separate to that of the Union Jack (Though the red ensign defaced with the Star of India was sometimes used). Since the Governor General was an official colonial position, this image would clearly predate Indian independance (1947).

Much like the Flag of New Zealand, the Flag of the Straights Settlements doesn't contain enough detail on this flag to accurately date it beyond the range of the Straights Settlements as a British colony (1867 - 1946)

I can't find a lot of information the the Flag of East Africa used in this illustration, other than the fact that it may be referencing the Red Ensign of the Imperial British East Africa Company (Founded 1888). Strictly speaking this is not the flag for the East Africa Protectorate (1895-1920). However, this flag may have been used in an unofficial capacity before the transfer of East Africa from the Foreign office to the Colonial office in 1902 (This is however just speculation).

The Flag of Newfoundland is not significant because everyone knows Newfoundland isn't a real place. Seriously though, the Red Ensign was the flag of Newfoundland through to 1904, when The Red and Blue Ensigns with the Great Seal of Newfoundland in the fly became the dominion's official flags until 1931. This dates the Illustration some time after 1904.

The Flag of South Africa, in this form, indicates that this illustration comes from after 1910, after the various colonies that formed South Africa became one. This Flag (The Red Ensign defaced with the Shield of South Africa) was never an official flag, but was the de facto flag of the new colony. Strictly speaking the flag displayed in this picture was only used until 1912, when the Shield of South Africa was placed in a white circle on the Red Ensign, though this flag too was unofficial.

Therefore the most clear I can be is that the illustration must date between 1910 (Based on the South African Flag) and 1921 (Based on the usage of the Canadian Red Ensign). 

TL;DR some time between 1910-1921

ALSO:The Flag of the British Indian Ocean Territory is probably the coolest looking flag of any British colony

Absolute horseshit, I never said anything of the sort.

And while I know nobody has actually said that, from some of the stupidity of responses I've seen today (including one person who has told me that jobs that would pay less than minimum wage ""shouldn't exist"") it's only a matter of time.

I don't think now is the right time to increase the minimum wage. Companies will hire less people, unemployment will increase. If we weren't in a recession (or a depression, looking at this realistically) this might not be the case, because if people were confident enough they would spend that extra cash in shops and so those shops could hire more people. However the reality is that people will not spend that extra money, they'll save it for 'the winter.'

Dont need to have the eu to do this, countries that are allies could easily facilitate this.

&gt;2. Trade, our biggest trading partner is the EU, imagine the loss of revenue from companies based in the UK.
The countries under the rule of the eu are our biggest trading partners and we dont have free trade under the eu globally. So this could be done better without the eu.

&gt;3. In the future, the UK will be left behind the upcoming economies of developing countries, if we want to continue being a influential power, we need the EU.
Behind Greece, italy, cyprus &amp; spain? Just to name a few seriously struggling countries given bailout after bailout with no real solution. Yes im sure we'll be left behind those that are within the single currency.

They need their staff to be alive. They need people who are not dead. The cost of keeping their staff alive is the bare minimum of ""what they are worth"". The only reason they would be able to pay less would be if the government uses taxes to keep their staff alive for them.

The dead cannot work. Therefore people are, at the very minimum, worth whatever it costs to keep alive. 

It is the government's responsiblity to keep people alive, it is *not* the government's responsibility to provide subsidised labour.

If the government, and welfare, disappeared tomorrow, people would need to make enough money to stay alive - even if it meant working 18 hour days. The bare minimum of what someone is ""worth"" to an employer is how much they need to turn up to work the next day.

Nah, i'm just an Australian confused by why there was a separate Tasmanian flag on the image, and so I decided to investigate all of the flags. I'm actually really fascinated by colonial history so this was a lot of fun.

true,NervousEnergy,eng-yorkshire,Welshman in Yorkshire,"So my Mother has been clammering on about this for the last few days. She runs a local Geneology Society, and recently received a letter in the post from the National Library of Wales, which was demanding a copy of the Society's published documents, as per the law, but also requesting access to the Society website for archival purposes. 

Their website includes a ""Members Area"" for members who pay a yearly fee, with access to the usual family history type stuff...

Now my Mother is really worried that the National Library will be able to demand access to content ""beyond the paywall"", as said in the BBC article, thus kinda making the website pointless, as interested members could just go to the National Library and view the content without ever paying the society. 

I'm pretty adamant that as the webmaster, my Mother can refuse to give access to Members-only content to the Library. But considering all published works in the UK are legally requisitioned by the National Library Depositaries, I'm not sure how this applies to websites and paywalls. 

On another note, does anyone find it really fucking worrying that they are boasting about archiving public tweets and facebook posts? I'd argue a big chunk of these posts are not public domain as the people probably didn't set their privacy settings correctly, and never intended the posts to be public. Surely the National Libraries won't be able to ask permission of all the posts they want to archive? 

What about my public forum posts on UK forums from when I was 14 years old? I don't particularly want *them* archived. 

What about websites that have a robots.txt that specifically forbids website crawling? Will they be archived? I can't actually find a damn policy document on this thing, which kinda worries me. 

And how can it be legal to get stuff from beyond the paywall? My Mother is now paranoid that eventually we'll be required to hand over webmaster passwords so that these institutions can archive private content too. Is that realistic? 

What does /r/UK think about this stuff? Seems to be it could really raise some privacy issues. ",0,1365198243,null,0,false,0,c99bfdx,t3_1brehw,t1_c99bfdx,t3_1brehw,null,1431659349,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,trasofsunnyvale,lfc12,,"I'm not sure those stats are that important.  LS creates a chance every 33 minutes and RVP does every 48 minutes.  I've never heard of the stat ""clear-cut chance"" and am wondering where you got that information.  

Otherwise, Suarez scores a goal every 122 minutes and RVP does every 126 minutes, despite Suarez playing 280 more minutes this year, which would actually skew his minutes-per-goal stat a bit to his detriment (RVP has been subbed on 3 times and been subbed off 4 times compared to LS's 2 times he's been subbed off, so Suarez has been playing the full 90 far more often).  

I'm also unsure of where you're getting your final third passing percentage.  WhoScored and Opta don't provide that information, but Opta does show Suarez having a higher accuracy rate in the opponents half--73% versus 67% from RVP.

Suarez also has just under 70 more duels won than RVP (193 to 124) and has over twice as many lost (317 to 149), which, to me, is a huge indicator that Suarez is trying to do things himself far more than RVP, and would back up the notion that Van Persie has been far more reliant on the creativity of his teammates.

Lastly, I'm unsure what ""chance conversion"" is.  Does that refer to the chances he's finished himself or the conversion of all of the chances they've created?  Surely you'd see that, either way, the conversion rate matters little when Suarez has created 82 chances to RVP's 50, and has scored more goals.

I capped the two players' Opta stats in comparison from Liverpool's website, in case you'd like to see them.

true,Uniform764,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"It's complicated. Theres a good chance that a conventional missile could be sufficient, if it was a crude nuclear warhead mounted on a Scud type launcher for example. A Tomohawk would be more than capable of destroying said launch vehicle and missile, assuming we knew where it was to target. 

However out nuclear deterrant Trident has major advantages over conventional weapons.

Firstly and most obviously, destructive power, conventional missiles like Tomohawk are capable of destroying many targets, minimising the need for a nuclear strike, however they are significantly less destructive than nuclear warheads. Most nations are wise enough to store their nuclear arsenel safely, usually in reinforced underground bunkers/silos, which are well defended against or even impervious to conventional weaponry and even ""normal"" bunker busters, which is why America developed the 30,000lb ""Massive Ordanance Penetrator"", to strike such bunkers. Nuclear weapons, being an order of magnitude more destructive than any conventional weapons in our arsenal are much more likely to guarantee significant damage or destruction of a hardened target like a silo, should the need arise.

That theory wouldn't work against a submarine launched nuke, which is why we use them, you can't eliminate the threat with a first strike if you don't know where it is, but luckily only China, France, Russia, the Uk and the US have those and those are rational actors we know aren't going to launch preemptively for little to no reason, so we'll ignore those.

Secondly range. Trident (and other ICBM/SLBMs) have a range of several thousand miles, meaning we can launch on most targets with a few minutes/hours notice, wheras conventional strikes would require aircraft or ships ""relatively"" close (within 2000 miles, to give you a ballpark figure) to the target, which may not be possible. You could of course put a conventional warhead on a Trident missile with a little investment, but such a strike would look identical on radar to a nuclear one, and the risk of confusion was deemed too high, so we left it as a purely nuclear system.

Overall, I think our Nuclear Deterrant does it's job. We spend a lot less than the other major nuclear powers, we have a lot less missiles and a lot less warheads. Our warheads are less powerful than the biggest ones in the US and Russian arsenals aswell for example. It serves it's purpose as ""the minimum effective nuclear deterrent as the ultimate means to deter the most extreme threat.""",0,1365199200,null,0,1365200175,0,c99brd6,t3_1bpqmf,t1_c99brd6,t1_c99b294,null,1431659192,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,NervousEnergy,eng-yorkshire,Welshman in Yorkshire,"So my Mother has been clammering on about this for the last few days. She runs a local Geneology Society, and recently received a letter in the post from the National Library of Wales, which was demanding a copy of the Society's published documents, as per the law, but also requesting access to the Society website for archival purposes. 

Their website includes a ""Members Area"" for members who pay a yearly fee, with access to the usual family history type stuff...

Now my Mother is really worried that the National Library will be able to demand access to content ""beyond the paywall"", as said in the BBC article, thus kinda making the website pointless, as interested members could just go to the National Library and view the content without ever paying the society. 

I'm pretty adamant that as the webmaster, my Mother can refuse to give access to Members-only content to the Library. But considering all published works in the UK are legally requisitioned by the National Library Depositaries, I'm not sure how this applies to websites and paywalls. 

On another note, does anyone find it really fucking worrying that they are boasting about archiving public tweets and facebook posts? I'd argue a big chunk of these posts are not public domain as the people probably didn't set their privacy settings correctly, and never intended the posts to be public. Surely the National Libraries won't be able to ask permission of all the posts they want to archive? 

What about my public forum posts on UK forums from when I was 14 years old? I don't particularly want *them* archived. 

What about websites that have a robots.txt that specifically forbids website crawling? Will they be archived? I can't actually find a damn policy document on this thing, which kinda worries me. 

And how can it be legal to get stuff from beyond the paywall? My Mother is now paranoid that eventually we'll be required to hand over webmaster passwords so that these institutions can archive private content too. Is that realistic?

true,disposableheroes,null,null,"&gt;Trident is a US designed system (although notably wholly independent - ie. we at no stage need US authorisation to use). Therefore its built for us and its cheaper. We provide a submarine platform and they provide the missile system.

It's not **wholly** independent though... we depend on [Kings Bay, Georgia USA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Submarine_Base_Kings_Bay) for parts for Trident.

It is allegedly ""operationally"" independent - but there have been some difficult questions been asked about the independence of the control systems from the USA. 
e.g. The accuracy of Trident depends on the submarine’s position being precisely determined. This is achieved using two systems: GPS, which relies on satellites, and the Electrostatically Supported Giro Navigation System (ESGN). In both cases, UK Trident submarines uses the same system as the US Navy submarines.  The USA has the ability to deny access to GPS at any time, rendering that form of navigation and targeting useless if the UK were to launch without US approval and the US Navy supplies local gravitational information and forecasts of weather over targets, both of which are vital to high missile accuracy, to US and UK submarines.

You don't know where it is but it's out there. This sub has a certain volume of nukes. If you launch an attack against us, this submarine has orders from the prime minister guiding one man in his response. It is ultimately up to him to determine how to respond. You do not know this man. He might fire everything at your civilian population. He might fires solely at military targets. He might pull into Sydney harbour and surrender his vessel to Australia. You do not know.

Honestly I think this is the first time I've heard him sound as though he feels part of the club. I've always hated how miserable he looks on the pitch, but in the interview it sounds like it's really just the weight of unmet expectation and his relationship with the club is fine. 

With Ba starting to settle and Torres approaching 20 goals, I would be fine with him still being here next season provided we get a third striker for the campaign - which I would be happy to see as Lukaku. I also think Falcao and Cavani are extraordinarily expensive so I wouldn't be too upset to see us keep that cash... though I'd be as excited as the next guy if one came.

My duties are basically to represent the young people of South Down, sorting out any issues they might have on a local level, whilst lobbying and campaigning on their behalf for issues at a regional or national level. In a way we mirror the work of MPs or MLAs in that we almost do 'surgery work' for our constituents. 

I like to describe us as more of a pressure group, as we naturally have no legislative power, and achieve change by lobbying and partnering with outside organisations. Our ability to execute change is made greater, however by our close links to our politicians, as we are the official 'Youth Parliament'.

This quote from you is the crux of our disagreement. You were attempting to shift the blame onto the Leeds fans who died (and let's be clear, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that the guys who were killed had anything to do with pissing on the flag or any of the other incidents that likely occurred). The blame lies entirely with those who committed the act. Nobody forced a knife into their hands.

Murder is obviously not an acceptable response, and never is. But how uneducated do you have to be to not know that it would be the unavoidable response? Do people in Leeds not know that Eastern Europeans are fanatically nationalistic? Why would the Leeds fans do this knowing the reaction it would cause from the behalf of Turks? Look, I understand that all this doesn't make any sense to you, but to put this in perspective for you, pissing on a Turkish flag in front of Turkish nationalists will cause the same kind of reaction as would raping their mothers. 

Why do I think Leeds fans should take upon themselves most of the responsibility for these actions? I don't see that much of a difference between being the person who knowingly causes a murder then being the one committing it. Maybe not in front of the law, but the Leeds fans who did this and are back in England now should carry the guit of the death of Kev and Chris, like the man who did commit these stabbings and went to jail for it. As a Galatasaray fan I have my conscience clear about this. The man who committed this violence was not even part of a Galatasaray hooligan group, he was just some ultra-nationalist and an heroin user.

Well, I am not in any position to tell you why you should do anything. But here's why I care about the UKYP, and why I think we have a chance at doing something good. 

I know in Northern Ireland it can very often seem like there is no point whatsoever in the politics. It too often devolves into tribal divides, there is so little discussion about true social or economic issues, little left-right divisions and we tend to run every election like a border poll. 

I think this will take a generational change to overcome. Young people nowadays (for the mostpart) are much more concerned with EMA cuts, Jobs, Social issues such as gay marriage than what flag you fly or what creed you hail from. I firmly believe that our generation will be the first to have the opportunity to bring real, bread and butter politics to Northern Ireland. When we replace the 'old guard' I think things will start to develop for the better. 

The UKYP allows us to gain skills and experience at this young age, fosters the participation and interest in politics, discussion and democracy that is needed to ensure there are people there to replace the old guard when the time comes. Not only that, but young people currently have no electoral say: This gives us a strong, potentially very lucrative connection to politicians to ensure young people ARE listened to, to make sure their issues ARE being dealt with. 

Thats the big picture. In terms of what I can realistically do for you. I will do my very best to make sure your issues are brought to the top, I will lobby effectively and strongly. I will utilise my connections with not only our MLAs/MPs, but with groups like PIPs, GSA, the Youth Councils/Forums, Generation Innovation, Amnesty International to develop projects that can improve things for young people. 

As for me personally, I like to think I have proven I have the skills to do these things already. I led my school's Student Council as Chairman for two years, during which time we raised over £1,500 for our EcoDrive project. I revitalised a council which was beginning to flounder slightly, and developed it into a serious force within the school. I am currently chair of our schools Formal Committee, as well as Head of PR and Marketing at Mourne Youth Council - both of which have given me great experience at running and developing campaigns. 

What I am basically saying is you should care because I can and will deliver. And if you don't care about who I am personally - go find out who the MYP for your area is. (if it is South Down - give me a chance!) Or at least go and support the UKYP in general. its a fantastic organisation.

You are coming close to the line here, friend. Please watch your tone.

&gt;As a Galatasaray fan I have my conscience clear about this

You will note that I have explicitly stated that I do not blame Galatasaray fans as a whole for what happened. I blame the man (and potentially others, there were doubts raised that he was the only one, but I digress) who took it upon himself to stab the Leeds fans. What you are doing is victim blaming, and I wholeheartedly disagree with you on that point. And I do actually hope that whoever provoked the Turkish fans feels some guilt over their actions, but as is the case with the hooligan minority of football clubs, I doubt this will have happened. Either way, as I stated, in my opinion your biggest mistake here is to try and make your point on the anniversary of the murders.

Military action at some point may well be necessary, but surely any war with any basis in lies is a lesson so recently learnt, that the public would immediately be suspicious of statements like these. Unfortunately, I don't think they will be.

His party has applied this strategy to nearly every political issue since they came to power, and sadly it appears to work. They seem to consistently rely on ""A lie can be halfway round the world before the truth has got its boots on.""

These days I hear more casual racism from neighbours, co-workers and family about immigration, hateful ignorant comments about how the disabled should not get welfare, blame being thrown at the unemployed for the state of the economy etc than at any time in my 30 odd years of living in this country. Most of these opinions, seeded by snippets like these, are easily disproved with facts or any basic analysis (which are of course, much less widely reported or visible than the original statements).

It makes me pretty fucking depressed how easily so many people are transformed into rabid, hateful bigots with just a few carefully chosen and distributed bullshit soundbites like this one (and aside from the odd porn link, a great deal of care IS taken).

true,Lordzoot,eng-yorkshire,Leeds,"&gt;Uh I was talking buses or trains for example. Where I live you're looking at £7+ to go anywhere with busy streets to almost guarantee something to do if the weather is good. Say I go thrice a week because down to you I have no sky and no recreational activities at home. £21 a week. Conversely I could spend £30 a month on sky and have hundreds of outlets of entertainment with guaranteed something on every channel piped right into my living room.

Equally though, you could go to your local library and rent a book for a free. I'd have no issue with subsidised bus travel for those on benefits, by the way. I just don't like the idea of the money being cash in hand.

&gt;And you can save the sympathy on my choice of drug thanks. I choose not to drink and to smoke weed instead.

Actually, my statement wasn't based on it being weed, more the fact that you describe yourself as resorting to it. I'm pretty liberal with regard to drugs, actually (although wouldn't do them myself) - I wouldn't be more comfortable if it were alcohol. 

&gt;And in the following paragraph I go onto say that but what can I do about it? Stop living my life when all I have is free time?

That's your decision for sure.

&gt;Have you ever been on benefits for an extended period of time out of work?

No, I wasn't eligible for JSA at first, as I was working one day a week which gave me just enough income to mean I couldn't claim. Although they waited till I'd signed on to tell me that! After that I worked for free whilst living at home and didn't sign on, because there was no guarantee of a job where I was volunteering (although I enjoyed the work), and quite frankly, I thought the job center would complicate matters.

&gt;Is your area like mine?

No, your area is significantly worse (from my understanding of Wales' economic issues)

&gt;I also got all As and Bs at GCSE and got a few A-C AS Level before my father died and things went a little to shit my last year of school.

It figures, you're smart. If it's any consolation, grades don't mean shit in the long run.

&gt;What about the people in your area less equipped on paper than me? it's easy to demonise people out of work as scroungers and I did it before it was me.

I'm not demonising all job seekers though, I'm fully aware of the economic climate. I'm just saying there has to be balance in the argument about benefits - the conversation we're having shows things aren't as tight as they could be.

&gt; It's also easy because being out of work and feeling like you do on JSA for an extended period of time makes you very apathetic.

Absolutely.

Although the country is geographically in central Europe, it was a communist state as Czechoslovakia from 1948 until 1989, was a part of the Eastern Bloc and a member of the Warsaw Pact.

Of course it is now 2013, the Czech Republic is a capitalist democracy and a member of the EU, but for this post, I chose to refer to it as an Eastern European country, a diplomatic mission in Pyongyang from a CEE isn't surprising.

Most of the Big Finish ones are fully performed with a full cast, and as many of the original cast as they are able to get their hands on. There are audio books as well.

&gt;apparently stars mostly the 5-7th Doctors

Big Finish is pretty much Doctors 4-8. 

&gt; or do some have 9/10/11

Not that I know of. There are audio books of 9/10/11, some 10/11 ones are read by the actual cast. I know Freema has done quite a few, and David and Matt have done a handful as well. There are also a couple out there read by Stuart Milligan (he played Richard Nixon in series 6)

&gt;Are there any audio plays other than the Big Finish ones?

Yes.

&gt;How canon are the audio plays considered to be?

As canon as you want, I suppose. Different people have different opnions about it. The radio plays build on the old series, imo.

Can't talk about the nanny state, that's overreacting.


Well, this is what you get. Politicians would rather meet with lobbyists than constituents, the EU demands budget increases while destroying other countries economies, immigration into this country (whether its good or bad) is unchecked from eastern Europe, the taxes on everyone are too high and government spending is even higher. These are the issues most people care about, and maybe UKIP doesn't have all the answers but at least they're talking about the problems.

P.S. I'm a ukip member (and I'm not an old racist man)

P.P.S I don't think immigration is necessarily a bad thing, I just think we should be in control of it.
