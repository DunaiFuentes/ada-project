true,[deleted],null,null,"A couple of things strike me about your posts to be brutally honest.

- Your life does not lack a blog, it lacks a job and you should put all of your effort into that. A blog is not going to get you anywhere. 

- It's really not clear what you want to do, what are you qualified in. Don't try to get your old job back it sounds like despite the injustice you are not going to be welcome. Focus your energy on something that will get you somewhere longer term. If you have trouble in more than one place then look at your own behaviour. 

- The amount of benefits that people apparently get in Australia sound ludicrous - and I don't know if maths is your strong point but it is absolutely not affordable in the UK. Blogging about why you should get more benefits is not going anywhere - and not even being a UK national I'm really not sure many people will agree that you should be getting any whatsoever. I'm pretty sure I can't rock up to Australia and live on benefits. 

- Your issue on the bus and the crime in your area sounds grim - but it is absolutely not the problem of the job centre or your employer. It is up to you to get to work and back however you see fit. The fact that there are grim places with crime is apparent to everyone that has to live in them - but they are still expected to get themselves to work.

""Our key policies

The Green Party will fight for change in these key ways:


Maintaining public spending on the services that we all need.

The government needs to invest to maintain jobs and help to ensure that we don't fall into a double-dip recession.
  
Building the pressure for a real global initiative to tackle climate change. 

We will press for a fair, ambitious and legally binding agreement to cut carbon emissions and insist that Britain leads the way in developing renewable energy technologies. 

Campaigning for more green jobs

Cutting unemployment by creating one million jobs.

We propose major initiatives to improve public transport and provide free insulation in every home, which could save each family around £150 a year in fuel bills.
  
Calling for the cancellation of the planned Trident replacement.

We are fundamentally opposed to wasting billions of public money on this deadly and unnecessary weapon.

Nuclear weapons should have no place in Britain's future.

 
Giving every child the best possible chance in life.

We will press for schools to be properly funded and accountable to parents and local authorities.

Adrian Ramsay campaigns to save local health care services

Fair pensions and free social care for older people.

We will fight for a decent basic pension for all - and free care and support for older people. 
  
Giving students a fair deal. 

Greens in Parliament will fight for higher education available to all, not just those who can afford it. We'll oppose student fees and support grants, not loans.

Protecting human rights and stopping unjust, unnecessary wars.

We will demand a progressive foreign policy and the withdrawal of UK troops from Afghanistan. ""

true,w1ll1amz,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"I'm really interested in why you think it should be illegal. 

Driving high is indeed a problem, I do agree. Making weed legal would bring this to a higher spotlight, it would be on a level with drink driving. All police are equipped with alcohol test kits (to my knowledge) by making weed legal it would force police to upgrade their kits to carry tests for this as well. Carrying the same penalties as drink driving, ban. At the moment it's too easy for people to get away with.  

Metal health issues related to cannabis are extremely skeptical, there hasn't been enough testing done due to the substance being illegal to come to a conclusion. Taking drugs during your youth will obviously seriously effect your health. That's why alcohol has an age limit, just like weed would if it was legal...

Due to the probable departure of Coates i think it would be a risk to shift Skrtel as well. Yes we could probably get decent money for him, but that would leave us with just one 1st team centre back with any premiership experience in Agger. We are clearly looking to bring in a new centre back, but I don't think one would be enough if Skrtel and Coates leave. Kelly and Wisdom have no 1st team experience at centre back and whilst i think they will both end up in that position i think its too early in their careers to start relying on them in that position.

I think we will see the sale of Pacheco and Spearing, couple of million for Jay and maybe a couple of hundred thousand for Dani. Think we might cut our losses on Assaidi too, Downing maybe if a decent offer came in. Carroll is clearly gone. We should look to loan out Suso, Robinson, Flanagan, Ngoo, Coady and maybe a few other from the u21's.

They sent me a replacement MODEM, helped me change some settings on the router, and they changed my line speed at the exchange. So far so good.

After enough Tweets, they gave me an email contact and they might have even phoned me up to solve my problems.

The Aus system works on the fact that people whom are out of work don't deserve to be punished. Just because you are unemployed does not mean you do not have the right to a decent quality of life.

It's based on fairness.

I would have to write a book to cover everything I think is wrong with the UK Government lol. In a nutshell though, it's the trickle down economics. 

They have bred a society that looks down upon people on benefits and are furthering this public opinion by making even further cuts to the welfare system. You do not help a country get back on top by punishing those at the bottom.

Aus skipped right over the GFC because the PM gave out lump sums of money to people on benefits. This worked because the people whom got the money (3 payments of $900) went out and bought TVs, cars, tattoos, fridges, designer clothes, laptops, phones etc etc etc. Thus stimulating the economy, rather than tax cuts for the rich whom spend their money over seas.

I think that the UK Government should up the minimum wage, up benefits and tax the rich. The poor would go out and spend and stimulate the economy and the rich peoples tax would pay back into the system.

Also - The UK make it pay not to work. My first job here regularly paid me less then JSA. They need to fix that.

Do some development in your spare time, if you can get committing to some open source projects or write a bit of software that others use then that is *very* valuable.  Also networking within Edinburgh will get you far, go to techmeetup etc and talk to people who share your interests.  You'll be offered a good job in no time if you are good :)  And after that who gives a fuck which uni you went to.

I've a CS degree from UoE and know a few guys that did MScs at Napier (these were really smart guys) and they had nothing but praise for the courses.  I've heard things are much more hands on/practical at Napier than UoE for example which is not a bad thing imo.  I work as a SW engineer in Edinburgh at a Silicon valley HQd company and we'd sure as hell give you an interview if you were interested in what we do (and could demonstrate skill regardless of the source of your degree).

We almost made this mistake with Lucas (and i was guilty at the time as well) and need to let him grow into the team and gain more experience as a player.

You're taking someone like Bale, who has exceptional ability, and telling him that he can only go down the left, and through that you are limiting the potential of him and the team. 

The problem is that we took our main left winger, and put him down the middle with no dedicated LW replacement. With that in mind however, I think Siggy is doing a fine job down the left, although he lacks the pace of Bale (there aren't many who could). I think at the moment we would be mad to put Bale back to LW. If you do that, you are stopping him from being able to easily explore the gaps which open up in the opponents midfield and defence, as Bales speed, strength and skill on the ball is perfect to penetrate those defensive holes.

In the summer, we just need to strengthen the depth of the squad, with some good stand in's for LW and RW as well as a bloody striker!",0,1364231435,null,0,false,0,c925129,t3_1azdau,t1_c925129,t3_1azdau,null,1431698229,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

If he's going down the Ronaldo route, of starting to play more centrally, getting those shots off too, then that's where he should be. He is the best player we have, and thus, his talents are best served in the centre, where he can have more impact on the game.

What's true is that we don't have a striker who can head it in. Ade seems exhausted with life, and puts in minimal effort, whilst Jermain is small, and won't challenge for the ball. But we have also lacked width. 

There's another post claiming we should have Andros to add that extra pace down the left once more, and have Townsend, Bale, Lennon as our '3', if only to fill the large hole Gareth has left behind him, which a pacey player might better fill than Gylfi.

I think we've done better with him in the middle than with him out wide. Because he has freedom to roam. Where he'd leave a huge gap on the left otherwise. At the moment, he plays centrally, wide both sides, up with the striker on the line, and back where he can pick the ball up and distribute, which is great. As opposed to darting up and down the wing, which is what he'd do if on the left again.

During World War II, he continued to serve in the British forces, while two of his brothers-in-law, Prince Christopher of Hesse and Berthold, Margrave of Baden, fought on the opposing German side.[21] He was commissioned as a midshipman in January 1940. Philip spent four months on the battleship HMS Ramillies, protecting convoys of the Australian Expeditionary Force in the Indian Ocean, followed by shorter postings on HM Ships Kent, Shropshire and in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). After the invasion of Greece by Italy in October 1940, he was transferred from the Indian Ocean to the battleship HMS Valiant in the Mediterranean Fleet.[22] Among other engagements, he was involved in the Battle of Crete, and was mentioned in despatches for his service during the Battle of Cape Matapan, in which he controlled the battleship's searchlights.
Philip was also awarded the Greek War Cross of Valour.[20] Duties of lesser glory included stoking the boilers of the troop transport ship RMS Empress of Russia.[23] He was promoted to sub-lieutenant after a series of courses at Portsmouth in which he gained the top grade in four out of five sections of the qualifying examination.[24] In June 1942, he was appointed to the V and W class destroyer and flotilla leader, HMS Wallace, which was involved in convoy escort tasks on the east coast of Britain, as well as the allied invasion of Sicily.[25] Promotion to lieutenant followed on 16 July 1942. In October of the same year he became first lieutenant of HMS Wallace, at 21 years old one of the youngest first lieutenants in the Royal Navy. During the invasion of Sicily, in July 1943, as second in command of HMS Wallace, he saved his ship from a night bomber attack. He devised a plan to launch a raft with smoke floats that successfully distracted the bombers allowing the ship to slip away unnoticed.[25] In 1944, he moved on to the new destroyer, HMS Whelp, where he saw service with the British Pacific Fleet in the 27th Destroyer Flotilla.[26][27] He was present in Tokyo Bay when the instrument of Japanese surrender was signed. In January 1946, Philip returned to the United Kingdom on the Whelp, and was posted as an instructor at HMS Royal Arthur, the Petty Officers' School in Corsham, Wiltshire.[28]

A great example of this is the ""acquisition"" of land from Native Americans who had no concept of property; it didn't make any sense to them that you could ""own"" trees, animals or anything else. The same applies to slavery, where property was often cited as an economic right should be held above that of the right of freedom of all people. 

Property is a concept invented by men that is malleable to whatever conditions *we* as a collective deem it to be; i.e. laws that defend land owners over anyone else. It isn't states that have taken property from people, it is states that have invented the very concept and notion of property in order to justify their possession of a disproportionate amount of wealth.

Don't misunderstand me, I'm not saying the government should reach into bank accounts and take things, just that your notion that governments were invented to steal is a bit wrong. They were actually invented by people that had already stolen; e.g. monarchs and Lords.

&gt; it is affordable in the UK

Not sure if you are serious - it is very much not affordable, and the demographics of the country mean it is going to get much less affordable over time

&gt; Tax the rich, up the minium wage and benefits and then instead of rich people spending their tax cuts overseas, you get the poor people spending in the shops and stimulating the economy.

You should get a job at the treasury you have all the answers! Of course reality is much harder than that - you tax the very rich and they simply leave the country. To tax the moderately rich and you don't really generate enough money to pay for what you've described. Tax the middle classes and suddenly you've got enough money but taken the wind out of the consumer economy. Hence why it's not so easy as every half wit on reddit would have you believe. I actually think the gov are doing reasonable in this area - increasing tax allowance to get as much low paid work out of tax as possible - the best way to put more money in poorer peoples pocket. 

&gt; It should be the Governments problem. If all the departments were correctly linked then they would be able to work together effectively and help find solutions to these problems. If people are scared for their life on public transport i'm sure many would rather stay home than go out to work.

I really not sure what you want from the government here. They just make a few phone calls and the crime in your area is sorted out? Clearly crime is a problem in any society, it's getting better in the UK but there is no magic wand that is going to make your journey to work easier. If you really can't cope with your local environs then I would suggest moving somewhere else where crime is less of a problem rather than looking to the job centre to sort it out. If you mean that you want some kind of work that takes account of your condition, well I don't have enough information to be able to comment on that.

Here it is anyway.

""It's true that the three of us, the Reverend Lewis Valentine, Mr DJ Williams and I, burnt the trees and buildings of the Bombing School in Penyberth. Us ourselves were the first to alert the police to the firem and we also let them know that it was us who were responsible.

But despite this, we maintain that this act was not a criminal, malevolent one; rather that it was an act that was our need and duty to complete, that it was an act completeted out of obedience to the call of conscience and to the moral code, and that it is England's government that is responsible for any loss caused by what we did.

The three of us ar men in privileged professions and hold respected positions, positions of trust, safe positions. I need to now speak about myself. I am a professor of Welsh Literature in the University of Wales in Swansea. That is my vocation. That is also the foundation of my pride and my greatest pleasure. Wales's literary tradition is one of the greatest literary traditions in Europe. Welsh literature is the only direct inheritance in these islands to the literary discipline of the classical countries, Greece and Rome. And it is a literature that is alive and growning, taking its nutrition and growth from a living oral language and from a social life that keeps its old traditions uninterrupted.

Realising this essential connection between literature and traditional social life in Wales is what first drew me from literary works alone to commit also to public work ac to found, with others, a National Welsh Party.

And the horrible conviction that the English government's bombing school in Llyn was fatally aimed at one of the essential hearths of Welsh culture, the most noble thing belonging to the Welsh nation: that's what made me deem my career, and even the safety of my family, things that I should sacrifice in order to prevent such a dire massacre.

Because it was not dead literature, not literature with its main interest to researchers of old things, that I teach in th university. No, I teach to young Welsh men the living literature of the Welsh nation. For that, this literature has rigjts on me as a man as well as as a teacher. And I am safe in the knowledge that what we did to the bombing school in Penyberth on the eighth of September saved the honour of the University of Wales, for besides Wales's language and literature, this university has no reason to exist.

A further note on my part in public life. I have been since ten years the chairman of the National Welsh Party. I was a member of the Broadcasting Advisory Committee that was founded by the University of Wales at the request of the British Broadcasting Corporation and chaired by the university's vice-chancellor, Bishop of Monmouth. We did a special study of the economic problems of the industrial recession in Wales and of ways of social re-organisation, and I was the beginner of the movement to found the Welsh National Industrial Development Council.

In South Wales I worked a lot with my unemployed countrymen in their clubs and organisations, and I founded Clwb Cinio Difiau[Thursday Dinner Club?], a club whose membership is on the rise through Wales. Through belonging to this club, each member who is living comfortably sacrifices his dinner one day each week, and sends the price of the dinner to pay for the Thursday Dinner of a man or woman who is out of work and short of food that day.

If you consider these things, and if you search the history and the propaganda of the Welsh National Party, you will see that all our actions and agendas are constructive and peaceful. We didn't ever want terrorism. We didn't commit terrorism. We never appealed to wild people. Indeed, the general complaint against us is that we're too educated and non-peasants.[better word def. exists!] I said time and time again in public speeches and in writing that it was peacefully and not through terrorism or violence that we would win political freedom for Wales. I say that again now. And I wish for you to understand that our action on the buildings of the bombing school in Penyberth prove these words.

If we wished to follow violent methods or methods of challenge and danger - the methods that small nations are often forced to follow because of the intolerable oppression on them - it would be easy for us, the leaders of the National Party, to ask some of the young eager and enthusiastic boys of the Party to light the bombing school and then to escape without anyone seeing or catching them. It would be easy, especially with the kind of night watchmen that were in Penyberth. But that would have been the start to a period of challenging and attacking. Mr Valentine and I decided that we would do everything we could to prevent such a development, and that others would be to blame if Wales were ever pushed to defend itself like that.

When every peaceful and lawful method trying to persuade the government to prevent the bombing school failed, when getting anyone to listen for even one second to our appeal failed, when we saw clearly that the entire Welsh civilization was under the danger of a lifetime, even at that hour we decided to appeal to the law and got twelve jurors from amongst our countrymen to give their opinion and sentence our action.

We ourselves, public men in Wales, middle-aged men and the leader of the Welsh National Party, set the buildings and trees on fire. It was us who informed the officers of the law of this. We gave the policemen every help to prepare the case against us. We are here before this judgement seat out of our own will. We are here not only for Wales, but also for peace and so that the dealings between Wales and the English government now and in the future will be peaceful, and will rest on foundations of law and righteousness.

We are accused of commiting an ""unlawful"" act. I intend to answer this accusation through an appeal to reason, and I will arrange this reasoning in four points.

It's possible, I guess. But they certainly hide it very, very well.

I just found the whole thing very odd given that pretty much the whole Bakersfield/Carlton Road area strikes me as being pretty average. There's the odd flashy house that might fetch half a million or so, but I'd be amazed if there's anything for a million and equally there's a few streets that clearly aren't massively affluent but again it's hardly squalid depravation in any of them.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I think De Bruyne is not ready to replace lampard. No matter the wages, we should keep lampard and de bruyne in rotation for a year. this year is totally gone, but we will need atleast 6months to get the youth transitioned to the main squad. 

if we are going to stick with current formation, we will need lampard, essien, mikel and debruyne to fill the two spots. that way, we will also be able to use ramires on wings, maximizing his potential. Hazard/Oscar/Mata/Marin/Ramires are not enough for the three spots, so we can easily get our youth players to fill in. 

Up top, lukaku, ba, and torres are all needed. We need enough players to go 2 striker formation after halftime, if needed. If we offload torres, we will have to rely completely on Ba and Lukaku. That will be one hell of a problem for any formation other than current one. Although, if we swap torres for cavani or falcao, we can easily allow one more year loan for lukaku. In that case, we can keep piazon for busy weeks. 

We should allow Bertrand to share role with Ashley, instead of playing him at wings. Bertrand is more suitable to replace Ashley, and desperately need first team action in that slot. Plus we need him to become Ashley's replacement over the years. Luiz should be moved to first choice sub for full back or cdm position.

Apart from this, we should really invest in a good defender to replace terry or give Chalobah a lot of chances. 

Currently our situation is so bad, that not only we are lacking in few positions, but we are about to lose our best players in others and still haven't got replacement ready. So, as much as I would love to, I don't see us challenging for the titles, next season. Keeping this year to get the squad ready for next half decade is much better. We have a youth squad full of world class players, so investing in them instead of buying new players should be our priorities.

If their earlier versions HAD seen the later versions of themselves then they could see and interact with themselves just fine. This is what happened in the 'Time and Space' minisodes.

There was one example of when they did create a paradox and directly changed one of their own past timelines. The episode 'The Girl Who Waited' and in it the Doctor has the TARDIS act as a paradox engine to sustain them both.

true,ratatooie,null,null,"Bannermans in the cowgate is good. Cheap and rock orientated. Bit scuzzy but nice nonetheless. It has a front and back bar (and another room for gigs). The back one is usually quieter. 

Lebowskies is good, bit a bit more expensive. It is just off Lothian road opposite the cinema on the corner. It specialises in white russians cocktails and has a whole menu devoted to them, so can be quite fun to try them out whilst getting a little giggly. 

A personal favourite mine is the Brauhaus which it just up the first road on the left off lothian road at the top. It specialises in all types of beer, and has something crazy like 300 different types. It is a small bar so get there early if you want a seat. One word of warning though, if there is a high likelihood of football being on the tvs and people watching if there is a significant game on. 

Jekyll and Hyde is quite nice and is on hannover street over george street. It is part of the eerie pubs franchise so is kind of victorian horror themed. It is fairly cheap and does interesting cocktails. It has loads of nooks and crannies for you to sit in. 

Also on hannover street (on the corner of george street) but further up is all bar one, which is good, but more expensive. It is civilised and loads of the young professionals go there. There used to be a good deal on whiskys but I am not sure if they still do that. 

Lastly, and possibly my go-to place is cloisters bar. It is average price, and old manny, but very nice and also a favourite with students. It is again up the top of lothian road on brougham street.

2nd to complain about the coverage at work. They've called me a number of times about it and are either going to discount my bill for the duration of the contract, or give me a Home Signal Box to fix the coverage issues. I get to decide, haven't made a decision yet.

The financial year runs from 6th April one year to the 5th April the following year. In any one year you can put £11280 into a stocks and shares ISA, or split it and put up to £5,640 into a cash ISA and the remainder into stocks and shares. However these figures go up to £11520 and £5,760 on 6th April this year.

So on April 6th you can head to your bank and put in this years allowance! :)

Check out your contract for your 12/13 ISA(s) though, because most likely there will be a clause stating that after the 1st year the interest rate will go down from something juicy (to get you hooked) to the base rate (not very much at all!) so you might want to find a new ISA provider and get your previous balances transferred over (although bear in mind the incubation period that your current contract probably has - it might be worthwhile to take the rubbish interest rate if you end up not getting paid any interest for 60 days!)",0,1364243824,null,0,false,0,c929khi,t3_1azrzy,t1_c929khi,t3_1azrzy,null,1431700435,11,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,11

true,voilavoila,null,null,"Lampard staying would be the best option - a three year contract and make him Captain.

Best case

(1) JM in - Rafa Out

(2) Lampard stays with a 3 year contract

(3) Torres for Falcao plus cash is a very realistic deal. 

(4) I would prefer Hulk than Falcao.

Torres loves Atletico - but he is only 29 and might not be ready to go back there at this stage in his career.  

Plus it is not necessarily a great deal, Falcoa is on fire at the moment but this does not mean he will slip into the CF role at Chelsea.

Our owner likes to spend the cash but he is also quite adamant in doing things his way.

On the grapevine, and this is the equivalent of bloke down the pub said - I have heard that Torres will be vacating his Surrey home this summer.  Not a valid source - just gossip in the town I live in - but it will be interesting to see where he goes.  I wish him all the best if he does leave because he has scored some wonderful goals and his play with Mata has been a joy to watch at times.

I personally feel Hulk would be a great move, he would fit in with Oscar, Ramires and Luiz.  I can't imagine he is enjoying his time in Russia with the Racism problems of the fans and the infighting amongst the club.

Add to this Colombians do not have a track record of doing well in the Premiership.  Not to mention Falcaos form has only been the past couple of years.  He had an absolute howler of a season a few years ago and the Premiership is not La Liga.  Not saying he is not very good, just that I feel Hulk would be the better option.

Not necessarily. People of a certain age and a certain class would inherit a share of two extra houses.

The housing market would crash immediately. So people would decide not to sell, but to rent them out instead. A large slab of what used to be owner occupied properties would now belong to private landlords. Rents probably wouldn't crash as badly (everybody needs to live somewhere).

true,Lord_Daft_Wager,,Furness,"I'm hopefully going to be graduating soon, and in my 3 years here I've found that the differences between colleges is pretty arbitrary. I'm in Furness, which I picked because it offered cheaper accommodation, which it delivered nicely (I think prices have gone up everywhere now though). I met some people who had lived in campus accommodation called 'town houses', which held about 12 people, but had big kitchens and sofas. I really missed having a sofa in my first year, so if you don't care about price, that might be something to consider.
Personally I've loved being in Furness; it's a small and tight-knit community, which doesn't take itself seriously on principle. Most students in Furness are aware that no-one's signed up because it has some sort of artificial 'reputation', such as Fylde or Lonsdale (although those colleges have their strong points as well). The result is a college with firm sense of justified pride in itself. The fact that it's bang in the centre of campus, with a newly refurbished pub, and bi-annual 15hr-bar-crawls are a big draw as well.

If you want peace an quiet, try Cartmel, if you want to pretend you live in a Skins episode try Lonsdale, if you like feeling depressed try Bowland, if for some reason you like the 'sports lad' type, try Fylde. The others are pretty much ok, but County stands out because of its bar/diner.
Either way, you'll find people with common interests, and the people you live with is always a lottery. Regardless of which college you end up in, make sure you join a whole bunch of societies, and try to immerse yourself in the fresher's week activities.

IF Lampard goes, that would leave us with Essien, Romeu (who wont play till probably November or December), Ramires, and Mikel. Personally, I think Strootman would be an amazing transfer and would slot in next to Mikel rather nicely. 

De Bruyne has played about 4 different positions this year for Bremen so I don't see him having too much of a problem, then again you never know, just my speculation. At Genk, he played more as CM then anything. Delivering pin point passes and doing good defensive work. Also, Oscar is amazing at keeping possession and out of those three (mazacar) he is much better defensively. I could see him playing next to Mikel as well which would allow us to have KdB---Mata---Hazard up front. Everything I have heard from KdB and seen points to him being ready. I think we should give him the chance and let him seize it. If I had to bench one to accommodate KdB it would probably be Moses, Mata and Hazard are just too fucking good.

1) State information. Or the lack of it rather. It is not immediately obvious to someone joining the channel or glancing at their IRC client on a 2nd screen how many people are added, who is added, who is a captain, how close it to full, or even wtf is going (team pick? people still signing in?). The best way to go about this is to utilise the channel topic and colouring to make things stand out.

2) Contrast. For example right now i'm looking at the channel on my laptop. I can see a whole sea of light green text that isn't easily accessible. Make things like ""x's turn to pick"" bold, Use a different colour for the 2 captain's when you're announcing things related to them.

3) Stats. Get them them out of the channel. Like half of my screen is just filled ""!stats"" and the subsequent bot replies. To put it simply, the bot is so god damn noisy you can't actually speak in the channel. Either PM's or a website would be the best way to go about it (or both!).

Lloris

Kaboul Dawson Vertonghen

Huddlestone

Walker/Lennon Sandro Dembele Bale

Two from Defoe/Ade/Siggy/Dempsey/Holtby

We have a strong central defense, this would allow us to play all three. Kaboul can play right-back and Jan can play left-back, so it would be relatively easy for Hudd or Sandro to drop back and form a back four mid-game, if necessary.

Huddlestone would play the Pirlo role (albeit not as well), he's not that fast, but he's a great passer, and having two midfielders in front of him would give him that extra bit of time.

Sandro and Dembele would have more license to get forward than they do now, both would play almost as box-to-box midfielders.

Walker would start against teams with great wingers (Chelsea) or great left-backs (Everton), whereas Lennon would play against teams we need more offense against (his defensive contributions this season have been impressive).

Bale might benefit from having more space in front of him as a wing-back rather than a winger (I realize he's been playing centrally).

Holtby is probably capable of playing in midfield, too, and Parker is there as backup too, of course.

It's a crazy idea, I know, but it'd be fun to see it tried (ideally in a friendly or something, not in an important game).",0,1364248644,null,0,false,0,c92bbfw,t3_1azdau,t1_c92bbfw,t1_c925ktx,null,1431701259,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4

3. You can provide education, certain drugs might only become available as part of a rehabilitation program.

true,mejogid,cnty-uk,London,"I'll address your question out of order, because you're sort of arguing backwards.

&gt; Here's a question, what provides a cushion that allows for bailouts and stimulus to be justified - a low debt or low deficit?

Both are necessary. Low debt allows for large one off spending and gives you longer until debt becomes a real problem. A low deficit (or surplus) means that decreased tax/increased spending (continued stimulus and welfare) will not escalate that debt too quickly, and means that fewer spending cuts and tax increases will need to be made to get the deficit under control. It's because of the deficit the Tories inherited that, as shown by the OP, debt will inevitably hit 75% despite the austerity measures.

&gt; But UK debt before the banking crisis was less than when Labour took government in 1997, due to them actually running a budget surplus from 1998 - 2001, which kind of negates the idea that they overspent in the long run. 

The debt was very slightly lower after ~10 years of boom. If you [look at a chart like this](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/budget/9932748/Budget-2013-Britains-debt-and-deficit.html), you'll see that debt was climbing through some of the most prosperous years in recent history. The deficit was at levels only seen before following the 90s recession, even though economic conditions were pretty damn good. Debt was already well on the rise, and would have ballooned even without the recession. Compare this to the 90s recession, prior to which the deficit was very low and the debt was decreasing: government finances were well prepared for the worst, whereas in 2008 everything was calculated based on best case scenarios.

Incidentally, that same graph demonstrates that New Labour was the only administration which saw the debt increase under prosperous economic conditions - previous administrations had been tasked with a 50 year process of paying off the war debt.

Anyway about the customer service, they bought my old and brilliant ISP Freedom2surf and failed to transfer the Direct Debit properly. Unfortunately I didn't notice, eventually they sent me a bill for over £400. Now if they admitted responsibility and spread the cost out for the remainder of my contract that would be fine but they were initially quite rude and acted as though it was my fault. Eventually they 'let' me pay in three installments but it was a right hassle getting them to agree.

Then their online account admin was atrocious, some of the worst usability I've ever seen. Eventually they redesigned their web admin but didn't migrate my account so I couldn't log in anymore and was unable to recover my password.

Finally they refused to give me a MAC code when I decided to leave and they also were unable to release the domain I had with them. Luckily I was able to pay Nominet £12 to seize my domain from them and BT seized the phone line.

'Small Government' is a typical conservative (US Republican, UK Conservative) approach to the size of an administration. Absolutely nothing to do with localism or representation.

In its simplest sense, it is how big the government is, and how many things it interferes in. 'Big Government' would include health, welfare, several nationalised industries (rail, gas, telephony, post, roads), and a bloated civil service. It would regulate and legislate to high hell everything it can. They tend to be awfully expensive to run and employ a lot of public sector workers. Think China.

true,Fearthedrog,present,,"Well said. I will say though, that Oscar playing in a deeper role scares me a bit only because he is so good up in that CAM position. But on the other hand Mata's strongest position is that CAM role too. I feel like either way one of them is going to be playing a little out of position. Hazard played more of a cam/ram position for Lille so he isn't really a natural winger himself. Lille only started playing him a little at wing halfway through last year and even then he switched between a full on winger and a right side oriented attacking midfielder. Moses really is the only natural winger we have. (Who is this Malouda people have spoke of?) and KDB seems to be adapting great on the wing. So that leaves the same question...who do you bench or play out of position? With KDB and piazon we have 6 attacking players on the books that aren't strikers. We either have to get rid of someone (again, who?) or bench someone (who?) or play someone out of position (who?). I love the addition of KDB hazard and Oscar but part of me wishes we got a CM of the same quality or striker of the same quality. But I don't want to make it seem like I think KDB isn't ready, in my opinion both him AND lukaku could play first team football for us next season. As our roster stands now, I think we need lukaku more than we need KDB. Just don't be surprised if our new manager, ESPECIALLY if that new manager is the special one, that they both are loaned out just one more year.

[Here's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys#Uniform_history) the history of the Dallas Cowboy's jerseys, which according to Wikipedia have undergone only 6 changes in the last 40 years. 

You'll see more change in the away/alternate jerseys, but in many sports the primary home jerseys remain very similar for years with only minor alterations.

In Football, jerseys tend to have minimal changes over the years. The big name teams that have been around forever (Packers, Cowboys, Steelers, Colts, ect) have uniforms that are virtually unchanged from the early days. College football can be similar (teams like [Penn State](http://cdn2.therisinghollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/tonyhuntjerz1.jpg), [Alabama](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/SEC-Uniform-Alabama.png), [Notre Dame](http://www.workplaceprivacyreport.com/uploads/image/MT.jpg) are known for jerseys that remain virtually unchanged), but many teams (lead by Oregon) are using wild and crazy uniforms for recruiting advantages. 

NBA is a little more frequent in changes, but still changes remain minor for the most part. The [LA Lakers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos_and_uniforms_of_the_Los_Angeles_Lakers) appear to make minor changes about once every 5 years or so since 1960.

We need to take care of everyone, but things like voucher systems and co-funded insurance schemes seem a much better option.

The original Doctor never used a sonic screwdriver, the first sonic screwdriver was something that came about during Two's time and looked like an ordinary pen light. And the first on-camera use of it was actually to unscrew a screw. The 3rd Doctor had a total of 2-3 screwdrivers through his run on the show. I say 2-3 because one was never referred to as a sonic screwdriver, he referred to is as his ""door handle"", but it functioned exactly like the sonic we know and love and looked similar as well. He later did use one he referred to as his sonic screwdriver (canonically, it's the Mark II sonic screwdriver, Two's being the Mark I*). He later refitted it with a different head for improved functionality, making it the Mark III.

The 4th Doctor used the same sonic screwdriver 3 had, the Mark III, and used it through his entire run. The 5th Doctor used the Mark III briefly as well, before it was destroyed. He never got a new one. Neither did the 6th Doctor. The 7th Doctor only got one towards the very end of his run and the 8th Doctor also used that one (Mark IV).

The Mark V is never seen in the TV series, only talked about in the continuing audio adventures of the 8th Doctor. 

The Mark VI is the one used by both 9 and 10. Technically, the 8th Doctor also used it in the audio adventures. 10 created a very similar one after it was destroyed, this would be Mark VII, which went on to be with 11 briefly. When it stopped working, the TARDIS gave 11 the Mark VIII, which is the one currently in use.

4) You can manually input awards with UCAS. If its not there, just write it in. That's what I did. If its an important award, you might also wanna explain it in the PS.

5) I would recommend applying through UCAS. You can apply to 4 other schools for free and in many cases without having to do any more work in most cases. I found UCAS quite easy to navigate, what are you having problems with exactly?

6) Read some sample personal statements.

true,RobertTheSpruce,null,null,"Rant incoming:

This year, fire has taken a big, correction, a huge hit.

Fire service budgets are actually given from two pots. One is a government grant, this is a huge lump sum. It's calculated in a hugely overcomplicated way, that you need to be rain man to understand. The other pot, icomes from, as most people realise, council tax. The numbers vary, some countires have a 50/50 split, some have 55/45 in facour of the grant, some get more from council tax, it's all down to what the local authorities want.

This year, the government grant has decreased. It's something that was to be expected. This government promised to make cuts, of course something has to suffer, it may as well be the services that the majority of the population never use, right?

But this has an impact. Fire services are government agencies, meaning that they cannot run a profit. They are not able to save up money. They cannot stockpile money for a rainy day, like a business or a person. This means that any cut means something has to go, or they need to get the money elsewhere.

Naturally, the fire services go to the local councils and say ""Hey! You know how we save lives and shit? We want to keep doing that to the same high standard as we have been doing for the last few years, but the thing is, thanks to Dave, we are now a £4,600,000 short. Any chance of putting the coucil tax in this county up 1%, costing the public a mere few pounds per year, but making a massive difference to us?""

""No."" Was the simple answer. You see, local authorities are elected officials. They would rather see people suffer, than put up costs a few pounds, because that would see them lose support. That's all it comes down to, they do not want to be voted out. They can have HUGE billboards and send out glossy leaflets telling us how they have not raised taxes, but at what cost?

What cost indeed. £4,600,000 may seem like nothing in a grand national scheme. Though, to some it may seem like a figure hard to comprehend. What will that fee pay for in this day and age? 4,600,000 tubes of Poundland imitation Pringles?

Also, the cost of running 3 full time fire stations for a year.

So in order to save that money, that's whats got to go. What does it mean to you, the taxpayer? Probably nothing. The majority of people never use the fire service anyway. You just assume it's there when you need it, and that will not change. Laws regarding responsiblility and protection are still there, so the fire service will still be there. Fire stations do not belong to towns, they belong to counties. All it will mean to you, the cash cow of the country is that is you need a fire engine, you will have to wait 12 minutes, rather than 8. 

Some will say it's not a worry, some will think it is. I, as a firefighter who may possibly lose his job, think it sucks. 

Oh and if you are interested about wage, £13 per hour following a 1% increase at the start of last year, which will now be frozen for the forseeable future, with a retirement age of 60, which is 5 years above the medically suggested age.



However, alternatives are suggested. You may see in the near future fire engines, with sponsorship on the side. Firefighters may look like formula 1 drivers, covered head to toe in logos and phone numbers. Insurance companies, energy drinks, and estate agents love this idea. Private fire services that only serve insured properties is a possibility in the future, or perhaps leave a bill after they have saved your house or children, should you elect not to insure your home and lives.

Is that the future you want? It may happen, if voters let it.",0,1364260377,null,0,1364260799,0,c92fde9,t3_1azoz5,t1_c92fde9,t1_c92bjtb,null,1431703241,22,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,22

Despite the fact that the capital share of GDP has been rising in comparison to wages the actual percentage return on investment has been dropping for a while (indeed it is likely that this is WHY the capital share of GDP has been rising and the wages share declining, a desperate attempt to keep investment returns reasonable).

Public industry and infrastructure provides a massive opportunity for investment though, previously not subject to a profit motive it can be reworked to this means of operation and thus temporarily increase the rate of return on investment in the economy.

Due to low rates of return there is a generalised lack of investment and this is one of the major economic problems of our time. Privatising things won't actually fix it, it's really only a temporary pushback, but this issue in general can go some way to explaining where the strong push to privatise almost everything under the sun (not even just fluffy things like health and social security but even those stalwarts of state action the police and armed forces).

I think it depends on your visa type. Do not expect to be granted a sponsored work visa unless you have a highly needed skill or trade based on information by the UKBA. To get a fiancee or spousal visa for the UK, you have to prove you have been in a relationship for, I think, at least three years. That includes photos, etc., not just an internet relationship. Not trying to be a downer, just sharing realistic information.
As for Liverpool itself, I absolutely loved it and would move back tomorrow if I could.

I had marathoned all six seasons of New Who in a few months so it had been a big part of my life. However I came out of it once I realized that you could rewatch Doctor Who and it's still AMAZING. I have gone back and rewatched most of the episodes, sometimes even watching episodes like Amy's Choice, A Good man Goes to War, or The Big Bang 6-8 times each. I have gained a greater appreciation for this show, and I love it more then ever. I recently discovered a Doctor Who Podcast called the DWP and I'm completely enthralled with it. I have gone back and listened to their analysis episodes for many of my favorite shows and I can't get enough of it!

TL;DR We have a better chance than other clubs, but I'm still not 100% convinced yet. 

There are four realistic options here: United, PSG, Chelsea and City. There aren't any other suitors that could afford him or attract him. I don't believe for a second he will go back to Inter nor do they want him back. One thing for sure is that he is definitely leaving Madrid this season. 

Red nose doesn't look like he is leaving United anytime soon and tbh I still stand by the argument that United wouldn't want Mourinho and would rather get a Moyes like manager. 

There haven't been any significant links to City or any indication that Mancini is leaving, so I kind of think this is a dead issue. 

Carlo is doing a good job at PSG and doesn't look to be leaving either. Jose said he wants to go to England and I believe him. Not to mention PSG is probably going to fall foul of FFP and not compete in CL. Mourinho wont go to a club without Champions league. 

Now from what I know Jose has been in contact with a lot of people at Chelsea, worked things out with Roman and has openly admitted to loving our club. Its in his style to come back and become a powerhouse in England again. Im sure spiting the FSW would be another reason for him to come back. So it would SEEM likely that he is coming to us. 

There are only two concerns for me. One, if we finish top 4. He wont come if we dont. Secondly, it all depends on how much control Roman gives him. Mourinho wont want the same garbage he had to go through before and will want full control. That means Emenalo and some other cronies of Roman needs to go. Not to mention Roman needs to stay out of things. This obviously would be ideal, but in reality its uncertain.

Falcao is not just some player of the moment he has succeeded in every team he has played for. River Plate, Porto and Atletico Madrid are all big clubs. Premier League is not La Liga? Yes I guess you are right but that didn't make it any more difficult for strikers like Aguero and Torres when they first came in. Hulk is a very good player but he is not in Falcao's level. When they played together Falcao usually overshadowed him. I understand why a lot of people on here are suspicious of spending so much money on one striker.

American occupation really only happened because of the war, so the only reason we're a state is because we're placed strategically in the center of the pacific.

For reference, you could say that Hawaii is similar to Scotland in the sense that we want to shake off our foreign rulers. (Not sure if it's still like that over there or what the populous thinks.)

As for constructive criticism (for next time! because she should keep painting!) I have a few things to mention that haven't already been said:  
  
First of all, the lightning looks thrown in.  It seems almost like it was an afterthought.  Also, lightning isn't curvy.  Her lightning looks more like tendrils than electricity.  
  
Second of all, she needs to rely less on colors from the bottle.  For example, her background relies very heavily on black paint.  Even if she still wanted it to be as dark as black, layers of swirling blues and purples will give her future paintings a lot more depth and allow her to create a much more realistic illusion of space.  
  
A really easy way to see the difference made by using a wide variety of colors can be seen in the difference between [this](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YRxr-M_O79Q/TsWWszuvjmI/AAAAAAAAAUw/V_5Ctm4fULk/s1600/dr-who-tardis-vincent.jpg) painting and [this](http://www.nortonsimon.org/assets/Uploads/Van-Gogh-Self-Portrait.jpg) one.

Then look at the second one, and see how the things that are actually blue are really five shades of blue, and white, and green, and reflections of the orange....

true,lommym,num11,,"Okay, I have several ideas... 

[First, 5-3-2](http://i.imgur.com/qIOcJny.jpg).  Using only the players that have been playing recently (I'm not sure who is still out from injury)... but lets assume no Lennon, Daws, Sandro, Kaboul, etc.  

Vert, Caulker, and Billy G are the steely back line.  BAE and Killa Kyle are gonna provide the width we so desperately need... this is a big ask, but Kyle definitely has the pace and sometimes  BAE seems like our only playmaker (sometimes).  Dembele and Parker are gonna play holding a little more, alternating between who goes forward to assist the more forward Little Tommy Carroll.  I loved this dude in the Europa League last year; I see flashes of Modric in his play style.  Him playing 90 minutes could be really difficult, but I'm getting paid the big bucks to make these choices so trust me.  Gylfi 'Gandalf' Sig will play behind Bale, helping the fullbacks link up with the midfield and forward.. a keystone (archstone), a bridge, the Icelander.  Bale will be the striker.  What other strikers do we have at the moment? 

Obviously we have other strikers at the moment, but they are kinda hella outta form and for a game this tactical masterpiece will impress even the most Roberto Martinez' of our world.  Defoe or Ade can come on later, depending on what kind of complaining the fans want to do.  

I think the biggest problem with the team is the lack of width we get when Lennon is gone.  Honestly, all the articles about Bale not having a good game being the problem completely disregard Lennon's absence.  He has been POTY for me... Bale's more recent conquest I think loosens Aaron's hold on it... but his play under AVB has been spectacular.  I'll post more ideas as the formulate.  Probably start a blog or something (joke).

The formation: 4231, the year: 2013, the goal: not cocking it up.    

The key thing in this formation is that we have a wide right player (in Lennon's absence).  Walker plays further forward with Naughton behind (I think that the more forward of the two is mostly arbitrary, they would ideally act as a fullback and a defensive winger, and thus could swap readily).  The dashed white line indicates that the players linked can switch back and forth depending on situations.  Bale and Gylfi will also have this option.  Bale moves out wide to start to help spread the field and hopefully drop some balls on Ade's head.  Long balls, however, are not the point of this line up... I'd like someone to play wide right so that Dembele doesn't have to... I think the team benefits from his skill set when he plays centrally.  Unlocking his potential would be key, I think, when missing other important aspects of the team (Lennon, our strikers' good form, Bale's wunderstrikes, etc).

If it was an abandoned crumbling structure in disrepair and you did so, perhaps making it habitable again by reglazing, rewiring, replumibing, and rebuilding it, it strikes me that you'd have a vastly superior moral claim than the absentee ""capitalist"" owner who had never even visited it, perhaps never even visited the country, relying instead on a piece of government paper indicating his families' murder of its previous occupants had been legitimised and would be enforced against all-comers with State violence; an owner who was simply sitting on it as an appreciating asset (despite its depreciating condition and in spite of families dying on the streets from exposure in that same town) and had no intention of ever using it or improving it and who was merely waiting for the pressure on land to push the value of his investment to suitable heights whilst hedging against a weak stock market in his nation of residence.

If my example is ridiculously extreme and contrived, then you need to appreciate that yours is too.  All systems of property can be made to look silly under the right (wrong) circumstances, and many different ones arranged along radically different lines can be made to work perfectly well thank you very much, given sufficient time, elaboration and the requisite community support.

You can create strawman scenarios of squatters or tenants taking your property under a mutualist system of property, and I can talk about a tenant can massively improving a property under capitalism and losing everything at her landlord's whim (ask Scotland's tenant farmers how abused they feel sometimes!)  People will clearly arrange their affairs differently under different systems of property rights, and you need to account for this when considering how they might work in practice.

As for the witterings on supermarkets versus self-sufficiency and buying versus owning(?!), I'm not even sure I know what you're on about matey. I'm not sure even _you_ know on that second one!  But, for the record, although I'm not a primitivist, I do think life is generally better when we have a more of a direct relationship with the earth and our food, and I think that this is pretty clearly borne out both intuitively and empirically.  If that makes me a hippy, sobeit, I'm a hippy (with better fashion sense and musical taste).  But I'm also aware that the planet's population burden means radical changes to mechanisms of food production without very careful consideration would be disastrous, both nationally and globally.  Having said that, there's masses of room for exploration of alternative systems, some of which are ongoing, and many of which are producing extremely promising data (which agribusiness, the supermarkets distribution system, Sloanist production model advocates etc. are none too keen on).  There are other projects like open source machines and technology blueprints for promoting alternative economies in the developing world not dependant on global capitalism.",0,1364279291,null,0,1364284119,0,c92l0bv,t3_1ayt1c,t1_c92l0bv,t1_c92jyfi,null,1431705923,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I don't, I classified my position not myself, a subtle but important distinction.  In all honesty, when I'm talking with non-anarchists in the real world, I tend to avoid the ""A"" word as it has a tendency to send people off in all the wrong mental directions, so I mostly let them see how I am and what I do, and take it from there.  Most people are in many ways closet anarchists.

&gt;Are you a religious man? I have no issue with you looking at the world however you want, or religious people doing it - as long as you're not harming anybody, it's all good.

&gt;However mate, it seems as though this political ideology of yours has gone through a lot of thought, contemplation and decision making. Far more than the average person anyway.

&gt;But what I think that has resulted in, is a belief system you defend and abide by - almost as if its a religion into which you were indoctrinated into.

&gt;Do you think your ideologies hinder free thought at all? Genuinely interested, you're an interesting guy. 

Nope, not religious, though not a fervent atheist either, I just generally avoid imponderables.  Although I can see where you're going with this comment, I think you misjudge anarchism as a sclerotic total belief system like Marxist Leninism or Fascism, but it's not like that at all.  It's a highly practical and pragmatic philosophy, mostly grounded in actually doing stuff (which is why it tends not to translate so well when it's expressed as a bunch of rambling posts on online forums) - making the change in the world you want to see happen, rather than relying on others to make it for you.

Would five people sharing the connection still be able to read their emails in a fraction of a second each?

Nope!

So, my point stands, that reliability and latency are more important now than pure speed alone. We've reached a point where downloading content can now be faster than we can consume it, so the network is becoming more bursty with high levels of demand for a very short timeframe, then long periods of idleness as the content just downloaded in a hurry is consumed at leisure.

If you're interested, you could try and [learn some of the Welsh language](http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/learning/learnwelsh/). I live in a Welsh county that is known for its English influence so sadly I never really had the language forced upon me and it's only a few communities in North and Mid Wales where you'll find some fluent speakers.

Also, if you hear the old ""we hate the English"" joke, this is more common, again, in North Wales and you don't find much genuine Anglophobia in the country.

Here are some basic Welsh words for you to mess around with -

Helo - Hello (pronounced the same).

Dave ydw i - My name is Dave (pronounced Dave uh-doo-ee).

Sut wyt ti - How are you? (Sit oy tee).

Dude, I've gotta go to work now, anyway. Speak to ya later.

Does substantial inequality benefit anyone in the long run - I would suggest that at the lower end people spend a higher percentage of their available income on the basics and it's that percentage of income being spent on the cost of living that's damaging. Inequality when everyone can cover more than the cost of living isn't great but isn't so bad. Likewise, I'd say forced equality, aside from being largely unworkable doesn't benefit people in the long run as our economy isn't geared up to cope (i.e. no-one would be able to afford to go on holidays to the lake district or buy holiday homes in cornwall).",0,1364285806,null,0,false,0,c92ly0k,t3_1azoz5,t1_c92ly0k,t1_c92dsg8,null,1431706337,-5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-5

The proportion of foreign nationals in prison is falling, also.  It's notable reading the governmental reports on prison population figures that they don't seem to share the same concerns as you; one of their main conclusions is that: 

&gt;There is a growing consensus that we are sending some people to prison who should not be there. Short prison sentences are not appropriate for all the offenders who currently receive them; and too many people with severe mental illness are in prison rather than secure treatment facilities. All of this contributes to the problem of overcrowding, which in turn limits the capacity of prisons, probation and other services to work effectively to reduce re-offending.

Ultimately I have yet to meet anyone in healthcare who think this is a good idea. The opposition to the bill at the time was immense, with almost all medical associations opposing it and the remainder sitting on the fence. It even managed to get NHS Managers and Doctors in agreement! Even the Royal College of GPs, who according to the spin will have control of the money, opposed it.

The result will be private (on the whole US Health Insurers) company cherrypicking off the profitable work, employing any 'suitably trained' health care 'professional' to do it as cheap as possible, and in bulk to save costs. If you want your cataract done, there will be no wait, but you will have the cheapest implant and the cheapest surgeon. If you have glaucoma (a common lifelong chronic condition) then you will unlikely ever see a doctor, and have your care delivered by protocols, nurses and opticians. 

If you have anything even slightly rare or difficult to treat, you will be SOL. Your care will be too expensive and difficult for the private companies to be interested in you and all the proper hospitals will be out of business as the bread and butter work has been done by the private sector.

true,mejogid,cnty-uk,London,"Well obviously you can't split people in two, but it's quite easy to redistribute wealth towards the median (tax the guy on £100k more and the guy on £30k less).

And it would be ethically dubious to take money from the wealthy if everybody started off on an equal footing and was remunerated in proportion to their overall efforts. In reality, inequality persists and amplifies through education, parenting, connections and much more -  you need to do something to level that playing field or you get a diverging society which is bad for a huge number of reasons.

Finally, pay is quite arbitrary since it's based on value of service (rather than effort, sacrifice or achievement) in quite an artificial market -  there's no way that the CEO on £2m works as hard as, say, 30 teachers, and it's very unlikely they contribute more to society. In that sense I don't really see anything wrong with wealth redistribution since the idea that people absolutely deserve their relative salary is a pretty sketchy one. For example, I think we'd have a much better society if teaching was an extremely competitive and desirable job. 

Edit: and returning to your above post, if society was more equal than the lake district wouldn't have to be dependent on the wealthy seasonally popping over and splashing out on some nice food. Seasonal un(der)employment is extremely undesirable. And to address some of your other examples -  the wealthy spending more on holidaying abroad or exotic cards is *not* an efficient economic stimulus.

&gt; ""No."" Was the simple answer.

That's my point. My county council has said ""Yes"" every single year, with many years the percentage being above 2.5%. They are the *only* increase this year. Local authority and police have both frozen their percentage this year, but the firefighters have still put on a 1.9%. While it's their lowest rise yet, it's still *another* rise.

My local town council has only increased their percentage 3 times in the past 10 years, and all have been small increases. The police have been consistent around a 2% almost every year, but for some unknown reason even they opted for a freeze this year.

&gt; Private fire services that only serve insured properties is a possibility in the future, or perhaps leave a bill after they have saved your house or children, should you elect not to insure your home and lives.

First part, this is pure political scare tactics. It will never happen. It's been done before and led to both racketeering and people not bothering to pay because their neighbours had paid. It would also be open to massive errors in lines of communication and lawsuits because they let a building burn for longer than the customer liked.

true,DimReaper,null,null,"I don't think there's a right or wrong answer to the cut spending to reduce deficit/borrow and spend more to stimulate growth argument, either could work in theory. Personally I lean towards the cut the deficit argument at the moment, largely because the Eurozone economies are still in recession too for the most part and probably couldn't generate sufficient demand for a sudden growth in UK exports. If we suddenly got better at selling things to the BRIC countries though, that could change things. 

Relying on domestic demand created by internal government spending to pay for debt fuelled production is like taking money out on your credit card to stick in your ISA and feel like you have a lot of money. It could work if you got a higher rate of interest on the ISA than you paid on the card, as you could bank the difference after repaying the debt. The argument for debt fuelled growth is that interest rates on borrowing are so low at the moment that the return on investment would outweigh the cost of borrowing, and that may well be true. But it doesn't change the fact that we can barely cover the cost of borrowing now, and when interest rates start to rise again (which is a 'when', not an 'if') we will be utterly overwhelmed in very short order. If a person/business/party/government believes that we can fuel domestic demand with borrowing and get growth up faster than interest rates will start to rise, then it's a good idea to borrow and invest as you can use the return to pay the interest on borrowing and still have some left to keep. If you think that interest rates will always run a little ahead of growth so any structural growth will be more than outweighed out by rising interest payments, it's a good idea to reduce the overall debt burden first, accepting that growth will be slower to come but more sustainable.",0,1364294116,null,0,false,0,c92mtgp,t3_1azoz5,t1_c92mtgp,t1_c929ujj,null,1431706814,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

[The Economist] praises Denmark, Sweden, Finland, and Norway for accomplishments often touted by social democrats—low poverty rates, egalitarian distribution, and efficient public services. But the magazine argues that these are now “centrist” societies because they balance their budgets, allow for consumer “choice” within their public services, and nurture risk-taking entrepreneurs. The Economist sheepishly admits that these countries funnel over 50 percent of their GDP through the public sector (versus a meager 30 percent in the United States and 36 percent in Great Britain). But Adrian Woolridge’s “special report” places inordinate emphasis on how the Nordic nations’ have trimmed their (still) generous paid leave, sick day, and disability benefits, while touting Sweden’s switch from a defined-benefit to defined-contribution public pension plan.


The Economist never once mentions that the Nordic economic model of growth-with-equity derives from the continued existence of a powerful labor movement (union density is above 70 percent in each country, versus 11.3 percent in the United States and 17 percent in Great Britain). Nor does it tell us that the historical dominance of social democracy means that Nordic conservative parties resemble Obama-style Democrats. Even as social democratic parties move in and out of government, the “Nordic model” draws heavily upon the egalitarian values of its labor movement and social democratic parties.

Last time I checked NBS had some 30 S&amp;S products on sale, ranging from very low to very high risk. 

&gt;What's the difference between using my S&amp;S ISA allowance compared to owning some stocks and shares?

In a word; tax. You can usually buy any S&amp;S ISA fund as a taxable investment. (this may not always be true with special ISA offers).

&gt;As I haven't done any trading before but would like to get into it.

You can get free advice from NBS, and all other banks. Speak to them. If you don't like their advice, ignore it and do what you want!

**To give a high level overview of some investment options:**

With a basic Stocks and Shares ISA you can buy into ""funds"", whereby your money is pooled with other investors and invested in cash, bonds and equities.

Each fund invests money in different areas. Some focus on government bonds, some on emerging market equities.

Each fund will have an annual management charge.

The value of investments often fluctuate in the short term. They can go up or down. This presents you with one of the risks of investment: if you need your money ""now"", you may lose out by withdrawing from the fund. Money you invest should be there for the long haul. (That means leave it there till it goes back up in value).

I've ignored housing benefit (£17bn) as the majority of claimants are working.

true,rhevian,null,null,"By investing in stocks&amp;shares inside an isa, you are protected against tax on capital gains and dividend income. In the short term this will not make much difference: outside an isa there is an allowance for capital gains, you only pay this tax if you gain more than around £10k in a year, and dividends in the first year may be relatively small - but if you keep investing into the isa over several years, you can build up a large portfolio that provides an income free of tax.

Think about whether you want to do short-term trading or long-term investing. I'm investing for the long term: I'm using my isa savings to supplement my sipp pension savings. I'm mainly investing in a diversified selection high-yielding shares that provide a good dividend income. This is loosely following the 'HYP' strategy as explained onthe Motley Fool website:  http://boards.fool.co.uk/faq-the-purpose-of-this-board-12648855.aspx

Savings in a SIPP (or other pension) gain tax relief when you contribute, and are taxed as income when you take the pension.  This is a good deal if you're in a higher tax bracket now than you will be once retired. With a ISA, you contribute from your income after tax, and there's no tax when you withdraw later.

Where do we draw the line between warfare and policing? Is there a line?

In the current 4231, there's a blatant lack of both depth and quality in the midfield band of 2 (aka the double pivot). In this formation with the style we use, these two players should both have excellent defensive qualities. They can differentiate in roles between a destroyer (someone who breaks up play with tackles and makes interceptions); and a distributor (who defends mostly through positioning to cut off passing lanes, and has the additional responsibility of moving the ball from defense to attack). This is the basic pairing that would work for Chelsea. 

At this time, only Mikel fits that scheme. He is an excellent destroyer, and though there are some better than him in the world, there aren't many. The other position in the pivot is where reinforcements are needed. Ramires comes the closest to offering what is needed, but ultimately he's not positionaly disciplined enough thus leading the defense vulnerable. This is due to the fact that Ramires is most effective transitioning from defense to offense not when he passes, but when he dribbles the ball up the field. So instead of moving the ball from a stationary position (passing), he moves out of position with the ball. He's not awful, but there is a problem. We need new CM's to play in that position, and to provide depth for when Mikel can't play (as we have no other destroyers). 

The reason I said that your question is conditional on the formation we play is that our midfield much better suits other formations, particularly the 433. If we changed formation we would STILL need cover at CM, but our problems would be less pronounced (at least in the starting 11). In this formation the 3 midfield archetypes needed are the destroyer, the box-to-box midfielder, and the attacking midfielder. Today, we could start a midfield of Mikel, Ramires, and Oscar. Not only would this midfield be balanced and skilled, but we also have cover in multiple positions (at least next season). We have many CAMS, players that can do a good job at BTB (maybe a little shallow), but we still definitely need someone to cover Mikel.

It quite quickly degrades into slums of high rise apartment buildings filled with people that are short on cash and short on options. To experience this you have to walk almost exactly one mile north of the city, or basically leave canary wharf.

I'm not saying London doesn't have great history, museums, food and culture but stepping outside the tourist trail is a direct and abrupt example of how wealth follows a power law distribution. It really isn't hard to see.

When I was interning in the city I had to look after a work experience kid (I looked after a few, but one in particular stood out as not being from a middle class area).  He explained to me how he had to check youtube every week to see which post codes were at war; basically, parts of the city that became no-go areas to him, not because of the colour of his skin but, rather, some arbitrary code assigned by post office workers years before the high rise he lived in was built. This was a far cry from the daily commuters or the working wealthy who lived in fancy loft apartments shared with their out-of town friends. 

Yet, to this kid's face, the people I worked with would openly espouse the virtues of deregulated free market capitalism; to me this, did, and probably always will seem like the most heartless world view you can imagine. Almost every worker in the rich areas of London is basically a tourist; they pay too much for their drinks, don't understand the culture or the history of the land they live in, can't speak the language of the natives and turns a blind eye to the problems around them because these problems 'aint theirs, they're just visiting.

Four years of experience that suggest that personally I'm not a real risk. Yet because I fall into a certain group I am penalised. It shouldn't work that way.

Having said that I would disagree that experience is even a real factor.

true,scoutisimba,cnty-uk,Cambridge,"It's almost like they're going out of their way to make it difficult for people work. And frankly it's not surprising so many young professionals are leaving the country either.

I am 22 with 4 years no claims. I don't have a job that absolutely necessitates night driving, however I would still be royally boned if there were to be a blanket curfew for the under 24s. I wouldn't be able to come in earlier than 9am or stay past 5:30 due to public transport. The bus service takes three times as long as my usual commute. In fact the bus is so slow that I'd be better off cycling, which is not something I like doing in the winter as I am not comfortable with dark and icy country roads. Given that I work in a job that requires working late to meet deadlines (software developer) I'd probably have to move into the city itself, or sleep at the office, or get a new job. 

And that's just work. My social life would be (even more) non-existent if I was unable to drive at night, especially during the winter months. That's not just shitty for me but for everywhere I spend my money. 

I doubt a night-curfew would change the premiums much anyway. Would there be significantly less accidents or would drivers just break curfew? Would people put off learning to to drive until they're older (new drivers are going to be low quality regardless of what age they learn)? 

Besides, the whole car insurance system is completely fucked. Full of unscrupulous cunts applying generalisations to individuals based on these sweeping demographics. By all means use experience (not the same as age) and driving qualifications but don't prejudge us based on something we arbitrarily share with millions of others. Maybe when the private sector takes over the police I'll be paying a special crime rate because I am young male of ethnic origin. 

P.S. I don't work in the north either. Imagine being banned from driving at night and living in Scotland. 

P.P.S. Zero-alcohol limit is dumb too. Can't guarantee that

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;My point was that these players are versatile enough to play in the pivot for the most part, regardless of it's their natural position such as luiz or de bruyne.

And my point was that we should probably get players who actually play there week in, week out, rather than shoehorning players in from other areas of the squad and deluding ourselves that we have sufficient depth there. We don't.

&gt;Your point on de bruyne being completely unproven in the premier league is interesting because how many central midfielders better than ramires are proven in the premier league? 

My point was that De Bruyne is an attacking midfielder. He hasn't played deep for Bremen so to say that he's definitely an option to play there in the Premier League is a bit silly, no? New position, new league. It's not exactly mad to harbour doubts, is it?

As for Ramires, a lot? Again, my point wasn't so much about being unproven in the Premier League (else we'd never buy anyone from abroad) more that the combination of new position and new league makes me discount Kevin as an option to play there. There are a lot of Premier League midfielders I would take over Ramires. It's not a popular opinion, I know, but it's my own.

&gt;Luiz and Ramires have proven they can play their effectively and oscar has been great in his limited time there. 

Luiz is a centre back. Ramires is often pretty poor back there. As I've said about a million times, if we're playing an open game where the opposition are attacking us I think he's great. His pace from deep on the counter is pretty unique in the game at the moment I think. However, if the opposition sit back (as happens more often than not) then he's next to useless. Oscar has played for how long there? Sorry, but he's Brazil's number 10. He should play there.

&gt;You also failed to mention that we have mceachran and chalobah who are typical pivot players coming up in the next two years as well

Josh McEachran who has looked *alright* in the Championship is not a viable option. Chalobah, who is 19 and has looked great in the Championship, should not be in our squad next year.

So I jumped ship and used MailBoxesEtc, which are perfect:

http://www.mbe.co.uk/

This, again, was cheap when I first got it, but is now the same kind of price (£204). I have stayed with them however, for a few reasons:

Staff are 1 billion percent nicer. Nobody in my local Royal Mail office actually had a smile on their face, ever. They all complained they wanted to go home. This is a personal thing, but it's nice to walk into the office and say ""hey, just here to collect my mail"" and have someone ask you how your day is going, rather than having someone just grunt at you and going back to his tea and biscuits.

MBE Staff were also a lot nicer and helpful when I had a packet missing. The courier said it was signed and delivered, MBE had no record, and offered to chase it up with the courier on my behalf, a day later I had my package. I've had this *many many* times with Royal Mail, and most often, they really couldn't give a shit and it was down to me to figure out what happened.

Location - MBE have 3 offices near me, all within distance of me going to and from work. My nearest Royal Mail PO box office is 13 miles away, and would have to be a long train or bus ride (and by the way, that bus was shite and therefore I would normally have to take two buses).

No problems if you get lots of shit delivered there. I went on holiday but had a few things delivered. I let them know and the guy there said that's fine. When I come back, Royal Mail kicked up a stink and the staff there threatened to cut my PO Box because I was abusing it. Have done the same thing with MBE who had no problem.

The mismanagement of the UKBA in the last year has been catastrophic. Truly a fucking shambles, largely thanks to May herself.

In the run up to the Olympics the UKBA completely shit the bed when it came to checking passports at Heathrow (so few staff there that apparently more had to be flown down from Manchester each day to cope) - too many staff had been cut and new, temporary staff were being loosed on the x ray machines with as little as two or three days training according to some reports.

And when the UKBA members thought about striking to raise concerns about these grave security errors, Mays response was to raise the idea of [sacking the motherfucking lot of them.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jul/22/olympics-strike-uk-border-agency)

This is fairly common in most other sports, but not in football, for some reason.  Dwight Howard of the NBA's Lakers, for instance, is carrying a shoulder injury at the moment and has missed only a handful of games to give it rest.  So I think the shoulder injury, at this point, is more a way to get Allen out of playing so he can get his mind right and start fresh next year.  I support that move.  I think that if Allen had had a great game against Soton, then he would've delayed surgery.

But this is all speculation.  I agree it'd be nice to see someone put that question to him and get an answer.  Henderson was the obvious choice.

Oh, they're only low *because* of Cameron's austerity? What rot.

There's no instance of any free floating currency-issuing government and all debt denominated in that currency *ever* having any difficulty at selling bonds for any more than a small markup over the central bank set interest rate - even when debt is &gt; 240% of GDP.

true,TheMania,null,null,"You don't want to balance the books.

We have a debt based monetary system - money is created when someone goes into debt. How do you accrue savings under such a system? By putting someone else into debt. How do households/businesses in aggregate accrue savings? By putting the government into debt. But that's ok - because unlike households, the British government is not limited in the amount of GBP denominated debt it can accrue.

It's all explained well [here](http://heteconomist.com/parable-of-a-monetary-economy/) - it's vital that in a recession, when people desire to save, that the government provides them with those savings by it itself running deficits. Attempting to run neutral or surplus budgets is attempting to limit the amount of savings households can accrue, which results in the [paradox of thrift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_thrift) leading to high levels of unemployment and low levels of consumption for all. People don't drop their desire to save just because the government isn't running deficits, they just start saving at the expense of others.

The only reason this recession has been so damaging to the British economy is because politicians and the people that vote them in like to think of the government budget as a household budget when it couldn't be more different. If we'd simply allowed automatic stabilisers to do their job instead of fighting them, trying to cut the deficit, there would have been no need for the poverty now facing so many.

Important to note: Euro using nations are currency-users, and *are* like households in that regard. Their budgets are tightly constrained by the monetary system they have chosen to use, the UK's is not.

In a debt based monetary system public sector debt = non-public sector savings.

That is, the UK government's debt = the UK household's plus foreign sectors savings in GBP. You don't want to ""pay it back"", as it'd mean confiscating/destroying those savings Cyprus style.

Same for the US - the massive US debt is owned by US households and foreign nations as USD reserves, their currency could not be a reserve currency without it. Same for Japan - the insanely huge Japanese debt is what allows Japanese households and pensions funds the money they all desire to have for pensions. If Japan attempted to limited it, they would have all ended up jobless long ago as the [paradox of thrift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_thrift) set in.

So basically, the more savings your people have - the more debt the government has. If you want low debt, you need to be happy with low savings.

true,thelardboy,eng-kent,Kentish,"Rent is currently more expensive than a mortgage thanks to interest rates running at an unprecedented low level; an emergency measure to stop the major economies of the world imploding.  For a person making the decision between renting and buying, it has historically been cheaper to rent than buy, as the rental market contains a large range of properties which are at different stages in their mortgages.  This means a landlord who has owned the property for 5 years, or who bought with only a 50% mortgage can rent it out cheaper than the mortgage of a new buyer and still make a profit.

Thousands of people losing their homes is exactly what happened in the 1970s and the 1990s.  We came out of both of those crashes in a strong enough state to have a sustained period of growth until the next downturn, where we have this time gone into what is looking like a lost decade.

A fall in house prices leads to more movement at the bottom of the ladder, which means more people buy stuff for their houses.  This is good for the economy.  Lower house prices also create more BTL opportunities which reduce rents.  Given that there is a focus on trying to minimise the costs of benefits, a reduction in overall rents would also reduce housing benefit costs, freeing up some govt money to be spent elsewhere.

We have to stop thinking that high house prices are good for anyone except land owners.",0,1364318602,null,0,false,0,c92sst6,t3_1azoz5,t1_c92sst6,t1_c92rb2o,null,1431709660,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I really don't want to bring up the ""I go to games I know more than you"" stuff because it's largely untrue.

true,SteveD88,cnty-england,Northamptonshire,"I was at an Engineering conference in Northampton last week, with Vince Cable in attendance to announce a new local investment scheme (and take questions).

When pressed on the banks he admitted that when he'd taken office he hadn't appreciated just how seriously normal relationship banking with businesses has deteriorated; he blamed this on a culture shift within banks from relationship-based banking towards insurance-product banking, driven by sales targets and commissions. 

He also repeated the issues with banks de-leveraging by reducing their lending levels, saying he was now essentially running two state-owned banks to support lending (in addition to the two nationalized banks).

Now I admit; I'm envious of my London friends. One works in banking IT, the other works as a pharma consultant. Both earn in the £80-90k region, as graduates in their early 30's. Sure they are more sucsessful then most, but then...it is extremely unlikely I will ever match that in my career, no matter how well I do. 

I know my site manager, a guy in his 50's with responsibility for a group turning over millions annually, only pulls in £60k. And this is the R&amp;D wing of a major aerospace company...

Engineering simply isn't a very highly paid career, unless you enter very specific parts of the civil engineering sector. We loose all our best maths graduates to the banking sector; a few Engineers I know have encouraged their university-age children to avoid engineering entirely.

We're told we need more industry, more people like me, but recent surveys of school-leavers reported in the BBC haven't even shown engineering on the scale of careers they are considering.

Because nobody can ever form their own opinion, independently of whom they work for, can they?  And no, I do not work in insurance or the car industry.  And neither do I have any sympathy for the experienced motorist.

You have very little history, so based on that, I'd charge you a fortune too.  Once you've demonstrated you're not a risk, then you can pay a bit less.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Yup, I'm from a state school and can confirm this. 

I had an Oxbridge interview recently and all of the other applicants were from private schools - which had been drilling them in interview technique for months apparently. Personal statements are also routinely doctored by several teachers as well, whereas at my college I got no help at all - as all the tutorials for UCAS applications occurred after the earlier Oxbridge application deadline. 

I did quite well in the entrance exam, but I absolutely bombed at interview as I had no idea how I was supposed to prepare ( I was the only Oxbridge applicant at my Sixth Form, so I couldn't get any help from teachers because they had no idea how the process worked). 

Also, from my experience with private school kids, they are imbued with more confidence by the system they go through - which is very important in interviews. From my point of view state education hurt my confidence. I fully support the 'no child left behind' approach in secondary school, yet it resulted in the disruptive kids getting the teacher's attention, meaning that the more academic kids couldn't really push themselves. There was also a culture of anti-intellectualism that was compounded by the lack of streaming. If you asked questions in class you were bullied as a swot, and many of my teachers would encouraged this by implicitly advising me to 'not be a smart-arse' and such like. 

Nevertheless Oxbridge are pretty keen to be egalitarian as they organise a lot of summer schools and things to ensure poor kids get a chance. However, while they don't institutionally discriminate by wealth, there is still an imbalance. If you are a genius from a poor background you'll get in fine. However, if it's a toss up between you and a private school kid in terms of intelligence(like it was for me), the contingent factors from their private schools will swing it ( e.g. confidence and interview practice). 

Also, while Oxbridge has to appear more meritocratic ( due to their position as the nation's 1st universities) the other Russell group universities (especially Durham) can get away with being less concerned with the contextual factors of a student's background, as they aren't so much in the public eye.

I know people who while they have passed their test, have never driven their car since they passed many years ago.

But it doesn't mean they'll be safer than me, it'll be just like how I was just after I passed my test.

As for ParrotofDoom he/she never seems to want to tackle the problem of so called ""experienced drivers"" flaunting the rules and laws of the road by speeding, being distracted or driving somewhat erratically (e.g. others having to slam on the brakes at a roundabout because they suddenly realise 30+mph is not a good approach speed - this happens quite often and as the ""unexperienced driver"" I am the one having to take measures to avoid a collision).

true,JayCartwright,lfcflame,,"As far as the Lucas question, I think you pretty much answered it for yourself but I'll add some detail.

 Lucas is an immensely different player from the players you mentioned in Alonso and Vidal. Lucas' role is one of a ""ball winner"" and then as I like to think of it, a ""recycler"". His first (and primary) job is to be the first person during an opponent's attack to get stuck in there and try and break up play. Lucas is always looking first to cause a turnover in possession, either through a challenge or a clever interception. He does both of these things very, very well. If he has been successful with his tackle or interception (which he way more often than not is) his next job is to get that ball moving upfield again with a quick, short pass to another mid ahead of him or someone out wide. Nothing fancy, just quickly get the ball recycled back to guys higher up the pitch to get the attack moving again. He also does this very well.

Lucas' role is not a glamorous one but one that is so necessary for a winning team and he does it so well. He isn't in the team to score a crucial goal when you're tied at one all in the 80+ or play that killer through ball to Suarez for him to finish, but chances are neither of those things could have happened without some Lucas involvement earlier in the move.

As far as a player I currently ""don't get"" I will go with Shelvey. I know he isn't even challenging for a spot right now (and is flavor of the moment for criticism from us) but even early in the season when he was in the team, I just didn't see what he brings to the table. I keep hearing how raw he is, and that if we give him time he will be ""The Next Steven Gerrard"" but what exactly does he do so well that we have been very high on him? As far as I can see, he isn't a great passer, his shooting has been dreadful, he isn't exceptionally quick and while he has the balls to step up and take a free kick when he was only 19, he would send 95% of them into row Z.",0,1364326301,null,0,false,0,c92vl31,t3_1b23yx,t1_c92vl31,t3_1b23yx,null,1431711022,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

true,BrokenClockwerk,lfc50,,"In the modern game, partially due to television dictating more aspects of it, and partially due to the success of the Cruyff-spawned ""total football"" of Ajax that has spread throughout the soccer-playing world, attacking is generally prioritized over defending. You can see this in transfers (with the exception of Thiago Silva to PSG, I can't think of another huge transfer of a center back in the last year or so, whereas every transfer window brings a slew of expensive forwards and attacking midfielders) and branding (to the devout fans of a club, we know everyone, but you say ""Liverpool"" to a non-fan and 9 times out of 10 they will think of Suarez or Gerrard). 

This brings two changes to the way the game is played on the wing. The traditional ""wide midfielder"" role has been phased out in favor of attacking fullbacks and wingers. Somewhat due to increased fitness, we can expect players that are generally attacking (wingers) or defending (fullbacks) to run the entire length of the pitch and occasionally overlap. We saw this best at Liverpool when Johnson was playing LB with Enrique at LW. The natural space between the two positions is filled in by whichever player is less advanced, and the fluidity allows for fast counter attacks. This counter attacking style has had a lot of success in the PL era and is why Lucas is so necessary.

Few teams play with 3 center backs. 3 center backs with a wing back on each side forms the most stable defense (you see that formation most in Italy, which is known for being a somewhat more defensive league). However, center backs are generally poor offensively, and lung-busting runs by a center back usually cause more problems than they solve (see Agger's runs. Occasionally, he sets something up, but often he leaves a hole for the opposing team to exploit). Because of this, most teams play with 2 center backs. 

Most teams also play with at least 3 attacking players (either a striker with two wingers, or two strikers and a central AM). This means, if there is a quick counter attack, the attacking team has a numerical advantage. Speed and stress have a factor, but it's generally easy enough to pass or dribble your way past two center backs if you have a numerical advantage.

If you're a center back (my natural outfield position, although I'm first and foremost a keeper), getting caught in one of those counter attacking positions is the absolute worst scenario. If you're outnumbered by players who are generally quicker or more skillful than you, your options are either to back up and try to give your midfield and fullbacks time to get back, or go for a tackle and stop the attack. If you move back too much, you've let them get in on goal. If you go for a tackle and miss, they've burned you and now it's 3 on 1. You can see this very well in high defensive lines, like Arsenal's and Tottenham's. Although there are benefits to a high line, the drawback is that if you get burned in the midfield, you can't recover.

This is where Lucas comes in. His sits in front of the center backs, which allows him first chance at stopping those counter-attacks. There is rarely much space between him and the attackers, so he doesn't have to make those decisions. He goes for a tackle. If he misses, there are still two center backs, and hopefully he's bought enough time for another CM or the full backs to drop deeper. Statistically though, Lucas is one of the best tacklers in the PL. He breaks up opposition attacks extremely well and, because he's more advanced than a center back, there are opportunities to turn his defense into an attack. Counter attacking from the first third is basically just long-balls, but a quick set of passes starting from the midfield can lead to a controlled, effective counter attack.

In short, Lucas's role is to offset the defensive weaknesses brought on by an attacking style, namely counter-attacks. Under Rodgers, he is also reasonably effective at setting up attacks himself, by acting as a link between the defense and the attack. He keeps the backline strong by covering when necessary and roaming the deep midfield, and uses his ability to tackle to stop attacks in the midfield, instead of allowing them to progress to the final third.",0,1364327511,null,0,false,0,c92w13q,t3_1b23yx,t1_c92w13q,t3_1b23yx,null,1431711244,39,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,39

The way I look at it, it is just a part of Lucas' overall personality and game. He is a bit rough around the edges some games and lacks a little ""polish"" but I think he more than makes up for that in his tireless work rate and spirit. He is the ultimate ""never give up"" story and that is just one of those intangibles some players will never have.

By his own admission, he isn't a ""proper Brazilian"" in the way Coutinho is (flair and a trickery), but it certainly seems that Brazil would benefit very much right now from Lucas' ""improperness"" in the way that Liverpool does week in and week out.
