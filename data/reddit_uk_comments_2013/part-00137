true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"The BBC has had its' license fee frozen for five years. They have to cut as many services as possible now that they've sacked 20% of the staff and half-emptied TVC so this one is an easy win for them - but I'm not sure that means it can be taken as a barometer - to do that, at least provide some evidence other than your assumption if it's based only on the Beebs' excuse. Have sales of 3D TV's or BR's dropped or something? Did you (for example) see the consultation the BBC did about halving the bandwidth for all the HD channels? (After the response page for it filled up with complaints, the BBC announced it 'a success' and went ahead anyway)

Out of the movies you've seen, surely you've seen better examples? I mean, we've seen some films (especially retrofits) where the 3D has barely added anything at all - but for every Alice in Wonderland there's a number of Tron Legacies. And even then, the retrofits have improved a lot since the beginning too - Avengers Assemble is a great example. To say they're 'all crap' is just silly. You need to watch stuff on a different screen.

For scenes like the laterns in Tangled or the chase scene in TinTin (did you really not see Haddock jumping out of the screen in a dress?), they are clearly a) designed for such (without resorting to breaking the 4th wall and nothing else), and b) make things stand out that you didn't notice in the 2D version. Avatar had loads of scenes like that. Jumping from missle-to-missle in Despicable Me is another good one.

Then there's gaming - suddenly having a 3D view of how far away someone is does wonders for your accuracy. Having a helicopter explode about you and the parts come showering down around you - stuff like that I really didn't expect. Playing Crysis 3 (with HUD) alone pretty much sells it...Skyrim also was about as good as it gets. And it works on any modern 3D TV, you don't need Nvidia glasses the TV ones will work (but they do take you for a one-time $28 to enable it in the drivers).

You talk as if 3D is actually going away any time soon - it's almost free to include the technology in a TV and the studios are going to continue pushing it, just like they did when 5.1 (and before that, Stereo VHS) was described as 'pointless' - people had to be sold on the virtue of DVD when it first came out; the same is happening now with HD. And that's before we consider that directors like Scorcese are making stuff *designed* for it.

This is a small subreddit and I think it's quite unnecessary to be rude when people always ask questions about the city here, most of which *can* be Googled but are sought for the experienced and up to date answers of people currently residing in Edinburgh.

I often contribute in this subreddit to help people, even when I know that  they can Google the best bars or restaurants in the city or look at couchsurfing if they're looking for a place to crash. I also try to give everyone a chance with whatever they submit to this subreddit, even if it may seem spammy and like it's marketing driven, something which many other members of this subreddit would feel deterred by and often downvote.

This brings me to yesterday when you posted a second advertising link to the startup you're working for. You got downvoted on your first post as well as the second, slightly defensive one. Instead of being rude to you or downvoting you for blatantly using this space to advertise something (whose function I initially found no more helpful than Yelp or TripAdvisor) I [downloaded](http://i.imgur.com/hTHQuff.jpg) it. After creating an account, getting familiar with it, and admiring the design and functionality, I spoke about it and recommended it to two of my friends who have an exceedingly successful digital startup here in Edinburgh and have quite an influence on the Edinburgh tech scene as well as the startup and investment side of things. I didn't have to do that. You're a stranger on the Internet, but I thought it was fair to give you a chance because this is a small community and I respect the people who post here.

true,intangible-tangerine,eng-Bristol,Brizzlefoshizzle,"The 'coup' (although I hesitate to use that term since they are claiming to be installing an interim civilian gov. rather than a military one) was preceded by protests involving millions of Egyptians who were angered that Morsi and the MB were still acting like an opposition party, focused on attacking their enemies and not on getting the Egyptian economy and public services functioning. The army's excessive use of force in some instances does not take away from the fact that the MB had totally mismanaged their effort to rule Egypt and that having lost the support of such large sections of the army, the police and the people they were in no position to mend that. 

If Egypt is to avoid a viscous circle of chaos the MB needs to work with secular and non-Islamic elements in civil society and they in turn need to work with the MB. There are currently some more moderate Islamic parties attempting to build these bridges. 

The MB won the election with a moderate platform, however their practices whilst in power have been far in excess of democratic norms and of their own election pledges. Democracy is not just winning an election, it is a whole package; equality before the law, fair representation, free speech and assembly, transparency etc.  They have simply not demonstrated that they have any interest in being a government for ALL Egyptians, respectful of the rights of those outside their base.  

Saying 'they won the election' so they should be allowed to govern unconditionally is very dangerous, the elections were held in very unusual circumstances, very shortly after the fall of Mubarak. Political parties had not been allowed to form and function for decades, the MB was the only alternative to the Mubarak regime that was familiar to people, but they are not a political party as we would understand in the U.K. they are at heart an Islamic-militant group. They have a political wing and moderate elements and roles in running social services and lots of admirable things about them. But until they transform in to a real political party from the top down, committed to democratic processes,  they should not be regarded as such. 

The Army are not disinterested brokers in this, they have very strong motives to make sure Egypt is run in a way that appeases the West. A lot of the Egyptian property and tourist market is controlled by the top Army brass and they depend economically on inward Western investment. Their motives may not be pure 

BUT 

Ordinary Egyptians also depend on Egypt having a functioning economy with inward investment, they need jobs and to be able to afford the cost of living, they need a government who will pay attention to the stock market. 

The Army may be morally impure, as much as the MB is, but pragmatically what Egypt needs right now is stability and a chance to build a true democracy and for that end this 'coup' was, I think, a necessary evil. If they can put a stop to belligerent rhetoric and start negotiations with the MB and their supporters and begin to loosen their grip on the economy to allow for more wealth distribution they have a chance of rescuing Egypt and allowing for a democratic government with enough popular support (or lack of vehement opposition) to function normally ",0,1373224691,null,0,1373225082,0,caxq320,t3_1ht96z,t1_caxq320,t3_1ht96z,null,1430553156,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

true,tachyons22,null,null,"Since you're young, that's actually not that bad. If I were you, I would do the following:

* Get really good grades in high school. Take *at least* 3 AP classes and try to get 4 or 5 in each AP test, when it comes time for your SAT score *at least* 800 in each section, and try to get your GPA as close to 4.0 as possible. Also, work your ass off to save up as much money as possible.

* Apply to UK universities in a STEM field. If your scores are very high, you'll have a good chance of getting in. It costs about $19,000/year for tuition, and the first year you have to show that you have $11,000 to cover living (or $14,000 if you study in London) for the visa.

* Get into a [Russell Group](http://www.russellgroup.ac.uk/home/) university, which is like their version of the Ivy League. Whilst there, get as much work experience as legally possible and aim for what they call a ""first,"" which is the highest scored degree that you can get, like a 3.8+ GPA would be in the states. At the end of your final university school year, send out your job applications to companies throughout the UK. 

* Receive a job offer that satisfies the requirements needed to get a [Tier 2 visa](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/visas-immigration/working/tier2/general/). Hopefully, your job will still be in shortage, if it isn't, then you probably won't get many responses to your job applications. If it is, you'll get a bit more.

* After working for 5 years you can apply for [indefinite leave to remain](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/visas-immigration/settlement/) under the SET-O category.

* After being here under that visa for another 5 years, you can apply to become a British citizen through naturalisation.

Point is, it does not matter what formation Chelsea plays, they still only have one CDM (and maybe essien/romeu). Unless you have a Pirlo, 2 box to box CMs and whatever CM does not change the fact that you are still missing a CDM. 

2)  I just don't see how you think KDB played as an RCM. He played wider than Chadli, who was in fact the RCM with Fellaini. This should have been obvious with his header and the amazing play by hazard ending up with the choke job by Benteke. And yes, positions change sometimes. But, that is football, someone makes a run, you have to cover. But their base position does not change.

A lot of the team Gerrard uses his right foot out of purpose, not preference. If Suso continues to develop as a right winger then favoring one foot won't turn out to be an issue. It just makes it harder to take on that attacking midfield/creative attacking role. 

Suso has some incredibly qualities playing from deep though. If his game is going to be one with less mobility and playing more down the field than in all directions, he will be okay. I only felt the need to bring it up because it's the reason he stopped being played as a striker and as an attacking midfielder and was moved to the right wing while in the academy.

March 1st, 2008:
&gt;  Belfast's best known street drinker and cultural icon, Mr Gerry Glennon, passed away today in hospital after an elongated period of ill health.

&gt; His funeral will be held in the coming week. 

---

&gt;  Vuk me.

&gt; He caused me to loose a crap job once, and for that alone I am eternally in his debt.

---

&gt; Sad news.

&gt; Was sitting in Botanic one evening in Pizza Temps having some grub when in comes Gerry and his mate. They were faffing about and the guy who owned the place told them to leave. Gerry refused but the guy was getting really angry. Gerry turns around, lunges at a cooler fridge grabbing a snickers, and starts to leg it out of the place when the guy catches up and grabs him at the door. Gerry spins around on the street having dropped his snickers and shouts 'I DIDN'T EVEN WANT THAT, I WAS TRYING FOR A MUFFIN!'

&gt; RIP Gerry.

---

&gt;  RIP In Peace Gerry. A true Belfast Institution.

&gt; I'll never forget that brief moment of terror one experienced when he appeared in ones line of vision

---

&gt; Gerry put me off eating in Subway - he was in the one behind Boots trying to get a ham sandwich and the Asian girl really didn't understand his particular brand of Belfast banter - she got there in the end - but as he moved along the glass fronted counter, various bodily fluids ran from his facial orifices, filtered through his encrusted ginger beard and smeared different coloured goo along the glass - put me right off sweet onion dressing......RIP

true,PeterSutcliffe,,Pint of Vodka pls,"Everything was good apart from this evening where it feels like god took a big steamy dump on me, not sure why though. I've got fairly good karma, shit I even helped out disabled people on two separate occasions this weekend.

Friday: Had the day off, spend the morning/early afternoon with a gorgeous woman who was so far out of my league she was playing for Man United and I'm a sub on a pub team somewhere in the Orkney islands.

Then went up and saw my mates mid afternoon; Got two nice shirts that are dressy/smart but okay to wear with jeans or shorts and roll up sleeves to be causualy, two nice pairs of jeans too and a pair of raybans and ordered in a sexy belstaff coat. Got lunch as 2/3 of my mates can't find work and are on a tight budget. When I was waiting for my mum to pick me up from the shopping centre, I noticed a little disabled girl who was about nine and looked like she had severe muscular dystrophy had dropped her colouring book so I picked it up off the floor for her and put on her wheelchair tray and flashed her a grin, talked to her for a minutes until my mum pulled up and took me to her end.

Fuckall was happening Friday so I spent the night in with my mum whom I don't get to see much and we watched a film with our dog.


Saturday; Chilled out most of the day, helped my mum in the garden (did a ton of manual lifting and digging/planting) and then messed around with my dog in the shade and had a few beers.

In the evening I went to a small village near my hometown with some mates and enjoyed the beer festival with the weather and a decent brass band.


Sunday: Wished I hadn't drank my weight in beer for the morning and watched shit TV, then went into Sheffield and had some posh-ish lunch with a girl I've known for years and caught up with her then went shopping and got two more shirts and a pair of shorts.


Got the train back from hometown to Doncaster, halfway there it stopped due to signally issues for an **HOUR AND A FUCKING HALF** in the sweltering heat, nowhere near a station.

Finally it got going, got to Donny, missed the connecting train. Had to wait 20 minutes for another train, then when I finally pulled into the station in the town I'm living in, my shopping bags burst and shirts went everywhere, quickly fixed one and shoved all my stuff in there, too late the train pulled out.

Waited in petebrough for about an hour talking to some girls who were going back to Uni who were in a similar situation, then I finally got home as a sweaty agitated mess.


**tl;dr mostly good weekend but this evening was a right bastard.**

However, it will change a few times by the time you are ready to get a work permit, and with the way the immigration is tightening down in this country it might go away altogether someday.

Regarding going to university in America, credits don't transfer so if you realise you wanted to study abroad it'll be too late. Additionally, the name of the university doesn't really matter unless it's something extremely prestigious like MIT or Yale, so don't worry about going somewhere like a community college for two years then transferring to a state university.

The only plus side to studying in the UK is that you can build connections with employers, and if you switch from a Tier 4 student visa to a Tier 2 work visa you don't have to worry about the limit of 20,700 Tier 2 visas that they give out per year.

There are a couple of organisations which are based in Notts, they're all shit, but like I say, you can do it for three months and earn some cash.

Place I worked for paid £7 an hour, plus a £30 bonus for each sign up after your fourth that week. There was a guy earning about £50k a year from it, but he was stupidly good. Also, as much as people may hate you for it, no one was ever massively rude, at worst it was 'not interested, bye' and shutting the door. Go for part time, and pick up extra shifts, too, easier to get bonus that way.

Oh, and you may actually raise some money for charity, if you're good at it. I worked 6 shifts, got two sign ups, and they were more than happy to keep me with that strike rate. I quit because it was winter, and I was walking around in the dark for 5 hours wearing 7 layers and still freezing my arse off in the rain. Good luck with the job hunt, if you literally find nothing else, there's always this.

We'll see.

I believe Ferna will be a fan favourite at City, and the reason is simple: we trust that his intentions when moving clubs were pure. It's really hard to know whether players move because of economic incentives, or if it's because they really want to play for a club. With City it's especially tough, since we're a mega-rich club. It's so god damn annoying when I get comments from people regarding every player we buy. 

*""He only came for the money, he doesn't care at all about the club.""* is probably something you're all used to hearing. But with Ferna he's made it clear he came because he really wanted to be a part of our team. He early on posted pictures with the MCFC logo, expressed his wishes publically, and is taking the change of culture and adaption seriously. I'm proud of this transfer!

This is why the unionist parties fought tooth and nail to prevent a referendum from ever happening in the first place - why, in the last Parliament, it was blocked and why Wendy Alexander had to go.

Once the SNP won the election with an outright majority - which wasn't supposed to happen for this very reason - a referendum was inevitable and that the majority of matters would have to be decided prior to the referendum. Once the SNP's white paper is published and the agreement is laid out all the ""impossible"" and ""too difficult"" problems will be seen for the scaremongering they are and the reasonableness of the settlement will make a ""Yes"" inevitable. The parties in Westminster have understood this for some time; that as soon as the SNP won their majority the game was up for the Union.

Edit:

Worse still for the Labour party; depending on what happens to Scottish MP's immediately after the referendum it could mean their hopes of winning the 2015 election evaporate overnight.

With Sturridge making runs in behind that, it's devastating. It seems to me that Rodgers has an idea which isn't a strict 4-3-3 but one in which the top three players are very interchangeable and always switching positions. Coutinho, Sturridge, Suarez, Aspas (though he hasn't played yet, his signing is indicative of this trend), are all players that can play along the top line which is what has made the link up play unpredictable and effective.

Suarez tends to drop deep as he always wants the ball. This is why it will be interesting to see how he and Sturridge operate if Suarez stays.

There was that possible leak that says he's the real 9th incarnation but because of his actions none of the others will recognize him as a 'Doctor' so he has been hidden. I'm hoping its much more complicated than that, but I'm 100% certain he's a regeneration.

&gt;I don't think the Dream Lord is the Valeyard mostly because we've seen so few references to the classic series. But I agree that it might be building into the Valeyard.

We've seen *tons* of references to classic who. We've had the Valeyard mention itself, Androzani, mentions of his granddaughter, the finale (which was basically a huge reference), Ice Warriors, the 2nd Doctor's bowtie making a guest appearance, UNIT, the mention of Lethbridge-Stewart, the 7th Doctor's umbrella appearing in the Christmas special, the image of Hartnell when the Tardis recognized him last season, and Tennant referenced stuff that happened in Classic Who every other episode for awhile. 

And I don't necessarily think the Dream Lord *is* the Valeyard, but both are the darkness in the Doctor. One is the current form of it (Dream Lord) while the other is still coming and coming hard (Valeyard) so while they aren't the same person they're manifestations of the same darkness and temperament.

* Hard pressed middle class. &lt;-- It's the working class that are suffering the most
* MPs wage rises for themselves &lt;-- MPs can no longer do this
* They claim every single expense &lt;-- Untrue. Not all MPs are corrupt and with the media scrutiny now I suspect the vast are honest
* A government nobody voted for &lt;-- We elect members of parliament who are free to form their own parties and coalitions between them
* Politicians who have come out with the plans to destroy society &lt;-- Conspiracy theories...
* Blaming the liberals &lt;-- Even though we've barely had liberals near government, it's been social democrats and neo-liberals. It's unclear if he means the American definition of liberal.

In any case though he does the typical populist trick - he uses emotive language to explain why he's on your side, without making any divisive choices, while blaming everything on the 'establishment'. The intended end result is that you walk away thinking he has all the answers, when in fact all he's done is list the problems (or lie about the problems) and spread some platitudes, which providing exactly zero answers. The reason there's no answers? Simple really, as soon as you read fascist policies you realise they're either batshit crazy couldn't happen, or batshit crazy evil.",0,1373255219,null,0,false,0,caxzw51,t3_1hu1kk,t1_caxzw51,t1_caxxodv,null,1430548435,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

I mean I know that there is alot of sexism in the world of entertainment and that is bad, but I'm so tired of the complaining. I know there is plenty of Doctor Who sexism, but at this point I just wonder why do they watch? If bloggers don't like it, then why don't they stop watching and more importantly stop blogging about it? I like the show, and yeah I know it has sexist faults, but I hate people using me as a dartboard for their complaints against the sexism in the show. (yeah that sounds a bit mellodramatic, but those instances are surprisingly common for me.) Yeah I know the sexism is  there, yeah its not cool, but I still love the show and if you don't then don't watch and don't try to start arguments with me about how its terrible!

I think there are worse examples of it elsewhere and the worst people can say about Doctor Who is that the characters aren't 4 dimensional enough and there is the occasional joke. Can't we just enjoy watching the doctor doing his thing without turning every aspect and character into a college ""gender studies"" essay? And if the show's ""sexism"" bugs you too much then don't watch anymore. No? 

Granted the flip side to that is ""don't read the blogs"", to which I can only laugh and say touche. 

Also I want to say im not one of those guys who thinks the doctor can't be a woman. I think that it would be bad for the 12th, because there has been almost no precedent set, but I would love to see a woman actress play the doctor.

Pretty much exactly what happened to us. We were all ""LOL aww yiss. Now I can get a gallon of sweet tea with my 47 piece nugget meal"" and posting a funny ad from Mcdonalds. It was a joke. (actual post from last year)

But sure enough, in no time extremely obese rednecks were posting bacon burritos and other hideous concoctions assuming we were not being satirical, but actually serious. Like we were ""proud"" we could engorge ourselves with such obscene amounts of food.

We posted joking shots of George Washington fist fighting bears while holding a massive flag, or a redneck with a shotgun waving a flag in a storm, within a year actual rednecks were posting pictures with actual shotguns shouting ""Merica"".

Looked into it and realized that I could both study law and move back to the UK, and as a bonus it's actually cheaper, even with the exchange rate. That might give you some idea of how insanely expensive it is to get a law degree in the US, haha.

Instead we build off a few stars through the youth system and developing underrated talents.

Especially the whole not burning down my whole city. I can't count the times i've said ""I am displeased with the government, I wish I could burn down my own city."". See, in Britain you can do that. And apparently it solves everything. (London riots 2012)

Same goes for racism. I can't count the times I've been sick of immigrants, and thought ""Hey, why can't I just join a club (EDL) and march in favor of literally evicting these Muslims from my country.""

I would be so happy if I could use the term paki on a daily basis and have nobody say shit otherwise because we are just that ""reserved"" and ""polite"". (read pussy)

I've also always sat around and said ""You know what sucks? Having my own freedom too choice 500 channels of entertainment. You know what would really rock? Having like 5 maybe 6 channels, all hosted by one massive corporation (BBC). Than I can bitch about what they broadcast on /r/britishproblems near weekly! Because I have literally NO other choice! And everyone knows that ""Quiet desperation is the English way."" Because Britain has roughly 10 famous people, so everyone has heard what they have to say over and over again.

I also hate the fact i pay $2000 a year less for car insurance. I hate the fact that an identical pair of headphones costs $100 less here. I hate the fact that my roads are paved yearly, and aren't pure shit. I hate the fact that we don't use French traffic designs that have world wide reknown for being bullshit.

So many times have I looked back and wished my rulers shouted ""Shoot me with thine arrows Pagans, for god will protect me.' Only to be shot with every single arrow and have the entire country fall to invaders like a house of cards. (King Edward) THAN, hand the country over to a fucktard (King Alfred) who basically does nothing but kiss the ass of those French surrender frogs into helping us, because obviously they just suck at war and aren't totally the only reason we even exist. (William 1066,Danish invasion of 9th century) Who of course, will not come, and the Danish will rape every single English woman on that Isle, once again, reducing the ACTUAL British blood to mere tenths.

Or the fantastic leadership in India, leading to one officer shooting down an entire crowded street of women and children because, and I quote, ""His horse didn't have enough room to get through and no one was listening.""

The football riots, the political riots, the ""It's tuesday"" riots. The just riot riots.

Bringing it home here, my second favorite part is the fact that my home would have almost literally no resources to itself at all. And almost all of my sustainability comes from outside sources and the economy. Meaning if all that failed tomorrow my country would instantly revert back to 1065. and suddenly the realization that we say ""Blood piss and shit"" every 5 seconds is because we are barbarians in a small cage.

And lastly, I can't count the times i've said ""My lineage is too pure, if my homeland could only be .0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001% British and 1% Danish 1% German French Norman and every other race within rock tossing distance of the isles with enough sticks to invade that would be glorious. Than I can ""invent"" some form of false unity over the fact we are all stuck on this shit rock floating off the coast of Europe together.

You guys only get away with the self-righteousness because nobody is ever  interested enough to read about British history. If they actually did holy shit would things go entirely differently. They don't even teach it to you! I had a 14 year old Englishman from Kent tell me he had no idea who William was, or any of the Kings before the asshole one that decided he would measure distance by the length of his own foot.

It's honestly like you guys start British history at 1066 with the Annals of England and ignore fuck all else before that. Which is ironic, because it was one of the bloodiest shit infested isles in the entire world. Literally. As in gutters were used to attempt to filter human shit out of the streets which lead to massive disease (cholera and TB). Honestly. It's just to easy to do this guys. Burn those history books, they only hurt you.

Luckily here in America ""knowledge r dum"" so absolutely nobody knows about any of this but me ;) They honestly think you guys sit around in fireplace lit lounges sipping brandy, smoking pipes, and saying ""nnnI say govna', pork bellies are up this week. We shall invest in it!""

Fear not, I will never tell them. They will never know Britian is mostly ""Oi bruva, I swear on me mums life ya cunt I will feck u up"" football chavs. Or the fact the police are so goddamn anal they installed CCTV on every street corner and will literally ticket you for riding a bike on pedestrian pavement.

true,Dazzorifik,,Brad Guzan's left glove,"Welcome to the subreddit! 

Although we had a relatively poor start to the season last year, I felt that we gained confidence towards the end. In my opinion, it was the performances of Brad Guzan and Christian Benteke that ultimately kept us up. 

Villa are in a transition period. Gone are the days of signing older, experienced players on high wages. Now, with Paul Lambert, we are focusing on building a young and hungry squad with high potential. 

We still haven't cleared all of our high earning players off the books; with Shay Given, Stephen Ireland, Charles N'Zogbia and Darren Bent still in our senior squad. However, we have cut loose a lot of older players already: Richard Dunne, Alan Hutton, Andy Marshall, Brett Holman and Jean Makoun. 

Our star performers from last season are Brad Guzan, Ron Vlaar (Captain), Matthew Lowton, Ashley Westwood, Andreas Weimann and Christian Benteke. 

Benteke, one of Paul Lambert's first signings, is now one of European football's hottest prospects after a phenomenal return of 23 goals in 39 appearances. We are facing a fight to keep hold of him for the upcoming season, which is why Paul Lambert has been so active in the transfer window, in an attempt to convince him to stay for another season. 

We have been unusually active in transfers so far this season; signing Antonio Luna (Defender from Sevilla), Jores Okore (Defender from F.C. Nordsjælland), Jed Steer (Goalkeeper from Norwich City), Aleksandar Tonev (Midfielder from Lech Poznan), Leandro Bacuna (Midfielder from FC Groningen) and Nicklas Helenius (Striker from Aalborg BK). 

Although all of these players are young prospects, the most promising are generally considered to be Okore and Tonev. However, fans are starting to trust our scouting network a lot more after the influx of great young players last season. 

We are still after a creative midfielder. Apparently we were chasing Younes Belhanda from Montpellier, but the deal fell through after he agreed to join Dynamo Kiev. We are still being linked with several players though, although the accuracy of such reports are in doubt: Gareth Barry, James Milner, Scott Sinclair, Joleon Lescott, Tom Huddlestone and Hiroshi Kiyotake. 

Personally, I think that the squad has grown in confidence since last season, and with our new signings we should have no problem avoiding relegation next season. Some experience is still necessary, but our young players will only get better with age. My prediction is that we will finish between 9th and 12th. If we get lucky, we could possibly go on a cup run or grab a Europa League spot. However, we are still a squad in transition, and a comfortable mid-table finish will be our primary objective.

true,Andures,null,null,"While not a Liverpool fan, I was sent a link to this thread, particularly to the comment by szlafarski below (I am pretty sure it will be below, considering the number of downvotes, though mine will not likely stay positive for long). While not a regular commenter on the football subreddits, I would like to say something as someone who is married to a Scouser. 

The vast majority of Liverpool fans are, to some degree, living in a fantasy. It is the same fantasy as those who long for a return to the golden years of Imperial colonization, or those who dream of being a pirate in the West Indies; almost bordering on the kind of fantasy that Tolkien fans wish about being transported to Middle Earth, the sci-fi geeks who go to sleep in the hope that they wake with the Mutant X gene activated. 

The dream of Liverpool is a glorious one. Dominant in England and Europe during the 60's, 70's and 80's, they rose to become one of the THE premier football clubs in the world. Five-time winners of the European Cup/Champion's League, with their latest victory an incredible comeback from 3-0 down that borders on the miraculous. Little wonder, then, that the allure of history continues to be a glamour before the fans of Liverpool. 

Today's Liverpool, however, are far from the titans of yore. Their troubles are well-documented, from a disastrous ownership by the American demons, Gillett and Hicks, to lacklustre performances under club legend Kenny Dalglish. It is a dream that has been shattered over and over again. 

Hopes were high in 2007, when Liverpool reached the Champion's League final for a second time in 2 years. This, proclaimed the fans, would give us a double of AC Milan, and finally help solve the off-pitch troubles, re-propelling us back into the echelons of European football. It did not happen that way, and the grand hope was destroyed. When Dalglish was appointed as the caretaker manager (and subsequently full-time manager) after the dull, tepid reign of Hodgson, the dreams returned. This was, after all, the *numero uno* club legend of Liverpool, the man who deserves the nickname of 'God' more than a cheeky striker with a plaster across his nose. This man, the King of Anfield, who had once brought them 3 First Division titles as a player-manager and led Blackburn to become the ONLY Premier League winners in the first five years of the competition not named Manchester United, this man would bring glory back to the illustrious club. Once again, as dreams go, Dalglish was proven to be but a man, and he was unceremoniously sacked after leading the club to a paltry eighth place finish. 

Liverpool fans, therefore, have been subject to an endless loop of that scene in the movie Inception, falling backwards on a chair into a pool of water, their dreams hopelessly dashed. 

The result of this is the fierce optimism of Liverpool fans, fans who request, nay, demand for the very best, to the extent that they will fervently defend every little thing which happens to them as a cloud in silver lining. When Suarez was first charged for racism, Spanish experts from the Merseyside popped up like toadstools after a rain. It is linguistic context, they yelled after looking up a few wikipedia articles. When Dalglish was lambasted for showing support to Suarez, the cries of 'Innocent before proven guilty' were deafening. Suarez's 'incarceration' for biting Ivanovic was met with overwhelming demands for consistency in judgments from the FA. Even the most ardent called it a good learning experience for Suarez. The optimism never ended, because deep in the hearts of Liverpool fans, there was always going to be a golden sun at the end of the storm. Which is why when Liverpool were linked to Mkhitaryan, their hearts exploded. 

Prior to May 2013, it is safe to say that Henrikh Mkhitaryan, from the football-poor country of Armenia, was a nobody to Liverpool fans. He was, after all, playing in the unglamourous Ukrainian league, one of the 'border towns' of European football.  Overnight, Youtube compilations of the man saw their views skyrocket. Top scorer in Ukraine as a midfielder, they said, a sure sign of quality. Living in the training ground became an act of absolute devotion to football, telling of a man who removed himself from the glam and luxury of the modern footballer. Comparisons to Gerrard, Lampard and even Dalglish were thrown out by fans eager to convince themselves that this man with the unintelligible surname would surely be the saviour of the Kop. For weeks, the Kopites worked themselves into a frenzy, devising numerous nicknames for the man who had yet to put on the red jersey. The saga probably peaked when a picture of a man resembling him was put on twitter, with claims that Heno, as he was known to the Armenians, was waiting in the lobby of a hotel in London, presumably for Ian Ayre, Liverpool's chairman. The picture spread like wildfire, and Twitter, RAWK and /r/liverpoolfc was consumed by the flames. In the end, though, it fizzled out, just as the transfer seems to be, and just like how Liverpool dreams have been over the last few years. Nobody asked the question 'How do you know this picture is of a hotel lobby in London', when the picture first spread, because Liverpool fans did not want to ask the question to which answer they may not like. There is another question, which Liverpool fans also neglected to ask during the sage: 'Why would Mkhitaryan, if he was so good, want to join Liverpool?'

The three big 'successes' since the departure of Fernando Torres have all shared one thing in common: they were all, to a certain degree, a pariah at their own big club. While deeply loved by Ajax fans, Luis Suarez was serving an eight match suspension for, lo and behold, biting an opponent, when he made the move to Liverpool. The prospect of a selling a 'troublemaker' for over 20 million pounds was too much for Ajax to reject. Generally hated across the world after his handball in the World Cup, Suarez was unlikely to propel Ajax, perennial winners of the Eredivisie, to any further heights. Daniel Sturridge, the young prospect poached by Chelsea from Manchester City, was facing limited playing time at the London club after they famously bought Fernando Torres for 50 million pounds. His frustrations were understandable, because he was constantly overlooked despite performing well at Bolton on loan. Torres, after all, was well and truly earning his new nickname of '50 million pound flop'. Coutinho, once lauded as the future of Inter Milan, had become a forlorn character in the San Siro. A tiny Brazilian overshadowed by the big, bad Italians, he seemed doomed to join the list of promising Brazilian youngsters who never made the cut. In the end, Liverpool reinvested the 50 million pounds from the Torres sale into a talented PR disaster, and two young bargains. 

It is this that Liverpool fans should take note of. Their biggest recent successes in the transfer market have all been considered somewhat 'undesirable' in their previous clubs. They all came from big clubs who were regulars in Europe. Two of them found themselves unable to get a place in the lineup, or if they did, it was in a position unsuited for their talents. 

Compare this with Mikhitaryan. This man broke the scoring record in Ukraine. He was a regular of the first team. His club are, more often than not, champions of Ukraine. If he was as good as Liverpool fans supposed he was, there was no reason for other, better options to present themselves than Liverpool. Unlike Sturridge and Coutinho, who were young talents unable to break into the first team, or Suarez, who is a walking tabloid headline and hate magnet, there has been nothing negative about Mkhitaryan. The only way for Liverpool to sign him would have been if none of the other big European clubs cared for him, which would elicit the question of 'how good is he really?' As it seems to be going, the 'perfect' player for Liverpool is most likely not going to be playing for Liverpool. 

Liverpool fans have to realise that the 'perfect' player is not the perfect player for them. They have to rely on bargains, on players looking for redemption, or those who have been overlooked. Players like Aspas, who carried Celta Vigo to avoiding relegation while receiving a suspension for headbutting an opponent. Players like Luis Alberto, who was loaned out by Sevilla and passed up by Barcelona. Players like Mignolet, for whom playing for the likes of Manchester United, Manchester City, or Chelsea, is but a dream, and whose position as Belgian goalkeeper has been usurped by a 21-year old youngster on loan at Atletico Madrid from Chelsea. These players all come with a slight blemish on their resume, a blot that makes scouts of bigger clubs hesitant. These are the players for whom Liverpool needs to procure, players who are hungry for success despite being passed up for recognition. Players just like the Liverpool fans themselves, who lust after the hopes of lifting trophies once more, who see themselves as exiles from their rightful home of the Champion's League. Players who see themselves as better than what their *curriculum vitae* portray them to be. 

Liverpool fans need to find players whose profiles fit the same fervent desire that the Kop vocalises on a weekly basis. Players who arrive with a doubt on their backs, and a burning need to remove it. Players who are desperate to prove themselves as truly deserving of their hype. Liverpool fans need to find players who share their dreams of grandeur, because, as that infamous night in Istanbul back in 2005 once showed the world, when dreams are united, miracles can occur.

true,Andures,null,null,"While I am unfamiliar with what Liverpool fans say on this subreddit, there are countless times when Liverpool fans have stated on /r/soccer that Liverpool needs to do such and such so that they can 'return' to the Top Four where they 'belong'. I have seen many who say that Liverpool 'deserves' to be in the Top 4, and have set that benchmark for Brendan Rodgers over the course of his contract.

The post about Mkhitaryan being spotted in London is 11th when you sort the subreddit by Top posts. 228 comments and 331 upvotes. 

The regular dream, as I've stated above, is that Liverpool fans constantly use rhetoric that implies their 'rightful' position as the top of European football. For fans of teams like Tottenham and Everton, such rhetoric seldom exists. They 'hope' and 'try' for Top 4, as is proper, but it is seldom framed as a position that they 'should' be in. 

If, as you say, this subreddit is one of the more level-headed places that Liverpool fans congregate, then the question must be: Why are Liverpool fans elsewhere behaving as such? The bigger question is also, why do the Liverpool fans here let the fans from elsewhere continue this way? 

In the day and age of social media, fan opinion can sometimes be a huge influence. There have been many many Manchester United fans who urged their fellows not to boycott the club on a green and gold issue. Imagine if the movement actually succeeded and there was a real boycott of the club. The damage would have been catastrophic. 

It is a phenomenon that amazes me, because such behaviour is more-or-less unique to Liverpool fans. Perhaps it is due to the unique circumstances of Liverpool, but it is something that I did not see even during Juventus' sojourn in Serie B after the corruption scandal.

Instead of basically Coventry (as I imagined it to be, but bigger), it really is a beautiful city with beautiful architecture (just look up!), great restaurants, cool people (Brummies are seriously just as nice as Geordies and with a slightly better accent) always up for a laugh and meeting new people. It's laid-back, a bit slower, and I really love and appreciate how diverse and multi-cultural it is without the feeling of segregation London can sometimes get.

Well, in the time before you scuttle off, make some memories. Home is always a bit of a shitter because it's home and it's boring. Best memories are made on trips, so, I don't blame you! I hope something on this helps you out and you have a great summer!

However, I can't agree with your faith in the British media. 

One thing /r/uk has that the British media hasn't is a fully-functioning bullshit detector.  The BBC, in particular, does little more than regurgitate press releases these days, with little or no added analysis or commentary.  Certainly, they rarely challenge obvious government bullshit.  At a time when we have a government that is deliberately smearing certain groups of people and is waging war on the poor and the disabled (unopposed by Labour), the BBC's acquiescence is a national disgrace. The Grainy is more willing to take on the government, but also pushes an absurd left-wing agenda that has almost no support in the country - not even on r/uk, which is fairly liberal on most matters.  I don't read the Economist or the FT so I'm not qualified to comment on them, but for variety, many of the Telegraph articles linked on this subreddit are hilariously manipulative - rare birds being killed by wind turbines and such bollocks.

I would suggest that vishbar and other foreigners are doing the right thing by gauging r/uk's reaction to news stories - the British media really benefits from having the commentary track switched on.

Had an incident here the other week. Heard the worst puppy scream and at first thought a dog had been run over.

We bombed it out of the house to see if we could help in any way, and came upon 2 guys with 3 staffies and a puppy between them trying to tear chunks out of each other, the owners had no idea what to do, none of their dogs seemed to know any commands, so the guys' only option was to pull the dogs apart by the muzzles, getting their hands nicely chomped in the process.

So what next? Separate the dogs you might think? Or no, let's all just stand around so the dogs are still together and then resume their fight!

We told them, GET THE OTHER DOG OUT OF SIGHT, as we couldn't do anything until the dogs calmed down...

As soon as that happened though, all the dogs began to settle. And we could see, not one of them was neutered, turns out the 2 bigger dogs were males, the 3rd was a female and she had her little pup with her and we think that the passing dog tried to get too close to the pup, hence the screaming and it all kicking off.

So, we have 2 dogs with injuries that will need vet treatment, and a guy with blood dripping all over the place, but both guys seemed most worried about the police being involved, so, after getting the dogs calm, trying to bandage the hurt guy's hand and telling him he needed to get that looked at, they all just fucked off. And neither at any point said a word. 

It was just weird. These people were arseholes and I wanted to keep the pup. I felt so sorry for all the dogs involved. Staffies are great dogs with a rotten reputation, and our kennels are full of them, all because these little punks think the dog makes them look tough, or worse still dog fighting.....

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"&gt; While I am unfamiliar with what Liverpool fans say on this subreddit, there are countless times when Liverpool fans have stated on /r/soccer that Liverpool needs to do such and such so that they can 'return' to the Top Four where they 'belong'. I have seen many who say that Liverpool 'deserves' to be in the Top 4, and have set that benchmark for Brendan Rodgers over the course of his contract.

- Return is accurate, belong and deserves are entitled. 

- Measuring Rodgers against the benchmark of top 4 within 3 years is not unreasonable, I feel. Not because we deserve it or it's where we belong, but because 3 years of squad building should allow us to either reach the top 4, or come very close to it (5th). I'm not saying Rodgers should be sacked if he doesn't get there, either.

&gt; The post about Mkhitaryan being spotted in London is 11th when you sort the subreddit by Top posts. 228 comments and 331 upvotes.

- So? It's a piece of bona fide transfer gossip, and everyone loves that. He was also an actual club transfer target - this isn't Edinson Cavani or Isco we're talking about, this is someone the club decided they actually had a shot at getting. Are you suggesting we should have downvoted or ignored a piece of possibly pertinent, but definitely interesting, information about a transfer target?

&gt; Why are Liverpool fans elsewhere behaving as such? 

- History and the inherent optimism of being a sports fan, probably. Right now it perhaps seems like something unique to Liverpool fans, but it's not; Rangers fans will feel the same sense of deserving to be at the top of Scottish football, and I'm certain that if someone like Arsenal or United, hypothetically, dropped out of the top 4 then there would be those amongst their ranks that would say they 'deserved' better.

- But more pertinently, who cares? Why's it matter that some fans feel more entitled? It's their disappointment to deal with, nobody else's.

&gt; The bigger question is also, why do the Liverpool fans here let the fans from elsewhere continue this way?

- Because people have a very limited degree of influence over the thoughts of others in any context, let alone amidst the anonymity of the internet where the topic is something as irrational as sporting fandom. And see above; who cares? Personally, I have better things to do than reason with fans on RAWK, or anywhere else (including here, sometimes)

&gt; In the day and age of social media, fan opinion can sometimes be a huge influence. There have been many many Manchester United fans who urged their fellows not to boycott the club on a green and gold issue. Imagine if the movement actually succeeded and there was a real boycott of the club. The damage would have been catastrophic.

- I honestly don't think social media has had as much of an influence as you're making it out to have had. I think modern clubs have, sensibly, realised that there is an extremely low signal:noise ratio on social media outlets, and so don't heavily interact with fans through that. Beyond that, it's just a case of managing fan expectations, which comes down to good PR and the manager

- I don't think the green and gold example is a good one, because plenty of people will agree with the sentiments behind that movement. Essentially, those fans were willing to compromise the performance of the football team they supported for what they felt was a much greater goal, which was emancipating their club from overseas owners that didn't have sufficient regard for the club as a community institution, evidenced by the insane amounts of debt placed upon the club. There are similar fans amongst Liverpool supporters, and Arsenal supporters, and so on and so forth; plenty of whom feel that the modern game is far too divorced from its working class roots, and for them that's a bad thing.",0,1373275407,null,0,false,0,cay4j50,t3_1hup9l,t1_cay4j50,t1_cay4b6b,null,1430546020,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

true,Andures,null,null,"&gt;why should fans tell each other how to behave? 

People tell other people how to behave all the time, it is how society works. If you were at Anfield, and you hear a Liverpool fan shout something racist, chances are you would report him to a steward. This extends to other forms of abuse. In addition, people also tell others within the same community to not be assholes, or to speak softly, or not to use too many vulgarities etc. It's quite common. 

&gt;You mean something like the anti H&amp;G fan protests that were referenced as a reason why RBS sold the club above their head? Or maybe the campaign for fairer ticket prices which has been spearheaded by the Liverpool supporter's union?

The biggest reaon why RBS sold the club above H&amp;G was because they were unable to secure refinancing for their debts. To state that the anti-H&amp;G protests were an influencing factor would be to say that RBS would have come to a different decision had the owners been supported by the club, which is absolutely baseless and probably laughable. 

Fan-led movements can be for the good, or they can be negative, which is why I stated that fan opinion is a strong influence in today's world. It is the 'how' that is the matter. 

&gt;Do you speak Italian? Were you on many Italian football messageboards back then? Or in Turin?

While I am not Italian, I was in Italy during the time, and lived with a family who were Juventus fans. Most of the sentiment that they translated to me was one of anger towards the corruption scandal because they believed it to be a conspiracy. However, they were also resigned to losing their best players following relegation, ecstatic when good senior players chose to stay with the club, and hopeful that they will be able to groom youngsters into good players. While they **did** believe that they belonged in the top of Serie A, very very little of them were angry at players leaving. While not exactly similar, compare this with how the subreddit reacted when rumours of Suarez wanting to leave surfaced. (I've taken a bit more time on the subreddit, and read some interesting comments)

While I don't use espnfc, RAWK is commonly considered the number one place for Liverpool fans. If RAWK was misrepresenting how the majority of Liverpool fans really felt, wouldn't they be less popular? I'm fairly certain than RAWK sees a lot more than the almost 9000 subscribers to /r/LiverpoolFC. 

&gt;That doesn't make any sense. Fans will react to the players that their team is linked with. If we're being linked with Mkhitaryan, people will get excited about the prospect of him joining. Not about Siem De Jong just because that would be a more realistic signing, although never linked with us.

I believe I misrepresented myself in that statement, apologies. What I meant, was that Liverpool fans need to stop creating this common identity with so-called 'potential' transfers before they happen. The post was inspired by the article by Kristian Walsh, where the main point was that Liverpool fans were imagining Mkhitaryan as their Lord and Saviour, all before pen was put to paper. They were then horribly disappointed when news broke that Mkhitaryan was on the way to Dortmund. All of this despite the possibility that all of this could very well have been a non-issue. While I am not a journalist, I work for Reuters, and I see a lot of how, especially in sports journalism, false stories are created. Credible sources and newspapers don't only publish facts, they publish plenty of rumour as well. As long as they also publish news and facts, their credibility seldom takes a hit.

That's completely different to what you're talking about here. First of all you're not talking about match going supporters here. I'd hazard a guess that your 'Kopite wife' doesn't actually sit on the Kop and you're just using that as a term for a Liverpool fan. You're talking about fans on the internet. Why would any of those people listen to the people here? How many RAWK users are gonna care what the largely American users of /r/liverpoolfc think or say about them? I'm guessing you're into fantasy because you're not living in the real world.

&gt;o state that the anti-H&amp;G protests were an influencing factor would be to say that RBS would have come to a different decision had the owners been supported by the club, which is absolutely baseless and probably laughable.

It was literally referenced in the courts decision. I'm not saying it made the crucial difference but it was undeniably a contributing factor. Also, I still can't understand why you reference the Green &amp; Gold campaign (who I actually have a lot of sympathy with), since that campaign died pretty quickly after Ferguson told fans to stop protesting. What exactly was your point?

&gt;While they did believe that they belonged in the top of Serie A, very very little of them were angry at players leaving. While not exactly similar, compare this with how the subreddit reacted when rumours of Suarez wanting to leave surfaced.

Honestly you'll find just as much anger at Suarez possibly leaving as apathy. A lot of people are angry at the nature of it: The public interviews courting moves, claiming he wants to leave because of press pressure and because of how his family are allegedly treated (which is completely unfounded in Liverpool at least). To be honest, a lot of people in here, like me, sort of understand why Suarez would want to leave. He came here for a career move and it hasn't worked out for him; we're still seventh. If he's insistent on leaving and a club like Madrid pay an appropriate amount of money for him, then I won't begrudge him. I'll just pine for his return like I always do when my favourite players leave for better things.

true,Andures,null,null,"&gt;Measuring Rodgers against the benchmark of top 4 within 3 years is not unreasonable, I feel. Not because we deserve it or it's where we belong, but because 3 years of squad building should allow us to either reach the top 4, or come very close to it (5th). I'm not saying Rodgers should be sacked if he doesn't get there, either.

There are other clubs in the Premier League, with equal or more resources compared to Liverpool. Manchester United, Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham are easily deservedly above Liverpool. The idea of expecting Rodgers to reach 4th after 3 years of improvement seems to be reliant on the other clubs declining, which is a little strange. 

&gt;So? It's a piece of bona fide transfer gossip, and everyone loves that. He was also an actual club transfer target - this isn't Edinson Cavani or Isco we're talking about, this is someone the club decided they actually had a shot at getting. Are you suggesting we should have downvoted or ignored a piece of possibly pertinent, but definitely interesting, information about a transfer target?

It was a purely unsourced piece of rumour that could have come from anywhere. It could literally have been a picture of someone who looks like Mkhitaryan sitting in the lobby of a hotel situated in anywhere from Russia to California. Having come from an account which had made 1 previous post ever, it was quite literally less credible than The Sun. The fact that it was this heavily upvoted spoke of a frenzy. 

&gt;History and the inherent optimism of being a sports fan, probably. Right now it perhaps seems like something unique to Liverpool fans, but it's not; Rangers fans will feel the same sense of deserving to be at the top of Scottish football, and I'm certain that if someone like Arsenal or United, hypothetically, dropped out of the top 4 then there would be those amongst their ranks that would say they 'deserved' better.

It is quite different from Rangers, considering how they were kicked out of the league altogether. Liverpool, on the other hand, have been in a steady decline through the bigger part of 2 decades. 

&gt;Because people have a very limited degree of influence over the thoughts of others in any context, let alone amidst the anonymity of the internet where the topic is something as irrational as sporting fandom. And see above; who cares? Personally, I have better things to do than reason with fans on RAWK, or anywhere else (including here, sometimes)

It is also something I struggle with, the strength in which people, in situations often as far removed from the sports club they support as possible, stick to their identity of being a fan of such-and-such club. Somehow, they create an identity that they share with other people, people with whom they share nothing other than the football club that they watch.

true,Quazz,capaldi,Capaldi,"&gt; and I believe he found out from a database onboard the TARDIS that indicated his death at Lake Silencio (which obviously, is Italian for Silence).

From the Tesselecta actually, he just copied the data to the TARDIS. 

&gt;If the Hurt Doctor was in the database for the Doctor to discover, then wouldn't it not really be a secret at all? If his timestream contained future incarnations (Hurt), then where were the other ones?

Well, if you noticed, the desktop theme of the ""dead"" TARDIS was the current one. So either the Doctor will die permanently soon, which would explain it (but isn't realistic from a writing point). 

So the other option is that it's yet again a fake grave/tomb. I believe the blatant stating of River Song having a false tomb is foreshadowing to this fact. 

Additionally, I think the battle of Trenzalore will be at least part of the 50th anniversary. I also think John Hurt will be the one to fight this battle and that this will be why he is the one who broke the promise. But in the name of peace and sanity as otherwise a paradox would occur. And this would be pretty damn bad as the Doctor, at least up until the end of 12 is fixed now due to his Timeline existing in the TARDIS tomb.

So they'll create a fake TARDIS tomb, with a timeline up till 12. 

I mean, the timeline is supposed to be of his entire life, right? So how come there are only 12 in there? It makes no in-show sense for that to be. The Doctor explicitly stated it were all the days he lived and even the ones he hadn't yet. So there HAS to be his future in there somewhere. 

There are tons of ways he could have known about John Hurt in advance though. One theory is that he saw him through the Untempered Schism and that's why he started running. That would indeed be a secret. But as I said before, it could simply be because he saw him already when he was 10, so he already knows what's up. 

It's obvious 11 saw him in his room in the God Complex. But why would he be so afraid of his past? You can be ashamed or guilty of your past, sure. But afraid? It makes no sense to be afraid of it. Fear of your future, on the other hand, is very common. Especially if you know what's coming and it's something horrible. 

11 said he never really wanted to find out what Trenzalore really was. People assume he was just talking about his ""grave"". But what if he's talking about the battle? About his future?

Seriously though, I think part of the reason why it's so level headed here is because of the amount of Americans (or wherever else). I think it's easier for them to be level headed, football isn't a major part of their culture, they're not forcefully surrounded by it as much, it's not everywhere they go. It's ingrained in the culture in Britain and Ireland and I think being surrounded by it every day contributes hugely to the sort of disillusion you see from some supporters as there's no escape from it. There are so many fair weather and average Joe supporters that make up the majority and these people are more likely to have a disillusioned opinion. I'm not saying this applies to everyone of course.

I don't really want to compare the two in terms of quality and say one is better than the other, they both have their qualities, but /r/liverpoolfc has nowhere near the recognition of RAWK, the average supporter has heard of RAWK and it's a very accessible place for them to go, while more than likely they've never heard of Reddit and finding/r/liverpoolfc wouldn't exactly be easy for them so they don't end up here.

If they actually believed that, if they actually saw Scotland as somewhere that was just as British as wherever they are from then surely they wouldn't react in such a way when seeing it being celebrated? 

If you believe that we are all British then Scottish achievements *are* British achievements and waving a Saltire *is* waving a flag for Britain. We are a nation of nations, we have many flags, we have many unique identities as well as a good few shared identities. If you claim to embrace that fact but then act like a churlish prick when one particular identity that you don't happen to share is celebrated.. then... what the fuck?

Honestly I'm sick of it. I'm sick of these little assumptions whereby if you're proud to be Scottish you must dislike being everything else. By politicians no less. Not only is it patronising bullshit but it's inconsistant, when was the last time a Welshman was given hell for waving his flag around? No apparently *being Welsh* doesn't undermine the British national identity enough or something. I don't fucking know.

I don't think he *did* plan it.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"Look, I'm not going to continue a quote-by-quote discussion; all in all, you come across as a person who either does not understand sports fandom, or do not subscribe to the notion that sports fandom can exist outside the bounds of rationality. (This isn't meant as an insult.) Dispassionate analysis, voices of reason, and general common sense have their place in sports, but so does opinion, conjecture, bias and irrational thought. 

I really can't emphasise enough that a lot of what you've described about Liverpool fans could be applied to many other teams, were they in our situation. Spurs &amp; Everton, which you mentioned, didn't have the same prolonged history of being in the top 4 until very recently that we do; hence my hypothetical example of how United &amp; Arsenal fans might react to a similar plight, even if you disagree with the example of Rangers. If a grainy photo of Thiago in a hotel in London was uploaded to /r/reddevils, things would go equally batshit crazy; ditto Cavani to any club. Plenty of Arsenal fans think the club should have won, or better challenged for, a title (not just a trophy) in the last 8 years, despite the financial burdens of a brand new stadium.

I'm really not sure what your goal is here - if you're trying to understand why sports fans (in this case Liverpool fans) are the way we are, then opine less and ask more.

true,baycitytroller,cnty-scotland,Shang a lang,"In my opinion it is down to the combination of a number of factors, although I am sure there will be many who disagree with the conclusions I have reached - it's just my opinion.

Firstly polling evidence; The [Scottish Social Attitudes Survey](http://www.natcen.ac.uk/media/1021487/ssa12tables.pdf) is one of the few surveys that has a significant Scottish sample and as it has been carried out for a number of years now it provides a useful insight, especially when you go further than the headline results that the MSM report on. The two tables on page 3/14 show that there has been a persistent majority in favour of tax and welfare decisions being made in the Scottish Parliament. The table on page 6/14 shows that an overwhelming majority are in favour of the Scottish Parliament having the most influence over the way Scotland is run and that this has been a persistent result. The results on page 4/14 shows that when support for independence and devo-max (""The UK government should make decisions about defence and foreign affairs: the Scottish Parliament should decide everything else"" = devo-max imo) is combined it holds the majority. Other polling evidence has shown support for devo max (if that was all that was on offer) to be in the majority - some polls over 70%.

Secondly Devo-max or any form of ""jam tomorrow"" will never be on offer despite all the unionist parties saying they are considering what further powers to devolve (that Labour will not put their full proposals forward until after the referendum says a lot). Full blown devo-max would essentially be federalism, however none of the structures for federal government exist in the UK and would require Westminster to legislate. Johann Lamont (Labour leader in Scotland) recently made the modest proposal that all income tax should be raised by the Scottish government (not corporation tax or petroleum revenue tax or any of the other taxes) and was promptly told to get tae Falkirk by her own Scottish Labour MP's. If she cannot persuade Scottish MP's from her own party of her case then what chance has she got to persuade Labour MP's from Liverpool or Manchester never mind Conservative MP's from Bucks or Kent - as this again would require Westminster legislation. Why is this important? The table on page 4/14 shows that there is a solid 30% (24% + 6%) against any further constitutional change while there is a solid 35% for independence. So the people who will decide the outcome are the 32% who currently prefer devo-max. When it becomes clearer to them that there can be no further change without Westminster's approval and that this is unlikely (especially full blown devo-max which would require nothing less than a revolution in Britain's constitutional arrangements for which there is no support in the rest of the UK) I would suggest that many of them will tend to the ""Yes"" side come the referendum, especially when you consider the survey responses above about influence and where decisions should be made.

Thirdly many believe that when the Scottish Government publishes its white paper you will struggle to get more than a fag paper between it and devo-max.

Lastly, when the two governments publish their agreement on what would happen after a ""yes"" vote most (if not all) of the scare stories will melt away. As I said above the ""No's"" have a solid 30% support. The remainder of their support is very soft however. Straight yes/no polls on **current** voting intentions hide the fact that there are different levels of ""No"" - there is, however, no other way for the polling companies to report the results. ""No"" might mean just that or it may mean ""No, but if my questions about pensions could be answered then I would vote yes"" or ""No, but I haven't really thought about it and could be persuaded to vote ""Yes"""". All very different answers - but still recorded as a ""No"". The SNP, however, have been polling over a long period asking people to rank their ""No"" on a scale of 1 to 10. They are reported to have been saying that the ""No's"" are moving from more certain to less certain (although until they publish their results many people will say ""they would say that, wouldn't they"" - although that doesn't mean that they are making it up). This movement the SNP claim to be seeing, I believe, is evidence of people starting to see through the scare stories.

So, IMO, when you combine the attitudes to where decisions should be made, the impossibility of devo-max ever being on offer, the proposals in the white paper being as close to devo-max as is possible and the removal of most of the scare stories when the inter-governmental agreement is published there is little doubt as to what the result will be.

My guess is either the UK (and probably most of Europe) will be stuck in a cycle of decline over the next decade or two - in which case austerity won't end, it will become more like a prolonged political ideology - Japan is a good example of this. OR, the recovery will be very gradual... I mean slow... like glacial! In which case I don't think anyone in government is ever going to necessarily announce an '*end*' to austerity... instead budgets will gradually move from making cost effeciency savings to becoming more balance-sheet neutral. That said, the UK has some major social issues that even under optimal conditions will take decades to resolve, like our housing crisis - my guess is once any cash becomes available it is likely to be creamed off for that sort of stuff... and more cynically probably reimbursing the political/economic elites who have largely funded the cuts so far.

The problem with a post-war comparison is that the world was so very different then - and indeed the very concept of the UK (being an empire) makes it hard to construct a good comparison. But to use it as an example, post war we often forget that despite ending in 1945, rationing continued until 1954 (and even influenced food production as far away as the 1980s) and national service (effectively conscription) continued well into the mid 1950s.

It’s the villages full of people who find having a high-speed rail link under a mile away doesn’t help their property prices where the problems start. It’s the endless public consultations, appeals, delays, compensation claims, compromises, diversions…

The further you get down the design process in major engineering programs, the more making minor changes becomes prohibitively expensive. Heck; I've had design changes to remove redundant items from designs turned down, because running through the engineering change request process at that stage in the program would be more expensive then the tens-of-thousands of pounds it would save. 

That’s why the risk pot is nearly a third of the budget, and why they’ve stated the risk pot is only sufficient to cover very minor changes in scope or route.

The cheapest way to do something like this is to railroad (ahem) all public concerns, weigh up the benefits/downsides at the outset, then commit to the program and follow through regardless of what happens. It’s the low-level political interference which always drives up costs.

You're a bit young, but an often cited route is a TEFL course which allows you to teach English somewhere in East Asia (and elsewhere). Usually requires a degree, but I hear some do not. They will pay you, albeit not amazingly. Other than that, the only other thing I can think of which won't cost you is being an au-pair (harder for a guy) or the French Foreign Legion.

Also. Not everything in IT requires a degree, and they're becoming less and less positive in terms of cost-benefit. I personally give little credence to any potential applicant with a degree, even in CompSci. Far more interested in the projects chosen or the extra curriculas. If you wish to stick with web dev/design, concentrate on getting a portfolio together and being an active presence in the community/online, whether that be something CMS specific or just generally.

Also, that type of work tends to be the most common you find on sites like peopleperhour if you wish to make some extra money.

Use your free time to explore if you wish to divert to a different IT area, such as programming, project management, networks, security, support, infrastructure, etc. Then work out how you will break into it. Just remember you are still young, it isn't massively important you know for sure what you will spend the rest of your life doing, now :).

true,eastlondonmandem,english,INGERLAND,"&gt;The thing that 'makes-sense' is to stick at my current job, learn a few web-languages and eventually work my way into a better company.

I would agree. You can jack it in now and search for what you really want to do but in the short term you will be putting yourself in a worse off position. How are you gonna find what you really want to do if you don't have any money?

And I don't believe there are any genuine dead-end jobs especially not in web/marketing. You do your time and then go somewhere else. I've never worked my way up the ladder in any company, always left in the same position I joined but doing that I've been able to earn much more money than if I stayed around for years.

I'm getting on for 30 and have been working for nearly 15 years. I started work after my GCSE's without a single qualification so that's definitely not a barrier to achieving. Don't want to say how much I earn now but it's significantly more than all of my friends who went to university and got degrees.

I've felt like you have many times in my life, working in a job which I hated and feeling like I'm not going anywhere but I persevered and always looked forward. Having been in a job for 6 months which I hated, I would stick it out a bit longer, 12-18 months so that I could move onto my next role without it affecting my C.V. (too short a term at a company looks quite bad to a prospective employer)

So ultimately my advice would be to suck it up, keep working but keep looking at your options, think positively. Don't just jack your job in and expect your life will get better. The first couple of weeks might be sweet, no need to get up to go to work but if you stay unemployed longer term it's likely to be a decision you will regret.",0,1373284647,null,0,false,0,cay5rfr,t3_1huvzz,t1_cay5rfr,t3_1huvzz,null,1430545440,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15

I made an arse of my GCSE's at school. I went to college for a year to resit English and Maths and a couple of other things.

Then I got a low level technical job which sent me to college on day release and I got my BTEC HNC after two years. I then left that job and kept moving up every few years.

I wouldn't recommend anyone going to uni in the UK considering the state of affairs and lack of jobs unless it was specifically required for the work you want to go into (Dr, Solicitor, Architect etc). You also leave uni with a load of debt in most instances.

Seriously, there is nothing worse than running into the Miasma of someone's super Strength Skunk while I am walking through towns/Cities/Woodlands.

This is where the difference between Cannabis and alcohol/Cigarettes differ, Alcohol only effects the person drinking it, smoking only effects the person smoking it or people with a certain vicinity for a fixed period of time (and even now more people are becoming Vapers) and Weed simply sticks whether you are smoking it our not, makes you get the munchies or get high.

The secondary effects are far far worse than 'Legal' alternatives.

If you hate your job, then quit. Its not worth sticking in a shitty job for a long time that doesn't even pay enough for you to save money so you can move out of your parents place. All that happens is you get more miserable and might miss out on some of the best experiences in terms of fun, and learning life skills (e.g moving out while still young.)


BUT


Do NOT quit your job without another one lined up. Look for other jobs, apply online and in person. Get involved with job agencies! I found the job I am in through an agency, which took me from working as a supervisor in a shop (complete dead end with not much money, enjoyment or anything else good) to working in sales for a small-ish company where I feel valued, get better money and can see a future for myself.

I would start looking for a better paid job. You're young and will be looking for entry level positions, so specialised qualifications wont be so much of an issue. Your commitment to the job will also be relatively low, so if you were able to save a load of money to go travelling, its not a big deal for you to quit.

Well the solution there is to not stand next to people smoking weed.  I imagine it would be prudent though, were it legalised, to have laws enacted for smoking in public, but I imagine that's what would happen anyway.  I think it would be fair if public weed smoking was limited to coffee bars or something.  I feel that stinking a place out with weed stank isn't so much harmful, but just rude.

&gt;again as stated elsewhere, this is under the influence of alcohol, at time of consumption you do not hurt anyone except yourself while consuming it.

Right, but people are still affected by the consequences of you drinking, just in a different way.  Yes, people wont get passively drunk by being in your presence, but they might have to suffer other things that you wouldn't experience with a pot smoker, such as picking fights, drunk driving and a third example I can't come up with.  I'm just trying to point out that weed isn't inherently worse than any other drug, as long as it's used sensibly.

In certain IT trades, such as website development, an employer will look more at what you've done, than any piece of paper you might hold. If you have a good portfolio, even with no qualifications, you would be chosen ahead of a candidate fresh out of university with a compsci degree and only his personal site to show.

Also in this industry, who you are is important, too. You're likely to end up working in a small agency with an open-plan office. Being able to interact with people is important as these environments are often fun, vibrant, and up-beat. The stereotypical compsci nerd would not fit in well. It's also often a very customer-facing role, and you'll be in direct contact with clients a lot of the time.

Source: I've studied compsci and most people on my course were pretty much archetypal nerds with no social skills. I've worked in web development, and recruited in web development. 

Example, we decided not to interview one particularly impressive candidate (1st in compsci, impressive Java project) as he had none of the experience he needed. Another guy we invited to interview, but he didn't really get along with is. It was awkward. Finally, we settled on somebody just out of college (no university degree), but had spent a lot of his own time doing small projects for local charities and small businesses. It turned out extremely well for all of us.

I dont think anyone thinks for a minute that we arent going to sign a marqee player, even if Suarez stays.

I personally love Hendo as a box-to-box midfielder.  He's not Gerrard, but he provides a ton of quality and is still young.  Also gets a ton of credit for his improvement over the course of last year.  If we see the same jump from season 2 to 3 as we saw from season 1 to 2, I think we will be very happy with him.

My concern is Suarez.  If he leaves, there is really no one that we can replace him with.  Basically it would take two players, a creative midfielder and a striker.  I still think our best option we can get right now would be Erikson (or obviously, someone I never heard of who our scouting staff finds!  :))  Our other ""option"" would be someone young (like Shaarway*) who can play that outside attacking midfielder and cut inside to shoot, but that's not gonna happen.  Most of that style player are not going to come to us this year.  Now, if we make champions league, then next summer there is a chance of attracting that type of player, but that is a catch-22.  We need that player to reach champions league, but we need champions league to attract that player.

This sounds completely reasonable. If you can prove you are creative, and talented, you do not need formal education to get into good media/programming jobs. But you need to take it seriously. You've gotta know the full HTML5 spec inside and out, and then get onto using Ruby, and something more serious, probably Java. And then flash. If you're going to go the ""no formals"" route, then the places that will employ you will generally be small companies, with a heavy creative background.

Every week, take on a new challenge. Think of it like building a CV. I don't know. See if you can make an HTML5 implementation of pac-man in less than 1kb. Make a simple face detector using your webcam and a Hough transform. Make a new GUI for youtube that does something useful (oh, like finds further episodes from the show you are watching and puts them to the left in an ordered list). Build these things up. You learn how to solve problems, and you build up a portfolio. Just Get excited. Branch out even further. Buy an arduino kit and make a little light sensing robot (oh! Combine it with the face detection I mentioned above, and make it so it swivels a webcam to follow your face. Flash + Arduino + a £5 stepper motor + an H brdige chip will be enough to make that happen)

But the idea of dropping out to find find yourself is bullshit. If you've got enough time in a day to make a post like this, you've got enough time to think ""what excites me?""",0,1373295309,null,0,false,0,cay899h,t3_1huvzz,t1_cay899h,t3_1huvzz,null,1430544264,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,nikcub,lfc68,null,"It is much much more nuanced than that. In summary, nobody bans ""third party ownership"" because it needs to be defined properly what that means, you can't just add a line that says ""third-party ownership is banned"". The elements are:

* Being able to purchase a share in a youth player registration

* Being able to purchase a share of a player currently registered at a club

* Being able to transfer a part-share of a player registration from one club to another

* Being able to transfer a part-share of a player from one club to another in a different league

* Which countries and corporate structures are allowed to own shares in a third-party player registration

* How much of a player registration is a third-party owner allowed to own

* How much is a third-party owner allowed to influence the movement of a player

There are about a dozen more, at least from my experience reading the rules and regulations (often translated poorly). The trend is that England and Germany ban or do not allow all of these elements while Spain, Brasil etc. allow almost all of it. Germany definitely does not allow the transfer of a third-party ownership of a player registration.

And it doesn't even matter in the Mkhitaryan situation, since *both* countries do not allow third-party owners to be involved in player negotiations and have to strictly remain silent. The club are their proxy.

Also third-party ownership is the English and UEFA terms, many other leagues have laws and regulations of a similar effect but using different terminology.

Third party owners have been very very silent on the continent this year, to the point where clubs are coming out and denying that players are even partly owned.

We have outstanding potential in our attackers but we're just one more impact player away from really hitting it huge in the attack the way that United, City, and Chelsea do.  Sturridge seems to get injured a bit more than I'd like (he's not really super injury prone, he just seems to miss a few more games than normal due to knocks and such), Aspas needs to adjust to the EPL, Borini, Sterling, and alberto are young yet (though I expect Borini to impress this season if he doesn't break himself again), and Suarez may not even be at Liverpool come opening day plus if he is still at the club, we can't use him for the first 6 matches.  Micky was supposed to be that last piece of the attacking puzzle to bring that extra bit of consistency, depth, and dynamic threat to the attack, but now I'm not sure what we'll be up to or if we'll give it a go with what we've got.  I'd really like to see one more really solid signing for our attack though.  There's lots of talk about Eriksen now but he doesn't quite fit the role that Micky was going to play and IMO is too similar to what we already have and not quite the right choice.  We want a more direct player at this point as we have Coutinho, Gerrard (in his new role... a young Stevie would be PERFECT for what we're trying to find right now and that's really what Mkhitaryan reminds me of in the way he attacks), maybe Alberto, and perhaps Suso (if he doesn't go on loan I'd imagine he sees some action at least in the cups) to control the attack and pull the strings, which they do a a really good job of.  Henderson looked like he was starting to really find some traction playing in a more direct attacking role towards the end of the season and there's a part of me that wants to see him get that extra responsibility because I think he has the potential to become a very immense player for us.  But then there's another part of me that doesn't really think he's quite ready/good enough for that crucial role just yet.  BR also talked a lot about how Allen's best role is a more attacking position last season so I wonder if we'll see him given a shout in there.  I personally like him more as backup for Gerrard's position where he can make the most use of his tidy passing and exert some real control over our possession game.

Defensively we have a bit of work to do.  While Allen can cover to Lucas, he's clearly not comfortable there as it's not his natural position and he's not the sort of tackling destroyer that Lucas is.  Allen is great in his ability to recycle possession and reads the game well, but I don't think he has the size or physical presence to sit in there the way Lucas does.  We need to find some more natural cover for this position.  

I wouldn't mind seeing a new CB come in either as it seems like Skrtel really struggles with BR's preferred style of play and Toure is a bit up there in age.  I do think Toure is going to be impressive and we tend to underrate him a bit, but he's not a complete answer.  I also freaking love Martin Skrtel and I really hope he proves me (and the majority of us) wrong by adapting to the new style and putting in the kind of great performances we got used to from him a couple of seasons ago.  But, assuming he can't do that, we really need to find a good, strong, young(ish) CB who can really step into the first team. 

It would be nice to see some competition and depth at LB too.  Robinson doesn't seem to be quite making the grade at this point and the players we've been linked with are very promising (Digne is a beast and the guy from Sevilla who's name escapes me right now for some reason looks like he's got bags of potential and already does quite well at just 20 years old).",0,1373295744,null,0,false,0,cay8eh3,t3_1hv2by,t1_cay8eh3,t1_cay790o,null,1430544197,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7

Also, Mourinho is going about making the right noises. He is talking about a long term plan. He is building a squad; with focus on depth. He can afford to rotate the important players, and not rely on Mata to play week in and week out. He is trying to address our weaknesses at DM, the rumours around Di Rossi are a good indicator in this regard. We are just a few signings way from having two good players at every position. Some of our most promising players have at least a year of EPL experience now.

tl;dr: Have faith.

Now, Man U lost Ferguson, Man City got a new manager, Chelsea's young loanees looked awesome and they are coming back with confidence to play for the first team, Chelsea are very much in for the title this season.  They may not be favorites, but they aren't expected to finish in a distant 3rd like they were last year.

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"The biggest problems the author has against Villa are that he is too old to be the jewel spurs so crave and that his stats don't tell the full story - he has been scoring freely against weaker sides but not so much against the stronger ones.

&gt;Too old

If spurs were buying Villa to be 'the future', then this would be an issue. But Villa will be an experienced leader to mix in with the youth and also a stop gap until something better comes along. What I mean by that is when spurs land CL football, the type of strikers available (and the prices they will be available at) will be far better than the current targets. For example, if spurs got CL football last season then Llorente and Damiao would almost certainly have signed, this season spurs could legitimately aim to poach Higuain, or buy Jovetic. 

Villa will be gold in an attempt to grab CL football, after that his age will force him to take a back seat whilst a new striker takes the reigns. The author says that spurs should instead look at getting players like Higuain, who are unobtainable due to a lack of CL football anyway...

&gt;Can't score against big teams

Villa played a combined 70 minutes this season against the likes of Atletico/Real Madrid. To say he had 5+ games to score a goal isn't very fair, he only played 30/30/10/0/0 mins respectively. 

Similar story in the CL. 16 mins one game, 8 the next 10 the one after that. You could say he played those three games, or that he played 34 mins. The goal/assist he did get in the CL were clutch, one against AC Milan to put Barca through and the other against PSG to send them to the next round.

All of this aside, spurs biggest issue last season wasn't getting up for games against the likes of Man U or City, it was unlocking parked defences, teams like Wigan and QPR. Being a Barca player Villa almost exclusively plays against parked buses and yet punches out either a goal or an assist every 88 minutes (10G6A in 1411 mins), who would say no to someone who contributes better than a goal a game!

I am not on the Villa bandwagon, but this article takes an unfair swipe at him. Stats look at goals scored without factoring in the fact he was barely on the field. Say he won't be as good due to a leg injury 2 years ago, even though it hasn't affected performances yet and finally it says he won't be a good fit because he won't be around forever, which isn't what spurs would be buying him for in the first place.

My final point. Benteke, whom everyone seems to want. Scored 19 goals in 2819 mins, got 4 assists as well.

Villa (mostly from the left), got 10 goals and 6 assists in 1411 mins (half the time).

None of the studies you linked to make a distinction between cannabis and skunk, the effective chemicals of which are the same, though in different concentrations. 

Anxiety and psychosis are two drastically different things. The last sentence is a bit useless there, it's the same as anyone saying they prefer being drunk, or they prefer smoking cigarettes.

obviously there is a need for a third striker as Dempsey/Kane are either not a true striker or too young. however do we really need some kinda of world beater who is gonna cost so much. Spurs need a good squad player who won't mind coming off the bench playing cup games and filling in when either ade or defoe need a breather/are injured. Spurs can get away with this because Bale is Bale and Paulinho looks to be a better scoring midfielder. for example look at Chelsea last season. their top three scorers in all comps were a striker, winger and midfielder (Torres, Mata, Lampard. http://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/chelsea/top-scorers ). in fact I don't see another striker in their top six outside of torres. 

my point being that we may not necessarily need a ""world class striker"" or even a great striker to come in to be successful. so much of AVB's system is midfield base (at least from what I have learned) that the striker is not as important in scoring goals as they might be in a more traditional 4-4-2.

A silver lining from all this is that hopefully Coutinho will be able to make the central role his own this season. I see it as Suso's natural position too, so I really think we're covered there.

I don't see any of those studies claim that cannabis **causes** anything, which has always been the crux of the issue.

It stands to reason that excessive usage will increase any potential risk, but as your own links show, it's hard to discern whether someone has developed a problem as a result of cannabis, or they are using cannabis to self medicate.

I think the ""Canabis 7 year study"" says it best:

&gt; and absence of good data has handicapped the development of rational public health policies.

Even when a risk of mental health problems from cannabis is taken as true, they admit keeping it illegal actually prevents us from making it safer.

true,pikeybastard,null,null,"Again, you've confused outcome with structures that permit outcome. A liberal, according to the definition of Ludwig von Mises, who of course represents only *one* interpretation out of thousands for what 'liberalism' actually is, said that: 

&gt; If a democratic republic (democracy) finds that its existing boundaries, as shaped by the course of history before the transition to liberalism, no longer correspond to the political wishes of the people, they must be peacefully changed to conform to the results of a plebiscite expressing the people's will.

For which the plebiscite has been granted. However to anticipate the will of the people, without referring to the consistent wishes and outcome of a plebiscite, is by this definition (and your own, which I can only assume references it) quite definitively *anti*liberal.

If Scotland voted for a separation from the UK, and it was clearly demonstrated that it was not a transitive, flash in the pan indication of the people's will, and not merely the result of electioneering, and people on reddit supported retaining Scotland against its will, then they would be anti-liberal (and again, this is merely following a very specific assertion of liberalism that you claim).

Regarding conservatism, you state that: 
&gt;To put it blunt. Conservatives on the other hand will do everything within and outside the law to stop anything changing, such is their nature.

Which is the most incorrect assertion that anybody has ever made in the history of politics. Conservatism, like Liberalism, is a very broad and dissolute church, so few absolutist claims will hold up. However one of the fundamental tenets of conservatism, coming all the way down from figures like Edmund Burke, David Hume and Richard Hooker, conservatisms 'founding fathers', are predicated upon the gradual evolution (at best) and emergent rather than revolutionary development of law. In other words, to a conservative, Law is everything.

When it comes to matters of conflict and war, that's a whole new ball game- suffice to say a liberal interventionist is far more likely to go to war than a conservative pacifist, and of course vice-versa. Contrast Neville Chamberlain to Tony Blair, for example.

Basically your argument is based purely upon prejudice, and the notion that everybody that disagrees with Scottish independence is wrong and a jerk to boot. Because words like liberal and conservative are conflated now with ideas akin to 'good' and 'bad', its a shortcut to saying ""We're good and noble and the other guys are at best ignoramuses and at worst malignant"".

1) - Unfortunately its often the agent marketing the property that leaves it on. Sometimes to attract good patrons such as yourself and offer them something else, and sometimes its in genuine error. Unfortunately they are in control of their listings, so there's little we can do to prevent that. However, we have introduced a feature recently that lets you report inaccuracy in a listing to us, which we'll follow up on. Have a look for the ""Spotted a Problem?"" section on the page, where you can tell us its no longer available. This contact form comes straight through to us, rather than the agent. If we can get enough users to mark ""gone"" properties for us, we might be able to build that into the search, and show listings marked as ""gone"" by x people differently to help filter them out. Kinda crowdsourcing the inaccuracies if you will.

2) The draw a search does generate a list view..what devices are you using? (Just in case its a buggy bug). If you are on a tablet, look for the ""view results"" button bottom right. Anything bigger than that you should be sweet to just scroll. 


Hope that helps.

Edit. You need verification its really us? (Try typing ""stroke city"" into the search - there's an easter egg for Derry / Londonderry that no-one really knows about).

true,Kesuke,null,null,"Ultimately Cameron is in a position of quite some influence to make such a suggestion -- though it is not his choice and **anyone** can nominate someone for a honour.

All nominees for knighthoods are broken down into 9 categorys of which ""sporting"" is one. **However**... a lot of sports personalities actually get ""community"" knighthoods for their charitable work rather than for their sporting achievments. 

Now *usually* sporting awards are given more like lifetime accomplishments rather than for a single impressive act. Awarding Murray a knighthood now seems premature to me as he is still quite young and his career only partway done. He will certainly get an honour at some point for what hes done - but i'd give him another 5-6 years to age a little and also give him time to perhaps do a little more.

It seems ironic that last August a committe of MPs said honours were being given out to too many celebrities and sprots personalities - yet heres Cameron jumping on a popularist topic that isn't the economy. 

Personally I found the whole &lt;camera pans to David Cameron/Alex Salmond/Famous actors etc.&gt; yesterday pretty disgusting. It says a lot about a game that has not entirely come free of its traditional class divide history. The Politician/celebrity circle jerk going on yesterday was totally inappropriate I thought. Even if they were there as legitimate spectators (lets face it, they were there to get some facetime with a popular guy) the camera should not have focused in on them.

Mental illness is a well known side effect of chronic cannabis use but tends to only arise if your family has a history of mental illness or you already have a pre existing condition. Probably not a good idea to smoke under that age of at least 18 either. There was a recent study that came out and was mentioned by the mainstream press stating that smoking before the brain is fully developed can damage it.

&gt;The evidence is consistent with the view that cannabis increases risk of psychotic outcomes independently of confounding and transient intoxication effects, although evidence for affective outcomes is less strong. The uncertainty about whether cannabis causes psychosis is unlikely to be resolved by further longitudinal studies such as those reviewed here. However, we conclude that there is now sufficient evidence to warn young people that using cannabis could increase their risk of developing a psychotic illness later in life.

Doctor Who isn't sexist. But it does have instances of sexism. Some casual sexist jokes under Moffat's run. The sexist writing of Abigail...but not much.

Martha did not fit this, nor did Donna. Amy didn't keep the Doctor out of any soulful brooding, nor did River. Rose did bring the Doctor out of his soulful brooding but she was a 3D character with flaws and a life outside of the Doctor. River is a strong and rounded character. It's clear that she is independent. The fact that her life revolves around the Doctor and we don't see her doing anything unrelated is a bit of a problem but is also a result of high time constraints for episodes. Only what is absolutely necessary is shown.

The problem isn't that the companions are MPDGs. It's that they're not rounded enough to come to life...well at least, that's how most feel about Moffat's companions and I agree to some degree.

The fact that Doctor Who's lead is a male isn't sexist. The show started in the 60s where there would hardly ever be a female lead, let alone in a show about education, adventure or sci-fi. Now what may be sexist (or at least cissexist, transphobic and possibly a result of underlying misogyny) is the fact that people are not open to the Doctor becoming female. If the Doctor doesn't become female, that's not sexist.  But there is a looooot of bias/prejudice that contributes to ensuring that the Doctor stays male.

Extreme analogy to highlight the flaws in that argument; If I inject vodka into my veins I'm probably going to have a bad time, should we start saying that alcohol is more deadly than heroin? 

I don't agree that mental illness is a well known side effect, the only evidence I've seen is poorly controlled studies or hearsay that can be summarized as ""My friend did the marijuana like cigarettes for seven years and when he didn't get his fix he got angry"" as their evidence. 
In these cases I suspect that their friend just had anger issues and cannabis helped him function normally without murdering his girlfriend and her parents before shoving a candle up his urethra, lighting it on fire and squatting over a bucket of gasoline one day.
  
Too much of a psychoactive drug is likely to trigger an underlying condition yeah that's what too much means, bad stuff happens when you have too much. 
Doesn't change the fact that condition was already there and blaming cannabis is like accusing a metal detector for putting metal on a beach after it starts beeping. It was always there.

Pretty sure spurs just blew their transfer fee record on Paulinho, a full Brazilian international who will walk into the starting 11, VDV aside I don't think spurs have shopped that high profile before.

&gt;You've got to twist in a situation like this, buy a class striker that the fans get behind, raise the hopes and take it from there.

And if that striker flops spurs fall behind 2 or so years in development which screws them. There is a Levy quote floating around where he has said he will not drop a bunch of coin on one player because spurs couldn't carry on their current path if that signing didn't work out. He will play the little to no risk option.

Agreed.

OP should develop his skills working on niche sites and small web-apps in his spare time.

If he finds the right niche he may earn enough to quit his job, otherwise they're awesome portfolio for searching for better jobs. 

I also think OP needs to define his life goals (or at least some short- to medium-term ones - 1 to 2 years in the future). I might guess that his A-level results were weak because he wasn't really interested and he didn't see them as a stepping stone to something else that he wanted. £5 an hour is crap, but I think he'd still be unhappy in an unsatisfying job, even with a pay rise.

1. ""Since it is not recorded as a cause of death by coroners, that information would be highly contended""

Just opinion, no facts to support your theory that cannabis kills. You fucking twat.

2. ""So by that I assume you DO believe that inhaling 2nd hand Cannabis from someone smoking next to you will have a neurological impact ?""

THC is a very VERY VERY light chemical, it's absorbed SO efficiently by the lungs that nothing comes out the other side. Wonder why you can't use 2nd hand smoke as a reason for failing a drug test? You fucking twat. 

3. ""But you agree you CAN get psychosis from Cannabis?""

There is no evidence for this theory, only studies which are 50/50 that either cannabis can make you go crazy or crazy people tend to smoke cannabis (which helps them control their crazy... weird how someone would want inadvertently medicate themselves if they were ill....hmmm...you fucking twat).

4. ""The guy I knew was pretty well balanced and then after 7 years on cannabis, any extended periods off it would see him (quite literally) turn into the hulk.""

See 3 but replace crazy with anger issues. Cannabis calms you. You fucking twat.

5. ""That is a Facetious statement. I have supplied evidence and proof ( what little there is) but you have failed to supply nothing but a statement of Fallacy ""

Going inception here, your opinion is that you provided a fact which was actually just an opinion that should have been ""I'm a fucking twat""

6. ""I have been out of the skunk and Cannabis scene for a good 8 years now, I barely remember what it was we used to smoke""

Skunk AND cannabis? You persist is making a distinction between the 2. They are just 2 words for the same thing, either you used to smoke the marijuana like a cigarette or you're a fucking twat. You fucking twat.

7. ""Considering Joints contain Tobacco, you are at least getting the same health implications from 2nd hand smoking, then add in the THC in Cannabis, this will have SOME kind of impact on a person inhaling the 2nd hand smoke.""

Firstly no, joints do not contain tobacco, they CAN contain tobacco - the word has different meanings all over the world but all it really means is cannabis wrapped in a skin of some sort. 

Look at ANY decriminalized or medicinal legal country and see how many people are actually smoking cannabis compared to those eating and drinking it, look at their shop fronts and see how the unrefined product is such a minor thing. There are SO many ways to ingest cannabis and all but 1 affects others and that effect is a snobbish ""eww i don't like that smell"".

Not including the fact that England is one of the minority countries that uses tobacco commonly when smoking cannabis;a your entire argument is based upon a different substance entirely being dangerous, you fucking twat.

8. ""After all I try to live by the Mantra ""Let Facts change your opinions, not let your opinions change the facts""""

Not fact, you do the opposite in fact. You go around spewing hearsay and myths you've picked up through your time on earth and not once have you actually stopped and tried to validate these things. You're a fucking twat. 


That was just the first page of about 22 comments of which only those 8 were relevant. I could of gone to page 2 but you're such a massive twat that I'd have to sit here all night trying to educate you and frankly it's not worth it. You completely disregard the medical benefits in favor of whining about smelling it acting as if you've never farted in a crowded room before you fucking twat. Do you have ANY idea how many people depend on cannabis to help them get back into society and start contributing again after being off work with an outlook of fucking forever at no fault of their own? You selfish fucking cunt.

&gt;Why would Spurs fall behind 2yrs in development if he failed

Because the money couldn't be recouped and you are then looking at dead weight on high wages in the squad. Spurs aren't in a financial position to drop 25m and then 5m a year in wages, if the player doesn't work out that would have serious business repercussions. The chairman said so himself.

&gt;You've named a player who may be available yes, but for loan, not heard anything as to suggest why.

But if someone writes about it tomorrow spurs fans will be begging for it to happen, this happens every window. People just want a shiny new toy. If City bring in a new striker (rumoured to happen) then Dzeko could move on loan. Doubtful, I know, but possible.

&gt;Basically nothing is guaranteed in life/football but it's high time we sorted the Striker situation once and for all, rather than a stop gap solution.

That is all well and good if it was that simple, but it isn't. There are no sure things, as you said, there is no guarantee that if spurs drop 25m on a striker it would work out.

It's also the case that quality varies considerably by department/subject -- even some of the universities which rank quite low down the league table offer some degrees which are well-regarded and highly sought after by employers. 


Which of the following are most important to you?

* The ranking of the university
* The reputation of the university -- not just in Britain, but your home country (or wherever else you plan to go).
* The ranking of the university department to which you would be applying
* The quality of teaching at the university and/or in the department you will apply to
* The quality of research at the university and/or in the department you will apply to
* The employability of graduates
* The satisfication of graduates with their courses

You can get data on the last two points here: http://unistats.direct.gov.uk/

Also, the city that the university is in might be quite important, so consider:

* Whether you are interested in a campus university, or one located at the centre of a city
* How good the transport links to home are (this is one reason why Kent is very popular with European students)
* How exciting the culture/museums/nightlife etc is
* What the cost of living is likely to be in your chosen city. 

There is no single university that fulfills all of these criteria.

&gt;Fouls 43

For somone of his height and strength, he loses the ball too easily and misplaces a lot of passes, and spends too much time going forward, and ending up out of position, leaving us open to a counter attack. (No way can Karacan hold off three attackers on his own). If Carrico can get properly fit, we're fine for DMs, especially with Guthrie as well.

Pog I can take or leave in our squad - he got a lot better towards the end of the season, but doesn't shoot enough. Sure his goal % is high, but it's only because he will only take a shot when he's certain. True, it means he's not wasteful with it, but he's a bit too conservative for my liking.

Gorkss is on loan now isn't he? Good. Fine at championship level, but we should try and grab some cash for him while we can (like with Legs).

I think Roberts will stay on for a season solely to help coach Samuel &amp; Ugwu - both of whom are strong pacey strikers. I can definitely see Samuel getting some game time in the cups this season.

Who would I like to bring in? If the rumour mill turns true, then I'd be really happy to see Lambert in hoops this season. He's a talented striker, who already has a good rapport with Adkins.

Comment: it's at least good that he's doing this now, as opposed to mid-August. If the club is going to sell him, it has time to look for somebody else.

Question 1: What are the chances the club says, ""Fuck off, you're staying"" ? I can't see Suarez actually going through with a strike or not playing...I was downvoted in another thread for suggesting this, but why wouldn't/shouldn't the club just keep him anyway? Supposedly United has done that at least once to Rooney and, as much as it pains me to say this, that has worked out *pretty OK* for them...

Question 2: OK, so if we are selling Suarez, definitely, who can we get to ""replace"" him that's available and might actually be willing to come?

The Pros: The money can be good. You'd do a three year cadetship, which will give you a qualification and the right to sail as an officer. Junior officer's make generally between £30k - £40k. A captain (obtainable after about 10 years of sailing) can easily make over £70k. 
Depending on what kind of ship you're on, you may have the opportunity to visit some cool countries. I've been to a tonne, including Tahiti, Sri Lanka, New Zealand, China. 

The cons: It's quite a dangerous job, and because of this can be very stressful. Almost every person who has been in the merchant navy for any length of time has witnessed at least a few heart stopping ""oh fuck"" moments. 
You'll generally be out of the country for 6 months of the year. A typical working pattern is 4 weeks on 4 weeks off, but this can vary from company to company. 

It's not for everyone. It's a tough job, but if you're feeling totally hopeless at the moment, it could be something to consider.

&gt;"" VO: But a world without fear was not what the neoconservatives needed to pursue their project. They now set out to destroy Henry Kissinger's vision. What gave them their opportunity was the growing collapse of American political power, both abroad and at home. The defeat in Vietnam, and the resignation of President Nixon over Watergate, led to a crisis of confidence in America's political class. And the neoconservatives seized their moment. They allied themselves with two right-wingers in the new administration of Gerald Ford. One was Donald Rumsfeld, the new Secretary of Defense. The other was Dick Cheney, the President's Chief of Staff. Rumsfeld began to make speeches alleging that the Soviets were ignoring Kissinger's treaties and secretly building up their weapons, with the intention of attacking America.

&gt; DONALD RUMSFELD, US Secretary of Defense, Speaking in 1976: The Soviet Union has been busy. They've been busy in terms of their level of effort; they've been busy in terms of the actual weapons they've been producing; they've been busy in terms of expanding production rates; they've been busy in terms of expanding their institutional capability to produce additional weapons at additional rates; they've been busy in terms of expanding their capability to increasingly improve the sophistication of those weapons. Year after year after year, they've been demonstrating that they have steadiness of purpose. They're purposeful about what they're doing. Now, your question is, what ought one to be doing about that?

&gt; VO: The CIA, and other agencies who watched the Soviet Union continuously for any sign of threat, said that this was a complete fiction. There was no truth to Rumsfeld's allegations. But Rumsfeld used his position to persuade President Ford to set up an independent inquiry. He said it would prove that there was a hidden threat to America. And the inquiry would be run by a group of neoconservatives, one of whom was Paul Wolfowitz. The aim was to change the way America saw the Soviet Union.

&gt; MELVIN GOODMAN, Head of Office of Soviet Affairs CIA, 1976-87: And Rumsfeld won that very intense, intense political battle that was waged in Washington in 1975 and 1976. Now, as part of that battle, Rumsfeld and others, people such as Paul Wolfowitz, wanted to get into the CIA. And their mission was to create a much more severe view of the Soviet Union, Soviet intentions, Soviet views about fighting and winning a nuclear war.

&gt; VO: The neoconservatives chose, as the inquiry chairman, a well-known critic and historian of the Soviet Union called Richard Pipes. Pipes was convinced that whatever the Soviets said publicly, secretly they still intended to attack and conquer America. This was their hidden mindset. The inquiry was called Team B, and the other leading member was Paul Wolfowitz.

&gt; Professor RICHARD PIPES: And the idea was then to appoint a group of outside experts who have access to the same evidence as the CIA used to arrive at these conclusions, and to see if they could come up with different conclusions. And I was asked to chair it, because I was not an expert on nuclear weapons. I was, if anything, an expert on the Soviet mindset, but not on the weapons. But that was the real key, was the question of the Soviet mindset, because the CIA looked only at—they were known as ""bean counters,"" always looking at weapons. But weapons can be used in various ways. They can be used for defensive purposes or offensive purposes. Well, all right, I collected this group of experts, and we began to sift through the evidence.

&gt; VO: Team B began examining all the CIA data on the Soviet Union. But however closely they looked, there was little evidence of the dangerous weapons or defense systems they claimed the Soviets were developing. Rather than accept that this meant that the systems didn't exist, Team B made an assumption that the Soviets had developed systems that were so sophisticated, they were undetectable. For example, they could find no evidence that the Soviet submarine fleet had an acoustic defense system. What this meant, Team B said, was that the Soviets had actually invented a new non-acoustic system, which was impossible to detect. And this meant that the whole of the American submarine fleet was at risk from an invisible threat that was there, even though there was no evidence for it.

&gt; Dr ANNE CAHN, Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, 1977-80: They couldn't say that the Soviets had acoustic means of picking up American submarines, because they couldn't find it. So they said, well maybe they have a non-acoustic means of making our submarine fleet vulnerable. But there was no evidence that they had a non-acoustic system. They're saying, ""we can't find evidence that they're doing it the way that everyone thinks they're doing it, so they must be doing it a different way. We don't know what that different way is, but they must be doing it.""

&gt; INTERVIEWER (off-camera): Even though there was no evidence.

&gt; CAHN: Even though there was no evidence.

&gt; INTERVIEWER: So they're saying there, that the fact that the weapon doesn't exist…

&gt; CAHN: Doesn't mean that it doesn't exist. It just means that we haven't found it.

&gt; PIPES: Now, that's important, yes. If something is not there, that's significant.

&gt; INTERVIEWER: By its absence.

&gt; PIPES: By its absence. If you believe that they share your view of strategic weapons, and they don't talk about it, then there's something missing. Something is wrong. And the CIA wasn't aware of that.

&gt; VO: What Team B accused the CIA of missing was a hidden and sinister reality in the Soviet Union. Not only were there many secret weapons the CIA hadn't found, but they were wrong about many of those they could observe, such as the Soviet air defenses. The CIA were convinced that these were in a state of collapse, reflecting the growing economic chaos in the Soviet Union. Team B said that this was actually a cunning deception by the Soviet regime. The air-defense system worked perfectly. But the only evidence they produced to prove this was the official Soviet training manual, which proudly asserted that their air-defense system was fully integrated and functioned flawlessly. The CIA accused Team B of moving into a fantasy world.

&gt; PIPES: The CIA was very loath to deal with issues which could not be demonstrated in a kind of mathematical form. I said they could consider the soft evidence. They deal with realities, whereas this was a fantasy. That's how it was perceived. And there were battles all the time on this subject.

&gt; INTERVIEWER: Did you think it was a fantasy?

&gt; PIPES: No! I thought it was absolute reality.

&gt; CAHN: I would say that all of it was fantasy. I mean, they looked at radars out in Krasnoyarsk and said, ""This is a laser beam weapon,"" when in fact it was nothing of the sort. They even took a Russian military manual, which the correct translation of it is ""The Art of Winning."" And when they translated it and put it into Team B, they called it ""The Art of Conquest."" Well, there's a difference between ""conquest"" and ""winning."" And if you go through most of Team B's specific allegations about weapons systems, and you just examine them one by one, they were all wrong.

&gt; INTERVIEWER: All of them?

&gt; CAHN: All of them.

&gt; INTERVIEWER: Nothing true?

&gt; CAHN: I don't believe anything in Team B was really true.""

I'm not sure I am... I think that's something we can disagree on though :)

&gt;However, this government is OUR government. WE voted them in to represent US. We didn't ask them to read our emails and text messages to ""protect us"" from terrorism. That's the part that reeks of the most bullshit to me. I accept that they can have access to my email etc, but they should have to go through the proper procedure of finding reasonable suspicion, then going to a judge and getting a warrant first.

Like many things in this country, there's been a deafening silence when calls for legitimate and open debate are made. From the whole ramping up of terrorism nonsense, to surveillance more generally (Do we really need more than 2 million CCTV cameras monitoring our public and private spaces?).

I cannot see what possible need there is for such high levels of monitoring of the public. Historically the British people are not even keen on civil disobedience besides a bit of rioting when things get really bad - revolution just isn't the done thing. So if they're not spying on us for those ends, what *are* they spying on us for? What possible need for this information is there?

true,Bash0rz,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"I am just about to have my final interview on the 7th and I get my ticket after 3 years of training if I pass, I am pretty nervous ha. I have done the engineering side but there is the deck side too if that's more your thing. I studied at South Tyneside near Newcastle but there are a few other places that do it too.

There are a few places to apply for. The main ones were [SSTG](http://www.sstg.org/), [Clyde Marine Training}(http://www.clydemarinetraining.com/), [Mearsk](http://www.maerskline.com/). Then you have the cruise companies like carnival and holland america, then there are P&amp;O ferries which some of the guys were on.

I was with SSTG which were pretty good and the pay was better than Cylde. Judging from the guys on my course I would avoid Clyde. Mearsk are a huge company and their training was definatly the best from what I could gather same as the cruise ships but there you have all the hairdressers and dancers to take you mind off things :P

One of the cooks on the last ship I was on was in the RFA for years, only as a steward but it sounds like it is a good crack and they are always off all over the place.

Just send your CV off to all of them and see which ones reply, pretty much what I did even though my Dad has been a Captain for years.

Hope that helps :)",0,1373320030,null,0,false,0,cayhpwv,t3_1huvzz,t1_cayhpwv,t1_cay9e4m,null,1430539733,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,mfanning1990,ZW,zimbabwe,"Well having a rich owner really helps, because if this year we fall short of the maximum loss (£5m), the club can release shares for the parent company to buy, up to £45mil, in order for the club to turn their debt into equity, to get below £5mil of debt. Next year it changes to £30 mil with Roman's propensity to leverage the debt. 

The only thing you have to look at is the transfer values (book value and profit and loss):

* Fernando Torres signed a 5.5 year contract for a transfer value of £50 million. ~£9.1 million a year would be counted in the books. 
* If we sold him now, he still has a book value of ~£27.75 million pounds, so anything less than that and we would have to record a loss in our books for that transfer.
 
and the employee benefits (wages, admin costs) vs the turnover (Income from gate, tv, transfers. prize money etc) Now we look at the higher number of sponsors recently. UEFA will investigate our sponsorship from Gazprom as it makes us look like we have received an unfair amount of money from them

I'll post more tomorrow night, but i have to get some sleep now, long day ahead!

true,Tailend22,cnty-england,Berkshire!,"This is a late comment, but I think I should say it.

There are several points I think you should consider.

1. You are at a very young age; you're not going to know what to do with your life. But that's ok! You shouldn't panic, or do anything rash such as quitting what seems to be a stable, comfy job. I understand it may look a bit terrible, with low pay etc. but compared to, say, flipping burgers at your nearest fast food place or scanning stuff at tesco, it's a pretty good gig.

2. Building on from the first point, being in that sort of job is a great head start compared to being in another minimum wage place. This gives you an opportunity to learn web-languages, skills that really build on your CV. It may not be what you want to do as a career/vocation, but it'll give you a leg up to getting a job that can support you exploring your own path.

It's what I'm doing at the moment - I left school last February and got a job in Telesales, and through some planning I was able to hop into an entry-level position as a First-line support guy at an IT company. It's not the best place to work, but I'm learning a load of information that makes me more employable.

I've made mistakes as well. Around September last year I panicked massively and thought I NEEDED to go into university, RIGHT AWAY - So I wasted £600 on online A-level courses that didn't really interest me. If I were to do it all again I'd be slower, realise that I'm fairly young, and be more careful.

Like Mount Doom, except with more **D**oom. So obviously the village had to select a hero, and many men stepped up but were made simply a Dragon's ready meal. They never returned, so it fell upon my shoulders to bear the burden of saving these young girls.

 Now I don't know if you've ever fought any dragons before, but a requirement is wearing a rather dapper suit of armour. So off I go to fit up in the armour, ready to take my rightful place as saviour of the village, but when I got there we soon happened upon a problem! The breast-plate fit tremendously, the greaves were heavenly, gauntlets no problem, but the ornamental helmet didn't fit quite right! So it was put to me that my hair was getting in the way, providing too great a diameter for the helmet to accommodate, and it had to go.

 Now obviously my hair is fantastic; so I wasn't best pleased. So uproarious was I that they had to lash me down and make short work of my hair, leaving me balder than a newborn babe. So off with my shiny chrome-dome I went and slayed the dragon, I won't go into what occurred with the females, and then I was worshipped 'til the end of days as a hero in that small, simple village.

true,miner_andy,num23,,"""The Premier League welcomes overseas players but remains aware of the need to sustain the development of home-grown talent.

Some of the world's biggest football stars compete in the Barclays Premier League, and while there are benefits in having overseas players in the competition, it is vital long-term youth policies are not affected.

Talented individuals can be role models for children and the more skillful players there are in the Barclays Premier League, wherever they are from, the better.

**To ensure that Premier League Clubs continue to produce top home-grown talent, the 20 Clubs introduced a Home Grown Player rule from the start of the 2010/11 campaign. Clubs cannot name more than 17 non home grown players aged over 21. For example some clubs will have a squad list of 23 because they may have 17 over 21 non home grown players.**

Visit the 'Squad' section within your selected club's profile to view its Home Grown and U21 players.""


What does this mean?  As you have up to 25 players in a squad (under 21s do not need to be registered to play), 17 of them may be foreign, but there must be 8 or more players who were trained by an English club for 3 years before their 21st birthday.

Some services do have charges, but the ones that always will not are:

* If you're in an accident and have to go to the Accident &amp; Emergency room at the local hospital.
* psychiatric treatment that is compulsory
* treatment for communicable diseases like flu or HIV.
* family planning

If you are employed in the UK by a UK company and are not a citizen, then you are entitled to NHS care. It should be a breeze for you as you're from an EU nation. 

However, there might be some charges for the following and here's where my lack of knowledge about NI comes in:
* prescription charges. In England, you have to pay £7.85 when you are prescribed medication.

Hopefully we can sell him for £35 million or so to Chelsea and watch him rot on the bench in Chelsea, and even miss the World Cup next year.",0,1373324455,null,0,1373324819,0,cayjbzo,t3_1hw5ii,t1_cayjbzo,t1_cayiaaf,null,1430538903,4,false,avfc,t5_2s569,4
