Say you grew up in some isolated community in another country and found a book describing the history of Britain. If you saw a description of modern Britain along the lines of that quote, you would not have Britain as it is today in your mind, you would have Bahrain. Which leads me to think that kind of view is a sensationalist piece of utter bollocks that is heavily influenced by the 'emergency' narrative that the Guardian seems to be perpetuating in order to develop and ground its recent move from guardian.co.uk to guardian.com and take a larger market share from the Mail online which still (and unfortunately) controls most of the market. 

Believe me or not, but read this wiki article. Read the 5 points by Frank Luter Mott, especially 1, 2 and 5, and ask yourself how many times have they applied to the Guardian recently.

&gt; However, not only is a 9+ KP(key passes) performance rare, it hasn’t happened at all in England either this season or last. That’s nearly 500 matches without one. I checked with Duncan Alexander at Opta, and he said the last person to do it was Leighton Baines in September 2011! So we’re actually looking at like 2 in 800 matches.

Also this part:

&gt; “[Eriksen] went into hiding, fitting with the stereotype of the scouting reports.”
&gt; Really? Dude had 81 touches, or 14 more than any other Spurs offensive player.  He was also only dispossessed one time. Townsend had 4 in a full match, Sigurdsson had 4 in 69 minutes. This statement is just silly.

Last but not least, this is the part I agree A LOT with:

&gt; “[Townsend] was good – at least he was trying his heart out.”
&gt; Andros Townsend has one fluke, completely-by-accident goal from 45 shots this season!
&gt; His average shot distance is 26 yards!
&gt; He has 0 assists in 10 games!
&gt; Get. The fuck. Out.
&gt; Townsend’s performance so far this season is exactly what Shakespeare was thinking of when he wrote, “Full of sound and fury. Signifying nothing.”

Townsend just isn't a quality player, not good enough for one of the wings in this team imo. He wasn't good last season and just because he's english he's getting hype. People on this board hailed him for being brave when trying his luck from distance or taken on defenders, but he just doesnt posses the skills to accomplish anything.

Just because poor people spend money doesn't mean it goes back to the government to help the nation's fiscal help. In the economic jargon, multipliers will be a lot less than one - particularly as the economy would have been at full output before 2007. 

While PFI amounts do have to be paid, future liabilities there are not included in the regular government accounts, because the payments are typically structured as rent for buildings. Tax revenue and tax rates both went up under Labour, and have gone up overall under the Coalition too.

Outsourcing costs will contribute to government spending of course, but so would in-house provision of government services. The difference between the two is likely to be small either way - it's the provision of the service at all that is the main cost. I'd have to completely disagree with you on HMRC, which is a famously wasteful department in the civil service. 

Tuition fees will genuinely add to the national debt at any point in time. However, it shouldn't add to the *deficit*, as repayments should balance lending out amounts.

If he was showing occasional moments of brilliance in the time he's player, i'd not write him off so quickly.

true,steefen7,null,null,"Wow what a piece of shit article. Claiming that Mourinho doesn't know how to manage players and makes them worse flies in the face of all the trophies he's won and the players who speak so highly of him wherever he goes.

The author's fixation on the Europa league is just silly and betrays the fact that *he* is probably the one holding a grudge. Chelsea played against weak opposition and never really blew them out of the water. The final against Benfica was another Chelsea moment of being outplayed yet finding a way to win. This doesn't make Rafa some sort of hero who created an invincible Chelsea team. He should be respected for his work, but there is no reason to revere him. 

While I also think that Mata should be starting, the parts on Oscar and on Schurrle was just plain incorrect and show the author is not watching as much Chelsea as he wants to imply. 

Oscar is not as creative as Mata and I think that shows, but he is calm and composed and plays some very good defense. Not to mention he can really shoot. 

Schurrle is played specifically to get wide and does this consistently when he is played. In fact, it'd be hard to watch him in a game and not realize that he was specifically trying to play as wide as possible when he brings the ball up the wing. 

Terrible, terrible writing by a complete jackoff. He doesn't like Chelsea so he made up some stuff pulled from half-read headlines to put us down. Shame on him and sorry for the lengthy post.

The idea of closing one of the busiest airports in the world, just after two brand new world leading terminals are built there is absolute nuts. 

The thing is, if you're going to build another runway at Heathrow, then it needs to be another two. Otherwise you simply delay the problem by another 20 years.

To give you an idea of the scale of the problem...

Most of the world's airports are near full at peak times, but traffic drops off over the day. If one aircraft is delayed, it can be fitted in later.

true,Schultzmeier1,null,null,"I think any one of those three would be great. We need a good link up striker to compliment our artistic style of play. A traditional striker will be frustrated in this team. With the talent we have in the mids our strikers goal to assist ratio should be nearly even, if not leaning to the assist side. I think Torres is coming into form and provides great link up play and is also putting in good work when he is on the pitch. He is become the model of striker that fits this system. I think a combination of Torres and one of any of those three strikers would be the ideal situation for our team. Obviously Lewa and Torres would be interchangeable and wouldn't see the pitch at the same time, but Rooney and Torres up front together would be interesting. 

F - Torres (hold up play, up front striker)
F- Rooney (free roam) - Eto'o could play this role in our current set. 
CM(possibly a little deeper than traditional CAM) - Oscar(Europe/PM creative teams)/Mata(Europe/PM creative teams)/Lamps(PM more physical hard nose teams) 
RM - Hazard/Oscar (tracking back could improve) 
LM - Shurrle/Willian (strong work rate) 
HM/CDM - Ramirez/Mikel (Holding)
RB - Ivan/Azpi
CB - CaHill/Luiz
CB - Terry

I really, really like Lallana a lot, he's one of my favorite players in the league that isn't on Liverpool.

true,SocraticDiscourse,null,null,"&gt; You included the costs of putting each of the people who would have rioted in prison, but didn't include the costs of putting anyone else in prison. To calculate the costs of that rule you can't just add up the costs of people who would have been involved in the London riots, you have to include the costs of every reoffender who gets imprisoned for longer.

A reasonable point, and obviously my numbers were back of the envelope stuff, but there was a huge saving from things like the London riots not happening - plus similar savings in all the other cities. Then, of course, there would be dramatic savings from the deterrent effect.

&gt; Plus, that £37k figure is the cost of keeping someone imprisoned. It doesn't factor in the cost of arresting them or the cost of the court procedures required to imprison them.

This is a silly point. Clearly any court proceedings needed to imprison them again are going to be a lot lower than the numerous court proceedings needed currently when they re-offend 15 times.

My understanding is that the main basis for the argument for breast milk is that these antibodies and hormones are delivered from mother to infant via breast milk and that by depriving an infant of breast milk these are not provided. The belief is that consequently this has an impact on the child's development and therefore future health. 

There is also an argument that the nutritional content of breast milk is superior, however I'd imagine this is harder to substantiate than the antibodies/hormones claims.

Needless to say that the early stages of development are rapid and are crucial for future health, so much so that even seemingly minor variables can have lasting impact throughout life.

true,Eddie_Hitler,cnty-uk,Scotsman in East Anglia,"It did actually occur to me the other day: if there had been no 1919 Treaty of Versailles, would there have been World War II?

Put simply the ToV *humiliated* Germany and trashed what was left of their economy, bleeding it dry through reparations etc.  It was this sense of resentment and desperation that helped fan the flames of the nationalism which, eventually, led to Hitler's election as Chancellor who successfully seized/merged the office of President when Von Hindenburg died in 1934.  Before that, the ""Enabling Act"" had been invoked following the Reichstag fire and this led to pretty much martial law.

Later in the 1930s Hitler was then able to carry out his Lebensraum policy, which led to the invasion of Poland which led to World War II.  This was a whopping **20** years after the last one.

Would any of this have happened if there was no Treaty of Versailles and everyone was just left alone to rebuild themselves?  If Germany hadn't been publicly humiliated and basically asset-stripped, there probably wouldn't have been the appetite or climate to elect someone like Hitler and his insane ideology... granted it got more insane as time went on and people who had voted for him felt shafted, but that's not the point here.

It would be like the UK suddenly turning around and voting for UKIP and Farage, because American and Chinese business quit London and the EU/UN told us to get rid of our military and hand our entire GDP over to the French.

Well, would there? How's that working out for the US? Biggest prison population in the world, and it doesn't seem to be helping their crime rate much. 

&gt;This is a silly point. Clearly any court proceedings needed to imprison them again are going to be a lot lower than the numerous court proceedings needed currently when they re-offend 15 times.

People are going to fight a lot harder in the prison system against being sent down for years for a minor crime than against light punishments.

I'm not ignoring it, but you haven't quantified it.

There are 145 Michelin starred restaurants in the UK, 38% of them are in London, 45% of two or three star restaurant are in London, and all three star restaurants in the UK are either in London or just outside in Bray.

Except for a few places in the south, London is the easiest place in the UK to go to Paris from (cue ""best thing about London is leaving it"" jokes). Not to mention that London airports probably offer more destinations than any other city in the World.

Some musicals might do UK tours every now and then, but all of them will be on at the West End. Same thing for band tours: most of them will stop in a second UK city but all of them will stop in London. For example, Roger Waters' The Wall Live tour has performed twelve times in the UK, seven of those times have been in London.

There are six Premier League clubs in London, just as many as the entire North.

In terms of architecture, other UK cities might compare in specific examples but overall nowhere else has as broad a spectrum. The City is a beautiful sight at night.

true,SocraticDiscourse,null,null,"&gt; Well, would there? How's that working out for the US? Biggest prison population in the world, and it doesn't seem to be helping their crime rate much.

This is a really bad argument. They send more people to grad school, how's that working out for them in terms of crime rates? Correlation does not equal causation, particularly when it's a datapoint of *one freaking country*. There are a lot of far more relevant things behind their crime rates, notably they have a lot less police officers on the street, and have seventh of their population that was legally discriminated against just fifty years ago.


&gt; People are going to fight a lot harder in the prison system against being sent down for years for a minor crime than against light punishments.

People generally fight as much as they can anyway. Plus it would be *one* appeal versus *fifteen* prosecutions for different crimes.

&gt; I'm not ignoring it, but you haven't quantified it.

What quantification in monetary terms would you put on someone being raped? 

&gt; I'm of the opinion that everyone should have human rights, even people who have committed crimes in their past, and that sending someone down for years for a minor crime is barbaric, and a symptom of a government leaning too close to autocracy.

I'm also of the opinion that everyone should have human rights. However, I do not believe it is a breach of human rights to sentence someone for a long prison sentence for breaking the law. Nor does the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I do know, however, that having your home broken into, your property stolen, being physically or sexually assaulted is having your human rights being breached under the UDHR, however, so I'd like to minimise that. I find it amazing that people put the debatable (to put it mildly) human rights abrogation of one criminal over the clear human rights abrogations of dozens of likely victims.",0,1384293425,null,0,false,0,cdcud7c,t3_1qg191,t1_cdcud7c,t1_cdct5ug,null,1428685996,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Regarding the Europa title, there was no need for him to belittle it. Chelsea was pretty much knocked out of the UCL, what was Rafa suppose to do? Just give up because ""Chelsea is bigger than that""? It was not necessary for him to comment on something his current players were genuinely proud of.

I've stated that I would preferred Oscar over Mata since last summer. While I am not changing my opinion, Chelseas inability to break down teams when they load the box is troubling. While I am positive that the constant inclusion of Frank Lampard in the starting XI has something to do with it, I would like to see Mata be given more opportunity at his natural position as a #10. 

We all know about the Joe Cole/Mourinho story already. Another one is Mikel. But, as far as Robben goes, I'm not sure what point he was trying to make. Robbens position was never changed.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"Exactly. As much of a giggle we can all have about this it doesn't weaken what he's saying depending on where he's saying it. The thing I think we should all focus on is that the last few years have shown that what he is saying is demonstrably wrong. Austerity may be lowering the deficit but it has absolutely not lowered the cost of living and none of the savings have in anyway benefited the general public. Yes, it will make the economy more streamlined but you streamline things by cutting out inefficiencies. Unfortunately society is necessarily a bell curve and cutting off inefficiencies when running a country means failing to support to bottom couple of % of people. If David Cameron thinks that's a good way to run the country he is incredibly irresponsible and callous. 

I don't actually think he does think that however; he just has been forced to think of the economy in terms of the bigger picture and as numbers not people and now he is not thinking within reality. He, or in reality George Osborne who is responsible for most of what he is saying after all, needs a reality check but I don't see that coming soon. Who would give it? 

It's fascinating to watch them bumble along talking about tightening the purse and how this benefiting everyone and just watching them look around clearly blissfully unaware that nothing they are doing is benefiting anyone but a few particular businesses, the same businesses containing 'experts' who tell them how the economy is doing. They have done and continue to do nothing to help anyone with any of their myriad financial problems. For a government that has had so many ideas and wanted to change so much, their total ineffectiveness and inability to actually do literally anything helpful is staggering.

true,count_toastcula,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt;This is a really bad argument. They send more people to grad school, how's that working out for them in terms of crime rates? Correlation does not equal causation, particularly when it's a datapoint of one freaking country. There are a lot of far more relevant things behind their crime rates, notably they have a lot less police officers on the street, and have seventh of their population that was legally discriminated against just fifty years ago.

When you're working with countries, what do you have to go on but other countries? Scandinavia hands out less harsh criminal punishments and has lower crime rates. It's not perfect but it's better than the sum total of zero evidence you have supplied that increasing criminal sentences is an effective and cost-efficient way of preventing crime.

&gt;People generally fight as much as they can anyway. Plus it would be one appeal versus fifteen prosecutions for different crimes.

You're telling me you'd be as likely to oppose 20 days of community service as you would be to oppose a 3 year prison sentence?

&gt;What quantification in monetary terms would you put on someone being raped?

What quantification in monetary terms would you put on someone being raped in prison because it seemed fair to put them away for 3 years for stealing a pizza? 

&gt;I'm also of the opinion that everyone should have human rights. However, I do not believe it is a breach of human rights to sentence someone for a long prison sentence for breaking the law. Nor does the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

I believe it to be a breach of human rights to sentence someone to several years in prison for a minor crime.

&gt;I do know, however, that having your home broken into, your property stolen, being physically or sexually assaulted is having your human rights being breached under the UDHR, however, so I'd like to minimise that. I find it amazing that people put the debatable (to put it mildly) human rights abrogation of one criminal over the clear human rights abrogations of **dozens of likely victims**.

So why stop there? Why not lock anyone up forever who so much as littered? If we can get 20% of the population into prisons, we'll surely drop crime by at least 20%.

He's a crafty mother fucker who tried to play chicken with us, lost and now is trying to win back fans that turned on him, come summer it'll be the same thing but with a bigger price tag.

* Sturridge is an outstanding player, but he *IS* greedy.. not as greedy as he used to be at Chelsea (and we know why he had to be) but he still tries to be the hero from time to time and the only player that calls him out on it is Suarez..although I have no problem with Suarez doing it because he truly is a killer that can make things happen from anywhere.

Scandinavia hands out less harsh criminal punishments and has lower crime rates. It's not perfect but it's better than the sum total of zero evidence you have supplied that increasing criminal sentences is an effective and cost-efficient way of preventing crime.

I've provided far more links and evidence to this conversation than you have. But let's go on your basis: China and Singapore have longer prison sentences and very low crime rates.

&gt; You're telling me you'd be as likely to oppose 20 days of community service as you would be to oppose a 3 year prison sentence?

Clearly you're picking an extreme case here. Most of the cases I'm talking about are instances of repeated burglary, theft, assault or sexual offences. Those would be at least a year in prison in most cases. Generally if it's a year in prison people appeal as much as they're allowed. And you did not address my point that these are people that, on average, did FIFTEEN previous offences. How many appeals do you think these guys could potentially get? 

&gt; What quantification in monetary terms would you put on someone being raped in prison because it seemed fair to put them away for 3 years for stealing a pizza?

Prison rape is virtually unheard of in the UK. I've found one article on an individual case and that's it... It would seem like you're grasping at straws here. Clearly any increase would be tiny relative to the number of rapes you would stop.

&gt; So why stop there? Why not lock anyone up forever who so much as littered? If we can get 20% of the population into prisons, we'll surely drop crime by at least 20%.

Because the social and financial cost of littering is relatively minor, and would not be worth the cost. We need to be sensible here and differentiate minor crimes (""misdemeanours in US speak"") with serious ones (""felonies"").

People say it's too early to judge, but we're over 25% of the way through the season, we've play 2 of last year's top 4 and picked up 3 points, and only lost 2 games (one being to the current leaders).

We're 2 points behind 1st. We've been playing some of the best football (I'll give Arsenal *the* best football title) in the league, and relatively consistently. We haven't fielded a full strength side yet (No Suarez for first 5, then no Coutinho, now no Enrique and he is evidently a lot better than Cissokho) and yet we have annihilated good teams like West Brom (who very nearly beat Chelsea) and Man U.

I think we look like a top 4 side and are playing as such. The 2 games we've lost are to teams in the top 4, which I can accept, and while the Southampton game was disappointing, you have to admit that they've been playing phenomenally. 

Equally our rivals have been pretty bad. Chelsea have been shaky and inconsistent. Tottenham have been awful. Man U are only just starting to look like a team who even have a remote chance of Europe next season, and City are equally inconsistent.

true,count_toastcula,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt;I've provided far more links and evidence to this conversation than you have. 

You provided links to two facts which weren't even being debated. You provided nothing to show harsher sentences are an effective deterrent or are cost-effective.

&gt;But let's go on your basis: China and Singapore have longer prison sentences and very low crime rates.

Singapore doesn't have juries and imprisons people for littering, and China is an oppressive dictatorship. Neither are systems I'd like us to emulate. We're much more similar to the US.

Clearly you're picking an extreme case here. Most of the cases I'm talking about are instances of repeated burglary, theft, assault or sexual offences. Those would be at least a year in prison in most cases.

You haven't actually shown this, you've just claimed it.

&gt;Prison rape is virtually unheard of in the UK. I've found one article on an individual case and that's it... It would seem like you're grasping at straws here. Clearly any increase would be tiny relative to the number of rapes you would stop.

Again, you haven't shown this at all, you've just claimed it. Prison rape is rare in the UK, but you haven't given any indication of how many rapes would be prevented by imposing harsher sentences on every repeat offender in the UK.

&gt;Because the social and financial cost of littering is relatively minor, and would not be worth the cost.

You haven't shown that any of it is worth the cost.

&gt;We need to be sensible here and differentiate minor crimes (""misdemeanours in US speak"") with serious ones (""felonies"").

I agree. We should also sentence accordingly.

I think the sign of a good attacking full back is someone who you are confident is looking for a player (or even an area) when crossing/passing the ball into the box. I don't think Cissokho does that, he just sort of hits and hopes. I feel you need a bit more confidence in that area to be considered a great full back (think Baines).

When it comes to slowing the pace down, I just think a ""better"" attacking left back makes much more use of the acres of space he has seen himself find over the games he has been involved in.  So often you see the space open up in front of him, and a poor touch, or dawdling on the ball results in opportunities lost. The contrast between him and Johnson is easily noticeable.

You are aware that two of the ""London"" airports aren't even within the boundaries of the M25? Its like saying I live in Lincolnshire because its an hours drive away.

3 out of 8 Michelin 3 star restaurants are outside of the M25. Bray is next to Maidenhead. Reading is even further away - hardly ""London"".

What the fuck is it about London where something that isn't in London is claimed as being purely on the basis that its within an hours travel? Its as stupid as Liverpudlians claiming Old Trafford is in Liverpool because its 30 miles down the road.

true,TheQuestionaut,null,null,"* * * *Spoilers, I guess * * *

I'm gonna run with Capaldi as my 12, and here is why: the men exudes calculated menace.

My take would be:

**Early:** The Doctor escaping from the events of the 50th, and in his sheer exuberance going on a few 11-like adventures. One or two simple adventures, just for the character to fill his own skin. The recurring theme of these will be his inability to make it there in time. He'd maybe save the day a few times, but not without losses. Pyrrhic victories. The Doctor stands at the machine he's just managed to stop/use to save the world...and looks around him: ashes. Ashes. The Time Lord ran out of time/was too late. I want him stuck to deal with the aftermath, no running off as per usual this time, not this time...please no, he can't be here...h-he needs to get away.

The bags under Capaldi's eyes, the thousand yard stare, the Malcolm Tucker fury in his snarl. *The darkness sets in*.

**Mid:** The Doctor is convinced he can *cure* the universe, so he starts tinkering with each and every little thing, finding threats before they emerge and utterly destroying them. Not with force, but with calculated dismantling. At one point he's confronted by Clara: ""Doctor, please, what crime have they committed!?"". 

12: ""I have seen what they do!!!! What they become!! I have seen the widows they leave, the poisoned earth, the scorched skies. I have seen world's blink out existence at their hand!""

""Then make them better...that's what a doctor does isn't it? He makes them better.""

12: ""I AM MAKING IT BETTER. I am making everything better.""

The Doctor goes too far one time. Just one time. And that's all it really takes. *The sadness and darkness descend on his soul*

**Late:** The Doctor is depressed. A lot of people will agree that the show handled depression very respectfully in ""Vincent and The Doctor"" and I'd like to see it shown in The Doctor. Even the greatest of us are fallible. Heavy is the head that wears the crown...and all of time and space can be a burden and a curse as much as a gift.

I'd see the Doctor becoming distant, pushing away, and Clara (and 1 or 2 other main companions) trying to help him and just not knowing what to do. How do you help a living millennium? Where can you even start!?

Things progress with the Doctor so distant that he eventually is stuck in a situation where he can either save everyone, or save Clara from the enemy (Daleks, Cybermen, etc: an old and powerful foe that is considered an ultimate threat). Usually we'd see him insist on doing both, and by goodness he'd make it happen. Not any more. All of the emotional baggage, everything, 900+ years of loss and pain. He no longer cares. 

He chooses to let Clara die, in order to save everyone. She whispers her goodbye: (Along the lines of) ""I'm so sorry, I love you...I forgive you"". He watches her die because of him. He wins. He...wins...

The Doctor kills himself. The depression, everything, it builds to the point where he can't take it any more and distraught at losing Clara he snaps back from his self-imposed distance from everything and does it.

** *Ok, maybe not kill himself...because it kinda is still a family show, and I don't want to send the wrong message to people who do suffer through emotional troubles* **


END OF 12.



That would be my take. 13 would be anything but unlucky. 13 would see the Doctor seeking help, coming to terms, and generally being...happy. A family maybe.

I just really want to see the show take a dark turn...and not pull their punches. The Vincent van Gogh episode was so moving, so powerful. Doctor Who is the perfect show to tackle these sorts of things.

And ultimately, I want the show to end up in a happier place. The best way to show that is to have it go dark first.

TL;DR: The Time Lord is late/runs out of time to save everyone --&gt; The Doctor tries to cure everyone --&gt; The Doctor needs help/a doctor. Overall a dark tone",0,1384298741,null,0,false,0,cdcwqzq,t3_1qhkzy,t1_cdcwqzq,t3_1qhkzy,null,1428684884,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

If the staff won’t help then ask to see the store manager, and if they won’t help, ask for their head office contact details and/or complaints process. Make sure you take names. Also don’t forget that social media is an amazingly powerful tool these days - if anyone complains to us on Facebook/Twitter we bend over backwards for them, so use that to your advantage (although I’ve been told that PC World/Knowhow are not very good at the whole social media thing).

I definitely think you’re more likely to get a positive outcome from dealing with HP rather than PC World as you have a warranty with HP, whereas PC World have your money and thus no incentive to help you. Try contacting HP over Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/HPUK, or you could try the contact details at http://www8.hp.com/uk/en/contact-hp/contact.html. Still, this is just my opinion based off of the dealings I have with retailers. You may as well contact HP as you have nothing to lose.

In the meantime, the best thing you can do with your laptop is use it in ‘economy’ or ‘power saving’ mode as this often caps the processer at a lower clock speed (hopefully reducing heat). You can also try using a can of compressed air on the air vent, in case this is clogged up with dust. To be honest, the most common cause of overheating is either crap thermal paste, or a lack of paste, which is easy enough to fix but if you’re in warranty you’ll definitely want HP or PC World to do it for you.

For instance [Free Dictionary](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/fascistic) lists fascism as;

&gt;fas·cism  (fshzm)

&gt;1 often Fascism
a. A system of government marked by centralization of authority under a dictator, stringent socioeconomic controls, suppression of the opposition through terror and censorship, and typically a policy of belligerent nationalism and racism.

&gt;b. A political philosophy or movement based on or advocating such a system of government.

&gt;**2 Oppressive, dictatorial control.**

In the [OED](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/fascism?q=fascistic#fascism__6)

&gt;noun
[mass noun]

&gt;an authoritarian and nationalistic right-wing system of government and social organization. **(in general use) extreme right-wing, authoritarian, or intolerant views or practices: this is yet another example of health fascism in action**

&gt;The term Fascism was first used of the totalitarian right-wing nationalist regime of Mussolini in Italy (1922–43); the regimes of the Nazis in Germany and Franco in Spain were also Fascist. Fascism tends to include a belief in the supremacy of one national or ethnic group, a contempt for democracy, an insistence on obedience to a powerful leader, and a strong demagogic approach",0,1384300595,null,0,false,0,cdcxjih,t3_1qgm5m,t1_cdcxjih,t1_cdcxaa0,null,1428684514,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

That being said the whole narrative about only the north having faced this phenomenon isn't by any means the whole picture, and in a sense the North-South divide doesn't exist in the way that people thinks it does. There are area divides most certainly, and there are *more* of the affluent areas in the south for sure, but it isn't close to an even distribution of money or government attention. For example in areas around this airport development alone Ramsgate and Margate both have child poverty figures of 44% and 45%, Gillingham 39% and Chatham 35%- this compares badly with the worst areas of Hull at 33%, and only Manchester Central comes out worse, with nearly 50%. The schools in the area also fall below 90+% of the country, with schools like the Ramsgate School getting 4% of students to pass 5 GCSE's. Much of Essex doesn't do much better, with areas such as Jaywick, Tendring, Grays and Tilbury amongst the most deprived areas in the UK.

I remember visiting a uni friend from Dewsbury, and they spent the week before I visited repeatedly warning me about how shit it was and awful and how I would never have seen anything like it. Now it really was a shithole, no offence to Dewsbury folk, but it certainly wasn't any worse than places in the south I've stayed in or worked in like Luton, dartford, Sheppey, Ilford, or Slough. But in the south you'll also have a St Albans, Cambridge or Sevenoaks, and probably much nearer to the shitholes. Even inside one local authority you'll see a huge wealth gap in perhaps a slightly different way then you will in the north, although that being said the gap between places like Liverpool and the Wirral must be bewildering. 

But yeah, don't forget places like Chatham had it's entire industry and economy taken out by the Dockyard's closure in the 80's, or Thanet losing it's shipping industry, its coal mines and its US/UK Airforce Base in about 15 years, and government largely ignored it until they could wallop a super-airport on top of them.

true,So1ar,lfc55,,"Well, there are several reasons but quite simply we need the revenue of tickets a new stadium could provide. Manchester United, for example, have a 75,000 seat stadium with plans to expand that even more. We really need the revenue to compete with them and Arsenal (whose new stadium seats up to 70,000). 

Anfield is located in the middle of a neighborhood so expanding it requires [several people to sell their homes](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/10383740/Liverpools-Anfield-redevelopment-plans-hit-an-impasse-over-six-neighbouring-properties.html) and relocate. There simply isn't enough room to expand without knocking down their homes. And since you've never been there(not insulting you by any means. it's very difficult to travel there from overseas.) I can assure you it feels and looks like it was built in the early 1900's. Also, some of the seats are made out of wood. Getting splinters in your ass is not a pleasant experience. Iconic as it is, compared to the new stadiums being built, it really falls short. And by that I mean the facilities, location, and seating (not the atmosphere). 

The funding required to expand Anfield to 60,000 (that's roughly 15,000 more than it currently holds) just isn't worth it in the long run. Which (in my opinion) is why there has been nothing but silence in terms of expansion. The owners don't want to fund a new stadium (which is why they desperately searched for a partner to name the new stadium) and know financially buying all the homes of the people who live around Anfield and the money it would take to add on is not worth it in the long run.

Yes, Anfield is one of the most iconic grounds in football. But we can't value our past more than our future. And that is why I feel we need a new stadium. It's the people and current players who make the stadium's feared. Not the ghosts of the past.

With just 29 MPs coming from smaller parties, that therefore means that at least 34 Labour ones didn’t turn up – and in reality at least 43, since we know that all six SNP MPs, two Plaid Cymru and one Green voted with the motion.

But reading some of yours it seems a lot of them are standard...

*- Suarez will go next summer.*

Of course he will. Unless he signs a new one, with only two years left on his contract. in order to get the maximum for him it makes financial sense to sell him next summer

*- Henderson is overrated.*

He puts in a good shift, but his passing and shooting are more often than not fairly average.

*- Suso will be better than Coutinho (he won't).*

They're roughly the same age. Suso is yet to have a single game for Liverpool where's he contributed as much as Coutinho. I'd love to be wrong and for him to return a potential world beater, but I don't think he's got the same level of footballing intelligence as Coutinho. He's looking good in a league full of light weights where you're given more time on the ball, but I think he'll struggle when under pressure.

*- Gerrard needs to be rested for certain games.*

He's getting old and tends to tire early and leave huge gaps in midfield. It's either this or take him off after 60.

*- Enrique is a liability.*

You heard it from Carra's own mouth.

*- Kelly and Wisdom aren't good enough.*

The NHS got £500m more this year than they did last year. So when you consider inflation and increasing population, that's pretty much a freeze. Certainly not an enormous gaping deficit that would be responsible for such a huge shortage.

That 20,000 number seems to be pulled out of nowhere. From the article it's pretty shady the way they calculated it and clearly the Royal College of Nurses is going to want more nurses and more money to pay for them. If the NHS is letting people retire and not replacing them, what's so inherently bad about that if it all still functions? It's pretty vague to say that a larger percentage of ""nursing vacancies"" is the same as a shortage.

&gt;Vacancy rates are determined by the difference between the number of nurses that hospital managers estimate they need and the number that they actually have. 

That's a pretty dodgy way to calculate it. Of course hospital managers are going to overestimate numbers. If I learned anything from the public sector it's that you always, always ask for more money and always spend everything you get, just in case you don't get more.

Surely the quality of care is more important than the number of people employed in a particular role? I don't care about the number of nurses or doctors in the NHS.

The Doctor, to me, is this fantastical being that takes people from their ordinary lives and makes them into something extraordinary.  He sees everyone's potential to do something great with their lives and he shows them a part of themselves that they did not think ever existed.

The policy was initially brought in through the NUS (Guild Council voted to align Guild policy with NUS policy unless otherwise voted by council). Three years' worth of officer teams, specifically the welfare officer, have worked on it, which involved consulting the liberation officers and associations. The policy was then passed at Guild Council with 92% of the vote.

She has indeed sacrificed much of her life to the service of her subjects and as monarchs go, achieved a great deal. It's appropriate to retain the formality as reflective of this. She has not led a normal life.

Of course, in less formal circumstances the queen will be referred to as Mam (pronounced ""marm"" as in harm not ""mam"" as in ham). Often by her palace staff. To the prince of wales she's mother. Princes William and Harry, Grandmamma.

With regard to your comments about the PM: Constitutional Monarchistic Convention states that the prime minister is *invited* by the Queen to form a government. To rule for *her*. Generally he'll be addressed as the PM or Prime Minister. Other times, Mr. Cameron. He is, as you say, doing a job from which he can certainly be fired.

[Coutinho highlights from scout nation for reference](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl5n3X14-cQ)

----------------------------------

First off, the future of this club is Coutinho and Suso in the middle with Ibe and Sterling on the wings...and it will be beautiful 

Secondly, anybody who has sat down and really looked at both players will see how *RIDICULOUSLY* similar Coutinho and Suso actually play to one another... (practically the same person)

I'll narrow it down as bluntly as I can to just saying that Coutinho is a pass master, he's the tactician, the thinker.. he can play a ball through more accurately than an army sniper. Suso is a lion, he's a lead by example, he who dares wins.. although his passing and vision is exceptional its his dribbling and drive that tops it for me, watching him is pretty reminiscent of watching suarez, although he lack the scoring ability (for now) the kid will carry and dribble the ball through teams like they were nothing and open them apart (his performance against Barcelona was exceptional).

It's a bit of a long call to make because when Coutinho finds his scoring legs they'll be no stopping him but the same goes for Suso, while coutinho has arguably better passing and vision when suso goes on a run there's very little chance of getting that ball off him.

lets hope they both turn out to be all they can be!

Gerrard LOVES Sterling.. loves him to the death and the hype surrounding him is very very real. Nothing i say can do him justice other than by assuring everyone that he is the real deal ",0,1384311004,null,0,false,0,cdd1y08,t3_1qhhnh,t1_cdd1y08,t1_cdcxr7r,null,1428682394,15,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,15

Bring back two parter episodes, I really missed them the last season. The Name of the Doctor really could have done with one.

**Enemies: **
Another focus for the show would be on new enemies, after all we've just had the 50th that celebrated all the big old ones. Why not create some new ones or really lesser known enemies, some of which I'd love to see again especially the Celestial Toymaker. 

**Doctor:**
I don't know what actor would be best for this, Capaldi is a great fit as a Doctor and I would have probably chosen someone 'old'/older than what we've had with Tennant and Smith. Maybe Martin Clunes, odd choice I know but I think he might be able to pull a corker of annoyed angry at the world/universe Doctor. 
Bonus: Benedict Cumberbatch as the Master, would make a nice change as they've always been played by actors about the same age and I think would give the Master another little thing to gloat about.

A bit more no nonsense by the numbers Doctor, he's willing to talk down to Humans again, his anger and darkness from his past lives taking over slightly from time to time with non of them listening to him. This could result in one of them finally dying again, in his arms, rather than moving on or leaving in some fashion.
The darkness could lead into a story that times back into the 6th Doctor. 

Before finally getting fed up of Fighting, he's old he's fought for far too long and just wants to rest and not always be the one to always save the day.

**Over arcing plot: **
1st Season - I'll probably make sure that this hits hard and hits home this could be the Doctor's last outing at any moment, although obviously won't be. To do this we will have the Doctor being a bit more cryptic than ever before but when asked straight up, maybe as the the result of in a quiet place/locked up so they all have plenty of time to think. The Doctor explains to Clara and maybe another companion (This time an Alien-humoniod... maybe actually Alien looking for once?) That when a Time Lord uses up all 12 of their regenerations, they disappear as if they never existed. Of course this will before The Doctor's figured out a plan to escape.

This would be spaced out over the season along with Cameo's of Ghost River speaking to the Doctor, both of them finding it hard to let go. She has something she wants to say to him but can never seem to get the words out and it doesn't help he tries to ignore her, wanting to forget because even for his new heart, its too much to bare.

And this next part might be a bit cheesey but I thought it might be an interesting idea off the top of my head. With his pain of losing someone he loved, maybe even a death of a companion again, and his annoyance growing from past adventures a Darkness takes over him and he begins to call himself the Valeyard. He then rushes off into the Tardis and someone gets back in time to the Trial. However an old ally appears, the White Guardian, bring the Valeyard back after a chase in space and time, he frees the Doctor where it's revealed that the Valeyard was the Black Guardian who corrupted and since taken the form of the Doctor. Not sure how I'd end this really. Maybe with the Valeyard/BG escaping or imprisonment. 

**2nd/3rd Season** - This would be an eventual pay off in the second season, where the Doctor tends to throw himself into Danger, a lot more than usual until finally after another season and towards the 12 episode of the season as and maybe failing to save the universe or save it in one last sacrifice. 
The Doctor begins to embrace death, almost welcoming it. He's lived too long after all. The Doctor lays down to die and disappear, but suddenly The Doctor begins to fill with a yellow light, feeling invigorated with energy or maybe the light begins to make the Doctor float. He's begun to regenerate more violently than ever before, he warns his companions to get back and yells with his last words ""This shouldn't be possible, this is impossible.""

Explosions, maybe in some kind of cave network causing parts to collapse and the companions to run out. After fleeing and seeing the cave collapse they turn to see a new Doctor walk through the smoke, as a woman and she says ""I'm the Doctor"" before ending revealing a 13th episode the following week. (No mention that there would be a 13th episode or another Doctor, maybe saying it's the end?)
In that Episode Ghost River and the Doctor explain that she received more regenerations from River when she poisoned her...him in a previous incarnation and used her regenerations to revive her...him. 

**TL;DR:** Two Part episodes. Martin Clunes as a Dark/Old/Angry Doctor. Call backs to older lesser known enemies and new ones. Actual Alien looking companions and those from different time periods. Explanation of this being The Last Doctor for a few seasons, regenerates into a woman is explained in a secret episode as to have been given River's regenerations in ""Let's Kill Hitler.""

This e-petition has received the following response:
As this e-petition has received more than 10 000 signatures, the relevant Government department have provided the following response:

In his speech on the 22 July[1], the Prime Minister announced a set of new measures for the internet industries to help parents keep their children safe online.

From the end of this year, when new customers set up a broadband account, they will be prompted to set up parental controls. If a customer repeatedly clicks ‘yes’ to get through the set-up quickly, filters will be automatically selected. Parental controls are easy for the account holder to change, so customers who do not want filters can simply switch them off. In addition, parents will have the option to customise filters, so that only the categories of content that they choose will be filtered out in their household.

The Government is aware of concerns that filters may lead to over-blocking. A UK Council for Child Internet Safety working group will look at this issue specifically and will report back to the Ministerial chairs. If a consumer or a website owner feels that a site has been wrongly or unfairly blocked, they can seek redress directly with the relevant internet service provider (ISP).

ISPs have contracts with their customers which include good practice Acceptable Use Policies (AUPs) about what may be hosted on their servers. Most AUPs already contain a general clause which allows them to remove sites or content which contain inappropriate or offensive material, even if it is not illegal.

The Government expects these sites to respond to complaints quickly and effectively as it is they who are best placed to deal with these issues. In the UK, we support a self-regulatory model for the internet industry as legislation can rarely adapt and change quickly enough to respond to the constantly evolving online environment.

It is important to note that in an open society like ours, it is necessary to find the right balance between protecting the public and legitimate freedom of speech. The Government will continue to work with ISPs and the rest of the internet industry to help people enjoy the benefits of the internet safely.

All releases are delayed arbitrarily by months (Sometimes you can get DVD or BlueRay rips online before it's in theatres here), legitimate content is often more expensive here than in North America and we're on the border of two regions, causing non-pirated movies/video games to arbitrarily not work depending on what you put them in.

I think there are a handful of universities that really do make a difference (Oxbridge and the like) but often I don't think the rest really make a huge difference in terms of how it's seen. I would suggest looking at things like the employment rate following your course, and the facilities for your specific course rather than going by overall reputation. Compare the facilities of some of your preferred English universities and see if you feel that the extra cost is justified for you.

Also, I don't think ALL universities in the UK are £9k/year - there are some that are cheaper. I think the ones charging £9k/year also have to offer additional bursaries and things for low-income families, so check if any of that might apply for you. There's also living costs to look at - chances are you'd be taking the full (~£5k-£9k/year depending on income/area, is it?) maintenance loan too if you went to an English university.

My degree was basically free with the Open University and doesn't seem to have held me back so far, heh.

Oh, keep in mind too...if you leave with £40k in student loans and no job prospects then chances are you'll barely pay anything off anyway. Don't forget that you'll only start paying it back on a £21,000 salary and then it starts at something ridiculous like £5/month. I pay £25 a month, it's just...insignificant.

Hell when I was growing up in the 70s and a teen through most of the 80s, there was an unwritten code. You show some damn respect for your elders (whether they were your betters or not), you didn't shit in your own backyard, and you behaved. How simple was that?

Yeah, we got into scrapes, even had the odd run-in with the police after one drunken evening meant we were apparently ""being too loud"" in the local bus shelter (our hang-out of choice in a shitty little village with nothing else to do).

But the police themselves knew the unwritten code ... a quiet word to ""calm down boys"" was all that was required, and we calmed the fuck down. We showed them respect, didn't try to throw fucking rocks at them or lynch them, or accuse them of ""invading our right to free speech"", and they didn't drag us down the cells or serve us with an ASBO for possessing 4 cans of cider when we were quite obviously underage.

But then it all went wrong. The ""progressive"" (sic) Left told parents they couldn't discipline their own kids in their own home, told teachers that they couldn't discipline kids under their care in schools, and the kids starting suing the parents every time they got a clip round the ear for being a bad little bastard.

What else could fucking happen? The kids ran wild, no more barriers, no more rules, Fuck Da Police etc etc etc ... Respect went out the window, and 2 or 3 generations later we have Chav girls beating up elderly men on the pavement while people watch, and looters and rioters validated by idiot social workers with nothing better to do (anyone remember the free trip to Africa if you stole enough cars?).

Sorry but the FBI doesn't follow UK law and juries don't decide the legality of items. There are defined categories for images which the IWF are trained to follow.

&gt; The incompetency with which they operated in that single incident shows they shouldn't be so blindly trusted. They blocked a URL to the 6th most visited website in the world without comment or contact, in a way which proxied every connection from the UK to Wikipedia, causing enormous technical fallout.

The problem being that they don't block anything. They provide a list. ISPs choose how to implement blocking. This wikipedia incident happened 5 years ago and no doubt provided a learning experience to both the IWF and the ISPs who do the blocking.

Job based in aberdeen with an oil well digging consulting company from what I understand. He pulled in about £105k last year I think. You get paid a lot (like £400-600 a day or something) for those days off shore and from what I understand you can do a lot of them with only a certain number of days back on shore.

My bad, I don't know why I thought you said software engineering. Looks like I did the wrong degree!

&gt;And yeah, ministers earn even more but they also have much more responsibility. And during recess, MPs are still pretty busy doing things in their constituencies. And ok, maybe it's hard to get actually fired, but you are under public scrutiny, media scrutiny and when you fuck up it gets massively publicised (rightly so).

Well they can't get fired at all. They can can get kicked out of their party, but they remain an MP until they resign or until the next election. They can even go to prison for a short period and remain an MP. If we had a right of recall, then maybe their pay would be more justified, since they could then be ""fired"" by their constituents forcing a bi-election.

&gt;In comparison to other countries, UK MPs are pretty averagely paid: http://www.theguardian.com/politics/datablog/2013/jul/11/mps-pay-uk-foreign-compared

Yeah I've heard this before. It would be interesting to see how satisfied people are with politics compared to how their MPs get paid. I'll bet the Australians don't get MPs that are twice as good because they get paid twice as much, and on the other hand I don't think Sweden or France's MPs will be worse because they get paid less. IMO, becoming an MP should be mostly about public service, they should get paid a decent wage but I don't think paying them more makes them better, I think we could pay them less and not get a lower quality of MP. Also, their wages only tell part of the story, we also give out MPs very generous expenses. 

&gt;It's just such a non-issue in the real world, it's silly when people get mad about MP salaries. I bet the budget for local council tea and biscuits is bigger than the total of parliamentary salaries.

I agree as a percentage of overall spending it is tiny. Still, as an issue it's not going to go away because it shows them as out of touch hypocrites. When start giving people advice to wear a jumper to stay warm rather than turn on the heating, when at the same time they don't even pay for their own heating out of their large wages but claim expenses instead (and of course in one case that included heating their stables), or when they say the public sector needs to be cut when they are the one area where they are getting pay rises, people are going to pick them up on it.

The major issue is the lack of quality to compete against the upper half of the table who have all a better midfield than we do.

That said, your degree is most relevant for your first one or two jobs after university, and people quickly stop caring as you gain actual work experience, so don't feel like you have to stress too much about it.

If you're eligible for student loans (as long as you're a UK resident you should be fine iirc), the money is not that big a deal.

You pay it back according to your income (at 18k, I was paying £22/month, at £20k it went up to about £100), and the interest rates are about the best you can get for a loan anyway.

Parental controls are easy for the account holder to change, so customers who do not want filters can simply switch them off. In addition, parents will have the option to customise filters, so that only the categories of content that they choose will be filtered out in their household.

Translation:  We know you proles are lazy and can't read what's on screen.  If you want to change it you're going to have to explain to the Indian call centre, who don't necessarily understand what's happening, that ""Yes, I want some pornographgy please""... dirty little proles that you are, looking for porn in a ""child friendly zone"" instead of hiring a £1000 a night escort and doing coke off her boobs.  If you can't face the walk of shame you can protect your child be selecting or deselecting which of the overbroad categories you'd like us to notice you don't want filtered; this may or may not actually do anything. 

&gt; The Government is aware of concerns that filters may lead to over-blocking.

Translation:  We've heard your pitiful mewling from our mansions. 

&gt; A UK Council for Child Internet Safety working group will look at this issue specifically and will report back to the Ministerial chairs. If a consumer or a website owner feels that a site has been wrongly or unfairly blocked, they can seek redress directly with the relevant internet service provider (ISP).

Translation:  But fuck you, we're going to stuff an organisation with some of our chums, who think a computer is still a person's job title and they'll send us funny reports about how much we're annoying you.  If you don't like it you are free to complain to the ISP's who are powerless to change anything. 

&gt;ISPs have contracts with their customers which include good practice Acceptable Use Policies (AUPs) about what may be hosted on their servers. Most AUPs already contain a general clause which allows them to remove sites or content which contain inappropriate or offensive material, even if it is not illegal.

Translation:  We have no idea what these words mean ""Contract"" and ""Laws"" and we also don't know how the Internet works, don't bother trying to explain it we're far to important for you to speak too.  As far as we're concerned your ISP hosts every website ever everywhere and that is different to other ISP's Internet, so we're going to nail Virgin Media to a wall about 4chan. 

&gt; The Government expects these sites to respond to complaints quickly and effectively as it is they who are best placed to deal with these issues. In the UK, we support a self-regulatory model for the internet industry as legislation can rarely adapt and change quickly enough to respond to the constantly evolving online environment.

Translation:  See, we're being nice!  The websites hosted on your ISP's internet can make the same mewling noises you do as well!  We're going to ignore it though and instead the ISP can listen to the whining even though they can't change a damn thing.

&gt;t is important to note that in an open society like ours, it is necessary to find the right balance between protecting the public and legitimate freedom of speech. The Government will continue to work with ISPs and the rest of the internet industry to help people enjoy the benefits of the internet safely.

Translation:  We've had some pled type this out (hello!) How DARE you attempt to influence your betters by using this site to complain about OUR policy.  Pray proles, pray we don't change the deal more.

Sometimes, if the purchasing system is too slow to act or down for one of a multitude of reasons, and you happen to have a contractor around doing some job for you, even if it is completely irrelevant to his job, you can ask him to buy the parts for you immediately and just charge it to the contract.

The problem is that the government is *supposed* to be spreading if effectively, to places where it is needed. But instead it is going into the pockets of a select few people who amass huge amounts of private wealth thanks to their contacts and buddies in government.

One (a wealthy one) might argue that this is fine due to the ""trickle down"" effect, but I hope that most of us here in the UK wouldn't fall for that bullshit.

You're exaggerating. It'll be ""change this tickbox of this section of your account at bt.com, or a 5 minute call to get someone to change it"". Or you ring BT, say ""MAC please"" and move to a better ISP with no filter. No permission needed. Hyperbole doesn't help your argument.

&gt; Thats at the moment, I'm sure that at some point a fee will become payable or some proof of age will be required. 

Has that happened with the mobile networks? Don't think so, I've never had to pay for the filter to be turned off (maybe once they charged a credit card with a token fee which was credited to your next bill / added to PAYG credit - but they had to charge something to prove the card worked). I have had to show proof of age, but that's pretty easy when you can go to one of their shops and not so easy at the other end of a phone, so the ISPs can't do that. The reason being showing age is that, of course, anyone can get a PAYG phone.

In the example you gave, you're only providing a pre-specified good with a specific price so it's easy to create a contract to cover it.

In most cases, especially where labour hours are required, or if the project is very large and it is difficult to predict every eventuality (exactly the kind of contract that G4S gets), then the contract is awarded with an estimated budget. There is always budget padding included for things that you can't predict right at the start.

The contract would also include clauses for early/late completion, over/under spending etc. But there is always wiggle room. There would certainly be a portion of the budget allocated to miscellaneous expenses which don't have to be individually identified and explained. It's not nearly as simple as you seem to think it is.

Whether British troops were fighting Nazis or fighting/exterminating indigenous tribes it was all just for the glory of Britain rather than ""freedom"". So they celebrate it equally. And they want others to bow down to the flag/royalty/military due to nationalism/patriotism. 

That's all it really is. I don't think the British common mindset has changed too much from the days of imperialism, just that the means to do so has been curbed extensively (and now we need to tag along with the US and bow down to Israel to get that feeling of the imperial era, why do you think the far right, the racists and the pro war fascists love those countries so much).

A leopard doesn't change its spots. Britain has never talked about 'freedom' like the US has, it has only done it recently as its had to tag along with the US. Otherwise Britain did everything it did for ""queen and country"".

I'm just pointing out the bare truths here, this country/military only fought for 'freedom' twice in the modern era, during WW2 and during the Falklands. Otherwise it was fighting for supremacy, economic reasons, neo-imperialistic ambitions or simply out of hatred for those perceived as others.

However, if it's getting squirrelled away into some offshore bank in the caymans or Switzerland for interest, or simply being spent abroad on expensive foreign goods or whatever (which is what the wealthiest people do, as opposed to your average person who spends the majority locally), then from the point of view of our country, it is as good as being burnt because it is no longer contributing to the flow of currency in the UK.

To use your energy analogy (which I'm warming to), when we light our house, all the energy we use (taxpayer money) is going into useful light, and also not so useful heating. The heating is still energy, but it is not doing what it's supposed to do, so it is almost useless to us (inefficient allocation of taxpayer resources).

You could say that the heating has some benefit in heating our house a little bit, so it's not completely wasted (someone is getting paid, trickle down effect). But the light is not designed for heating, it doesn't work like a convective radiator which heats the cool air at near the floor and circulates it around the room, thus heating the whole room (progressive taxation, social security). The light only serves to heat some air near the roof, and only a tiny bit of it, which is useless to us walking around on the floor.

Furthermore, when the light and heat escapes outside (money kept overseas or spent on imports), it is still energy, but for our purposes, it might as well have been destroyed because it is useless and irrecoverable to us now.

So when the government spends money poorly and directs huge amounts of taxpayer money to the pockets of their buddies, they are effectively destroying the money since it is no longer going into a useful purpose or work for which it is meant and is also likely to be removed from UK circulation entirely.",0,1384345098,null,0,false,0,cddac0d,t3_1qiv8n,t1_cddac0d,t1_cdda3mm,null,1428678390,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

If you sell it aged 65/70 and downsize (say, after kids have left home) you could well end up with a large cash amount and still no mortgage to pay.

Like most things, balance is key - I personally don't think a pension is right for me currently, but I may well invest in one over the next 10 years. Buying a house was a priority for my wife and myself as renting was so exorbitant, as well as the fact we had a lump deposit sum.

I had a decent scheme a few years back where an employer matched  10% for my 5%. Over the course of the year and a bit I worked there my pension sum ended up under £1k.  That's the only pension I have, and I view it as a bit of a dud. Frankly, I struggled to make rent that year every single month - and that 5% in my paycheque would have been far more helpful.

I agree that certain companies do that such as high tech ones that essentially create a new niche in the market with their products. The thing is that in competitive markets like this contract bidding demonstrably has little to do with the quality of service or cost effectiveness and a lot to do with ability to tender bids which tick the right boxes, mask ones own shortcomings and network with the right people.

All the taxes you argue that they would be paying would also be paid by another company filling the hole in the market that would be left if we told G4S and Atos to sling their hook.

A quick walk around the room by a doctor would determine who these cases are surely. 

I was in Durham hospital for a week last month ( my girls mother was dying ) the ward was around the corner from the A&amp;E department where I'd go because they have a shop selling coffees etc. People who apparently had nothing wrong with them ( well nothing life threatening anyway ) would turn up in the morning and still be there in the afternoon waiting to be seen. Why can't they be seen by a doctor quickly then sent away? 

I mean people will always have the fear of fear in them when it comes to health; a bad head becomes a brain tumour, a chest pain becomes a heart attack, a bad cough becomes lung cancer. It's just human nature. Especially as you get older. 


It just seems daft that they're kept sitting all day worrying about what's wrong with them in an A&amp;E department when two minutes with a doctor would clear it all up and clear the room for real A&amp;E cases. 

I don't think the telephone is the answer either, people want/feel the need to be seen. I remember ringing the NHS helpline a few years back because I was coughing up blood  ( turned out it was a cracked tooth that was bleeding in the back of my mouth and I was swallowing the blood, nothing serious at all. It was pretty serious to me at the time though, I didn't know what was going on ) The helpline rang me back the next evening. Completely bloody useless system. 

I mean is it me, or is the NHS just really badly managed when it comes down to things like this?

true,SlindsayUK,cnty-wales,Wales - Swansea,"Ahh, not quite. Technically that is how it's *supposed* to work but the reality is that there are at least two ways you can do just that by ensuring that you get the contract written the right way (most of the time). 

First, you can factor in a rate of change on the service that you are offering when tendering the bid and this can be quite enormous. You need to drum up some sort of justification for it ( http://www.notebookcheck.net/2011-Tsunami-expected-to-disrupt-electronics-production-cause-jump-in-worldwide-NAND-flash-prices.49598.0.html ) that the average evaluator of these contracts isn't qualified to evaluate but the enormous price hike rarely actually emerges in full. The benefit of this is that you can put in the full price hike, especially if you happen to be buying the laptops form one of your subsidiary companies....

Second, you can essentially make a ""good money after bad"" argument. Set up a front end almost shell company to fulfil the contract which actually wins the contract. Spend a bunch of money that is none recoverable then hike the price. Now if the government wants to remove the contract from you, fine, but you will declare bankrupcy before they recover any cash and the real company is unharmed. Alternatively they can agree to the price hike and get their product at an inflated cost.

Taking your example, you agree to procure the laptops for 200k with a 35k processing fee. The 35k processing fee is spent up-front on staffing, renting  a warehouse to store the laptops plus 50k in and down payments on the job lot of laptops to the parent company. At this point the price ""shockingly"" increases to 250k for the job lot of laptops. The government has 3 choices, either 1) cancel the contract and recover 150k from the shell company and put the bid out to tender again and be 85k out of pocket 2) agree to spend the extra 50k because it's cheaper than the alternative or 3) report the company and await the outocme of a 3 year investigation that will find nothing on paper to prove that the first company was set up explicitly to grab the cash.

Of course this is a gross over simplification of the process but do bear in mind, who do you think has better experts on contract law working for them, the civil service or the likes of G4S or Accenture or any of the other companies that have got away with this in the past?

Lets assume that only people who are of working age are included. I don't think that the video is actually doing that though given how distorted the statistics are. 

The other thing to remember is that it is measuring wealth - i.e. the value of assets and cash minus debt. It is extremely unlikely that they have the figures for debt...

When we see this video, lets assume a couple of things. 

Firstly - as you get older/progress through your career, you'll earn more. An apprentice plumber might be on £14,000, a fully qualified one with a good reputation and 30 years experience £65,000. 

Secondly - the three main sources of private ""weath"" in the UK are pensions, property and the value of your car. I imagine actual stuff - physical possessions if you will will account for far less, same with actual cash that can be spent (a tiny proportion of the whole).

So now lets do a thought experiment. Who in the UK is most likely to have say a large private pension - (having had 5-12.5% of their salary paid into it every year they've worked) - to own a property, to own an expensive car and to have accumulated expensive possessions over the course of their life? It is the elderly and in particular the elderly living in the south of England. 

That's why this video sucks, because it assumes that a recent graduate who's family have a pad worth £8m is worth nothing, it may or may not also assume the wife is worth nothing. There is no way of knowing because they haven't revealed their methodology. Either way it is misleading and sensationalist.

First of all, we have done 2 up front. We played for 20 mins with 2 up front just this past weekend, and it didn't do jack for us. We pretty frequently put defoe on with Soldado, and they play as a striking duo. Have we ever scored with the two of them on the pitch at the same time? Not that I recall.

We don't have 2 top strikers on the bench. Until he gets healthy, Adebayor cant be considered in the equation, and Defoe is not good enough to be on the pitch for a top 4 premier level team. No defoe fanboys, he isn't a top striker. Unless your opponent is the Minsk School for the Deaf FC, then he's gonna have a tough time doing anything.

Lastly, don't compare us to liverpool. They play with 3 defenders and good teams slice through them like jelly. Arsenal's defense kept the magical duo in check the whole match. Also, suarez and sturridge are much better than soldado and defoe. Its not even worth comparing the two.

You got a house out of it.

You obviously don't know how out of line house prices and earnings are - so much so that the government is stepping in to distort the market by offering taxpayer backed loans for the deposit, rather than helping to make prices lower to sane levels. If that means some people might have to take a loss in the imagined value of their house, so be it. The well being of the country is more important than a few people's house prices.

Since you don't know the situation, don't try and moan about it.

The problem with appreciation is that people are happy when their houses appear to increase in value (not that it matters while you're still living in it) but not when it goes down. So the government and other parties do all they can to keep the property price bubble from bursting, which means those who are on the market are fine while the rest of us suffer.

(My ideal) Opening scene to Day of the Doctor. 

EXT. SPACE.
A calm, opening shot of the cosmos is interrupted as the Tardis hurtles into frame. It's smoking, battled damaged and spinning out of control as it's being pursued by an onslaught of Dalek Ships. 

*EXTERMINATE! EXTERMINATE THE DOCTOR*

The Dalek ships continue shooting a barrage of laser as the tardis performs some tight manoeuvres to avoid the attack. One laser manages to hit it's target and knocks the Tardis off its rotation. The hit blew a fuel cell and more smoke begins spewing from the wreced Type 40. 

Cut to the inside of the Tardis. Smoke, sparks and all manner of destructive chaos plague the interior. Lights are flashing are and every warning alarm is going off as the camera pans around the console to reveal... The 8th Doctor, Paul Mcgann. He finds a brief moment to examine his console monitor and assess his pursuers.  
*EXTERMINATE! EXTERMINATE!*

The Doctor takes immediate evasive action and steers the Tardis through a nearby asteroid field. The few Dalek ships that follow him through the death trap meet a sudden end as they're unable to manoeuvre asteroids quite like the Tardis as it makes a clean escape out of the belt and away from the daleks. 
*YOU CAN RUN DOCTOR, BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE!*

""Well..."" he said running his hand through his hair with a sigh of relief. ""... Running's always been my forte anyway."" 

Suddenly a fleet of Dalek saucers materialise infront of the tardis stopping it dead in it's track. The doctor attempts to turn around but is met by more saucers. He's surrounded.
*AND NOW YOU CANNOT RUN!*

The doctor panics. He knows the Daleks would not give him a chance of his last words, they're going to exterminate him where he stands.
*CHARGE ION CANNONS! EXTERMINATE! EXTERMINATE THE DOCTOR!*

A few precious seconds. 8 rushes for the console, there's only one way out of this, blow the rest of the fuel cells!
*EXTERMINATE!*
The Doctor blows the fuel cells, a burst of energy explodes from the console, sending the doctor flying and the deadly energy rages throughout the whole tardis. It charges through the console centre structure and bursts from the Tardis light bulb.

The emission blows every dalek saucer out of the sky as they curse every word in the Skaro language. Whatever drifting wasn't obliterated is sent drifting outwards and only the Tardis is left slowly suspended in space. The console is completely dead. A few small lights still linger under the mainframe, the Tardis is still alive but will take some time to heal itself. The Doctor lays seemingly unconscious, but miraculously, slowly, picks himself up. He drags himself to the dead console, hanging his head in shame.

""I'm sorry, old girl...""  

Then his hands begin to glow a bright gold, he looks down at them heart heartbroken but relieved at the same. He stands back and straightens up as his face begins glow as well. He cracks his neck and sighs exhaustedly ""Here we go again...""

true,Limes19,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,"The problem is that the police can't just wildly throw around bold statements like ""it was OBVIOUSLY a murder"" without having *evidence* to back it up. I think having a justice system where that sort of thing would be possible is much more scary than the one we have now.

Now, if you actually read the article, the police are basically saying that they have no evidence to work with:

&gt;  an evidence review had found ""it was more probable"" no other person was present when he died in his London flat

and

&gt; a post-mortem examination carried out by a Home Office pathologist failed to determine the cause of death

So they can't find evidence that anyone else was there, and they can't work out *how* exactly he died. What do they do? They shrug their shoulders and decide to look at wilder theories of what might have happened:

&gt; During a seven-day inquest in May 2012, the question of whether Mr Williams could have padlocked himself into a bag in a bath was central.

So they spend a week (a *week*!) trying to padlock themselves in bags, before eventually deciding that

&gt; it was ""theoretically possible"" Mr Williams could have padlocked the bag from the inside, although ""many questions remain unanswered"" as to the circumstances of his death

I.e. ""Well, I *suppose* it *could* have happened like that, but it sounds ridiculous""

What do you want them to say? They're admitting they've got little/nothing to work with. They're admitting that, frankly, they haven't got a bloody clue what exactly occurred. They're attempting to draw tentative conclusions from the evidence they have (namely ""we can't find evidence of anyone else being there"", and ""we managed to padlock ourselves into a bag once""), while at the same time admitting that these conclusions are weak. There's not much else they can do - lack of evidence of foul play is not evidence that the security services were involved. They say it themselves:

&gt;  ...had made ""the logical inference that it was more likely someone else was involved in Gareth's death"".

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"Well purely from an economic standpoint, the more exports you have (ie. foreign money coming in), the better it is for your country because you're making stuff and selling it, creating jobs and paying people.

Imports are ""bad"" *economically* because the people getting paid are not your own citizens, and your money is flowing out of the country.

This is just economic theory though. In reality, like you say, every country has to export something and import other things. It's almost impossible to be completely independent. And trade is good. Trade allows countries to co-exist in a peaceful way and trade resources they have for resources they don't have.

So imports aren't really bad at all. Imports can actually be good for the society since they allow access to goods and services that cannot be provided in-country. This helps to raise the standard of living and adds variety and choice.

It is exactly as you said, it only becomes a bad thing socially when all the wealth, imports and money is concentrated within a relatively small group of people, ie. the wealth hoarders. It's not efficient or fair because it only benefits a small group of people who are already very well cared for.",0,1384350205,null,0,false,0,cddbd0n,t3_1qiv8n,t1_cddbd0n,t1_cddak46,null,1428677783,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,CrashingAnalyst,eng-gloucestershire,Cheltenham,"I've interned at a chartered accountants office, there's a lot of principles-based stuff that goes on. Essentially its a 'can you justify this?' system. So your jnr accountant will justify their decisions to senior accountant, who will justify to manager, who will justify to partner, who actually then has to justify to *other* partners at *other* accountants.

This forms a body of professionals who act in general agreement of principles each year, but the government supplements this with new guidance, rules and standards each year. So as you can imagine, there is actually a lot of scope for creativity, as long as you can justify what you've done with some logic (out of historical precedent / new regulation / new guidance / whatever really) then that's ok.

true,Thyrotoxic,cnty-wales,Not actually Welsh,"Right let's examine some of this bullshit.

&gt;You can be searched by police without a warrant.

Only in certain circumstances and only with reasonable suspicion. They have to demonstrate how there was reasonable suspicion in court if asked. 

&gt;If arrested police can search your home without a warrant. 

Police can only enter premises without a warrant if a serious or dangerous incident has taken place.

Situations in which the police can enter premises without a warrant include when they want to:

* deal with a breach of the peace or prevent it
* enforce an arrest warrant
* arrest a person in connection with certain offences
* recapture someone who has escaped from custody
* save life or prevent serious damage to property.

So points two, three and four about arresting people who are already wanted for crimes. Points one and five are to stop harm coming to people or property. The main reason we have a police force in the first place.

""If the police do arrest you, they can also enter and search any premises where you were during or immediately before the arrest. They can search only for evidence relating to the offence for which you have been arrested or to some other offence which is connected with or similar to that offence, and they must have reasonable grounds for believing there is evidence there. They can also search any premises occupied by someone who is under arrest for certain serious offences. Again, the police officer who carries out the search must have reasonable grounds for suspecting that there is evidence on the premises relating to the offence or a similar offence.""

If you've already been arrested for an offence your house can be searched without a warrant. Considering the police must already have reasonable suspicion to arrest you in the first place there's not really a problem here.

What's your point? I have no problem with people being arrested for carrying around knives (above a certain size mind you) with no reason. 

&gt;You cannot own a firearm in your own home for self defence. 

Not even going to get into this but most civilised countries don't allow you to keep a firearm in your home for self-defence, it has nothing do with becoming a police state. The British public do not want everybody and anybody to own a firearm because it's just plain fucking stupid. 

&gt;You can be arrested for using insulting language. 

Not any more, that [law was repealed.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21020737) 

&gt;Police cars and cameras have ANPR which also stores which cars passed through. 

ANPR just matches number plates with any cars that are stolen, wanted or untaxed and it can also be used to track movements of certain vehicles. This is perhaps the only half decent point you've made but I've still not really got a problem with it. 

&gt;Companies can be forced to hand over your personal data without a warrant. 

Elaborate. 

&gt;Councils have twats walking around with CCTV cameras. 

Council jobsworths are literally a police state. 

&gt;Illegally obtained evidence is admissible in criminal trials.

Now this is the biggest piece of crap in that whole post. [That's just plain not true.](http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/a_to_c/confession_and_breaches_of_police_and_criminal_evidence_act/#Unfairly)

It seems to me that Defoe has scored goals pretty consistently wherever he's been. West Ham. Spurs. Pompey. England. He puts the ball in the back of the net. Is he a world-class striker? No. Is his link-up play amazing? No. Does he consistently score goals for the teams he represents? Yes.

Last season he scored quite a few goals against shit teams. He also scored against Chelsea and Man City. I suppose those goals don't count. The season before that he scored against Liverpool, Man City and Man Utd. Again, I suppose they're now shit teams. 

Wow. So we played with two up front for 20 minutes last weekend and nothing happened? Well we played with one up front for 70 minutes last weekend and nothing happened either.

Do I think that, in an ideal world, I would start Jermain Defoe up front? Probably not. Ideally we'd have Messi, Ronaldo and Ibrahimovic up front. Do I think that it's crazy that we are massively struggling for goals and yet insist on keeping a proven Premier League goalscorer on the bench? Yes.

Maybe he went to an auspicious boys school and was abused, leading to extreme fetishes, while the 'old boy network' from the school allowed him to get access to this job. This does sort of tick all of those boxes. He'd have a 'dom' show up, put him in that position and then leave to return and let him out at a later point after he'd 'learned his lesson' or whatever the punishment entailed.

Something goes wrong. Maybe being knocked out before being punished is part of his thing, maybe didn't start breathing again and the 'dom' didn't notice. Maybe the 'dom' either doesn't show back up in time (deliberately or not) and leaves him; thus killing him through whatever eventually caused his death. Or possibly the 'dom' shows up late, realises the guy is dead and bolts after removing evidence. This 'dom' may even be relatively hairless to complete the sexual image with their own hair covered by a mask or the like. Again, I'm just hypothesising a sequence of events.

Matic basically fixes our midfield.  He's strong and athletic coupled with great intelligence and technical ability.  He's dynamic enough to contribute well in possession while also being very good at breakup play and shielding the back 4 through transitions.  We get caught out in midfield a lot because we don't have a mobile defensive player like Matic to plug the gaps.  Lucas is outstanding at what he does but he's having a bit too much asked of him at the moment.

Reus is the attacking player we've been dreaming of.  Imagine an attack force of Coutinho, Reus, Suarez, and Sturridge.  That's surely rival to or possibly better than any other attack in the league.

Neither will happen but hey, you asked for dream signings right?  I purposefully named players that are theoretically available because it's more fun to think about than ""Messi and Ronaldo!  Sign 'em up!!!"" but I don't see how we'd be able to attract either player until at least the summer.  Even then if either player really does become available there will be a host of top clubs lining up for them.

Now for a more realistic option: Davide Santon.  He'd be an awesome deputy for Enrique and I think he's got the potential to eventually displace the spaniard.  He's still quite young at just 22 years old and he's a capable left back going forward and defending.  I highly doubt Newcastle would let go of him of course but it doesn't seem like a huge stretch.  I really rate him and think he's got a lot of potential to continue developing.

true,Soul_Rage,null,null,"I've posted a few times before, but sure. Let's look at two examples from the article, one good, one bad.

We'll start with a good example:

&gt;Youth unemployment also showed signs of improvement, with the number of jobless 16-to-24 year-olds falling by 9,000 to 965,000.

Great. 965,000 unemployed. It used to be 9,000 more than that. 974,000. Nothing much to be confused about here. In fact, if we're rounding to the nearest 1,000, we can have an error of up to 500 in either direction.

Now, let's look at a bad example, and boy, do we have some *bad* examples this time around:

&gt;The number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance fell by 41,700 to 1.31 million in October.

Holy shit, this is *awful*. I'll pose a question to you though, given the above information, and you'll see my point: What was the number of people *before* the 41,700 fall?

1,351,700 - 41,700 = 1.31 million, ...right?

Hang on, you're making the assumption that it's *exactly* 1.31million. They didn't write 1,310,000 though, they wrote:

&gt;1.31 million

Because they rounded that number to 1.31 million, we could just as easily say:

1,356,699 - 41,700 = 1.31 million, rounded down.

Or:

1,346,700 - 41,700 = 1.31 million, rounded up.

But hang on, that would mean that we have up to 5,000 more, or less unemployed people. Everything would be just fine if they'd tell us both numbers with the same precision: 1353100 - 41,700 = 1,311,400 rounds to 1.31 million, for example, or the less accurate: 1.35 - 0.04 = 1.31 million.

Now, this might seem trivial, to anyone but a scientist or a statistician or someone else who works with numbers (I happen to be in the foremost category), but let's look at those two examples I gave in terms of percentage:

1,356,699 - 41,700 is a drop of 3.0736%


1,346,700 - 41,700 is a drop of 3.0964%

Again, it *looks* trivial, but where do you draw the line? Naturally you can see that this can potentially be used to put bias on numbers. Imagine if that 1.31 million was ""fifty thousand"" instead. Same level of inaccuracy, but the error is *vital*. Instead of simply assuming your numbers are big enough for nobody to care, I'd say **it is better to portray the numbers accurately, and precisely in the first place to avoid ambiguity and bias.**

Presumably, someone somewhere left out the significant figures, either because they didn't realise what they were doing with the software they used to handle those numbers, or because they were stupid. The BBC never lifts a damn finger when this happens to get answers though.

Once again, you are making a very big statement that bottle fed babies are a burden to the NHS. This is copied from the link you gave:

Conclusions: A history of breastfeeding is associated with a reduced risk of many diseases in 
infants and mothers from developed countries. Because almost all the data in this review were 
gathered from observational studies, one should not infer causality based on these findings. Also, 
there is a wide range of quality of the body of evidence across different health outcomes. For 
future studies, clear subject selection criteria and definition of “exclusive breastfeeding”, reliable 
collection of feeding data, controlling for important confounders including child-specific factors, 
and blinded assessment of the outcome measures will help. Sibling analysis provides a method to 
control for hereditary and household factors that are important in certain outcomes. In addition, 
cluster randomized controlled studies on the effectiveness of various breastfeeding promotion 
interventions will provide further opportunity to investigate any disparity in health outcomes as a 
result of the intervention. 


Once again, I'm not saying there are no benefits to breast feeding because i know there are, but as stated above there are a lot more factors to be thought of aswell.

Seriously? It happens all the time. Startup companies typically make a loss in the first year or two because of the startup costs so turnover &lt; outgoings. You wanting them to pay tax based on turnover would just add to the losses.

Likewise when a business invests in equipment or expansion. Typically that year and possibly one or two forward it makes a loss which you now want to make worse.

So lets take your local corner shop who operate on a 5% profit margin. Your turnover tax is 10%. That shop could have a record years turnover but make a loss because the tax is more than the profit margin. In fact that shop will never ever make any money because the profit margin will be less than the turover tax. 

And that's the problem with turnover based tax in that unless your profit margin is higher than the tax then every year you trade you'll lose money. You could have £1Trillion turnover but if your costs are £0.99Trillion and the turnover tax is say 5% you've made a £0.04Trillion loss.

Obviously if you want out, start looking for work. Make sure your CV is up to date and ""strong"", ask friends or family to proof read and offer suggestions if they are able. Depending on your career/field, sign up to some job sites, a good CV will get you interviews within a couple of weeks.

Just having a couple of constructive meetings with your superiors will improve your standing with them and help your cause.

Now, this is really important: Stay professional at all times with your current employer, do not burn any bridges or take any action which could cause you to be sacked.

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"The concerns aren't racist, I think in many cases that they could be valid, at least on a localised level. The issue, is though, that immigration is an inevitable thing if we want a globalist economic system. 

We can build walls and set up security checks and provide huge complex systems for the police to run and maintain but this has to be paid for as a certain percentage of our tax revenue, which means taking money away from education, hospitals, transport or the armed forces.

Then if we continue with these measures we'll have an *immigration industrial complex* in which the system can never get looser, budget cuts can never occur and there are huge business lobbies waiting to knock down any budgetary talks that propose the money would be better spent on people in this country or even improving living standards around the world.

To be honest, the EU rules on immigration are somewhat sensible, at least in logical conception; only when you have a certain structure of government can you be let into the main EU body. But whilst the rules are strict on economic policy, practically no social policy appears to exist. We should allow immigration to countries which have good social programmes and healthcare services as well as an industry capable of employing people on a living wage, thus stopping the mass immigration of the working class. Only then would we allow the free trade that the wealthy elite in these countries crave beyond all else.

But the conservatives of this country don't want you to think like this because you might realise that the economic system that they support at every turn, that is making them hideously rich, is the main cause of immigration of all kinds and the burden needs to be paid for by someone.

true,notnotcitricsquid,null,null,"A pension is a life essential. You're young enough that you're probably never going to have a state pension, by the time you reach the current retirement age it will either be the case that we're in some sort of robot utopia where everyone is provided for *or* we're a society as we are now but with so many old people that it's just not possible for a state pension to exist and so you'll be expected to work until the day you die if you can't afford to fund your own retirement -- this isn't hyperbole, it's an unfortunate reality everyone needs to plan for.

Ideally you would want to retire with around 60% of your final salary as your yearly pension value. To achieve that level of retirement fund you need to be contributing more and more throughout your working life, a good figure I've heard is your (age / 2) as a percentage of your salary as the absolute minimum, so at 26 you need your pension to have 13% of your pre-tax salary contributed to it this year, 14% next year, 15% the year after... so on and so forth. That will secure you a pension that allows you to retire in a way that doesn't require huge lifestyle sacrifices.

The problem with sacrificing your pension in favour of saving for a deposit is two-fold, firstly you lose the growth you would experience during the time you're not contributing which can have a big impact long term and secondly owning property is expensive, far more expensive than renting, this means that if you need to sacrifice your pension *now* you're probably going to have to continue sacrificing it once you own the property and won't be able to contribute again (in a significant way) until much further down the line, at which point you'll have to contribute even more to make up for it. A lot of people think ""I won't contribute to my pension this year so I can save more money... I'll contribute next year"" and then next year rolls around and they think ""one more year..."" and so on and so forth, a lot of people make it to 40 without any substantial pension and that is really bad -- again, not hyperbole, a pension is seriously important.

Your situation isn't all doom and gloom though, you're on £40,000 at 26 which indicates you're probably in a career (a fairly skilled one at that?) and not just making ends meet with a retail job, this means that you're probably going to be able to chart out your expectations of future promotions / raises and have a rough idea of where you're going to be financially throughout your life, this is hugely advantageous and will give you an idea of what you can afford to do.

I think that what you need to do is take a month or two and focus on saving as much money as possible, work out exactly where you are financially (what you can afford to save, what you actually spend per month on non-essentials) and then in a few months look over everything and make a plan, at that point you'll know how much you can afford to save and what sort of impact the £200 per month from your pension will have on saving towards a deposit, you'll also be able to plan out what sort of costs you'll incur once you do own your home. If you absolutely have to stop contributing to your pension and there's no other way to achieve your goals then so be it, as long as you make that decision knowing everything and with a plan for the eventualities you'll be *okay*.",0,1384358554,null,0,false,0,cdde49d,t3_1qd74q,t1_cdde49d,t1_cdd8fzt,null,1428676340,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2

This will save them the colossal headache of all the paperwork required to fire someone and will reflect better on you.

If you have nothing lined up, make sure you leave quietly, with no fuss (unless there is something fishy going on).

Yeah, it's easy to save when you have no bills to pay. I too had savings when I was shelf stacking aged 17.

true,slippyg,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"It's not illegal to grant an AST for less than 6 months, the Housing Act 1996 removed this requirement from Feb 1997, however (and what I assume you were getting at) the landlord cannot serve a valid section 21 notice before 6 months - therefore, realistically, the landlord would only be able to evict with a valid section 8 notice.

&gt;Notice - 1 calendar month either side

I assume this to mean that the landlord may give you 1 months notice to quit, in which case this bit *is* illegal. The landlord must give you two full months notice before applying to court for possession.

Also, did you pay a deposit for the property and were you served the prescribed information?

Without reading the contract OP, I would assume if you wanted to leave at the end of month 3, you should have given notice in month 2. The landlord/other tenant is right here IMO, he could claim for lost rent during the notice period (could be difficult to get the TDS to play ball) or take you to small claims court if you did not pay a deposit (even harder to get his money this way) This is all fairly unlikely since if the landlord knew what he was doing, he would have not given you a tenancy for 3 months. Just my opinion though.

It might be mutually beneficial to suggest the landlord that which I have outlined above, if he is difficult, and have a quick read up on what your rights are as a tenant, if you're going to carry on renting privately in the future.

That's before utilities, food, commuting, clothes. I'm not talking about TVs or iphones here, just general living costs.

Not saying it's easy, or even impossible - but £18.5k/ and 3k/year in savings in London? Whoa ! I would love to see your monthly budget breakdown.

Save money.

Be memorable. When you think of someone, you will always remember the good/bad stuff first. So in your final weeks, be as helpful/good/great/funny as possible. This is fresh in peoples mind for when they write that reference. Get your nose brown is essentially what you need to be doing.

Know your competitors. They are now your future employers. Check their websites for job postings (some may also list in the local paper).

&gt; No tax other than the National Insurance contributions paid by themselves

Their employees pay their own tax (albeit administered by them), but if you're suggesting that if these companies didn't exist there wouldn't be a need for employees to do the work, then I'm wondering why the government is paying them anything at all.  

For example, if the Government did the work that G4S did themselves without outsourcing it, then they would have to employ all those people, giving them their income tax and downstream taxes.",0,1384361913,null,0,false,0,cddfl97,t3_1qiv8n,t1_cddfl97,t1_cddahig,null,1428675622,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Next we need a new CB. As much as I hate to say it, but we should go after Pepe if he's relatively cheap. another DM/M would be handy too but we could always call back Barry and wait till next year. We also should look at the possibility of getting a new left back

TL;DR

In
Casillas (loan)
Pepe 

Out
Garcia
