I started watching Doctor Who right before modern Season 4 was going to start. I binged on three consecutive seasons, and then kept up to speed with it since, while simultaneously trying to chip away at classic episodes. I swear, I see no discernible change in the quality of the show through any of the modern seasons. It's remarkably consistent at being a cool, entertaining kind of silly with just the right amount of ""dark moments"" in it to give *real* depth to all the characters involved. It's a great show in its own particular niche - not really comparable to any other scifi/fantasy shows like Firefly or BSG. The magic of the show is still very much there. It's brilliantly fun - simultaneously ""easy"" on the brain for quality family fun time but with just the right amount of continuity between episodes to keep an overarching grand story rolling.

I've been waiting for the day that Britain did what it could to protect their way of lang, but he reap the benefits of being such stellar cunning linguists and manage to have bilingualism at a higher rate than us USers. I have a British last name and a cousin who married someone from there. I envy you all to the point where I tonically kick my ancestor for leaving and am looking into the Anglican church. I think we were Roman Catholics who didn't like the idea of the church of England. I've spent some time contemplating this and I had a kind of epiphany. Engle is angel in German and I don't need to go into the Germanic Anglo connection... It's my belief that when the Romans and whoever came to tour island they found a race of people so beautiful that they were truly angels.

I doubt if they're a regular thing though, and this was many years ago.   

The only real advice I can give is that once you've got her in a position to touch the snake, don't push her.  Touch it yourself, hold it yourself, and talk about how soft and gentle the snake is.  Talk to the snake and enjoy the interaction - make sure she's watching.  Maybe ask her every so often if she wants to touch it or try it, but don't push the issue or she'll get defensive and refuse.  Do your best to stoke her curiosity and let her overcome her fear herself - you can set up the meeting, you can make it so she's got the choice in front of her, but you can't force her to make the choice or it will be an awful day out.",0,1378786269,null,0,false,0,cc5anz8,t3_1m27jw,t1_cc5anz8,t3_1m27jw,null,1429529442,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

&gt;  I don't see the demand

Well, the demand is clear considering the West Coast Main Line is the most heavily used line in Western Europe, and the trains are pretty packed. There are several flights a day from London to Manchester that could easily be replaced by rail.

&gt; I don't see the returns

As for the returns, I believe the cost benefit analysis is publicly available. 

&gt; I don't see the need.

How do you propose we deal with increasing demand for rail travel over the past 2 decades with projections for this demand to continue?",0,1378791113,null,0,false,0,cc5c3om,t3_1m0x67,t1_cc5c3om,t1_cc4ykk5,null,1429528772,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Annaeus,cnty-expat,Having flashbacks to my time in 'Nam,"Not a lawyer, but I do have some experience dealing with contracts. There are at least three things, I believe, that prove that this is not a contract:

1) A contract requires a 'meeting of minds' - that is, a mutual agreement of the terms of the contract. The fact that the offer letter states that the terms of the contract have not yet been made available to you shows that there can not have been any such agreement.

2) A contract requires 'consideration' in order to be enforceable. That is, one of the parties must have provided something of value to the other. Neither of you has yet provided anything of value. Therefore no contract has yet been formed.

3) A contract can neither bind nor be contingent upon the actions of a third party, as those actions cannot be predicted and may invalidate the 'meeting of minds'. For example if the work permit is issued 20 years from now, then no reasonable person would expect you to take up the job at that point. There are simply too many variables outside of the control of the contracting parties for them to be allowed for, and so contracts are (generally) not contracts if dependent on someone else.

This last point is a little more complex than I have suggested, but this letter is more likely a statement of intent than a contract. As long as you are acting in good faith - i.e., not knowingly lying - then failing to meet the terms of the letter should cause no problems.

Guess what guys? HS2 wasn't drawn out on the back of an envelope one morning and funded for construction that very afternoon. Every detail of it has been studied, engineered, and reviewed and the conclusion has been that we require it. I find it incredibly depressing people in this country think that an opinion they form over 5 minutes of thought on the issue is superior to an experts. I turn on the news and it says ""2/3rds of businesses not convinced by HS2 case"". Well no shit- they weren't there when they were designing the damned thing. They have very little idea what it's about, just that it's costly. They probably wouldn’t have been convinced by the creation of the national grid either. It's ignorance, pure and simple

Therefore in my books, if you advocate Nazism, you also advocate cold blooded murder of civilians, children included. Why should one let that slide because it's freedom of speech? If someone was to publicly defend the actions of Peter Sutcliffe, Harold Shipman, and to top it off, Jimmy Saville, what consequences would they face? People would of course be enraged by what they said, and anyone who goes on their defense by saying ""well, it's freedom of speech"" will probably be just as berated. So why should it be different just when it comes to political beliefs? If your political beliefs shamelessly advocate violent oppression, and in cases like neo-Nazis, murder, why shouldn't they face some sort of consequence for what they say? I know the EDL aren't Nazis, but they're certainly fascists, and history has shown time again how when fascists take power they imprison and even kill people who disagree with them.

Feel: 

switching players seems more difficult (as in you'll switch to the wrong player unless you directional stick switch) 

players feel slower until they start accelerating

goals are kinda tough due to a combination of touch and the ball not being glued to players feet as much. i got some cool goals due to ball physics (namely the ball curved as it should have). 

Ultimate team: is pretty fun but they only have players for the 7 or so teams so everyone is stacked and your chemistry is 98-100.

UI: i like that you dont have to view player ratings to see the top 2 men of the match. the energy/stamina bars look flatter

I don't like one of the announcers for some reason

I'll give it more time but I figured I'd post and see what other people have to say tomorrow.

What this is, is tax evasion.

HMRC allows you to get re-reimbursed for ""reasonable expenses incurred in the line of work"".  Any other money you get from your employer is pay and is taxed as such.  It does not matter if you *call it* an expense or a bonus or a ""thank you"" or anything else.

The same applies to MPs:  The law did not care whether their expenses were permittable or not, but it was clear that they were taxable and since the tax had not been paid they were all guilty of that.

I know someone who worked for TfL, he was an expert at what he did but he lived in Scotland.  TfL wanted him so badly they paid him and also rented him a hotel room for 6 months.  Then that became 8 months.

Then he got a letter from HMRC saying he owes them a fortune because your employer can house you for 6 months if they require you to be somewhere, but as soon as you go over 6 months, that stops being a ""reasonable expense"" and becomes a, taxable, form of income.

I needed surgery last year.  I took me almost a year to get a diagnosis. They then told me the waiting list was another 9 till 12 months. I almost lost my job because the pain made it impossible to work. It wasn't until I requested treatment abroad that they bumped me on the list. 

There are plenty of countries that have mixed systems where patients pay small parts but where medical would never make them poor.

I promise, you are not the only one in your situation - if this is really, as you say, your dream, you can definitely manage it.

The only restriction you will have, due to having 2 years at uni already, is you may be limited to the amount of student loan you can get. However, I believe (and I hope I don't get your hopes up unduly, but i'm about 80% sure of this) you should be able to still apply for 4 more years of part time student loan to cover study costs. You don't even have to do a last year/2 years part time if you are happy to settle for a degree without honours - which does count for something on your CV - but if you want to go for honours, the OU can offer you finance at a really good rate of interest, much better than you would get from a loan or credit card.

Basically, you sound quite similar to how I felt a year or so ago. I thought I would get no support from the government and I was trapped in unfulfilling, dead end jobs.

Source:
My girlfriend is a nurse and says she is never sat down (to do paperwork) during her 13 hour shifts as all of the nursing rounds take up all of her time.

She loves it but believes that she can't give a high level of care to her patients because she has too many.


EDIT: We have had our fair share of problems with the NHS though:

She had an infected cyst that grew on her neck and gradually got worse. So she went to a GP, who put her on the list for a CT scan. there was a 2week wait (it was that short because she is a nurse and nurses get waiting list priority). 

Anyways during the first week it got so bad that we ended up in A &amp; E twice, they gave her morphine as the pain was so unbearable that she could no longer sleep. 

She would wake up in cold sweats completely delirious, shivering almost sleep walking around our apartment. By this point the cyst was bigger then a golf ball.
I was genuinely concerned for her life.

By this point the morphine had no affect so we went to A &amp; E again during one of her nightly terrors, and the nurses and doctors who saw her said this - and i quote - ""Unless you're dieing, we can't help you"".

Well fuck that, so we went private and got a CT scan. we paid about £500.00 for a scan and the private doctor was appalled at her state, so much so that he phoned up the hospital and said something along the lines of: if this woman doesn't have this cyst aspirated within the next three days she -will- die from the infection. By this point the cyst measured 8 cm by 6 cm in diameter

Needless to say, they booked her in the same day for an emergency aspiration at an ENT ward.

The cyst was aspirated and she was put on an IV Antibacterial drip and had to stay a few nights because they were so concerned about her (she was ravaged by a fever, hot sweats, basically the infection was really bad).

Anyway she had an MRI 4 weeks on the waiting list (with preferential nursing treatment) + 2 weeks for a cancellation.

Then she saw a consultant who, armed with the CT scan and MRI said:  if she doesn't get it operated on then it will keep getting infected, and with each infection the risks during the operation increase greatly due to scar tissue. He also was appalled at the way we were treated at A &amp; E and by the GP who both decided not to treat this as an emergency case. As a result of the scar tissue from the repeated infection (by this point she had to have it aspirated and be put on antibiotics twice) that the surgical incision will now have to be over double what he would normally do.

its on her neck, so ear to chin. Needless to say, we will be suing.

I just don't feel that huge investment in rail is the way forward if the system of rail operation remains the same as it is now, as we'll just have a network of high speed Super First Class business rail which would price out the majority of low-average earners, who would have to use the inevitably under-invested and degrading *""Pleb Rail""*.

HS2 will only be worth it if the entire system of how railways contracts are written and distributed across the private sector is overhauled so that rail becomes actually affordable.

Currently our mass transport system seems to go against the entire point of mass transit: *moving large amounts of people should be cheaper than individually*, currently most of the rail journeys I've looked at in the last couple of years have worked out either similar or cheaper for two people to share a car instead, which is crazy. 

So either the system changed, or I forsee:


* Once (eventually) constructed, the HS2 will run alongside the already existing line

* It will be dished out with subsidies to whichever company bids the highest

* Due to it being ""new!"", ""high speed!"", the ticket prices will be astronomical in comparison to the already high costs of the existing line next to it

* Because of that, it will essentially become the **""Super First Class Business""** train, with only those possessing larger disposable income or expenses utilising it",0,1378810332,null,0,false,0,cc5ez43,t3_1m1prk,t1_cc5ez43,t3_1m1prk,null,1429527432,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1
true,wish0r,lfc12,,"While the article explains quite well how Liverpool could play with the players at its disposal and lists a number of arguments, I don't think Rodgers will change his playing philosophy.
The defenders that have been bought are there to replace the ones who cannot play a high defensive line like for example Skrtel. Also there is no need to change the formation, whether we are now using our current formation 4-2-3-1 or Rodgers' preferred 4-3-3, our forwards will always be encouraged to interchange positions. So it doesn't matter if Suarez starts on the right wing. Once the game is underway, he will inevitably be across the whole width of the pitch, just as Sturridge is right now. Coutinho will be placed behind the striker as the attacking midfielder while a left winger/inside forward will play where Coutinho plays now. 
A 4-3-3 is a very compact formation with its emphasis on penetration through the middle, so to compensate this Rodgers is using wingbacks more effectively than other formations/managers. 

To play his preferred formation, almost everything is in place. We have attacking wingbacks, a creative attacking mid, with Moses now 3 very very dangerous forwards and basically 2 holding mids. The only thing, besides some minor tweaking, that needs to change are the centre backs. They were not able to play a high defensive line until now (see last season with Carragher not being fast enough) which is why it was imperative to invest in defenders. 

However Rodgers starting the first 3 PL games this season with a 4-2-3-1 (in the league cup the formation was more of  4-3-3) which seems to suggest that either he doesn't trust Agger or Kolo (who is never going to be the solution in the long term) to play the high line or he doesn't think that a midfield of Gerrard, Lucas and Coutinho would be enough to gain control over the likes of Stoke, Aston Villa and ManU, physically strong and pressing opponents, which is a valid point. 

I am very curious to see how it pans out but I don't think he will resort to a 3-5-2 formation, bar maybe one or two games like e.g. Chelsea or Arsenal away where it is imperative to man mark their creative player.",0,1378810345,null,0,false,0,cc5ez62,t3_1m3iah,t1_cc5ez62,t3_1m3iah,null,1429527431,19,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,19

It would certainly give Glen and Jose much more license to get forward, and allow our ball playing CB's to get forward as well. Seeing Agger moving into midfield with Stevie and Lucas would be amazing.

With Johnson's injury hanging over the team, I think Henderson could even operate well at the RWB role in this formation. 

On paper, this does allow us to field out strongest team at the expense of one attacking wide player that many people agree we really need to have an effective 433 side.

Ultimately if you buy stock, have difficulty selling it, can not afford the running costs of the business day to day, you will be in dire straights.  Then something happens and you have to take the cost of some returns or similar.

You need to plan out precisely what your going to have as costs, separate out the running costs that re-occur, figure out the nesceisty of each cost.

With the goods, it helps to have a rough probability of how many you can sell vs buy in.  Keep track of which ones sell quickly, which ones sell quickly at first, then slowly as the market gets statured.  The art is getting the prediction of what people want right.

But because it's owned by us, we can sort them. We can demand changes. 

Take a step back and think about how good it is in the context of humanity's history and the rest of the world today. I can feel a little ill today and get a doctor's appointment within the week.

The need for empty beds and the worry of hospital-based infection means that people aren't given enough recovery time in hospital. All terrible flaws. All things that need changing. 

We have a very high standard of what constitutes good healthcare. As a result, our healthcare is great. But we do, and should, continue to apply those high standards.

Importing for small amounts can be done via normal post (you'll get a charge when it arrives as the sender fills in a declaration of the amount it costs). When you start importing amounts that can't go through the post then you can look into this more seriously.

If you use Paypal then a normal account is only ok for a certain amount (can't remember how much, something like £1500) per year so you may need to move to a business account (which is free).

This won't cost you a penny.... if you get a lot of interest you might want to consider a dedicated website for it, or listing on eBay to get national/international visibility. But until that time I would personally start from the ground up, don't waste time/money getting a site set up to launch a product until you are seeing demand for it.

If there is demand, then I would next look to contact the existing retailers who are selling this product. You can either try and compete with them directly, or you could strike deals with them to supply the fabric at a wholesale to them, which would then draw on their existing customer base.

I had a college who'd fly herself out to Guiana (sp?) for dental work, it was cheaper and better quality than she was finding locally.  

Many Transsexual's fly out to Thailand for their surgery, it is regarded as the best place to go for the most cost effective care and using the latest surgical techniques in that regard.  I'm sure if you poke your nose in to those areas of reddit you'll find a small army all saying Thailand's better than the NHS. 

I couldn't get Charing Cross MHU to talk to St. Mary's Dermatology they're mutually exclusive attitude and ignoring the issues in favour of procedures which could not adapt to two rare conditions interacting resulted in letters from both saying ""TTFN"", so I can't actually get treated by the NHS.  I've also had GP's and Consultants outright lie to my face about what they are doing and what drugs they are prescribing.  Which really is wonderful care by wonderful staff.

Firstly there's myself, I was a bit of a clumsy one in my early years, so I've been to the local A&amp;E more than a few times, the only time I've been waiting longer than I should've relevant to my injury was when I'd split my hand open at the age of around 8 and wouldn't see a doctor without 'Mummy' I'd been taken there by a friends parent as that's where I was at the time. Whenever I had an asthma attack I was seen to immediately, suspected broken hand at 10pm, required a short wait as I wasn't in pain. I've always had wonderful GPs and Nurses, they know what they're doing, they're friendly and when needed to be - discrete.

Then, there were two important people in my life who I've lost to cancer. The first being my high school friend Daniel, who was diagnosed with Leukaemia at a young age, the staff and care provided to him at Alder Hey were second to none. They were professional whilst still being able to keep his spirits up through friendship. Their facilities were excellent and the few times me and other friends visited him on the ward (we mostly waited until he was home) there was plenty for us to do that 'normal' teenagers do.

Then there was my Grandad. In 2011, he finally had his back pain checked up on. Tumours had developed on his spine, a scan showed the cancer had spread to his lungs and liver. His consultant was excellent, no bullshit, just the facts and what needed to be done. Within a couple of weeks my grandad had gone through a course of radiology to shrink the tumours on his spine. He was too weak to walk from then on, but he was in less pain and we had more time. But I digress, it was the staff that cared for him in the last week or so of his life that stood out. They were great for all of us, did everything they could to maximise his comfort and ours when family members stayed the night in his room. 

I feel like I'm rambling on here, or rather I know I am. But I'm just trying to get across what I always say - The NHS is a fantastic service, but I agree something needs looking at. In my personal experience the staff are excellent, it's the management that needs tending to.

I'm a student and I've never needed my parents' help moneywise (although this is down to me working over the summer and in my year out). 

Rent is the biggest expense is rent. This is paid whether the student is at home or otherwise. And the students who get the £6k will be from low income families. Let me outline a budget which one could easily stick too.

£325pm for rent.

£30pm for bills.

£250pm for food and 1-2 nights out.

Then its just a case installing woocommerce (which is stupidly easy especially if you only have two products!), finding a shop template you like (google woocommerce templates) and you're off. 

As for SEO, get a plugin such as yoast which will guide you through optimising your pages and if its as niche as you say then it won't take much effort to start ranking for it. If you were willing to pay for someone else to do it, have a look at freelancers sites like people per hour and you can get someone to spend a couple of hours doing it for you on the cheap. 

There lots and lots of help out there on this, so if you're willing to put the hours in you will be able to figure it out.

Meanwhile, Lamps has slowly lost his place in the Chelsea midfield, to the point where he's not even a regular starter under Mourinho, and they only resigned him because Abrahmovic personally stepped in last year. Gerrard, on the other hand, has seen his numbers steadily decline; he scored 20 goals 3 seasons between 05-06 and 08-09, but since has only managed to get to 10 twice, while also battling injuries &amp; overseeing a general decline at Liverpool.

Sneijder is a key part of his Galatasaray team, a team that's done quite well in the CL considering their league's relative size and stature.

Also; I think comparing Paulinho to Stevie G is a perfectly acceptable thing to do. From what I've seen of Steven Gerrard, they have fairly similar play styles, especially now that Gerrard is playing more defensively for Liverpool; both are ""true"" CMs, willing to go box to box, and able to contribute in the attack both creatively &amp; scoring.

I'm not saying Paulinho is as good as Gerrard, but if you actually read my post, you'll notice that I say that I think that Paulinho could be our engine room guy the way Gerrard is for Liverpool; most of what we do will run through him, the same way it does at Liverpool, and though Paulinho isn't going to be a one-club player, he could very well be with Spurs for a very, very long time.",0,1378814199,null,0,1378814512,0,cc5fjfc,t3_1m19bb,t1_cc5fjfc,t1_cc4zrh0,null,1429527169,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

I know that my first interviews (which were for gap year jobs) were complete shambles but it meant that by the time I did a real interview (for undergrad, then for a placement and then for postgrad), I was as ready as I could ever be.

Cambridge is also part of the ""Oxbridge"" that you seem to dislike, so I don't see why you would believe that Oxford would reject her based on her class while Cambridge did not. To me, it seems clear that after an undergrad at Harvard, she came back to do a postgrad interview at Cambridge and was obviously much more mature, informed and prepared than she was so many years ago trying to get into Oxford undergrad. People grow up a lot in a few years.

Furthermore, you must realise that places are limited for everyone going to Oxbridge. It's not a competition against the university, it's a competition between the applicants. Who's to say that the other 5 people who did succeed to get into the Oxford medicine course couldn't also have got a scholarship at Harvard if they had applied?

You're judging a great university based solely on the fact that one smart girl got rejected and found a place at another place (edit: not to mention judging the whole of Oxford based on one college, of which there are 38(44 with PPH), each with distinct attitudes and reputations). Literally hundreds if not thousands of very clever students get rejected from Oxford and Cambridge. Not because they aren't good enough, but because they can only accept a limited number of people. Shouldn't we be happy that this girl went on to an alternative, possibly even better university?",0,1378814645,null,0,1378827440,0,cc5fm45,t3_1m2cin,t1_cc5fm45,t1_cc5fcsu,null,1429527134,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

true,ColonelMolerat,null,null,"Yup, they taught that. You don't really need to know too much detail though, as long as you track your accounts correctly - when you submit your tax return, your 'claim back' is deducted automatically.

To try and put things simply:

* Write down **everything** you earn and everything you spend.

* Categorise it into personal money ('drawings'), one-off-business-spendings (new computer, shelves, etc - 'capital expenses'), stock, utilities, rent and travel. You can get away with nothing more than drawings, capital expenses and 'other' business expenses, but it helps to be detailed

* For things that are 'split' between categories, write down how much each part is. For instance, if your rent is £1000 for a five-room house, but one room is used only as an office/warehouse, £800 is 'drawings' and you can claim the one room (1/5 of your house, or £200) as 'business rent'. Similarly, if you spend £500 on a new computer that you're using for work half of the time, you can put £250 into 'capital' and £250 into 'drawings'.


* KEEP ALL OF YOUR BUSINESS RECEIPTS

* At the end of the year, you do your accounts. They're pretty easy to do, but boring. If you earn under a certain amount (I can't remember exactly, sorry), you only need to input - how much money your business brought in - how much you spent on capital expenses ('one-off' payments, such as the computer) - how much you spent on 'day-to-day' running the business (stock, electricity etc). Obviously, whatever money is left is your personal spendings. Your taxes will be then calculated for you.

My tip is to register for online banking. Write down your balance on a spreadsheet and every day write down the transactions that show up online. Add/subtract them from your balance on the spreadsheet and categorise them. Your online balance should be the same as the one on your spreadsheet. If not, you can look for where you've made a mistake. Have a separate section for cash earnings/spendings that won't show up online. (I hope I've explained that clearly, it's actually pretty simple).

I've probably made all that sound more difficult than it is. We were told a story of a shop owner who put all of his receipts in a sandwich bag and wrote all of his incomings on the outside of the bag. When doing taxes, he deducted one from the other, and that was good enough.

Edit:

I did two half-day courses a couple of years ago. I am NOT an accountant, nor do I have any other training. You should be fine if you are open and honest about ALL your incomings (I even include busking earnings), but if in doubt, seek out an accountant and don't blame me if it all goes wrong.",0,1378814704,null,0,false,0,cc5fmhr,t3_1m3fab,t1_cc5fmhr,t1_cc5f52t,null,1429527129,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

As long as you're smart and know the eBay rules then you won't be shafted by eBay buyers. In my experience, of around 1000+ transactions, I've only had 2 or 3 dishonest eBayers that I've had to ""deal"" with.

eBay is a fantastic starting point, great proof of concept and it's nice to get those first sales to motivate you and prove to yourself; this actually works! Also, it doesn't take any investment so you won't be massively out of pocket if it doesn't work.

My plan has always been to expand into a private website so I know a fair bit and I have past experience of running websites that make money, though not e-commerce sites.

Shopify is what I'm set on, it provides everything - hosting, support, payment gateways etc - you only need to supply a domain name and set everything up, they do the rest.

As for SEO, already seen some bad advice in here, it gets an extremely bad rep and a lot of misinformation but it's dead simple once you know the basics.

Last thing you want to do is buy SEO from a company because you'll end up getting blog spam or you'll end up paying through the nose for things you should be doing anyway as part of your marketing plan.

SEO has always been thus; get your site mentioned on other sites, the more relevant and authoritative, the better. However people like short cuts so quickly SEO became SPAM SPAM SPAM and unfortunately that can provide fantastic results albeit short term.

A long term SEO plan and marketing plan are the same thing, you just need to tweak it slightly to accommodate SEO.

Something like guest posts are great, you contact the owners of sites related to your business and you propose a guest post (10 Things You Can Do With Technical Fabric, An Expert Guide To Technical Fabric etc) and you include some links in the guest post.

Right there you will get traffic directly from that guest post to your site, and you will get some powerful, relevant links to your site. Whilst doing something you should be doing anyway in online marketing. That is pure white hat SEO and that's just scratching the surface.

Now if you want a professional guest posting service from a web company then you will be looking at something like £350 !PER! guest post, when you can accomplish that yourself with a few emails and a few hours of writing.

Good luck!

P.S. Once you make the move from focusing on your own website from eBay, keep your eBay business going. Why kill a cash cow you've created?",0,1378814848,null,0,false,0,cc5fncd,t3_1m3fab,t1_cc5fncd,t3_1m3fab,null,1429527118,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

I seriously don't give a shit about having to wait for a few hours in A&amp;E, or having an operation pushed back a few months. Better than paying through the nose for ""cover"" that only paid out for about 70% of extortionate hospital bills.

Right, I don't think that means what you think it does.

Currently there has been a ""big debate"" about cycling safety. We've had policeman actually blaming the cyclist for not wearing a helmet as a cause of death, when the more likely candidate is the truck/car. Elsewhere in parliament MPs have been saying the only thing that can be done to get people cycling is to penalise those cyclists cycling on the the pavement or going through red-lights. The general narrative is there isn't space, there isn't money and only the cyclist can ensure her own safety on the roads—nothing can be done.

Police were quick to blame Sheppey Crossing as having a bad design—more road signs, better lighting, etc—the [BBC was quick to blame the fog](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-23970047) and calls it an ""accident"", so not negligent then. Not once have I heard the blame being put on unsafe speed and tailgating.

Furthermore, small contractors usually take the time to learn all the regulations and things they need to do rather than having to have their hand held like bigger contractors do, since the latter are somehow both smart enough to be constantly looking for loopholes and stupid enough for it to be a difficult transition process from one shitty contractor to a better one, since the new contractors aren't familiar with the process.

It is this same echo of former glory, and the constant heartache and hard-to-vanquish remnant of hope for its return, that drive my fanhood. This is why I love Spurs. The echo of Bill Nick's time and our tottering on the edge of the top 4 that make me a fan. Except with Spurs, I have true hope that this isn't just another year of failed potential.

I really enjoyed the flow of the game the chess match that it seems to be between masterful midfields. I decided I would give a crack at watching some actual league matches and pick a side. It was around that time I could a tottenham match and fell in live with the team and gareth bale who's runs down the wing were incredibly exciting to me so I chose them. Also I found others leagues to be a bit dull for me, Spain seemed like a 2 team league, Italian soccer seemed slow and bundesliga just doesn't have much coverage.

I really like bale and van set vaart from the start but really learned to love the team in general. As I learned more and more of the game I learned to appreciate the magic of a great midfielder over what previously attracted me which was mostly pace and scoring which is almost drilled into you as what really matters as an American. But I learned really how much every player plays a part and really just fell in love with the team, I mean gareth got me started but I stayed around because of how loveable the team seemed to me as I kept learning of guys like Sandro whom seemed like great players to cheer for. We kept adding people I generally find amazing like Jan whom is another player I found impossible not to love. I mean I am not the longest tenured fan that's for sure and I'm still learning more about tottenham all the time,  I am no expert. I am glad I picked the side I did though so young and so much potential. It's like this team will grow with me as I become more and more in love with this wonderful club. COYS!

The only one that didn't make the move to the United States (well, he did, but he was deported, it's complicated) lives in London and has season tickets for Spurs, attends a few away games a season and will travel to their European games if the destination is at all desirable. You might see him on the sideline at home games, he's right on the sideline and has an Irish flag with the Spurs logo and ""Tottenham Hotspur Pride of London"" written on it. He's been on the Spurs website a few times and Robbie Keane would sometimes point to him after scoring goals being the Irish national team captain. I asked him why he initially chose to support Spurs and he told me it was because when he was growing up in Ireland they had the best Irish players and that the Lilywhites was also the team name for his home county of Kildare as well as the nickname for Spurs. Anyways, his enthusiasm and passion for the team is infectious and he gets to you at a young age. When my daughter was born 20 months ago he sent a care package from London with lots of Spurs baby clothing and a chirpy rattle. Whenever I was in London he'd get the tickets next to his to bring me to the games.

Whether as a starter or from the bench, he will give 100% and play for the shirt, so well that, whilst Villas-Boas might have hoped to phase Lampard out in accordance with his vision for Chelsea, he actually ended up relying on him.

&gt;Not that Frank feels the need to prove anything to anybody. He demonstrated moral grit and heart upon our wildest dreams in the 2007-2008 season, when Chelsea faced Liverpool in the Champions League, just days after Pat Lampard, Frank’s mother, passed away.

&gt;Ballack won the penalty, and I’m sure many would have felt safer, nay preferred for Ballack to take the penalty. Had Lampard missed, it would have hurt so much more than any other penalty miss. This was more than just the penalty that paved our way to the Champions League final. For me, him scoring that penalty was one of those life-affirming moments in football. Life triumphed over death.

&gt;To even play for Chelsea following such a huge tragedy of losing his mother showed what a great professional he is. To score a penalty, under such pressured conditions, when there were other penalty takers on the pitch who could have shouldered the burden showed what a great player he is. His heartfelt tribute to his mother showed what a great man he is.

Thing to remember is that the NHS needs more money, lots more money to operate at anything close to what it should be. While I understand the anger here and certainly someone should be punished for it, I do hope you don't get a big settlement. This sue everyone culture we seem to have picked up from the yanks doesn't really work in the long run and it means the NHS need to hire yet more people who deal with legality and considering the pay many are on you're sacrificing 2-3 nurses for 1 legal person to deal with complaints and even they will be overworked.

So if you do press the matter legally do not have money (beyond basic compensation for loss of earnings etc) on your mind it's not going to help you and all you will end up doing is making the entire system just a little bit worse. If anything push to have someone reprimanded and have to explain why the staff level in A&amp;E was so low or poor and demand a written apology.

true,34Mbit,eng-Bristol,Bristol,"If multiple rolling stock operators were to run on lines simultaneously and voluntarily, then no one would want to serve the currently unfeasible remote 'parliament' lines, that everyone shits a proverbial brick over whenever closures are tabled.

Currently, when franchises are dished out the operator is told to eat the costs of the crappy lines as a nod to a public service remit. It's the same for Royal Mail in how they service remote cottages in east Scotland.

If a *true* market was to be opened for the railway line, then an honest and frank discussion needs to take place around how people in rural and suburban areas need to suck up the cost of making their own transport (and post, and telecom) arrangements rather than be subsidised by urban folk.

On the one hand, we're all humans and deserve a minimum level of civility from society such as running water, electricity access and delivery of post, but at what point does the line need to be drawn between providing a minimum service, and one group of people trying to feather their own nest at the expense of others.

For example, should those who *choose* to live in rural and remote areas, enjoying the benefits of a peacful and quiet lifestyle, clean air, nice views etc. be allowed to demand that those who *choose* to put up with the smokey air, traffic and crime of urban areas share their easy access to telecom services, quality public transport and choice of public services (GPs, schools, etc.)? Sounds to me like a lot of take and not much give from those who decide urban life isn't for them.

The extreme on one end is to cut running water access to the most expensive 10% of properties, and then slash the water rates in half for the remaining 90%, but expect that 10% to make up the £100,000's it costs to service them themselves. The opposite extreme is to provide 100Mbit/s broadband to 100% of houses, but charge each property £250/month, where it would only cost £3/month for 75% of properties.

It's all about the 5th to 95th percentile.

1. Acceleration isn't a flip of the switch, you've got to build up speed and get a full head of steam. It really emphasizes better choices of runs as a result. 

2. Trying to keep the game more fluid, they'll chase down balls for throw-ins more than ever. 

3. It's fun as always.

6. Skills moves matter even more, because the game's pace feels slower/more realistic.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt; Arguably, the method they used is more important as it hasn't really been used for macroeconomics. 

Indeed, it is an interesting approach, but unless this is very different the flaws are known in microeconomics, namely you have to really make sure your model matches reality.

From the article:
&gt;This caveat is the zero lower bound (ZLB) of monetary policy: the U.K. out-of-sample counterfactual corresponds to a liquidity trap environment, but the in-sample data overwhelmingly do not

I wonder how they are able to frame this in the macroeconomic context.   The effect of QE, the fact a lot of the liquidity loss in the credit crunch was due to temporary sentiment, my fear is that IPWRA still needs to have bound defined for these inputs (this is my amateur 100mph understanding).  As such it is very hard to have a good peer group to asses the performance against.

As you say the take away from this is that cutting spending during a recession makes growth harder.  The problem is solving the optimisation task of where is the sweet spot of debt costs vs spending.

The classic example for me is we spend more on debt management, than on helping the disabled. (http://openspending.org/ukgov-finances-cra).  Given that the price of running our debt can fluctuate, as governments tend to be opportunistic with borrowing at the short end, the 'debate' will still continue.",0,1378825890,null,0,false,0,cc5ifki,t3_1m3o1j,t1_cc5ifki,t1_cc5hbts,null,1429512988,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

They offered various features to allow true p2p lending, such as listings where you could decide who to lend to, and also various ways to set your own requested rate.

Now its basically turned itself into a fund (called SafeGuard), where you throw money into it and you get the global rate which Zopa has decided on. There's no choice to be made, no way to reject their rate, and you don't find out what rate you got until your moneys already been lent out. 

In short, Zopa have reinvented themselves as a completely different business, and is not an attractive one for a lender.

I'm looking at Zopa alternatives too, but my understanding is liquidity is proving to be the main problem with all of these platforms, since there are too many lenders and not enough borrowers.

The problem with cases like this, and the public perception of them, is that the court decision is misunderstood. You can't draw any conclusion from this result other than there was not enough evidence to conclusively find him guilty. 

You could go a step further, and say that the time it took the jury to hear the evidence and find him not guilty implies the evidence wasn't anywhere *near* conclusive,  i.e. it wasn't a hard decision for the jury.

However, that doesn't mean he is definitely guilty or innocent. Rape is sadly a notoriously hard to prove charge in a court of law. Ideally you need forensic evidence, only really available if the victim went to the police / hospital relatively soon afterwards. Otherwise, it often becomes one person's word against another.

true,Generalimsso,1986,John Obi Mikel,"I'm from Hong Kong and football is quite popular here for a long time but the domestic teams have been declining. So people tend to follow European football more than the local ones. EPL has been a big thing for years I think it was because the massive advertisements of the live broadcasts.. And EPL is more popular than other leagues mainly because the games play earlier so people in Asia don't need to stay up late to watch it, and also the pace of the games. 

But I didn't watch EPL until 2003. When I was a kid I watched WC 98 and 02 (even bigger since it was held in Korea and Japan). It was more like a summer carnival to watch football on TV with family and friends. 

My dad applied the EPL TV Plan in 2003 so I started to watch it since then. As everyone knows it's the Arsenal's season and they caught my attention at first. However my feelings toward Chelsea grew stronger as the season went. Mostly because players like Gudjohnsen and Duff and shared sympathy with Ranieri. And I like blue too.

But when I really decided to follow Chlesea it was because of Mourinho's arrival. He is just a charismatic manager that you can't reject to not follow him. When he first landed on the Stamford Bridge I knew we could achieve everything. I started to become a Blue. Although Mourinho's departure quite upset me but I remained a loyal Blue.

It really can't be narrowed down to one television show, as there are far too many I adore. But that list is a small selection of those I find most impressive. 'The Thick Of It' being probably my all time favourite series that I have ever watched, the counterpart film made for both a US/UK audience 'In The Loop' is equally as brilliant and I can't recommend it.

QI, A Bit of Fry &amp; Laurie, Stephen Fry in America. Generally as a bit of a Fry &amp; Laurie die-hard fan I have to say all these shows have a timeless place in my heart/Netflix. They're all available on the US Netflix at the moment I believe, if QI is not, there are episodes available on Hulu. Perfect for your standard British dry-wit and absurdity.

The IT Crowd, Black Books, Spaced and all these more recent comedic sitcoms are actually also brilliant. Spaced specifically will appeal, because I know a lot of Americans who loved Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. So Spaced will definitely translate brilliantly.

Just one example of this: I visit a doctor in France for what appears to be a very bad and chronic sinus infection, the doc examines me, gives me some real possibilities based on my odd symptoms (possible surgery needed for a specific sinus abnormality) and orders me a scan and blood work. I get all this done and pop back the next day to grab my the scan and bloodwork (to keep) and the radiographer tells me I have no frontal sinuses at all, which could obviously play into what I am experiencing.

I don't have long enough over there to follow up with the GP, so I follow up in the UK through the NHS with a ENT specialist in central London. After a few months, I go to my appointment. The doctor examines my sinuses, shrugs his shoulders and gives me an over the counter nasal spray with no real follow up. He was not interested in the scan or bloodwork and was even less interested in another doctors possible theories. The French GP was superior in every way to this specialist. 

Now, I just live with the weird shit my body throws at me until the day I can move to Europe or pay for a real doctor.

She is alive right now because she changed practice. The new GP took one look at her, knew what it probably was and put her in hospital immediately.

On a local level, a trust or provider should be able to locate its services in an area that is most effective at delivering care to the local population. Time and again though, hospitals stay open (generally unsustainably) because of local political pressure (which is part driven by residents who do not consider the bigger picture). Let's take stafford for example. Stafford was/is still an acute hospital in the middle of the county. It doesn't need to be, and its location (being fairly isolated) and the draw for staff to the bigger university hospitals in the region were contributory towards the events that unfolded there (low churn of staff, lack of new oversight, etc). There were arguments to downgrade it but the locals never want to see their local hospital downgraded, and the political pressures generally win over. Similarly the hospitals near me are all at minimum staffing levels because the patients are spread between too many hospitals. Can we close one and boost the level of care across the remaining sites? Good luck for trying. Local groups make it practically impossible. Instead we have a nurse ran off her feet on each site because its only viable at minimum staffing numbers, yet if we had more patients on one site we would have more than the minimum and they'd have more time for each patient. Local politics really damage the NHS, probably more than stuff on a national level.


Then we have national politics. The current NHS reforms are pushed through with little thought to their implementation or execution. The problems my trust faces at the moment - especially those that draw complaints - are due to the poor organisation of CSUs, CCGs, NHS Property Services etc. Because they want to pursue their ideology above everything else, they're leaving things to chance at a local level. For example - NHS PS were ill-though out and not really formed in a condition to take over the running of premises. They have no financial authorisation for capital spend at present unless you go all the way to the higher echelons of senior management. The CCGs are still trying to understand who is providing what, and the CSUs were only given half the responsibilities of the previous PCTs whilst the remaining responsibilities drift between entities with no management (eg IT, Patient Transport, Telecoms etc).


From a reforms perspective I think the previous system OR the new system could be effective, but they need effective governance and to be well conceived. The nurses at the ground floor are always well meaning but you still need a good degree of governance to ensure patient care is held to a high standard and risks are managed accordingly. The CQC in that regards needs to be a strongly invested arm of the NHS and one which keeps all providers on its toes. At the moment people are too bogged down in ideologies rather than considering how they can make it work.

I then spend about 20,000 of the remaining money during the course of the year. 12,000 is on rent. so the remaining 8,000 I pay 20% tax on. I pay a few more bits like car tax, council tax.

So ballpark figure I pay about £14,500 tax a year.

What do I take?

Roads. I use them every day.

Doctor. Been to the doc once in the last year for a checkup.

Dentist, been to the dentist once this year.

Police. I haven't been mugged, so they are doing their job.

Amenities (parks etc.). This is covered by my council tax.

All in all I think I pay more into the system than I get out of it.

I think it is quite interesting looking at the previous UK government and the current one. The previous one did a lot of very popular things, but was ultimately running the whole country into the ground as a direct result. The current one conversely does very few popular things but has the country's long term health at the centre of their beliefs.    

I am not a tory voter, and don't agree with everything the current government has done. But like them or hate them you have to admit that they have done *some* unpopular but much needed things while being in power.

I mean, to put things in perspective. The guidelines state a taser can be used if officers are threatened with imminent violence. Would that not be exactly the same guideline for gun usage? Any imminent violence can result in death, no? When violence occurs it seems to me that prediction of who pulls out a knife and who might not becomes impossible. All violence is potentially life threatening.

If the excuse to use a taser is merely the threat of violence, what is to stop the argument that they should have guns to defend themselves?

We don't give officers guns because they're lethal, and we prefer that officers place themselves in harm's way in the line of duty because pacification of violence without potentially lethal harm is better than deaths.

Given that a taser is a potentially lethal weapon, why then do we overlook the same logic? I don't see why they should have them over guns. Not that I'm advocating for an armed police force, merely that I don't really see a huge difference between an officer pulling one potentially lethal weapon or another, where upon discharge of the weapon the suspect may or may not be lethally harmed.

The environment caused the rapidly-decaying neutrons inside the Argon to be quantum-linked to neutrons from Skaro. These neutrons acted as a partial neutralizer to the Huon energy, causing the Doctor to not fully regenerate, and instead his mind was chained to Skaro, and thus the Daleks.

During the later Doctors (Starting around 151, I believe) we find out that, even after the Doctor fully regenerated multiple times, the mental chain was unbroken, granting the Daleks the ability to temporarily seize the Doctor's neural system.

true,Adinnieken,null,null,"Ok, what is tomato sauce then?  I assumed it was ketchup.  Is it like Heinz 57 sauce?  Basically a spicy ketchup?

My point is that here, certain condiments are simply free.  Ketchup, mayo, etc.  If brown sauce was common here, such as A1 Steak Sauce is, it would be available for free where appropriate.  

For instance, you don't walk up to a hot dog vendor in NYC and expect to pay for ketchup, mustard, onions, or relish.  They're various condiments/toppings that people like but they may not be shared by everyone.

Since Heinz 57 isn't a common condiment here, most places don't have it available.  Though in my experience the places that did have it had it available for free.

To be fair, 10p would be synonymous with a US dime.  It's 1/10th the value of the standard currency.  The UK doesn't use 5p or 1p coins anymore, as I recall, so there is no nickeling. :D

You don't get to put your own sauce on your chips?  I could understand if you were topping it with something like chili, cheese, or gravy, the restaurant would add the appropriate amount of topping for the order, but a condiment like a sauce.  We usually get to grab sachets/packets or pump it into little paper or plastic containers, if not directly onto the item.

true,albions-angel,null,null,"This is not surprising to me in the least. I was recently part of a public speaking comp where we were given motions to speak on. Me and my partner had to speak for the NHS. Initially we were flustered. Who, after all, thinks its working? But the more we dug the more we found that actually, the cases of it not working are few and far between. They hit the news, every time, BECAUSE they are so rare.

As a company, its screwed to all hell. Its got bogged down in admin, noone knows what the hell they are doing and hospitals that were vital to communities are being shut down because it makes sense ""on paper"".

But the service of care? Well it works for 99% of the people 99% of the time... for free... providing some of the best healthcare in the world... with some of the most talented GPs and Surgeons in the world. Our medical degrees are some of the most rigorous in europe, our codes of conduct equally so. Countries want to have the NHS, but cant figure out how to implement it without extreme cost to its people, and all because for a national health care system, its actually efficient for its size. 

Yeah there are problems. There always are in organisations like that. And sometimes people fall under the radar. Our Social Services are appallingly badly equipped, but our hospitals, surgeries, dental practices and the rest just work. If you can get past the reception staff (who are just ticking the boxes they have been told to) you usually get acceptable treatment, and its often even exceptional. 

I for one am glad that we have it. It needs some improvements, but as of right now, its fairly good. It was set up at the perfect economic time and has weathered well. It makes up the backbone of one of the best welfare systems in the world, and it does it almost flawlessly every time. 

And as Julie Walters once said on ""dinnerladies"", you are free to laps into any length of coma without worrying about running up a big bill!

EDIT: Oh, and I remember one titbit. If I recall correctly, the only other group to have more employees than the NHS is the Chinese Red Army.

Well don't post 'lmgtfy' links when people aren't asking stupid questions. You could just have easily put the wiki link up for Bitcoin instead.

&gt;Cash is not easier for a transaction as you have to be there in person or trust another person to send and receive it on your behalf one way or another.

I should have said I meant in person for that bit. Fair problems with using cash when not face to face though.

&gt;Whilst I obviously can't give you a definitive number, a lot do and eBay is in talks currently in regards to accepting bitcoin.

It will be interesting to see who else joins in with accepting Bitcoin once eBay have started and shown it to be a good business idea.

Right now, I don't see the point for me. I don't worry about privacy that much as all they'll see is that my buying history is mainly full of aviation related books, with a few larger tech purchases here and there. For everyone else, it does only seem to hold appeal to those who are very cautious about their privacy. Personally I'm more interested in how Bitcoin can keep such a high exchange rate beyond there being a hard limit on the number of Bitcoin's that will be in circulation. Also the security of it doesn't seem the best so far.

I would reverse it. No more than 100 days out of a single year at Whitehall unless in exceptional times. No less than 150 days in their home constituencies. During that time, they must attend ALL local council meetings and must hold no fewer than 5 ""question time"" events for the public to voice their own motions. All motions that garner 50% or more of a vote at one of these events must be brought up at the next commons meeting. Yes, that could take forever, but it is important. 

PM, Cabinet and Shadow Cabinet are exempt from the time constraints for the duration of their term in office. No individual may be in the cabinet or Shadow Cabinet for more than 8 years out of every 10, but may serve as many terms as they like (basically, only one term in office before a break) unless they are PM. 

Keep the lords more or less as is, but make it up of experts. Sometimes the experts are the Landed Gentry. They have after all been raised to become Lords and know what they are doing.

Make the civil service smaller. Its too large. My father deals with the MOD now for BFBS. Its hell trying to get them to do anything quickly and there is no need for it. They all want spotless records so they can ""rotate"" to something better in 3 years time, which makes dealing with them difficult. Any ease you have built up with one department is removed after they rotate. They are part of a service. Not a career hike. 

And finally, and this may seem extreme, to be considered for PM or Cabinet, you must have completed ""residency"", a 6 month stint, without your family, in the current poorest area of the country, in council accommodation on minimum wage or minimum benefits. During residency, your only expenses are for travel to and from London and utilities used by any security detail you may have. 

I have many many more but most deal with transparency, making expenses records available to the public, allowing on line referendums on many more issues (unless important, the outcome would be advisory), better order in the commons (actually expelling members for heckling. Let the guy speak. If you disagree, wait your turn damn it!) and some other things. I actually wrote a constitution when I was 16. I got cross watching BBC Commons or whatever its called and so spent the summer studying the US Constitution, the Magna Carter and the UK and US political systems. Most of this stuff is from there.

true,k-dude,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,"Trials aren't to absolve people of any blame. Otherwise we would have to keep people indefinitely detained until their innocence was proven. I know you are trying to defend the rights of the defendant, and as a defence solicitor in training ;) I think that that is admirable, but you are actually doing the opposite. 

In this country, there is no compulsion to prove innocence on the behalf of the defendant. Their and their lawyer's only responsibility is to ensure that there is a reasonable doubt that they are not guilty - the threshold that the Crown must overcome to deprive them of their liberty. 

Just as there wasn't enough evidence to prove that he raped her, there is not enough evidence to prove that the allegation is completely false, so she cannot be found guilty of this and he cannot sue her for damaging his reputation. In the modern world of forensics and fingerprints and CCTV, we can often get tricked into thinking that every case is black or white and that it is always possible to know whether an accused is completely innocent or completely guilty, but in reality most cases are greyish and in between (particularly in cases like this when the only evidence we can validate is the legitimacy and honesty of one persons testament against an other). 

That is why the whole principle of 'not guilty' is a wonderful thing. It protects the innocent by making the prosecution jump over several hurdles to prove someone guilty of a crime. I think it is admirable that until guilt is proven you think that we shouldn't ostracised the accused, but I fail to see how you aren't applying your own principle to the girl in question, who is also, as of now, not guilty.",0,1378837644,null,0,1378837824,0,cc5mnas,t3_1m3tfl,t1_cc5mnas,t1_cc5l5z0,null,1429510994,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

I couldn't stand their attitude, their whining, etc. Then I started watching Spurs, and fell in love with the club and their supporters.

Another thing: as an American, one of the things that gives European football (as opposed to MLS soccer) a huge appeal is the tradition and history behind the clubs. We don't have that sense of history; even with baseball our teams only go back a century, and that's a select few that still exist. My ancestors, eastern European Jews, immigrated to New York in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Based on where they came from and where they settled, I figured out once by looking through immigration documents that if they had stopped in Britain instead of America, chances are they'd have ended up with the Jews in East London who gave Spurs the ""Yid"" moniker — other people from their *shtetls* ended up in those parts of London.

I'm not in the mood to be a teacher and I often find people learn it themselves with independent learning rather than having someone they don't know attempt to explain it to them.

&gt;I should have said I meant in person for that bit. Fair problems with using cash when not face to face though.

You can use paper wallets which are handy. http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1c9xr7/psa_using_paper_wallets_understanding_change/

&gt;Right now, I don't see the point for me. I don't worry about privacy that much as all they'll see is that my buying history is mainly full of aviation related books, with a few larger tech purchases here and there. For everyone else, it does only seem to hold appeal to those who are very cautious about their privacy. Personally I'm more interested in how Bitcoin can keep such a high exchange rate beyond there being a hard limit on the number of Bitcoin's that will be in circulation. Also the security of it doesn't seem the best so far. There have been far to many incidents of companies suffering Bitcoin thefts, and there seems to be few of the protections available when compared to buying with a credit card.

I don't use it for anything pedestrian, currently. I only really use it for gambling and other things. In regards to thefts, that's usually from hackers or people having utterly wank security. Which can also happen to paypal or cash etc

Had the later police investigation known about the earlier reports, they would have lent more credibility and a prosecution would probably have been made.

But the requirement for corroboration does contribute to making sexual crimes difficult to prosecute in Scotland. It's one of the reasons we have an extremely low conviction rate for rape. Removing the requirement for corroboration will undoubtedly make it easier to prosecute sexual offences.

However, I'm a long way from convinced that the right way to deal with the problem is to remove rights from accused people. Especially in the way the Scottish government plans to do so, which does not provide sufficient safeguards for the accused.

true,KarmaAndLies,null,null,"&gt; You've just pushed the problem of effective representation elsewhere.    

The lords wouldn't represent representation as they aren't elected they're appointed.     

&gt; Who watches the watchmen, who picks the pickers?    

The nice part is that the lords would be from such a diverse set of areas it is very difficult to pick too many of the same ""kind.""    

Plus you could make it so the selections process is quite open and transparent. Put a punch of criteria down on paper like ""contributions to the field,"" and it will be even harder still to game the system.    

Now nothing is beyond abuse, and this is no exception, but at least the abuse would be politically independent of the main government which is the whole point anyway (i.e. it could be corrupt, but who is to say that a corrupt lords wouldn't counterbalance a corrupt commons anyway?).   

Keep in mind that like now the HoL has less power than the HoC. Ultimately the commons runs the country, the lords makes ""suggestions"" and helps keep an eye on the commons.   

The commons are like a bunch of children, the lords are the childminders, letting them play but ultimately stopping them from running into traffic or setting fire to the curtains. 

&gt; Come on though, you have to scrap the name!    

Why? In my system lords is a very appropriate name. They're the best and brightest from their selected fields (or near enough). These should be people who have respect before they sit, so the title reflects their standing within their field.    

&gt; History seems clear that the democratic form of representation is random lots, not elite proxies.    

Yet my system is still ""less bad"" than the current ones. I won't pretend it is a perfect system or completely immune from abuse, because obviously that's crazy. But it is ""less bad."" And less bad is all we can really hope for.   

The lords under my system is mildly less democratic than the current one, but in principle I'd have no issue with mixing in a few randomly elected lords just for counterbalance (although they too would have to be politically neutral, no proxy political wars in the HoL).

true,DmcDT,,Belfast,"* Protip - Lie (slightly). Apply for positions above your grade / expected level for interview experience.
* Be wary of internships. I knew that 3 years ago when I graduated there where many offering 4 week apprenticeships / interships that might look good on paper for experience, but often when you get the job the internship will extend to a 6 month unpaid role. You cannot support yourself on this.
* Look for Bridge2Employment courses. Might be worth considering taking up a job in an industry you never planned on being in like IT etc, as its experience and pay none the less.
* Dont just apply to one position and put your eggs in one basket, apply to everything. Its not just you against everyone that graduated this year, but more than likely over the last 2 to 3 years too. The amount of graduate / entry level interviews I sat where I was up against guys with 20yrs experience actually shocked me. Its a bad time for jobs everywhere, for everyone.
* I dont care if you rolled out of Queens etc with a 1st and a glowing reccomendation from the Chancellor, your degree is literally the pre-requisite that gets your foot in the door to an interview. You need experience, and personal skills to wow the interviewer and show them you will be a valued asset. Dont be afraid to tell them this is not the job you had in mind, but that your skill set still applies and you are flexible enough to take on the challenges
* Dont limit your job search to just ""Graduate"" roles. Lots of places advertise as ""entry level"" instead with little to no experience required.
* Jobfinder NI / NIJobs.com / RecruitNI / Monster are all your friends. Get draughting that CV now, and have a few cover letters that can easily be applied and or changed to any job to make your search easier. Its easy to see ""write a covering letter"" and think, aw fuck this, im not applying, when Ctrl+V will potentially do the work for you.

true,fluffy_cat,eng-GreaterLondon,London,"I don't the the comparison between someone bringing a camera and CCTV is fair. If someone walks up to you filming it indicates a few things: they are filming you for private use (creepy), they may be intending to provoke you into doing something on film, they are actively trying to film *you* which can make you anxious or nervous, and you don't necessarily know the purpose of their filming.

Meanwhile, a CCTV camera is constantly recording, meaning they are attempting to deter crime/trespassing or to catch someone in the act. They are not filming *you* specifically, only a certain area which you might happen to be in.

Hence I think it is a ridiculous to say ""If you don't mind a CCTV camera filming you, why do you mind me filming you?"".

true,NeoNerd,scot-Aberdeen,Aberdeenshire,"Well, first off, I'm very sorry to hear what happened to you. I really hope that you're doing well now. You obviously have a perspective on this that I couldn't possibly understand. 

I can say that multiple similar accusations can be used to corroborate each other in Scotland. It's known as the Moorov doctrine. I'd also say that prosecution years after the fact is possible in Scotland, depending on circumstances. It really depends on what has happened.

As for the rest, rights was perhaps a poor way of putting it. The requirement for corroboration is a protection for the accused from inappropriate prosecution and wrongful conviction. The view is taken that there must be significant safeguards to prevent wrongful conviction. 

The Bill to remove corroboration does not introduce the same level of protection for accused people as currently exists. At the moment is introduces one safeguard - the number of jurors needed to convict will rise from 8/15 to 10/15. 

The Law Society believes that (should corroboration be removed) it should be 12/15. They also beleive that extra tests should be introduced before prosecution to make sure that evidence is strong. At the moment, Scotland has less safeguards at this stage because evidence must be corroborated.

I'm not inherently opposed to changing the law, just opposed to doing it in a way that reduced safeguards against miscarriages of justice.

The modern series attempted to put a definitive mark on it by saying that he was 900 years old, but both throughout the original series and in Moffat's run, the Doctor presents wildly varying answers to the question of his age, with the earliest being in ""Tomb of the Cybermen"" during his second incarnation, where he says that he's roughly 450 years old. 

I think that might be accurate, but from then onwards, it's a mystery. At one point he claims he's thousands of years old, at another 750, and at another, during the Seventh Doctor's run, he stated that he was 953.

The essential problem I see in society is economic inequality, quality of life, share of national wealth, lack of land access (unless you have a double barrelled name), lack of oversight, a de facto privatised/unionised† military, global finance, tax havens, lack of transparency at a political institutional level.

† I call it both privatised because it's largely a corporation that accounts to nobody but itself (parliament can indeed be skipped and wars waged). GCHQ is an arm of that and we know they are up to some dirty shit more than willing with the Americans. I also call it unionised because it never really saw the dismantling other sectors received (it gets preferential access to education, benefits, schooling, asset insurance eg' Cyprus, and an endless supply of lobbyists to promote funding/general welfare, etc). Any contingent block of workers is a threat because it has power over the economy, where as fragmented contractors and small businesses means industrial action is usually self harm, of limited scope and there is always a ~~scabby~~ competing contractor.

Speeds at least where I've been living (mostly Stranmillis area) have been consistently high since the network upgrade last year. 

Back at my mum's house, she's currently on BT for over a year after over a decade with Orange (originally Wanadoo). So far BT have been quite disappointing and have broken promises made during the sign up process (they promised she'd have BT Infinity by the end of the year, while they've upgraded the telephone exchange she's connected to they've yet to upgrade her nearest 'green box'). Despite the slow speeds they are much better than Orange. Orange were terrible, tech support useless, issues took weeks/months to resolve, supplied hardware was always breaking. Only reason she didn't transfer sooner was that she didn't want the hassle. She finally caved and moved when the connection died for three months and Orange didn't try anything to fix it.

true,thetasigma4,tom-baker,Tom Baker,I would reccomend Genesis of the Daleks. It may be quite drawn out but it is almost constantly voted as one of the best ever stories. It gives the origin of Davros and the Daleks ( introduces interesting moral dilemmas such as if the doctor has the right to commit genocide and the beliefs of Davros as that one being being omnipotent and the only living thing. This also goes great with the audio Davros which introduces more why he thinks like that (which is superb but the lesson about that can be summarised into basically he thinks the most peacful method of leaving the Galaxy is to have only one being which is controlled centrally) (i think). However from the new series Midnight might be good ( interesting monster shows humanitys reaction to fear and lack of understanding of a different life form( i would say this is good because it its the only 10th doc episode I like ( there is another (human nature) but that is based off a book so i am not sure if it is as good as the book and i would like to judge it based on the source material) and 11th hour for an introduction into Doctor Who. You might also want to show the comedic touch of Doctor Who in which case I would go for City of Death as that is hilarious (it has some superb lines some examples http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Fourth_Doctor#City_of_Death_.5B17.2.5D) and has some interesting concepts such as the being split through time. It was written by Douglas Adams (mostly) so if you like Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy you may like this and think it worth exhibiting.

true,Chivalrous_Gentleman,null,null,"In my opinion there are several problems with compulsory military service. The main reason is that you get a far more motivated, capable and flexible fighting force if you recruit from volunteers. By selecting (and that selection process is important, which you don't get with everyone compulsorily having to serve) from a pool of volunteers, the start point for the very expensive military training cycle has already weeded out those who are not committed to the whole process in the first place. No one wants to fight with someone who doesn't want to be there and who isn't as committed as they are themselves. It doesn't lend to cohesive team that you need to be successful in combat. I suppose you could restrict the roles that conscripts are placed into from the higher stress and higher risk combat roles, but given the ever more asymmetric nature of modern and future conflict, it is becoming harder and harder to define what is a combat role and what isn't. Combat Logistic Patrols in Afghanistan constitute a much higher proportion of ground manoeuvre than most people imagine (dull as they generally tend to be) for example.

There are other reasons too: military training cannot be selective if everyone HAS to do it. Military training is pretty expensive, and compulsory service is therefore very inefficient. There is a significant swathe of the population who are simply not suitable for military service. 

All of these reasons however pale into insignificance in comparison to the fact that the military simply does not need that many soldiers, especially ones who would be (relatively speaking) less experienced and less well trained. The Army is current in the middle of removing 22000 jobs and roles by 2020, whilst attempting to hang on to the talent and the quality (with arguable success).",0,1378851518,null,0,false,0,cc5s14x,t3_1m19qq,t1_cc5s14x,t1_cc5dym2,null,1429508354,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Villas - Boas to the new monaco side
we would have hired either David Moyes or Rafa Benitez

I dont think we would have sold van der vaart in either of those two managers, but since AVB wants youth and to rejuvinate the club we sold VdV

Bale would have had a good season, but not outstanding like last season. because a key part of why he was so good was due to AVB playing the team to his strengths

I'd be suspicious of the Recruitment agencies myself, unless you are literally wanting any job that comes up. 

For a lot of them, their job isn't to place you in the perfect job, it's to get a seat filled for a client for at least six months so they get their commission.

One nameless agency once tried to convince me that a job doing nothing but VB6 programming (long dead, and horrid technology), strict 8:30 to 5:30 working day, for less pay than I was on, was a great opportunity that would be better than what I had. Nope. (and they phoned up a friend the same day offering the same thing. Nope again, and he *was* actually unhappy with his job at the time).

I've heard it's better when you've a decent relationship with an individual recruiter, but after my first experiences I think it's better to approach the companies directly.

""Nearly all were arrested for alleged offences under sections 12 and 14 of the Public Order Act. ""

Looking at the link provided on this text, its apparent this refers to the time and the route the march can move. 

Now when we consider the post yesterday about the march setting off 15 minutes too early, its pretty obvious just what the issue was here.

But lets not leave it there. Lets look under the ""peacefully assembling"" link and look at the first paragraph.

""Scuffles broke out as demonstrators tried to break through police lines to confront a march of the English Defence League (EDL) in the City of London.""

So in reality the ""peaceful protesters"" were in fact trying to force their way through police lines and physically confront EDL protesters. Which is wonderfully Ironic that a group opposed to Fascism, would use a rather fascist technique to stop free speech.

Track replacement crews a few years ago found some sections of rail that had been in use since 1930. Nor were any of these companies particularly punctual. In the 25 years of LMS' existence, they only ever refurbished *one* station (Derby), even though most of their stations were 70-80 years old by that point, and any other work since then has been piecemeal at best, meaning the problem has been shunted (sorry) forward to today, where we have the situation where we either spend big or are forced to give up and shut down the network.

By the late 1980s, BR was *losing* over half a million pounds *per day*. Private ownership didn't ever work (only the SR ever got past 10% profit, and only for a couple of years), nationalisation didn't work, and right now we're trying a third way that is showing promise, but the failures of the past mean that we have to throw money at the problem.

Rose tint is all very well, but more people daily use the network today than ever have in the past.

Unfortunately, most teams these days sit back very deep against us, making it hard for us to get in behind them.  Also, AVB's use of inverted wingers lately means that it's doubly difficult, although I imagine part of his thinking there is a reaction to the sitting deep.

The more we threaten in the middle of the pitch, and the more we get our central midfielders to move and rotate creatively around the top of the box, the more the opposition defence will be forced to step up, and the more space we'll have in behind them to get the ball to Bobby.

~~Download here!~~ Nevermind...

They've also been up on Redbubble for awhile now (which I won't link to, since it's against the rules), so if I've already taken down the file by the time you see this, you can search for them there. 

And I gotta say, I didn't expect such a great response. You all sure know how to inflate an ego!

Edit: Seriously guys, I've never had much much confidence in my design skills, so your comments are truly overwhelming. BEST FANDOM EVER.

And if you do hang these up somewhere, I'd love to see a picture!

Edit 2: My public Dropbox has been disabled because of excessive traffic. Good job guys! I've uploaded it to Mediafire instead.

I *really* need some sleep now, so if you've sent me a message, I'll reply in the morning.

true,fragglet,null,null,"I think the key factor is whether privatising will provide any actual marketplace competition. A good example in the past few years has been the privatisation of the directory enquiries services - there's actual competition between companies that ultimately leads to better customer service. Sure, the 118 118 adverts are annoying, but things are better than they were a few years ago.

With trains there's no competition: if - for example - you hate First Great Western (as I do) then travelling on a different company's trains makes no real difference. Most tickets are just ""any route"" tickets to a particular destination. Sure, you *can* book seats in advance on particular trains, but most people don't, so it makes no difference.

The only real ""competition"" exists in government oversight and in bidding for contracts. At best it's kind of a fake substitute for a real marketplace. The train companies know how to play the system to get as much money out of it as they can.

Same is true of the other things you mention: how can there be ""competition"" for water, when ultimately it all goes through the same pipes?

That said, with auto enrolment pensions where-by employers HAVE to contribute, giving up some of your income can be very beneficial, as the company also puts in.

Basically though, the earlier you start, the less you (theoretically) need to put in due to compounding over many years. So £1000 over 50 years at 5% suddenly becomes nearly £11,500.

true,EatYurSaladDave,,Belfast,"Ok, here it goes, my guide to going to Queens. I'm going to tell you everything I enjoyed and thought was worth it, but it's subjective and you'll find yourself your own ways and ideas.

**Living**:
You say your staying in Elms, good choice, it is easily the best place to meet new friends that could potentially be your's for the rest of your uni life, and beyond. That said, as already covered, never leave your card down, I think they cost to get replaced and eventually you get a steep fine if you go over a certain amount. 

The 24 hour spar is the nearest place to you to get food, although Tesco is a short walk away and use that for all your food needs. The nearest off license is beside the Bot. Unless your a good cook, buy cheapish and easy to make food, and always tidy up, no one likes the person who leaves a mess. Same goes the morning after a night out.

**Food**: Eating out is expensive, and probably best avoided if you want to save money, or budget is tight already. That said, Maggies is the holy grail of student food in Belfast, but over time I've grown out of it, same old same old. The Elms bar, just down the road from Queens SU does a great £5 meal deal with drink, personal favourite is the cowboy supper, but I haven't had a bad meal there yet. Also, the SU itself has seriously up'd it's quality of food over the past year, and is not a bad option either for cheap decent food.

If you want something a little more up market (say its a birthday) Maddisons on Botanic avenue has a £10 two course set menu which is exceptional value considering the state of the place. Also on Botanic is Carletto's Italian restaurant, which is more expensive but also great for splashing out. 

**Drink**: Now this is entirely subjective, and best to just figure out on your own, but I'll tell you some places that do deals etc Maddisons (as mentioned before) do a 5pm - 9pm £3 cocktail deal, they are all very well trained at making them, and it is always a good place to start off a night. However, around the corner, is The Fly, they have the same deal on all day, until 11pm, they are owned by the same company, it is quieter, but the quality of the drink isn't as good. 

I can't remember what night, I think Tuesday, the Box has a £1 a drink offer, Limelight on a Tuesday also has very good drink deals if your into rockish music. Union on Monday can be good value if you stick with there offers, and offers a mix match of music. I do enjoy the Bot downstairs on a Wednesday when they have a cover band downstairs who are top quality. The Hatfield also plays traditional Irish music live a load of nights, and if you enjoy that, really go there for a night or two. 

**Uni Life**: Join clubs and societies that you like, go to the freshers fair and take details of everything you might want to join. I've been in a fair few of them, and never have been disappointed. Most are well organised and very social. Also, best way to meet people outside of elms and your class imo. Secondly, look up degree plus. It's an add on to your degree that proves you put yourself out there on other topics, such as the clubs, but also charity, sports, pretty much anything sensible. 

There is so much at the uni to do I can't even begin to actually describe most of it, put yourself out there and you'll get a lot back is all I can really say.

Also, you asked about a park to run in in another comment, Botanic Gardens is probably too small for a run, instead, turn out of Elms to the left, follow that road to Stranmillis, from there you can either turn up Stranmillis road and do a small block around via the Ashby building, or you can go further along the river bank, up Ormeau Road and back up to elms from there, during daylight at least it is totally safe, even during the night I wouldn't be feared.

I went to the trail and spoke to the judge before saying the ones under 18 should not go to jail but under the condition i sit down and meet with them.

we spent about 3-4hours discussing why they did it and how they at the age of 16-17 there lives could be ruined ect... 

The youngest one now has a child and is a qualified plumber and the other is in college.

the oldest one was dealt with in other ways and is an addict living the other side of the country.

true,Rohaq,eng-Cambridgeshire,Cambridgeshire,"Got to agree here; almost all of the care I've received from the NHS has been fair, reasonable, and of acceptable quality; from the time I badly broke my arm when I was 12, to the time I was diagnosed with a lifelong condition at the age of 17, to the time I came back into the UK two weeks ago on a Friday evening whilst going through a flareup, realised I was going to run out of meds before I could re-register with a GP and get an appointment on the Monday, and so I grabbed a bus and casually walked into the local A&amp;E first thing on a Sunday morning to ask for an emergency appointment with a doctor to extend my prescription and prevent my condition from getting worse.

Waiting times are generally what I'd expect - walking into A&amp;E on a Sunday morning, I was seen within an hour, for a previous flareup in a busy London hospital when I was travelling a couple of years ago, it took them over 4 hours to get to me, but quite frankly, they were busydealing with serious patients, whilst I was purely in pain. Staff were generally attentive and polite, the care I received was spot on, and I think the best part of it is that aside from fixed prescription costs (and obviously the taxes I pay), it was completely free. I didn't have to sit there worrying about going into debt for the sake of a hospital visit, or sitting at home hoping that the pain would just go away (hint: it wouldn't have, my condition could have got far, far worse, and I may have ended up in hospital anyway) because I didn't want to deal with a huge medical bill coming my way, or having to deal with private insurance companies, or whether that insurance would cover what I needed, because everybody receives the same level of care.

The NHS isn't perfect, and there's always room for improvement, but even in its current state, I'd say that it's doing a pretty good job.

That's not to say thatI haven't had some bad experiences, but most of the time that's been down to individual members of staff, rather than the system as a whole.",0,1378866374,null,0,false,0,cc5xac0,t3_1m3eq7,t1_cc5xac0,t1_cc5e84c,null,1429505902,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Captain Jack Harkness said he was a Time Agent, and therefore capable of time travel(hence the space ship during world war II) So I suppose there's others, who end up meddling with ""time"" and the doctor goes and fixes it.

Fishing for extra evidence surely cannot justify ruining a persons career, reputation and life. 

And surely, once the police/media have said ""Hey we're investigating [A Celebrity] for child sex offences from fifty years ago, if he abused you too, come forward and we'll add you to our list""; then evidence from anyone who comes forward after that statement has got to carry very little weight at all.

Sure they might be a genuine victim who had been scared to come forward.  But maybe they're an attention seeker, or misremembering, or hoping there will be class action compensation claims, or are just plain vindictive.  

Once the celebrity is named and shamed he just becomes such an easy target for fake accusations that even genuine accusations must get lost in the mix. 

I just don't think the potential for evidence to be gained can justify the very real, and certain damage that will be done to the innocent (until proven guilty) party.

No, they didn't. It was the ""loyalists"" who specialised in targeting civilians, often with the cooperation and collusion of the British army, the police and the intelligence services.

Some economists, however, have taken the time to quantify the destructive nature of Africa’s national borders. Authors Stelios Michalopoulos and Elias Papaioannou have released a new working paper showing how arbitrary border decisions have affected war and civil unrest in Africa, particularly among split ethnic groups and their neighbors. Not surprisingly, the length of a conflict and its casualty rate is 25 percent higher in areas where an ethnicity is divided by a national border as opposed to areas where ethnicities have a united homeland

I think the biggest change you need to make is to sell yourself more by removing some of the negative parts you put about yourself - you don't want to tell your employer your downsides because everyone else that is applying for a job sure as hell won't! So i'd remove the part about getting familiar with keyboards, the bit in communication where you say 'nowhere near perfect'. 'not relevant to my skills' , 'though i am not confident when new and unfamiliar territory.' Basically, saying all of these is just filler and negative filler at that. The part where you say 'If hired, you would be providing me with...' makes you sound a bit desperate.

The biggest section I would expand upon would be the Barnados part. You've given a short list of what you did, but it should be easy to expand upon - 'Customer Service' could be 'I regularly interacted with customers in a polite and friendly way, developing a rapport with regular visitors to the shop,' and 'fetch/carry and gofer work' 'After completing a manual handling course, I moved stock between the front of house and the stockroom.' (As every colunteering job i've ever had has had manual handling training so I imagine you have?)
'Shop floor cleaning' could be 'I rearranged stock on the shelves in order to provide  aesthetically pleasing and uncluttered displays.'

It's important to remember that shit, jobs are hard, so it's important to sell yourself as much as possible.

Broadly, feminists would argue that, even though such policies obviously advantage women in money terms, they still arise from the same old gender stereotypes - clubs marketing themselves to high value male customers with big disposable incomes, 'cool' credibility or fame, using the number of attractive young women they can attract as the lure.

You've given no indication of what you *want* to do and that doesn't help us help you.

To add to what /u/doom-halo has already said (and assuming you don't want to flip burgers for life....):

* The cover letter needs re-written for every application. Make it pertinent to the position, highlight sections of your CV that are relevant and maybe add in extra detail that's not on the CV.
* Fix the grammatical errors, especially after you've just claimed to have a good grasp of the language! e.g. ""superiors"" is better than ""higher-up[s]"".
* The entire CV is too casual. Re-write it in less chatty and more formal language.
* Highest qualifications first (not lowest).
* Can you drive? Do you have a passport? I have to assume the answers here are ""No"".
* You were unemployed for 2 years. What did you do? You said you write, did you get anything published? Join a writing group? Start a blog? Anything. You need to show you were active.

What can you do now?

* Clear up your data leakage. I can't search Facebook like /u/doom_halo, but ""NottinghamOtter"" clashes with a few odd accounts - so get a separate email for job hunting. edit: Oh dear god - the ""odd accounts"" are yours!
* Kick in some doors. Simply rock up at a place you'd like to work and ask. Can't hurt. And if you *really* want to work there, keep rocking up and keep asking.
* Get the trade mag for an industry you're interested in and scan for the entry positions (my guess is you are doing this already).
* Bug seven hells out of the Job Centre. They have training courses available, get on one that suits you.
* Where have you posted your CV? Are you on **every** job site in the UK? If not, why not?
* Are you registered with every agency? If not, why not?
* Be prepared to move.
* Get qualified. This is slightly beyond just bugging the Job Centre, I'm thinking college/uni courses. These do cost but as you are unemployed you may qualify for grants. Time to start checking this out.
* Is there any way you can leverage your work on Aesira into the CV or cover letter? e.g. if you were applying for a role with ""Games Workshop"" or a place like ""Chimera""?

Easy jobs to get:

* If you have a moped license and can read map - pizza delivery. I used to do this as a second job. The pay is minimum wage, but the tips can make up for it (please, always tips the delivery person - even a tiny bit. It makes their miserable existence a little less horrible).
* Telesales. It can be high-pressure and you need to hit targetw. I've done this as well, I hated it. You may like it, all depends on how you are wired. There is a high attrition rate, so there are always openings.

true,lipeu,essex,Essex,"&gt; Many Transsexual's fly out to Thailand for their surgery, it is regarded as the best place to go for the most cost effective care and using the latest surgical techniques in that regard. I'm sure if you poke your nose in to those areas of reddit you'll find a small army all saying Thailand's better than the NHS.

You can still get this operation for free on the NHS. The techniques I can't comment on, but I wouldn't imagine any surgeon worth their salt would use any technique that was outdated or not effective. Thailand is an option for those that the NHS can't fund certainly, but I'm proud to live somewhere that acknowledges that this issue is not a choice, and though the funding is difficult to get, it IS still available.

&gt; The NHS in it's current understaffed, mismanaged and abused state is good for coughs, colds, sniffles and broken bones. Not a lot else. Don't expect them to treat you if you are over 50 or have something quite 'interesting' wrong with you.

Umm, no. Coughs, colds and sniffles are viral, and generally wont get you anything from the nhs except advice. (and some GPs will be happy to prescribe you paracetamol for 7-odd quid)
Over 50s take up a huge part of the NHS budget, I would say the majority, I think you can realise that your statement with regards to that is entirely wrong, if you literally spend a minute in A&amp;E or a GP waiting room.

From my experience the most interesting patients get a lot of, well, interest from the specialists. You've experienced a failure in communication between hospitals unfortunately. Also, depending on what your condition is, the more unusual, the less likely there is to be a good treatment for it, and sometimes there just isn't anything else to be done. I think communication issues between different hospitals/community care, are to blame for a lot of errors and dissatisfaction within the NHS. I obviously don't know what your issue is but I can only guess that you've been ""lost in the system"". As far as doctors lying... take them to the GMC if that is what has really happened. Please make a complaint. Incompetent docs or those with bad practice should be made aware that they are not satisfying their duty of care to patients and the GMC should be made aware too so they can be investigated, and patients can be safe.

I do understand that there are flaws with the system, and unfortunately there are healthcare professionals out there that are lazy, or don't care enough, but most do care, and are trying to do their best. I hate the propaganda that's being spread, because privatization is NOT the answer, and it is being pushed so hard that I can't imagine it's for any other reason than for a lot of politicians financial gain. Everyone will be sad when its A&amp;E for free and the rest you can whistle for, because you can bet your unusual problem won't be covered to even be looked at under any standard insurance.

Shariah courts exist legally to deal with internal issues within Muslim families, like marriage, divorce, and some sort of guidance.  However alot overstep their bounds by issuing decrees to their followers that replace the UK legal alternative.  There is a short BBC documentary about it here:

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22044724

I've been a Muslim most of my life and I have seen clerics in the UK giving ""advice"" which is always guised under the ""you either do this or you'll be punished by god"" phrasing.  This is usually enough to force alot of obedient Muslims to favour these courts over the civil law in the UK.  

Be that as it may, the article does not focus on these courts (even with the title) as much as the Lib Dem MP and his behaviour towards an ex-Muslim who escaped Sudan to take refuge in the UK.  But I'm guessing that okay for you since you'll probably call it cultural and it's racist and Islamophobic to be critical of him.

Edit:  Your edit which added the two links confirmed what I said above.  Being critical of Islam is equated to racism for you.
