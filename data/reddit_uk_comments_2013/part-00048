true,alexgmcm,eng-sussex,Sussex,"I'm the same age as you:

&gt;Benefits have been way too high. People have been living off benefits with no incentive to work. An attempt to change this has been made at the worst possible time.

I disagree. The only place I think benefits are too generous is with teenage parents - but then they are effectively holding their children hostage and short of placing the children into care it is hard to see what can be done. So whilst it is wrong, it is a complicated issue.

Normal benefits are quite low.

&gt;Millionaire bankers have wrecked the economy.

A somewhat simplistic view but I agree with the gist of it given the massive shift in wealth to the higher end dominated by the 'Masters of the Universe' in Financial Services, and the mismanagement of Libor, Liar's loans etc. But ultimately people took mortgages and loans who shouldn't have so there is a certain amount of personal responsibility as well.

&gt;Government doesn't have a fucking clue.

What does this even mean? I agree they aren't representative of normal people, largely due to the rise of career politicians and a dominance of those from wealthy backgrounds.

&gt;At the same time young people were pushed into degrees, they were massively devalued.

They are devalued because everyone wants to do media or psychology or something sexy, a hard engineering degree is still pretty useful but not many people want to do those. Again it's more to do with personal responsibility than the government in my opinion - they had a free choice over which degrees to do and were fortunate enough to be offered such an opportunity, they just made stupid decisions.

&gt;Jobs are incredibly hard to get.

I agree, looking at the number of graduate jobs per applicants now compared to prior to the recession is just painful.

&gt;Obtaining your first house is impossible. Renting is the only option.

Again I agree completely, the UK is pretty screwed for this, I worked in Germany during the summers and it's much better there as the rents are actually decent.

&gt;Population (through immigration and previous prosperity) is out of control. Immense pressure on public services such as health and police.

I agree, but short of quasi-fascist measures it's hard to see what can be done.

&gt;The environment is being destroyed. No credible plan for mass renewable energy (unlike Germany who actually have their shit together).

I agree but this is a global issue, and yeah we are kinda screwed, but it's such a large issue it's quite easy to ignore.

Pragmatically though most people aren't interested in politics because it seems so remote - most of the politicians aren't representative of normal people, the choices between parties is basically a choice of the least shit out of 3 shitty parties and yeah it basically seems like it makes no real difference so why bother worrying about it when you can just focus on your day-to-day life where you can have an effect.

true,nixin06,null,null,"In the main part, you are correct.  Young people face a bleak future (and in some ways, you understate how bad it is), and must find a solution.  However, there are some issues.

The first is on benefits.  You write that there is ""no incentive to work"" (I suspect, reciting what is endlessly repeated in the press), then note later (drawing on your own experience) that ""jobs are incredibly hard to get"".  Aren't these connected?  Even if you mean just that *good jobs* are in short supply - this is the real issue, the lack of work worth doing.  Yet, absurdly, there is a vast amount of work to be done rebuilding and modernising the UK's crumbling infrastructure.

Secondly, regarding the population - this is a red herring.  There have been more densely populated countries than today's UK that did not encounter insoluble problems with their public services (say, the Netherlands in the 1960s and 1970s).  Similarly, countries have enjoyed high population growth without any crisis of healthcare (for example, the USA in 1950s and 1960s).

Climate change, the great problem of the environment, this simply can't be solved on a national basis.  The world needs a credible *global* plan, and this will require the free sharing of technical expertise currently stashed away as ""intellectual property"".

On the whole, however, your generation's great problem is the same as those of us who grew up in the 20th Century - a crisis of perspective.

The problem with focusing on your day-to-day life is that you rely on being lucky - not getting sick, not getting into an accident, not getting downsized.

true,RossCoveney,devon,Devon,"Im no economist but there is no doubt to anyone that the Chancellor and the Government have the completely wrong idea, even Tory supporters want deeper cuts and ring-fenced budgets to be ""de-ring-fenced"". As a member of the Labour Party I am also critical of the path chosen by the current government and to some extent my own party with all of the vauge answers and figure spinning. In my opinion growth has to beat deficit reduction in terms of priorities, I dont want to ignore it but by focusing on it you allow the economy to stagnate causing deeper lying problems in the long-term. Investing small amounts now into infrastructure projects, new houses and trying to increase the role of the export market gives people jobs. Simple as that. With people in skilled jobs they pay taxes, and then hopefully in turn that gives the government a surplus which can be used to payback for these projects and tackle the deficit.

The Goverment cling to employment figures as a beacon of success but these jobs dont help contribute to the economy unless they are skilled jobs paying a decent wage giving people excess money to spend. Low payed un-skilled jobs pay in terms of income tax very little and in some cases nothing, the only plus here is that the individual no longer claims JSA. 

The idea of opposing austerity and therefore stimulating growth has been floated around in the last few years by centre-left parties throughout the world although contrary to how the Tories like to spin in it does actually result in lowering the deficit. You do have to borrow a little yes but the stigma of borrowing being the devil has to be avoided to overcome this mess. As I said above investing in all sorts of projects will, if done correctly, result in higher tax returns, proceding to invest that money and repeat the process makes somewhat of a circle of higher and higher investments and returns. Once what you have borrowed to start the cycle of is repaid you can start to reduce the god-forsaken deficit with the surplus, a method that avoids anymore cuts. 

Any economist will no doubt see flaws in my plan, I'm just a sixth-form student with a keen intrest in economics and a few ideas.

true,alexgmcm,eng-sussex,Sussex,"I realise that I'm interested in politics.

But most young people aren't. Especially those busy working and even more so those from 'lower class' backgrounds whose families perhaps have less political engagement anyway. I went to school and am friends with many of those people and I suppose it is a shame as you know that collectively they could achieve a lot, but to be honest the xenophobia and so on displayed by some is frightening but then when you just see immigrants commiting crimes and taking jobs in your local area I guess you would think that way.

I don't blame them - there is no representative choice for them, nor anything that seems to actually be worth the time so they are acting rationally.

And yeah, my mum is disabled and therefore the current war on the vulnerable has a major effect on her life, it kind of irritates me to see politicians treat politics like a game where they make reactionary policies based on soundbites and then jeer at one another in the commons apparently oblivious to the fact that they are supposed to be governing the nation and that it has major, real effects on people's lives.

You are totally correct though - it does depend on being lucky. It reminds me of Kinnock's speech:
&gt;If Margaret Thatcher is re-elected as prime minister on Thursday, I warn you. I warn you that you will have pain – when healing and relief depend upon payment. I warn you that you will have ignorance – when talents are untended and wits are wasted, when learning is a privilege and not a right. I warn you that you will have poverty – when pensions slip and benefits are whittled away by a government that won’t pay in an economy that can't pay. I warn you that you will be cold – when fuel charges are used as a tax system that the rich don't notice and the poor can't afford.

&gt;I warn you that you must not expect work – when many cannot spend, more will not be able to earn. When they don't earn, they don't spend. When they don't spend, work dies. I warn you not to go into the streets alone after dark or into the streets in large crowds of protest in the light. I warn you that you will be quiet – when the curfew of fear and the gibbet of unemployment make you obedient. I warn you that you will have defence of a sort – with a risk and at a price that passes all understanding. I warn you that you will be home-bound – when fares and transport bills kill leisure and lock you up. I warn you that you will borrow less – when credit, loans, mortgages and easy payments are refused to people on your melting income.

&gt;If Margaret Thatcher wins on Thursday, I warn you not to be ordinary. I warn you not to be young. I warn you not to fall ill. I warn you not to get old.

He usually acts in a way that is almost always better than those around him, someone who people should strive to be like. He forgives his enemies, or at least gives them a chance to turn away before destroying them. He has faced several foes who he described as having the power of a god, but defeated them all.

If you look at the great struggle against slavery in the United States, this began decades before Lincoln's presidency - arguably, it began with the birth of the Republic.  But for an extended period, the mass of the population was not particularly interested, or sought compromise.  The revolutionary struggle against the Old South was brought about by the intersection of two processes: the efforts of abolitionists to explain their cause and the deepening of the objective crisis.

The situation today is much more explosive.  Great masses of people are being thrown into struggles in southern Europe by austerity measures.  But the Greeks, Spaniards, and Italians, despite their courage and willingness to fight against austerity, have found no political solution to the crisis.

The objective situation in the UK trails behind, but not by so very much.  2011 showed that great masses of young people here are furious at the injustice of society - but again, the political problems remained unsolved (or, unfortunately, not addressed).

In Britain right now, if you aren't rich/living off assets, working or looking for work, you pretty much only have two options. Die on the street of starvation or hypothermia, or rely on the charity of others to sustain you. Are you expecting a socialist society to involve a truck that drives around visiting every house on a daily basis with a hamper of food put into the hands of every citizen? People would still have to work to sustain themselves. Hopefully they would have to work less, in better conditions, doing jobs they enjoy. But it's fair to expect people to contribute to collective sustenance and by extension their own. Some people would inevitably try to take advantage, as they do right now. A society being based on non-capitalist principals wouldn't intrinsically make it easier to avoid work, and it wouldn't mean people could slob around all day and still get paid.

Our society treats money as the ultimate motivator. The reality is that for most people, the things that they enjoy doing the most are done because they are enjoyable, and often aren't paid at all for doing them. The world's most skilled and fulfilled individuals are often hobbyists. The luckiest people amongst us can sustain themselves based on what they enjoy doing. In a society that isn't focussed around profitability, work can be incentivized by such radical notions as the science of the way that human minds actually work.

Sure you could say that the opposition gets more coverage but that has to be a general principle. So for example climate sceptics should benefit from it too. So should people critical of the governments policies on immigration, asylum and benefits

Which is not what happens - some oppositions are regarded as more worthy than others. 

My principle would at least mean if you get x% in of the votes you get x% of the screen time. I think it should work on an average of opinion polls too - not general election results. The rationale is that if a party is trending it needs more attention and indeed more scrutiny. Whether that attention benefits it or not is up to the party.

Lest you worry about the BNP the BNP probably get more coverage under the current system than under mine. It's just that every minute of it is some left wing hack saying what swine they are. The one time they were allowed to speak - Nick Griffin on Question Time - they made that point much better themselves.

People don't need public school boys and girls treating them to the three minute hate about the BNP. Let the fuckers speak and most people will work out they are very dangerous people.

Also most of the BBC's censorship is not aimed at the BNP. Rather it is aimed at completely constitutional parties which the majority of BBC employees don't like.

* This caused a rapid decrease in the amount of money (and credit) in circulation

* Governments are frantically trying to counteract this by loosening monetary policy i.e. quantitative easing and lowering interest rates

* By fault or design, all that electronically printed money is going directly to the banks to restore their balance sheets, which would show they were non-viable going concerns if [normal rules of accounting weren't suspended in 2008](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark-to-market_accounting#Effect_on_subprime_crisis_and_Emergency_Economic_Stabilization_Act_of_2008) 

* Near zero interest rates are allowing banks and governments to borrow vast sums of money very cheaply

* Essentially, the whole financial system is on life support. 

* Austerity is a fig leaf covering this orgy of artificially created cheap money

* I think the aim is to repair banks to such a state that they feel emboldened enough to start lending at pre-crisis levels again. But is that a good thing? All this cheap money will almost certainly lead to more bubbles and is not leading to any kind of sustainable growth at all.

If you go down in an exaggerated way, yes it's exaggerated, but it's not like it's without reason, and you have to do it to get any real chance of a call.

Granted, there is still a spectrum as to what a forward thinks is a foul in the first place.

As an ex alcoholic and cocaine addict myself, I honestly can't upvote this comment enough. You get money and something triggers in you, you - as I like to call it - take your brain out. Two/three/four days/a week/two weeks later that money is completely gone and you're left with not only a huge hole in your wallet but wondering what the fuck just happened and how you're going to deal with the fallout; then you hit rock bottom. Again. 

I can't image what even an ex addict on the dole suddenly with a lump sum in the bank would do because, quite frankly, it's one of those ""do now, think later"" situations that you sometimes have no control over.

That's what addiction is, loss of control. 

There again there are those who think addicts shouldn't get benefits at all because, well, they're addicts and then there are the people who are making these changes who obviously don't care one iota because it's so far removed from their own reality they just can't see the social issues it'll stir up.

Many (or 'most' probably) companies will have pension scheme options set up for their employees, and pension payments are managed in a similar way to payroll taxes.

These days this will be a 'defined contribution' scheme of some kind, and your employer will automatically deduct your chosen percentage from your payslip and pay it, along with their contribution, into the scheme. They will also automatically manage the tax relief for you at the same time. If your employer doesn't have such an option available, then you can set up a personal pension (a SIPP being a type of one of these), but getting the tax relief will need a self-assessment.

At retirement you can use your pot of pension savings to buy an annuity, or take some of it as a tax-free cash lump sum depending on what happens to the tax system between now and then. Any annuity is then taxed as if it were a salary.

----------

To answer your questions:

* A SIPP is a type of personal pension. Payments into this get tax relief, the earnings are tax-free, and you use it at the end to buy an annuity which is taxed in the same way as a salary.
* An ISA is essentially a normal savings account or investment, with the benefit that the earnings it makes are tax-free. There is no need to buy an annuity on maturity (and no restriction on withdrawal age), but note that there is no tax relief on payments into the ISA.
* If your employer offers a pension scheme it may be better to use that rather than a personal pension since you will get the benefit of employer contributions, and easy tax-relief.
* ISA rates are crap at the moment. You may find a better deal with a 'regular saver' account even taking the tax relief on interest into account.",0,1363131650,null,0,false,0,c8uivvr,t3_1a5ter,t1_c8uivvr,t3_1a5ter,null,1431566031,5,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,5

They lowered the interest rates to 0.5% which means I've been losing about 1% of my savings each year to inflation, then 2 years later they decided that anyone with savings over £16K can go suck a dick if they're made unemployed. 

Anyway, why's the limit so high if it's just meant to be a safety net for the completely desperate? Are you of the opinion that anyone with a positive bank account should not receive any benefits whatsoever? 

If not then I'm not sure how you can draw the imaginary line in the sand at £x,000..

Finally, how many people do you think this £16K limit effects? It's not going to be many.. It's saving barely anything in the grand scheme of things, but still piss off the few people like me that actually bothered to be frugal and save.

true,naughty,null,null,"&gt; No unskilled economic immigration, period. If you have a skill that our workforce requires, however, which is not an easy thing to learn (i.e. having a phd from a very prestigious Uni in a science); by all means come.

A lot of the farming industry would be very affected by this, locals won't pick fruit for the same wages or as well. Generally it won't benefit the UK from an economic point of view at all, but if you consider unskilled foreigners a social problem them I see your point but I disagree with it.

&gt; We should save in a boom, spend in a recession.

This is a good one. There is the issue with it causing inflation (when the recession hits) and government saving is technically a way to manipulate the value of your currency downwards (make exports cheaper, imports more expensive).

&gt; Nuclear power must take precedence over shitty wind farms, it's not pretty; however if we want good, fairly clean power, we must go nuclear.

Not totally against the idea of more nuclear but we're a very windy country and we could get a lot of use out of windfarms. Also nuclear is really bloody expensive.

&gt; Life means life. Take a life, either be offered an execution or life in prison.

If the change was made (Life sentence being imprisonment without chance of parole) the sentence would be rarely used. Not a fan of the execution option personally, also they can technically try suicide.

&gt; Foreigners who are found guilty in this country should be deported straight away.

They do try and do it but it's a big problem the current and previous government have been dealing with.

&gt; Prisoners who can should work on a farm 5 days a week &amp; learn a trade on the other two days.

These kind of programs can easily end up taking the jobs of non-criminals because prisoners don't need to be paid anywhere near the amount a farmer does. If they just made their own food it might be workable but you'll need to buy a lot of land to get it done.

Education in prison is something I can agree with.

&gt; Education must improve, I'm open to ideas on this.

I personally think we need to force a bit of freedom on schools so they can figure out what works.

&gt; No armed forces budget rises until we're ""booming"" other than maintaining our Nuclear deterrent.

£100 billion to replace the nukes, by far the largest single expenditure. I think it's probably best to keep a nuclear deterrent but it's only fair to point out how expensive they'll be.

&gt; Religious people who preach outright hate to this country (such as Anjem Choudary) for religious reasons should be given two oars, a boat, thrown into the sea &amp; told to fuck off. Shoot them if they come back.

I'd assume you're exaggerating on this one, you can't just exile people in a boat and shoot them, we're not savages. The idea of what to do about hate mongers is a tricky one, free speech should be allowed but where's the dividing line?

&gt; Offer a referendum on the EU, I'm not really all that bothered which way it goes; however the British people deserve a say.

True, I wish they'd call it sooner though if it's going to happen. It's starting to damage the UK's position in the EU and it's looking unlikely that the Tories will win the next election (and they're the only party promising to hold a referendum). Personally want to stay in the EU but sod the Euro.

&gt; Want more than two kids? Pay for it yourself, the state should only subsidise one or two children.

Well we need at least 2.1 children per person on average for replacement so what about subsidies for 2.1 children :\^) I'd worry that you'd essentially be forcing some people to have their children taken into care due to money which just costs the government more and increases the chances of the children being screwed up.

&gt; Cheat your benefits? Prison working on a farm until you've paid what you stole off.

Nicer than the old-style debtors prisons no doubt. I think asking people to pay back cheated benefits is fine though.

&gt; Ill? Can't work due to disability? Lost your job? State should support you. NHS patient care needs to be improved, but it should remain a pillar of society.

I'd agree.

&gt; The amount we spend on public services when are booming should be always below GDP.

Rather than attempting to stimulate the economy, they engaged in European-style budget-cutting and their central bank was reticent to launch a stimulus. It wasn't until 2000 that the government engaged on a spending spree. Yes, it led to their large deficit, but part of that can be put down to economic mismanagement in the years prior to 2000.

true,badwolf3618,angel,Weeping Angel,"I believe Rassilon and Omega (founders of modern Timelord society) put that limit on Timelords for whatever reason. They are born with a finite amount of regeneration energy. There was a device the Timelords had to give more regenerations, but I'm assuming that device is stuck in the Time War, which is sealed off from the Doctor, and I sincerely doubt he would risk the Time War spreading and destroying the universe by unlocking it just so he could go get more regens. 

That said, I don't like the idea of the Doctor being limitless with his regens. I would prefer that the show end at some point, albeit as far down the road as possible. All stories need to end (especially TV stories, we all know plenty of TV shows that were ruined because they went too long), and if you have a previously imposed limit, such as DW lore stating that a Timelord only has 12 regens, then you can tailor the storyline to that and have everything fit together well. Endless adventures would become boring. Seriously, how many universe-ending threats can there be? How long before the Doctor has reached every planet, every civilization, fight every enemy, touched every part of history? And doing all of this without crossing his own timeline or doing something that would accidentally negate an event he was previously engaged in? In terms of practicality, the Doctor can only influence so much history and development of civilizations before he would start running into problems and paradoxes.

We know Carra is retiring but I think Skrtel and Coates will both leave, Skrtel will not leave cheaply but thankfully a lot of clubs will be more than willing to pay up.

* **Ashley Williams** would be a brilliant buy and is already well established, I also think he's statistically the best CD in the prem this season

* **Stefan de Vrij** may look like Napoleon dynamites awkward cousin but he's the young up and comer the club is actively hunting and is very much like Agger, although as a kid he still makes stupid mistakes and tends to run out of position alot.

* **Bruno Martins Indi** now this is my preferred option, he's a young solid defender and he's also a big attacking threat, if we could get him AND Stefan then we've done a brilliant bit of business, two of the best (top 15) up and coming defenders in Europe but if we had to choose between them I'd have Bruno any day of the week.

* **Aly Cissokho** solid brick wall of a defender, really wouldn't suit our playing style of keeping control as he's more styled to just clearing the ball away any way possible  

* **Thomas Ince** I think he's good, but champions league good? No, Sterling is better on both wings, if we want another player on the opposite wing that's just as quick and proficient and younger then we can give Ibe a shout

* **Asmir Begovic** Throwing money away here

* **Xabi Alonso** if we can get him for 4 million then its a steal. He's a world class player, whos talent is passing the ball and he's arguably the best in the world at it, that sort of skill set has perhaps the longest playing age of any, even if he has 2-5 of his best years left that will do us an awful lot of good making CL progress until the next gen are ready to move in and BR said he wanted experience, well it doesnt get better than that

Basically, what they are doing can be construed legal or illegal depending on your outlook.

They cannot do it solely for funding purposes, e.g. We can't take you because we won't get funding due to your age. But they could then just argue ""Oh, there's high youth unemployment"" as an excuse getting them off.

It's not been tested in the courts whether this kind of ""positive"" age discrimination is legal or not.

true,Leonichol,cnty-uk,Geordie in exile (Surrey),"I think a lot of people are jumping to judgements about the poor rather quickly on this thread based on the title, their own myopic experience, and anecdotal stories.

All we know is this;

 - HB was paid via the tenant (this is currently an option on all new HB applications)
 - Rent rises were seen
 - Arrears cases went up

There is not necessarily any direct causation between direct payment and arrears cases. Any other factor could be the cause of the findings. I can hypothesize;

- Landlords put up prices faster than HB increased. This is especially true with the 'inflation + arbitrary fixed number + arbitrary percentage' placed into contract renewals which punishes renewing tenants. (I have seen how HB is calculated per authority... I have no idea where they get rental prices from, but it must be some form of peculiar biased source - protip, if you are a private sector renter, do not rent in an area with a high percentage of low-cost or social housing... drives down HB. Also, try and get contracts that last for several years rather than 1-12 month).
- Arrears raised so Landlord (especially multi-property) raise price of other properties to cover shortfall
- Area became more affluent or desirable so LL raise prices to meet increased price elasticity of demand. Easily leading to arrears in HB cases.

The general assumption in this thread so far is that the poor cannot manage their money therefore this system should be scrapped. Personally while I believe there is no doubt many anecdotal cases where this is true, I would not cast all HB recipients with the same brush. There are likely also plenty recipients who are very adept at managing their cash-flow. If anecdotal evidence is your thing, I could give plenty examples from either side of the coin.

From the data we have, we simply cannot make the assumption that it is the direct payment schemes fault that arrears cases have risen. We simply do not have enough information to make that call. I think it is a great shame that the BBC has only used quotations that reflect this limited view.

The main benefit of tenant payment is that they do not have to declare their status to their present landlord unless specified in their contract (there are many contracts where this is the case, especially ones held/renewed over several years). Hell, you don't have to prove it to your new one unless you willingly provide a bank statement or the contract stipulates it (usually the case when the LL has a newer type insurance). I would suppose, that it is also perfectly possible to circumvent the morally atrocious 'no dss' listings through two bank accounts, where one pays the other so it looks as if you're living off savings. 

The theory is also you can move more quickly without having to wait for the government to switch payment from one LL to another. This would be true if it wasn't almost impossible for HB tenants to move around freely regardless of their situation due to many landlords refusing HB tenants.

The big problem I see is in the case of rental prices rising (regardless of cause), leading too;

 1. Not being able to pay your rent on your current property. In a perfect world this would simply make you downsize. In the situation we have allowed to occur however, that may not be possible due to restrictions on HB people made by landlords.
 2. Therefore they go into rent arrears on their current property. Of course, they can't just move out now as no where will accept them, so they ask the council if they can move into council housing (with its dwindling supply).
 3. The council says no, as moving out would label them as 'willingly homeless' under the current rules.
 4. So the tenant stops paying rent, and waits to be evicted. As this is what it takes to not be willingly homeless and therefore receive social housing.
 5. This increases costs for landlords. Which they pass on in higher rent for all their tenants. 
 6. Which causes landlords to become dubious of people on HB who can't pay and cost to be evicted.
 7. Which causes banks and insurers (especially those of the BTL market) to make it harder for them to rent a property. Decreasing supply and raising prices for all.
 8. Go back to 1.

This is quite obviously, a viscous circle which traps people on HB in the same place with no options while at the same time raising the price of houses. It isn't entirely (or sometimes even at all) the recipients fault this situation occurs. **The systems rules and lack of protective legislation banning discrimination against HB recipients is designed in such a way where at some point, they are going to get fucked. Hard. And on purpose.**

Of course, if you have family that can buy a house for you, you can potentially buy a BTL property for your poor relatives and escape this madness. Except that many councils disallow this for not being 'commercially acceptable' and would rather have you fund someone else's mortgage play/retirement/income fund.",0,1363144043,null,0,1363167466,0,c8un3ob,t3_1a64el,t1_c8un3ob,t3_1a64el,null,1431568155,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;To see the alternative - well, there is only a schematic in flesh today. But recall that the mass action of Egyptian workers threw out Mubarak's quarter-century dictatorship in eighteen days.

Consider that they planned for the uprising in Spain for decades, and because of that and the knowledge and capabilities of the wider population they were able to pre-empt the initial counter-revolution, and hold the line for some time before the forces of fascism and counter-revolution and foreign capital were able to co-opt and/or overpower them, in '60s France, '70s UK, pre-Fascist Germany and Italy, they didn't even make it that far, since their plans either didn't exist or didn't work once they'd pushed as far as they could, and the backwashes were sometimes fatal, but always dis-spiriting.

For who? I imagine there are some on benefits that are way too high (likely baby poppers). But for the vast majority, especially those U25 on JSA this is far from the case. Don't trust newspapers. Go to the gov.uk site and do the maths to see what would happen if you were unemployed. Bet you get income protection insurance soon after.

&gt; Millionaire bankers have wrecked the economy.

Lots of people blame bankers directly and seek to enact revenge. I blame the legislative system and their permissive risk taking operating environment rather than individuals.

&gt; Government doesn't have a fucking clue

You're likely right here. I don't know what it is about this current administration compared to the one before it, but it really does seem to really fuck a lot of simple shit up. The cynic in me however doesn't believe it is because they are simply stupid.

&gt; At the same time young people were pushed into degrees, they were massively devalued. It's all well and good pushing for more apprenticeships but what about all the unemployed graduates?

Pushed? In a market economy you choose to do the degree which suits your goals. If you don't agree with the value of the degree, then you don't do it or pay a lower price. Personally my science degree hasn't been wholly devalued. What about the unemployed graduates? They are no different to unemployed plebs if they don't have marketable skills.

&gt; Jobs are incredibly hard to get.

Agreed. So move where they are not. People in Ireland seem to be doing this enmasse. This has the double benefit of making the welfare system more affordable. I realise there is an inherent cost in this, of course.

&gt; Obtaining your first house is impossible. Renting is the only option.

I hear this a lot. But unless you're trying to get a BTL property or a 3 bedroom house in rural surrey with a 40% deposit, I'm at a loss to back this up. I can afford a deposit with under 5 years of hard ass saving. Admittedly, the property will not be to the standard I am accustomed.

&gt; Population (through immigration and previous prosperity) is out of control. Immense pressure on public services such as health and police.

Out of control? Immense?! Evidence doesn't back this up. Immigration/asylum have a minimal strain on the welfare state allegedly. Your concern should be that the influx of cheap workers keeps wages low (supply outstrips demand), not the problems with the NHS and policing.

&gt; The environment is being destroyed. No credible plan for mass renewable energy.

I am going to label this 'Myopicapathy' - where experience means you are unable to formulate unlikely and as of yet completely remote possibilities, and therefore do not care for them. I agree, but I think there is a certain amount of present comfort which makes our ability to operate in such an environment with such an attitude possible. We are rich enough and comfortable enough to afford to be as politically lazy as my generation is.

If our circumstances were to change. I imagine people would soon change their attitude.

&gt; What you're despairing over is being completely closed out of the political establishment, which has presented itself as hostile to your interests.

This resonated with me a lot. Being highly aware and completely closed out (not that I have tried... what would be the point). I don't think however that the cited group would help there at all.

As a capitalistic principle the more educated your workforce the bigger the attraction of high skilled jobs.

The only problem was the lowering of the barrier to entry and the ability for trivial degrees to attract students. To detract from this, successive administrations give Universities the ability to set fees and to remove caps.

Ultimately, you are right, but it is also a problem. When you are a group of people living in Hampshire that wants a river sorted. No problem, you get to the council. When you are an idealist that thinks otters should be given pink bands, an ideal you share with say 50k other British people dispersed around the country thinly, who do you pressure as a group?

We would have to reorganise our electoral system so MPs are not elected from regions, as people would not care about an individual tied to a party which says things they care little about. In our current system, minor parties become electable as more groups become disenfranchised.

They believe that 16k is the magical number whereby you can support yourself. This also fits with the idea that it is Government policy at the moment to make you spend rather than save (also see interest rates which discourage saving. A savings account or a cISA are almost pointless 2013-2014).

I have read your rebuttal below and I want you to consider an extreme. You have 200mil saved but have become unemployed. Should you still be entitled to benefits even though through interest alone you would receive more?

While you have paid x in NI and IncomeTax, not all of this went to the welfare state. If you could withdraw only what you put in, how long would you last? If everyone could do the same, would there be any money left for those who are genuniely needy but have not generated enough payment through their time? (Although this system has a limited enactment through 'contribution based' jsa/esa - a hilariously scary concept which has been fucking people for about a year now).

The Government makes no distinction here between 200mil and 16k.

This is also why you see such lunacy where benefit claimants spend uncontrollably on items like massive TV's, kitchen upgrades and garden decoration. Because if they save anything, they will lose it all.

The talk of Henderson being a future captain is so premature, its a borderline joke. The guy is 23 this year, the age Gerrard was when he took over as captain. Not even close in capabilities or leadership. He isn't in the category of a developing youth - not in age, or wages or experience. He either gets it or he doesn't, and so far it seems that Rodgers' judgement is that he doesn't. Coutinho is what a rising star player looks like. The rest have had bright spots, but so did N'Gog and Pacheco.

I did go for the ""Christmas tree topper"" style, because why not? If you can put it on a tree, awesome! 

So, I followed the first tutorial from Creative Crossing for the first part of my journey. I started by taking the Barbie's legs off and fitting her on a bottle. To get her arms where they should be, I literally just cut them off and glued them in the correct position. 

I pulled out all of her hair and then made her ""angel hair"" out of clay. At this point, I was getting excited! I just kept building with clay, but then to get a better drape for the dress, I used fabric. It was a heavy fabric that I shaped and painted over. 

The wings are, without a doubt, the toughest part of this. I sketched out a wing a few times until I liked the shape and size. After that, I cut it out and traced it onto some cardboard and then cut that out. I molded clay around in and then just added the feather details. 

From there, I covered it in some stone texture spray paint. After a few coats, she was done! I know that's long winded, but I wanted to give a good explanation. ;)",0,1363156667,null,0,false,0,c8uqjaz,t3_1a60r2,t1_c8uqjaz,t1_c8ula40,null,1431569710,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

The same fate can easily befall a shift in spending - and we could end up with the cost but not the boost. So the measured approach is to only very very carefully spend (on as close to sure things as you can get) whilst maintaining the commitment to debt reduction.

Of course he literally [wrote the book] (http://www.amazon.com/The-New-Machiavelli-Politics-Business/dp/0471350958) on manipulating opinion for personal, business and political gain.

Here's a quote

&gt;  “Another option is for the 
businessperson to learn the art of dealing with the media, using all the
tricks that go with that trade – such as the false defeat: when a 
person seems to lose, in order to gain public sympathy, or the false 
triumph: where a person seems to win in order to appear strong – thus 
giving credibility to any number of dubious propositions that person may
wish to make in the future. Neither of these ploys are examples of the 
use of true facts, rather of false facts given to the media to chew on, 
much as a dog chews on a bone. Another useful ploy is the false 
accusation. First, create a situation where you are wrongly accused. 
Then, at a convenient moment, arrange for the false accusation to be 
shown to be false beyond all doubt. Those who have made accusations 
against both the company and its management become discredited. Further accusations will then be treated with great suspicion. Always remember that people’s memories are very frail, remembering only both the high spots and the lows of a person’s career, and then seldom remembering accurately.

Another question is why these allegations have been allowed to circulate for 20 years without any action having been taken (the tale of Scallywag magazine is shall we say *murky*).

You're not the first generation of people to demonstrate on a massive scale. The poll tax protests were a lot more violent and continuous, so were the coal mines being shut down. They also did nothing to stop it, but it's not an excuse for apathy. Your generation isn't even creating political art - it's mostly singing about how things are fine and dandy.

You're not the first generation to see unemployment above 8%. In the 80's it was 11% and the 90's 10.5%. It's around 7.5% now - far lower than when I cam out of uni looking for work.

No it's not. It's heralded by universities as the 'ultimate starting point' - no encyclopaedia is and ending point. You also have the rest of the internet and the free iTunes university courses available from the worlds leading universities. There was nothing like this available even 5 years ago.

&gt;You're not getting the same quality experience.

AIDS terrified EVERYONE.

Someone is going to come in and say 'yes but if we tax the 'rich' we won't have to make austerity cuts. Well it's not just like pulling a lever. Hmrc have set up many tasksforces for reducing loopholes and it takes time. And there are simply not enough very rich around for, even if we taxed them at 97% like in the 60s, for us to run the government we are accustomed to. The bulk of tax raises will fall on the taxpayers already heavily burdened. If you keep doing this, you make tax avoidance and evasion begin to seem worthwhile, as the middle class habitually do in other countries (ie Italy)

I think that should be concentrated pockets of stimulus in private and public infrastructure as some businesses need more capital to expand. But it's not as simple as austerity not working and stimulus working.

So if I invest in something, I have to adhere to *your* guidelines? One has to be uncaring when there are people starving in the world and yet someone else get a nice dinner every evening, so let's migrate the food banks abroad - See what happens once we start highlighting injustices for our own ends? I could, for example, (and if I were rich), donate large amounts to a charity, and ask - what are *you* doing? There are people starving you know; I think it's quite fair to invade your bank account using that money of yours that you're blatantly not using because *I* have a better use for it. And if you don't agree? Tough, I don't agree with the concept of money anyway.

&gt;In recent years there are a number of rich property owners that are squatting in Manchester.

No, they aren't. Redefine ownership if you like - but remember you need to give me all the money in your wallet because it was originally stolen by someone.

&gt;Former factories stand underused and in some cases deliberately left open to the elements and wild life so they can skirt planning law for easy demolition.

Sure, this goes on in my town too - but that's redevelopment for you; you can't *force* companies to start using these buildings. Private Eye highlights neglected classic buildings every week.

&gt;The main motivation is the waiting for other people to improve the area so their land/property value increases without them having to do anything.

They don't even need to do that - the value of the land will go up regardless. If the area improves, great; if it doesn't, they get more $ anyway. Just as most people do with the houses they own.

&gt;At some point ownership became an inversion, and in too many cases it means a rich person squatting on a resource to deny its wider utility. 

Or someone spots an opportunity before anyone else. The situation is far, far more complex than 'a rich person decided X' - that's the sort of reductive logic employed when you need a bogey man.

CGT is a tax on the profits made from the disposal of assets. CGT can be applied to anyone who owns a second home, shares or other assets

While this is true to some extent you conveniently fail to mention that Dividends are paid after corporation tax this massively reduces the gap between dividends and salary(although this gap is opening as corporation tax rates continue to fall).

Well they can't. CGT is payable on the sale of assets.

&gt;Why is there a difference in the tax rates between income tax and capital gains tax 

Because they're applied to different things.

&gt;Although it seems hard to disguise income as capital gains, should the government take action, just in case some people do disguise their income, by adjusting either income tax or capital gains tax rates? Maybe raise capital gains tax rates to match income tax?

And despite David Cameron's insistence that the North Korean-style ballot in the Falkland Islands – or Malvinas as they're known in Argentina – should be treated with ""reverence"", that rule of thumb clearly fits the bill in this case.

I missed the part where Falkland Islanders pray to 'Great Leader' David Cameron daily

&gt;The only surprise was that three islanders dared to spoil the rousing choruses of Land of Hope and Glory by voting against.

DAE feel that people who are invested within Britain are sheep?

&gt;It's that the poll was a foregone conclusion and designed to miss the entire point of Britain's dispute with Argentina over the islands – which began 180 years ago when one of Lord Palmerston's gunboats seized them and expelled the Argentine administration

So twisted as to actually be a lie. Argentina did not exist at this point so using 'Argentine' is pernicious. Also the British presence went back well before and the Spanish/mercenary presence there was limited to months.

&gt;By giving the colonists a veto on any change in the islands' status, the British government is trying to pre-empt the issue at the heart of the conflict. But it won't be recognised by Argentina or Latin America, or Africa, or the UN – which regards this relic of empire as a problem of decolonisation – or the US, which is neutral on the dispute. All call for negotiations on sovereignty, which Britain rejects.

Apart from the UN charter, which *enshrines the right to self-determination*, which the Falkland Islanders have shown quite evidently

&gt;But surely the islanders have the right to self-determination, it's argued, even if they're 300 miles from Argentina and the other side of the world from Britain.

Because proximity is everything...

&gt;Nor can forced colonisation of other people's lands legitimate self-determination – otherwise Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank would have the right to decide the future of Palestinian territory.

Yes Falklands for the penguins! 

&gt;The junta's defeat helped free Argentina from a vicious western-backed dictatorship. But military success was a disaster for Britain, rescuing Margaret Thatcher from the depths of unpopularity to unleash devastating neoliberal shock therapy, and rehabilitating overseas military adventures

That and Labour's longest suicide note in history.

&gt;Britain's refusal to negotiate with a democratic Argentina – when it was happy to talk to the country's dictators – has no significant international support:

What about a 'democratic' Argentina (which nationalises industry and refuses to compensate companies, where inflation is rife) and its refusal to acknowledge the Falkland Islanders requests?

&gt;. A negotiated settlement is in the interests of Britain, Argentina – and the islanders. The sooner time is called on the emperor's new clothes saga of the Falklands, the better for all of us.

Britain has offered to split mineral and oil trading rights but Argentina is refused. Milne CANNOT get over the fact that the Falklands wish to be British. Negotiation is only happening in his cloud cuckoo land. But then I shouldn't expect better from someone who has downplayed Stalin's atrocities.

You should have added some business to the economics. The point is that the theory is nice (spend on infrastructure &amp; welfare, watch the economy grow) but the actual maths has to add up. You have to find people (the market) who believe the growth will turn up and invest. Then the economy has to produce the goods (no guarantees) and then Greece (for example) has to be sensible with the proceeds (terrible track record). Assuming all of those things are true, the amount of money generated has to offset the additional costs (eventually) and not simply spiral into more &amp; more debt, never to get on top of it.

I don't think Joe Allen has been particularly enthralling at any point this season. He did a job early on, he's made some decent cameo's recently. He's just not looked as promising as players like Henderson and Shelvey who have had poor performances, but both have shown excellent technical ability, passing range and have chipped in with goals and assists.

That isn't remotely how the legal system works. The ONLY reason you would ever ask a victim to drop the case is so their metrics look better. Even cases that have no chance of going forward are dropped NOT by the victims but by the CPS.   

It is up to the CPS to decide what goes to court and what gets dropped. The police should NEVER be asking victims to drop cases - that's just wrong on so many levels.

I think this indicates a lack of perspective. The ""normal"" people's lives are totally regulated at least from their entry into the education system. It's just that they have adapted to the regulation well enough that it feels normal and they imagine themselves to be reasonably free to express their will. 

I don't think it's depressing that people can't function but that we live under a system of regulation which is sufficiently inflexible to allow for those of us who don't naturally go with this kind of flow. 

It seems to me that a certain proportion of humans is naturally inclined to thrive under the type of structure that dominates our society.

You can say that stopping austerity will do that, but like any 'business' plan there are no guarantees it will work - you might not generate the revenues you claim you will, you might trigger a bigger increase in the cost of borrowing than you think you will given the dangers with weak EU and the market attitude to spending governments.

The garrison (which I assume is what you're talking about when you say subsidised) is **only** necessary because of the **direct actions of Argentina** - before 1982 there was nothing more than a tiny contingent of Royal Marines on the Falklands that used it for training.

You cannot blame the Islanders for that, they didn't ask for it, they don't want it and if Argentina had done the right thing after the junta fell and dropped it's constant aggressive rhetoric and bullying; I'm certain we wouldn't have 5,000 troops and a constant rotation of submarines and warships on and around the islands. In fact, were it not for the war and if Argentina had softened its position then they would be closer than ever to having some hold over the islands and the Islanders would probably be independent.

It baffles me that so many British people can hold this view that former colonial territories are simply arrogant, backwards people that bleed central government dry, nothing could be further from the truth.

It would be funny if it wasn't so sad that these same people take this attitude because they're ""anti-colonial, anti-empire, anti-imperialism"" when their attitude is exactly that of the colonial powers of old. You made these places when it suited you and now that they're not of advantage you want to abandon and wash your hands of them and leave these **British citizens** to see their home be taken away.

Wikipedia also reports that both [the FBI and the British Home Office](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_accusation_of_rape#Estimates_of_the_prevalence_of_false_accusations) have estimated unfounded (but not necessarily outright false) claims at around 8% of the total claims, and both of these estimates have been criticised for being too quick to dismiss a claim.

Regardless of what the money is being used for, the maths still have to work. Just because we are paying for hospitals does not mean that 1+1 doesn't equal 2.

&gt; And you can create the extra growth you need with almost certainty by increasing investment into human capital, technology, our infrastructure and so forth

This is a theory and not a certainty hence my point. Either way i agree we should spend money on infrastructure but by offsetting other costs to preserve the reduction in spending. 

&gt; Banks operate by taking our money, investing it into projects, then making a profit on this. They give us a small percentage of this in our bank accounts. It's called INVESTING, a very basic and universal concept. There is some risk involved, but these forms of investment have been very dependable in the past to provide return.

The greatest example in history of where we did assume they knew what they were doing and would reliably make a profit, and in fact they screwed up and lost money on a scale unparalleled in human existence. It's funny how you couldn't have picked a worse example of how investment went terribly wrong. 

&gt; You must spend to make money. If you wanna talk business, businesses take loans all the time, they takes calculated risks all the time. Don't give me that bullshit.

Yes and equally they mess up all the time. Some businesses are a better investment than others. I really don't understand how you have arrived at the point where somehow if you spend money on any kind of enterprise you are guaranteed to make a return. Are you crazy? 

&gt; If you don't know what you're talking about, I suggest you go stick it up your ass mate.

Nice point eloquently put. I'm pretty sure you are running out of ideas now. 

&gt; Because I for one am deeply aggravated by the poverty I see where I live, how its being exacerbated by the wealthy upperclass who seem hell bent on turning the poor against one another, who are unscrupulous in their desire to ascertain greater riches for themselves. Stop being a victim of the propaganda perpetuated by the rich elite in this country. We can creat an equitable society, one that invests in citizens and doesn't squander its wealth of the rich if we really tried.

Like a lot of idiots on the internet you can't separare reasonable aims with hyperbolic ranting. 

I agree that there is huge wealth inequality and it should be curbed. I agree that the pursuits of the wealthy have screwed over people. But that does not mean that every person with money or the political classes are setting out to damage the plight of the working poor. It doesn't mean that your theories on how to spend the money the country may or may not have are right. It certainly doesn't mean I have swallowed any propaganda (in fact it is you that have swallowed the propaganda of spending now will certainly save us). 

&gt; doesn't squander its wealth of the rich

We have been through a period of squander, and we have been directed by too much focus on what is good for wealthy finance people. But the reality is that we just spend too much money on stuff we cannot afford and that has to be corrected. There is no getting away from that point.

What are the assumptions you're making here? Are you assuming that the only case of 'real' rape is forcible rape, where you're assaulted by a total stranger in an alleyway? Are you alleging that your aunt 'knows' these rapes are false due to a lack of physical trauma done to the vagina/body? Because that's false. That's so fucking false that I can't even.

Most rapes are committed by somebody the victim knows. That's still rape.

When somebody is too drunk to consent or is passed out, and another predatory person has sex with them, that's rape.

When somebody that the victim thinks is their friend finds themselves alone with the victim and has sex with them, despite the victim saying 'no', it's still rape. Even if the victim does not physically fight back.

A sexual invasion which was not consented to is rape. A lack of consent is how rape happens. If you have consent, you don't have rape.

There are a tremendous number of ways that this can happen. Not all of these will show physical trauma to a vagina, or even to a body. In fact, most of them won't! I don't know how I can possibly make this any clearer or easier for you to understand.

False accusations happen, but they are statistically anomalous to the number of rapes which are reported; doubly so for the number of rapes which actually happen and go unreported.

The law in England and Wales is the [Sexual Offences Act 2003](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/1), which defines rape as:

&gt;A person (A) commits an offence if—

&gt;(a) he intentionally penetrates the vagina, anus or mouth of another person (B) with his penis,

&gt;(b) B does not consent to the penetration, and

&gt;(c) A does not reasonably believe that B consents.

The text of the [Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/2008/1769/article/5) is identical. The [Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2009/9/section/1) is similar:

&gt;If a person (“A”), with A's penis—

&gt;(a) without another person (“B”) consenting, and

&gt;(b) without any reasonable belief that B consents,

&gt;penetrates to any extent, either intending to do so or reckless as to whether there is penetration, the vagina, anus or mouth of B then A commits an offence, to be known as the offence of rape. 

There is no way to interpret those to imply that anyone except the person with the penis can commit the offence.

If a woman (or a man, for that matter) forces a man to penetrate her, the charge is only sexual assault and the maximum sentence is 10 years, whereas the maximum sentence for rape is life (in England, Wales and N.I.; in Scotland the maximum sentence for both offences is life.)",0,1363181046,null,0,false,0,c8utsmb,t3_1a7gx1,t1_c8utsmb,t1_c8utkqz,null,1435568389,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

The girl had woken up in the morning and spoken to a friend about it, apparently told her he raped her (possibly because she was worried about the father of her childs reaction if he found out). She told the police, and he woke to them banging on his door, he answered, they asked him who he was and whacked cuffs on him, took him to the station for questioning and kept him in a cell over night etc. He was released pending further investigation and wasn't allowed to come anywhere near my house. Two days later the girl broke down and admitted to the cops she was lieing and just regretting drunkenly sleeping with him and was sorry.

true,Dogsafe,null,null,"&gt;Although it seems hard to disguise income as capital gains

Actually, the problem tends to lie with it being the other way around. CGT has lower rates than would be applied to trading income, so people have to be careful that their capital gains weren't judged to be trading and face high tax rates. This is where the concept of Badges Of Trade came from, essentially a list of points to consider when judging whether an action is capital or trade. 

How about an example? I like making kit cars but don't having any interest in driving them. I've got limited space so I can't keep them either. I buy a kit, build it, sell it at a high enough price that I can afford another kit. I've made a profit here so I'd have to pay CGT (ignore allowances and exemptions for now)

Thing is, am I earning a living like this? What if I spend all my time doing it and the profit I made was enough to pay for a new kit and my rent? How many cars do I have to sell in a year before you start to feel that this is a job not a hobby? What if I did the same with run down houses? Buy one, do it up, sell it. Hobby? Job? Am I trading?

http://miscarriage.about.com/od/pregnancyafterloss/a/prematurebirth.htm

Between the 23rd and 24th the survival rate of the child outside of the womb increases significantly, from 17% to 39%.

&gt;**Premature Birth Survival**

&gt;Strictly speaking, most doctors define the age of viability as being about 24 weeks of gestation. In many hospitals, 24 weeks is the cutoff point for when doctors will use intensive medical intervention to attempt to save the life of a baby born prematurely. A baby born at 24 weeks would generally require a lot of intervention, potentially including mechanical ventilation and other invasive treatments followed by a lengthy stay in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).

&gt;In the hands of experienced specialists, though, babies born slightly earlier may have a chance at survival. **Babies born at 23 weeks may survive with these specialists in a state-of-the-art NICU, but the odds of survival are much lower.** The earliest baby to have ever survived premature birth was born at 21 weeks and 6 days, and this was reported in the news as having been a ""miracle.""

You're right, it is very emotive to look at pictures like that, and that's usually a pro-lifers go-to campaign to convince people that all abortion is wrong.

I understand. When you see these miniature versions of babies, it's easy to think that this is a ""full"" human life. But these aren't fully developed children, its takes weeks of development (after the 24 week point that is) (longer when outside the womb) to develop a fully functioning brain and other organs. The brain itself takes the longest, it's the main reason we are a distinct species from the rest of the animal kingdom.

It's extremely hard to determine at the exact point this ""group of cells"" becomes a functioning, capable organism as opposed to an ""extended-growth"" inside someone. Some develop faster, some slower, which just adds to the complexity of determination.

One thing I'll say though: I sure as shit hope someone needing/planning an abortion on purpose would be seeking it quite a few months before the 5.5 month mark.

&gt;People of all faiths and none can have opinions on moral issues.

Indeed they can, and most of the time morals and opinions live by side peacefully. The problem isn't the morals or opinions themselves, it's when people try to inflict an opinion or moral on someone else, at worst using law.

The other problem is: Morality can be/is subjective. One persons morality is another persons immorality (see polygamy, child marriage). People want to ban all forms of induced abortion, including in the case that the mothers life is at risk.....is that ""moral""?

true,Turil,k9,K-9,"You must define ""God"" first before anyone can accurately answer that question...

Seriously.

""God"" is, itself, just a word.  A name for a set of ideas.  And for humanity, it's probably the word that has the lease consistency in the set of ideas that people use when they use the term.  For example, most atheists use the term to mean ""an imaginary being that I don't want to believe exists, especially not the one I imagine that Christians believe exists"", which is pretty non-specific, and certainly very, very different from what actual Christians, and even moreso all the other people who use the term think of when they say God.

In general, from what I've found, the most common denominator (outside of atheists, of course), for defining the term God (as opposed to ""god"") is ""the force that created the universe"", as in: the opposite force of entropy, in physics.  In that sense, I'd say that anyone who's got any scientific training, including the Doctor would completely believe in God, since clearly the universe exists in some form, and thus there must be a force holding it together.  It would be insane to say that God, the force behind the universe coming together, doesn't exist.  (Which is very likely why most folks who do believe in God think atheists are nutters, since it looks like they are denying the existence of reality.)

I think it's also important to point out that the stories in religious traditions are metaphorical/artists in their framing.  They are literally true, but often only in the sense that saying that the ""sky is blue"" is literally true (when in fact, the sky is clear and we only perceive a particular range of the spectrum because of refraction of the light coming from the sun bouncing off of water particles and such in the sky).  The force that works to create things (whatever the opposite of entropy is) is not something we can objectively ""see"", so it naturally will have lots of pretty weird descriptions, and even more weirdness happens when poetic approaches are used to talk about it, the way religious stories are designed to do.  Love may be like a red, red, rose, but that doesn't mean that love IS a red rose.  And so to is God like a man (or woman) who loves his creation, but is not a man (or woman) who loves his creation.  A lot of people have a hard time with art, and take it a bit too literally, and religious stories are no exception.  So remember that when you start thinking about what God is. :-)",0,1363187631,null,0,false,0,c8uvg71,t3_1a5hyt,t1_c8uvg71,t3_1a5hyt,null,1431572130,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

You defined theft as taking which belongs to someone else, a broader definition would be taking which doesn't belong to you.

&gt; One has to be uncaring when there are people starving in the world and yet someone else get a nice dinner every evening, so let's migrate the food banks abroad - See what happens once we start highlighting injustices for our own ends?

This is a false equivalency. In the housing scenario one person ""has"" something they don't use. In the eating scenario the eater actually eats the food.

&gt; There are people starving you know; I think it's quite fair to invade your bank account using that money of yours that you're blatantly not using because I have a better use for it. And if you don't agree?

Yes, I agree but it depends on the context. If a person had managed to amass so much money that it made others poor by removing the medium of exchange that makes commercial activity possible then redistribution should occur. However, the ultimate problem is the flaw in currency mechanics. Your example is again bad: my point was about a house for a house, money for money, domain names for domain names, and so on, and you've introduced the idea of money to food.

&gt; No, they aren't. Redefine ownership if you like - but remember you need to give me all the money in your wallet because it was originally stolen by someone.

It took him 8 months to cover the 14.500miles of the trip and the result is a couple of entertaining posts and videos on his website: C90adventures.co.uk. Because he had a lot of unedited footage he decided to start a kickstarter project to help him fund the professional editing of the video to make a proper DVD.
I think the ideia is brilliant and if the posts and videos on Youtube are anything to go by, it will be a fantastic DVD.
Think more of modern days Monde Enduro and not so much Long Way Round, a cheap, easy to fix and hard to destroy bike and a crazy Brit having a whole lot of fun along the way!
Seriously, check it out, I guarantee it will be the best couple of hours you spend online (yes, it's even more entertaining then that place where nice ladies gowild andshare their artistic photos!). This guy goes across Malaysia, Thailand, buys a second bike to go across Vietnam when the officials won't allow him to bring his C90 in the country and even finds time to hike to the Base Camp of Everest @5500m in 7 days wearing a pair of jeans and DC trainers! Ad that's just the first weeks of his travel!
I'm absolutely stunned with audacity of this easy going Brit. How did I not find this online earlier!?

This in turn leads to people who where raped not wanting to come forward because people will not believe them and they will not get the conviction.

People who report false rape harm people who where raped just as much as the people they have falsely claimed against. False rape allegations should always be prosecuted, and always be reported the idea of ""just wanting to get on with my life now everyone knows I am innocent"" along with the other people saying ""if they prosecute that person for falsely claiming rape then it will discourage real rape victims coming forward""  helps no one, it allows the person who falsely accused to get off without consequences, people see that and assume the next person along is just the same even though they where not even though that second person really was a victim of rape. Both are under reported because they are feeding off of each other. Its a vicious cycle its the same with domestic abuse the fashion in which we as a society are combating these things are not working in the slightest a change in tactic is required if things are going to improve. Do not ask me how we change it because sadly I do not know. I look at society and humanity and I think for the love of all that is we have forgotten what key words we like spewing mean, words like justice, freedom, equality so forth.

There is no justice for anyone in cases of false rape or rape I do not care what conviction the rapist gets while it may help bring the victim some type of closure for the rest of that persons life they will simply be a survivor and no longer the person they where or could have been, eventually the rapist will get their ""freedom"" back but the victim will never be free again. The same is true of those falsely accused from that moment on do you think their life will resemble anywhere near what it was or could have been they will always be worried of it happening again always be cautious and never truly trust someone intimately again. The first thing I know I would recommend we do is start to acknowledge them as social issues and not gender issues though, even though we claim to do that the now the sad pathetic truth is for the most part in the media and in the way we tackle them we don't really treat them as social problems at least I feel that way about it there are a few perfect example which prove me wrong out there but they just seem like the rare shining beacons of examples rather than the norm to me.",0,1363190675,null,0,false,0,c8uwex1,t3_1a7gx1,t1_c8uwex1,t1_c8uuq0d,null,1431572679,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

By showing the prosecutions they account for everyone regardless of conviction if they only count the convictions then its becomes distorted because of how difficult it is to prove, now your only looking at those found guilty as rapists. So if a person is found not guilty will you automatically count them in the falsely accused category now? Well no you wont because your only looking at those convicted and there might not be a conviction because the person who was falsely accused may not want to pursue it. Its tricky I see your point in that looking at the convictions gives a more accurate account of those guilty, but a large pool of cases are now being ignored completely which will not help in showing how prevalent or rare both are especially when rape is so hard to prove or disprove.

Comparing conviction rates to reported cases and prosecuted would be a good thing if that was what you where implying to do since it would let us see the number found guilty, the number reported and the number which progressed to prosecution in essence allowing us to track the progress of cases as well as demonstrate how hard they are to prove or disprove.

It matters because social harm is just as relevant to the actions of a nation state as individual harm. It matters because the finding reinforces the fact that rape culture persists. And before we even go there (not saying that you would personally, but someone doubtless would) rape culture does not necessarily mean that people are committing rape left, right and centre, but that pernicious attitudes of blame and dismissal persist with regards victims of rape. The notion that large numbers of people are making up their rape accusations is just one example of that.

There are myriad ways it matters that the conventional wisdom is flawed without it meaning we can pretend false accusations don't happen. The fact is though, far more victims of rape are being lambasted for having an awful experience than are falsely accusing. From the perspective of social good prevailing over the individual, addressing rape culture should be the primary focus. It could even be argued that a more open discourse and further understanding of the issues by judicial and health professionals may offer further security to those who are falsely accused, while offering those same benefits to the much larger quantity of disenfranchised victims.

true,Verochio,null,null,"For single currency country or regional debt funds I think it obviously makes sense. For country equity funds I think theoretically it does make sense as well. When I say theoretically, I’m assuming that for a currency there is no long-term expected positive return that you get for stock markets. However, there is long term volatility. So essentially by adding currency risk to your investments you are adding expected volatility without adding expected return (assuming zero or positive correlation between the two...). That, generally speaking, is a bad addition to a portfolio. However, hedging is expensive, so whilst you can expect less risk that a non-hedged portfolio, you can also expect less return. So I guess it all comes down to which has the greater expected Sharpe ratio, if you use such things.

I decided to go back and do some back testing over the last 40 years on the S&amp;P500, looking at un-hedged returns in GBP, vs “perfectly hedged” (zero cost) returns. It turns out that while the standard deviation of quarterly year-on-year returns is indeed higher for the un-hedged portfolio, the average of quarterly year-on-year returns is also slightly higher (though I’m not sure that much higher to compensate for the hedging cost). This makes sense in a way, given the long-term trend of devaluation of the pound against the dollar. Who knows whether that will continue into the new world of BRIC dominance?

Generally speaking, if it’s cheap enough, I think I’ll hedge single market currency exposure, foreign debt, money markets etc, and just accept the risk on regional or global equity indices.",0,1363193770,null,0,false,0,c8uxgtw,t3_19wrfr,t1_c8uxgtw,t1_c8uikvi,null,1431573215,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

Hi Sean, 

I am very glad to hear about your interest in our products. I will be happy to answer your question.

As it turns out the American and the European branches operate independently from each other. Because of this we cannot do transatlantic deliveries. The system will simply not allow it, that is why the item disappears from your cart every time you try to purchase it. The payment would also not go through since the payment needs to be from one of the selected European countries. 

There are only two options at this point. You could have someone in Europe order the item for you. This person could then resend it to you in the US once it is received. the other choice is to try to purchase this item from a third party. I can suggest trying this website: www.prodirectsport.com. they are UK based but they have a wide product variety and they do transcontinental shipping. 

I do apologize for the inconvenience and thank you in advance for your understanding. Please let me know if there is anything else I cna help you with. 

Kind regards,
Axel

It may be that false rape allegations are much more likely to be nipped in the bud before they get to trial, e.g. when the accuser realises they've made a serious mistake and backs out.

It also assumes that each rape prosecution corresponds to a real rape, and similarly for false rape. It may be the case that half of the rape prosecutions *are* for false rape!

Finally, the police may simply be less likely to prosecute false rape allegations, perhaps because they are harder to prove, and perhaps because once they are discovered they are seen as less serious than rape.

That said, I don't think any of these things will lead to a huge change to the numbers. And since they didn't actually measure what people *believe* the rate of false allegations to be, it just tells us that it is pretty small. I already thought it was pretty small.

Bournemouth is just next door if you want to go to the beach, winchester is just up the road if you want some nice shops and cafe's.

People keep saying this as if its a justification, but it's simply ridiculous. No, prison is not 'supposed' to be nice, but nor are the prison officers 'supposed' to single you out for public mocking and humiliation. That doesn't help anyone and is actively a nasty thing to do, punishment should be dictated by the law and not by the petty desires of your prison officer.

Perhaps there is a fundamental difference in views here. I view prison as a necessary place for people to be punished, kept away from society, and where possible rehabilitated in accordance with the law. That's already not nice, I wouldn't want to go to a place like that. I *don't* see why this should make it reasonable for the wardens in positions of power to bully the inmates individually. In contrast, it seems many people here see it as somewhere where you deserve whatever you get because you did a bad thing so who cares eh?

If you choose to view it as a gender issue by all means go and do so and lets say you succeed and you start protecting those 90% female from rape. So you have 100 people 90 of the female 10 of the male, you succeed through your initiatives and your campaigns to protect lets say 85 of the females now its 1 third female victims and 2 thirds male victims so now is it a gender issue for males alone since now they are the majority victim and now do we ignore those remaining 5 women? 

Sure am using a hypothetical here in saying you managed to protect a large number of the female rape victims but can I ask why you can't view it as a social issue and try to protect 100% of the victims why you have to view it as a binary gender issue and tackle it as such and why not a social issue and tackle it as a culture and a group? Why divide when you can co operate and help each other.

Just adding some reading here for you

http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/mar/17/stern-review-male-rape This is from 2010 the aricle point sout the estimated figure for male sexual assault is 1 in 7. It also points out research found that 81% of women who claimed domestic abuse went on to report while only 19% of males who claimed to suffer it went on to report so the under reporting of male domestic abuse in the UK was sagnificantly higher. The estimate says 1 in 7 males will be the victim of sexual assault.

The fact that someone can be able to do this repeatedly shows that.

It's not belittling rape to state that abuses of the system happen, I'm not saying we should avoid prosecuting rape cases, but we should be aware that it happens and attempt to catch those when it does. We don't have capital punishment because it can't be undone if found to be wrong, with rape allegations people's lives are ruined whether guilty or not. It's an emotive and ongoing issue for all involved.

Fundamentally, and aside from silly coincidences that mean nothing.. Doctor Who is nothing like Christianity. Nothing. 

The Doctor does not give a womens weight in silver, he doesn't hate on gay people, there is no such thing as heaven and hell and eternal damnation. Hundreds of millions of people have not had their lives ripped from them in the name of Doctor Who. The Doctor doesnt care if you are circumcised or not. The Doctor doesnt preach conservative self loathing shame of sexuality. The Doctor does not vow to kill anybody of the occult. The Doctor does not collect the foreskin of those he conquers. The Doctor does not encourage vicarious redemption. 

I could go on and on.. but I wont. Perhaps nobody saw the qoute from Matt Smith about his athiest beliefs? 
Anyway.. really guys this is no good. Keep Doctor Who beautiful and perfect in every way, in the words of Christopher Hitchens (who would do a better job at this then I) ""Religion ruins everything"". Do not ruin Doctor Who with Religion. Please.

The problem with a false rape allegation comes directly from how the accusation is handled and the fact that lives can be destroyed just by the accusation.

Rape has happened, the harm has already been caused and the victim's life has already been destroyed. In investigating it all we can do it hope to catch the perpetrator, which we most definitely should do.

I think it's the fact that one is something we can actively do something through the handling of a false rape report to prevent destroying an innocent person's life (the whole innocent until proven guilty thing). A fake allegation is seen as an easy-to-commit act of revenge but can have permanent, life altering effects in the same way that rape does on its victim. That's why it's seen as a pressing issue.

true,scarsremain,null,null,"I respectfully disagree, I feel that targeting efforts by treating it as a gender issue divides support, in turn you end up focusing on fixing a symptom instead of a problem. At least that's my perspective on it.
By all means you are correct in stating that more women report rape and are victims of it in our society by all records and estimates the majority of perpetrators are male, and we focus our efforts on addressing that leaving behind the others the vast majority of the time as a direct result 

The fact that both male and females reported similar claims of domestic abuse at 4.2% of the population in 2010 yet only 19% of the males who claimed it reported it to authorities and 81% of females reported it is a prime example 100 men abused 100 women abused in an issue which much like rape is treated as a gender issue 81 of the women felt safe to come forward and report it only 19 of the men did. There is such a thing as over focusing and I feel we tend to do that far too much when it comes to gender issues. The point here is you say you are not saying don't help the men, and you more than likely claim you do want to help them but then you marginalize them and push them aside by making it a gender issue in turn meaning less of them do come forward its why we still live in a society where so many people still don't recognize male rape or male victims of domestic abuse. Every time focus has went to males the number reporting it rose sharply. Also worth note estimates do say only 11% of males who are victims of rape report it this is apposed to an estimated 20% of females who feel they can report. By far and far more females are the victims by far and far more males commit the crime and by far and far the male victims we claim to want to help we ignore and push aside because they are a minority, this is a result to me of treating it as a gender issue and telling them that their gender is the primary perpetrator and that their gender is seldom the victim.

There have been times when he's been injured and wanted to rush back into playing, despite the physio's instructions. I also think the high line is needed if we want to play the way we do and as it doesn't really suit him I'm guessing he would probably stop playing it.
   But the worst thing that could happen if Terry were the manager is that he could get fired. It would be a very big post for a first time manager and the learning curve would be very steep, I doubt he'd be able to satisfy Abramovich, who isn't averse to firing Chelsea legends. And if that happened it would be the worst thing Abaramovich has done as owner.

So that's why I don't think Terry would be the best player manager.

I don't know how Glasgow does it, but the tuition is fixed for me for all 4 years (according to a first year here it still is), which is a bonus. My IS (Davis) went through a 25% tuition increase during my first year here and all I could think was haha, mine never goes up and looks like this WILL be the cheaper option in the end! Depending on where you live now, Edinburgh and Glasgow are two totally different cities. Every city has it's own spots that are higher crime rates/less safe so I won't make that a factor (though I live just outside Edinburgh in a wee town that is really safe). I've only ever been to Glasgow once, and that was because my neighbour (who plays in a wedding band) was nominated for the VOW awards so the mutual friend who drove him out to Glasgow for it and I went to watch Bond while he was at the ceremony. Glasgow felt exactly like San Francisco. And since I'm from that area, I actually hated being there - impossible to drive in because of turn restrictions and one-way roads. More dual carriageways (like LA freeways) which was confusing and we were super lost at one point. But it's probably more ""big city"" if you haven't lived like that and want to. But checking out the schools should give you a much better idea of where you'd want to go. And if you're a cyclist at all this area is very cycle-able. Ha the one thing is, is that Glasgow tends to get more rain than Edinburgh (so everyone says). And if you're a Harry Potter fan, it was written at the Red Elephant (I think) just on George IV Bridge downtown. Darwin graduated from UoE... Edinburgh is more of an international city I've noticed in that you tend to get a more diverse accents, but Glasgow seems to have thicker Scottish accents (that sadly I can't understand sometimes and was a problem during my Glasgow interviews). You can't really go wrong provided you are willing to make the journey across the pond and get a different experience. The only thing I regret is not travelling more during my first two years here. Quite scary though that I've literally got 9 more formal lectures left EVER. When abouts are you travelling here?

Edit to add a bit more info: When you receive the letter from the TOC (Southern) read it carefully. Make sure everything is correct. 

Your first letter will be asking for your version of events. Be honest, even if it isn't what you think will help you out, being honest with them will only help your outcome. However, be careful how you word things, don't give Southern more evidence to prosecute but also don't hold back anything which may be important, for example you don't have a credit/debit card because of your age and so that wasn't a possible form of payment for you and you only had note's.

Then towards the end add that you will be prepared to pay any costs incurred so far (admin fee's etc.) and for your full fare, plus penalty fare. If this is your first offence (which I'm guessing it is) then they tend to let you do this as it is a Win-win for the TOC, they don't have to pay a ton of money for court costs and they get the money you owe them plus a bit more. 

At 16 you most certainly don't want it to go any further than that, as landing yourself in court will seriously affect your future career since it will be a criminal record.

-------- Walker - Holtby - Sigurdsson -

--------------- Adebayor ----------------

Bench - Lloris, Dawson, Jan, Parker, Dembele, Coulthirst, Huddlestone

Gives us experience off the bench if we get into trouble, but ideally we'll be able to send most of the starters the full 90. Walker gets to try out the right wing, something I've been considering for a while now (is he the next Bale? It's possible, right?)

 Even if we lose 2-0, we still go through, so I think we blood the youngsters, try Walker out on the wing, and hopefully throw someone like Coulthirst, a true youngster, into the deep end to see how he does.

Why do you think this is special treatment? How do you other high profile people wouldn't be a treated in the same way at first just to bring them down a peg or two?

To me this perfectly exemplifies the culture in this country where people keep each others egos in check by bringing them down if they get above their station, it happens in every area of society from prisons to the army to just sitting around with your friends. 

I don't think the specifics here are particularly important because I don't think this treatment would be the exception, it's a part of the British psyche and doesn't sound at all malicious.

I am confused by this. Am I missing something? JSA/ESA/DLA are income rather than capital in benefits terms. By 'willing disposal' did you mean the notional capital rules, where if the DWP think that you shed capital to gain benefit they calculate your benefit as if you still had that capital (hence 'notional')? I don't have my books handy at this time of night to check, but as I recall debts are one of the things that you absolutely can pay without being treated as having shed capital to gain benefit.

Well your 'the usual' does cover a large proportion of the HB claimants. Almost anyone allocated a council home nowadays falls into a vulnerable category of person. I should probably own up that this point that my work involves IT, statistics and policy about this.

Disabled people by the way, are not exempt from the bedroom tax, unless they need the spare room for medical purposes.  

If you disapprove of social-sector housing altogether, then I think you might like the hidden attitudes of many of the Conservatives in government. Of course it exists today as a remnant of socialism. Thatcher got rid of lots of it, but not all. If we did get rid of it completely, then that would tend to put housing costs up, on average, and would reduce the consumer spending going on. It would also increase the numbers of people in 'dire straits' quite markedly.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;Well your 'the usual' does cover a large proportion of the HB claimants. Almost anyone allocated a council home nowadays falls into a vulnerable category of person. I should probably own up that this point that my work involves IT, statistics and policy about this.

Ok no problem. I subscribe to the Finnish ideals in this case, they do not have long term subsidised housing for anyone, despite being a highly socialised country with among the highest living standards in the world. If you can't afford to house yourself then you'll be placed into short term absolutely free temporary accommodation for 6 months or so. Your children will be removed from you because you've failed to provide for them. After this, you are expected to have found a new home.

This idea that we should subsidise 20% of the country's housing to me is just ridiculous, and as someone who's living in the bottom quintile of income right now, it pisses me off that some people are living with £200 /mo rent because of my subsidies while I'm spending the majority of my income on rent.

&gt;Disabled people by the way, are not exempt from the bedroom tax, unless they need the spare room for medical purposes.

Nor should they be. They're no more deserving of a free room than anyone else.

&gt;If you disapprove of social-sector housing altogether, then I think you might like the hidden attitudes of many of the Conservatives in government.

Actually I consider myself a responsible socialist. I subscribe to many Nordic policies, ironically socialised housing tends not to be included within those countries.

&gt;If we did get rid of it completely, then that would tend to put housing costs up, on average, and would reduce the consumer spending going on.

Says you. Right now all I'm seeing is that a portion of the population gets super-cheap housing because my council taxes are going towards building houses and then renting them out for way below market rates.

I'm fine with paying to stop people being homeless for a few months of terrible times.

I'm not ok with someone living in a house with 1/3 market rate rent for 20 years because they got on a list at age 20 and just decided to stay in their council house for the rest of their life.

I doubt many households in the UK use water wells anyway, and even if they did my understanding is that such a scenario is unlikely (and perhaps unrelated to fracking even if it did occur).

&gt;look how cheep gas is in the US, for example, where Shale Gas is common

I think it's flawed to compare so bluntly like that. In the US natural gas is sold by production quota contracts, meaning a lot of operators are locked in to producing a given quantity of gas regardless of what the price is. Gas prices plummeted with the large investment into shale, which left many companies in an uneconomical situation where they're producing but not necessarily making a profit. The kicker being that not only was the U.S. economy flat-lining around the time shale industry was starting up (reducing the predicted price significantly) but also that wells across the board were producing less than expected. So to sustain stock prices and to stave off short term failure more wells drilled to cover the difference, lots of them, and that of course lowered the prices even more eventually. 

The shale gas prices have come up a little in recent months but in my view there's still quite a way to go before it makes economic sense. A cynical person might even go as far as to say that the whole thing is bubble with lots of very clever/stupid people riding on the back of hyped shale gas stock. 

And economics aside I'm told it's physically a harder job to extract shale gas in the UK. Plus we've got different regulations, and technically the Queen owns it all. 

tl;dr I don't know how cheap it will be in the UK but it certainly won't be as cheap as the USA. Roughly 3 to 4 times as expensive as the current US price would be my layman's guess.

true,brainburger,cnty-uk,London,"What do you mean exactly by subsidy though? A council (or housing association) home will typically have a below-market value rent, but the council or HA will still be making a profit on it. The existence of affordable housing is supported by every politician who is allowed to speak in public.

The reason that the Housing Benefit bill has increased so much in recent years is that the rents in the private sector have risen so much. As I mentioned, anyone leaving a council home over the bedroom tax is likely to cost the state more in a private place. As these are often disabled people, or vulnerable in some other way, its disproportionately harmful to them.

In central London, a 2-bed council place might cost £80pw, but a 1-bed private place might be £250.

of course HB claimants who are under-occupying private properties are not going to have their benefit directly reduced in the same way. For them, there are set benefit caps for each area and size of property. 

If you can get a 2-bed private place that costs under the cap for a 1-bed then you could get £250 for it. A person in a much cheaper council place will have their benefit reduced by 14%.

There is a written summary of EU housing costs and polices [here.](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/workingpapers/soci/w14/text2_en.htm) I am not convinced that all that you say about Finland is true - about 14% of their housing is in the social sector, compared to about 23% here. Finland spends about 2% of gdp on housing policy, compared to the UK's 3%. However Finland's is mostly in mortgage tax relief. the UK's is on Housing Benefit. I am in favour of replacing Housing Benefit (it has become ridiculously complicated over the years). However this bedroom tax seems to conflict with the concept of the new Universal Credit, which is supposed to be a simple and fair calculation. 

And yes, 'Says me'. I work on these stats every day. Don't worry, the councils don't build new stock at all, they have not been allowed to since the Thatcher years. They can only maintain their current stock, or lease from the private sector.

I agree that council housing is something of an oddity in today's UK market, but isn't so strange considering Europe in general. Remember that a typical council tenant family has all the benefits of a secure home, and they create a profit for the council. They also have more to spend on looking after the kids, and on other economic activity.

true,Feint1,eng-northhamptonshire,Northamptonshire,"&gt;I understand that argument. In what circumstances can Welfare be justified and in what circumstances can it not? 

I don't think it is ever a very good idea to be providing welfare.

&gt;Hard work is not an answer. That does not mean anything. Welfare helps people to eat and look after themselves. Your much more likely to go out and get a job if your healthy than if your starving. It is a myth that people are happy to live of welfare and get a job. That does not apply to any percentage high enough to be of concern.

If the Government gives people money for nothing then what incentive is there to work? Welfare dependence is an increasing problem in our society.

&gt;Welfare protects are society. It keeps people from starving and so keeps them safe in that regard. It also keeps people from rioting or revolting against the government, so it keeps wider society safe in that regard. So why is tax that goes towards defence ok and welfare not ok?

Welfare doesn't protect society, it coddles people. Bribing people not to riot is a ridiculous thing to do. If someone steals or riots then they should be put in prison, there is no excuse.

Defence is there to defend us, the realm and the interests of the realm.

&gt;Almost all of the poor ,as defined by our government, receive some sort of welfare payment. Not most, but almost all of the poor are on benefits of some sort (i'm obviously not just talking about unemployment benefit). So it is perfectly accurate to describe those on benefits as 'the poor'.

You can continue trying to redefine words all you like, but no one is falling for it.

&gt;They are not. Having your money sit in a bank does not count as investing. Here is a source

Putting your money in a bank is investing. Do you even know what investing means? It's clear you don't. Your ""source"" isn't even remotely relevant.

&gt;But they already have alot more to invest that they are not investing. There is no reason to expect that if they had a few more million they would suddenly invest. it is not logical. Most of the Rich's money sit's in the bank. Money sitting in the bank is not an investment in the real economy. The 2008 crash showed us that.

Almost all, if not all, of the money people get is invested in something. You're showing again your blatant ignorance of finance.

&gt;BUT YOUR WHOLE ARGUMENT WAS ABOUT PEOPLE CREATING JOBS!! Now your saying that this would not make basic unemployment go down. This whole thing started because you said that their is no reason for people to be unemployed. Now you say if somebody could take a job and make themselves unemployed, that make someone else unemployed. But you would not give that person money to survive? You have just backtracked on your whole argument. 

If you're competing with other people for paid work then obviously someone loses out, but that's just capitalism. There are plenty of untapped markets but if you do decide to compete again other people then expect to fight for what you get.

&gt;Your an idiot. 

That's embarrassingly ironic. If you're going to call other people idiots you're probably going to want to spell the sentence properly.

Your inability to spell simple words like ""our"", ""there"" and ""you're"" along with your misunderstanding of basic words like ""invest"" don't make you sound like an intellectual.

&gt;Also, why should we not be concerned when a fellow citizens becomes unemployed? Do you not have any feelings? Do you not want to live in a society that cares for those at the bottom? The society you describe is a selfish, atomized cold place in which economy dominates and humanity means nothing. Do you not think that we should try and create the best society possible? 

I want to live in a society where people take responsibility for their own actions and don't expect others to support them. I see no reason for adults to be treated like children.

&gt;Bottom line: Do you except that their is a basic rate of unemployment? If yes, do you accept that we must keep these people from starvation? If no, do you accept that whilst their will be unemployment in the near future we must keep these people from starving? 

I see that there is a level of employment and that there'll always be a section of people with not enough money to live, but I reject the notion that there are people unable to get through a week without making some money.

I'm sure they can earn enough to feed themselves.

&gt;I already know that's what you think. you said it before. what i'm saying is that the idea of the social contract states that we give up a certain amount of rights so that we gain others. we enter into this contract to avoid living a hellish life in a state of nature. Tax exists so that the state can fulfill it's part of the contract. In that sense tax is morally justifiable. What is your argument against this? 

Tax is morally justifiable, ridiculous public spending isn't. When the Government takes tax they're expected to spend it well in the interests of the people paying it. Currently that doesn't happen.

&gt;Wages in LEDC with never rise to our level though. Not without wages coming down here first. So you see we cannot compete with those countries, big companies will always seek the cheapest labor. 

Labour isn't the only cost, which is what I've been saying, it's simply one expense of many. It's true that the labour is cheap but the roads, railways, geography, electricity and simply their position in the world all all factors against them. If a company finds the UK is the best location then they'll invest here.

For example you could build a car in the UK, take it by road to the coast and ship it anywhere in the world. The power infrastructure is stable, the people educated, the roads fast and the ports efficient. It's also incredibly close to Europe. Trying to do the same in the LEDC, for example Zimbabwe, would just be a complete disaster.

There's a reason you see the LEDC countries producing lots of manpower intensive products like clothes and shoes but very little in the way of high tech products like cars and trains. Our advantage in the past was always automation and we're still ahead of the third world in that regard, we have a significant competitive advantage.

So it could well be a case of an experienced prison officer being cruel to be kind. Just a possible alternative to consider.

In other areas, there are some jobs but they're vastly outnumbered by people who want them. Having hundreds of applications for each job is not unusual, even for unskilled work. These aren't super-competitive graduate schemes with a high chance of promotion, these are just basic roles on building sites and warehouses.

And as they mention in the articles, there are other places (and a lot of this depends on geographical location) where the jobs that are available are out of reach for the workforce. Employers can afford to be quite fussy with who they hire, now that there are so many people applying for each job. If you were hiring for a pub, you could require applicants to have an MA in English Literature and you'd still have to reject people.

No-one would claim she is typical of women who allege rape, but it would appear from this story that it is fairly difficult to get prosecuted for making a false allegation unless you do it multiple times.  They prosecuted this time based on CCTV evidence that contradicted her claims.

I have also seen claims that non-violent rapists can go for many years without being prosecuted, or even accused.  I believe this.  The number of prosecutions and even accusations are very poor measures for the volumes of these crimes.  Possibly because the rapes and false allegations are being committed multiple times by the same individuals.

&gt;Again, some insights from the introductory chapters of any economics textbook offer a
simple but plausible explanation for phenomena of excessive consumption. To illustrate, we
return to the five-person flat-sharing community with which we became acquainted in the
competitive race for food described above. Suppose that the group members not only
commonly use their fridge but buy foodstuffs on joint account. Under these circumstances it
can be expected that each single homo economicus communist’s propensity to buy is higher
than in the case in which each dweller would buy groceries on her own account. Instead of
paying for the total food cost (TFC) per calculation accounting period (for instance, per
month), a single communist bears ‘only’ the average food cost (AFC = TFC/ 5). For example,
when buying an additional commodity on her daily shopping tour dweller X has not to pay the
full cost for the additional piece in her basket of goods but, in principle, only one-fifth. “Price
is not an issue. I’m shopping on joint account. At the end of this month, I’ll get the outlaid
money back from the collective,” is the rational commune-shopper’s calculus. One does not
have to be a professional economist to see the consequences of such an incentive scheme. If
the flat sharing decisions-makers, who presumably have different preferences and disposable
incomes, do not coordinate what and how much to buy, then subtly the commune’s monthly
food spending is likely to explode. Similar problems may arise in other domestic areas in
which the members consume on common account as well. Imagine, for example, a commune
that possesses only one telephone extension for all members which can lead to excessive,
unlimited telephoning at the community’s expense.",1,1363221400,null,0,1363230299,0,c8v70bf,t3_1a7i8c,t1_c8v70bf,t1_c8uy89j,null,1431577659,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge#Access

&gt; Public debate in the United Kingdom continues over whether admissions processes at Oxford and Cambridge are entirely merit based and fair; whether enough students from state schools are encouraged to apply to Cambridge; and whether these students succeed in gaining entry. In 2007–08, 57% of all successful applicants were from state schools[87] (roughly 93 percent of all students in the UK attend state schools). 

So 43% of Cambridge students went to public school. So their parents must have been able to afford to contribute ~14 grand a year when they were at school.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/9228953/Private-education-what-price-excellence.html

&gt; As average day fees reach £14,000, private schools are almost beyond the reach of middle-class families.

Now their parents sign the guarantee forms, and in many cases pay the rent. 

Now your parents - and I suspect the majority of state school pupils parents - can't afford to do this. But those parents that can and do will push the rents up.

Once they get out of Oxbridge people like this will get supported by their parents on unpaid internships too. So basically their parents have a lot of cash and they use it ruthlessly to give their kids access to a very privileged part of the economy. In the long run that will give them a highly paid job which will let them send their kids to public school, Oxford or Cambridge (43% of the places go to people 7% of the population who went to public school), a couple of years interning (it's easy to hire someone if they don't need you to pay them for the first year and you don't have to hire them after that if you don't like them) and a highly paid career too.
