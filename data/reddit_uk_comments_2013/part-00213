Passed my test a year ago this week after around 45 hours of training with a driving instructor with over a years gap between lesson 29 and 30. All in all to pass my test, I probably spent around £800 or £900. 

If to pass a test, a new driver required 100 hours of daytime practice and 20 hours of night time practice, it could cost nearly £2,500! This being put into practice would virtually overnight reduce driving, or learning to drive to the elite who can afford to put their kids through the test. 

We already get bent over by the insurance companies for a couple of thousand pounds a year, almost always as much as, if not more than what the car is worth. I've got a 1.0l VW Lupo, even with a black box, my insurance is all but £2,000. 

It's not even as if most people could afford to put their kids on their own insurance. In my case, my parents have a 2.0l Quashqai. It was going to cost me anything between £3,000 and £23,000 to get insured on it. 

The idea of a curfew and limits on carrying passengers is utter nonsense and wholly impractical. I'm pretty sure that given the state of the EHRC, any restrictions enforced by law would be ruled in contravention.

Insurance companies aren't singling out young people for high charges because they feel like it. Their prices are based purely on astronomical amounts of statistical data which shows exactly how much more likely a young driver is to cost them money, which is why they charge so much. If they charged any less they'd be making a loss, you can't reasonably expect any company to do that.

Cars are incredibly dangerous things, they are massively heavy lumps of metal which are moving along at an incredible speed. With single twitch of the wheel it is possible to kill yourself, your passengers, other motorists and people on the pavement in less than 10 seconds. Cars are very useful but could be considered deadly weapons as well. Why should someone who is legally a child and not even allowed to buy a beer at asda be allowed to handle something so dangerous?

As much as it would be nice to have a system of references schools can't be relied upon for that sort of thing, look at your teachers and how many of them have favourites even if they're badly behaved. Besides I honestly don't believe that enough 16/17 year olds have the maturity to handle something as dangerous as a car, hell I don't think most 18-20 year olds have either.

I know it's much more independent but there's still lot that your 6th Form/College will do to try and help. Uni more often than not will not actively try to help you unless you ask for it, and more than a few people on my course have been kicked off for not turning up.

The actual course and how different to A Levels it is probably varies a lot depending on what course it is, and what type of degree it is. I only had one exam in my first year, and everything else is cwk, but it makes sense as my field is very practical (Music &amp; Sound Tech(it's a BSc before anyone says anything)). The other main difference is that you're required to write in a much more academic manner, in that you've got to properly research and use sources/citations. I did a bit of that in my A2 History, but still nothing like I've done over the last three years. It's not so much that it's a harder style of writing, it's more that you have to actually be able to back your points in your essays up with some existing academic material.

Uni's also a very good life experience in that (most of the time) it's the first time you've lived away from your parents, and had to deal with things like rent and bills. That said, it's not for everyone and I know a fair few people from my 6th Form days who did less than a term of uni, and just didn't get on with it, so dropped out fairly quickly.

I was wholly inexperienced for most types of driving. Barely touched a motorway and never learnt how to drive properly in different conditions. But this inexperience forced me to be cautious. I had an adrenaline rush the first time I went on the motorway by myself, just because of how scared I was.

On the other however, I also think that some of the worst drivers out there are those who have been driving for many years. Everyone makes mistakes, we are only human. But all too often I see dangerous driving from people who are over confident with their driving abilities.

I think that there should be a limit on the types of car new drivers can have (not just young, but new drivers). Similar to motorbikes where you can only have a certain CC engine. But I also think we need to do periodic re-evaluations of everyone's driving after they have passed their test.

true,samw11,null,null,"1. You will probably need to get your hearing aid fixed. I wear glasses to drive. I had to notify the DVLA &amp; there is a code on my driving licence. I don't know the official wording, but, if I am caught driving without my glasses (&amp; I would be caught because I'm as blind as a bat &amp; would probably crash before the end of our road) I can be done for driving 'other than in accordance with [my] licence'. As I say, not sure of the official wording, but I suspect I would lose my licence for it.

2. I can confirm that you don't have to be able to hear to know when to change gear. I use my commute to listen to music that isn't one direction (have kids) and play it really rather loud (not in residential areas or traffic jams). I can assure you that even when I can't hear the engine over my CD, I can still tell when I need to change gear. It's a combination of the engine vibrations, the speed I am travelling at, the rev counter, &amp; (in my husband's car) the little green arrow (don't know if that's because his car is a fiesta or a diesel, but my car doesn't have one - I manage without).

3. I don't have a dash cam, so can't comment.

4. Because, as someone who lives in just such a residential area, it is uncommonly rude to park in a residential area and then swan off somewhere, for example, I live near a train station &amp; selfish people fill our road with their cars while they day-trip to London and don't come home till after we get in from work, so there is nowhere for residents to park. Please don't do this. On the whole parking is relatively inexpensive outside of city centres, if you don't want to pay for parking, use public transport to get there &amp; don't park on a side street near to the station if you do, thanks.

5. Yes. Each country has different rules about driving. Check them out before you go. Check that your headlights are the correct colour (France has an interesting yellow shade, but you can buy covers which filter your white headlights to yellow), in Spain you must carry a warning triangle and a huge variety of interesting first aid/emergency equipment. We hire cars when we drive outwith the UK normally, just for ease, as hire cars tend to come set up for the country you are in. Check the rules for each country you intend to visit, and make sure that you are set for it. Also check that your hearing loss/aid doesn't make you ineligible to drive. To the best of my knowledge it shouldn't do, but I wouldn't like to say it's ok &amp; then you find it's not, after you have been pulled over, and as I have already mentioned, each country has different rules.

Anyway - good luck!

I sent them an email explaining the whole clusterfuck of a situation. They called me later that day, to get a couple more details off me, and asked if I would be happy with them sending an email to the JC+ about this, to ask WTF they're playing at.

Obviously, I was fine with that, and am waiting to hear back.

The JC+ are being utterly fucking rubbish about contacting me though. They didn't even bother to write to me to tell me that a sanction had been dished out to me. They should have made me aware when i went to sign on, two weeks ago. But they didn't. 

I put in for a reconsideration, but have yet to hear back from them. AFAIK, an appeal has to be lodged within a month of a sanction being applied, and this was applied on 13/9/2013.

Do you know anything about it? I'm buggered if I can think of anything else to do, but I figure lodging an appeal anyways, wouldn't hurt, right? They should have contacted me about my request for a reconsideration, but, quelle surprise, Rodney, they've not.

For instance our starting line up could include Soldado, Townsend, Eriksen, Chadli, Paulinho and Rose with Lamela and Chirches on the bench. That's 8 out of a possible 14 players who can take the field in a game. More than HALF of the players did not play for the team last year.

Having that many new players is always a risk. At the moment we have achieved what we have this season because we have very talented individuals. It takes time to become a team. Soldado is a great example. He was awesome at Valencia, but hasn't looked great for us at all. Why? He's still making those great runs, but our guys don't yet instinctively know where he's going to be. By the time they spot his run, so has the defense.

If we're still struggling for goals come January, then I'll start to get worried. But until then I'm happy with pinching 1-0 wins and the occasional draw against the likes of Chelsea.

You can't rebuild a team the way we have and not expect them to take half a season to really come together. We're fortunate because we've managed to rebuild with some very classy players who are getting the job done for the most part as individuals.

Openreach's ""fibre broadband"", most places, is only fibre to the cabinet - it's VDSL from the cabinet to the house.

I think you know that - VDSL is just very fast ADSL, it's very fast because it only runs over copper for a very short distance.

So the speed of this VDSL segment does depend on the quality of the copper line between the cabinet and the modem, and that's why Openreach require an engineer to ""install"" the modem.

I've seen plenty of problems with ADSL which were caused by shitty internal telephone wiring, and having an ""engineer"" ""install"" the modem rules out that point of failure. 

The modem is indeed connected via a 2m or 3m length of RJ11 cable and I don't see why it shouldn't be possible to replace it with a longer one. But if you have to have connection problems requiring tech support and an Openreach engineer being sent out to test your lines, then you'll get billed £140+ if a longer RJ11 cable is used and blamed.

802.11n wifi is about 10x faster than the fibre broadband service - that's the supported way to transfer data around the house.

My ISP sold me a Netgear 802.11n router for £5 when I ordered broadband from them, I choose to use a Buffalo one instead because it can run OpenWRT.

I can max out my 40mpbs fibre service with bittorrent over my laptop's 802.11n wifi. I found it astonishing - downloads just scream down like nothing.

If you want to run network cables between some of the PCs in the house then you can probably do that using an 802.11n bridge of some kind or, as you recognised in your original self-text, by running a network cable up the stairs.

Ok, they might play their music a bit too loud and their exhausts might not be good for the environment but, they are far less of a menace than the over confident 20-30 something drivers who seems to think they are the only people on the road.

We've all experienced them, the people who hog the middle lane on a motorway at 50mph or the people who speed on up on the same motorway on the feeder lane leading to jams and accidents.

Equally, on normal roads, they're the people who block ""Keep Clear"" road markings or turn right at a ""no right turn"" sign and block traffic. The worst are those who are in a queue and decide to speed down the wrong side of the road as they are turning down a side street, nearly causing head on collisions. Both of these things I see regularly in Manchester and Salford. Road markings mean nothing to these people. Rules mean nothing to these people.

The uselessness unfortunately doesn't appear to be solely on attack. Their third goal was ludicrous... Hughes actually stumbled, lost control in the box, then realised the defender had backed off so far he could just run up to the loose ball and strike.

Kenny is great in some situations, but the one on one for the (was it 2nd?) goal just had him fall over before the strike was even made... I'm no goalie, but ""make yourself big"" and ""close down the ball"" are definitely a couple of 101's that weren't there (at least for that goal / this game)

The package isn't looking too hot despite a few strong comebacks early on. I'm not going to hate on McDermotitis yet, but there was an impression of an overall lack of organisation and drive for which a manager must be partly responsible (noting the vast restrictions he's operating under)

If the energy companies are given the licence to operate a service like this - sorry for flogging the same horse, but this isn't carpet maintenance or dry cleaning, this is an utterly essential service, providing people with light and heat - then the onus should be on them not only to maintain and upgrade it, but to ensure that it meets certain standards in terms of renewables. 

To trust them to set those standards is clearly impossible. Companies are obligated to their shareholders, after all. So government should mandate these things and the companies, who as the article shows are making vast profits from running the services, should be required to implement them. 

Interested to know how Labour created the mess, though. It seems fairly clear to me: the expected self-regulation of the industry through dint of competition which was the planned result of privatisation hasn't worked. We pay the same, or in some cases slightly more, than the nationalised system in place in France (just to choose a local, similarly-sized economy). 

The Blair government benefited hugely from the sudden rise in the use of natural gas in the 90s. They were extremely friendly to the companies they'd inherited from Thatcher: they offered government subsidies to power companies to build nuclear power plants, for example (I think 4 were mooted, each with a pair of reactors, 2 to be built by EDF and two by German companies).

true,FreddyDeus,yorkshire,Ayup,"First of all, I was talking about modern feminism, which is why I referred to 60 years of feminist thinking.

Feminists have very much promoted the idea that men cannot be raped, while at the same time expanding the definition of rape (with regard to women) to such a degree that if every feminist definition of rape were to be accepted, it would literally be impossible for a man to legitimately have sex with a woman.

While some of the points you made are technically true, the problem with feminism is that it is dualistic. Very little consistency in feminist ideological argument.

For example, feminism claims that gender is a social construct, but at the same time claims that men are driven entirely by their nature (genetic programming) and cannot change their violent, brutal ways. Feminism claims (rather conveniently) that males are incapable of being influenced in any way by what what women say, do or think. I say that this is convenient for feminism because it lets women off the hook when it comes to their share of responsibility for the way men behave in relationships, the workplace, society in general, and the way boys (largely raised by women) turn into men, and how boys learn about the world and what their role in it is supposed to be.

Feminism (modern) has largely demonised and marginalised men, while still finding mechanisms by which women are perpetual victims at the hand of men. For instance, a wife can divorce her husband, keep the children, the house, the car, and receive up to 70% of the relationship assets while receiving maintenance (alimony) and child support from both the husband and the state. The man will be left with little. No home. No kids. No relationship. And a big monthly alimony and child support bill. But because that man is now 'free' to work longer hours and thus increase his earnings (often because he has no financial choice in the matter), many 'professional' feminists will argue that the man is the person who has come out of divorce far better off than his victimised ex-wife.

Meanwhile papers which do have a paywall, such as the FT, are doing rather well and managing to turn a profit. The issue is that the Guardian editor has invested a huge amount of his prestige into the ad revenue method so is refusing to back down. The board is dominated by him and therefore fails to chuck him out or force him to change.

I'd say Harriet Harmen was 'pretty mainstream' for example. She supported Labour's proposal to introduce a 'drink-fucking' law that would have allowed women to allege rape for no other reason than she was above a pre-prescribed blood/alcohol limit. The proposed legislation was clear. A woman who was above the drink-fucking limit was still free to indulge in consenting sexual activity, she would be committing no crime in inducing a man to have sex with her, but her consent would not be recognised in law thus making the man a rapist by default. This legislation only applied to women. A man who was intoxicated would still have to take responsibility for both his state-defined insobriety and his actions. Technically, he also become entirely responsible for the woman's welfare.

Thankfully, Labour lost the election before this law could be passed by Parliament.

He put in some good performances in that role at the start of last season (including a MOTM performance against City), but with Lucas' injury and Gerrard struggling to keep up with the expectations and ultimately being deployed in a deeper role, Allen was pushed to the more defensive minded CM. He struggled a bit here but overall did OK I think. This, along with his injury and quite large price tag, quickly led to him becoming the no. 1 scapegoat.

Currently it will be hard for him to find regular playing time, Stevie and Lucas are BR's preferred pairing and Hendo has shown to provide a bigger impact when he's used.

Post-democracy. That's actually pretty profound. We've been saying for a while that the politicians have stopped working *for* us and we've been busily electing the least-bad of them. I hadn't heard that term to describe the country we find ourselves in though. I like it.

true,Daltesse,lfc12,,"It's all about options. At the moment our bigger, more established players that are the ones picking up injuries and suspensions meaning that we've not been able to rotate as much as we'd like. This season Sturridge and Enrique have played with an injury, Coutinho is still out, while Allen, Agger, Johnson, Toure, Kelly, Cissohko have all been injured already, and we've had Lucas and Suarez both having bans.

It's obvious Rodgers in any situation likes to have 2 industrious passing players in the centre. This will be 2 from Lucas, Gerrard, Allen and Henderson. That's a good set of players to choose from, but he's basically had to play Lucas and Gerrard in every game due to Hendo being needed first as outside right then right wingback and Allen's injury. Moving Hendo infield to cover Lucas' suspension saw Raheem Sterling at right wingback!!

As players come back, I can see more rotation all over the pitch.

Information that we only *know* was ""stolen"" because the guy who stole it decided to make that public. He was able to so effectively cover his tracks that just what he took isn't actually known for sure and what he did, and the access he had wasn't even anything exceptional. His job gave him all the tools needed to do this and was one of around 1000 posts filled with *contractors* not actual NSA staff with the same tools and lack of over site. That's a large pool of people who could have easily taken the same information Snowden leaked.

In other words if Snowden was able to get these files with out being noticed and they've only just been able to reconstruct how he did it after they knew where to look how likely is it that some one else with more malicious intent has done the same?  On which note the NSA has been so full of abuse they have an actually category for spying on romantic interests ""loveint"" and many of those abuses only come to light when the person involved chose to admit it, some times years later, rather than as part of any normal audit trail. 

So I find it utterly grating to hear our PM talking about how the Guardian wasn't keeping this country safe when his government and it's intelligence agencies that shared this information with Sates and has utterly and provably *failed* to protect it. The PM statement is proof of that, he he flat out admitting that a random IT contractor was able to get access to information so secret that the PM thinks making it public is damaging. It's insane. 

At the very *best* Snowden is the only one who took advantage of this hole in our security and the PM should be praising him for bringing it to light so that people who actually intend us harm can't do the same in future or take advantage of our governments ignorance to this information being leaked in privet. But no, because it informed people who needed to know, flagged up government over reach and incompetence Snowden is a bad guy and the Guardian is the one putting us at risk.... not Cameron, or our intelligence agencies that allowed for the leak in the fucking first place.

true,JackXDark,null,null,"Many competitions and giveaways in newspapers and magazines are dodgy.

Source: I used to work for a PR company that placed and ran them.

One of the main ways to promote products, other than paying for advertising is to offer items as prizes. The paper or magazine will specify a certain minimum value for these, which is roughly tied to advertising rates. Sometimes the thing being publicised doesn't have an easily definable value, which is why you'll see holiday vouchers or things like iPads offered instead.

As far as I could see there was absolutely no oversight of fairness of this from either end. Meaning that in some cases prizes weren't sent out at all, or only half of the promised value of prizes was sent. 

Now - to say this was the case on every occasion wouldn't be true or fair, and in at least one PR agency I could but won't name, it was virtually policy to short on prizes, or over promise to both to the client and to the media outlet. 

Also, when a media outlet asks for companies to donate prizes, that company doesn't care in the slightest who gets the prizes. It just has a few extra column inches to add to its media monitoring. 

The amount of entries also varied massively. In local papers or magazines you'd get a small handful. In kids' magazines, you'd literally (and I'm using the word correctly) get several sacks full of entries.

The kids contests were just as bad and were usually judged quite unfairly too. I still feel quite dirty about being involved in one in particular, linked with a popular girls' toy brand. I'll try not to give away what it was, as doing so could get me in trouble, but in judging it, the entries weren't taken on merits or at random, but by their chances of the winners achieving further coverage for the brand. The contest involved girls sending in pictures of themselves in a costume, and a short paragraph about why they should win.

Which meant that in the office when we were 'judging' them, they were sorted into piles that were essentially; 'usable sob story', 'cute', and 'jailbait'. The boss was essentially looking for a winner that managed to combine all three. I tried to subtly ditch the more cringingly jailbaity ones by saying they didn't meet the first two, but the eventual winner wasn't the best entry by any means, but one which it was thought would get more coverage by winning, with a sob story that was eminently manipulatable. Yup. Horrible. 

(I ended up getting fired from that job for other reasons, but feel bad about not having walked there and then and don't and wouldn't work in a similar area now and am trying to get my soul back somehow.)

But yeah - take it from an 'insider' that newspaper and magazine contests are in no way fair or even arbitrary. If it's on someone's blog, or in a local paper, or something like an outdoor sports or gardening or other specialist area magazine, then you stand a very good chance of getting something if you bother to apply because the people setting up and running stuff in those sectors are generally sound. Based on the ones I've seen, there's probably about a 1 in 5 chance. If it's in a kids' magazine or a national newspaper, or in the glossy 'consumer' press then not only do you stand next to no chance, but the prize probably doesn't even exist anyway. 

Blue Peter getting caught out rigging a contest meant that things on TV do now have some oversight and fairness, but that's still a massive numbers game and if you're available for filming or publicity you stand a much better chance of 'winning'. 

I'm sure no one's fooled into thinking these contests and giveaways are altruistic or that there isn't an agenda, but they're far less fair than most people think, and are utterly agenda driven as a less expensive alternative to advertising.

that access to children at a state school is not a given “right” for any religious 
group that seeks to avail itself of a missionary opportunity. The fact that local and 
national governance, accountability and democratic safeguards appear powerless to 
challenge this activity is highly disturbing.”

true,DiscoPopShop,null,null,"A lot of Tottenham fans don't know Lamela as a player. They go off a few highlights and the price tag and use those to make their assumptions about his talents. Not many people watch Serie A anymore so its not a surprise.

Lamela will play at the highest level of football, no doubt. Whether he leaves Tottenham to do it in the future or if he carries them to that level is arbitrary, he will be in the top bracket for sure. 

In terms of his play, he used to play in the #10 role in Argentina but was moved to the right as Totti occupied the false 9 position. He made use of his ability to cut in and shoot or ghost in between the fullback and centreback on his side and get into position to score. He's not bad with his head either, he's a good height. He is deceptively quick, not like Lennon or Townsend. He's more of the kind that needs a few steps to get into his stride. A downside to his game is that he will abstain from using his right whenever possible, making crossing from the right a problem. His touch and dribbling skills are most definitely his best attributes, and from his experience of playing in the centre he has better passing than most right wingers. He has a good curve on his shot but he doesn't pull the trigger very often.

In terms of his personality he's a very quiet, determined kid. Works hard in training from what I gather. His defensive work rate is good but don't expect him to fly back.

Resist a second pint and instead go out the door and head right, you'll soon find the brew dog bar, more awesome Scottish beer. Have a punk ipa.

From there you could check out the museum on chambers street. Very big, amazing building and free. Or go see the castle. It's not free but hey, it's iconic.

Then head towards princes street. Climb up the Scott monument, the giant black spire. Not a lot of tourists know you can go up it and it's really cheap, like 4 quid. Get some amazing panoramas on your phone. Facebook them.

Then grab a 22 bus and head to the shore, check out pubs such as nobles, carriers quarters, the vintage and teuchters. Avoid the ship actually in the water that acts like a pub, instead find a pub called 'the ship on the shore' for some awesome seafood.

To finish the night head to the secret arcade, just off the royal mile for some crazy Russian vodkas and a game of chess. Or hit somewhere near the hotel for a whisky.

true,[deleted],null,null,"No, it is a big myth that insurance companies consider them a risk because of inexperience. They only consider them a risk because they they make the more claims. If you're 18/19 and you crash your car, there's no way you can afford to even get a few scratches repainted on your own so therefore you claim on the insurance.

As you get older and have more disposable income, it's easier to get minor accidents repaired (and some major ones) out of your own pocket and not involve insurance companies.

It's like the myth that women are ""safer"" drivers than men. No, women are classed as safer drivers because they make less claims the men. Ditto the elderly. 

Insurance is based entirely on statistics. For example, if you want to charge a certain group of people more for insurance you have to prove it so therefore, you look at claims received from that group of people.

As I said, it is true that insurance companies consider anyone 21 and under a risk but it's not due to the fact they will be driving 60mph in a 40 zone or be more likely to have a crash and ""die a lot"" it's the fact they claim for everything from minor paint scrapes from someone going to close to their car with a trolley to write-offs that may not be their fault. They consider them a risk because the insurers are more at risk of paying out for even the most trivial of things.

People keep harking back to the US great depression. Let me outline a few reasons why this situation is entirely different, and not comparable:

1. The US, and our economy, is several times larger than during the great depression. This increases the complexity by a very large order of magnitude.  The number of sectors, the inter-dependency of even more players in the world and business market, and the make up of the economy are all totally different. Our economy has matured and is just about saturated, I don't see any more growth there to get - unless it is artificial and debt inflated. 

2. The causes of each the recessions are different each time. 

3. Youth unemployment is largely caused by the fact we have little to no use for the youth in our service based economy. We don't make anything. 

At the end of the day we can't grow forever. And economies that are growing, are in some ways growing at the expense of the West.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I see your point but at least it's fairly vocational for me. Doing a PPE degrees and then going straight into a job in some form of governmental role gives you little life experience of what the average person has to deal with. This is especially a problem when it's career politicians like Cameron/Clegg/Milliband.

- Clegg did Archaeology and Anthropology or something if I'm not mistaken

- PPE teaches lots about how to be in government which is what you want for people in government. The problem with politicians who come from 'the elite' for lack of a better term, is that they grew up at public school or similar, so their world-view is warped from an early age. But still, I'd rather have elitists who know how to run the country be the ones in government than have people with 'life experience' because they aren't going to know dick about economic policy etc.

&gt;That said it's just my opinion and I'm sure plenty of people (such as yourself) think I'm wasting my time and money.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I've watched all of the uk office two times and all of the US office 3 times. I vastly prefer the US version. Allow me to elaborate.

- In the UK version, it is much shorter, so it doesn't allow for as much character development. This means the characters are less deep and the audience can't form as much of an attachment. The exception to this is Kevin in the US version. In the final few seasons his character becomes completely caricatured. I enjoy it, but it feels a bit over the top to me. In the first few seasons he's pretty normal and not really 'retarded' for lack of a better term but towards the end he very much is.

- In the UK version, the characters are less happy. This makes for a slightly more realistic show, perhaps, but it kind of brings me down. Not what I look for in a comedy show. I like in the US version that Toby is always really depressed - it makes other people seem happier.

- The contrast between Michael Scott and David Brent is huge. I don't find David Brent to be a likeable character. He is kind of a dick. He is a dick and inept. Michael Scott is inept but he means well. This makes him much more likeable. He is an idiot and he annoys everyone but he wants everyone to be happy. Again, maybe not as 'realistic' as the UK version, but more heart-warming and entertaining.

I used to work for Hastings Direct in the claims and customer service department. This wasn't all that long ago either.

The majority of claims we'd put through were from the under 25 bracket but we'd receive calls from all sorts of people, every kind of age range imaginable.

People would enquire about excess amounts, whether they had a courtesy car, how long it would take to get the damage fixed etc. etc. and 9 times out of 10 if the caller was mid 30's and above, we'd give them all the information and we'd never hear from them again. We actually did a survey as part of a push to find out why more young drivers were making claims (the company was thinking of instigating an ""over 25's only"" policy so it was to collect information), and the top 2 reasons were that they couldn't afford to get the damage repaired on their own or they didn't know where to get the damage repaired so in both instances they went to their insurance company.

We had meetings with representatives from the MiB to check the legality and restrictions of offering an age restricted policy specifically alienating the 18-25 bracket and one of the subjects brought up was the fact that young drivers were considered too risky for motor insurers in general due to the fact the majority of claims that were paid out were from the 18-25 age bracket. It's a simple financial matter that insurance companies consider them too risky as for the majority, within that 12 month policy, they will have to pay out at some point. 

It's not the fact that insurers think ""they're going to have a crash"", it's the fact they think (and most probably will) ""they're going to claim"". 

Insurers want to take your money, not pay it out.

You and I lack any substantive information (known as Key Performance Indicators, or KPI) required to make any sound investment decision. Sure, institutional investors might, but we don't know if they were investing because they ""knew something"" or because of another strategy that doesn't benefit you or I. You *could* use someone else's behaviour as a reason to invest, but as /r/investing will tell you, it's rarely a good strategy.

We don't know their Earnings Per Share. We don't know their margins. They're even floating on the LSE to restructure their business, so there's no real way of knowing how successful that will be.

Sure, any investment could go up or down, but investing without any key figures to base judgement on means you've no real or substantive reason to think it'll go one way over another.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"This.  I also think a fair bit of why we play the way we do now has to do with Gerrard.  He absolutely must be accommodated for, he's still immense in ability, leadership, and spirit, the heart and soul of Liverpool given human form on the pitch.  But he is not the kind of player to thrive in a very quick, short passing setup.  This is why we see him playing long passes and spraying the ball around, he's exceptional at it.  Allen is not so much able to do this, but when you reign in the passing range and switch over to quick interchanges with patient, prodding possession then Allen finds his home.  He can control play and really dictate the pace of the game in this sort of system.  Also remember that BR and Allen himself are both adamant that his best role is one where he's more free to contribute to the attack as opposed to the restrained, defensive position he was forced to take up at the start of last season due to the injury to Lucas.  We're going to see a gradual change to this kind of tiki-taka play as the players like Allen and Suso are phased in and the old guard like Carra and Gerrard are phased out.  It's how BR wants to play, and it suits the players he's bringing in perfectly.  

I'm not saying that the way we play with Stevie is wrong by any means, just that when he becomes unable to play every weekend we're going to notice a shift in our tactics as the players coming up to replace him have different skillsets than he does.  I love the look of our future, it's really exciting.  Stevie Gerrard is my favorite player of all time though and I wish he could carry on forever.

BTW - Pro tip for Microsoft from a friend who has done 2 internships with Bing (owned by Microsoft) and has a job offer lined up for when he graduates: When you apply, apply for a REALLY specific job and be really specific about why you love that topic and what you want to get out of it. Link it to specific microsoft products. Also, if you get any contacts at Microsoft, try to go through them. Apparently they're fairly big on personal recommendations, partly because they have oceans of applicants - if you can get said contact to recommend you, then you'll have a foot up. I would reign in your expectations though. Microsoft is increeeedibly competitive. This friend was talking to another friend (friend b) applying for a hardware engineering role.

The first option is not sustainable, although in countries with more government control over prices it can be pushed quite far - EDF, RWE and E.ON each has more than €30bn of debt. SSE and Centrica are around the £15bn mark. You can claim all day long that these companies are rolling in cash, but ultimately none of them is in any fit state to start making vast investments in uneconomical generation capacity without some kind of state aid. The way it works currently is that the subsidies get stuck onto bills, and are paid by customers. 

I'm not arguing that it's a bad idea to support low carbon generation in general; just that the way it's being done is unfair. The problem is that the people who ostensibly care about social justice don't appear to understand how business works *or* what the impacts of their chosen policies will be. 

Labour and the Green Party support taking money from *everyone* and giving it to landowners, big businesses and people with large houses and spare cash. Really?

New nuclear is still happening. Not with 'subsidies' (the Lib Dems and Labour don't want any of that), but with the same kind bill-funded quasi-tax system that'll apply to renewables too.

But this is true... Lloris is and was miles and miles better than Friedel. Everyone questioned if he could handle the physicality and it turns out unsurprisingly that he indeed could and far better than a 40 year old. There is not one thing Friedel does that Lloris doesn't do far better except distribute the ball which they both suck at. 

Not a popular opinion but I maintain it was a mistake to not integrate Lloris immediately then, and if Lamela isn't given more opportunities soon it will be a mistake now.

Yes, these companies make a lot of money. That's because they're enormous. Profits are highly variable because gas prices and demand (mostly dependent on temperature) are highly variable, but overall they're quite low. There was a big jump following the cold winter, as would be expected by anyone who understands this market... Fines are tiny compared to turnover.

My parents live in a large house, and have solar panels on the roof. For every unit of electricity these generate, they get 10x the current wholesale price of electricity, paid for out of everyone's bills. Down the road, there's a farmer who's installed a large solar array in his field and expects to get a 12% return on his investment, tax free, paid for out of everyone's bills. A wind farm in a good location will achieve similar returns, again guaranteed and paid for out of our bills. This is the policy supported by Labour and the Green Party (and the rest of them), and it's not fair. Energy companies have to raise prices when gas costs more, but that's only half of the increase in our bills: the rest comes from supporting government-mandated subsidy schemes and paying for the extra transmission and distribution required by renewables. Blaming the energy companies for these costs is to miss the real problem. If we're not careful, we could end up like Germany or Denmark, with domestic prices 50% higher than in the UK (and rising fast) and CO2 emissions as high as ever.

I hope very much that Lamela goes on to become a Spurs legend but if he does, it will be down to performances in a Spurs shirt rather than YouTube highlights. Believe me, there's YouTube compilations out there that make Jermaine Jenas look better than Ronaldo.

Whenever people discuss Lamela I think of David Bentley. It's easy to forget how how highly rated Bentley was back when we signed him. He was one of the big, big talents of English football, touted to dominate the national team for years to come. He could pass. He could cross. He could score goals. In 2006 he scored a hat-trick against Manchester United as Blackburn won 4-3. He looked amazing. We signed him for £15m and the rest is history. Nowadays he can't even get signed in the Championship as a free agent.

I'm NOT comparing Lamela and Bentley as players. I'm just saying that when you evaluate a player, past performances count for very little. A new club means a new start. Reputation and price tag don't make a player.

true,kopking08,null,null,"As American its been fascinating to see how quickly teams and fans write off players in football. This tends to only occur at the highest levels of the game though, where competition is so fierce that having a player not firing on all cylinders cannot be tolerated.

In the US even historically great teams often have years akin to a fire burning down a forest to promote new growth. They make clear to their fans that its a time to rebuild. And very often this works out in their favor.

Doing it that way is almost impossible in the European football however, because success is determined by money and money by participation at the highest levels. Which is why we City and Chelsea benching stars or young talents because they can't afford to not to and, almost paradoxically, precisely because they can afford to. 

What I've loved about our time under Rodgers is that we've been forced to go with youth. To give players like Henderson a chance to prove themselves. 

The fact is if we get back into the CL those times are going to end and we'll see players shunted in and out with hardly a chance offered to prove themselves. There are things to be enjoyed from both approaches.

Hopefully what last year and this season do (while also moving us up the table towards CL) is provide a sort of foundation for growth for the next decade. We almost certainly have the most emerging talent in the PL. If these lads can come good, with opportunities provided by Brendan, we could be looking at a golden generation ahead.

It might be hard to build a dynasty with the game having this financial climate, but it'll be nice to have some players who truly bleed red.

It wouldn't have been so bad if the school had occasionally invited, say, a liberal Christian, a rabbi, a secular humanist, or a feminist or LGBT campaigner to lead assemblies, but this never happened.

He can run for miles and jockey players, but he doesn't go in for tackles. Thats what a DM is supposed to do. Whenever he plays RW i find myself yelling at the screen for him to press his player instead of just standing there. This is also a sign that he doesn't read the game as well as Lucas/Allen. A good player will read the game and make a challenge on the oppositions first touch. Hendo is forced to Jockey because he arrives late. the player has already controlled the ball and turned. 

Unless something  changes, there would be no defensive presence in the midfield.

AFAIK no, C of E schools yes but not roman catholic.

I was born in 1995 and in primary school (I went to two and they were both the same) we had assemblies which is where the kids are brought to a hall given information about the school or anything considered important such as student accomplishments after which we would have a prayer and go to class or finish and go home, once every now and then we'd have a religious singer come in to do religious music on a guitar.

Over here it's a non-issue, sure it might be considered better that this doesn't happen but frankly it's just a different way of life and shouldn't be a priority, a more intelligent generation should be.

I say it's a non issue because we're a pretty secular country, a large chunk of students are not religious unless they are told they are frankly. It's literally just down to parenting.

At the end of the day it's just a prayer and a story, not brainwashing into bringing everyone to a particular religion.

But they generally won't also be fighting for gender equality on construction sites, oil rigs, or on the battlefield.

true,JeffMartinsMandolin,null,null,"I went to three schools (two primary, one secondary) and while only one was religious in name they were all the same in practice. At the primary schools we had assembly every day, which included a hymn, a prayer, and sometimes a religious reading. At the secondary school hymns and prayers were just once a week. We had RE lessons which in the early years were focused on Bible stories but included study of other religions from about age 10. Each school was involved with its local church to the extent that we would go there for special services such as Christmas, Easter and Harvest and sometimes the vicar would come to us to give a special assembly or involve us in charity work.

So as you can see, the general expectation of the public in England is that you are Christian or at least come from a Christian background. There is no requirement to BE a Christian to attend any state school, I don't think. We had a couple of Muslims join my primary school while I was there. They were not required to participate in our prayers and we were made aware of their needs during Ramadan (They told us not to offer them any food. As if that's what we normally did)

The thing is that this is all just very normal and traditional in England. In the US you've had hundreds of years of people with different faiths coming along and having to live together. In England we've historically not got along with those of other faiths so they've left and we've stayed homogenous. (Apart from Catholics.) It made sense to set up Christian schools because everyone was Christian. The loss of faith in the general public has been a gradually ongoing thing for many decades now, but most people don't have the pitchforks out for schools going about things in the way they always have done. After all so many of us grew up this way and turned out atheist anyway so who really cares?

These are some stats from ChurchofEngland.org:

* Approximately 1 million children attend C of E schools

* About 15 million people alive today went to one

&gt;Any buyer will have to be prepared to remove the structure at their own cost.

so this is to be destroyed anyway

and if a never used ebay account is to be believed, (this is not a source that proves anythings less its the lib dems) proceeds are going to charity

the removal cost will fall on the buyer not the council!

&gt;Isn't this totally illegal?

i think you will find that if this is genuine then they asked the council and they said go for it if you can pull this off.

it saves the council cost, will provide for charity and they both get positive PR.

A comment's score is simply the number of upvotes minus the number of downvotes. If five users like the comment and three users don't it will have a score of 2. Please note that the vote numbers are not ""real"" numbers, they have been ""fuzzed"" to prevent spam bots etc. So taking the above example, if five users upvoted the comment, and three users downvote it, the upvote/downvote numbers may say 23 upvotes and 21 downvotes, or 12 upvotes, and 10 downvotes.

true,sionnach,irish,Filthy foreigner,"5 in 6 months doesn't sound like a lot, frankly. Statistically, what would we expect? Birmingham has about a million people. Right? So that's a 1/100,000 chance of being killed by a stabbing a year. Not so much really.

In 2009 (best stat I could find from the parliament website) there were just over 250 fatal stabbings in England and Wales. That's from a population of 55m. So, we'd expect about 4.5 fatal stabbings a year in Birmingham, based on those numbers. 

What I can't be arsed to look into is whether cities are double as likely to be stabbed in as a rural area, and that kind of thing.

This is a revision blog that a few students (myself included) started about a year and a half ago, to both help us revise for our GCSEs and help others revise for theirs.

 A year and a half later, we've finished our GCSEs and have moved onto our AS levels (for which we're creating a separate section on the site), however Revision Systems for GCSE is staying online, and we now feel that it's a good source of revision for a broad range of GCSE topics.

I welcome you to take a look at the website, and also leave some feedback here, if you have any! *We're also looking for a few current students to keep the existing site updated, and add articles for any subjects / areas we haven't yet covered*, so if you would be interested in that please PM me!

My gut reaction:  The evidence appears to show that [genes are responsible for about 75% of the variation in IQ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability_of_IQ).  Still- educational performance is more than a proxy intelligence test.  Or is it?

People aren't only interested in explaining the variance within a population, such as one school or one nation, but between populations.  It may be that the intra-population variance is mostly genetic, but the inter-population variance is down to the teaching environment.

Ultimately, I don't know!  What I am certain of is that it's good to have the debate, to listen to expert opinion and to see what the best research shows, even if it doesn't conform exactly to our prejudices about what ought to be.

However you may want to try some of the following. Mostly found on YouTube and one or two found on Netflix although you would find a lot more on British Netflix if you use a DNS switcher service like unotelly. 

Chewin the fat. Sketch show by the same writers of still game
Burnistoun. A newer series of sketch shows still funny though.
Rab C Nesbit. The original Scottish sitcom but some of the episodes can be a bit political and slightly rude.
Scotch and Wry. All time classic sketch show not offensive at all.
Gary Tank commander. Slightly effeminate soldier reporting from front line in reality style show but very likeable.

Moving away from Scotland I'm guessing that you have watched great shows like fawlty towers, dad's army which are a bit older but still great. 
Black adder, father ted, vicar of dibley, and one that's definitely on US Netflix is Keeping Up Appearances. That's my dad's favourite along with still game so maybe it's best to start there. 

It crowd. By writer if father ted is very good indeed.
Outnumbered. Modern British family comedy. Very sublime.
My Hero. British superhero in suburban life. Bit silly but still good fun.
My family. From a few years back. Was great at start but went downhill later on.
Inbetweeners. Great fun but not family friendly.

Not really. Femin*ism*, as a movement, isn't about doing anything to support men's issues. The clue is in the name. (At best, it might indirectly benefit men, as a more equal society should be a positive thing)

Femin*ists*, however, may well support men's causes - as it's entirely possible to be both a feminist and an MRA. Or to avoid both of those tainted labels, and just support the more general idea of equality.

It's also interesting that reddit supports this so strongly. They're usually the biggest proponents of the ""it's my body and I own it"" ideology. They use that argument for euthanasia and for why it's ok to use drugs. If the government can tell you not to take a drug, they can tell you that you have to receive a vaccination. But if you're going to argue that they can't stop you putting a chemical into your own body, they shouldn't be able to force you either.

A guy from Stanford did a simple test with kids. He gave them a sweet on the table in front of them, and told them that they could eat it, or wait 15 minutes and get a 2nd sweet. 2/3 kids ate the marshmallow within the 15 minutes, but 1/3 resisted temptation.

Apparently the kids who waited went on to do way better in life, basically because they can delay immediate gratification for long-term gain and showed  high self-discipline. And that test was far more useful than IQ, exam grades, personality tests or any other metric in predicting future success.

They've reproduced it several times and it seems to work every time.

&gt;The Bureau has also found that Cummings breached parliamentary rules by failing to register his employment at NSN while holding a parliamentary pass.

&gt;In November 2010, while Cummings was freelancing at NSN and enjoying DfE access through his parliamentary pass, the Department finalised a grant to the NSN. The grant, for £500,000, was awarded to the organisation in June without being advertised and without inviting any other organisations to tender.

**London:**

Chris Grayling – London

Theresa Villiers – London

David Jones – London

George Osborne- London

David Cameron = London

**South East England:**


Nick Clegg – Buckinghamshire

Theresa May – Sussex

Phillip Hammond – Essex

Jeremy Hunt- Surrey

**Scotland:**

Ian Duncan Smith – Edinburgh

Michael Gove – Edinburgh

Danny Alexander – Edinburgh

Alistair Carmichael – Islay

**Northern England:**

Vince Cable- Yorkshire

Justine Greening – Yorkshire

Eric Pickles -  Yorkshire 

William Hague – Yorkshire



**Midlands:**

Mariah Miller - Staffordshire

Patrick McLoughlin – Staffordshire

Ed Davey – Nottinghamshire

Owen Paterson – Shropshire

**Southwestern England:**

Lord Oareford (Leader of the Lords)- ?   Apparently lives in the South West, went to school in London. Cannot find place of birth.

**Most represented cities:**
London: 4
Edinburgh: 3
Rotherham: 2


**City population per member of government:**

London: (Urban Area 9.8m/5) 1.96m

Edinburgh: (No Urban Area Estimate, City Estimate 495,000/3) 165,000

Rotherham: (No urban area estimate, town estimate 177,000/2) 88,500

**Cabinet representation by regional population:**

London: (Urban Area 9.8m/5) 1.96m per cabinet member

South-East England: (8.65m/4) 2.1625m

Scotland: (5.3m/4): 1.325m

Northern England: (14.5m/4) 3.625m

Midlands: (East 4.5m plus West 5.6m - 11.1m/4) 2.775m

South West: (5.3m/1) 5.3m

I'll make no commentary. I used place of birth/where they were raised as the main criteria, and used wikipedia for population stats.

I have listed London and the South Eastern counties as separate as, well, they are separate. Only a person with no experience of living in London or the South East would try to conflate them, when they are very separate culturally and economically- although of course being its immediate neighbour the South East is economically dependent on London even more than the rest of the UK.

It's not. You can support equal rights, sure, but the only ""MRAs"" are ones which are anti-feminist, since that movement splintered off from the gender equality movement due to some bizarre hatred of feminists. The rest decided to actually fight for equality.

I don't think moderate MRAs exist. If they do, they should stop calling themselves MRAs, since the modern MRA movement is an anti-feminist movement and does not actually care about men's rights.

By contrast, the modern feminist movement is a gender equality movement. There aren't two sides here, male and female.

On that analysis, IQ is largely an artefact of the IQ test used and the testing procedures employed, because we have multiple competing theories of intelligence and a veritable multitude of IQ tests, all with flaws and assumptions, all with methodological weaknesses.  Some are unreliable, some are not valid, some have little theoretical underpinning, some have cultural biases, etc.  

Just as an example, one test, [the Raven's Matrices test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven%27s_Progressive_Matrices) was designed specifically to be free from cultural biases and to measure something called ""general"" intelligence.  However, it's been noted that tile and wallpaper fitters score abnormally highly on it, I wonder why?  And which way does the effect go?  Do those with this sort of ""intelligence"" pursue careers where their particular skills are suited, or do their workplace-acquired skills enable them to perform well on such tests?

We still don't really have a strong grasp on what intelligence _is_, other than that it's something measured by IQ tests, which seem to measure a wide variety of ""things"".  We have fluid intelligence (grasping new ideas), crystallised intelligence (learnt knowledge), verbal intelligence, numerical intelligence, spatial intelligence, abstract reasoning, critical thinking, general intelligence, etc....

By increasing the tax for the wealthy you decrease the incentive for people to work hard, study in-demand qualifications ect. As the tax goes to 100%, the incentive to study medicine, chemical engineering ect sharply decreases, after all there will be no financial reward for it. Obviously this is an unrealistic example. 

&gt; the whole world would be fairer

I find this an interesting concept, ""fair"". I do not consider income equality to be ""fair"". ""Fair"" means that we all have the same rules to play by, it does not mean that we all have the same result at the end of the game. All else being equal, if I work twice as many hours as you, I should get twice the pay, that is fair. All of us earning the same (or approaching it) it not ""fair"". To give a simplistic example, if we are both apple pickers, if I pick twice as many apples as you (for whatever reason) does that mean we should be paid the same so there is income equality and the society is 'fair'. 

To this you will probably query the relationship between 'hard work' and wealth. To which I suggest you google graphs of labour supply. As income increases people tend to want to work more hours, because the benefit to doing so is greater

The examples I've expressed here might lead to you believe that my opinions are a little more extreme that they really are. I do believe in wealth redistribution, to an extent. However I have no problem with the poor being (relatively) poor (controversial statement) (they are still rich relative to the poor in other countries, perhaps we should practice more wealth redistribution with them), as long as they have the means and financial support to get training and support to make themselves not poor (teach a man to fish).

I dunno, football fans had a bad reputation at the time, so maybe if it had been Millwall or Sunderland fans against whom the slander was levelled, maybe that would have been believed, too.

But I do think it bears consideration, the idea that Hillsborough fans were demonised because of the stereotype.

On the issue of the left's attitude.  Firstly, I think it's dishonest and unhelpful to blanket the left as a whole.  There's definitely a chatterati, a liberally somewhat leftish group of pseuds who do mistake themselves for some sort of politically intellectual elite, and I vociferously disagree with their approach - mostly because I think it's dangerous to underestimate the capacity of those who hold opposing views.  But it's also elitist, anti-democratic, classist, anti-working class and so on which should make it a position wholly repugnant to the left.  We're supposed to be the egalitarians, the supporters of working class interests and attitudes, indeed we're supposed to be a working class movement and frankly, fuck vanguards.  The problem is both of our own making and of the system we live in though, which will always give louder voices to those with the right connections, money and power.  We need to go back to our roots and once again become a movement of and by working people instead of handing off the responsibility for leading us to an establishment elite who throw us a bone every now and then.
