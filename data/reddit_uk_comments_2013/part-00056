true,binlargin,eng-lancashire,Lancashire,"&gt; Homosexuality doesn't prevent anyone from reproducing, it doesn't make them sterile - it simply makes them less likely to reproduce.

Quite right, it does not outright prevent reproduction but I still think it should be considered a reproductive disorder.

&gt; There is a possibility that homosexuality could be beneficial to a species, one would need to rule that out before claiming it's a medical disorder, otherwise you're just speculating. 

We're not a colony of ants who all share the same DNA, selection works at the level of the individual. I think I see where you're coming from but I don't think that ""society should call this a medical disorder only if it's not useful to society"" is a good argument, it's primarily a family issue between parents and their children. Parents generally want healthy, normal children without disadvantaged reproductive systems.

The reason to fight for this silly definition is that within the deaf community, people don't get treated for hearing disorders even when the technology is available because to do so would be seen as treacherous and against the culture of their insular group. That, IMO, is not a good thing.

I think that in the near future we'll see a prenatal cure for homosexuality and other gender disorders, there will be a battle between the LBGT community who oppose and parents who want this technology. The definition of homosexuality itself will play a large part in the legislation of such technologies, which is why I think it's important that the illness aspect is separated from the crazy morality aspect and judged on its own merits.",0,1364081734,null,0,false,0,c917hpv,t3_1askpy,t1_c917hpv,t1_c90m88a,null,1431681990,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,eka5245,null,null,"Doctor Who is about a time lord, a kind of humanoid alien, who calls himself the Doctor, who travels through time and space in his ship with various companions as he ""saves the day"" and makes things better, to a degree. It's a serial, so all the stories follow the same plot line of ""here is the problem, the Doctor fixes it, things get better"".

Time lords can regenerate upon ""dying"" if they want to, and they have a limited number of regenerations (this is debatable for the Doctor, various reasons as to why). The show is currently on it's 11th Doctor (played by Matt Smith); there have been three Doctors since the show's renewal in 2005 with the 9th Doctor.

A lot of people love David Tennant, who played the 10th Doctor, but I feel that 9 (Christopher Eccleston) didn't get enough time. The episode that you saw, series one episode one, was a choppy introduction for a show they were bringing back after years and years off the air. The show gets better from there.

Here's the main thing: you can start with any Doctor, but I recommend starting with the 11th, Matt Smith, simply because the show takes a new direction from that point, due to a change in producers and writers. It's a HUGE change stylistically but it is consistent from series 5 onward. If you have time, start from the beginning of the 2005 series with the 9th Doctor. Some episode are meh and some are brilliant, but it's the same with all the series and Doctors. Moments shine and moments fall flat. It happens, but it's really all up to what you prefer.

Non obsessively, though I used to post to /r/malefashionadvice a fair bit, content and quality really went downhill for me and it got a really circlejerky nature which I wasn't a fan of. Also /r/soccer is alright for info and news about football, as well as match day threads which are fun. Also /r/unitedkingdom too but that's standard.

2. Besides the more obvious big ones, which subs do you go to for intriguing/interesting info and/or news?

none really, I often find that reddit is too US centric, and although I do post and participate in smaller subs (/r/footballmanagergames, /r/soccerbetting, etc) that I use them as a way to get away from news/interesting info, etc, and prefer to have them as something to let my mind wander. People often talk about reddit as a great news tool, but I really like using the subs I subscribe to for my own personal interests and like to stay far away from stuff like in-depth articles and stuff.


3. Do you moderate any subs and if so, which ones?

Nope, no patience for that kind of thing. Though I do have strong stances on what it takes to improve a sub, and would, if made moderator, make these changes and just say 'fuck you' to those who prefer it the old way.


4. Reddit gold, what's the bloomin' point? Other than having a FULL drop down menu instead of part of it, mine just expired and I dunno if I'll renew as I couldn't find any other benefits.

I wouldn't bother if I was you, I really don't like the stance this website takes on certain issues (racism, sexism, homophobia, etc) and although I do like using the website and some of the communities within, I really wouldn't want to support this site with my money.

5. How long have you been on here then? 

Joined over a year ago, two years this September.

6. Have you seen any MASSIVE fights that've always stuck in your mind?

Been a couple of blowouts on /r/malefashionadvice including one guy who always contributed quitting because people mocked him because he said he 'studied fashion academically' and that this made him better than others. Also a lot of stuff with a certain user thinking that other users were paid advertising shills. Also there's this hilarious, but also a little mean, tumblr dedicated to taking the piss out of people on /r/malefashionadvice: http://fuckyeahmfa.tumblr.com/

The Doctor is an alien who travels through time and space in a Spaceship called the TARDIS. When it lands its supposed to camouflage to fit in with its surroundings but a long time ago it got stuck in the form of a 1960's Police box. He usually picks up a human or two to travel through time and space with and show them the universe. Along the way they run into all kinds of aliens monsters and bad people and run into all kinds of trouble. 

As for why there are so many doctors its because of a thing called regeneration. Back in the 60's when the original actor had to step down from the role they needed a way to keep the show going. The solution was that the Dr's race when the where close to death could start a process that would regenerate there bodies. The side effect was that it changed there appearance and there personality traits with it. He still has all his memories but essentially a new man.

As for what to watch the first season of the new series can be hard for some. Probably the easiest to get into for you would be the first episode of the 5th season.

Not really what I'm saying. My point is that one shouldn't call it a medical disorder unless there's adequate justification for doing so. You haven't really shown that there is.

&gt;Parents generally want healthy, normal children without disadvantaged reproductive systems.

Except you're the one stating it's a 'disadvantaged reproductive system' and not really providing sufficient evidence/reason for that. You're assuming things based on a very simplistic attitude of natural selection and to quote Ben Goldacre ""I think you'll find it's a bit more complicated than that"".

&gt;The reason to fight for this silly definition is that within the deaf community, people don't get treated for hearing disorders even when the technology is available because to do so would be seen as treacherous and against the culture of their insular group. That, IMO, is not a good thing.

Apples and oranges. There's nothing a homosexual can't do that a heterosexual can do. A deaf person can't hear.

&gt;which is why I think it's important that the illness aspect

It's not an illness - I don't know of many countries in the western world that still define it as such. That you cling to that belief despite no sound reasoning suggests some sort of bigotry or trolling?

true,wavepig,null,null,"As a Master's student in CS at UoE I feel very qualified to answer this question!

To be honest, neither of them are particularly good choices *in terms of their reputation*. Napier has virtually no reputation in our field - I haven't even *heard* of anyone doing any interesting CS there, never mind actually *reading* a paper from Napier. Same goes with Dundee, but Dundee has a stronger reputation as a University than Napier.

Despite that, I'd say that it doesn't actually matter all that much anyway. The standard advice to give people that do badly in A-Level (or the Scottish equivalent, I'm from Yorkshire) is to basically do it again but I wouldn't say that's necessary. Most people probably won't care all that much which university you went to. Undergrad degrees are about more than the Universities reputation (which is almost solely based on research output) - it's more about teaching standards, student experience and things like that. For undergrad, that's more what I'd take into consideration than the reputation of the University. From that angle, it sounds like Napier is a better choice for you.

Still, if you're really worried about either of the options, how about Herriot Watt, which I hear is pretty good (we studied [one of their papers](http://www.eti.pg.gda.pl/katedry/kams/wwwkams/pdf/DLFAGC.pdf) this year in my course fwiw)? HW is probably at the intersection of the advantages of Napier (being in Edinburgh) and Dundee (stronger reputation).

My advice from an academic perspective to you is to check the respective curricula at both Napier and Dundee. Check as to which of the courses is more theoretical/mathematical. That's the one you should choose.

Very few evolutionary biologists believe that group selection has any role to play in evolution, that used to be the case in the 60s but the accepted modern view is a gene-centric mathematical model which means that in mammals it's down to the individual's DNA and its reproductive success. There is no ""evolutionary boon to a species"", only ""selection advantages to genes"" and unless homosexuality can be shown to be on average as effective as heterosexuality then it's a disadvantage and ought to be considered a disorder.

I'll give an example. Say if being homosexual makes you more effective at protecting and raising your siblings than your children if you were heterosexual (both share on average 50% of your genes) then homosexuality is net positive to your genes and could be described as ""an evolutionary boon to the species"" if this situation is the case on average, given appropriate group selection disclaimers.

&gt; Are there this many of these jobs, that much work to be done? 

I doubt it.  Though I think we could create more jobs for these people to do.  Stuff that needs doing but that isn't necessarily a priority.  There is always more cleaning of high streets to be done for example.  Planting trees and tending to the flowers in parks would be a good one.  

&gt;Because that's how much there'd need to be, wouldn't there? 

No, not really.  If there aren't enough jobs to go around, just give people less work each.  One shift every month for example.  It's better than nothing.  They still have to work for their JSA and it still saves the government money.  

&gt;Even if there are that many of these jobs then it seems like a bad idea to take such a huge number of potential jobs out of the number-of-jobs-there-are pot, even doing it gently like you suggest, because there already aren't enough jobs to go round. We need to be trying to fill the pot with more jobs not emptying it further.

I agree.  I think short term it could have the impact of increasing the number of unemployed people  (if you just fired them all for instance.)  Though it is worth saying that these jobs would still exist they'd just be spread around more.  

Long term though those jobs would be absorbed by the private sector.  Generally, it's not to hard to find jobs for people with jobs already as they are good candidates.

Probably not relevant anymore and largely outdated but I'll share my pros and cons.

Pros

* 24 hour access to the computing labs, not very relevant these days unless you can't afford a workstation or laptop
* C being the language for all first year coursework (probably java or some pish now)
* Students union is right next door (can be bad if there's a school tour next day and you just slept in the lab)

Cons

* Heavy emphasis on HCI and usability, fine if you want to get into user applications (I didn't), but teaching 1st/2nd year undergrads Blissymbolics was a serious snoozefest.
* Just before I joined the course they threw out all the Sun SPARC decks and replaced them with windows boxes
* Had to fight the dept to even get our login accounts enabled for the dual boot Linux install on some of the boxes
* Had to slink off down to the Maths dept where the remaining Sun and SGI decks were to get access to a decent unix like environment.
* Few employment opportunities in Dundee (not that anyone wants to stay there longer than necessary anyway).
* Limited research possibilities for graduates.

I remember asking the soon to be head of department if he thought software patents would be a future issue, ""software patents will never be an issue in software engineering"" and that was the end of discussion.

It hit me as I was watching one of Seven's serials that Six was the midlife crisis Doctor. I might enjoy him more with that in mind if I decide to go back and watch his Peri serials. What sucks is that I *really* liked the Trial of a Time Lord arc, in broad strokes. How they expanded upon a notion that happened in the last episode of The Second Doctor's tenure, how we were reminded of how screwed-up Gallifrey is, and on.

But I was not in the right headspace for Six, I hated the way Peri left (I'm not the biggest fan of Peri, but she deserved better than that big guy), and... Mel. In Six's defense, I watched every episode of the show for the first time last year and I was burning out with the Classic series. I kept thinking about the awesome sci-fi films that came out in the 80s and how low-rent the show looked compared to them. I mean, I can do low-budget no problem... but that was the decade of ""Robocop"".

I hope that you include caffeine, tobacco and alcohol amongst your 'opposition'. 

I love having this debate as someone who doesn't choose to use recreational drugs but who fully stands behind a reform - even if it is *just* decriminalization of cannabis.

I've had family member die from alcoholism and drugs and whether the substance is legal or not people will use no matter what. 

There are a few main reasons I believe there needs to be change:

- I could get hold of drugs easier than alcohol because dealers don't need to hold a 'license'. (I'd say I was 14 when drugs became easily accessible to me although I was better educated than to buy) It is strongly believe THC effects puberty so smoking it as a teenager is the worst time to smoke.

- Dealers are part of capitalism and so add to this ill informed cloud that drugs are *really* bad for you by adding stuff we as humans should really not be digesting! More money fo' da dealer dow! (weighs it down see)

- I strongly believe that cannabis effects you psychologically and can alter your personality if ingested like alcoholics ingest alcohol. KEEPING it illegal means you don't know what % THC levels are in the weed... Also in the past years the % of THC has drastically increased, which also makes the drug far more dangerous.

- Debatable, but TAX

- You are very ignorant if you believe recreational drugs under the current illegal banner are not causing problems. (Heroin needles in parks, certain 'no go' areas in city's) In fact I'd say the biggest legal drug is the biggest cause of trouble currently so maybe we ban that too?

On top of this more honest education needs to be given in schools. I remember one of my 'druggy' friends saying 'the only drug that is how school teaches you it will be is ketamine' the other ones are mostly awesome'. I think the 'Frank' website is awesome but I'm sure when I was in school all we got was drug propaganda made by someone who probably hadn't even smoked a cigarette. 

tl;dr - drugs are bad but dealers are worse.

I had two reactions.

1. He isn't playing, I hope he's not injured. We need whatever strikers we have.
2. Good he isn't playing, he'll be rested and fit for the Spurs games coming up.

What the actual fuck guys? If he's not in the squad list it could be because he's injured or because he has a problem with the manager or because he had some bust-up with the Togo FA which he so often has. I'm getting sick of this shit on the /r/coys subreddit.

true,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"Well I do have to respect you for being consistent. I've seen a lot of people argue for the continuation of the current drugs policy, but not for reform on things like alcohol or cigarets. So, at least you're consistent :)

On the other hand I have to raise the point that criminalisation does not equal less users and it definitely does not mean less damage. Whilst I do believe that criminalising smoking or drinking at this point would probably decrease the total number of users, I don't think it would decrease the amount of users by a huge amount (perhaps 30-50% would stop but the rest continue using illegal methods). So criminality in my mind does make the total use drop, though this is a issue of contention. However, lowing the total number of users through a prohibition policy makes another much more serious issue arise in that you cannot control how destructive the drug is. You might think alcohol is mind altering and dangerous as it is, but it would be near infinitely worse if alcohol was illegal as there is no way to enforce standards. We can see this with Prohibition 1920-1932, USA. 

So the same would be true of weed, but in reverse. Weed would go from being illegal and taken by mere tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people, to becoming wide spread and extending to maybe a million or so people. However, the overall health of the nation would probably improve by a small amount due to marijuana quality increasing due to enforced standards.

Your argument against legalisation or decriminalisation is one of the only arguments which is hard to combat when I am trying to find a way to justify it from inside your point of view. If I was to use my own point of view it would go like this.

I don't use recreational drugs myself apart from excessive caffein. I've experimented with a limited number of drugs and deemed them to all be a needlessly expensive way to wast one's time. Even on the social front. If your idea of meaningful social interaction is getting stoned with your friends, I think you need to be more adventurous with your friends or get better ones or some thing. But that's my *personal* view. I'm very similar with alcohol in that in that It's been over a year since I last drank any and I haven't even been trying. All that to one side. I fundamentally believe people should have the freedom to destroy their own bodies and minds. I don't think most illegal drugs do this, but let's say they do for the sake of it. I fundamentally believe that humans have the right to that. We live in a society that protects individual's freedoms and liberties. We do not live in a communitarian society which puts the society above the individual. The individual is important here. Hence forth, they should be allowed to poison their own bodies and make what ever bad decisions they like. I would even go so far as to promote this from a religious perspective. If some one is religious and they believe that taking drugs is wrong and they will go to Hell for it, we should not stop them on that path. Though I would like government funded schemes for those which want help.

Sorry for the wall of text. I'm a strong advocate for civil liberties and protection of the freedom of the individual. So it's an issue I can accidentally wrote a small essay about. Also, insomnia.

There are only two things that I can think of that really indicates that 9 is in fact the 9th Doctor:
1) The Master regenerated into his 12th regeneration and was all Skeletor-y. Of course, the Master was able to go past 12, so the Doctor could find a way as well (which could fix the issue of Matt Smith's end) or the whole ""12 is the most you can have"" thing can be left out, as much of the old show has been.

2) At one point- I believe it was in The Lodger- Matt Smith as the Doctor actually refers to himself at ""11th"". This is the only point I can think of in any episode in the new series that any Doctor has actually made reference to what number they are or how many regenerations there have been.

true,YummyMeatballs,uk,London,"&gt;That's because homosexuals have been the victims of persecution for so long, it was redefined in the West as part of their liberation.

Or perhaps part of removing the ridiculous attitudes surrounding homosexuality was realising that it's not actually harmful and thus shouldn't be considered a disorder. You're really starting to sound like a conspiracy theorist here, you're clinging to the idea that it's a disorder when the evidence says otherwise, and when presented with that fact you claim (paraphrasing) that it's political correctness gone mad.

&gt;If that or something similar is ever shown to be true then I will admit defeat here, but from what I understand it isn't.

Once again, you've got it backwards. Homosexuality is *not* currently defined as a disorder, if you feel it is one you'll need to produce adequate reasoning - something you're failing to do. 

The crux of the issue is that homosexuality is not harmful in any way, to my knowledge, for something to be considered a medical disorder it needs to be. That's why gender dysphoria *is* considered a disorder - it's actively causes harm (distress, suffering) for the people who suffer from it. Making a transition and subsequently being transgendered is *not* a disorder though, as that whole process serves to alleviate the harm from the original condition. With homosexuality, there's no harm to start with - other than what society causes to them, and for that, society needs to be fixed, not homosexuality.",0,1364100537,null,0,false,0,c91ce3t,t3_1askpy,t1_c91ce3t,t1_c919y0z,null,1431684299,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,SMTRodent,eng-nottinghamshire,Back in Nottnum,"Well, yes. For example, if someone decided that it was legal only to wear tight-fitting underpants, men would quite rightly say that they need different treatment because their nuts were being crushed. 

Deciding that there should be no bins in toilets would mean that women would say they need different treatment, because otherwise where do they put their sanitary towels and used tampons.

Equality of treatment can lead to inequality of outcome if the 'standard model' of human is a select group. For example, if the default is 'white, able, straight British male' then anyone not fitting that default is going to find the 'standard' solutions don't fit. Like singles nights that automatically pair men with women, or health policies which make no allowances for pregnancy, or only allowing qualifications from British schools to count.

If you really want to understand this, try to imagine a world in which women are the 'standard model' and it is always assumed that men will deal with the kids, it's socially unacceptable to sit with your knees apart by so much as an inch, doorways tend to be about 5'8"" high, chairs are only rated to 15 stone, it's completely unacceptable for men to be angry or ever to shout, being competitive is seen as childish, and men are assumed to be irrational because of all that testosterone swilling around their systems.

If you're caught driving when banned your car is automatically seized and crushed by the police. Which stops you driving pretty well.

Also you need to learn to read further than it takes to find a source that backs up your argument, figure 4.2 clearly shows
&gt;Between age
16
and
age
39,
men
had
anywhere
from 1.6
to
2.5
times
the
risk
of
fatal
involvement
as
did
women.
Between
ages 40
and
59,
men
had
1.2 to
1.3
times
the
risk.
At
age
60
and
over
there
was
essentially
no difference
in
the rates
for
men
and
women. Men
60
and
above
had
a
rate
of
4.49,
and
women
had
a
rate
of 4.45.

So on any age range MEN are more likely to be involved in a fatal crash than women. And fatal crashes are where insurance companies have to pay out by far the most cash to the victims family.

For example, it's perfectly normal for you to walk down the street without people shouting at you at least once a week about your skin or clothes or country of origin, but that's not the case for everyone even though it should be. It's hard to realise that this is something that people have to deal with when you never see it happen. 

Once you realise that being yelled at is normal for some people (though obviously it shouldn't be), then you can act on that knowledge if you want to. If you don't realise though, and someone you know is brushing off being yelled at because for them it's the 52nd time this year but you think it's a one-off, and you get angry at them for being too passive about it, well, that would be your privilege showing - you could get angry, because it's a one-off if it happens to you, but when if it happened all the time, you just wouldn't have the energy to get outraged at it every single time.

A really common example is when (white or male) people get angry at (non-white or female) people for not explaining the impact of (racism, sexism) and how to deal with it when it comes up in conversation. To the (white or male) person, it's a one-off request for education.

The wider drug debate around prohibition not working relates to all drugs.  That debate would be something I support but not in this or the next parliament.  
No political party will lead with this as the range of views are too extreme and at the moment there is no one party strong enough to risk losing votes. 
Also ask the opinion of any mental health professional and they will tell you the issues around cannabis use.  The skunk smoked by people now is around 25 times stronger than old school pot.

They all reversed their position when the growing weight of evidence showed the negative impact of the newer strains of weed. 
As I said before it should only be debated as a part of the wider discussion on prohibition. Prohibition doesn't work.  Current drug policies that see heroin addicts being given another drug instead of a way to be clean doesn't work. The rise of uncontrolled legal highs shows that the current classification systems doesn't work.

Train franchisees have perverse incentives to stuff people into carriages like sardines, by not providing a suitable number of carriages. I mean, I'm all in favour of efficiency - up to a point - but that is just unpleasant, it's treating your customers like shit (I guess they hope passengers don't realise that in many cases it's an operational decision!), and doesn't encourage further growth.

But surely train franchisees have incentives to grow passenger numbers? Well, in many ways no. For example, they keep jacking up unregulated fares at an unsustainable pace, with the result that it's now *vastly* cheaper to fly from London to Glasgow than just to turn up to a station and take a train. I would say the growth in passenger numbers has been largely despite privatisation, not because of it. Yes, privatisation brought with it much increased investment... but some of this came from public subsidy, and private investment is fundamentally more expensive (because it's riskier to lend to private companies which might go bust, as compared with a sovereign government which controls its own currency, which cannot go bust because it can always print more money if necessary).

But aren't they affected by the ruthless pressures of the market? Again, it's not that simple. Many aspects of the railways, from regulated fares to purchasing new carriages, to ""strategic planning"" and the upkeep of the actual rails themselves, are centrally controlled ... and the train companies are often subsidised.

true,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"In retrospect I'd probably amend that statement to ""harmful in any meaningful way"" or ""significantly harmful"". Some thing along those lines. The statement I actually made is an over simplification as harm's one of those things which is caused by almost anything in the universe. Perhaps an even better statement would be ""I don't believe marijuana is any more harmful than 99.999...% of the other things in the universe"".

On the other hand I would expect readers to understand that when I say ""not harmful"" I am talking in relative terms. I'm speaking relative to all other things that exist and thus wouldn't feel the need to explain that I am talking in such terms. Surely, talking in terms relative to the universe is the default way to talk?

For some vague justification for why I believe 99.999...% of things in the universe are more harmful than weed: Sugar has almost certainly caused more physical damage than weed has, in terms of health. The Internet has almost certainly caused more social damage to more people than marijuana has (depending on your definition of social damage). These are two off the cuff examples to illustrate the damage every day things like chocolate and the internet cause us. I could find a billion more and all of them would be as harmful or more harmful than weed.

I agree that we shouldn't promote use, but I don't see any benefit in stigmatising those who want to take substances. Either we set a policy where the government decides what we can or cannot take (so long as it has no effect on others), or we let people decide for themselves. The only things they should be banning are where other people are affected. So ban driving on substances, ban taking it in public, but in my own home?

Education is the best tool, but the system is so flawed, it makes no sense. And how are we ever going to educate people when the lesson contradicts itself?

1) The law doesn't work - 100 000's of people break it every single day (some every single hour they are awake) - In the last 8 years there has never been a time I couldn't buy it (prohibition doesn't prevent people selling it)

2) It is far less damaging to society that other legal substances - i.e alcohol - just walk around any town centre over a weekend night to see what I mean.  Someone smoking cannabis at home whilst playing chess does not 'destroy lives and blight communities' Piss heads smacking the shit out of random people frequently do though

3) Keeping it illegal just funds criminal gangs - the average smoker spends £500 - £2000 per year - Doesn't the tax man sort of need more money

4) Legalising it could mean less police/nurse, etc layoffs (which are happening right now) - not to mention the fact that the starting police salary is about to be hugely cut.  We should cut the cost to the police and legal services of keeping cannabis criminalised, that should prevent some people losing their job . Also you may be able to get joe public to support the action if it might save their jobs - it might help people to re-access the importance of keeping it illegal in the first place.)

5) A lot of week sold by gangs (usually to young people) is contaminated with harmful substances to weight it down and mimic the look of THC - i.e due to prohibition a relatively safe drug has become a dangerous toxic one. i.e -

6) The law is insane - 14 fucking years max sentence for growing/selling weed and completely immoral - especially when you consider the fact that the drug doesn't really harm society - it also damages police relations - the war against drugs is a war against your own citizens. 

7) Even the prime minister smoked it - however did not get arrested. As he does not support legalisation surely morally  he should face jail for his 'crime' - just like an MP who lied about a speeding ticket recently did.

8) Anyone who enjoys an alcoholic drink and doesn't support legalisation of cannabis is a hypocrite - perhaps we should have a movement to criminalise alcohol just to spite you ? (after all alcohol does actually cause damage - you can smoke weed continuously for 15 years then suddenly stop and face no ill effects except 
slight insomnia - try that on booze and you we be seriously ill (possibly die)

true,ucvbjk,null,null,"I'm not contradicting myself. My views are consistent in that I think everything practicable should be done to prevent societal and personal harm from drugs of abuse. Outright prohibition of alcohol and tobacco wouldn't work right now as their use is so ingrained in our society - socially, economically and culturally. Fortunately, cannabis and other such substances don't have that status to anywhere near the same extent. 

So with alcohol and tobacco, smaller steps have to be taken to discourage their use instead. As you say, public health campaigns are a good tool in this. The indoor smoking ban worked well too. But there is a lot more that needs to be done.

The trouble with the personal responsibility argument is that with such dangerous substances, inevitably a section of the population ends up abusing them in such a way that it has a harmful effect on the rest of society. This might be quite localised, as in an alcoholic family member, or restricted to the local community, as in impoverished heroin addicts committing robbery, or it could have wider public health implications as in the burden of smoking-related illnesses on the NHS.

I don't see any benefit in stigmatising people either. The best positive step the Government could do, if it wasn't on this austerity warpath cutting all the services, is put a lot more funding into drug rehab centres. And also issue guidelines to prevent cases of simple possession from ever going to court; I think it would better to refer such cases to a medical professional or social worker to assess the risk of harm.",0,1364124809,null,0,false,0,c91fw6n,t3_1avxj9,t1_c91fw6n,t1_c91foor,null,1431686020,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

&gt;Not all the recommended closures were implemented. Reprieved lines include:


&gt;* Lines through the Scottish Highlands, such as the Far North Line and &gt;the West Highland Line were kept open, in part because of pressure from the powerful Highland lobby.[1]
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* The Central Wales Line was said to have been kept open because it passed through so many marginal constituencies that no one dared to close it.[1][2]
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* The Tamar Valley Line in Devon and Cornwall was kept open because the local roads were poor.
&gt;
&gt;* Other routes planned for closure that survived include the Settle-Carlisle Line, Ipswich–Lowestoft, Manchester–Sheffield via Edale (but the Woodhead Line and Bakewell route closed), Ayr–Stranraer, Glasgow–Kilmarnock, Glasgow–Edinburgh via Shotts, Barrow–Whitehaven, Middlesbrough–Whitby, York–Harrogate, Leeds/Bradford–Ilkley, Nottingham–Lincoln, Boston–Skegness, Birkenhead–Wrexham, Liverpool–Southport (and other Merseyside commuter routes), Bury-Manchester, Leicester–Peterborough, Hastings–Ashford and Ryde–Shanklin.

They're comparatively unsafe, they're under capacity, they're slow, and they're regularly disrupted with no customer service - it's not uncommon where I live for a train to be cancelled and the next one be half an hour or an hour behind it, with no apology or refund for paying customers (I could expect this every other week on my weekend journey). There's a general lack of modernisation at stations; I am better off using my phone to try to replan routes than use anything at the station. There are too many pointless announcements, and too little enforcement - smoking on trains, drunken behaviour on trains, loud music, and the general state of the toilet. They're also far too expensive - to get from the south coast to scotland can cost as much as a roamer ticket to Europe.

My personal opinion of the current legislation and cannabis is that it's;

* Not harmful enough to be illegal, as it is now

* Cannabis does carry risks, as do all drugs, and these risks need to be presented as clear facts and not political reasons for it's prohibition (or legalization!)

* Media perception and reporting on 'skunk' cannabis as some new phenomenon of super-cannabis, which is referred to with totally incorrect language. Skunk is a *variety* of cannabis, analogous to say different types of tea leaf, or varieties of apple. 

What bothers me the most about the whole cannabis situation isn't the legally or illegality as it stands. It's the fact that it's *never up for debate*.
The government parrot the same generic statement about it causing harm and the health effects (both true points to be analyzed for sure) but strangely the same points are not relevant when we're talking cigarettes, alcohol or any of the other legal drugs.

* [The Box nightclub](http://www.boxnightclub.com/) at the Odyssey is the biggest, and often the busiest. Attracts a lot of younger pre-20's crowd, and older. There are two massive floors, two dancefloors, plenty of seating areas and bars, and several VIP areas too. 
* [El Divinos](http://www.eldivino-belfast.com/) - You might recognise the name because it's a popular nightclub in Ibiza, which now has a club in Belfast. It's relatively new, and with three floors is fairly big. 
* [Ollies](http://www.olliesclub.com/) - Small, and seems to attract people that are at least in their 20's, and at £10 in at weekends attracts people with a bit more money in their pocket. 
* [Rain](http://www.rainnightclub.co.uk/) - Only gets busy in the later hours of the night. Has 2 floors, with a bigger dancefloor upstairs and one of the larger outdoor areas in any club in Belfast. 
* [Thompsons](http://www.clubthompsons.com/) - Another club which tends to get busier only in the later hours. Recently renovated. 
* [M Club](http://www.mclub.co.uk/) - Crap at weekends and attracts a rough, older crowd. Popular among students midweek because of cheap drink. 
* [LimeLight](http://www.limelightbelfast.com/) - It's actually several venues in one. Often has great bands and DJ's playing at the weekends. 
* [Stiff Kitten](http://www.shine.net/show_venue/kittenbar) - Great for Electronic Dance Music enthusiasts, international DJ's often play here (house music, dubstep etc.)

Eivissa, Lavery's etc. etc. if I've time later I'll go on..

Just realised you're in your 30's! In that case, disregard most of those :P. 

Lavery's, Ollies and Filthy McNasty's might be good spots, maybe?

It is an interesting enough comment I agree but to a large extent it's also pointing out the obvious.

How is that an argument against legalisation? Prohibiting a substance, already widely in use throughout the UK, forcing those who do want it to go through other means to get it. This already happens. So how would legalising a substance make this worse?

If alcohol, tobacco, fatty foods etc weren't as popular, would support a full legal ban?

Nobody justifies the legality of cannabis use under cultural terms (not to mention the fact that it's been smoked in this country for decades). If you support banning substance A because of the issues it raises in society, then how can you be against banning substance B which studies have repeatedly shown is more harmful.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"As much as I suspect the amount of the welfare state used by foreign migrants is inconsequential to the bigger picture - this seems like a reasonable idea. Anything that discourages migration to the UK is a good thing right now. 

I do think though that this demonstrates the governments (past and present) continued lack of understanding about the immigration issue. At the end of the day, I suspect your average Joe Bloggs couldn't give a flying f*** about migrants accessing welfare. What people don't like is feeling like a minority in their own home towns and cities.

Politicians forget that as well educated individuals from often wealthy (or at least moderately affluent) backgrounds they have a different impression on immigration. They would have been exposed to people from other cultures at university and travelling - I dont think they always appreciate the 'shop-floor' cultural differences that come about in everyday life. 

But your average working age Briton isn't perhaps as 'enlightened'. They don't care about the ""unique skills"" these people bring or how much they access welfare.

Vaporisers would become cheaper, more readily available and socially more normal. At the moment I would love a volcano vape but they're £400 and not very portable.

There were lines that needed to be closed as there were a few lines that mirrored other routes and were redundant. This however was also a time when railways were seen as a relic of the past and that everyone will soon be driving, most notably the loss of the Ebbw Vale line and the line to Blaenavon low level which were profitable routes but were closed because BR didn't want to spend the money on signalling Newport to take these lines when Llanwern steel works opened.

I think I should also mention how skewed the passenger numbers in the Beeching report were, for example: 

* Passenger counts were taken at off peak times. 

* Branch line connections were scheduled to depart five minutes before the mainline service arrived.

Now I'm only at one of those universities, so I can't really comment on the others. I will tell you what I know about Liverpool though.

Night life: genuinely very very good. Yeah there are a few dumps but there are some really decent bars and restaurants. The FACT independent cinema is great, and there are tonnes of music venues. Big music venues like the Echo arena and the 02 and ""bars with music"" like the Shipping Forecast, Cavern, Kazimer among others. 

City in the day: has the same problems every city in the UK does but shopping is pretty decent, huge shopping centre and some nice independent shops. Quite a few museums/galleries as well if that's your thing. 

Uni: our student union isn't great, to be honest. But the fact that town is so good pretty much makes up for it. Its a pretty friendly uni, I enjoyed the halls and its really easy to get involved in sports/societies. 

Nature: for a not huge city it has a good number of really nice parks, notably Sefton and Princes' Park. Further North there's Crosby and Formby beach (and Formby has a wee nature reserve). Across the water on the Wirral there's the Ness Gardens, and Parkgate that spring to mind. 

Tried to not make that too long, feel free to ask any questions :).

Edit: I don't really know about the ranking of the law course here, the Guardian Uni league tables are used by a lot of students to judge this (I'm not saying they're the best way, just one I know of).

Certainly if I want to download a movie to a portable device to watch later, then great, high speed is useful if I forgot about it the night before.

This is the fallacy of broadband - in that most of the things we do over it don't need high speed and can be downloaded more slowly as background updates.

But how often does a person open their email client and wait for emails to download - or do we only look at an email when the envelope icon appears in the sys-tray, which is after the email has already been downloaded? In that sense, within reason, would higher speed broadband have made any meaningful difference to how the person reacted to the email?

Broadband is becoming a numerical arms race where ever larger numbers wins over customers - when in fact, what is better would more more stable connections, improved latency, and for some customers the ability to shape traffic loads so that some services (gaming) is prioritised over email (etc).",0,1364138096,null,0,false,0,c91hvap,t3_1awtji,t1_c91hvap,t3_1awtji,null,1431686952,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Nope, earlier the better with everything in the UK (and most everywhere else), the bureaucracy is such that it means you have to basically expect one or more things to go wrong during the process and that's why you start early, not to be punctual, but to allow plentiful time to rectify a myriad of mistakes. It's also why you should always keep a record of everything, always send recorded special delivery (if possible) and ensure everything on your end is correct the first time and if not; corrected the second time in quick fashion!

No internet service providers would provide 70MB/s unless you are spending quite a lot.

Just a quick tip: A capital B is Byte (so 90MB would be 90 megabytes). A smaller b is a bit (so 90Mb would be 90 megabits).
A bit is 1/8th the size of a byte. The reason it is measure in megabits by service providers is to make it look like you are getting a lot more that you actually are.

How many people, in this country, are prepared to sign off on making it legal? Will there be the same amount of them as smokers? Obviously if its to be a revenue raiser for the government, it'll need to be priced at a rate equal to, or higher than tobacco - even more if the numbers can't support the price. At what point do you think the price is then too high? People still buy black market cigarettes by the carton given the opportunity, because they're cheap...so why would dealers then disappear and make everything 'safe'? There'll probably be just as many lurking in the shadows, happy to take cash off you (and more than some obtained through less than legal methods), all you're doing is making it publicly acceptable.

&gt;You've got some very mixed up views about nationality, culture and identity.

What mixed up views about nationality, culture and identity? Aberdonians will still be Aberdonian, who will be Scots, who will still be Scottish, who will be Britons who will still be British, who will be Europeans who will still be Europeans. These different identities are not incompatible at all. Scotland would still share a cultural heritage with the rest of Britain.

When it comes to Bitcoin gambling it is essential (these days) that you provide a provably fair outcome. That means you need to get hold of a really good random number generator and pre-generate all the numbers you will ever use. Never re-use the same result. Always ensure that the value has been salted with a very large sequence (probably a UUID) and store the SHA256 of this result. This allows you to tell the client in advance what the SHA256 of the next roll will be. They won't be able to break SHA256 quickly enough for them to take advantage, but they will be able to go back to your pre-published results when you reveal the UUID that you used for their roll after the fact.

Note that councils had no choice in this - the policy was introduced by central government (Thatcher) and councils were not only obliged to sell off properties, they were prevented from reinvesting the money in new building.

When my mum worked in local government in the 90s, her authority was scrabbling to transfer the properties to a housing association, this required a majority vote by the remaining tenants, who were basically suckered into signing away their right to buy.

Before this sell-off, when I was a kid, practically anyone could get a council house - you just put your name on the list and waited a few years. My local council had bachelor flats  for the able-bodied, and I'm sure others did, too.

This was only 25 years ago, and I'm sure a lot of the ""immigrants stealing our council houses"" is just people trying to come to terms with how complete circumstances have changed. When they were young, they got a council flat for the asking, why can't their kids have the same? I'm sure that's their reasoning.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"&gt; It's extremely unlikely that Scotland will continue to share oil revenues [...] no Scottish government would agree to it.

It's a joint asset so it'll get split. If 5 million people walked off with one of the nations largest assets, at a time when other industries are struggling, it would probably plunge the rest of the UK into the worst recession in European history. That, ironically, isn't in an Independent Scotlands interest, since that new-UK would be their largest trading partner, so it would likely pull them down (despite their oil wealth). I also wouldn't expect other nations to rally to the Scottish cause, given that the US will not like the prospect of their biggest ally becoming a defense-wet-fish overnight. Nor will the EU much fancy the prospect of losing access to one of its largest energy producing regions.

Being realistic, in the event of a yes vote, they'll be some sort of agreement to split the oil roughly along the current status quo. **IF** that were to tip in favour of the Scots, it would likely happen very gradually over decades, not overnight like Salmond seems to suggest. You have to remember, that although the oil is geographically proximal to Scotland, the industry was developed with money from London financial markets. So realistically it is a joint asset. If Scotland wanted to be independent for oil wealth, they missed the boat 30 years ago.

But this is endemic of the problem... Scots are being asked to answer a question with only the very vaguest idea about what the outcome their answer might involve.

&gt; What's wrong with a desire to go back to being independent?

In principle, absolutely nothing. But I do think the SNP are hard-selling it as a panacea for all the Scots woes, which simple logic would tell us it isn't. I also think, given that Scotland joined the UK in an act of union, it is essentially unfair for one party to decide to leave. If anything, it should be a mutual decision... otherwise what happens when the Cornish decide they want to go it alone?

It's a Scottish asset. We're not dividing up the land of Scotland (it's a ""joint asset""!) so we won't divide up the waters.

&gt;Being realistic, in the event of a yes vote, they'll be some sort of agreement to split the oil roughly along the current status quo.

Why?

&gt;You have to remember, that although the oil is geographically proximal to Scotland, the industry was developed with money from London financial markets. So realistically it is a joint asset.

""You have to remember, that although London is geographically proximal to English, it was in part developed with money from the Scottish economy. So realistically it is a joint asset.""

You're talking complete nonsense.

&gt;But this is endemic of the problem... Scots are being asked to answer a question with only the very vaguest idea about what the outcome their answer might involve.

The No vote isn't certain either.

&gt;But I do think the SNP are hard-selling it as a panacea for all the Scots woes, which simple logic would tell us it isn't.

They aren't selling it as a panacea for all the Scots woes. They're just saying we should be able to do a better job if we were in control, since then at least the government of Scotland in areas like taxation, welfare and defence would better align with Scottish interests.

&gt;I also think, given that Scotland joined the UK in an act of union, it is essentially unfair for one party to decide to leave.

It's ""unfair"" to you, perhaps, but it was a voluntary agreement, and Scotland shouldn't be forced to remain by the rest of the UK. If we were to do that, the international community would look on us with scorn, because it violates the human right of self-determination.

&gt;If anything, it should be a mutual decision... otherwise what happens when the Cornish decide they want to go it alone?

Then they can go it alone, if they vote for it. What's wrong with that?

&gt;Or perhaps Shetland wants to become their own nation... and of course take their oil with them ;)

Again, what's wrong with that?

&gt;This kind of modern seperatism is a beast, because its a race to the bottom - and all of its objectives could be achieved with devolution of power to regional governments.

These objectives couldn't, though. The stuff that isn't devolved to Scotland just now, were it devolved, would effectively make Scotland a separate state anyway. You can't devolve defence, for example, otherwise Scotland isn't the same country. You can't devolve taxation, either.

true,slicksps,welsh,Swansea,"First we need to know where the figure came from and what they class as immigrant, does it include assylum seekers etc. Does it count all immigrants from those fresh off the boat to those who settled here 50 years ago? Then we need to know what percentage of the UK are in the same class before that figure can be related to anything.

According to some loose sources, roughly 8% of the UK are immigrants. The benchmark therefore of 8% is to be expected across the board. In Tesco, I expect 8% of the staff to be immigrants (this obviously is highly dependant on individual areas), and likewise 8% of housing is given to immigrants. This is an expected value and perfectly fair.

9% is slightly higher but not significantly so especially given the margin of error and sources of these stats.

Edit: Just to add to this data, if 8% of people living in Britain are immigrants, what percentage of Brits are abroad. According to this [BBC article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6210358.stm) it's nearly 1/10... Which basically suggests that if we instantly sent ALL immigrants out, and brought all British migrants back... we'd be ever so slightly worse off!

I'm thinking rehab centres based on the junkie model, where chronic weed abusers who want to get off the stuff but find the addiction too hard to beat on their own, can come in on successive evenings and be weaned off the drug with decreasing amounts of active compound, administered as safely as possible via vaporisation with the carcinogenic compounds pre-filtered out (or maybe via oral administration), all being supervised by medical personnel. A controlled model of drug abuse designed to help reduce harm rather than punish - and has to be more useful than imprisonment.

On the other hand, this ""hands off"" idea of just legalising it and letting the NHS sort out the glut of public health problems from increased consumption sounds completely counterproductive to me.

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; The right to buy in my opinion was genius, but preventing reinvestment... not particularly futureproof.

These two statements are actually contradictory - the whole intent of the policy was that government should have no place in building houses. 

Thatcher believed that councils building homes placed them in competition with companies like Wimpey or Barrett Homes - that commercial developers should be left alone to do their jobs, and that the free market (supply and demand) would ensure optimum efficiency.

This was a policy that was rooted entirely in ideology, and time has only proven how wrongheaded it was.

Right-to-buy might not have been so disastrous if it hadn't been for the massive discounts applied, 33% - 50%, which basically turned it into a gold-rush. Tenants were basically given tens of thousands of pounds ""for free"", just by changing from renting a mortgage - I reckon in equivalent terms £50,000 might be a typical figure.

I think buyers had to wait a few years to sell, but I wouldn't be at all surprised if the property price boom of the 90s was, in part, at least, fuelled by former council house tenants moving up to somewhere ""posher"". 

At one time, in the 1970s, a third of the UK population lived in council housing. This was a massive national asset which was pillaged for short-term ideological and political gain. 

I keep seeing people saying how right-to-buy was great ""but"" the council stock wasn't replenished. In fact, it achieved *exactly* what it set out to do, and look at where we are as a result!

I keep seeing people saying how the principle of right-to-buy is great like it's obvious that everyone should want to own their own home, but actually being a council tenant was pretty damn good - it was cheap rent (just a bit under market rate) and it was very secure, a home for life. 

It's obvious *now* that home ownership is optimally desirable, but it's only particularly so because the council-house sell-off has completely changed the way our society perceives tenancy and social-housing (and perhaps renting-for-profit, too).

Who votes? In the main, middle England. It isn't Middle England that tends to smoke cannabis or have any form of interest in it being legal. They often simply associate drugs and drug dealing with being bad and criminal and no more complex than that. No political candidate is going to risk losing that part of the voting populace over what, really, constitutes a fairly minor matter. 

I also don't think that the pro-cannabis lobby help themselves sometimes. The denial that it can cause any harm whatsoever (it can cause some harm) and that it is the most wonderful thing ever, etc, can really come across as dogmatic and short sighted. I think this does turn people off of the idea. I'd rather that instead of sticking our fingers in our ears we have proper support systems to cope with those people who do experience harm. 

I think the problem with having a legitimate market is that (and as others have said, growing is not overly complex) you're going to see illegal grows continuing. A black market to undercut the legitimate one. So again its not an end to criminality by simply legalising its possession. I'd say that the picture is somewhat more complex than that and acknowledgement of that fact by those who are pro-legalisation, would in my view allow them to argue from a much stronger position because we'd be talking about tackling those issues rather than pretending that they aren't there. 

Another issue worth noting is the social one. Any way you try and paint it, it does have a heck of a pong to it. Not everyone will be overjoyed by the smell of it wafting into their house on a warm summer's afternoon. Again its a point worth addressing.    

Personally speaking as a police officer, I'm neither here nor there with it being legal or illegal. It doesn't bother me. I don't think it bothers the majority of people. I tried it once when I was a kid, I just threw up and I have no interest in it whatsoever. It doesn't bother me whether its legal or not. To quote one of my trainers from many moons ago ""We are not the moral police"". Which is true, we're not here to judge people for their actions, we're here to enforce the law. As long as it is illegal then it has to be dealt with as such. If it is legal it has to be treated as such, its no more complex from the policing perspective than that. In reality its middle England that needs convincing. If they aren't on board no politician will go near the idea.

I'm from Scotland originally, and I work for a manufacturing company in England. This company employs a number of semi-skilled British workers on the factory floor. To keep going, it also needs a couple of dozen skilled hardware, software and mechanical engineers. 

I've been involved in recruiting new engineers. My employer pays a reasonable rate, which is why I ended up working there. Despite this more than half of our engineers are from Eastern Europe, Africa, Russia and India. 

If we had to lose our foreign engineers we'd have to shrink, or maybe even shut down. All our semi-skilled British workers would be applying for JSA and ending up stacking shelves at Poundland.

On paper (or rather in model form) it honestly looks brilliant - instead of horrible, crowded, narrow streets of dark brick they wanted bright, open plazas which would allow people to mix and reclaim the town.  A complete contrast to a grimy industrial pre-war town.

But that kind of design always looks better under bright skies and sunny weather.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Electrification to Plymouth would be a good idea, I agree - hell if you're going that far why not carry on to Penzance? That said Exeter - Plymouth via Dawlish is the big problem with South West electrification.

Going to Penzance I'd agree, but I might be biased. It would eliminate one of the requirements to go to greater expense + inefficiency by building the new bi-mode IEP train (not that the IEP programme is a model of efficiency). As for Dawlish, some would say it's worth just building a new line anyway (if the money was there, it'd drastically help with the time it takes to go between Plymouth and Exeter). 

&gt; Only in the South. Up here in the North the only improvements are work that needs doing anyway (resignalling on the North Wales Coast between Chester and Llandudno) or has been funded by the Welsh government (track redoubling on the Wrexham - Chester line, ~7 miles between Rossett and Saltney).

We don't even have that, apart from the possibility of a restored branch line for Tavistock, and some investment in the Cornish Main Line / Falmouth branch line several years ago.

At least the Cambrian line got ERTMS - whether it was needed and whether it works is debatable but at least it's modern stuff. I was on a preserved railway in South Devon a couple of weeks ago, it's truly sad when they're running more modern signalling equipment then parts of the Network Rail network :)

&gt; My local line, Wrexham - Bidston, was supposed to be electrified and brought into Merseyrail in time for Liverpool Capital of Culture 2008. But the costs spiralled and Network Rail / Merseyrail fell out, so the whole thing was cancelled.

That's unfortunate of course but at least it was planned to happen. Down here it doesn't even get that far, it's never considered by anyone in any power, none of whom actually have to use the line apart from the holidays (and presumably Cameron drives/is driven down to Cornwall every summer).

&gt; Meanwhile the Welsh government throw money at a luxury train between Cardiff and Holyhead, despite the main economic and employment connections from Wrexham and the North Wales coast actually being to Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham...

Isn't that the ""WAG express"" - I presume it's for the highly paid Welsh Assembly members to wine and dine in comfort while everyone else on the Arriva network gets shitty horrible trains with no modern conveniences?

I'd be great if we could somehow let Johnson be our ""winger"" (in the old Dani Alves sense). Get a LB/CB that can get forward but should usually stay put. Sakho would be nice, although I honestly think Agger might be able to play there. With Johnson pushing up so much, we'd need more covering at the back, Lucas can't do it all himself. Henderson's work rate would really help out Lucas a lot. I'd free up Gerrard to push up more than he has been and of course due to Hendo's energy, he'd push up sometimes as well. We'd still need another CB as it's pretty much assumed at this point that Skrtel isn't going to work under Rogers. I really want Kelly to start working towards that role. He'd be comfortable being the ""first"" defender on the right side when Johnson is pushing up as he's played primarily RB the last couple of years. That being said I don't think he's quite ready to be thrown in the deep end. He needs more practice there and with his injury concerns, he's should not be our de facto starting right CB. That's why I like Dede. He's a young Brazilian CB that has played well the last few years and has been known to handle Neymar in Brazil fairly well. Plus I'm sure the Brazilian side of him will be able to execute the ""tiki taka"" style we are trying to play. I also think it's possible we could pick up Gamerio on loan with an option to buy (a la Nuri Sahin type deal). With Suarez playing deeper, Sturridge becomes our only starting quality natural striker. We need a back-up or someone to compete with Sturridge for the starting spot. And for goodness sake it'd be nice to have the option of squad rotation so everyone isn't dead come December.

Funding from all of this will of course come from the owners and players we sell. Carragher is retiring and it looks like the following are most likely to leave: Spearing, Coates, Skrtel, Downing, and Carroll. Not all of them will, but I can see up getting around £15m (let's be conservative/realistic) in all. The rumors are we're getting £20 from ownership as well, so roughly £35 in all. I genuinely think the above moves are possible and put us in line to challenge/overtake Arsenal and Spurs next season.

Thanks for those who read this. I spend everyday thinking about our club and it's nice to finally get it out somewhere.

true,Jimzoaar,flair5,,"I haven't seen the interview where AVB denies fatigue having an effect, I did see the interview where he admitted he made mistakes, and my immediate assumption was that he knew he shouldn't have played a few tired legs.

On Bale, there is no denying what he brings to the team, and some arguments that he carries us have some depth, but this is nonsense, the writer mentions 3 games. The first of which they even say themselves that we lost it because of defensive lapses, yet later go on to say it's because Bale didn't score? It was the defensive lapses.

The second, I think you could say we missed Bale and definitely did, but this is not a prem game and also is the 2nd leg of a very comfortable tie, I think complacency and possible tactical mistakes from AVB were to blame. I would definitely be more concerned that we conceded 4 goals than only scoring one, which is fair return of goals at the San Siro.

So that leaves one game, I won't go into it which will probably give you a good idea on where I stand as to what was wrong, but it's one game, talk about it all you want you cannot use 1 off game from a big player to show that a team is dependent on them, pure nonsense.",0,1364160170,null,0,false,0,c91o4mp,t3_1axi5z,t1_c91o4mp,t3_1axi5z,null,1431689968,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

It takes a while for people to respond to price signals. They need to take the right A levels, complete the right course of higher education, universities need to adapt to this and offer enough courses. Meanwhile how is a business to find the skilled people it needs to survive and grow?

That's if they can find the course of higher education. As I see it the desire for everyone to have a degree hasn't helped. The kind of skilled but practical person with an HNC who knows which end of a soldering iron is which seems to be missing in action. 

Having completed their studies, they aren't much use till they have some experience. Instead of training people, British industry prefers to try to outbid each other for the same dwindling pool of experienced people, and then make up the shortfall from Eastern Europe. 

There may even not be enough people in the UK with the right aptitude and mindset. If we can hoover up talent from overseas that gives us a comparative advantage, as long as it doesn't lead us to neglect our own. 

Finally there's still a bit of cultural disdain for engineering in the UK. 

There are possible solutions for some of this, and the government is doing a few of them. But to choke off the supply of immigrants and wait for locals to pick up the slack won't work.

true,listyraesder,null,null,"Except that's not how things happened, not really. Britain may have invented railways, but we never got the hang of running the things. Back in the ""golden age"", when there were 4 railway companies (1923-1948) there were thousands of miles of closures - 1,300 from 1923-39 alone. The LMS in its 25-year existence as the UK's biggest conglomerate renovated a total of 1 station (Rugby). Profitability rarely entered double digits, and the best performer was the Southern with its concentration on electrified express commuter services.

When the Government nationalised the industry, British Railways recieved ? staff (no reliable count was available), ? wagons (no count available), an aging passenger vehicle fleet and 2000 horses (used for shunting wagons in goods yards). It was chaos. It took a long time to start to sort things out, and it had been clear that steam was one of the problems. Once the Modernisation Programme was up and running, BR could turn to the network. The closures started before Beeching - BR closed 3,300 miles between nationalisation and Beeching, and they continued after.

Beeching was trying to tackle the problem that BR was making a loss of £300,000 **per day**, which is obviously highly unsustainable and *something* had to be done.

I'm not blaming you for the obvious fuckery that's gone on, but after the first rejected application you received, after your current visa had expired, you should have called UKBA immediately. They probably would have advised you to leave and reapply from outside the UK. UKBA is extremely unyielding and unsympathetic - one incident of overstaying is going to count against you in every future application you make to stay in the UK, unless you can somehow successfully appeal against it.

**TL;DR**  
You should probably get out ASAP, to show your willingness to follow their bullshit rules, then reapply from Canada. Try to speak to someone on the phone or face-to-face, if possible.

true,crucible,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt;Going to Penzance I'd agree, but I might be biased. It would eliminate one of the requirements to go to greater expense + inefficiency by building the new bi-mode IEP train (not that the IEP programme is a model of efficiency). As for Dawlish, some would say it's worth just building a new line anyway (if the money was there, it'd drastically help with the time it takes to go between Plymouth and Exeter).

IEP is a train 'designed by committee' in my book. I want to think it can work, because Hitachi are involved and I quite like the Javelin. The biggest problem with the IEP is that it's replacing the HST.

Now, if you have to have a bi-mode train, check out the [Spanish Talgo S-730](http://www.ferropedia.es/wiki/Renfe_Serie_730). Essentially it has 2 power cars at the end of each train, but the second one has a diesel engine in it. Wouldn't fly in the UK because it ""wastes platform space"" according to the DfT...

A new line bypassing Dawlish would be a good idea, the down side is losing the iconic scenic route through Dawlish. I imagine in that scenario it would remain open for local and tourist trains and as a diversionary route.

&gt;We don't even have that, apart from the possibility of a restored branch line for Tavistock, and some investment in the Cornish Main Line / Falmouth branch line several years ago.

Sounds like some of Beeching's work being undone, hopefully it can go ahead.

&gt;At least the Cambrian line got ERTMS - whether it was needed and whether it works is debatable but at least it's modern stuff. I was on a preserved railway in South Devon a couple of weeks ago, it's truly sad when they're running more modern signalling equipment then parts of the Network Rail network :)

The average passenger wouldn't notice, or care about, ERTMS though. That said it does seem to be working now on the Cambrian...

I'm convinced that shiny new trains are the only things most people would notice, it doesn't matter what else you do to signals and the track.

&gt;That's unfortunate of course but at least it was planned to happen. Down here it doesn't even get that far, it's never considered by anyone in any power, none of whom actually have to use the line apart from the holidays (and presumably Cameron drives/is driven down to Cornwall every summer).

Good point about Cameron. Maybe if he used the trains he might see the need for investment.

It does seem like the South West is forgotten about despite being a huge tourist destination.

From the railway press I read there isn't much news about improvements in Cornwall or Devon so it was good to see one of the magazines leading with the Plymouth electrification idea recently.

&gt;Isn't that the ""WAG express"" - I presume it's for the highly paid Welsh Assembly members to wine and dine in comfort while everyone else on the Arriva network gets shitty horrible trains with no modern conveniences? (never used an ATW train, only speaking of others' experiences, apart from when FGW were borrowing some and I didn't think it was really much different to an FGW class 150 apart from the seats and colour scheme)

I've never heard of many AM's using the ""WAG Express"". I think most people would be happier if they just cut the dining car down to a basic buffet car. Does it really need a full chef and gourmet menu?

ATW's trains aren't that bad. The 175's are probably the best in the fleet, that said they were originally bought by First group for their North Western franchise. The 158s had a [decent refurbishment](http://www.flickr.com/photos/arrivatrainswales158/sets/72157626379565363/) recently.

The 150s, yeah, they're the same whatever company you travel with. ATW will hire a spare unit to anybody, I think one went off to Anglia for a while.

They do one of the hardest forms of labour, and get jack shit in return. If we were to reassign half of these struggling dairy farmers to growing marijuana and hemp, this would not only provide a solid base to begin the UK's growing industry, but the dairy farmers that are left now have twice as much market stake as before, allowing them to earn a comfortable living, rather than scraping by.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;A 40% tax on earnings above £35k seems quite left wing to me. A 50% (in 45%) tax bracket existing at all seems very left wing too. I don't think government should EVER take such a large percentage of what somebody earns.

A maximum income or substantive tax on very high income earners _might_ be somewhat left wing, _but_, firstly, 35-45% isn't really a particularly high tax compared to previous times, secondly £35k is not a high threshold and mostly hits working people, thirdly tinkering with people's income really doesn't have a huge redistributive affect on real wealth given that most of it is generated other than by income (deckchairs and Titanic spring to mind), and, finally, none of this has much to do with socialism or the left really.  At most these approaches are about managing (even saving or salvaging) capitalism, preventing it from succumbing to those inherent internal contradictions that Marx demonstrated and imploding or blowing up - rather like Roosevelt and the New Deal the last time a crisis rolled around.  Now he was hardly a leftie, he was just doing his best to keep the current economic system staggering along and preventing a revolution.

&gt;Labour expanded the welfare state dramatically and even the conservative party aren't really shrinking it very much in real terms.

No indeed, but what else would you expect? Both, indeed all, the major parties are obviously Statist.  But, then, inevitably, so is capitalism and so is the right.  Without the State, who protects private property 'rights""?  As I indicated above, the ""welfare"" State is the Faustian pact to protect capitalism from scrutiny and prevent democracy from overturning property.  If you took away the welfare State but kept democracy, what do you honestly believe the poor would vote for?!  You can have a tiny highly militarised authoritarian (fascist) State, or you can have a welfare State which keeps the iron fist in a velvet glove, but you need the State to protect privilege.

For the record, socialism and the left are all about economic democracy and worker control over the means of production.",0,1364171977,null,0,false,0,c91rqp6,t3_1avykw,t1_c91rqp6,t1_c91k6b4,null,1431691678,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

But the thing that let it down really badly, for me, was [](/s ""a couple of unbelievable plot elements. First, she was supposed to be a feisty, gobby cockney lass, but she not only said and did nothing when she saw her shady Albanian boyfriend shagging her friend in a toilet stall, she still gave him the time of day when she saw him again later. Second – and this wasn't just unbelievable, it was frankly bizarre – her father, a blatant racist, hatched an insane compensation claim plan which had him abusively threatening to disown her unless she agreed to marry this shady Albanian boyfriend! To me that just smacked of having insufficient time to play out some more plausible scenarios."")

Carroll- It's obvious BR doesn't rate him whatsoever so I can see him leaving even if it's not for the 15-20 we are looking for him.

Spearing- Little brute will probably see his Anfield curtains close as Rodgers is likely to see his future midfield occupied by Henderson and Shelvey, when he is ready. Perhaps 6-8m for Jay.

Skrtel- Hate to see him go but as the season draws closer to the finish line it's become more evident Rodgers is eyeing a 1st team starter as his replacement for Carragher. He will look to get a nice fee for Martin and invest it elsewhere.


It's possible as well that Downing and Assaidi could be moved as well. I really think, even with his improved performances, Downing is at a risk to leave. I don't think Coates will be moved, maybe a loan however. I dont really want to see him leave anyways.

I'm going to sound like a bit of an entitled southern prick here, but whatever.

Food. Even healthy food, just isn't so expensive at the moment to warrant a subsidisation. If you want your healthy food prepackaged in several layers of plastic, then that situation changes. Joe Family's kids are not going to starve on benefits with the current food prices.

Processed food is more expensive and also requires less time to cook. As such it is a more popular alternative. It isn't that good food is too expensive. It's that shit food is just more popular due to the ease of use and time required. 

Now. If you want both the advantage of processed and quality of healthy, then you are going to pay a premium. In my opinion, that is a market choice in purchasing a luxury item and not something the government should be getting involved in.

Skrtel's time may be up, he doesn't seem comfortable here at the moment. He has been a great servant to us though, signed a new contract last summer so I can see us getting over 12m for him (signed him for 7). Probably best for all parties.

Downing may be offered out but I can't think of many Premier League teams who would be willing to pay for him, he is on 80k so it would be difficult to get rid of him. Saying that, he has been in good form and looks reliable nowadays. He is in his prime, and offers us a different option to the rest of the players in the squad as he is reliable on the ball and defensively, and keeps the width. I can see Rodgers trying to replace him with someone young who can offer something more in line with his ideology.

Reina is a possible target for Barca though I would be surprised if he left given his recent comments and because Valdes' contract is up next summer rather than this.

Spearing, Carroll should leave provided we find takers.

I can tell if someone's from Liverpool for example, some parts of London, etc, whereas most Americans think you all speak with one accent, ""English Accent"". When I was bored at my old job I used to serve the customers in a Southern-type accent and my co-workers would laugh hysterically (they couldn't pull it off though), it was good fun. Eventually I got kind of good and a tourist from Lancaster showed up and ask how I got to Hawaii and what I was doing working in a shop of all places. I had to tell him the accent was fake. I'm usually shy to do it around Brits though.

One of the reasons I started becoming interested in the UK is my grandparents are from Dover and I'm always interested in history and family and I would constantly ask them questions about their ""home"" as they still referred to it. And I watched Monty Python as a kid.

Here in Hawaii we use a lot of English terms for some reason, rubbish instead of trash for instance. We have a very different accent than regular Americans and a lot of the time if someone's is really thick they can't understand a word you're saying. A lot of us use different accents depending on who we're speaking to because of that.

If you're wanting bars for drinking and social atmosphere I would reccommend the more local stuff. Why come all the way over here and just go to weatherspoons eh. I lived in nottingham at uni, and our local bars are great compared to the chain pubs I'd have been more familiar with at uni. 

I would reccommend the following more traditional/irish/local type places:

The Crown
Whites tavern
Duke of york
John Hewitt 
The Spaniard
The empire
Mchughes
Kellys cellars
Kitchen bar

These are a few more modern (more youthful maybe?) places that are also very ""belfast"":

Cuckoo 
Laverys 
Filthy mcnastys 
Botanic inn
Limelight 
Stiff kitten

There are PLENTY of places to go! But as a kindred spirit of Reddit, I'd say you'll have a better night at these sorts of places rather than the club's. I don't really go to them anyways so my opinion wouldn't be the best! 

If you want some activities for the afternoon let me know, and I'll reccommend some stuff about town.

Going off the classic timeline, the doctor should have been around 1100 when *Rose* rolls around. But the show decided to make him 900 again. Just cause it sounds better, in the same way that TV characters are often made 29 instead of 31?

Then in *Empty Child* the Doctor says he's had 900 years of travel.  That reconciles things, you'd just need to assume that the Doctor decided at one point that he was going to start counting his life when he left Gallifrey.

But then the Master, one of the only people in the Universe who would know, says the Doctor is 900 years old, and he starts giving his age down to the year(903) in *Voyage of the Damned.* So its official again that the timelines don't match.

But then he goes and has 200 years of adventures off camera between *The God Complex* and *Closing Time,* so he's back to 1103.  ",0,1364190895,null,0,false,0,c91xgcr,t3_1aygk4,t1_c91xgcr,t3_1aygk4,null,1431694431,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

[ADDITIONAL Arrow Spoilers do not hover over unless you are caught up through SEASON 1, EPISODE 17](/s ""And that's just what's been told of what happened OFF camera. Malcolm's also had Walter kidnapped, and impersonated Green Arrow/tried to kill Oliver. Malcolm's strained relationship with Tommy has ultimately led Tommy to discovering Oliver's secret persona. That entire episode, by the way, was centered around Malcolm's attempted assassination. Now with Sara being potentially brought back, and Mrs. Lance entering the show, an entire new plot line is being created from Malcolm's actions. Malcolm is one of the show's few repeating villains with a ""plan"" bigger than family revenge or assassin-for-hire. He's not a main cast member but he's quite possibly more important than half of them."")

true,[deleted],null,null,"Tobacco doesn't cause anything like acute cannabis psychosis, how are you going to prevent people from getting sick through cannabis psychosis or exacerbating preexisting mental health conditions?  I'm pretty certain this would matter to someone who cares for someone who lives with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia when various studies suggest it can exacerbate preexisting mental health conditions  such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, it can also cause psychosis in healthy people.  So you have a substance that people can cause dependence in some and that can make some people ill. I would want a fairly rigid control structure around that if I was permitting the sale of this to the general public. I would also want the safer version with more balanced thc/cdb ratios so government supplied cannabis distributed through government outlets would be my preferred approach. Even the Dutch have limited the  thc levels allowed to be sold in coffee shops http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15225270

1) licensing provides a way of preventing people from obtaining cannabis if it causes health problems. 

2) licensing provides extra funds for the health service to cover the costs of rehabilitation from dependence.

Providing there are controls around a potentially dangerous substance which causes dependency I have no problem with legalisation. Just simply decriminalising isnt a valid way forward imho.

true,CTypo,silence,Silence,"The problem with consulting the Old Who is that the Doctor has some sort of Time Lord Alzheimer's which causes him to forget his age. 

Just to clarify your point about him supposed to have been 1,100 in *Rose*: In The Ribos Operation (4th Doctor, Season 16, Story 1), the Doctor claims he's been travelling for 523 years, and that he's 756 years old. This means that he was 233 when he left Gallifrey.

http://www.chakoteya.net/doctorwho/16-1.htm
http://www.chakoteya.net/doctorwho/16-2.htm

&gt;DOCTOR: I'm not old. What? 

&gt;ROMANA: Seven hundred and fifty nine? 

&gt;DOCTOR: Seven hundred and fifty six. That's not old, that's just mature. 

and

&gt;DOCTOR: Listen, have you any idea how long I've been operating this Tardis? 

&gt;ROMANA: Five hundred and twenty three years. 

&gt;DOCTOR: Right! Is it really that long? My, how time flies. 

So when The Empty Child marks him as travelling for 900 years, that should mark him as 1,156 years old (roughly). Fifty three years older than he marks himself in New Who when he's [Season 6 Spoilers](/s ""supposed to die"").

But then there's Season 7, and his weird adventures in between ""visiting"" his companions which is apparently now a thing. He was 1,103 at the end of Season 6, but he marked himself as 1,200 in ""A Town Called Mercy"". 

http://jpgr.livejournal.com/145205.html

&gt;DOCTOR:
I've matured. I'm 1,200 years old now. Plus, I don't want to miss “The Archers”. (stands, picks up Stetson and heads for door)

Then in The Snowmen, he says that he's been ""saving the universe"" for over a thousand years. So this kinda puts a wrench in your ""counting his life when he left Gallifrey"" theory because the writers of this show can't keep a timeline straight in a story about a time traveler.

http://www.chakoteya.net/doctorwho/33-6.htm

&gt;DOCTOR: It is not our problem. Over a thousand years of saving the universe, Strax, you know the one thing I learned? The universe doesn't care. 

So if we go by your theory of him counting when he left with the TARDIS, he's roughly 1,000 years old now. If we go by how old The Doctor says he is, then he is anywhere between 900 and 1,200. If we go by Old Who's numbers and New Who's timeline, he's 1,356.

So was my rented flat that I moved out of. People move - nobody can live in the same house for 20 years unless they buy it. A landlord might want it back, you might lose your job. A divorce, circumstances change and you deal with it. 

Your friend can move a 20 min train ride outside of London and have himself a nice one bed flat. Probably even a small house for the cost of a 1 bed in London. 

Fact is - that probably never crossed his mind, because he's clearly too selfish to see the big picture and deems himself unworthy of living anywhere but central London.

This kind of attitude is really awful and is the same as your mate in Hackney who was affected by this same reform, and didn't want to move out of his flat he couldn't afford because his family/friends were close by. Well guess what - these are choices people make all over the world. I don't see why a safety net (because that's what our welfare system is a, a NET, not a way of life) should allow you spare bedrooms in central London.

Many people feel disgust, shame or embarrassment about their problem (it is in Stephen Fry's words a bit like a genital wart)  Ironically often the problem is exacerbated by NOT talking about it.  The more we bottle stuff up the more pressure it exerts in our heads. 

This is especially true for young men - sadly we still have a culture that mostly conditions men to shut up and put up - that expressing feelings or talking about personal issues is a sign of weakness or failure.  

Hence the other problem of men dying earlier mostly because they just don't go to the doctors for similar reasons of being perceived as weak or failing. 

I could give you a litany of reasons people contact Sams - (and just to let people know we are also contactable by email, text message and walk ins for larger branches) but almost all boil down to the caller feeling they can not talk about their problem with anyone else.

I'd really recommend a credit union if you're looking for a loan. Their interest rates are a lot more reasonable than most banks, and since their emphasis is on saving, they make it easy for you to save!

I recently got my Experian credit report, and my overdrafts were actually listed as a line of credit on my report (which thinking about it now, does make sense), so I really don't think it will make much of a difference when applying for loans. 

If you think you can remember to cancel, then sign up for the Experian 30 day free trial. It takes a few working days to get the letter with the pin in it, but once you can get access to your report they also have a search that matches you to credit cards and loans and whatever else you're looking for. It's really good for comparing rates and fees etc. But only only only do it if you remember to cancel before the 30 days, otherwise they start charging you £15 a month.

If you can spare time, get out there and get some work experience done. You will likely need to volunteer. I would advise asking at the smaller companies perhaps.

Don't be afraid to travel and relocate. There are lots of people in your position in Manchester, who from my experience will not travel to places as close as Liverpool and Warrington. Why not? It's your first position in your career path, you need to chase it rather than waiting for the ideal opportunity to come to you. Your first job is highly unlikely to be the one you want/keep for the rest of your life so be prepared to take something a rung below what you ideally want.

One of the things I love about getting into American series (currently Archer is my favourite, and I'm about to watch all of Bob's Burgers) is that when they're consistently good, there's like 20 episodes a season. For example, Archer is on season 4, I believe, and has a lot more episodes than my favourite British TV show (Peep Show), which has just finished season 8.

However, on the other hand, due to the brevity - and the fact that more often than not it's only one person or two people writing the entire series - British TV, especially sitcom, is more consistently good, because each episode is given so much more time and effort to be worked on, and also has a lot more individuality, personality and uniqueness.

&gt;http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/Pages/about/faqs.aspx
&gt;
&gt;Are Scottish &amp; Northern Ireland notes ""legal tender""?
&gt;In short ‘No’ these notes are not ""legal tender""; furthermore, **Bank of England notes are only legal tender in England and Wales**.  Legal tender has, however, a very narrow technical meaning in relation to the settlement of debt.  If a debtor pays in legal tender the exact amount he/she owes under the terms of a contract (and in accordance with its terms), or pays this amount into court, he/she has good defence in law if he/she is sued for non-payment of the debt.
&gt;
&gt;In ordinary everyday transactions, the term ""legal tender"" in its purest sense need not govern a note's acceptability in transactions.  The acceptability of a Scottish or Northern Ireland note as a means of payment is essentially a matter for agreement between the parties involved. If both parties are in agreement, Scottish and Northern Ireland notes can be used in England and Wales.  Holders of genuine Scottish and Northern Ireland notes are provided with a level of protection similar to that provided to holders of Bank of England notes.  This is because the issuing banks must back their note issue using a combination of Bank of England notes, UK coin and funds in an interest bearing bank account at the Bank of England.

I know a lot of people here would prefer to hang on to pretty much the entire squad, but that just isn't feasible in a business sense. We have to get rid of players who aren't performing at the level we want. If we want to be in the CL, then the players who aren't up to CL standards have to go elsewhere..so that we can afford to buy players who ARE Champions League quality. 

Now that we have gotten that out of the way. Skrtel should be sold. He isn't performing well and there are many CD's that are better that we could purchase. I love him as a person, but this is a business. Next on the chopping block is Carroll. He doesn't fit our playing style. Next on the list is Coates. We become immediately vulnerable as soon as he gets on the pitch. Up next is Brad Jones. Great guy, but we could afford better. Joe Allen needs to really improve soon or he also goes on the list. I doubt we will sell him, though, because BR seems to like him a lot.

August 30th 1937

Prof. Daniel asked for a message from me to the readers of Y Ddraig Goch and to the members of the Blaid Genedlaethol Gymreig.['Welsh National Party']
Don't expect anything passionate or unusual from us. Three simple and ordinary men that saw work to do for their country, and did it, and will take the consequences happily, and who come home now to look forward to the next task: that's who Valentine and DJ Williams and I are.
	I don't yet know much of what happened in Wales over the past eight months. We couldn't read any Welsh magazines or newspapers, and we didn't hear - except in letters from home some two times every three weeks - about the history and the growth of the Welsh national movement. But this is the truth, - whatever the trouble or worries of our colleagues in Wales over the past few months, I had the privilege of the company of the two Welshmen who were the most complete, most cheerful, most lively their wit and lightest their hearts that I ever met in my life: the Rev. Lewis Valentine and Mr. DJ Williams. They weren't shaken by anything, their banter and laughing never ceased. From its inception, joviality[better word probably possible?] was one of the aims of the Plaid Genedlaethol Gymreig, but in Wormwood Scrubs this joviality grew into a lovely brightness in the middle of the greyness of the environment. Bitterness is no longer possible. To our enemies we wish long life, health and improved mind, and to our friends we wish an increase in strength and determination and diligence.

The Social Democratic and Communist parties in Germany were arguably the most powerful left wing movements in Europe during the inter-war years. Germany had a history of strong working class movements. In the inter wars years there were several very serious attempts at communist insurrection (google the Spartacist uprising)

The unions and social groups linked with both had many of the communal subculture characteristics you might associate with the nazis (schools, social clubs, their own press, their own version of history, communal sport/hiking trips etc). They pioneered that stuff, although you could argue it was a kind of secular version of religious communal activity.

What the fascists successfully achieved was to take all that, but replace the ideal of internationalism with the unfortunately much stronger ideal of nationalism. The uncomfortable fact is that many of those who made up the ranks of the nazis were former leftists. This was true in the UK also: Oswald Mosley was originally in the ILP.

It's complicated because the nazis were in part a reaction against the left wing movements but were also fuelled by the same societal pressures towards anti-individualistic and anti-capitalist organisation.

Basically, capitalism was going through global crisis, and this in addition to the punitive measures of the Treaty of Versailles, gave the (accurate) impression in Germany that the system was working. Therefore anti-capitalist movements popular. 

The left failed where the right succeeded because of a) the intrinsic power of nationalism as an ideological pole of attraction and b) the critical split between the communists and the SDP.

(The communists argued until the last minute that the SDP were 'social fascists' and the nazis were not a real threat.)",0,1364213945,null,0,1364214993,0,c920ejc,t3_1ayu0s,t1_c920ejc,t1_c9205gu,null,1431695885,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Newspapers and MP's get bombarded with this stuff day in, day out so unless you happen to be a really, really good writer (like Hemmingway good) the brutal truth that it probably won't see the light of day. In short, there's a massive oversupply of ranty, ragey blogs at the moment and no matter how valid your anger is, the internet has developed a tin ear for this sort of thing.

Instead, think about what you could do differently. Is there something about your position/stance that's unique? Is there a way of making your point that isn't being done right now (so maybe taking an absurdist or observational angle)?

If I went to buy something like that from a shop, I'd be looking at £1000+ (not including the chairs).

Those chairs would be about £20+ each in quantity. Probably much more for those, they look like they are in good condition and not just solid plastic.

Of course your problem is that the table is fucking massive, heavy, difficult (££) to move, and probably difficult to find a buyer for it.

This makes the sale difficult because you're looking for a very narrow range of potential buyers. The sort of person/company who can afford to house that table can probably buy a brand new one, and probably doesn't want a second hand one.
 
First of all, put it on EBay with a price that you'd be happy to sell it for. Also, get a quote to deliver it. People like it when their problems are already solved.

You might want to try cold calling estates  (wealthy estates, not housing estates), or any other houses that might be able to accommodate this and see if you can strike a deal. How much time do you have to sell it?

Does the table have a history? Heritage? That's a selling point.

Maybe try a law firm? University?

Otherwise a school might be able to use it, or a social club. Think of somewhere big, with lots of people who would sit around a big table.

Otherwise try a furniture shop/maker. They might be able to use the timber. ",0,1364214566,null,0,1364215570,0,c920hwr,t3_1ayub2,t1_c920hwr,t3_1ayub2,null,1431695929,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

That situation was already a criminal offence, for which the trespassers could be arrested. If it was your own home, in which you lived, the police could be called the moment after you asked them to leave and you refused. 

The painful civil process bandied about by tabloids was only relevant to *empty* properties. You categorically could not occupy another person's home.

&gt;The reality is though if people are squatting in a derelict building who will report them to the police? 

Did you not read [the article](http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kent_messenger/news/2013/february/28/frozen_man.aspx) linked at the top? The neighbors will report it if they see someone they don't like, and the homeless person who was hurting no one will freeze on the doorstep.

In the previous scenario the residents would have had to ask him to leave. How is the current situation possibly better than the previous?

&gt;Looks like it works fine to me. Obviously police should be lenient if any busy bodies report squatters living in a derelict building. The law clearly exists to protect people who actually want to use their property (that they own) for something. Whats so unreasonable about that again?

That is not what the current law does. That is what the OLD law did. The current law criminalises people who are squatting in empty, unused buildings, and has put young people, with no criminal record, who had had no warning, in prison for using them.

&gt;Obviously police should be lenient if any busy bodies report squatters living in a derelict building.

On what grounds? Not allowing busybody neighbours to report was the previous law. Parliament consciously changed that, criminalizing everyone who squats in empty or abandoned houses.

true,ArtistEngineer,australia,Cambridgeshire,"I don't think so. I can't find any information on their Wiki page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TalkTalk_Group

All telcos share/lease/wholesale different parts of the network anyway.

Usually the telco you give money to owns the [DSLAM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_subscriber_line_access_multiplexer)s in the exchange, and they lease the uplink (fibre) and downlink (copper) from someone else. Then they provide the termination equipment for your home (ADSL Router). So lots can (and does) go wrong inbetween.  Wires break, terminations get corrosion, technicians can mess with the DSLAM, water ingress in pits/cables ... 

Here's an example of a problem: ADSL line starts to lose speed and increase in noise. Possible cause: corrosion build up on copper connectors in the phone socket. Solution: lift the receiver on your telephone. This causes a high voltage on the wires and this can ""remake"" the connection. Now that people barely use their landlines any more, this ""cleaning"" of the terminals doesn't happen any more.

I've been using ADSL since 1998 in Australia and the UK. Shit happens all the time, and it can take some convincing to put the problem right. 

That's why it's really hard to get resolution when there's a major problem.

It usually costs them a lot of money to physically visit an exchange to check their equipment. So they prefer to avoid this at all costs. My worst experience took 7 weeks to resolve. They went to the exchange on day 1 of my problem, fiddled with the DSLAM and messed up the settings. Then it took 7 weeks for me to convince them to revisit the exchange and fix it. This was a well known and respected Australian ISP.

Message to Y Ddraig Goch [something]

The 'Sawdl y Fuwch Symbol'[Literally 'Heel of the cow'. Cowslip.]

Myself and two friends were in prison for seven months. At the start, we felt the whole thing was awkward and strange, and [something] difficult to suffer. But slowly, I, like every other man there, began to familiarise myself with the situation, and to look at the plank bed, the thin porridge and the ugly sound of the keys as natural elements of my life. I can imagine someone with a lethargic[?] soul after being there for a long time starting to even like the place. As he acclimatised more and more to the system, he might, on the surface, come to feel happier. But this would be a sign of the revolt inside him slowly being silenced; the flame of his true humanity burning out. Indeed, I heard one of my co-prisoners, a man who called us three 'Sawdl Y Fuwch' saying happily enough one time, that he, surely would be completely prepared to stay on for [something] further, if it weren't for his wife. This was a man who held a high-up and respectable job before he came in.
In prison he started to be given some chores here and there, to do in the place of some of the officers. His breast would fill with pride in completing these empty chores over so and so; had he a tail he would wag it in the dust of his captivity.
The generation that I belong to has been in prison for seven centuries. [Don't really understand next sentence]For the first time having lost her independence, the [something] of the English was a difficult enough thing to suffer under. But in the period of the Tudors, Wales started to get [something] and jobs in the government of the English. The contemptuous respect of the foreign become more of a thing in her eyes than proud respect towards herself. She didn't feel anything any longer of losing her freedom. Her obedient servility under every circumstance was considered as one of her chief qualities. She came to strive[?] in her captivity and to sing 'God Save Our Gracious King' and to wave the Union Jack more eagerly than the keenest English jingo. The end of the Welsh life - the language, the culture, the civilisation, the safety of its sacred places, and the misery and despair of Cwm Rhondda and Merthyr are nothing in her eyes. Was the king not in Caernarfon Castle, and Lloyd George translated a Welsh hymn to English for the occasion? Wales shook her tail until the dust of her wretchedness blinded her eyes. 'Sawdl y Fuwch' became a symbol of an old nation's life that was once proud and noble.

true,Dusty_Star,null,null,"Sorry my inital post was hasty

It would be a compare and contrast blog.

I am originally from Australia so I would be writing about the differences between the UK and Aus political systems and their policies.

The aim would be to show people that they do not have to put up with the way things here are, and to turn against apathy and towards action.

The Government agency in Aus is Centrelink. That agency does *everything* and is interlinked with *everything*.

A lot of my friends live off it.

They all live in privately rented accommodation, own and run a car, support a pet, enjoy regular nights out and have an iphone 5.

One of my friends is a musican. He lives off of Centrelink payments and gig money. He has just flown to the other side of the country to see the same concert twice. When he got home, he then booked to see the same concert *again* in a state slightly closer to home. 

He paid for 3 concert tickets, 2 sets of air fairs, and 2 sets of hotels.

He and all my other friends *constantly* complain about how hard off they are and how the country is falling apart.

I spend a large proportion of my time explaining to them how well off they actually are. 

I think it's time that someone explained to the people of the UK, how well off they could be.

I feel that people here are apathetic so I would detail these differences and help show people that they *do not* need to put up with the god almighty shit that is the British Government.

I was a laboratory technician in Aus but *any* job that brings me out better than on benefits would do. Sadly those jobs are scarce.

My situation has changed since my inital post.

Looks like I will be kicked off my benefits now.

I had 1 sickness on my record from Jan. I was told I had to attend a 2 day 'how to find a job' course. I went on the first day. It was snowing. The building was concrete with no heating. I froze my arse off and woke up sick the next day so didn't attend.

My voluntary work placement has apparently kicked me off and registered me as having several days off sick with the job centre. I had already approached the job centre about my issue with the bus and requested support to be told there was none.

So now apparently my sick days total 3 somehow, i'm only allowed 2. 

What my adviser told me on the phone didn't really make much sense but I have been doing my 13 steps a week and 6 jobs a fortnight and signing on.

&gt;I don't want more people taking drugs, I don't buy the argument that everybody who wants to take drugs will seek them out now, if they're legal then usage will increase. It's bad enough the amount of people walking around off their heads why would you want to make it worse?

You assume that usage would increase if we relaxed regulation. That may seem intuitive but as we've seen from Portugal and the Netherlands that isn't necessarily the case. Portugal decriminalised cannabis (and other drugs besides) and now they now have one of the lowest marijuana using rates in Europe. Excluding tourists the same can be said for the Netherlands. In fact both those countries have lower cannabis usage rates compared to the UK. 

&gt;We have a bad problem with mixing and binging in the UK that exceeds that of places like Holland and Portugal by a large margin. People will take legal drugs to excess and mix it with other substance abuse; considering most people drink spirits before they leave the house on a night out now, how does them adding weed to that mix benefit anyone including the police?

Oh come on. Have you ever smoked weed or been around someone who's smoked weed? If anything mixing alcohol with weed is going to make it easier to police. Not that I am saying smoking copious amount of weed and going out binge drinking is a healthy activity. 

&gt;There's no going back if it happens, you can't recriminalise something if it all goes wrong so why take the risk?

Why couldn't we go back? Honestly I doubt it would change much asides from tax revenue and the penal system. It's getting consumed in either case. 

&gt;We have enough problems with substance abuse, why on earth would I want to introduce more?

You wouldn't be. If anything moving away from a punitive system to one of treatment has proven successful in the reduction of substance abuse. 

&gt;You can already get out of your skull on drink, why do you need more? 

Well, personally I drink in moderation. 

&gt;There are well documented long term health negatives (which everybody likes to ignore), I don't want the nation's health to get worse.

Well, thanks mum, but the thing is it's less dangerous than tobacco and alcohol by most measures. Certainly less addictive. Besides, even if that were not the case it's still an issue of personal risk (and if there's a financial cost to society via health care costs then tax the hell out of it like we do alcohol). Speaking as an avid rock climber I don't want to live in an authoritarian country where we're prohibited stupid/dangerous things, especially if it's something we spend billions fruitlessly trying to stop.

They then tapped an extra £200 on top which was never mentioned in the T&amp;C's we were originally issued (thanks to evernote all corrospondance was kept right from the beggining!), nor the updated ones on their website.

They then went on to claim I would have been informed verbally (which I maintain I wasn't), so I asked them to pull up the recording of the phonecall where I was told.

After being passed on to the 5th separate department to explain my request/situation the line just went dead, so I call back and start again...

Eventually they admitted that they couldn't find the recording where they told me, so agree'd to waive the extra £200.

true,newpathstohelicon,scot-lanarkshire,Glesga,"&gt;I don't want more people taking drugs, I don't buy the argument that everybody who wants to take drugs will seek them out now, if they're legal then usage will increase. It's bad enough the amount of people walking around off their heads why would you want to make it worse?

Doesn't matter what you want, really. People are still going to take drugs. How many times have you been hassled by drunk people? That tends not to happen with stoned people. So if your argument is that more people will smoke weed, and this is a bad thing because any intoxicated person WILL cause trouble...well, it's bullshit. More people on weed = less 'trouble' for people like you.

&gt;We have a bad problem with mixing and binging in the UK that exceeds that of places like Holland and Portugal by a large margin. People will take legal drugs to excess and mix it with other substance abuse; considering most people drink spirits before they leave the house on a night out now, how does them adding weed to that mix benefit anyone including the police?

Again, never seen anyone get aggressive after smoking a joint. People already take drugs and mix them with alcohol, but here's the thing: most people who can get access to weed can also get access to harder drugs, via their dealer. Making weed legal takes away the dealer factor. People who want to buy cocaine will still, I imagine, find a way to buy cocaine. People who aren't that bothered won't have the temptation.

&gt;This entire thing is about protecting criminals and I hate it, the whole ""being caught with cannabis shouldn't ruin your life""; whether it should be illegal or not the person knew it was illegal when he/she decided to partake in it. They're not innocents at all.

Social attitudes change all the time, and laws change to reflect this. Gay sex was illegal in England and Wales until 1967, Scotland until 1980 and NI until 1982. You can argue that anyone prosecuted for it before it was legalised were knowingly breaking the law and therefore deserved punishment, but looking back, most people would acknowledge that the law was in the wrong here.

&gt;We have enough problems with substance abuse, why on earth would I want to introduce more?

Regulation of the trade and manufacture of drugs would surely only help with substance abuse. 

&gt;There's no going back if it happens, you can't recriminalise something if it all goes wrong so why take the risk?

...pretty sure you **can** recriminalise something, but even if you couldn't...what risk? The ACMD has been recommending drug law reform for years now, based on decades of research.

&gt;You can already get out of your skull on drink, why do you need more?

Human nature? Being stoned is nothing like being drunk. Far more pleasant, in my experience.

&gt;There are well documented long term health negatives (which everybody likes to ignore), I don't want the nation's health to get worse.

Are there? More so than alcohol or tobacco?

&gt;People who actually need the benefits of weed can get it legally as medicinal use.

This would also be good.
