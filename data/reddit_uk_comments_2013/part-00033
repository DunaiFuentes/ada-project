I find this to be one of those things that makes me think a *lot*. Even the scenes during the end credits changed my viewpoint on the characters slightly. 
The questions I am asking myself: of did she deserve it? Would she have deserved something similar if she had had intact memories? Are the presenter/actors bad people? Are the audience? How much can we trust the backstory? People get wrongly accused and prosecuted all the time. Am I sexist for wondering if he was controlling her to film it? Should I be wondering if she was controlling him?

And on a more shallow note: Was that intentionally resembling the popemobile? Have I ever seen a woman look that disheveled on TV before (this is a good thing)?

true,hybridtheorist,null,"Leeds, YORKSHIRE","&gt; I've never met many people on social housing who have a four bedroom house as a couple or even a two bedroom place for that matter because councils have always had a policy of putting people in places just about big enough for their needs

Yep, but once they're there, they're immovable. I imagine most people you know on/waiting for social housing are relatively young, with children still living with them. The issue arises when those children leave, and they still have ""the right"" to live in these homes with extra bedrooms.

My grandparents (who paid rent rather than got benefits, then utilised right to buy) used to have a three bedroom council house, that she moved into maybe 50 years ago.
They had 4 kids, so had a 3 bedroom house (for a married couple, a son and three daughters). Now there's just her. 

If she'd been on housing benefits the whole time, and was still living in a council house, it hardly seems fair that the government should pay for one person to live in a 3 bedroom house, just because at one point decades ago she *did* need a house that size. It was just the two of them for the last.... 30-35 years I'd guess. 

Meanwhile there's people more in need crying out for a council home (or a bigger one than they currently have). ",0,1361235409,null,0,false,0,c8hiuep,t3_18qroo,t1_c8hiuep,t1_c8h8l82,null,1431334361,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

People are hating on keto now apparently. Not sure why. For what it's worth, my breath smells fine and I'm not an awkward twat at a restaurant, because you don't have to stick to it every single day of your life. I eat whatever I want at a restaurant.

I agree that exercise is pushed too hard, when we should really be pushing dietary changes even further.

Colin is one of my favorite Doctors, I recently started listening to his Big Finish stuff.

I have recruited 30 people, to do that I have looked at over 500 CVs and covering letters.  One obvious mistake and you are on the reject pile. 
Covering letters are as important as the CV.  Very few do them, a few reference the role, very few say why they'd love the job. A good cover letter boosts an average CV. 
Tailored CV for every role.  If you are going to spend 40 hours a week doing a job spend 40 minutes making your CV fit what they are asking for. 
Key words - bollox to dynamic, entrepreneurial, etc recruiters CV search tools look for key words not fluff. Want to be a copy writer? Make sure ""copy writer"" is in your CV.  Remember you know your potential job better than the recruiter.  I posted a CV that didn't mention my industry sector, I was very technology specific.  I didn't show up in searches as recruiters used non industry terms while I used very specific terminology.
If you are going for a job, demonstrate the desired traits from the first contact.  If its telesales, don't email, call.

To be UK focused, I've had 2 productive meetings today, both in pubs.  Both about 6 figure salary roles. I don't have A levels or a degree.

For Elizabethan you have to go Stratford upon Avon obviously. Also, Hardwick Hall (you must have heard of Bess of Hardwick, richest woman in England after Elizabeth I), Hampton Court Palace (home of Henry VIII) and the Tower of London.

As for Scotland, go to the big towns and cities so Edinburgh, Glasgow (keep an eye out for Charles Rennie Mackintosh buildings like the School of Art), Aberdeen and St Andrews. Also, Balmoral, Stirling Castle (where Mary, Queen of Scots was crowned), Glen Coe and Ben Nevis and the Cairngorns.

But seriously don't limit yourself to just Medieval and Tudor history because you'll miss so much like Georgian Bath, Victorian Manchester, Edwardian Liverpool, Gothic Oxford.

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"I am of the belief that history did not teach us that technology does not destroy jobs; the lesson we were taught by history and the Luddite movement is that something being more efficient does not equate to needing less workers, but that was a lesson from a very different time period where the idea of 'machinery' was nowhere near as advanced as today.

What we are seeking in our modern economy is to put the bulk of the work on the 'machine' and limit human interaction to where it is needed. It's logistically an ideal goal as a machine is a one-off investment that runs itself versus a human which is a constant time to money cost. This is in many respects different to the early Industrial Revolution 'machinery' which were incredibly simplistic in many regards and still revolved around human workers.

That's not to say that I'm arguing technology does destroy jobs. On the contrary, I believe technology is limiting the avenues of specialisation for the workforce. We've been arguing for decades, if not centuries, that humans are flexible and adapt to situations and we are all unique. However, the global economy is starting to have less opportunities for those whose talents are squarely in 'physical creation' with metals and whatnot.

What I mean is; we are obsoleting certain talents by automating them and I'm really not sure if it is a problem or not. I wouldn't advocate deliberate inefficiency; if we don't improve efficiency we run the risk of eventually reaching a critical junction regarding global disease and famine due to manufacturing and output being incapable of meeting the population demands.

I'm not completely sure why I like The Sixth so much, I just find his stern, overdramatic personality to be very entertaining. Maybe it's partially  because I was rather unimpressed with The Fifth Doctor. 

Sil was a horrible character, I couldn't believe they brought him back for a second episode. Anyway, with only 2 short seasons, I felt a great deal of ""what if"" about The Sixth Doctor, which I why I felt the need to jump into the Big Finish audios before finishing the classic series (I still haven't seen all of One, Two, or Seven.)

My other favorites are Three, Four, Ten, and Eleven. Ten is the ""go-to"" for most people for good reason. It's tough to pick just one, but I'd say he's my favorite, though Smith might pass him by the time he retires.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I'm curious about how they're gonna handle the fact that The Doctor is half-human. The Master mentioned it in the movie and the movie's canon. I think I would've liked The Sixth Doctor more if he followed The Fourth Doctor. And I would've liked The Fifth Doctor more if he followed The Sixth Doctor. It would've made a lot more sense to me if the regenerations went Wacky Doctor, Crazy Doctor, Plain Doctor. Well, if I could choose, I'd make sure that The Fifth Doctor didn't exist. He was so boring. And he lost me completely early on when he played cricket. That was something I couldn't imagine *any* Doctor doing. It seems like such a posh sport and The Doctor is always varying shades of antiestablishment. Yeah, The Third Doctor was with U.N.I.T. for a while, but that's because he had to. And he never let Lethbridge-Stewart forget that he was anti-them. And he always took the first chance he got to escape. Of course, they always ended badly, but it's the thought that counts. One of my favorite Doctor moments was when he was finally able to use the TARDIS again and he ran off to a planet. Then came back to Earth swiftly because it was stormy and violent and he almost died. I wish more Doctors threw a punch. It's a shame that the dandy Doctor was the most violent.

I enjoy Eleven a lot because I see a lot of me in him. I see a lot of me in Ten, too. Three and Four are the ones I'd like to be. Four had two of my favorite Doctor moments. One involved him tripping a god-alien with his scarf with Sarah Jane and making it fall into a chasm. The other was on ""The Pirate Planet"". He needed a space car that was being guarded and lured the guard away with jelly babies. My favorite thing about it was the second time it happened with the same guard.

My other problem with the Trial is that I was still trying to adjust to The Sixth Doctor because The Fifth Doctor was so bland. It was like going from drinking water to drinking maple syrup. I watched every single episode over last Summer because I needed something to do while I was filming, so it was a series of Gallifreyan waves for four months.

Um, 95% passing accuracy **for a team** is insane, let alone a player, and is never going to happen. Right now our average passing accuracy is at 85.2%, according to WhoScored, with Arsenal leading the PL at 86.2%.

Also ""true wingers"" wouldn't help our goal scoring abilities. Natural wingers, or whatever you want to call them, are much more adept at providing width to spread out the defense and crossing, or cutting inside, from out wide. In BR's system the fullbacks provide the width, while the wingers usually drift towards the middle and shoot or interplay with the rest of the midfield.

They're getting the same amount of money they always got, only now they'll have to spend a portion of it on the council tax and the bedroom tax, as well as having to contribute to rent.

For someone on JSA in my area, these costs will be:

* bedroom tax (1 unused) = £11.20 pw
* council tax = £3.84 pw
* rent contribution = £12.50 pw
* total = £27.54 pw

Over 25s get £71 pw on JSA. After those expenses they would be left with £43.46 pw. Subtract £20 pw for electricity and another £20 pw for food and that leaves £3.46.

true,bainesworld,lfc87,,"Playing Henderson out wide? we've been down that road before, all last season when he was lousy.  I like Henderson a lot and always felt that given a chance in his preferred he'd be an asset, but he isn't a wide player.

But I agree about Downing.  He's getting a lot of praise for some good performances, but he hasn't been outstanding, he's simply been a solid Premiership player.  To challenge for top 4 next season and the league in the future we need better players than Downing and a solid wide attacking player isn't good enough.  As one of the more senior players on the pitch, for me he's also too quiet.  When did you ever see him give someone a bollocking? we need the senior players to keep performances good and to keep the younger players on their game (hence Carragher coming in for Skrtel).  His latest form should at least drive our asking price up and he'd fit in well at Stoke or West Ham and I think we should get rid in the summer and wish him luck.  

Having said that, I don't think Ince is necessarily the answer.  Would love to have him if he was prepared to be a sub for a while (but if he was, he wouldn't have left in the first place), but he remains an unproven player at the top level.  We've got a fuckload of promising youngsters, we need experience and presence in the starting XI.  I'd be happy to get Ince and send him out on a season loan to another Premiership team to let him get up to speed and then reassess the situation.

First priority up front for me is to replace Downing with someone better and as experienced, not someone who might turn out to be better.",0,1361257760,null,0,false,0,c8hpjcv,t3_18rrv5,t1_c8hpjcv,t1_c8hjsmq,null,1431337582,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

To give you some idea the cost of new infrastructure, the new Thames Gateway port is spendimg over 500 million on road rail and dredging alone with 200 million more up for discussion or planned. 

Say they construct the barrage with large enough locks for the present vessel sizes, within a decade or probably less the port would be excluded due to the pace of ship size increase.

Now you take this, that's an order, Doctor. You take the gun, you take the gun and save your life. And please don't die, you're the most wonderful man on earth! I don't want you to die! 

The emotion he showed...that little raspy sob caught in his throat as he said he's the most wonderful man...

The way I looked at it, he was an old man who had simple joys in life, and was satisfied with what was before him. His home, his family... but he always looked to the stars, always hoping, wishing, thinking  that there was more. Even if there never was anything he experienced, he still would.

But then the Doctor took his granddaughter for a companion, and he didn't shy away. He wasn't fearful or upset or angry. He was ecstatic that not only does his flesh and blood get to experience the universe, but that all of his stargazing was worth it. Aliens existed! The universe is much much bigger than just the Earth! How wonderful! The Doctor is involved in his life more and more as the series continues, but he was never directly involved in solving the problems the Doctor presented. One of the more memorable scenes with him was his attempt to fight back against the Daleks, but even then, he knew it was a long shot that his attempt would make any difference.

And then, suddenly and all at once, he not only meets all sorts of aliens and crazy alien technologies and events, but he's forced to participate in them and help the Doctor. The Doctor not only asked for his help, but he relied on it. It's not that he wouldn't volunteer, but more that it just hit him so suddenly. And he took it in stride, and jumped in where needed. He rationalized the information he got as best as he could with what little knowledge he had. But he did a damn good job with it - there's a reason why many people loved him.

Wilfred was us - our voice, how WE feel. That if something that was to happen as wonderful as being swept up in the Doctor Whoniverse, we'd all try to be like Wilfred. A little scared, a little brave, and so very human. But moreover, he knew that the Doctor was aware of his limitations (age, ignorance, etc.) but did the best with what he had.

I also think the clever element is just the vivid illustration of this alternative justice system. Imagine a convicted criminal in our media that is widely despised, say Ian Huntly for example. Rather than pop him in a warm cell away from the world with a tv and meals, there's a part of people who would want this man to re-live a hell every day for what he did and that members of the public can pay an active part in contributing to this persons daily living punishment. Extreme illustration of course, but haven't you ever thought that's maybe thats what people like Huntley,  Saville and other high profile killers/peados could do with?

Anyway I guess the point that you are trying to make is that you can't tax benefits because it's money the government 'gives' in the first place and is not earned? 

Well firstly that's simply not true benefits can count as taxable income and the only reason that tax is simply not worked out as a cut (the cheaper, simpler way of dealing with it) is that it's taxable based on a number of factors that may not be known at the time the money is paid out. If you are in social housing the government knows before paying out if you have more bedrooms than you think so instead of circulating the money in and out they simply don't pay it out. In this case a tax may not be technically correct but it's no where near wrong enough to have actually provoked this level of debate. Which I guess brings us to...

Secondly theirs a worrying moral implication you are making that people don't have a right to or ""own"" the money they get from benefits and that is frankly a framing of benefits that is often used as an excuse to make claimants look less moral than ""earners"" and imply that they haven't worked at hard at life. It stinks, along with your other reasoning, of the morality of wealth lie that the Americana Dream is based on that conservatives are trying so damn hard to import because it's so useful. Strive and you'll be fine so if you are not fine then you must not strive with makes you a scrounger that must be hated for not striving like all those rich people who earn their money in a vacuum and own nothing to the state and who the dirty scroungers must never question.

My Mum works in the education system, teaching remedial mathematics to teenagers who are either too thick or too belligerent to learn in a mainstream setting. 

She earns a pittance, like all TAs (plus she gets to deal with the snobbery of teachers who are happy enough to let her deal with kids they can't despite have teaching degrees, handle).

She couldn't afford to buy her own home, but on the other hand, the money she gets from her lodger means she *doesn't have to claim HB*.

Because unlike you, and so many other people in the UK, she doesn't think that benefits are an entitlement.

How my Mum came to lose the property she and my Dad came to live in is *none of your fucking business* but it was not her fault, and the end result is that she is out of a damaging and abusive relationship.

Her long term goal out of this is to move into a private, rented place, thus freeing up the house she now lives in for someone else that needs it, but for now, that's not an option.

She doesn't profit in any way - it's been a year and a half since I saw her. She couldn't afford to travel up for our wedding because every penny she gets goes towards paying off the debt my Dad ran up, and saving to move into a privately let place.

I send her money when I can, but she doesn't like taking money from my Sister and I. For Christmas, I bought her some bed linen, after I found out that she'd couldn't afford to replace some of the stuff she has, and was going to buy it from a charity shop.

Keep CVs as short as you can while maintaining crucial info.  Most employers do not care what you did ten years ago so keep it short and simple.  A friend of mine who ran a successful recruitment agency reckoned that anything over 2 sides of A4 was a waste of time.  

Last job first - always - and show you know what job you are applying for by tailoring your CV.  
If you are applying **direct** for a job do not fill you CV with what you think are keywords, techbabble or meeting bingo words.  Nothing is more irratating than reading dozens of CVs full of ""synergy"" ""dynamic leadership"" ""team player"" etc.  You are trying to sell yourself so reflect yourself in your CV.

I met people for a coffee and a chat to suss out the industry and what people are looking for.

I went to meetings with these people. I followed people on Twitter. I worked hard at honing my skills for my sector. I went to the offices of these people and sat with them and talked and listened.

I'd have him over Downing tbh. Brendan said he wants mature players etc. but Downing has showed he can be just as frail mentally as the younger players.

NHS sent me to private because I need urgent care when I have issues. They sent me to private only because it is faster.

I could tell you some sorties. Stories that would make the front page of the paper. I've even had an NHS nurse get me a lawyer because they wanted me to sue the NHS.

For the second half, whilst really enjoyed the rug being pulled out from under me, I unfortunately found the lead actors performance a bit too hysterical and over the top and by the end I just wanted her to stop shrieking so much.

I think some of the problems stem from the difficulty of setting up such an ambiguous character - She was never made too sympathetic in the first acts because the audience would have felt rightly betrayed once her awful crime is revealed.  We are then left with something of a cipher at the centre of the piece.

It did keep me thinking long after it had finished however, and as I was drifting off to sleep I had something of a realisation - The whole of the first two acts, she is being dragged through the story by others and generally showed very little of her own agency.  Whilst this is obviously crucial to forwarding the plot and dragging her up to the White Bear transmitter, I realised that it had a resonance beyond that.  As she is being played the TV clips of news footage, someone on camera says something like 'her defence claimed that she was manipulated by her malevolent boyfriend, but the judge found her to be complicit, calculating and evil' (or words to that effect).

true,SMTRodent,eng-nottinghamshire,Back in Nottnum,"Assuming your first day, Day Zero, is spent arriving, settling into your hotel room in London, changing money etc., I suggest the following rough itinerary, based on the comments in this thread and my own knowledge:

Day One: visit the Natural History Museum in London. 
Don't just look at the exhibits: look at the building itself. It is largely built with terracotta, and features many, many animal sculptures. Also, if there's a particular mammal, bird, insect or fish you want to know about, find the relevant section and ask a few thoughtful questions. You should end up with a very good answer from an enthusiastic expert, which is like getting your own personalised Ted talk.

Then lunch. I don't suggest eating at the museum café, as the food is uninspired and very expensive. Instead, either eat somewhere like the Ritz, so you can say you've done it, or research places to eat lunch in London that are on the route between the NHM and your next objective. Or find an area rich in cafés and pick one with an interesting menu. There's a Food Hygiene scheme with a green certificate, from 1 (not quite bad enough to be shut down, but still grubby) to 5 (absolutely clean and safe). Eat only in places displaying a '5' rating, which should be prominent.

Next, visit either the Tate for modern art, or the National Gallery for traditional art, or the Tower of London.

If you still have energy, then you can spend the evening at the theatre or a West End show. Time Out magazine is a good guide to what's worth seeing.

DON'T travel anywhere around London before 10am, or between 4pm and 7pm. You'll be shoved, pushed, crammed and possibly sworn at. On escalators, stand on the right (in single file) and walk on the left.

NB: throughout Britain, tea comes with milk, usually in a small jug. If you want lemon, you'll have to ask. Coffee also comes with milk as default, though some hotels and restaurants offer cream with coffee.

Day Two: Drive up to Buckinghamshire, where you are staying in a small Bed and Breakfast in a village. Aylesbury is the county town, but is *astonishingly* ugly. It is like all the ugliness in Buckinghamshire has been concentrated in this one town, leaving the surrounding area full of the most delightful thatched cottages imaginable. You can potter about the Chilterns, or visit Oxford, though you may find the latter disappointing as it is a nucleus of medieval buildings surrounded by swathes of all the worst that 1970s architecture and road-building have to offer. This is also your chance to visit some neolithic features, of which there are many - Uffington, Avesbury, the Rollrights and more.

Days Three and Four: 

Choice one: Nottingham. Quite a long drive for a Brit, but I am assuming here an American approach to driving. Nottingham has an absolutely *awful* 'five star' hotel on Maid Marian way which will give you a dreadful experience, and a very good hotel, the Park Inn on Mansfield Road, where there is a service-oriented staff culture. Or stay in the Holiday Inn for reliable comfort on a budget. 
In Nottingham there is the Castle (actually a stately home) and, huddled against the rock (and partly dug into it), are the Brewhouse Yard Museum, the Schoolhouse Museum and the Trip to Jerusalem pub with 1189 painted on it. There's also a Costume Museum, and The Park which is a residential area planned by Victorians and with some beautiful buildings. Also next to the Castle are a row of brick buildings by Fothergill Watson, which are fantasies built in redbrick. Basically, you can get a good swathe of history, from the Romans up to the 20th Century, in a very small space in one day, and for very little money.

I can be a guide for Nottingham if you arrive on the right day and give me enough notice.

Choice two: Stratford Upon Avon. Shakespeare, Shakespeare, Shakespeare and Shakespeare. I can't speak as to accommodation, but if you like Shakespeare then this is a must-see.

 For more scenery, when leaving drive up through Derbyshire so you can see the Peak District and the Pennines, though this will be a long drive. Hence adding an extra day.

Day Five: Liverpool. There's an Aquaduck tour which is illuminating. There's architecture galore (as throughout Britain if you look above the ground floor at buildings). There's the Beatles sights, and art galleries, and the British side of the history of slavery. There's also a current art and music scene you can get into. And there's whatever Liverpool has on at the moment, which can range from the sublime to the ridiculous.

Day Six: Cumbria. You'll end up driving through the Lake District, which is beautiful (stop at either Tebay services or Reggia to eat for real food), but it's oversaturated with tourists. Cumbria is beautiful and has a Real Food culture going on, so you can find the very best of British food up here and it'll be cheaper than staying by the Lakes.  

Days Seven to Ten: Scotland! Haggis Travels sounds well worth doing, and Edinburgh is a great place, especially if you visit the underground streets. The drive up is also very pretty. 

Days Eleven to Fourteen:

Choice One: Go back to London, get a Time Out magazine and advice from Tourist Information, and really explore the place before you go. London has a huge wealth of things to see and is well geared to tourists, although it is costly. Madame Tussaud's wax museum, whichever sights you missed above, Buckingham Palace and many more points of interest. Also, there are restaurants serving cuisine from literally every country on Earth, usually authentic, and fusion restaurants for new and interesting food experiences.

Choice Two: go to Northern Ireland. Place yourselves in the hands of tourist information, and eat, kick back and relax by the sea, or stay in Belfast and learn the history of the conflict between Eire, the UK and the factions of Northern Ireland.

Choice Three: go to Orkney. Take a ferry across to enjoy the ocean, and visit an astonishingly beautiful place with more history than you can shake a stick at. Rocks, tombs, museums, handmade jewellery and many other things, including the shortest scheduled flight in the world. Orkney is so remote, even most Brits haven't been there.",0,1361271263,null,0,false,0,c8hrb5b,t3_18rmvo,t1_c8hrb5b,t3_18rmvo,null,1431338430,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Small-scale possession of drugs for personal use would be decriminalised. The starting point would be advice to policing authorities to caution rather than prosecute for offences of drug possession for personal use and to refer offenders to the health-care services (see DU411). Subsequently, regulations would be brought forward removing criminal sanctions for simple possession of controlled drugs for personal use. The recommended sentences for small-scale supply would be non-custodial options. The possession of pipes made for the use in connection with smoking of opium would no longer be a criminal offence. A Royal Commission or similar body would be established to review currently controlled drug classifications, within a legalised environment of drug use.

true,Raffles_Dad,null,null,"I have a real problem with companies that do this, I have been through work programmes and volunteer a few hours a week to help people that have long term health problems and are unemployed.  

Everyone I deal with has been written off by these schemes and the jobcentre (they are in the “fast track” signing on system) but with more time and support many of these people do get into employment, not well paid or full time but sufficient for them to get away from most of the benefits system and having to deal with people that have no idea of what it is like to face disability and unemployment as they have never been through it. 

The pop psychology approach of many of these schemes fall flat with people with long term health conditions as many of them are professional patents and have a greater knowledge than those that are seeking to teach them, an example of this was a ‘motivational’ session ran by a national provider that was very obviously written by someone with some knowledge of CBT but those that provided the training failed to answer the very well thought out questions of people that had received CBT and other talking therapies for years as they lacked the knowledge. 

If job providers abide by the equalities act and give people a far go they find that many people that are considered to be unemployable are in fact very employable and in many cases damn good employees.   Yep you will still have issues but nothing that cannot be overcome, but the people that are making the decisions just do not get the reality of the situation, yes people with long term health problems need more support to get into employment but the employers also need to abide by the law as the present situation is one of discrimination, if you do not believe me go pick any advertised job and ask for an application pack. If it comes with a health monitoring form ask yourself if you would get an interview if you had to put a long term disability on that form? If you doubt it would have an affect fill out the application and the disability form (and make it a mental health issue – long term anxiety and depression is the most common mental health problem in the UK) and see if you ever get an interview.

Also the issue is the roles that people with disabilities are offered, I have seen very highly qualified people that have been out of work for some time due to illness been offered entry level posts and then, despite being considered outstanding by the employer never progression beyond that role. A good example of this was a GP I met a few years ago that developed a mental health condition and decided that he would not return to the medical profession, this gentleman got himself a sales role in an associated field and his medical training combined with an outstanding work ethic made a real difference to the sales of that company, he shared his knowledge with co-workers and over a few years the company  grew to the point that is became a highly successful firm, however the ex-GP whom had contributed so much to this growth was still in the same post whilst the co-workers that he had supported had all gained promotions but still came back to him with questions whenever they had a problem. This is just one example of something that I have seen again and again. 

We do have some great people working in this area but the problem is when dealing with people that have long term health problems is that employers do not want to employ them, discrimination is almost universal, the law on equalities is ignored, those with long term problems need support from people that know what they are talking about not people that have never lived that life and they do not need to be stigmatise any more by the wider society. 

Sorry this became a rant but I’m very good at getting people into work and it is just getting harder, not because of lack of jobs but because the government and social attitude towards people with disabilities (partially mental health disabilities that face upwards of 80 % unemployment) is so far removed from the reality within the UK that the barriers are getting higher and the right helping hand is impossible to find.  

I know this is not an easy fix but not everything in life should be easy, we should look for and overcome challenges.

So they're basically privatising the benefits system through the back door.

This isn't about helping the unemployed, it's about profiteering.

So while we're all arguing over this because they're taking more and more money from the working man leading to us demonising the poor because they're seemingly getting stuff for ""free"" whilst we're working harder and harder for less money. They're all profiteering from it. 

They've succeeded in turning the public against itself. Classic divide and conquer whilst they run their own agenda high above the dust that's being kicked up. 

And, as you can read time and time again in these very comment threads and places like the BBC have your say, the Guardian, The Telegraph, the Daily Mail etc. and how the rhetoric tide has been turned,  it's damn well working.

true,EJR94,eng-kent,Kent,"Everybody seems to be for it here, but I see it being a similar situation to alcohol. Poorer people will waste what little income they have on it. Addiction isn't the problem, some will continue to buy it instead of more necessary needs. 

What's about people smoking around children? Do you want stoned children running around? People drink and smoke around children so why would they make an exception?

The problem isn't cannabis itself, I know that alcohol is worse but should we not stop allowing vulnerable people (mindless idiots who don't have self control) ruin their lives (and no doubt families lives)? Do many of you realise that it won't be college and University students who buy the majority of it? It'll be the people who are Jeremy Kyle contestants.


So, I anticipate you'd say ""dont let people on benefits or council housing buy it"". Well, my argument to that is segregating society could have adverse effects. I wouldnt be happy if I had less rights than someone due to my income. Infact many people could riot over this. More likely though, drug dealers could continue to opperate by selling to those who can't buy it. We're really not solving the problem. Sure it'll be harder for them but money will still go into criminal hands.

So, would society be better as a whole without legalised cannabis? Yes. Would it be better without alcohol? Yes. Would life become more boring? Yeah. It's never going to be a popular opinion but these comments were far too one-sided.

Your argument seems quite contradictory to me.  

On one hand you are saying the likes of myself shouldn't be allowed to buy clean government sanctioned cannabis to protect ""vulnerable people"" who will go crazy spending their money on the stuff.  Yet on the other hand you're saying we cant restrict those people for fear of segregating society?  

Are you not segregating society by not allowing it to be legalised in the first place while you try to protect these vulnerable people?

As for money going to criminals - that is completely untrue in my opinion.  Whether cannabis is legal or not, I will buy it and I will smoke it.

true,mattttb,eng-hampshire,Daaaaahhhn Saaahfff,"There has been a lot of research investigating the link between cannabis use and mental illness (specifically schizophrenia and other psychoses), and some of it has been conflicting.

Research by [Rey, (2002)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1124674/) supported the view that there is a link between cannabis and mental illness, and after reviewing the available literature at the time, concluded:
&gt;*Although the number of studies is small, these findings strengthen the argument that use of cannabis increases the risk of schizophrenia and depression, and they provide little support for the belief that the association between marijuana use and mental health problems is largely due to self medication.*

Similarly, research by [Kalant, (2004)](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2004-20355-010) reviewed research in this area and concluded:

&gt;*...there is no suitable evidence yet available to permit a decision as to whether long-lasting or permanent functional losses can result from chronic heavy use in adults. However, a small but growing body of evidence indicates subtle but apparently permanent effects on memory, information processing, and executive functions, in the offspring of women who used cannabis during pregnancy. In total, the evidence indicates that regular heavy use of cannabis carries significant risks for the individual user and for the health care system.*

Although some more recent research has provided a conflicting argument. [Frisher *et al.*, (2009)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/19560900/), investigated whether the increased use of cannabis use in the UK population over the last few years has led to an increased rate of the diagnosis of psychotic illnesses. They found no increase in the reported instances of psychotic illnesses despite the more widespread use of cannabis in the UK. Whilst this may seem to be conclusive in favour of the view that there is no link, this research only demonstrated that an increase in the population of cannabis users did not lead to an increase in those with a psychotic illness. This research didn't investigate individual cases, and it didn't study the effects of cannabis on its users. It is possible that although there are more users now, that serious or heavy use has not increased - and so this has led to a stable rate of the diagnosis of psychotic illnesses.

It's clear that there is no definitive answer to the question ""Is there a link between cannabis use and mental illness?"", but lots of research has demonstrated adverse effects besides mental illness. It is still a drug, drug use is *not* good for you.

true,AverageGeezer,irish,Essex Dubliner,"I can only agree to disagree.

As someone who was a long-term benefits claimer I can vouch at how easy it is to stay on benefits rather than seeking employment.  Is it hard to find a job at times? Yes. Should the fact you are on benefits deem you as a lesser human being i.e. told what you can and cant spend your money on? That's the key question.

We cant stop people from being idiots - If I go and spend all my money on heroin that is my choice and it is irrelevant what everyone else thinks of my decision as its my money that I worked to earn.

If you are on benefits - it is not your money, it is a hand-out from the people who are working trying to keep you in a livable lifestyle.  It's charity.  If you told me the money I donate monthly to children#s and foreign charities was being spent on kebabs and alcohol I would retract my donation immediately - I see JSA as the same, I donate my money to house, clothe and feed those who are out of work.  I don't agree with them spending said money on drugs/alcohol and anything other than what is necessary to live.  If you want the benefits of spending money, go and earn it then you have the freedom to do what you want.

I am personally all for restricting what certain benefits can be spent on.  I know from my past experiences that would have made me question why I was on benefits a lot sooner than I did.  The system is far too open to enable lazy people to live relatively comfortably whilst they do nothing for themselves or anyone else.

Whatever the decision on that I refer to my previous point, we cant stop people from being idiots.  To punish the greater mass to help these idiots is illogical.

The previous Labour Government declassified Cannabis to a Class C drug, but the papers went ape shit, saying those in charge are ""Soft on crime"" and started printing stories about individuals who's lives have been destroyed by cannabis (usually due anything but that obviously). So they reclassified it to a class B on the basis of ""new Skunk strains"" being more common because it was easier than trying to defend the decision. All bullshit.

The same thing happens whenever a new drug comes on the market (such as methadrone). One of the papers will run a story about someone dying because of taking a new drug, usually when they went a massive bender and took everything under the sun. Then again ""Soft on crime - allowing our children to die"" bullshit. The most ridiculous thing about it is of course that the new drugs are brought out because MDMA is a class A drug. They fail to spot the irony in their campaign.

David Cameron had indicated he was a moderate before he became leader of the opposition, then the press started accusing him of taking coke at Oxford and demanding he present his stance on drugs. This sort of thing makes it impossible for a politician of any power to take a moderate position.

If they legalize all drugs and spend the millions of pounds wasted on policing, court rooms and prisons into actually helping drug addicts come off the drugs then I'm positive general petty crime related to funding personal drug use would drastically drop.   

They could run a similar program like Portugal, where they offer the drugs for free if you use them in control environments and take counselling. Do you actually believe people want to be hooked on heroin? Stealing pipes for their next hit? Never eating? Living on the streets?

&gt;These days she is a mother-to-be, and draped in another set of threadbare attributions. Once she gets over being sick, the press will find that she is radiant. They will find that this young woman’s life until now was nothing, her only point and purpose being to give birth.

She then goes on to compare the way we treated former princesses\queens through history, comparing Kate to Marie Antoinette and how she was obsessed by appearance and more importantly how the public was obsessed by her appearance. 

Other points she raises is how Kate Middleton appears to be almost without a personality  

&gt; without quirks, without oddities, without the risk of the emergence of character. 

While on the surface this seems pretty scathing it is more to do with the fact how different she appears to Diana who was 

&gt;Diana whose human awkwardness and emotional incontinence showed in her every gesture. Diana was capable of transforming herself from galumphing schoolgirl to ice queen, from wraith to Amazon.


The most scathing attacks are for the press with my particular favourite being:


&gt;When her pregnancy became public she had been visiting her old school, and had picked up a hockey stick and run a few paces for the camera. BBC News devoted a discussion to whether a pregnant woman could safely put on a turn of speed while wearing high heels. It is sad to think that intelligent people could devote themselves to this topic with earnest furrowings of the brow,

Not entirely, I said that there was conflict of opinion, but that some research methodologies can't be used for direct comparisons with previous research. 

&gt;This is a ridiculous generalization depending on your definition of a drug you ""use"" thousands of drugs everyday, many of which are good for you many of which are not. Drug MISUSE is not good for you. The effects of drug use vary hugely

I said drug use is not ""good for you"", I did not say that all drug use it incredibly ""bad for you"". I think you'd find it hard arguing that cannabis/tobacco/alcohol use is beneficial to a person.

true,marquis_of_chaos,null,null,"So you have to ask why. To me this is a twofold answer. Firstly there is the fact that actually getting a property is so difficult (not enough housing to begin with and many is the wrong type needed for the demographics of the area.), and getting a property in a half decent area even more so. Once people have a decent property they are much less inclined to want to risk moving and be worse off, especially with the newer rules regarding which properties you can now be offered. 

For example, if you are a single person who rented a few years ago you could have been offered a two bedroomed house with a garden etc., now you would only be offered a single bedroomed property. Most of these types of property Tend to be filled with transient/social problem causers or pensioners and the disabled. You can guess which types of neighbours anybody who is not in a reserved age/disabled band will get. 

To me this is saying that you can be a law abiding, honest, citizen who has done nothing wrong but because the government has decided to cut what meager allowance you were previously given you will now have to move from your home and go live in a single person/smaller property on a stabby estate. Hardly fair is it.

The second problem is one of management at a local level. This again is twofold. Firstly the fact that there has been a lack of capacity in the social housing market for many years needs to be addressed. More social housing means less money from government being passed to the private sector and more being retained within the public sector, thus more money to be spent on local goods and services. 

Secondly there needs to be a overhaul of the current housing stock, both private and public. Unoccupied and unused private dwellings could easily be bought up, renovated, and brought into the social housing stock. There also needs to be action on rents in the private sector. Sadly, with the current boom in buy to let and the hosing bubble little is going to be done about house prices when many still see their future financial stability as being the ability to sell their overpriced house at a good profit.

TL:DR Right to buy decimated local housing stock and the slack was taken up by the private sector who charged accordingly. Lack of investment by the government in replacing lost housing capacity combined with councils under investing in the properties they had left (those properties nobody would buy in a million years) and a changing demographic over the years has lead to housing crisis that can only be solved by building more housing, not shifting social housing tenets around like pieces on a board game.",0,1361283882,null,0,false,0,c8ht2dw,t3_18qroo,t1_c8ht2dw,t1_c8hr3j4,null,1431339319,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It is normal to aspire, and want better, everyone does it. But at some point in life, 99% of people need to grow up and think, you know what? My dream of being a red arrows pilot is not going to happen. I need a job.

Don't aim low. Aim REALISTIC.

&gt;People like you, man. People like you make me sick to my fucking stomach. If we lived by your standards, we'd all still be living in the stone age.  

You. If we were all to think like you, where would we be? An army of unemployed physicists, thinking they are too good to flip burgers, or clean toilets, or stand on a production line, or pull a pint. All jobs I have done on my way up. Yes UP. I have never said be happy with what you have, but you need to be realistic. Wait for a gap in the market. Look for your path. Paths don't just open when you are ready. You don't leave university as look up to the sky and shout ""I'm here world! Please give me my job that I am entitled to! NOW!"" That's some sick fucking entitlement you have there, dude.

&gt;Show me one successful person on planet earth who ever ascribed to your ideology.

You're gonna hate me even more now. Me. I feel like a semi interesting life story is needed, seeing as you decided to bring up my 'abused childhood'. I consider myself a fucking successful human. You know what? I'm not usually big headed in reality, if you had meet me in civvies, you would probably come away from the meeting saying, ""Hey! That guy was a average, pretty nice, but ultimately forgettable human being!"", but when using my horrible, horrible internet persona, I get to sound like a egotistical prick, when I am in that uniform, men want to be me, and quite a lot of women want to fuck me. But they can't, because I'm married.

Why? I'm a fireman motherfucker. My job involves saving peoples lives, and it's as fun as anything. Ever. 2013 is a relatively slow year thus far. Saved 4 people so far. If heaven exists, I am bound to have a personal invite from Jesus. It wasn't even my dream job. I never even wanted to do this as a kid. I never even considered it as an option. Left school after not really trying. Cs in everything. Except IT. A D in that. I was not pleased. I went from school to college, deciding that computers would be my future, because in the late 90's COMPUTERS ARE THE FUTURE! Or present, depending on how you look at it. College was shit. Some bullshit advanced GNVQ in IT or something. 2 years of boredom. Worth it? Well, I learned a lot. Mainly that being a shy, quiet guy in a college full of loud cuntbags is not attractive to women, they preffered the cuntbags, but that is by the by at this juncture.

I was 18, I bounced from job to job. Never really happy. I, like you and your Disney fantasy thought I could be anything I wanted to be. I joined a football team. Surely it would not be long before Derby County called, and my dreams would come true?

It turns out that I am shit at football. Not just bad, but shit. My presence actively caused teams to lose. At the time, it felt like depression, I now realise, it was merely me being a little sad rather than depressed. I worked in a bar. I taught sports to disabled kids, I cleaned, I worked in a shop, I typed for days in an office, nothing was fun or right, but what else could I do? I'm no hyper intelligent nuclear physicyst like the great Silversuns, I was stuck in low skilled jobs, slowly working my way up the wage ladder. I became content. I lived with doing okay, simple jobs. Knowing that if a better opportunity came up, then I would take it. My exerience in many jobs, doing various shitty things, looks far better to a prospective employer than some entitled snob straight out of uni, expecting great employment, and not knowing how the working world works.

Eventually I saw a ""Help wanted"" sign in a window. My window of opportunity. I walked into the place of business and said, Yeah, I'll do that shit, it seems fun. And it was.

You see, that place of business was a Fire Station. I selected my aspirations according the job market. I did not say ""I want to be a dinosaur keeper"", because the amount of dinosaur keepers required is low. It's not hard you know! What are you anyway? In all your post of ""wawawawawawawa you suck, you suck, i am entitled, etc"" I never truly found out what your dreams are. I don't really care. Well done in getting there, if you did. Well done on picking your job based on job availablility. You used brains. Something you obviously posess. Even though the very idea of doing that is idiotic and false to you.

On the other hand, when mortgages are closer to 100% of the value of the house (at the point of purchase) then the market only has to drop by a few percent and the owners (and bank) have negative equity.  At present the low interest rates mean that those people who are mortgaged to the hilt can still afford to meet the monthly payments.  So there's no need for the bank to foreclose on anyone.... yet.

That's a false comparison though, isn't it. You can't compare the number of alcoholics who steal to buy booze to the number of people who drink alcohol. Because there is a big difference between someone who drinks regularly and an alcoholic.

One can drink regularly and not be addicted to it. One can smoke pot regularly and not be addicted to it. But if you do heroin or coke or meth frequently, you are *very probably* addicted.

So to make a fairer comparison, you'd have to compare the amount of alcoholics who steal to the amount of *alcoholics* who don't. And that's going to be a much higher percentage. If you go to any AA meeting I bet nearly every person there can tell you of some time they raided their wife's purse to buy drink, or stole from their kid, or work, or whatever.

My friend who suffered from psychosis was always a bit different, he was very inward looking, a fantastic artist, musically talented and in 2nd year in high school he was doing the work of 4th years. His brain was wired differently. Cannabis exasperated a condition he had underlying when he was using heavily (he used ecstasy, cocaine and various other substances alongside it which couldn't have helped.) He smokes cannabis again but only sparingly and he is fine now. 

Cannabis could be better regulated if it were legal as people who know nothing of it do not know of the two breeds. Sativa and Indica. Sativa has a very high THC content and low CBD content whilst Indica is the flipside and has a high CBD content and a lower THC content. THC is the chemical which can bring mental illness to the surface but the chemical that counteracts this is CBD. CBD is an incredibly effective natural anti-psychotic chemical and when perfectly balanced with THC you will experience no ill effects such as paranoia or mental illness.

Lets take the Pistorius case and compare it with White Bear;

We have a protagonist / antagonist - Victoria or Oscar.
We also have a background, in this instance both are murder.
I see the press being symbolised by Michael Smiley and the hunters, they build the story and shape it in a way that causes the most stir with the audience.

In this case I think it is unprofessional, the pill is a drug with potential side effects so parents should be involved in the decision while the child isn't old enough to be responsible for their own medical choices (I'm not sure exactly what the age of majority for medical decisions is). I support the provision of condoms and sex education, handing out the pill is not the same thing, school nurses should not be handing out any non-trivial drug without parental permission.

Parents should be involved with their children's sexual choices, it's unfortunate that the prevailing view is artificially based on the loud brayings of the Christian minority. The Dutch way of letting teenagers have their girlfriend or boyfriend stay over and have sex at home in a safe place with access to contraception is far better for everyone. Sex is great but must be treated with great care for the serious health, life and emotional consequences it can entail. Teenagers are sometimes (not all are ready at that age and should absolutely not be pressured in either direction) sexual beings and must be allowed to experience that as safely as possible.

And yet everybody would agree that it's fair that everybody is allowed to hold an opinion on anything.

As it stands I do actually know quite a bit more about the effects of drugs than the average person might do, (though not through personal use). I've done some research recently when thinking about this topic, and I've read some peer-reviewed journal articles about the effects of cannabis. When I said I haven't done a lot of research in this area I was referring to the fact that I haven't read every piece of evidence for and against the legalisation of cannabis, I wasn't actually saying ""I know fuck all about this, but here's my stupid opinion"".

My original comment was more a discussion on the way that people disregard the views of others on this website as ""ignorant"", even if they've done the same amount of research on the topic, just because they disagree with somebody. Also I'm getting tired of all the posts about the legalisation of marijuana making it to the front page. I don't mean this as a personal insult to anybody, but whenever I see links posted about marijuana on the front page I imagine the poster to be some 14 year old with the username ""420_blaze_it_fagget"" trying to prove how cool he is.

Hopefully the return of Mikel and Moses will help but even our best this season hasn't been good enough consistently. The only silver lining of this season would be 3rd (or better), possibly an FA/Europa Cup run and moving for a new manager as early as possible. It's not a season to be signing players in August, with no tournament this Summer we should move early and give the maximum time to gel

The striking department is poor and thin, the trio behind are too easy to read and plan for, we still only have one decent winger so cannot play the 4-3-3 effectively (without Hazard or Mata being too far wide), midfield is the weakest department with no physicality or creativity and an inability to control a game. To be perfectly honest I see our future best served in a 4-3-3 since I think playing Hazard and Mata slightly out of position is the lesser of two evils, the other being the continued domination of our midfield by proper opposition

Also you have the problem that the amount of people diagnosed with a mental illness =/= the number of people with mental illness. There are fashions (trust me) in the way that psychiatrists will diagnose mental illness, so that one year there will be more diagnoses of one mental illness, the next year another, even though the population of people with any particular mental illness hasn't changed at all. Also a change in culture, or the prevalence of certain illnesses affects the rate at which people are diagnosed with something.

UK Drug Policy Commission just finished a 6 year study that calls for decriminalisation

http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/dec/10/david-cameron-legalising-drugs

The government is simply refusing to listen... use indicators are being used to show policy is ""working"" but that's based on the assumption that use is inherently damaging and *needs* to be reduced in the first place. But you can understand why the party in power, especially a conservative one, wouldn't want to touch the issue given that it's so emotive. Presenting them with the evidence is useless because even if they agree (and honestly they most likely *do* privately, they are not half as stupid as they look) their base is one that most likely does not and if they want to get re-elected their interests aren't in what the population as a whole thing but in what the people who vote for them think.

We not going to actually see this change until a liberal party in charge who's base in mostly in favour of this and we need a the demographics to shift us more towards a population made up of people who have grown up in a world of increasing acceptance of drug use. 

But we need to keep having people raise this issue so that the public debate can carry on because it's one that will be won in the long run. Even more so if the USA progresses along it's current path. ",0,1361290202,null,0,false,0,c8huo3b,t3_18t8bl,t1_c8huo3b,t1_c8hrasc,null,1431340069,19,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,19

I've been saying that Falcao and Felliani should be our main targets from day 1,I'll proceed on the assumption someone gets the job done

I would play a midfield of Luiz, Fellaini and Oscar as the most advanced of the trio in midfield against weaker teams. Luiz and Fellaini can break up play, pass the ball a short to medium range and are strong enough to hold on to it with Oscar having more freedom to do his thing and pick the killer pass. Against stronger opposition I'd go with Ramires over Oscar for the added defensive cover and his pace on the counter. The attacking trio would ideally be Falcao supported by Hazard and Mata rotating with Moses and a new winger. These players have the flexibility to play in a few positions so could switch with Oscar etc. With more presence in midfield we could also allow more overlapping runs from the LB and RB position helping to make up for the lack of natural width

You may say my first formation is extremely similar to what we have now but the subtle difference is the initial position of the central AM and the moving of our fulcrum slightly further back the pitch.

The only reason to not try direct democracy is that the cabinet would lose control; and given that most are self-made millionaires already, and that they're not in it for the money, the only thing they can't afford to lose, is the power.

A direct democracy system may be tough. Many policies are best left to experts such as should we buy another tank or another helicopter, leave it to the public we'll have an army of kittens on the front line, and of course everyone wants more pay for fewer hours and lower tax which we can assume generally isn't feasible. But then maybe an educated public would be able to make certain decisions, maybe we're more intelligent than we're given credit for. I certainly don't remember there being an IQ test to enter the house of commons, and as for the lords, entry requirements seem to be financially based rather than knowledge and ability.

Certain things we rely on which is all too often taken for granted like the NHS, Fire and Police service right down to bin collections, but these are all important services based on making life in the UK better. We need someone competent to keep these things running ~~(because we sure as hell don't have one now)~~

I do also feel that ""people's views"" seem to hold very little weight in politics. Decisions come from the top, never from the bottom.

But government control is increasing and they have (and use) the power to increase control further. I understand having decisions of war and hospital staff numbers taken away from us but we're also having certain choices which are less important taken away. Our freedom to choose is being whittled away. I have a right to smoke, I was given all the facts and made the intelligent decision to stop. I took control of my own life. Other people decide to continue to smoke and thanks to the NHS there is a great support network for people who want to stop and are finding it difficult. I have a right to drink, I'm given all the facts and I exercise that right as often as possible. Smokers and drinkers pay extra of tax to help fund any care this may lead to (although dying sooner means they save on pensions) but the point is, I have the choice. 

But my personal freedom to choose to put any chemical or food into my body is being slowly taken away unfairly.

Well because we were discussing the idea that stealing to fund drug addiction disappears as an issue once a drug is legalised. Following on from this parent comment:

&gt;You forgot the line that 'drug users steal to fund their addictions'.

&gt;...which of course disappears as an issue when you sell it through regulated channels.

And Heroin and crack and the harder drugs are good ones to talk about since heroin users are probably the most likely to steal to fund their habit. It's no use discussing caffeine and tobacco if the subject is stealing to support your addiction.

We are just having a discussion about drug legalisation, it's nothing personal.

anyway, as to your point-

It is already perfectly legal to seek help for drug addiction, and the problems associated with it. So your argument that the fact it is illegal means people will be arrested if they seek help just doesn't add up.

I agree that 'help and support' for people who are stealing to fund their drug addictions may help to curb that behaviour, but I don't see what that has got to do with legalisation.

Social commentary of this show blows my mind.  Every episode.  Though I think this one hit home pretty well.

A few thoughts: 

1. It is talking about justice.  We, the audience, had compassion for her (though, for me, it waned dramatically because her her whining and ineptitude) and wanted her to reach safety and find her daughter.  We saw the onlookers as heartless and apathetic and the hunters as amoral monsters.  When act 3 came along, she became the amoral monster, the hunters became harmless actors and the onlookers remained heartless, but lost their apathy.  This switch in perspective was profound and brought up a lot of questions.  Specifically, is it wise to develop an opinion of a person with limited information? Should we trust with no reason to trust.  We literally knew nothing about her and we trusted that she was an innocent victim. Ultimately the question is, should we believe things without evidence?

2. This is obviously talking about the slippery slope of so-called ""Reality TV"" and the human desire to see justice served. There is a subreddit called /r/JusticePorn which I will admit to enjoying. It deals with people getting what we think that they deserve. It allows us to sit in judgment and condemn, with little info.  A common scenario is an armed store robbery which is filmed by the store cameras and winds up with the robber being shot by a customer, police or the clerk. One feels justified in taking pleasure in the robber's demise because the robber was committing an evil act.  We seem to crave this sort of justice porn when we see the perpetrator get instant punishment and their is no doubt about guilt. We rarely consider the series of events that lead the perpetrator to commit the crime, what societal pressures may have been brought to bear, and if the perpetrator might have been rehabilitated and become a fully contributing member of society with a valuable knowledge of how to change from criminal to agent of positive change.

3. Finally, was this truly justice? My biggest problem was the memory wipe.  If she'd been allowed to fully remember her crime and previous life, then I could almost say that it was justice.  But would wiping her memory not create a new and innocent person? If a person has no recollection of the event, should they be held responsible for it? Isn't the point of punishment to right a wrong? How is it righting a wrong if the wrong never happened in the perpetrator's mind?   I would argue that she was an innocent and that they were torturing an innocent, over and over again.  At which point does this become more monstrous than the original crime? Even if she did remember, one could ask the same question.",0,1361293538,null,0,1361294002,0,c8hvr7z,t3_18s306,t1_c8hvr7z,t3_18s306,null,1431340581,9,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,9

But the decade before that not only did they remain neutral in the World war 2 but the IRA were bombing major cities during the war. When Winston Churchill asked the Irish to open their ports to the allies the Irish told them to fuck off. This pissed off Churchill who retorted with ""We could just invade and take them for ourselves"" to which the Irish PM cleverly responded ""But arent you supposed to be the good guys?"". 

In truth the Irish favoured downed allied pilots by helping them and leaving the germans to die however I can understand the anti irish sentiment in England in the 50s with pub owners seeing not only did they remain neutral during WW2 but they were responsible for a ton of bombings across UK cities during the war.

Not all teenage girls live in a typical family unit. Sex was always something I spoke to my mum about, but never my dad (he would have literally locked me in my room alone for ever), what do the girls who only have fathers do? What if they feel uncomfortable talking to him? They don't want a baby, but the boyfriend doesn't want to use a condom. We, as adults would know this was wrong, and that he couldn't be much of a boyfriend, but the girl might not (though she'd learn by mistakes later in life no doubt). What would happen to her? Another pregnant statistic entering the system. 

And that's not all, many girls, for whatever reason feel like they simply cannot talk to parents about sex. That is what NEEDS to change but i'm afraid it won't any time soon. 
Instead of talking to parents they would most likely just risk it.

I'm also of the mind that by the time a girl reaches the age of 13/14 they are mature enough to make decisions about wether or not to go on the pill. The fact they are even capable of creating babies (by having periods) shows that evolution deems a 13 year old mature enough to raise a child, (it's modern day society, lack of job etc that makes them incapable) so how can they not be mature enough to decide wether or not to go on the pill?!

In other words being too heavy-handed can actually ruin the point your trying to make rather than make it more biting. 1984, Brave New World and the film Brazil work well in this respect, they're scathing without feeling forced.

Another thing that I sometimes disagreed with Brookers writing was I felt he misdirected his ire sometimes. I did sometimes find some of his topics unimportant, just ephermera about modern culture. This is of course entirely subjective though, it's down to personal opinion what you consider important.

Never the less these aren't complaints I had about White Bear, I felt although it was heavy, highly satirical and dark it really suited the subject matter and worked well. Also the topic he was covering was a very weighty one and does link in to the idea that technology can be damaging socially and is showing effects even now.

true,MarcusOrlyius,null,null,"&gt;I don't take meds apart from painkillers occasionally - would you like to explain why you've got such an issue with people that do, that you feel it's an insult?

I don't have a problem with people taking meds. The fact that you come out with such nonsense shows how illogical and delusional you are. When people who should be on meds stop taking them, it can lead to them doing and saying all kinds of crazy shit, which is why they're on medication in the first place.

&gt;And you're the one telling me that everything sounds like a quote from the DM? How do you know what the DM says unless you read it? You must read it seeing as how you're clearly so well versed with what it says.

Where did I say I've never read the Daily Mail? I've read it plenty of times and know exactly what type of crap it contains. I've never bought it though and I use adblock, so they don't get a penny from me.

&gt;Wow, you've got some real damage going on here. You hate people who have a different opinion to you, you've got issues against people taking medication and you think that it's cool to bandy about misogynistic insults.

Where have I said I hate anyone? Yes, I think a lot of people are delusional, I don't hate them though. I certainly don't have any issues with people taking medication and I haven't been throwing around any misogynistic insults. Calling you, and you alone, a slapper to make a point is not misogyny. Misogyny would be calling all women slappers.

&gt;And I'm right wing? What on earth does that make you?

Well, I advocate direct democracy over the Internet, followed by socialism (worker control of the means of production), following by communism (stateless and classless society) when the technology (something like Star Trek replicators) makes it possible.

I'll let you decide what I am.

&gt;Why? They can't afford it, so why should we support it? Especially when there are people who work who can't? Long term benefits should not be an option for anyone unless they're so crippled or mentally feeble they can't work.

Why? Because I'm not a selfish, delusional cunt. That's why. These are problems created by capitalism; by capitalists having a monopoly on the means of production and paying employees a fraction of what they actually deserve. This problem will continue to get worse as automation increases and developing nations become more developed. Unemployment is going to rise massively over the next few decades.

What do you think would happen if welfare did not exist? You think welfare is for the benefit of the poor? It's for the benefit of capitalists to stop the poor from rising up and revolting.

&gt;If not facilitating an extravagant lifestyle for them gives people an incentive to get the hell off them, then fine by me. Likewise, if people on HB want a spare room then they should fucking well pay for it.

People on benefits don't live an extravagant lifestyle and to suggest that they do is completely illogical. Here's an example of what by brother who is on ESA will be paying when these new measure kick in:

* bedroom tax (1 unused) = £11.20 pw
* council tax = £3.84 pw
* rent contribution = £12.50 pw
* total = £27.54 pw

He gets £71 pw on ESA. After those expenses he would be left with £43.46 pw. Subtract £20 pw for electricity and another £20 pw for food and that leaves £3.46. Please explain how it is even remotely possible to live an extravagant lifestyle on £3.46 a week?

&gt;And you know what? That's exactly what is happening and I'm fucking delighted about it. You can be pissed at the situation but it's not going to change. Be pissed. But you can't fucking change it :D

You can't escape the fact that it is mentioned in mainstream music television and film on nearly a daily basis so young adults are going to be curious, I know I was and I still  smoke to this day. The point is if parents were able to have a open discussion about cannabis rather than the unspeakable taboo it has become, in this country especially, it would lose its mystique or 'cool'. It seems that parents are quick reacting to the fact they've found their kid with a spliff and flipping their lid, but not being proactive and discussing its merits and cons before it gets to that point. In my own personal experiences I started smoking cannabis because I probably have depression and anxiety issues and found it helped but have steered clear from all other drugs, so proof be that it isn't a gateway drug but an alternative choice to alcohol which I rarely partake in. If only Mr Cameron would take his fingers out of his ear holes and give this topic the time of day it requires we might one day get somewhere. Recently a group of MPs announced their findings after a 6 year investigation into drug laws and cannabis and brought their report before the house and within an hour it was cast aside. So why are we so scared as nation of cannabis? Is it because of the Daily mail and other news outlets still pushing the demon weed message? Too many former MPs change their minds about Cannabis after being in office. It must be believed between MPs that if a party is in favour of legalisation that it will be toxic to their campaign for election. I do believe the tide will change on our fair isles and its thinking on Cannabis and things will be better for it. All eyes are now on America and how state by state they are slowly tearing down the walls that literally imprisoned innocent people who enjoy cannabis.

Again comparing to United and City, Chelsea only have one goal scorer.  Lukaku can come back (and lord knows i'm looking forward to that), but that still only leaves us with two strikers.  And moreover, Ba and perhaps even Lukaku don't give us that edge that propels us back amongst the title challengers.  We risk putting too much pressure on our young belgian.  He needs someone to learn off. And that definitely isn't Torres, and to a lesser extent not even Ba.

Once you are done with that go to Netflix again and make sure you watch all the specials with Tennant and then the Xmas ones with Matt Smith. FINALLY, watch some classics! :D They are waaaaayyy lower in budget and effects are almost non existent but the stories and sci-fi ideas they came up with so long ago are amazing. here are some of my top reccomendations you can find ON netflix. 

* The Aztecs

* The Mind Robber (one of my FAVS!)

* The Carnival of Monsters

* Pyramids of Mars

* City of Death

* The Pirate Planet

* The Androids of Tara

* The Caves of Androzani

People won't facilitate it. Granted, there's be a few people like you who genuinely believe in it, but people are ultimately easily corrupted. And once that happens they'll cotton on fairly fast to what's happened and put in measures to keep themselves in charge.


If you think that your political beliefs are so capable of changing things, have you perhaps run for MP? (That's a serious question btw, I'm not asking to it be snarky. I'm curious as to if you have. If you have, how'd you get on? How'd you find it, and was it something you felt to be worthwhile? If you've not, why not?).


Why does your brother have to have a flat with more then one bedroom to himself? Can't he live with someone else? Unless there's a genuine need for him to have another bedroom, the state should not fund it. I have said (to be fair, I don't think i said this to you)  that I feel the change in HB for surplus bedroom is unfair where people have a legitimate need for a spare bedroom. But I don't think that a spare room that is empty 90% of the time is a necessity and that HB should not fund this.


Plenty of people do live in flatshares, because they either can't afford to rent privately (we could live on our own, but then we would have to move out of the city centre which would be inconvenient for me as I'm planning on commuting to Glasgow from September for Uni - or we would potentially have less to save for our own flat. 

Flatsharing is the reality for most people. I don't see why some people should have to not live as the rest of us do. It creates a system where people on benefits have a luxury that working people do not and that is disgraceful. If you want your own house, go out and earn the money to pay for it. If part of that means you have to share with others for a few years to save the money to then so what? it'll make getting your own place al the sweeter when it happens.

Maybe your brother's got a legitimate reason for being on ESA (In the nicest possible way, I don't care) and if he has, then we should as a society support him until he is well enough to return to work. But that should mean where possible, those in that position make every effort to improve their health (a good example of someone I know who doesn't do this complains she cannot work as she has back pain, but is always posting pictures of herself on FB out drinking and dancing at the weekends. 


""When the poor take to the streets, rioting, smashing things up, burning shit down and start causing general mayhem, will you still hold to the same opinion?""


It won't happen. And if it does - if the only thing that riles people enough to do that is losing child benefit? Or a spare room that they don't need? Wow. You know what makes me fucking livid? That an ""advisor"" at CAB told me that I should ""get fired"" when my Husband was laid off, and take a few years off to have a kid. That way we could claim loads more benefits"". I wouldn't go rioting or vandalising stuff over that though because violence is the first resort of plebs and cretins. 

I can't understand why people think they should get a house, have a kid and have the state pay for it, and do loads of other shit that other people have to think long and hard about. Can't feed it? Don't breed it. Want a spare bedroom? Save and buy a house that meets your specifications rather than expecting the state to fund it.


I'm sorry but I just do not agree with you. I find the idea that people should rely on the state to pay for everything to be morally repugnant. It can't. It is not possible. Plus the planet is fucking crippled with people. We don't *need* people to keep having children. It's a selfish, egotistical lifestyle choice. 


""Well, I advocate direct democracy over the Internet, followed by socialism (worker control of the mean of production), following by communism (stateless and classless society) when the technology (something like Star Trek replicators) makes it possible.""

Yeah, that's not going to happen. Good luck with that.

- Tailor your CV to the role. I used to work in a camera shop and everyone handed in 4 page CVs that didn't mention photography once. they went straight in the bin...


- keep tweaking your CV constantly. if it's longer than 2 pages then it won't get read- don't devote pages to stuff you did in your teens if you're in your 30's etc. also FOR FUCKS SAKE make sure you use a generic font for your CV. I once spent 2 weeks sending out .doc files of my CV proudly written in sleek helvetica (typed on a mac) before i realised most PCs don't have this, and they were opening up as gobbledeegook!


- be aware that your chance of getting an interview is infinitely smaller if you apply for a permanent role with an agency. Treat jobs advertised directly by the company like gold dust! Agencies are GREAT for temp work, but you have to bug them constantly or they won't give a shit. 


- I'm sorry to say it, but do shit for free. Doesn't have to be a full internship or anything, but just do SOMETHING outside of work. I write a bit on a voluntary basis for a photography magazine, and that played a role in me getting my current job which partly involves product descriptions of camera equipment.


- **indeed.co.uk is great, it compiles loads of jobsearch sites (like compare the market or something but for job vacancies)**


- when describing your experience and skills, be as specific as possible. know microsoft office? then break down your skills in excel, word, outlook etc. and give very specific examples of how you used those situations at work, and what the outcome was

**TPB AFK: The Pirate Bay Away From Keyboard**

It’s the day before the trial starts. Fredrik packs a computer into a rusty old Volvo. Along with his Pirate Bay co-founders, he faces $13 million in damage claims to Hollywood in a copyright infringement case. Fredrik is on his way to install a new computer in the secret server hall. This is where the world’s largest file sharing site is hidden.

true,[deleted],null,null,"What I mean is that people who are going straight from full-time education to university (full-time education) have a _massive_ advantage in the form of zero gaps in work history, zero expectations, a qualification _and_ on-the-job experience with most courses. Coupled with the whole aging workforce thing, where graduates are hired at a lower salary to replace older, more accomplished workers doing a similar job, it's basically the best way to get into employment - though not at all a guarantee, and many of them will end up looking at the minimum wage roles whilst they look for something relevant to their degree.

EDIT: Or just coming straight out of school or sixth form/college: they're preferred for entry-level jobs because their minimum wage is lower and again they have an easily-explained lack of recent work history. Nobody expects to ask a 16 or 18 year-old why they only worked part-time instead of full-time at Waitrose stacking shelves, or KP'ing at the local hotel. ""Because of school, duh"".

Compound that with someone who's taken time off to do a gap year, or who left university prematurely to find work (like myself, mistakenly buying into the ""they like experience more than degrees shows you're a real person with real skills hurbleburble"" mantra) and got fucked by poor timing as the whole economical shitshow hit, you have a gap in your work history that can't be convincingly explained to an employer. You're not fresh out of full time education, nor do you have recent employment, and no amount of volunteer work or unpaid work experience or temporary 6 month placements are going to compensate for that at a mid-level position. So you're left looking at the minimum wage unskilled positions regardless of how many A-levels or years spent in a university course, and the longer you go without work the less employable you look to people because of the growing gap in your C.V. 

Then you've got mid-level people who have lost their jobs, or who have dependents and are in a similar issue, who reapply to university just to be eligible for a decent rate loan to tide them over and fill what would otherwise be that growing gap in their C.V., and then employers abusing the apprenticeship system so those are out - not that £2.65/hr is really viable unless you're a teenager looking to learn a trade rather than go to college anyway. So that's more people vying for these minimum wage roles.

It's all a bit of a jumbled mess and there's no clear-cut single issue that needs addressing. It's a big mess of issues all feeding each other, and results in people panicking or being pushed to desperation and applying only for unskilled positions they _know_ they can do and hold down with the expectation that it'll increase their chances of being hired. Basically all of these people and their representative sectors want a job that befits their skills, but nobody's giving them one so they're instead turning to and fighting over the minimum wage salary slave positions because there's no chance someone could say they're not qualified for that stuff.

That is not pest control by any means. Also they are indiscriminate with which fox they kill, no control over whether it is a dog of a vixen, or if it is part of the alpha pair. Foxes tend to regulate their breeding according to availability of food sources and if there are other breeding pairs in the area, hence the success of urban foxes. It is also worth nothing that fox hunts don't feel the urge to control urban foxes, whose territories often encroach onto farmland. I would argue that to control foxes, the easier and most efficient way is to control their food source, if we as humans were more careful with our rubbish and leftovers, we would not have 65% of the fox population as urban,

true,whencanistop,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"I suppose in a way it was hardly surprising with our job (web UX consultants didn't exist 5 or so years ago, so finding someone with agency experience was unlikely). 

My job role is surprising. I'm an analyst specialising with online data. My job is to look at data about what people do on websites, how their businesses work and how the wider web works to come up with general or specific changes (not just with site/marketing content/strategy/spend but also with organisational structure, training, skills, etc). Any finance analyst could do this, but they're over subscribed and we're really short of people. 

Why? Finance analysts won't come out of their comfort zone to learn a new industry (once in retail always in retail) or try and apply old techniques to a new problem (eg organisations based on a sales force always want visitor level data, but can rarely use anything other than anonymous trends). 

My path was to always get experience of different business models (I've done finance, retail, publishing,  government before I went agency side) and different teams (I've been in PM, insight, technical, marketing, ecommerce). Now my job choices are much wider and I have more options. 

That said, I started in the shittiest white collar job I could find that a mate of a mate's dad found, living at home and commuting two hours there and another two hours back for a pittance an hour.

IIRC he was criticising a young lady who'd tried to speak at the senate about women's rights/reproduction issues and said something like ""The only women on the pill are sluts who want to sleep around."" Paraphrased, but it was essentially that kind of message.

I've not read up on it (I might do it now) but the daughter was taking the pill to combat her heavy periods that left her feeling less-than-ace for a significant period of time every month. On a school trip a parent supervising dispensed medicine (kids weren't allowed to keep their own stuff) and must have told another parent/teacher. It got around and the girl was a pariah with some kids calling her a ""slut"" etc. in front of teachers with no consequences.

She doesn't seem to have written about it since that one entry last year. Shame.

One underlying motivation of this field of academic study is that epidemiology turned out to be a bit of disaster.

Looking back one notices that both effects are quite large (especially with the extreme exposure of asbestos workers) and the both illnesses are otherwise rare. Now the low hanging fruit have been plucked, epidemiology seems to be a source of confusion.

My feeling is that the big things footballers would have a hard time with when moving to a new place is language, food and social structure. Language would be a bit of an issue, but food and the social structure of Germany and Netherlands are very similar. Although again, even though Munich is a bit different I don't think it would instill a ""culture shock"" anywhere near playing in the RPL or even the MLS.

Ideally we would go in to next season with Falcao/Ba/Lukaku as the strike force, Ba has played alongside another striker numerous times up North as he drifted wide to accomodate Papiss Cisse. Even with the three of them I think Lukaku could get a solid 25-30 games, which is preferable to 40 games in somebody else's system. I hear you about Falcao and his peak, we'd be paying top Dollar with little to no resale value, but we aren't in a strong position right now and there are few options in the position available. We could also use another year on loan for Courtois as a bargaining chip. As I said, too many variables but I hope he stays and flourishes. Falcao is such a great all round player he could thrive in our system, strong enough to hold off a defender and very determined, he's a gamble but I'm on board with rolling the dice

Piazon looks good, De Bruyne looks better. KDB could play the central AM position while Piazon floated between roles until he develops a preference. Botha re still very young but I have high hopes for a Belgian contingent that may one day count for half the side; Courtois, Hazard, Lukaku, De Bruyne, Fellaini.

If that is to be taken as fun, then yes you are right, cock fighting badger baiting and dog fighting were all considered fun pastimes at one point, but they are all illegal now due to the cruelty factor. It may or may not be coincidence that those were all traditionally working class pastimes, and fox hunting has been the choice of the middle and upper classes. 

As we are one of the few ( if not the only) animal capable of cruelty, malice, and evilness of forthought, I would say we are perfectly placed to decide what is and isn't cruel. We have institutions like the RSPCA and NSPCC because we make these judgements. 

I could extend your argument to reductio absurdum levels but that does the discussion no good. I personally dislike the term 'humane' or 'inhumane', but essentially if an animal needs to be killed, say a cow, for meat production, then society would expect it to be done with as little stress and hurt as possible. (whether it is or isn't is another topic), If there is evidence that foxes need to be killed, then it should be in a controlled fashion, with planning and forethought as to which ones needs to be culled. 

I don't have much time for fox hunters, but I do appreciate it when they admit the do it just for fun, rather than out of any effort to control foxes, or because of tradition blah blah.

The first game I ever saw was the Champions League final in 2008 which we lost to Manchester United in penalty kicks. Ever since that game I've been addicted to Chelsea FC. There have been plenty other posts about the history of the team and the league. I wanted to give you a few tips for american soccer fans. 

This link will tell you when games are on tv in america, ESPN usually plays one game a week (its almost always the early kickoff which starts at 7am) there is also the occasional champions league game on Fox Sports. There are also a few channels such as Fox Soccer and Bein Sports, both of these have lots of games but usually they have to be purchased.
http://www.livesoccertv.com/

This is the link I use to stream the games (since most won't be on tv), since Chelsea is a big team you can usually find a good stream. Also, you can watch Chelsea TV on this site, which is a good way to get into all the inter-workings of the team.
http://www.firstrow1.eu/

This is a youtube series with the history of the club, the only problem being it only goes to 198-, but its still a really good way to get to know the history of the club.

But on the flipside, I think it's perfectly acceptable to treat sex casually. If you, as a consenting adult, wish to just go out and fuck a consenting man/woman, that's fine too.

I grew up in a semi-rural area, where [this group still meet every Boxing Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Hunt). Consequently we had the debate on and off quite often, particularly at school, in the years running up to the 'ban'. I recall the majority being against it at my school, though we had a number of farmer children and horse riders. A (vegetarian) friend of mine whose family rides had 3 or 4 brushes hanging in his bedroom for years.

Most people I know now who are in favour of hunting really enjoy it for the unfettered riding across land. I get that - I understand it. I'm not sure that warrants the practice being allowed though. Is there any other similar activity where people can ""get their rocks off"" in this way? Shooting &amp; fishing don't seem to be equatable in that regard.

Something I've never understood (though you might know the answer to) is one of the excuses given in favour and I even saw it given on here again the other day: It tends to be the old and sick that are picked off because they can't evade the hounds as well as younger, fitter animals.

If that were the case, then wouldn't that be a point against the practice? If you're failing to catch the young, strong animals - the ones that'll be around the longest and do damage to livestock etc. - then it's surely not the most efficient method?

Also, why is shooting ""not ethical"" (or similar) when it comes to foxes but alright for many other animals? Could be that they're harder to hit than rabbits, maybe, but that one has always confused me too.

true,jimicus,eng-somerset,"Where your aunt, your sister and your mum are the same person.","We have the most terrible education system when it comes to learning basic life skills like ""how to get a job"".

On the plus side, that means it's quite possible to hack the system. So, here's a few tips from someone who's been there (though mercifully not recently):

 - The scattergun approach - where you fill in as many application forms and send as many CVs off as you can, once it's sent off, forget about it - is one that's practically encouraged by the authorities when you sign on for JSA: ""if you haven't shown evidence of having applied for at least N jobs that you can show exist by giving us a copy of the advert, we'll cut your benefits"". It's also one of the least effective things you can do. Why? Well, I've been on the other side once or twice before - it is incredibly easy to spot an application that's been put together in this way, usually because the sender winds up putting out a standard letter and CV to everyone without really tailoring it to the recipient. If you're lucky they'll get the name of the person they're applying to; quite often they won't and it'll be ""Dear Sir or Madam"". When I've got 100 applications to go through, the ones that look like they have some interest in the job will get priority. Everyone else will go to one side.
  - Do what you have to to keep your benefits, but don't expect to get a job that way.
 - Far more effective is to take a more organised approach. Think of the things you'd like to do and the businesses in your area in which you might be able to do it. There's all sorts of ways you can put together a list of such organisations.
 - Find out who the decision makers in that business are. **DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES CONTACT HR**. Their job is to keep the business from making expensive hiring mistakes, and the easiest way they can do that is to keep the business from hiring anyone at all. There might be half-a-dozen people thinking the same thing: ""We need to hire someone else to do X..."" but if they haven't got around to putting the wheels in motion to hire someone (an incredibly common occurrence), all HR will do is ignore or politely refuse any applications that come in.
   - Ask your friends, ask your relations, search online. Whatever. But make sure you find out the full name and job title of the person you need to contact.
   - Years ago you used to be able to get this name out of whoever answered the phone on reception. Very difficult to do these days as many companies have adopted a ""no names"" policy, but you might get somewhere trying this with smaller businesses.
   - If you're uncertain about who to contact, try and get the details of the next person up in the chain of command. Someone who wants their staff to operate efficiently will gladly pass applications down as appropriate; someone who's busy building their own little empire might not bother to pass them sideways. 
 - Prioritise businesses that look like they might be growing. Moving to bigger premises? Opening another branch? Contact these guys first.
 - Find out as much about the business as you can. Who to speak to, what they've been doing lately, what their business model is. Spend some quality time on their website making sure you know all about it, but also use Google to see what others have said.
 - Once you know who you need to speak to, you need to contact them. Personally, I would be inclined to use snail-mail for the initial contact. Why? Because email's very easy to delete without thinking, even easier to wind up in an automated spam filter. Send a letter that is specific to their business - highlight a couple of things you know they do and explain why you think you can help them. Enclose a CV that has also been tweaked to what you think they might need. If you've done the groundwork and you know about the business, this bit should be a doddle.
   - Basic stuff, but print onto good-quality paper, make sure your printer is producing good-quality output and use your best handwriting in blue or black ink on the envelope. I've seen perfectly good applications thrown in the bin simply because the sender couldn't be bothered to clean a dirty printhead. A5 envelopes are preferable to DL (those ones where 
   - Some people prefer a functional type of CV, others prefer a more conventional chronological type. I'm a big believer in the functional type because it puts all the important information right at the top, employers don't have to drill through your life history and try to figure out for themselves how you might be suited to a job.
   - Get someone else to proof-read it. By now, you've read your CV a million times and you are quite literally blind to any mistakes - I could sneak onto your computer and add ""Kitten stomping"" to your list of hobbies and there's a good chance you'd send that to all your potential employers for the next 6 months.
 - Call them a few days later to ask if they got your letter and ask if there's anything they'd like to discuss.

You won't get anywhere near as many applications sent out taking this approach, but you'll get far more positive responses and hopefully an interview and ultimately a job far more quickly. It will be hard work - it's much harder than just tracking down an email address or an online form - and you will get rejections because you're speaking to people personally and they can't simply ignore your application and pretend it doesn't exist.

Don't take these rejections personally - until you're hired, a prospective employer sees you in the exact same way you see a bunch of bananas in Tescos. The bananas don't take it personally that you've chosen a different bunch, nor should you. 

Alas, you will also get a few incredibly rude people on the phone - people who seem to think that by daring to intrude on their time you should be paraded through town with a sign around your neck - when you get one of these, apologise for having inconvenienced them, put the phone down and make a note never to contact that company again.

What worries me is Lukaku becoming unsettled by having to compete with two well established strikers. If we have the trio of Falcao/Ba/Lukaku how do we play with them? Ba may have experience with a partner but Falcao has always played a solo role. Do you think it would work best to rotate all three and give them time as lone strikers? Play Falcao alone up top but play Lukaku and Ba in a paired striker formation? What it comes down to for me, is showing faith in Lukaku that he will be our number one in a few years time because neither Ba nor Falcao are going to be long term strikers. If we can do that even with the purchase of Falcao then I'm perfectly fine with that.

true,SMTRodent,eng-nottinghamshire,Back in Nottnum,"Well, you'd had very many places thrown at you, nearly all excellent, but even the UK isn't so small that you could sanely drive to all of them in one trip, so I tried to collect as many as possible into one journey that's actually possible, while bearing in mind the fact you want to see things that aren't obvious or known (so, for example, the Nottingham part has no mention of Sherwood Forest or the Major Oak).

I tried for scenic routes where possible, and places where there is more than one thing to see or do, with a definite bias towards history, culture and nature. My spouse likes driving, and thinks nothing of putting in 150 miles in a day, so I based it also on routes he likes to take.

true,Variola13,null,null,"&gt;Most people I know now who are in favour of hunting really enjoy it for the unfettered riding across land. I get that - I understand it. I'm not sure that warrants the practice being allowed though. Is there any other similar activity where people can ""get their rocks off"" in this way? 

Riding unfettered across land is understandably desirable, but they can still do that (with landowners permission). 

&gt;Is there any other similar activity where people can ""get their rocks off"" in this way? Shooting &amp; fishing don't seem to be equatable in that regard.

There is the practise of laying a trail, where one of the hunt members lays a false trail so the dogs can follow it and the hunt is recreated for the riders and those on foot, with the benefit of being able to enjoy the countryside. Unfortunately this has proved problematic, the hunts have been known to use this excuse when the dogs have still gone after a fox (or any other hapless creature that gets in the way), or the dogs have apparently preferred the scent of the fox to the false trail and chased the fox anyway. I am personally unconvinced of the latter, the dogs are intelligent and well trained. 

&gt;Something I've never understood (though you might know the answer to) is one of the excuses given in favour and I even saw it given on here again the other day: It tends to be the old and sick that are picked off because they can't evade the hounds as well as younger, fitter animals.
If that were the case, then wouldn't that be a point against the practice? If you're failing to catch the young, strong animals - the ones that'll be around the longest and do damage to livestock etc. - then it's surely not the most efficient method?

Yep you raise a good point. As it is, it can be argued that it is the older foxes that are picked off, but that is certainly not always the case. The hounds can pick up any scent, and once they have it that is it. It really is indiscriminate, sometimes it is cubs that are chased, (depending on season) because they are smaller and less experienced than their parents, and also they are easier to 'dig out', with the terrier etc. 

&gt;Also, why is shooting ""not ethical"" (or similar) when it comes to foxes but alright for many other animals? Could be that they're harder to hit than rabbits, maybe, but that one has always confused me too.

Anyone who is skilled with a shotgun should be able to get a fox without problem, it takes time, and planning, but like badgers foxes are creatures of habit.

Whilst I can't get the GPA needed for a sandwich placement, they say that most courses for postgraduates require a GPA above 7.5. This means that an undergraduate placement here looks more than achievable. It also seems highly likely that you will pass the English language requirement.

I may be a little biased as I will be studying there later this year if everything goes to plan, but the university has a great reputation and is consistently high in the rankings. Additionally, the campus and the area is lovely; it's literally the wealthiest region of the UK, with accommodation less than 10 meters away from the Royal Albert Hall.

If you want to aim higher, then there's the University of Cambridge; the top university in the country for the subject. It's much harder to get in, and you typically need to be in the top 2% of your country to stand a chance. I believe you'll also need to complete extra courses.

It's going to be difficult to find information on the exact grades you'll need because so few people need to know this information, but the university advises that you contact them - see the third paragraph [here](http://www.study.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/international/requirements.html).

true,widgetas,null,null,"&gt; She was proposing abstinence advocacy, certainly.

In effect it was abstinence only. If it passed then schools would be required to teach abstinence, or advocate abstinence, if you prefer. But currently schools are not required to teach any sort of sex ed (save basic biology) and so some schools teach none at all (these schools have particular values they like to instill in their pupils, you see). So if there is legislation that makes it the case that abstinence advocacy must be taught, then the only sex ed girls *must* get is ""abstinence"". Ergo, abstinence only in all but name.

It was widely understood at the time that this was an abstinence only bill ""by the back door"" (no pun intended).

&gt; And why shouldn't girls be taught that they have the right to say no?

I don't think anyone said that kids shouldn't be told this, though I imagine it was some kind of allegation levelled at Dorries detractors. Currently many schools do tell their pupils that they can say no. My own experience and a straw poll of my (female) siblings indicated that this is not necessarily an uncommon practice (we attended different schools). However, the fact that this legislation was aimed solely at girls should give an indication as to the somewhat backward mindset behind this bill: Why *girls* only?

Also to indicate where Dorries is coming from she said this shortly after:

&gt;  ""If a stronger ‘just say no’ message was given to children in school, there might be an impact on sex abuse, because a lot of girls, when sex abuse takes place don’t realise until later that was a wrong thing to do... I don’t think people realise that if we did empower this message into girls, imbued this message in school, we would probably have less sex abuse""

Her brain 'ain't right'. And what she says is factually and demonstrably wrong, again.

&gt; advocating abstinence isn't inherently evil.

Not at all, but within the current system it would be retrograde given that a bill to bring in compulsory coherent sex education failed to get a second reading a few years back.

No quite, I can well understand it. However if we allowed the practise to continue because a small minority enjoyed it, then we could use the same argument for anything from driving at excessive speeds to paedophila. 

&gt;How do you mean?

Foxes tend to live in small family groups, alpha breeding pair and usually the last seasons cubs, depending on the territory and availability of food. Only the alpha pair breed, other vixens to not come into season, and both younger dogs and vixens help the parents with the cubs. Only when there is a strong chance of gaining a territory of their own do the younger foxes leave the family group. The family group territory is likely to have existed for years, when one or both of the alpha pair is killed, the younger foxes in the family group take over the territory and breed. 

Fox territories are maintained by marking and scenting, rarely do they overlap much unless there is a large surplus of food. They hunt at the same times of the day/night so with planning you can tell roughly where they will be and at what time.

I don't think about it, but if, on the off chance my Husband and I split up and if we had kids, I would happily cough up towards his extra rent for keeping a spare room. I'd start my appealing the decision, but if that didn't work out then I'd happily pay the extra rent for him (this is going on the basis that I don't see us getting divorced, but things happen and people change).

&gt;Aha, so taking out a fox isn't going to be as tough for a marksman as it is sometimes implied? Of course given that they're territorial it stands to reason that they'll visit particular points to scent.

Even if you don't find their scent points, you can find the den, then assess which foxes are the problem and need to be culled, if any. It is certainly not the 'oh but they will be injured and die in agony' excuse that people make, that would only happen if untrained idiots did it. You could also trap ( not snare) foxes and then shot them while in the box trap. That was the technique proposed for culling badgers until the govt did its u-turn on it. 

It is still worth remembering that the pro-hunt lobby, while chucking out the blurb about pest management and culling, have conveniently missed out the urban fox, of which the total UK population of foxes, urban make up about 64%. Urban foxes can still encroach onto farmland, and are still free to take up new territories on farmland.

There's always apprehension before the player makes that final step up to the top level which Courtois has successfully done and KDB is well on the way to doing. It's difficult to say who will play where so far in advance but I think KDB has the edge in terms of his ability to play further back while Oscar edges it in the forward areas. A first world problem though, can never have too many of those

Ba played wider left a bunch for Newcastle, of course this limits width due to his natural positioning in the centre but it's an option and can surprise the opposition. United were playing Hernandez, Welbeck and RvP yesterday with a fair amount of switching that created space and gaps for others to run in to, defenders tend to lose their man when said man is one of 3 different people. The glory days of Robben and Duff were largely due to their switching and cutting in on their stronger foot so both were afforded time on each side

Speaking of Ba, it's clear he isn't a long term solution but we knew Sturridge was on his way out and we needed a replacement. The value of his transfer was low enough where consistent years of performance aren't a necessity to constitute a good deal and if he can do a job for a season or two before moving on then that is fine by me. We need to have a talisman up front that stands alongside the likes of RvP, Cavani, Aguero and Falcao seems to be the best option. Assuming we play a 60-65 game season and accounting for injuries there is enough time to spread between 3 strikers, especially when one of them is still perfecting his trade. The trio of Falcao, Lukaku and Ba would also be a nice mix of power, pace and technique. You also have the option of bringing a new striker on to aid the one on the pitch should we be behind, right now we lack attacking options off the bench.

Now you have clarified on this i know what you meant. But if you love someone and you are both physically and mentally attracted to each other your going to want to show it. 

You can't just say that you wouldn't have sex because this isn't a solution, people have sex all the time, and although the best protection against pregnancy is not to have sex this is not always what people want.

&gt;I don't think about it, but if, on the off chance my Husband and I split up and if we had kids, I would happily cough up towards his extra rent for keeping a spare room. I'd start my appealing the decision, but if that didn't work out then I'd happily pay the extra rent for him (this is going on the basis that I don't see us getting divorced, but things happen and people change).

And what if you couldn't afford to help with their rent, because you were also struggling yourself? Appeal? Yeah, good luck with that. The government have made their position clear.

&gt;I really think that people in that situation are in the minority. Maybe I'm wrong, and I really hope that the people I know on benefits aren't representative of everyone on them, but the people I've met on benefits so far really aren't poorly off at all.

At the moment they are, yes. When these measure are implemented though, people on benefits will be a lot worse off and many people will not be able to survive on them. Their only option at that point is to turn to crime. Like I said, things are going to get worse as production becomes more automated and developing nations develop. This coupled with the benefit cuts and the inevitable rise in crime will push even law-abiding citizens over the edge.

Currently we have 559 engineering and other technological areas students in the UK and 108 of these are among the top 10 universities for Civil Engineering (ranked according to the Complete University Guide). Only 3 went to Cambridge and other 9 to the Imperial College. The ones who most accepted students from the programme are Surrey (27) and Newcastle (28). 

I planned on aim high on 2 of my picks and go with a safer choice on the third. Since these rankings often do not offer information on the branch of expertise these Universities are strong inside that course. 

I'm sure I would be very happy to be accepted to Cambridge, but what if the research group of the Imperial College, only 1 position lower in the ranking, is much more close to the areas I'm intending to follow? Right now I'm trying to narrow my choices to be able to make a deep research on each one further down the road. And, of course, counting with the help from the people who know the British Universities better, the British!

Regarding to the language requirements the program requires either IELTS or TOEFL minimum scores. I took the TOEFL test last year and my score is enough to be accepted.

Since there's no point in wasting a pick on a university that won't accept me anyway, I'll surely follow you suggestion and try to contact some of them to better know their specific requirements. I'll also try to contact the students who went to the better ranked ones and check if they don't bother to share with me their GPAs or if they had to do anything different.

true,Friskyinthenight,null,null,"Look mate, I understand your position but:

* The government say the laws are based on evidence about a substances ability for harm, if that is the case then alcohol and tobacco should be illegal.

* Cannabis is not *harmless*, but it is no more harmful than many other substances and food products that people consume every day. There has never been a single recorded death attributed to cannabis, ever. Smoking it is probably the most harmful, and it does not have to be smoked, it can be vaporized, made into a tincture or eaten, which negates the harmful effects of smoking.

* Cannabis may have potential to help fight some forms of cancer and it's medicinal uses are huge, not to mention the industrial uses of it's sister plant, hemp.

* It also helps people with mental illnesses like depression and anxiety disorders, although not in all cases of course. This alone should make you question your position, it has literally hundreds of applications medically, from helping cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy to eat, to helping people with multiple sclerosis stop shaking and allowing them to function relatively normally. 

* Prohibition of cannabis, does not work, has created a huge black market that funds organised crime, and nothing is made back in tax. From a purely economic standpoint cannabis should absolutely be legal, I challenge you to find someone fluent in economics to disprove this.

* Finally, I mean really, if it is controlled and regulated like tobacco and alcohol is, what are you afraid will happen? Everyone will suddenly go out and get baked? Prohibition of cannabis has made it easier than ever for young people to get their hands on drugs, dealers do not ask for ID. Regulation and taxation would not only bring over £5 BILLION per year in tax revenue, but also limit access. Not enable it.

Personally, i recognize myself as English. I was born and raised in England, and have lived here for all but 1 year of my life. Linda Colley, a rather prominent historian on matters of national identity said ""we  usually decide who we are by reference to who and what we are not"", so by that standard i am most assuredly English. 

The idea of national identity is nothing more than concocted projections to give an idea of individuality to the outside world, when the 4 nations decided to try and distil the quintessential elements of what it meant to be English, Scottish, Northern Irish, and Welsh. The idea that Englishness didn't mean Britishness, and vice-versa, is a relatively modern concept.

I present identify however as being British. I love the combined culture of the British isles. We are as unique as any set of nations in the world, yet this archipelago can band together seamlessly at times, and i am lucky enough to have friends from all corners of Britain who all recognise their social national identity, but feel no coldness to using the term 'British'.",0,1361317229,null,0,false,0,c8i44ku,t3_18tvt7,t1_c8i44ku,t3_18tvt7,null,1431344594,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Spid8r,null,null,"Cool.  Nice and quick, FFP means a club can only spend what you make out of football related income.  Sponsorship, TV money, prize money, etc are all counted against player wages, transfers, stadium upkeep, etc.  Whatever is left over, you can spend how you like (eg - buying new players).  If you are in the negative, you can't play in UEFA comps (Champs League, Europa).  So in a nutshell, it doesn't matter if a club has 148 Trillion dollars in the bank, if they don't make any money, they can't spend any.  The rules come into affect next season, but use the books from the previous few seasons to work out how much a club has made/spent.  That is why we saw that crazy transfer window where Torres went for 50 million and Andy Carrol went for 35 million.  That was the last window you could spend cash and it would not be counted in the new FFP calculations.  

That is why every article where some idiot reporter says that ""only big clubs like City, Chelsea, Real, etc can afford someone are full of sh*t, how much money you have in the bank means jack all now.  

City are on track to break even if we get another good year in the books (and big sponsorship helping a lot.  Mario too), which means we can maintain our current players and wages which is fine by me and should see us competing well.  So we will hopefully be able to spend any money we make on player sales as long as the salaries are around the same.  Chelsea and United are about the same.  The best looking EPL club at the moment in regards to FFP are probably Arsenal, with their low wages compared to income.  If they don't completely fall apart fan wise (they still buy shirts and go to games), they will be the big hitters in the transfer world in the EPL anyway.",0,1361319642,null,0,false,0,c8i4x50,t3_18sp2i,t1_c8i4x50,t1_c8i35gy,null,1431344980,1,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,1

So that leaves no possibility that Ian, Grant, Becky, Wilson, Dugdale, Alice or Arby could return without going into  the contrived bullshit the first season managed to avoid, for the most part at least.

Jessica Hyde was the least interesting character in the whole show (not to mention that her plot is pretty damn well sewn up by this point also) and whilst Milner was a great villain it won't be entertaining watching a new bunch of misfits and unfortunate souls peel away the layers of conspiracy.

true,tyhoward,null,null,"GK - This is tough, we need an interim guy that won't threaten Courtois. I don't like Begovic for his 'guaranteed' playing time nonsense in his contract. Ideally, I would like Freidel but I doubt that would happen. If not I think I would be ok with Paul Robinson for a true backup. I saw something about Diego Alves possibly being available too. (I dont know too much about available GKs.)

CB - If Wallace does come to train this summer, we could possibly have Bruma and him compete to be a part of the squad. We would have some solid depth and development. If we make a move for a transfer, Ogbonna has been fantastic and so has Marquinhos - another Brazilian with something close to a 90 tackle percentage this term. Don't count out Ake though.

LB/RB - At RB Dave has overachieved thus far and hopefully he keeps improving. Ivanovic is good cover but his pace hurts us at times. I would like to dream that Hutchinson is in the squad at the start of next term, but overall we should be fine at RB. I think we are set at LB too, Bertrand can improve and fill in when Cole needs it. Our emergency guys in Ake, Luiz may be enough.

DM - Luiz shows some real promise here but I still see him at CB. I really like Romeu and believe in Mikel more than most. Assuming Essien returns, he should compete with these two. I dont want anyone else here so we can see McEachran, Chalobah fight to stay with the squad and maybe give de Bruyne a shot after the season hes had. Ramires and Lampard will be involved often pairing with earlier players mentioned and maybe we add a player here to go with these two. I don not want Fellaini to bring his long-ball game to Chelsea, he is completely overrated for what he does. I was really hoping we would take Sissoko in January but that option is gone. 

AM - We are just deadly here. Oscar, Hazard, Mata have shown they are elite and have the 3 will allow for a good rotation throughout the year. The only issue is I hate when they all play together. Moses is an unreal talent IMO and having another player like him would make us unstoppable. I suggest looking at Driers Mertens, he is in the prime of his career and is similar to Moses but more of a LF than RF. It may be his time to move on from PSV to a better league and did I mention hes Belgian? 

ST - So the only true ST we can guarantee having is Ba, Torres may be shipped out (my situation here assumes he is gone). As I said above, I DO NOT want Falcao solely based on Lukaku. I have watched Lukaku for 3 years and see such potential in him leading a team. I believe Lukaku comes in to compete with a TBD ST for the secondary spot behind Ba. I know 3 ST is still a bit thin but Moses is some one to consider long-term as a ST - think Walcott recently and previously Henry. Let Moses be the emergency player here. Our new signing I hope is Bony, he is raw but could be a star. I like that hes in-form and would contribute right away after he finishes this season, plus his price would be no more than 13M.",0,1361329960,null,0,false,0,c8i8b8o,t3_18tmwm,t1_c8i8b8o,t1_c8i6dem,null,1431346652,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

Regardless of whatever justification people like Dubya used for invading the Middle-East, it's not sanctioned anywhere in the New Testament.

Secondly, while the Bible does contain passages which largely describe brutal episodes of war, it seldom if ever actually exhorts followers to go out and massacre unbelievers.  In fact, as is well known, the fifth/sixth command (depending on which order you go for) specifically decrees ""you shall not kill/murder"".  One of the few places where God actually directly speaks to his people.  

The Quran on the other hand has numerous passages where muslims are instructed to go out and kill.  Some of them are explained away by apologists who claim they're misunderstood, but really, it's difficult to see much subtle alternative meaning behind phrases like ""fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, and seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war)"".

CB - Wallace is a right back so I don't think this helps too much. We do have Kane kicking around with the youth team and he might be a better choice since he's a natural right back and climatized to England, albeit very young and raw. Omeruo showed poise at CB during the ACON though, so maybe that's a nice squad player we can use next season and he can play either CB or RB.

DM - Would love another all-action, physical guy here, I think we're missing that and Essien doesn't really have that step he used to. Like a Ramires sort, but less stamina and more power. Would be great. 

AM - Cahill would murder Mertens if he came here. No. We do have Kakuta on loan, maybe he could add some support, and of course KDB could play either left wing or CAM if needed. No reinforcements needed.

ST - Lukaku can't lead a team on his own yet.

I love your idea for a DM, Ramires is fantastic but does lack physicality that would be great for the position. Essentially it would be great to see the next Essien come in, I cannot identify one right now. I think we are set at AM, but I think we need another player similar to Moses. I dont think Lukaku can lead a team, but we really risk losing him for good if we get Falcao.
