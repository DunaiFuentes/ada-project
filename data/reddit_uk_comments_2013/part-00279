7 has some issues as well because Amy and Rory overstay their welcome and don't have (in my opinion) a great sendoff. I will say that 11 is great when he has a chance to get away from his companions and just seems super whimsical, like in the Christmas specials.

That being said, the second half of 7 is great (especially the last few episodes) and the 50th Special is phenomenal, so I'd recommend sticking with it. If you are going to be a fan of Who, you have to put up with some stinkers I'm afraid. But currently the show is on something of a hot streak and I'd be really surprised in Smith's sendoff was a letdown. I think the writing for Clara has been a step up from the latter-day Ponds.

Concerning River:

You are not alone, and I would consider myself a middle man on the lady. The idea of her isn't bad, but the execution is confusing because they keep saying the ways things are instead of showing. They met each other backwards? They see each other a lot but based on everything we see as an audience they barely know each other (or one barely knows the other while the other knows them well)? Yet somehow they are in love while also not acting too fond of each other? It's weird, but has its moments for me.

With Gerrard on the pitch, it looks like he is the only one not on the same page as everyone as far as tempo and direction are concerned. He still contributes a lot in his own way, but it isn't very team oriented.

Biggest surprise - Suarez - performance wise, nothing has changed. I think the goals are coming more frequently because the team around him is playing so much better and setting him up. In the past, he has had to create his own chances. The surprising part has been his attitude and leadership. For everything that happened in the summer, he is playing with 10x more passion and intensity than ever has.

true,EleventhHourGhost,k9,K-9,"The real world explanation has been said a few times already: there was no plan for the show to last 50 years (in fact, it was lucky to have made it to two weeks!) and at the time the Doctor himself didn't even have much of a back story, let alone the rest of the characters and villains. Regeneration, Time Lords, time wars, Rassilion and Davros were all to come yet. Given that the show was not supposed to be about monsters and aliens but rather history and science, the Daleks were meant to be one-shot characters; it was their unexpected popularity that saved &amp; made Doctor Who. By the time you get to the new(est) version of the show, there's a ton of history built up and so many writers and show runners have had their say that the details get a little lost. Add to that the fact that so few casual viewers of the show would have seen the very early episodes, and get a fairly scrambled continuity.

Remember that prior to the 2005 resurrection, continuity was pretty loose - several showrunners considered it unimportant and did not think viewers would want to get bogged down in that sort of thing.  TV viewing was a casual thing; it wasn't until the Twin Peaks/Buffy/X-files era that you actually had mainstream dramas that expected their viewers to follow long running stories and watch a series from beginning to end.

But in universe? Why, making this stuff fit is half the fun! 
You could say that yes, this is the first time a Time Lord and the Daleks meet.  The Doctor runs into them before they even leave their planet. But it's his very interaction that drives them to become an interplanetary species. The expand and extend, and realise quickly that not only is time travel possible, but there are those who have set themselves up as Lords of it. So secretly they develop time travel, and begin the opening moves of a war... At first, going back and changing their own history, giving themselves an unbeatable advantage over every race they encounter.

Perhaps their existence was known to the Time Lords, but only by some and kept secret - the (1st) Doctor's blundering ruined that plan and it is his own mistake that caused them to be the threat they are; hence the special nature of his relationship with them - why, of all the enemies he faces, he never shows them any mercy, no second chances, and why they are always very aware of his presence in any situation.

Certainly messing with their own time line would get the attention of the Time Lords, if they weren't already watching the Daleks. So the Time Lords put a stop to it, altering their history again to one where they don't develop time travel. But the Daleks were prepared...maybe left messages in their own history, maybe found a way to save some agents outside the interference of the Time Lords... and they revert their history back, and now we're off to the races with a fully fledged Time War.

By now, the Time Lords are well aware of them. Perhaps at first they were hamstrung by their own policy of interference; their opening salvoes too small for fear of collateral damage to other races; interference from rogue agents (the Doctor is not the only Time Lord who ran away, after all) at the wrong time causes their predictions to be off... After all, the Master was once executed by the Daleks for some reason.

I think it has been said that Gallifrey exists ""outside of time""; certainly trying to think of a linear history for a society that can alter their own past is difficult. While from the perspective of the First Doctor, for instance, it could well be the first time they have met... but then by the time we get to later Doctors, the Time Lords could have altered things so that they met earlier.

My biggest disappointment has been Moses, I thought he showed a lot of promise at Chelsea, Wigan, and with Nigeria but he seems lost when he's on the pitch with us. Dribbling is in his blood but Rodger's game does not necessitate taking players on one on one unless your name is Luis Suarez. Sterling is in the best form of his short career so far and looks dangerous every time he gets the ball, the difference between him and Moses so far this year is that Sterling has figured out when to take on his man or lay it off and move to space.

true,_njd_,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"I'm white British and I feel like my country hates me,  because I work in the public sector, I'm fairly liberal in my views and I can't agree with the rhetoric I see in the papers and coming out of the mouths of our political leaders when they bang on about Britain being ""full"" or immigration being out of control.  
So in that sense I feel (to use the rhetoric of the Mail and the Express) I'm a stranger in my own country,  that this is not my country any more. Not because of immigration or the visibility of other cultures, but because of the voices shrieking for ""them"" to be sent back where they came from.

It does feel like a return to the 1970s or 1960s when people seem to be universally afraid of anyone who has dark skin or a different way of praying.

I grew up in an area with a large Pakistani population, during the years when people still daubed NF on walls. I didn't have much to do with them socially apart from knocking around together at school; didn't go round to their homes or have them round at mine; but I never felt any animosity towards Asians or from them.

I now live in an area with a mostly white British population (it's *not* why I chose to live there), but there are growing communities of Polish people and migrants from the Baltic states like Latvia and Lithuania. I don't have a problem with this. I have neighbours and acquaintances who are German and Bulgarian,  work colleagues who are from India and Hong Kong. Even from Ireland. Because I've actually met them and talk to them, I know that _they_ are people too.  
So I can't understand the current and revived hatred as anything but ignorance. Our politicians and papers are promoting ignorance and disdain instead of warmth and generosity and understanding.

I hope it's a generational thing. I've read elsewhere that the average age of the Daily Mail reader is now 58, simply because younger people (say under about 45) aren't reading it,  or don't take it seriously.

In other words, I think (I hope)  that most of the people who are so opposed to dark faces and continue to use the word ""paki""  are the same ones who were doing it thirty or forty years ago.

Unfortunately it's people of that generation who decide the headlines; but I think their influence is on the decline,  which is why the headlines are more urgent and vitriolic than before.",0,1387783135,null,0,1387798198,0,ce8cbvk,t3_1tiaka,t1_ce8cbvk,t3_1tiaka,null,1428018688,157,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,157

I do care about why you're so aggressive. I really do. I think you have a problem. 

Anyway,  counterpoint:

&gt;and kids get bullied every day for any number of reasons, or just because the bully felt like it. People also generally don't give a fuck about strangers, or feel the need to hold their hand and go ""you're British and we want you here!"".

But what the OP is experiencing is not just people choosing not to hold his hand, not just people who don't give a fuck,  but people who are opposed to him being here. 

Also, I don't think any bullying should be just accepted. Yeah,  people get bullied. Some of them commit suicide. Because they were bullied. It's not enough just to shrug your shoulders and say ""It happens"". 

I don't want to tolerate intolerance.

&gt;What a whiny pseudo sob story.

You're all heart, aren't you?

&gt; For the past couple of decades up until recently, Europe had tried far harder than most places in history to accommodate immigrants and minorities

Maybe,  but the OP is making the point that in the last few years Britain is not trying hard enough,  or that not enough people in Britain are trying. 

&gt; and you're making it out to be like you're the Jews in Nazi Germany or something.

It seems to be heading in that direction. The Nazis didn't come out of nowhere. They and several other racist groups and parties emerged gradually during an economic crisis when people had no jobs and little money and were looking for someone to blame. This is how it starts.

&gt;&gt;I don‚Äôt expect any one of you to understand.

&gt;Yes, no one could ever understand your arduous plight. Tell us o persecuted one...

I see he was right. Because you obviously don't understand and won't even try. 

&gt; how you are ever able to survive with a few newspaper headlines about immigrants from the same background as you, with also plenty more walking on eggshells about the subject.

It's not just the headlines - it's the effect of the headlines on how people perceive immigrants or any other minority that gets repeatedly slagged off in the press. What appears in the papers one day gets shouted in the street the next.

&gt;Why don't you drop the victim complex and just be a fucking adult?

I think you could have worded that better. Or maybe you couldn't. Maybe you lack the intelligence. Who am I to judge?

What saddens me more is that without the political will, there doesn't seem to be much we can do about this. Public opinion has been twisted and exploited by the media, and now more than ever you are likely to hear people say the cruelest of things, while they prattle on about how they enjoy being so wilfully politically incorrect. 

Unfortunately this subreddit, too, is generally hostile towards people like you. The people here, it seems, don't like being called out on their racism, and instead prefer to live inside their comfortable little bubbles where racism hasn't existed since slavery was abolished, and everyone who dares say otherwise is told to ""stop being so easily offended"" or to ""grow up"".

I feel like I should tell you to give this country another chance, but I think I've lost that right. Maybe things will get better some day, who knows?

But in I don't think it's unreasonable for an employee to request that they be excused from handling alcohol in a general, for whatever reason, and for the shop to accommodate them where possible.

What bothers many is the idea that a group of people we don't understand (Muslims) are trying to change things to suit their religious views. Look at the marks and spencer story from yesterday. It's not THAT big a leap from - I don't want to touch pork so I refuse to sell it to you - to - pork shouldn't be on sale at all anywhere. Look at the groups walking round part of the UK saying 'stop being gay - this is a Muslim area etc'. Yes these are a tiny minority - we get that, but it's a scary precedent particularly as Islam has a habit of usually erring on the side of 'radical' given enough time.

I'm sure my reply will get buried, but I'm going to write it anyway, because I feel as passionate about our country as you once did.

It's a sad fact of life that there are always a few bad eggs in the basket. And it's those bad eggs that get written about and get noticed and get the attention. Not everyone is bad. In fact, most people aren't bad. But it's sometimes hard to see that.

There will always be racists. But there will always be many, many times more good people than racists. And if you can find the strength to look past those racists, you will see that, and hopefully will come to love this country that we both call home again.

Of course, good and bad works on both sides. There are a small number of Muslims who are intolerant of non-Muslims too. I know that they're a small minority. All of the Muslim people I know are friendly, tolerant, good people. But the press don't write about the friendly, tolerant, good people that I know. They write about the few bad eggs. And when faced with such a barrage of bad press, it's not hard to see why the ranks of the white racists are growing. I truly hope that this trend doesn't continue, and I believe it won't continue for very long.

Would that also apply to someone who was under 18?  If the person on the till had said ""I'm sorry, I can't serve you, I'm only 17, you'll have to use another till"" then would we be saying that people under 18 shouldn't be working in M&amp;S, or indeed anywhere that sells alcohol for that matter?

If you walk past some Rangers fans in a Celtic jersey you might feel ""the evil persecution"" as well.


&gt;Also, I don't think any bullying should be just accepted. Yeah, people get bullied. Some of them commit suicide. Because they were bullied. It's not enough just to shrug your shoulders and say ""It happens"".

You are aware that a person or people can actually be partly to blame for something, right? it's not always scapegoats. However, OP doesn't claim to be a new immigrant. Regardless, the social issues don't seem to be from lack of money, as the OPs post even says.

I understand that he's quite the whiny bitch. Am I only to be considered as ""understanding it"" if I have an unnecessary amount of sympathy and/or crocodile tears? OP probably has some fantasy idea of what the life of a non-Pakistani Brit is like, which involves no one almost ever treating you like shit for whatever reason. The whole thing reads like a first-world problems edition of persecution and discrimination.

The OP makes no attempt to understand why people might dislike immigrants in the slightest, and simply blames them for not being trusting, as if they're not allowed to be of anyone. It's only ""me me me"". No mention of the actual bad immigrants or bad people of Pakistani descent(most of whose families relatively recently), who if were somehow all gone would make a lot his problems go away.

true,Cheezdizzle,null,null,"Let's just have a look at the numbers shall we.

The average points tally for premier league winning teams at the end of a season is **86** points. 

The highest was **95** points from Chelsea in 04/05, and the lowest was **75** points from Man U in 96/97.

Everton is currently on **34** points after **17** games with **21** matches still to play.

* In the average case, where we need to get to 86 points, we'd need to get another 52 points. This would require something along the lines of: **16 W, 4 D, 1 L**

* In the worst case, i.e. 95 points at the end of the season, we'd need 61 more points, which is only possible if we blitz it: **20 W, 1 D, 0 L**

* In the best case (41 more points) it'd be possible to win the title with something like: **12 W, 6 D, 3 L**

Our form so far this season is: **9 W, 7 D, 1 L**.

The conclusion I draw from this is that if Everton were to have a shot at winning the title, we'd have to perform *significantly* better than we have so far this season. Only West Brom has as many draws this season.

It's mathematically possible but I wouldn't get your hopes up. Nor, for that matter, should Man U.

NO ONE WILL EVER READ THIS EDIT: Man City won the title with exactly 86 points, with Everton ending up with 72: 12 W, 2 D, 7 L

It wasn't run in the same way as the foodbank model, I suppose because there were less of us in need, rather than go somewhere to get a food parcel the church would actually bring it to your door.

Bar the jobcentre being able to refer people, and the name change, it's the same system, the only difference is the media picks up on it now. As you say there was barely a peep of this layer of help back then in the go-go 90's when 'things could only get better'.

I find it bizarre that publicising aid agencies in the national press is seen as a negative/causative of the increase in food bank use.

I totally agree.  But this has nothing to do with fairy stories or religion, and certainly nothing to do with anyone trying to run a society by fairy story.  It's about M&amp;S accommodating their staff.  I don't care how sane or stupid the reasoning being it is: if someone can't or won't serve alcohol for whatever reason, then M&amp;S should try to accommodate them equally.  That's what they did. 

If they are prepared to employ a 17 year old and excuse them from selling alcohol them it's clearly something their business model can support.  In which case, it's no big deal to make the same exception for someone who choses not to handle alcohol for religious reasons (however irrational those reasons might appear to you and I).

Don't get me wrong, I totally believe in a secular society and think religion should play no part in defining the law of the land.  But I also believe in ""Live and let live"" and letting people have their silly beliefs if they want them.  If you can't stand the thought of M&amp;S being tolerant to those kind of beliefs then then don't give then your custom.

In times of economic hardship,  people always look for someone to blame, even if the target is blameless. And though we might blame bankers too for the mess we're in now, it's not bankers getting picked on. People always pick on a weaker group when they choose a victim.

&gt;The OP makes no attempt to understand why people might dislike immigrants in the slightest

Perhaps that's because it's incomprehensible to him. After all, what has he done to them?

So why do people dislike immigrants? Is there a good reason,  or is it based mainly on ignorance and prejudice?

&gt;No mention of the actual bad immigrants or bad people of Pakistani descent

Because he's not one of them,  maybe, so feels the hatred is undeserved.

The Sun on Sunday (most popular Sunday paper) has a circulation covering 1 in every 32.

Around 1 in 7 of the population buys a paper each day. If I make the assumption that everyone reads a newspaper every day, and scale the figures to match, The Sun reaches 1 in every 3.80 people, the Daily Mail reaches 1 in every 4.91, the Daily Mirror reaches 1 in every 8.64 people, and no other daily paper reaches 1 in 10 people. For Sunday papers, you get The Sun on Sunday reaching 1 in every 4.08, The Mail on Sunday reaching 1 in every 4.78, the Sunday Mirror reaching 1 in every 7.89 and The Sunday Times reaching 1 in every 9.26; no other Sunday paper reaches 1 in 10 people.

Looking at cumulative reach, to get 1 in 10 of the population, you need to get The Sun, the Daily Mail, the Daily Mirror, the Evening Standard and the Daily Telegraph on side. On the Sunday paper side, you need The Sun on Sunday, The Mail on Sunday, the Sunday Mirror, The Sunday Times, the Sunday Express and The Sunday Telegraph.

If you assume that everyone reads a paper, you only need get The Sun, the Daily Mail and the Daily Mirror on side to cover over 50% of the UK population; their Sunday counterparts do the same for Sundays.

If you like burgers, Atomic Burger on Cheltenham Road is excellent. Retro-themed restaurant with fantastic food!

The museum at the top of Park St is great. Lots of little exhibits, but good. 

Arnolfini is a great little gallery down by the harbour with a nice book shop and restaurant/bar attached. 

Just over the water is M-Shed, a fantastic museum with paid and free exhibitions. 

If you enjoy independent and old movies, you should see what's on at the Watershed. 

If you're into music, there are lots of free gigs around the city. Check out places like Start the Bus and Mr Wolf's. I'd recommend signing up to Songkick, too. With so many great venues about like Thekla and The Fleece, a band you love might be playing nearby!

Ashton Court is great for relaxing walks overlooking the city. Complete with deer. I went a few months back and the stags were teaching young stags how to fight! It was wonderful.

&gt;Here are some of the rights infringements that the ECHR has prevented in the UK:-
&gt;
&gt;    Requiring that when somebody is killed by the state there must be a proper independent investigation, and that armed personnel should be trained properly (McCann et al v UK)


&gt;    Preventing the government informing paramilitaries they know will kill someone of that individual's location, to execute by proxy (Shaghan v UK)


&gt;    You can't put an ethnic individual in a cell with a racist offender and take bets on how long he'll last (he died) (R on the application of Amin v SSHD)


&gt;    It led to safeguards and legal standards for wiretapping (Malone v UK) (Although it would appear not nearly enough...)


&gt;    You can't ""interrogate"" prisoners by forcing them into certain positions or depriving them of light and sound (Ireland v UK)


&gt;    The legalisation of homosexuality in Northern Ireland (Dudgeon v UK)


&gt;    Stopping contempt of court from infringing on freedom of the press (Sunday Times v UK)


&gt;    The mentally ill who voluntarily commit themselves to an institution are owed the same duty - suicide watch etc - as those who are sectioned (Rabone v Pennine Care)


&gt;    Ensuring that existing prisoners still get access to solicitors (Golder v UK)


&gt;    Ensuring that workers maintain rights to join trade unions (Wilson v UK)


&gt;    Giving the police an obligation to act if somebody is being dangerously stalked (Osman v UK)


&gt;    Preventing indefinite detention under the declaration of a national emergency (A v SOS for the Home Dept).


&gt;    Preventing public birching of children by the police in the Isle of Man (Tyrer v UK)


&gt;    If you're arrested and acquitted, the government cannot arbitrarily hold onto your DNA, which could never have been obtained were you not wrongly accused (S &amp; Marper vs UK)

Well that's because I said immigrants and not him specifically.

&gt;So why do immigrants dislike immigrants? Is there a good reason, or is it based mainly on ignorance and prejudice?

gonna assume that meant to say people for the first part. Mostly maintaining your culture and not have people try to change it to their liking, not having the issues when people clash in the process of integration(if they ever even do), not bringing in a bunch of people just because big businesses want it especially with high unemployment or youth unemployment and strained welfare programs, etc.

Nope, that's a strawman. My point was as a said, just because someone's getting blamed doesn't mean they're just a scapegoat as the Jews were.

&gt;Because he's not one of them, maybe, so feels the hatred is undeserved.

As I said, the view is only ""me me me"". He has a shared background with those people, whether he wants it or not.

The trouble is that polls show that these aren't small minorities.

&gt; 36% of 16 to 24-year-olds believe if a Muslim converts to another religion they should be **punished by death**, compared with 19% of over-55s

Muslims are become more radical.  And 36% is not a small number.  The same number again want to send their kids to an Islamic school and want to live under Sharia law.

But let's talk about the majority of Muslims:

74% of 16 to 24-year-olds would prefer Muslim women to choose to wear the veil, compared with only 28% of over-55s.

That's a huge shift in radicalization.

true,No1Reddit,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"For what its worth, my theory is that what you are experiencing is exactly what has been planned by both radical Muslims and British racists.  There was book written in 1992 'Jihad v. McWorld' (http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1992/03/jihad-vs-mcworld/303882/) which pretty much detailed what was going to happen (and what has/is happening).  In a nutshell, as the world gets more global people fear that they will get lost in it all and they react in a, well, reactionary way.  So some people (both White and Asian) see a Pakistanis living and integrating well in the UK and react but trying to undermine it.

Us 'white' British see a radicalised Muslim beheading a soldier in the streets and assume its the Muslims attacking us, but they aren't really, they don't really give a toss about us, what they are really trying to do is undermine people that are trying to integrate and just get on with their lives, and sadly, people like the EDL and the Daily Mail crowd are also afraid and they are falling into the trap and reacting exactly how the fundamentalist want them to.  The racists and the fundamentalists want to provoke a war, our job (as decent human beings) is to not let them.

I think you right and we really are turning backwards, but I also think that many of the set backs can be temporary.  At the end of the day, there are always people who want a fight, but most of us just want to get on and not hate each other.  I think you are right to say it, and I think as a country we have to have more faith in our liberal values and be less afraid that somehow Islam is going to send us hurtling back into the days of Oliver Cromwell and religious fundamentalism, but keep the faith and keep speaking our because you are right, this is your country too!

However, it has to be acknowledged that there were people I went to school with, who haven't worked ever.  In Cornwall this isn't unusual, but the odd thing is one person I knew, I thought he'd do better than that, but when I look at it closely, they have two children, and in many ways life a very different life to someone like me.  But when I'm being hit with something like SLC demanding over ten grand, for a one hundred pound bill, I do wonder why I play the game correctly, combine that with the fact the girl friend decides (thankfully) that this isn't the right time to have the baby and well, that sort of thing weighs on your mind a bit, even in your twenties you question if this is going to be the last opportunity.  In the future I'll still be working hard, I'm not the kind of guy who can give something half his attention.  But I think in terms of stress they don't have it that bad.

So you look back, you see someone spending all his time with the kids, thanks to fraudulently signing on disability (and bragging about it) the lifestyle afforded to him is really not bad.  Sure you can't easily compare the two.  Am I richer because I can stop work at 7pm and go have a meal someone else has cooked for me?  Does that provide a better quality of life than having all the time in the world?  Truth be told I am not sure I would move back the 200+ miles, I like London, but I also hate it.  The emotions make you compare it, even if objectively you know its flawed.

The problem is when people mention benefits and the like, and for me, I think they'd never help me.  I don't even know if they'd pay my mortgage if I lost all my income.  Hell I assume HSBC would be of more use.  So I become aware that they are of little use to me.

true,GreatZapper,null,null,"&gt; I was thinking to apply for a teaching assistance position in the UK inbetween my degrees, which would enable me to work in a British school for 6-10 months. Most likely I would assist German classes. 

I'm honestly not sure what you mean by this.  In the UK (state) system, teaching assistants assist the teacher with specific students - either due to learning needs (eg dyslexia or autism) or behaviour issues.  It's a poorly paid and pretty thankless task.  Although you would be working one-to-one with students, or with small groups, you can be allocated to any subject whatsoever.  You might end up in Maths or Science, for example.  In my experience, having a TA in a languages class is a rare luxury.  Most TAs are reasonably underqualified - A levels at best, often - and have no subject-specific skills.  A TA with a Masters would be very unusual.

Perhaps the sort of thing you're after would be an FLA, that I talked about before?  That would be specifically language focussed, but again, the pay is quite poor.

To get QTS, you need some sort of teaching qualification.  This could be gained in Germany and converted across (though check that this is allowed) or you could do a year on a PGCE course at a university, or do an in-school programme.  Whichever you choose, if you want to teach in a UK school, you'll need QTS.  Try http://www.education.gov.uk/get-into-teaching/teacher-training-options/itt-routes for more info and routes into the profession.

I appreciate your optimism about opportunities for German teachers in four or five years.  Unfortunately I find it difficult to share with you as I've seen just how much it is contracting.  Seven years ago 90% of my timetable was German.  Now it is just three lessons a week.  Granted, I've moved schools, but my experience is not untypical.

true,Turtle_Blues,null,null,"I feel for you, OP, and the experiences and attitudes you describe - then and now - make me cringe to be British. I have never understood the mistrust of or anger towards people based on their skin colour, or their cultural heritage. 

We are a post-imperial country. Yes, we did awful things and colonialism ranks highly on the scale of Things That Are Not Good Ideas, but it's also brought us undeniable cultural richness, and we should be embracing the result of that, because it's a part of our identity. All of our identities, no matter where our ancestors were born. 

I once dated a guy who lived in a predominantly non-white (largely Bangladeshi) area, and I got a lot of hostility for that. Not quite chasing down the street level, but the local population did not want me there. I knew people who were isolated, and who chose to isolate themselves, because the reality of integration was scary,and not what they expected. Our local postmaster was Bengali. Made a huge effort to assimilate, yet still freaked out when his wife wanted to learn English, learn to drive, and get a job outside the home as their kids grew up. At that time (mid-90s), as far as I knew, there was less racism from whites towards Asians (excepting a few people whom everyone else thought were backward idiots anyway) than there was lingering mistrust from the Asian community for the way they'd been treated in previous decades. Second and third generation Indian and Pakistani kids I knew didn't seem to care much, and - as you say - everything felt so much more accepting than it does now. 

I do think the media is to blame, and there is certainly a fair amount of recycling old bigotry with ""Muslim"" in place of a straight-up racial slur. It serves political ends, it sells papers (I imagine), and it's disgusting. Also, as /u/RassimoFlom pointed out, it's dangerous, because the displacement and rejection people feel is polarising, and it feeds into the feelings that radicalism (by which I mean both religious radicalism, and EDL/BNP membership) plays upon; it makes it an ""us vs. them"" situation, even though that mentality is blatantly bullshit. 

Just as radical Islam is not representative of Islam as a whole, the EDL/BNP/UKIP brigade are not representative of the rest of the country... though I think they are a sizeable and terrifying minority. I also suspect a lot of white people who live - as I do now - in very white areas (I'm down in Cornwall. It's not very diverse.), genuinely don't know what it can be like, and genuinely don't believe things are ""that bad"". It's ignorance, plain and simple, and a lot of the rhetoric being thrown around comes - as others have said - from the fear generated, not just by the upswing of panic around terrorism in the past decade, but also the crap economic climate. 

I have a medical condition that means I can't work a conventional job. I'm therefore on benefit. I feel like the dregs of society because of this, as every communication with the DWP - not to mention the front pages of all those shitty tabloid newspapers I don't bother reading - reminds me. I also apparently look Polish or Czech or something (goodness knows why, as - excepting a teensy bit of Romani and some Bengali connections waaaaay back - my family didn't move from a twenty mile square area for about four hundred years. Yes, they were a bit country.), because I get verbal abuse for being ""a bloody immigrant"" every so often. My point is that this insular, frightened, ignorant thinking is just that: responses from small, scared minds. 

To echo what other comments here have said, the way to fight that is outreach. Little things. Be open and friendly with the people you have deal with, day after day after day, maybe get involved in some kind of community project if you have the time, or consider starting a blog to help more people understand what your experiences have been like.... but never, ever let the bigots win by letting them convince you that you don't belong, or that you are ""other"".

I've also been watching Coutinho closely (because I believe he's being overrated at the moment). While his general play is good and he keeps the ball well, his final ball has been off all season. 

His goal against Everton was practically on the goal line already. What frustrates me the most is the amount of shots he takes from outside the box. These are all almost exclusively wide of the post, over the bar, or straight at the 'keeper. He does the same thing several times per game and it just kills off a good move. I was at the game on Saturday and it was incredibly frustrating to see promising chances being thrown away. His final ball into the box has also been off since he came back from injury, with through balls being over hit etc. I don't mind this quite as much (at least he is trying to create something), but combined with his poor shooting, I can see why people are getting frustrated (I am one of them).

The anti-Islam bigots and Islam-for-everybody bigots can never tolerate each other because they are by definition intolerant. The only difference is proportion: You know a hell of a lot about Britain because you're part of it, but it's easy for most people to learn little about your lifestyle, beliefs or heritage (including how much of it you share with the rest of the country) because you're a minority.

The upshot of that is it's obvious to all that Nick Griffin is not really speaking for Britain, but when the same breed of morons put words in *your* mouth people don't have the context to easily identify them as atypical. People mostly aren't falling for the racist/anti-Islamic hate messages, they just can't tell tolerant vaguely-Muslim-looking people apart from extremist Muslim hate groups.

You threw out a load of questions, and then addressed them by cherry picking answers or simply opting for plain invention.

&gt;What exactly makes this other country/nation/race backwards? Is it treatment of women? 

Oddly, you completely neglected to comment on this one at all.  Perhaps because you couldn't find a convenient way to make our country sound just as bad?

&gt;If it's standard of dress, what makes ours any better? We see people walking around with barely anything on in the middle of winter. We have people who'll happily walk around with jeans practically around their ankles.

And yet, ironically, you left out the most clear differentiator between the UK and strictly Islamic countries.  The fact that someone can, if they choose, wear barely anything in the middle of winter, or dress like a douche because they have (within reason) the right to choose to dress however they want.  Something that can't be said for women living under a strict Islamic code.

&gt;If it's language, then why is ours ""better""? Because you can communicate better in English than, say, Urdu? Replace Urdu with German, or something like that. Still think that it's a backwards language?

This is a bizarre comment.  In the 40-something years I've been on this earth, I have yet to hear someone describe another country as being backward because they use a different language.  People might imitate non-British who speak English because they have a ""funny"" accent, but the language itself is rarely even addressed.

&gt;I have a pile of leaflets here from just the local area, complaining about greenbelt land being used for houses, when we have significant areas of derelict buildings

Christ what a nightmare.  That's clearly every bit as bad as being stoned to death for being a woman alone in a car with a man.  Or being gang-raped and then executed because you were ""promiscuous"".   How does not even legally being allowed to drive a car because you're woman grab you?   Heaven forbid you might want to be openly gay.

People think of things as backward, because they're backward.  Not all muslims are backward and not everyone living in Islamic countries are backward.  Unfortunately however, some of those countries *do* have laws and codes that we justifiably would consider backward, because they're abhorrent, cruel, repressive in ways we don't even come close to, and trying to pretend otherwise is as ignorant as condemning every individual muslim (or non-white, non-Brit for that).",0,1387798756,null,0,1387804355,0,ce8f15j,t3_1tiaka,t1_ce8f15j,t1_ce8ef8b,null,1428017353,18,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,18

I fully understand it; people are worse off, angry, and don't know who to blame - so it's been targeted at the easy demographics. It's disgusting. There's no respect for people who get on with their lives, for people who came here *to be British*, and even for people who were bloody born in this country but aren't Anglo saxon. We've been a country of mixed populations our entire existence. Our Kingdom is based on a unity of nations. Where the fuck has that gone? It feels like the Scottish quest for secession is a reflection of this - we're not one, together any more; we're all about being our own little microcosms. 

I think that a big culprit for this is the inability of the public to appropriately express and convey the legitimate issues that can occur with immigrants. Is Pakistan a country with a radically different culture to ours? Yes. Does it have problems with corruption, womens rights and so on? Yes. Is it ok to say so? Absolutely. Is it ok to then pin that on a Brit of Pakistani extraction? Absolutely not! 

I think we have dropped the ball on immigration a bit, not by being too lax but by not emphasising the significance of our own social and cultural attitudes and how these are largely adopted by people coming to this country and being insufficiently targeted in our criticisms of when they aren't. See my qualifier of 'western views on human rights' at the start. That's absolutely fine to use, because I'd say the same of anyone, and you would too - for example, the idiots of the BNP are firmly in the wrong for their prehistoric views. 

Sadly, as a result of this, sun and daily mail readers everywhere see the minority cases, feel as if there's being forced to tolerate them, and then associate that forced powerlessness with the 'issue' of immigration as a whole.

I also didn't rewatch it and forgot it even mentioned that. I felt the important point was obvious though, *given the context of your thread*. 

I don't think they falsely state, it is normally easy to find the accounts of most charities, just google their annual reports. 

And many publish statistics like 

&gt; For every ¬£1 donated to Oxfam, 84p goes directly to emergency, development and campaigning work. Just 9p is spent on running costs

216k a year would be a lot, unfortunately I will need a source on it. I say this because there was a news article recently that talked about the 30 highest paid people working for charities getting ""over 100k"" and I cant imagine the spread is that big.

However, it all comes down to the value of the individual and the value of alternatives. (If choosing someone who will accept 10k less only leads to a 5k drop in revenue, go for it). And that isn't an overall comment about employed people in charities, just a comment on how they decide.

Assuming you are right, if that 216k brings in 5 million for the charity they wouldn't have. Then I am okay with it. However, that is above my level and I can't comment on whether it is a net gain or not.

true,DaveyC,null,null,"&gt;If you're worried about 10 people with leaflets why aren't you wetting yourself at the prospect of thousands of far right supports in the EDL and the like? Why isn't that something to be worried about - considering the EDL have been boasting about active recruitment in the military and the like?

The EDL are an annoyance to most white people. Though, they aren't trying to impose anything on white British people. They're a bunch of football hooligans and thugs who haven't set their sites on the white person's way of life...at least not yet.

Many of those in radical Islam **do** want to change things for white British people. They want to behead those who criticise, or heaven forbid, draw a picture of Muhammad. They want to censor art because it has ladies' breasts in it. They want to ban alcohol. They want to ban pork. They want to execute homosexuals and make women dress according to their arbitrary rules. They want to force the whole country to become Muslim and force you to have your penis circumsized. To many, Islam appears to be trying to take away freedoms. The media helps perpetuate this meta-narrative because it sells Newspapers (or advertising online). Divide and conquer etc!

The cynical answer is, white British people aren't scared of the EDL because the EDL is a minority group that isn't after them and doesn't want to stop them getting pissed and doesn't want to cut their willies.

Edit: Also, most of the people commenting on these stories of Muslims doing stupid stuff aren't event British. There are tons of Americans who, for some reason, are very heavily invested in spreading the idea that Britain is becoming a Muslim country and that is should serve as a warning to Americans.

&gt; There's no respect for people who get on with their lives, for people who came here *to be British*, and even for people who were bloody born in this country but aren't Anglo saxon. We've been a country of mixed populations our entire existence. Our Kingdom is based on a unity of nations. Where the fuck has that gone? It feels like the Scottish quest for secession is a reflection of this - we're not one, together any more; we're all about being our own little microcosms. 

Yes, there was a time I'm sure when we understood we were a collection of groups with different backgrounds and histories but with something in common too. And the differences didn't really matter.

I'd go further now and say that I don't mind if someone wants to self-identify as French or Italian or Iranian and not British, provided we can get along. In my view, it doesn't matter where you're from. What's important is where you are now and what you do while you're here.

&gt;I think that a big culprit for this is the inability of the public to appropriately express and convey the legitimate issues that can occur with immigrants. Is Pakistan a country with a radically different culture to ours? Yes. Does it have problems with corruption, womens rights and so on? Yes. Is it ok to say so? Absolutely. Is it ok to then pin that on a Brit of Pakistani extraction? Absolutely not!

Well there are legitimate concerns about how quickly immigrants can be absorbed into a society, because if they can't integrate, that's when you have ghettos and isolated little communities, little islands within an island that don't talk to reach other. But all too often a debate on such issues drops into the same send-them-all-back rut instead of properly exploring the problems.

Equally, criticisms of cultural habits from the motherland that don't fit are branded racist too easily, or are presented as ""probably racist now"" by a passive-aggressive press.

&gt;Sadly, as a result of this, sun and daily mail readers everywhere see the minority cases, feel as if there's being forced to tolerate them, and then associate that forced powerlessness with the 'issue' of immigration as a whole.

Yes, it's not a fine-grained and nuanced debate. And things that happen the majority of the time are, almost by definition, not news. It's the rare and unlikely events that get reported, and then people assume it's a national trend.

but that's the exact point, atheists (and I count myself as an atheist) don't. Nationalism, patriotism, traditionalism even atheism isn't any more real than theism. 

the belief is real: the belief has an effect, people do believe in god, do believe their country is better etc. These are equals on the level of validity, in fact in some ways theism is **less** of a believe, for at least it can be proved. Nationalism and patriotism etc. are evidently false. There's no intrinsic value to nation, nations are lines drawn on maps, and geographical space has no intrinsic value. In fact the very notion of a nation is false, it is meaningless and illusory. Attempting to unite people around an illusion, because people share the same vague geographical area and because they (approximately) speak the same language, doesn't mean there are some concrete relations, some shared values etc. between the two. Why do people living in Dover not view the French 23 miles south as part of their nation, whilst viewing those 23 miles north as. Why should I care more about these people than others? I have never met them, yet through the nation we claim to know them. In fact all studies have suggested that we have most things in common with people of our age range and our social status, independent of nation (i.e. teenagers, British and French, have more in common than a British pensioner and a British teenager). 

It's sad when atheists, claiming to be always criticising, completely rational, fail to do the most basic criticisms of those essential trans-historical notions. We must critique there role and function.

true,rev9of8,null,null,"I get mid-rate care for DLA and low-rate mobility along with ESA in the support group and the Disability Income Guarantee (bipolar disorder and an autistic spectrum disorder). 

My cash in hand benefits are approx. ¬£196 per week which means I get fractionally under ¬£10k per year. 

Rent is covered by Housing Benefit but as I'm in supported accommodation run by a private landlord and I'm under thirty-five I only qualify for ¬£80.80 housing benefit per week which is the Local Housing Allowance single room rate for Edinburgh &amp; the Lothians (if I was over thirty-five it would be about ¬£115 per week for rent allowance for a one bedroom flat).

So total benefits come to around an equivalent ¬£13.5k per year which would be equivalent to a pre-tax income of, at most, ¬£16k. Given that I was earning about a grand a week after tax in my last job, it's a hell of a drop although you can live on it.

I've been offered a one bedroom flat by a housing association that I'm due to move into in the new year. As it's social housing, the LHA restriction which would mean I would only qualify for the single-room rate due to my age doesn't apply and I'll get my full rent of about ¬£310 per month covered (private flats in the building rent for almost double that and are unaffordable to those on housing benefit).

I do have to pay ¬£63 per week out of my benefits to cover the service charge for my supported accommodation though. 

However, someone on JSA who is under twenty-five, or even under thirty-five, is essentially fucked. Hard. By a rusty chainsaw. 

And if you're in private accommodation you're screwed as the LHA rates are at least a hundred quid per month too low for where I am since they changed the rules so that LHA only pays out up to the thirtieth percentile of market rates for your area. 

Median rents where I am are six hundred pounds per month for a one bedroom flat but LHA only pays up to ¬£495 per month.

Gary McAllister's unbelievable season when we won the Uefa Cup-Fa Cup-League Cup Treble in 2001. Including this game/last minute Gary Mac contribution     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibOqzB_kbRA

John Arne Riise doing this to the Mancs: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx8tMiaNawI

Our game in Anfield in 04 against Olympiakos, after conceding to a free kick we need to score 3 (win by 2 clear goals) to go through. A fairly unsung hero was Sinama-Pongolle who came on at half time and played a blinder &amp; scored in the process. Then after having 2 disallowed goals in the game we were 2-1 up with a few minutes remaining and Gerrard produced one of the moments of his career.  

There's some highlights here but you could probably find better: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlVisYzTDb8

Luis Garcia and his contribution to our European cup winning season, his goal against Juventus and that game in general. We were underdogs pretty much all that season.

Gerrard winning the FA Cup against West Ham in the last minute

Immigration, even unskilled, especially if required, contributes far more. It gives steady income, improves most parts of market and does not leave empty properties.

The [press release](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/help-to-buy-puts-new-generation-of-home-owners-on-housing-ladder) published at the same time includes a lot more info, including your shocking 'reveal' that only 10 of the offers had completed.

'Child Poverty climbed under Labour (Iain Duncan Smith)' - this is the kind of thing that should be in the 10% you leave on the list. Everything IDS said was technically correct, but it's the definition of a disingenuous statement. Only in the exact context and using his specific figures is it true. By any reasonable interpretation of the stats it fell under Labour.

I work in IT sales, and in my Industry you can go and chose whatever Job you want if you speak a relevant language. (sorry if there was a misunderstanding). I speak English.

Companies are desperate for people speaking languages, and especially in French and German there is a high demand. Students need to understand this when they do their degrees, it can make all the difference. Finance and German was quite popular in my Uni, if I remember correctly. I had a job one week after signing up with a recruitment agency, and others who are looking for similar roles with similar qualification had no trouble either. I get offers every day via LinkedIn etc, and that's not because of experience (I've only been working in the sector for 1 1/2 years now).

I'd say that my 1st hiring was 100% due to my language skills. And the other guy in my team would say the same, and he was hired for French (he's not a native speaker but is fluent).

Especially in jobs such as sales, Account management etc, no one cares what you studied, it's more about how you can transfer the skills you learned, so languages will massively tip the scales in your favour, and mean you get to work in a company with international ties, which is great experience, and normally comes with a sweet benefit package.",0,1387805208,null,0,false,0,ce8g1my,t3_1tgfjy,t1_ce8g1my,t1_ce891nz,null,1428016880,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

true,lbspredh,null,null,"&gt;And that is a very wrong approach. Why? Because allowing only rich people to come to this country, who buy properties, means that now probably half of central London is now owned by rich oil oligarchs who don't always invest any monies into UK (besides buying property and doing once a year shopping in Harrod

they spend buttloads of money when they are here, and take nothing they haven't paid a big chunk of money for when the come home, and for that reason I say they are a good thing to have.

&gt;Immigration, even unskilled, especially if required, contributes far more. It gives steady income, improves most parts of market and does not leave empty properties.

immigration of people with no money and no skills contributes nothing other than the job itself, but we have enough people to do those jobs anyway

&gt;UK is rich. If you are rich you get lazy. If you get lazy you want other people to work for you and then you get fat. That's why USA, UK and Saudi Arabia have highest percentage of fat people.

majority of people in this country are not remotely lazy, and there are people out there willing to do any job but there are not enough jobs to go around as is.

&gt;You also can't just rise wages for unskilled jobs. Why? Would you be willing to work for ¬£15 p/h doing highly skilled and responsible job at a time where you can earn as much putting bread on shelves in Tesco? Increase in wages would have to be for all as otherwise people wouldn't be bothered learning any skills as what's the point if they earn the same having none?

hyperbole, 7.50-8.50 an hour is a decent enough minimum wage and it doesnt cause the problem you just outlined, dont know why everyone skips right up to 15 unless they want to make a point.

&gt;If you increase all wages then it leaves you in exactly same situation as you are now (actually, worse one as financial difficulties would probably be huge).
I admit that some people earn too much but there will always be a gap between different jobs. So either local people stop complaining and do them or get immigrants who would do that work. Otherwise you collapse all parts of economy, which rely on such unskilled jobs

I agree, but they don't have to increase a thing, all i want is for us to not actively do things which lower the average wage, for example allowing and inviting uncontrolled immigration from the poorer parts of the EU.

true,Snoron,cnty-england,Bradford,"But the thing is that they really *don't* mean you. What they don't realise is that they don't mean a hell of a lot more other people than they think they do, too.

The problem that really exists is that they don't have any sort of grasp on the number of people they *do* mean. So there are people who are Muslims that they do have a problem with, and there are ones they don't - but what's the split? 1% and 99%? 10 and 90? 50 and 50? and 99% and 1%?

More than anything it just comes down to a psychological bias where a) you are focusing on the most vocal, most outspoken, most outrageous acts, because you  don't hear about the 100,000s of Muslims working a 9-5 and then drinking tea while watching Coronation Street in the papers every day - so this becomes indicative of that group. And b) is that ""Muslim"" gets attached to the bad things people do because they claim to do it in the name of that religion. Which is really bad PR to say the least.

But it's hard to separate these things without a group name. We do need to group people together for our own sake, too. Unfortunately Muslim/Islam has just become the banner of convenience for everyone to group these people together. If there was another separate name for them, ie. if they were part of a specific group with leadership or common specific set of beliefs, then it would not be quite the same.

You brought up the situation in Ireland elsewhere. The reason we don't group them all just as ""Catholics"" or ""Protestants"" is because there are other characteristics that are well known to the general public that lets us give a communal name to them and differentiate between them and other people of the same religion. For a start they're all Irish - that's an easy one! And then when you can just call a group ""the IRA"" then it's simple again - you're with them or you're not. And again this is a distinction that people do understand.

Now back to Islam - it's difficult. And it's annoying because it really *is* just semantics, but our perceptions are limited by these things. Who are these terrorists? Why are these specific people murdering? Well, they can come from *any* country or background for a start. They can be from Kenya or Pakistan or Britain. What do they call themselves? Muslims - they say they follow Islam, and they claim that this is why they are doing what they do. And of course they will do a lot of the things that all other Muslims do. They will often even dress in a way that a lot of other Muslims happen to dress. And when they use this belief as a justification to kill people, enact Sharia on the streets of London, etc. etc. etc. it is not easy to separate them when we don't have an applicable term in our vocabulary.

So where does a differentiation come from in the publics mind? We haven't been fed names of groups or races or specific religious sects by the media when they report these things. So we can't say ""Oh those bloody ______ _____!"" It's Muslims. Now I dunno if this is purposeful, targeted, or just plain laziness, or possibly even just an unintended consequence as I mentioned of it being kinda difficult TO give a name to them especially when they already give a name to themselves which is unfortunately wide. I suspect it is mainly this and laziness, but then it's not easy.

If we had a word, then due to all the similarities and difficulties in classifying based on country or race or style of dress, you can end up falling into the trap where Muslims all end up being called by this new name too.

As an example: It's a shame really that a term like Al'Qaeda didn't do more to enter our vocabulary and describe these sorts of people. And not just for us to call them that, but also for them to claim it themselves. If this was the case then you would get an instant separation. Those people at the office could just say ""God damn you know the problem with these Al'Qaeda people..."" and you wouldn't even enter into the conversation.

So as far as I'm aware, there's your problem - the solution is not simple, though. Unfortunately without cooperation from all of the people doing things in the name of Islam, or from the general public and the media getting their shit together, a solution from the wider Islamic community could be possible but really freaking difficult and the best way I have considered this could be done is something that the majority of Muslims are not willing to do for religious reasons.

But you are right to be frustrated - but do keep in mind that it is only a human failing that allows this to happen. People don't have these views out of malice or hatred towards what you or other people are, but only what they think they are.

Maybe see if you can think of a good and succinct way to explain this to people, even, help one drop at a time. Maybe one of the simplest things but unfortunately probably not very effective, is something about the lines of ""those people are not Muslims anyway"". Ie. drawing the line between people who call themselves a Muslim and are, and those that do but do entirely un-Islamic things. That way when someone uses their brain for half a second to think about a group of Muslims they see on the streets, they will realise that chances are they are the sort of people like you, not the sort of people plotting their destruction.

Maybe we need to organise a survey of Muslims to ask all the pertinent questions and display it to people in the form of graphs and pie charts. It would be interesting and would advance discussion and give some backbone to arguments of what the current population ""Muslims"" do and don't think and want.",0,1387806232,null,0,false,0,ce8g8z3,t3_1tiaka,t1_ce8g8z3,t1_ce8ekwm,null,1428016784,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

There is absolutely **no** legitimate reason that well known services like Childline, or the Samaritans should even be an option to block if this is all about protecting our youth? It's not just abuse images they're blocking here, it's legitimate help they are preventing any potential victims from accessing with a very easy one-click system.

Example: The 12 filter blocks the Samaritans website. ( I've contacted 02 to suggest reviewing such classifications, but that's just pissing into the wind with companies like this. )

Rant ahead: I personally think the whole Opt-Out ""Web filter"" thing is bullshit anyway, an easily circumventable, impractical mess due to my personal concerns about mission creep occurring.. 

But given that this is a move that is being sold as to *protecting children*, why on earth are services like this that children would use being blocked, or even able to be blocked?

It's a horrible factor that they have to face if they want to set up these kind of ""Protectionisms"", that there are people who will need access to services and help like this. Having an easy to configure opt-out filter that only the bill payer or account holder can change, that allows you to block access to help sites.. 

Such a way to aid in controlling the information a minor can access is a discomforting thought. That is the other side of the coin that they have not addressed with this ridiculous idea.

The worst part is it's not just kids.. even adult abuse victims are going to be caught in this. It's not all about the kids.. Adults get abused and controlled too.

you started with the ""you know nothing"" insult slinging, i'd say the same to you. what facts did you point out, I answered the ones about transfer and exchange fees, I said they only take a small amount of the money transferred/exchanged, and I also answered your point about exchanging pounds leading them back here by saying it devalues our currency. So what have I missed?

&gt;I'm also quite sure you don't have all the facts regarding sending money abroad and what impact it has on economy. For example, how much do you think it can be possibly sent if someone lives in UK? 80% of wages? NO! If something only 20%. In any case I bet it's better to have pounds spent in Eurozone, rather than outside of EU... and by that we get to a discussion regarding immigration from outside of EU, which politicians don't want to talk about.

now hold on don't go taking what I said out of context here, all I said was that it had an impact which these figures did not consider, not that it was the end of the world or the biggest expense ever, it's best to have pounds spent in the UK, and I don't see why we should feel differently about outside of EU immigration. 

also 20% is a lot of money we don't need to be losing, it's an expense we can ditch by being a little more selective

I've noted that the problem persists generally on reddit and this subreddit quite a lot in regards to the Muslim religion. The problem is that these people are seeking answers but lack the historical knowledge to find the right ones.  
When I answer a question like: ""why did this terrorist bombing happen"" I can point to many pieces of political upheaval over the past century in the respective countries of origin. The revenge makes a twisted sense but a sense it makes. I've got a cursory understanding of Islamic history but to others not grounded in this history they reach for the religion: ""oh this only happens in Muslim countries"", ""it's the religion"".

I've had people on _this_ subreddit try to convince me that progress is possible with Christianity but not with Islam. The amount of absurdity frightens me.

I have no idea what I can presently do beyond giving my often given history lessons on reddit trying to allow people to understand that its political upheaval and not religion that is behind terrorists acts performed in the name of religion. Any ideas for what more I can do?

Because a lot of people have little sympathy for human rights when the person concerned has no regard for human rights.

&gt;The problem therein is the fact that used nuclear fuel is mostly unused, unfissioned uranium 238; for the most part, uranium 235 is the only part of the original fuel that actually undergoes fission. but it is not like we can process out the unused 238 from the used fuel; that would be prohibitively expensive, not to mention dangerous with the existance of the quite radioactive fission products that resulted from the fissioning of uranium 235.

Nuclear stockpiles are *already* used to make up for the shortfall in uranium mine production.

As for thorium: until you can definitely prove that there is sufficient thorium supply in sufficiently stable regions making the investment into that technology is a poor idea. Right now there is no significant market for the stuff and we have no idea what pricing point it will come out at or what the commercially viable reserves are.

Simply put, i'm sure nuclear power is safe, its just an economically viable solution when you consider the timeframe of the plants and the cost of building them.

We should allow people who dislike particular brands due to problems with the business practices to refuse to sell items from that brand? The premise is absurd and is rife to be abused. If you work in a supermarket you should be expected to serve customers the products they have chosen.

What even is the person expecting to accomplish? Someone else will just sell it to them. They would still be funding an company that sells products they morally oppose. If it would bother someone that much, either get off the tills entirely and don't stack shelves in the meat and alcohol area (perhaps some employers would allow this) or don't work there.

Since I think others would benefit from my experience, I am happy to share:

I have been in sales for 1 1/2 years now. Prior to that I was looking for work in translation etc but found it to be a bit pointless, as everyone needs work done, but no one wants to pay for it.

I was contacted by a company called Pareto Law, who recruit for sales positions, especially for graduate positions. They will do assessments etc and then present you with some final stage interview options once you passed. I chose IT sector because I like technology, but there are many other options such as finance, pharma etc anything you can think of really.

I have beenin that job for a year, and starting salary was 21k plus bonus. Average starting wage is 18k-21k plus bonus, normally uncapped.
Language knowledge means that you can expect more towards the 21k.

Working for an international company meant: dealing with prospects all over DACH (deutschland √∂sterreich schweiz) and a bit of eastern europe. This would be done via email and phone. In this job I did lots of cold calling, but it was for a serious company, so you'd work closely with marketing on targeted campaigns. 

In my current job I work with inbound requests and do consulting as well as selling, which is nice.

I'm not using German anymore, but I don't care that much. I could go back to using it if I wanted, starting for another company. We're currently in short supply, so I'm spoiled for choice. Quite happy where I am though so not looking to move.

What I like: I get to talk to and help a lot of people and their projects.
I get to travel a lot, meet people face to face.
Pay is good. I now make much more than I did when I started and It's only been a year and a half. Also have good prospects to move up.

What I don't like: If it's great, it's the best job, but every now and then you have to deal with unsavoury individuals who forgot thei good upbringing. But every good customer makes up for 10 bad ones (and there aren't that many, I promise)

If you read past the headline, it was obvious that this wasn't just a decision made to benefit Muslims, it was something they did to be sensitive to all of their employees beliefs (religious or not).

EU immigration contributed to economy and that is a fact. That ""uncontrolled mass migration"" was a total of 1.5% of UK population. It's quite a lot but it's not as much as some describe it.

UK is part of EU and it needs to obey some laws but at the same time enjoy things which EU brings to it []http://www.the-eu-and-me.org.uk/](http://www.the-eu-and-me.org.uk/). Unless UK leaves EU, it can only control immigration from outside of EU - which it already can - BUT at the same time more non-EU immigrants came to UK than from within EU.

It's basically speaking, that UK can't just pick things which suit them the best - or rather suit current agendas. Check this [site](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/unemployment-rate) showing historical unemployment figures in UK. In 1984 it was 12%, in 1993 11%. It was around 5% from 2000 to 2009. EU extended in 2004, meaning that only after 5 years of having free migrant move within EU UK increased its unemployment meaning NOT immigrants where its fault but global crisis which started in 2007-2008, bankrupting thousands of employers and increasing unemployment.

P.S. [Unemployment rate in EU](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php?title=File:Unemployment_rate_by_gender_and_age,_2007-2012_(%25).png&amp;filetimestamp=20130417134058) - UK even in crisis has one of the lowest unemployment figures in EU and even in world. There is a global crisis which is responsible for higher unemployment figures. Not fucking immigrants, like Cameron and Farage suggest and think if they stop them they will solve all country's problems.

Actually that means everything. That and of course access to supply. Why do you think the French have so many troops in West Africa?

The problem is you are basing long term assumptions on current supply. And you're not even basing that on commercially viable supply.

&gt;Seawater extraction or modification of reactors to use thorium (which is three times more abundant than uranium) would absolutely not be economically viable at current uranium prices, but they would probably become viable at a price that did not make nuclear fission using thermal reactors uneconomic.

First off seawater extraction is not economically viable.

Secondly, physical abundance does not equal commercial abundance. Aluminium is extraordinarily abundant in the earths crust, but the only commercially viable aluminium containing mineral is bauxite.

Equally I think his job is similar to Henderson's in some ways - to pull the defenders out of position so Suarez has more space. Obviously he also has the job of trying to feed in the other players, but I've noticed he does often make darting runs off a pass to drag a defender away, and while that doesn't get him a goal or assist, it's key in allowing Suarez enough time and space to score the goals that he does.",0,1387809827,null,0,false,0,ce8h4fd,t3_1tit8y,t1_ce8h4fd,t3_1tit8y,null,1428016378,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

&gt;I'd like to see a more concentrated effort on his part to mesh into BR's tactical style once he returns. With Gerrard on the pitch, it looks like he is the only one not on the same page as everyone as far as tempo and direction are concerned.

This is true in a lot of ways. You're right in that a lot of it is to do with age, both physically and mentally. He's played a certain way his whole life and changing your game all of a sudden is a difficult thing to accomplish. You do what you're used to and what's been successful for you in the past. Gerrard is the only player who will still try and force it. Even Suarez has moved on from doing that. I don't have the stats at hand but I'd bet out of our midfield he's the most guilty of losing possession. He's not nearly dynamic or quick enough to be playing in the middle anymore, especially if we're going to implement the style of play we've been seeing since he's been out.

And I don't follow the ""other players don't have to play well with him on the pitch"" logic. When Gerrard was a talisman, he brought the level of everyone around him up. This is what Suarez does now. Players play a little quicker and are more willing to try a more confident brand of play (two Hendo back heel set ups?

On the whole, except for some specific areas, people don't hate anyone based on the colour of their skin or their religion, etc.  I genuinely believe that we are one of the least at-heart racist countries there is.  Europe has actual racism as does (as we of course know) America.

The problem is the media needs to create stories, and rather than treating negative things as things becoming of the individual people that did them or caused them, they use genralised terms which subconsciously attach the people to the negations in people's heads and twist their thoughts into resentment.

My point really is that it would be the same of any minority if the media focused on it; ginger people, fat people, white people, amish people, eskimos, etc.  People seem to need something to focus on and the media facilitate that and provide that focus in the way they think will provide them with the most sales - it's pretty disgusting but the fact is it's not people being at heart racist or hate people because they were born a certain colour or brought up with a certain religion.

They have an accent. They'll either polish it over the course of their lifespans or they wont. If they don't then people will have difficulty understanding them and they will have some issues integrating. People will from the second they speak identify them as non-native.  

&gt; What about second generation immigrants who speak a regional dialect common among persons of specific racial background?

I'm not sure I get you. Peepul from souf landan sand like der from souf landan. Ya darnt ave a black souf landan and a white souf landan. Its just one fur boaf races.

&gt; What about expats raised abroad but who nonetheless have British nationality and stronger or equally strong cultural and family ties with Britain than they place of birth? 

Well that's the trade off of being raised abroad, you're going to sound non-native.

I don't see any of this as ugly as someone that has befriended 1st and 2nd/3rd/4th generation people within the UK as well as natives I don't see our judgement on accent as an inherently evil thing. If anything it levels the playing field after one generation as we judge more on voice than colour of skin.

&gt;Congestion causes pollution and costs areas millions (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/transport/9734126/Trafiic-congestion-costs-UK-economy-4.3bn-a-year.html).

I fail to see how moving cars out of town centres is going to remove overall congestion. Most traffic does not occur on town high streets.

And 40% of that cost is from London.

And ¬£2.7 billion is peanuts in comparison to the benefits of the automotive industry.

&gt; Time to change.

We are changing. Cars are being better designed, and infrastructure is being improved.

Slow and inconvenient bikes are not the way forward.

The same writing style you see in the current affairs sections spills over in to those as well.   I am old enough to, just, remember Eddie 'The Eagle' Edwards and the 1988 winter Olympics. 

He was going to bring home the gold, show the world the true Brit spirit in the face of adversity. He was going to put all those other dirty little foreigners in their place.  At least if you believed the Mail, Express and usual assortment of suspects. 

Eddie Edwards did not have a hope in hell of getting a medal.  He had neither the equipment, training nor experience of competing at an international level, him coming absolute dead last in the event was a forgone conclusion for anyone with a passing interest in the how the Olympics work and how hard an Olympian has to train. 

As you'd expect the tabloids tore in to him with gusto, even to the point of insinuations he'd deliberately failed.  You can see the same sequence repeat every year with the England cricket team as well.

If Muslims were white, actually, I think you'd see much more criticism of their beliefs than there is already. Imagine the reaction if there were a group of white British who were as literalist in their beliefs about the Bible as Muslims are about the Koran, or who disliked gay people as much as Muslims do, or who supported sexist treatment of women like Muslims do. Frankly, I think your skin color kind of gives you a pass for bad behavior, which we wouldn't extend to white British people. In a way, that's a kind of racism.

Can you imagine a film like *Life of Brian* being made about Muhammed?  Christians get the kind of direct criticism and mockery that everyone's afraid to give to Muslims.

true,TheScarletPimpernel,null,null,"To answer your questions about the squad:

Coates's injury? Not that bummed. I imagine he wouldn't be a Liverpool player any more apart from that, he wasn't getting any game time and whilst I think he could have fitted into Rodgers's system, his development was stuttering at best and he'd now be our 5th choice CB, which is not something he wants either.

Quick run down on the rest of the squad, position by position (should be said, this is my own personal opinion, not gospel):

**Goalkeepers:**

Simon Mignolet: Far and away our best keeper. His shot stopping and handling is excellent, his command of the area is a breath of fresh air and his confidence if not overall competence with the ball is improving all the time. He might not have the distribution skills of Reina but he is a marked upgrade on Reina's last three seasons or so.

Brad Jones: Whilst he wears the No.1 shirt he isn't close to being our No.1. Got some game time last year when Reina was injured but his form was spotty at best and it is clear he is not a top keeper. However, he is a functioning No.2 and has amazing hair.

**Fullbacks:**

Glen Johnson: England's RB and arguably the best RB in the league on top form, he is a dazzling attacker and a solid defender, with the ability to score fabulous long range goals. Going through a sticky patch of form at the minute, and with his high-wage contract having only 18 months left to run, likely to move on in the summer.

Jose Enrique: Varies from the exceptional to the useless in the blink of an eye. Has the physical and technical attributes to be a world class defender but not the brain. Needed a kick up the arse to improve his form and hopefully Flanagan is doing just that.

Martin Kelly: I have very, very high hopes for Kelly, he could be a dazzlingly effective player but he cannot stay fit. Supposedly a CB more than a RB, but he can be one of the best in the league down that RHS when the mood takes him (as it often does). One of the best crossers of the ball whilst moving at speed in the league, for me. When he slows down to do so, is where it starts going astray.

Aly Cissohko: Brought in on loan in the summer, unlikely to be sticking around without a drastic upturn in form. Whilst not as desperately poor as made out, he looks a shell of the player who lit up Lyon a few years ago and doesn't seem at all suited to the rigours of the Prem.

Jon Flanagan: Broke through a few years ago under Dalglish, and looked a solid, dependable, if not dazzling, RB prospect for the future. Was injured for a lot of last season and found openings limited. He was so underrated that we couldn't even get him a loan to a lower league in the summer - what a win for us that turned out to be. He has suddenly blossomed into an all-action attacking LB, solid defensively but with precision and creativity going forwards. His decision-making still needs a bit of work and, whilst not slow in a straight race, has a tendency to be beaten on the turn. All in all though, first choice LB.

**Centrebacks:**

Daniel Agger (VC): Whilst he is on top form our best defender, this season hasn't been kind to Dagger and a combination of loss of form, injury and exemplary performances from other CBs has seen him spend more time on the bench than we would have hoped at the start of the season. An elegant, ball-playing, tough tackler, but not one to physically dominate opposition attacks and needs balance beside him.

Martin Skrtel: Touted to leave in the summer, Skittles instead stuck around and has cemented himself into the first team with 15 straight starts. The physical presence next to Agger, he has a tendency to be overly physical and can be counted lucky to not concede more fouls from set-pieces. Prone to mistakes and not as commanding as he used to be.

Mamadou Sakho: Absolute brute of a player. Strong, quick, exceptional tackler, good in the air and a composure on the ball that is both calming and frighteningly cavalier (backheels in our penalty area, anyone?). Still far from his prime and should develop into one of the world's best.

Kolo Toure: His age belies his speed and his reading of the game is excellent. Confident on the ball and an all-round good defender. Excellent cover to have as a 4th choice. Quickly became a fan favourite in the summer - I don't think I've ever seen anyone achieve cult status quicker.

Seba Coates: Covered above.

**Central Midfielders:**

Steven Gerrard (C): Captain and club legend (some say the best player the club ever had). It's a shame you've come late to his career and won't have seen him at his best, because what a player that was. His age and injury record from the past few years have blunted his lightning pace, and has had to re-mould himself from devastating attacking midfielder to deep lying metronome. Still one of the best passers of the ball on the planet, and has the capability to score from astounding distances. His tackling is excellent but (I stress again, this is my opinion) doesn't quite have the tactical nous or mobility to be a complete success in the position he currently holds. I say a complete success - the man's already provided 6 goals for us this season from his once-again outlandishly good set piece delivery.

Lucas Leiva: Our only DM at the club, Lucas is a no nonsense operator who has mastered the art of the interception-pass and the ability to pinch the ball from oppo players' feet. Rarely loses aerial duels in the middle of the park. He was developing into the best DM in the world until he suffered two catastrophic injuries back-to-back, which has stunted his development. He may one day return to those heights but it's been a long, slow road to even get him back to this sort of form. He is the metronome of our attacking play but doesn't supply many goals or assists himself. A fan favourite after an initial rough start, whose sheer pigheadedness to succeed brought him to the fore and won the fans over.

Jordan Henderson: Like Lucas, was initially maligned due to indifferent form and a highly inflated price tag. Rodgers attempted to offload him in the summer of '12 in order to get Clint Dempsey. Hendo declined the offer and has since shown Rodgers, the fans and the world what he is capable of. He links the defence and attack seamlessly, can run for eternity and has a creativity and passing range that we caught glimpses off through the years but has exploded into life whilst Gerrard has been injured and he has stepped to the forefront of our play. Classic English ""jack-of-all-trades, master of none"" and needs to work on his long-range shooting and close finishing. Will be the captain of the club in a few years time and has the potential to be a club and country legend if all goes to plan. We have never lost a game in which Hendo has scored.

Joe Allen: A good start to last season whilst out of position was quickly forgotten when a series of indifferent to poor displays followed an undiagnosed shoulder injury which, when discovered, ruled him out for the back end of last year. A neat, tidy passer of the ball, possesses some impressive footwork, has energy in abundance and is a key component of the high-pressing game we have implemented in the last few games. He also needs to improve on his shooting, having scored just once for the club, and also needs a similar renaissance of confidence and mentality that Henderson underwent last season.

**Attacking midfielders/Wingers:**

Phillipe Coutinho: Signed for ¬£8.5m in January 2013, he made an immediate impact upon the league, chipping in with 3 goals and 5 assists in Liverpool's run-in. Has immaculate vision and passing skills, can also beat a man and has useful if not impressive pace. His tackling and shooting are not his best features and has been less excellent this season compared to last, playing a different role than he did previously. Has abundance of time on his side and was recently likened to Ronaldinho by a fellow countryman, Sandro.

Victor Moses: Loaned in from Chelsea off the back of a successful season, Moses started brightly with a goal on debut but has slowly lost form and (it would seem) motivation. Capable of blistering pace and strength, and a tidy finisher, he was deployed out of position whilst Coutinho was injured and reached a nadir at Hull where he was the worst player on the park. Cannot see him sticking around beyond the end of the season.

Raheem Sterling: One of the many Next Big Hopes for England, Sterling was terrorising defences at youth level for ages before he was brought to the club at 15. Given his debut by Dalglish in 2012, his early season form last season was sublime. This faded as he ran out of energy and started picking up injuries. Has pace to match the quickest in the league, a bag full of tricks and an intelligent off the ball runner and finisher. Also surprisingly strong for his size and not a bad tackler. Expectations needs to be kept under wraps though, as he is only 19 and has a long way to go yet. His mentality is not quite there and suffers from many of the same decision making problems as other kids his age.

Luis Alberto: We haven't seen much of Alberto this season, but he looks to be an extremely intelligent user of the ball. I don't know that much about him, really. Perhaps someone else can help there.

**Strikers:**

Luis Suarez: What do you want me to stay? Complete lunatic, complete genius. Has a desire to win unmatched by anyone else in the squad, has the ability to drag a team to a win kicking and screaming. Currently the best striker on the planet and on current form could be argued to be the best player in any position.",0,1387814221,null,0,false,0,ce8ihuk,t3_1tixi3,t1_ce8ihuk,t3_1tixi3,null,1428015736,23,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,23

Actually, most people do not and cannot lose their accents over the course of their lives ‚Äì losing an accent is not something a person can always control and choose for, as you‚Äôre implying. Moreover, no, having a foreign accent does not in fact mean others will have difficulty understanding them ‚Äì what an ignorant thing to say!

As for the issues integrating because of judgement and rejection: yes, this is precisely what I‚Äôm objecting to. 

You're suggesting that it's ok to other and alienate somebody on the basis of their accent. The point is not whether you ""sound non-native"" or not - obviously somebody without a British accent will sound like they don't have a British accent. The point is that that's not a strong basis for determining whether somebody *actually is British*.

true,phys1cs,null,null,"Seawater uranium extraction is not economically viable *at current uranium prices*. A trail in Japan suggested an upper cost of [88,000 yen](http://jolisfukyu.tokai-sc.jaea.go.jp/fukyu/mirai-en/2006/4_5.html) per kg(U), equivalent to $340 per lb U3O8. The OECD suggest that 'the cost of extraction is estimated to be very high, on the order of USD300/kgU' (~$120/lb U3O8). [Recent work](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22201-record-haul-of-uranium-harvested-from-seawater.html#.UrhbBrQt1Js) by ORNL suggests a cost equivalent to about $265/lb U308.

None of this is anywhere near being economically viable, but it's still easily affordable from the perspective of electricity generation. Even with no other technological advances other than scaling up existing techniques, it puts a hard upper limit on the cost uranium could get to, and that's still pretty cheap per MWh. Thorium is widely extracted alongside rare earth elements, where it's an expensive nuisance. Estimates of current reasonably assured reserves vary between 2-3 million tonnes, although again the total number is likely to be much higher. There are absolutely vast quantities of low-grade deposits in granite.

I'd argue that there's plenty of uranium out there to carry on using current-design thermal reactors, but if we really needed it then fast breeders could produce as much fissile material as we wanted (which could be used in LWRs) using depleted uranium and our existing plutonium stockpiles.

Other things not currently economically viable include just about anything other than continued operation of current mines and development of very high grade ores in Canada. *You* are the one basing long-term assumptions on current supply.

Daniel Sturridge: Sturridge's arrival in January was a breath of fresh air to the squad. Immediately likeable, his pace and movement added another dimension to our attack and his finishing ability is excellent. Not a complete player, needs a lot of work to round himself out. Has the odd tendency to be selfish on the ball, and his decision making isn't always the best but definitely a very strong player to have around.

Iago Aspas: Has spent a few months out injured bulking up, so when he returns he should improve upon his promising but lightweight performances. Possesses some speed and a bag of tricks.

**Loanees:**

Pepe Reina: Our No.1 keeper for 8 years, and a fan favourite. His form sloped off in the last couple of years through complacency (and some dodgy coaching in the Hodgson months, it is rumoured). Excellent distributor and shot stopper, and one of the best keepers one-on-one in the world. Unlikely to be a Liverpool player next year.

Jack Robinson: A very quick, hot headed LB. Only 19 years of age, I think he could be very, very good, but this view is not shared by everyone or even I suspect by many. Good defender for his age and a decent attacker at worst. Could be a Liverpool player next year.

Andre Wisdom: Built like a brick shithouse and quick to boot, Wisdom is a bone rattling tackler and has decent if not exceptional technical ability. Prone to mistakes and diving into tackles, he has a long way to go to become a starting CB. Age is on his side and Rodgers seems to be a fan. Will be a Liverpool player next year.

Conor Coady: I know I'm definitely in a minority as far as rating Coady goes - the only exceptional part of his play I can see are his leadership skills and his penalty taking. Decent passer, decent tackler, although has apparently improved whilst at Sheffield United. Could be a Liverpool player next year.

Krisztian Adorjan: Intelligent attacking/central midfielder, who definitely has a goal in him. Good passer, good vision, skilful on the ball. Flowering at Groningen on loan apparently, and they would like to keep hold of him. Could be a Liverpool player next year but doubtful.

Suso: Having an absolutely stormer for Almeria this season. Has been astonishingly good in his first season of regular first team football, with 2 goals and 5 assists from 15 games, mostly on the RW. Has got skill, vision, passing and a good shot on him, with a new found willingness to track back and put in a tackle. Likely to be a Liverpool player next year, but that could depend on how much game time he wants.

Oussama Assaidi: Nippy, agile little winger with a lot of skill but regularly goes missing from games and seems to struggle with the physicality of the league. Has the technical attributes to succeed and some of the physical ones but may not possess the right mentality to force him on. Recently scored an absolute beauty of a winner for Stoke against Chelsea. Unlikely to be a Liverpool player next year.

Henoc Mukendi: I know fuck all about the kid. Highly unlikely to be a Liverpool player next year.

Adam Morgan: Excellent finisher but his form and development haven't kept up with his early promise. His loan at Yeovil has a clause which would allow them to sign him permanently in January. Highly unlikely to be a Liverpool player next season.

Fabio Borini: Has the ability to score lots of goals as shown by his season for Roma but has disappointed in England. An intelligent and quick runner off the ball, his on-ball work is tidy but lacks verve and he seems to suffer from infrequent but crippling bouts of no confidence. Could be a Liverpool player next year.

I was a violent minority and by the mid 1990s they were vanishing as a visible force. So , believe me I know EXACTLY what they were up to. 

Here's the think - when people make essentialist arguments they always says X group does this because it is inherent to X group. Thus you're repeating that Muslims do X things and thus it is their fault. 

The issue with this kind of essentialist argument is that if you can show that it's not specific to one group the whole narrative falls apart. This is what we do when we examine contextual phenomena in social science. this is why polling evidence comes with a huge warning about sample sizes, distribution and methodology. 

The Tamil Tigers started the trend for Suicide bombings - a communist nationalist group that was recently defeated in Sri Lanka. In of itself that defeat the essentialist narrative you just posted. If all Muslims are potential suicide bombers - then what does that make the TT? Muslims? 

No, because they're a) Hindu and b) communist nationalists. So you can either continue to believe that only muslims are prone to suicide bombings  - or you can more accurately say suicide bombing is a method used by various groups around the world. it's not essentally a muslim thing. 

Let's take circumcision- most US males are circumcised, and most practicing Jews are. Does this make US males secret Muslims, does this mean that Jews hate Britain should be targeted because their practices a ""bad""? No. Any reasonably analysis would indicate otherwise. 

I could go through the rest of the list and make the same points.

I remember walking around Camden at 2am for funsies and was approached by a Liverpudlian man.

I quizzed him further and it turned out he had close friends that were of Caribbean and north African decent. These individuals were not 'blacks' but rather, British. The difference was perhaps semantic at times, his friends defined themselves as British first and foremost.

This sentiment anecdotally, seemed to be echoed throughout the UK and indeed the western continent. From an outsider's perspective there seems to be this contemporary conflict between traditional conceptions of national identity and the influences of migration and globalisation; the struggle to redefine nationalism in an increasingly globalised world.

true,blorg,null,null,"OP is a British citizen of Pakistani origin and is concerned about being accepted by wider British society and feeling that there is growing intolerance. I mentioned the ""go home"" vans for example which were a Conservative initiative. OP explicitly mentioned that *we used to get told to go ‚Äúback where you came from‚Äù*, it's a concern of his.

Now it's a spectrum, and I'm sure there are UKIP supporters that would fully welcome him to live and practice his religion here freely but they *tend* to be a little less welcoming of the likes of OP than voters from the other end of the block.

Are you honestly going to argue that the UKIP is one of the more welcoming parties when it comes to British Muslims? That their supporters are more welcoming to the likes of OP?

For example, look at [this survey](http://www.islamophobia-watch.com/islamophobia-watch/2012/3/9/bnp-and-ukip-voters-views-on-muslims-and-islam.html) where BNP and UKIP supporters were asked their views on Islam.

&gt; Suppose some Muslims wanted to build a mosque in your community. Is this something that would...

Bother you a lot - BNP 82.0% UKIP 63.8% National average 30.7%

OK, so they're not quite as bad as the BNP, but that is faint praise. And they've taken votes from the BNP also as they are seen as more acceptable. **A majority of UKIP supporters would be ""bothered a lot"" by OP wanting to practice his religion in their community, at a rate *double* the national average.**

&gt; We also asked respondents about the extent to which they agree or disagree with the statement that Islam does not pose a serious danger to the West. Over three quarters of BNP supporters in our sample strongly disagree that Islam is not a threatening religion, whereas **almost two thirds of UKIP supporters similarly feel strongly that Islam poses a threat to the West.** In fact, less than one out of every ten BNP and UKIP supporter in our sample endorse the suggestion that Islam does not pose a threat to the West.

You can argue the ups and downs of this but *completely putting aside immigration and the EU* the fact is **UKIP supporters are *subtantially* less likely to be welcoming of a British Muslim, no matter whether he was born and bred here and as British as anyone else,** simply based on their religion.",0,1387816521,null,0,false,0,ce8jbny,t3_1tiaka,t1_ce8jbny,t1_ce8itw4,null,1428015350,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,jason_in_sd,lfc93,,"American here. Welcome, I was in your shoes about 1 year ago. You will love the sense of community, and couldn't be coming in at a better time. Were #1 in the prem league (although arsenal plays at 12:00pst today and could jump is), but heading into some very tough fixtures.

Some things I've learned being an American LFC fan over the last year: 

-Our local rivals are Everton. Baseball relation would be Giants and A's though, it's a more friendly rivalry. You can theoretically root for both teams unless the EFC outcome will effect LFC.

-Our competitive rivals are Manchester United. Baseball relation, Yankees/Red Sox or Giants/Dodgers. This is bred from years of competitions, trash talk, etc. We want them to fail at anything they do. They also just hired a new manager this year, who happened to be Everton's last manager (David Moyes). He has a problem winning at Liverpool, it's a bit comical now.

-There are a few other teams that always are competing year after year. They have become big games for us and minor rivalries, but mostly just because they, like us, are always good and so were always competing with them. Those teams are Arsenal, Manchester City, Chelsea, Tottenham.

-Our home stadium is Anfield. I think there is a section at Anfield called ""The Kop"" and I would equate it to the Raiders ""Black Hole"" in the sense that the most dedicated and crazy fans sit there. I'm not comparing our fans to raider fans btw. Just went to the Raiders/Chargers game yesterday, they are terrible people.

-Our Captain is Steven Gerrard. Local boy, grew up in the LFC system since 8 years old. Went on to become to best player from like 02-12 and won a bunch of ""silverware"" (trophies) for the club. Cool as fuck, sweet accent, hot wife. Almost got bought away by Chelsea in 06, but stayed. He also captains England's international squad.

-Our best player now is Luis Suarez. He's from Uruguay and plays striker. Arguably in the top 5 players in the world, and on form with Ronaldo for top in the world right now. He is pretty much hated everywhere outside of Liverpool. He got an 8 match ban for racially abusing Patrice Evra of ManU awhile back and a 10 match ban for biting a Chelsea defender last season. He also spent the summer verbally ""wanting away"" (trying to transfer) but the manager Brenden Rodgers stood firm and kept him. He has now seemingly gotten his act together. But it's pretty well known that we need to at least make it to the champions league if we want him to stay going forward.

-Our goal is to win the Premier League, but really, being in the ""Top 4"" of the PL is the realistic goal. The top 4 teams are invited to the ""Champions League"" tournament the following year where you get to play the big boys like Real Madrid and Barca. There is a tons of money associated with this and helps attract the top players in the world to your club. The rich get richer. Were one of only 3 teams that have one the Champions League 5 times (Real Madrid, AC Milan?)&lt;-- someone help. It's a VERY big bragging right. Last year, it was Man U, Man City, Arsenal, Chelsea that got these spots.  They're all still alive and this tournament is going on right now as well.

-Finishing in 5th gets you a spot in the Europa League. A lesser tournament, but still something. Last year, Tottenham got this spot. They're into the ""knockout stage of this tournament right now.

-There are also other tournaments always going on during the season. The FA cup, League Cup, Europa League, Champions League, etc. So throughout the year, you might see Tues/Wed/Thurs games pop up. 

-I'm in San Diego, games range from 4:45a-11:00 on Sat. Be prepared for early games.

-Soccer terms are different. The field is the ""pitch."" You watch the ""match"" not game. The standings are called the ""table."" A 5-0 match would be pronounced five, nil. And I think the sideline is the ""touch line"" over there.

-A ""nutmeg"" is when you dribble the ball through someone's legs, think basketball. It's just a ""cheeky"" (funny/smart ass) thing to do in soccer. Luis Suarez is know for it.

But the obvious flaw in that is you can make a law against a particular action/set of behaviour and the right disappears. 

And if it's law there's not that much you can do to argue against it. What the ECHR does is codify a set of basic rights so that there's protection even if a state does enact a law to forbid act X.

There are a lot of ""of course it wouldn't be"" comments in here from people who haven't actually looked at the relevant law. Please see below as to why you wouldn't want any of Reddit's armchair lawyers acting for you.

The England/Wales* definition of theft is governed by the [Theft Act 1968](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/crossheading/definition-of-theft). Section 1(1) of that act defines theft as the (1)dishonest (2)appropriation of (3)property (4)belonging to another with the (5)intention of permanently depriving the other of it.

Each of the above numbers precedes an essential element of theft. Each of those elements must be satisfied for an offence to have taken place. For the sake of ease, we'll ignore elements (1)-(3) and (5) as they're fairly obviously made out. It all hinges around element (4): the ownership element.

Property ""belonging to another"" isn't as straightforward as ""have they paid for it?"". There's a whole bunch of caselaw here, but for our purposes we can look to section 5 of the Theft Act 1968 for a basic definition, which includes a provision that:

&gt; Property shall be regarded as belonging to any person having possession or control of it...

So, then: did your trolley pushing victim have control over the turkey before you pilfered it? Yes; they've already exercised lawful control by picking it up and putting it in their basket. Did they have possession? Yes, it's in their trolley as they wheel up and down the aisles.

All of the elements are thus made out for theft (although realistically speaking it's extremely unlikely that you would be prosecuted for doing so).

true,Obidom,cnty-uk,Cheshire,"Here try [this](http://www.propertyinvestmentproject.co.uk/blog/what-landlords-should-know-about-white-goods)

&gt;White goods refer to large electrical home appliances that are typically finished in white enamel. In letting/rental terms, they generally refer to the major kitchen appliances, such as fridges, washing machines and dish washers.

&gt;You‚Äôll notice a lot of rental adverts declare that they do provide white goods. They‚Äôre generally referring to the major kitchen appliances.

ok so thats clear about them being whitegoods etc

&gt;However, it‚Äôs important to note that most rental accommodation these days do come with white goods. Consequently, by failing to provide what is considered as ‚Äúbasic amenities‚Äù you could be scaring away a lot of potential tenants away. Some times it‚Äôs worth loosening the purse strings and providing white goods for the sake of getting tenants

Now here is the important part

&gt;This is a bit of a misunderstood area, as a lot of people think that if landlords supply the goods, then they also become responsible for repairs by default. When actually, that‚Äôs not the case, as it‚Äôs made very clear that White goods do not form part of the landlords repairing/maintenance obligations under section 11, Landlord &amp; Tenant Act 1985.

&gt;It should state in the Assured Shorthold Tenancy Agreement who is responsible for repairing White goods. I personally take responsiblity for repairing White goods, but I generally get 3-5 year warranties on all my products. If they need repair outside the warrenty period, that probably means they‚Äôve lived their life.

&gt;If the tenant is responsible for repairing the white goods and it is stated in the AST, I would recommend discussing this before the tenants sign the contracts. This will avoid any problems if your tenants are unexpectedly informed they‚Äôre responsible for repairing/replacing any white goods.

So check the AST you signed, will tell you there who is responsible, but if they were broken when you moved in you should have had them fixed before you signed the contract",0,1387820687,null,0,false,0,ce8kykh,t3_1tjbdj,t1_ce8kykh,t1_ce8k859,null,1428014587,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I always wanted to get into European soccer, but I didn't have an excuse. Then Henry bought Liverpool, and I thought, hell, this is a good excuse as any.

So I dove in. I watched Liverpool documentaries, watched highlights of the best players, started reading blogs, started streaming every game (SO much better now with NBC), watched classic games, started following this subreddit... and let me be clear:

**This is the single greatest sports decision I've ever made in my life.** 

I had no idea I'd get this hooked. I'm completely in love with Liverpool, and I think you will be too.

I can't get enough of it. It's a blast to watch and follow. Best supporters in the world, best club in the world. The history, the passion, the game itself. It's beautiful. Plus this subreddit kicks ass.

I encourage you to go for it, man.

Depends on how you look at it. Takes me 20 mins to cycle into the city, takes me 35 mins plus parking fees to drive.

The issue governments face is not about ""making it harder"", its about giving people extra options outside getting stuck in traffic.

Those who insist (for whatever reason) on driving can continue todo so - those who feel public transport, walking or cycling should be encouraged todo so if only because it will be better for everyone (inc drivers).

&gt;The rest of the civilized world says hi.

What are you scared of? serious question, both the Netherlands and Copenhagen are some of the happiest countries on the planet. And their cities are some of the most ""livable"" in the world. Removing the car (for the most part) is something Iv never heard a negative thing about. 

Well, heard plenty of scaremongering on Fox news and the like.

And remember - no ones being anti car. Its possible to be pro (say public transport) without shitting on cars.

true,Lordzoot,,Pint of piss.,"&gt;And how do you propose the sort of people who live payday to payday and can barely afford a low budget smartphone...

Well, let's not get into a political argument on that subject. There are many answers to this question including providing computers through community centres or providing computers in a much smaller 'library building' (or perhaps even in shopping centres etc like Amazon locker). If people are living payday to payday and want a library service, my guess is that they're going to want it within walking distance of their home, rather than in Birmingham city centre, where they'll probably need to pay for public transport. Free wireless broadband throughout the UK is probably going to be a real possibility in the next couple of years too.

&gt; You're thinking of a library as a room where you keep books, and that's not what it is. Libraries are information gateways.

Yes, and they've now been surpassed by computers, which are a) quicker b) more useful c) can provide more information and more accurate information d) require a smaller footprint. 

The computer and the internet are the new 'information gateways'. Library usage is dropping.

&gt;So other cities and towns are closing their library services. Too bad for them, but why should that be the way for Birmingham? I can't have it, so nobody can?

Because when any local authority borrows money, it is essentially doing so at the expense of something else. That's ¬£193m that could have bee invested in other capital projects, or perhaps not at all, thus not putting a further strain on public finances. Birmingham, for instance, has a huge crisis in its social care departments. 

It's up to Brum how it spends its money - I just wonder how many sports centres, local libraries, community centres etc etc will close in the city in the next few years through lack of funding. 

In a world of infinite money, yes, this would be a great idea and a shining example of what the country's library services could aspire to be. In the real world, ¬£193m of borrowing seems to take the prudent out of prudential. ",0,1387821585,null,0,false,0,ce8lbwb,t3_1th77s,t1_ce8lbwb,t1_ce8k48p,null,1428014414,1,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,1

But this is demonstrably false.  A lot of Christians (and other people) don't believe in the big bang, or evolution, or man-made global warming, or that condoms are effective, or that homeopathy isn't.  These opinions are not worthy of respect, they are just ignorant.  Sexual orientation *can* be fluid, but for most people it isn't.

Removing the 4 goal game was going toward ur argument of 12 in 24 games. It makes it look like he scores every other game, with consistency. When its not true. Removing the four goal game also shows you that 1/3 of his goals came in a single game. This also goes back to a point I made which was how patient fans would be with a guy that doesn't score consistently. Look at what happened to borini, if you look at what tottenham fans are saying about lamela, you'd think they bought a striker that cant score, when in fact they bought a CAM OR RW. Or look at arsenal who had vela but didn't give him enough games. Remember it took vela almost half the season at Real to get his scoring going, but one thing Real did recognize was that he was a good player and thqt goals didn't translate his play on the field.

true,forgottenoldusername,eng-manchester,It is indeed grim up north.,"Often people say you shouldn't love or like what you had no say in. And that's right, people born in the UK had no say about that at all.
But why does that mean we should not love it?

A silly example of what I mean is this:
I didn't have a say on how tall I was going to be. But I like being 191cm tall, much taller and I would have been unhappy.

I didn't have a say on who my mother was, yet I love her.

I love them things because they have helped me, made me into who I am now.

At the same time, so has my country. I have no doubt at all that I would have turned out very differently indeed if I was born in Latin America for example. Being born in England has shaped me, changed me and even formed some of my personal views as a direct result.

Being British/English/Scots/Saudi/whatever is a thing, to some it's just a name for where they are from and to others it's an identity, a way of associating one with their peers.. I am fond of British history, British 'tradition', British stereotypes, British inventions and discoveries. And though I had nothing at all to do with them inventions and discoveries, I can still identify with the people who put their minds towards them - We were both born on this little island, as a result no doubt I will share many of the same memories, feelings and opinions as a future highly successful British inventors or scientists of my generation will. 

If I am abroad and hear a British accent, I can identify with them, no doubt find common ground.
I am proud when looking at some of the stunning scenery we have in this country, the great cities or towns, and to be able to think 'I am from here. This is home.' is something some place high value upon.

I'm not saying I would rally up and fight for my country, no matter what. I obviously wouldn't. Like I said, some of the things the UK/Great Britain has done in the past as a country are hideous. If something goes against my personal morals then I obviously wont follow my country blindly. But I do happen to like my country, for better or worse. 

Now having said that, I can fully understand why someone might not love/like their country, for whatever reason!
But to suggest someone is strange for loving where they happen to be born is frankly, a bit narrow-minded. OP identifies as British, he likes the UK - If that works for him then good on him.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"I think we shouldn't look to change our shape too much, we're really figuring out how to play in it now.  I also think we need to be careful about making too many changes in the middle of the season.  Once Sturridge and Enrique are fit I like this:

-----------------Mignolet----------------

Montoya--Agger--Sakho--Flannagan/Enrique

------------Allen---Fernando--------------

---------------Henderson--------------

Suarez-------Sturridge-------Coutinho

Few things: 

If Flannagan's form doesn't drop, I think he's more effective than Enrique.  He's not quite as defensively sound (especially 1v1 but he reads the game well and makes great open play tackles) but IMO he offers much more going forward and he gets into really good positions when we're attacking.  That's a huge IF though, and I doubt it'll happen.  As long as he's playing as well as he is I think he should keep playing.

Johnson hasn't found himself again after his injury.  We were linked with Montoya not long ago and he's really good.  He attacks almost like a winger, quite solid technically and 1v1 going forward.  He's suited to our style coming from Barca as well but I think he's rather defensively suspect at the moment.  Johnson just hasn't been more than average for me.  I'm fully expecting it to still be Johnson in the number 1 spot, but I'm a big fan of Montoya and hey... a man can dream right? 

Fernando is a freaking beast.  I've loved him since I watched him and Hulk (and, ironically, Cissokho) play an extremely good game against United in the Champion's League a few years ago.  The game ended 2-2 but Fernando and Hulk were the standout players for Porto and really for the whole match.  I've been waiting for him to make it move to one of the huge clubs in Spain/Italy/England since then to be it's interesting that it hasn't happened yet.  He tackles as good as Lucas but also is much more mobile.  I think Lucas is a little more intelligent but the energy that Fernando/Henderson/Allen would bring is just absurd.  There will be no space for the opposing midfield to play in as they'll be everywhere.  Lucas and Fernando are pretty interchangeable for me so it can be a matter of form and what the opposition looks like for which one gets the nod at times.  Allen is going to be become really important to us in the next couple of seasons as we really bed in our way of playing too, it just suits him perfectly (plus he's just 23 years old... really easy to forget how young he is).  No Gerrard starting in my midfield, at least not every game.  I might catch hell for this because he's a living legend, and believe me it's not easy to exclude him as he's literally my favorite player of all time.  He's just so slow now, he feels behind the game a lot.  He can't be depended on to recover properly and he isn't mobile enough to press effectively.  His distribution is absolutely incredible but I think we need the athleticism and energy more.  It's a sad day to see Gerrard this way, he was the best midfielder in the world for a while IMO and he's my footballing idol.  He can definitely still play a hugely important role, but I think against the sides with the really strong midfields a la City, Chelsea, Arsenal, etc we need to really slug it out with them and he just isn't physically able to do that anymore.  Henderson has enthusiastically picked up the creative slack and he's chipped in with a great return of assists in the past few matches (4 in his last 3 matches I think?) too, so the creative loss is at least somewhat limited.

Our forwards are just nuts, we're SO STRONG in the attack.  Coutinho makes it all tick and Suarez is the best player in the league, possibly the world right now.  Sturridge coming back into it changes things slightly as it makes us  little more narrow initially.  Both Sturridge and Suarez love to pop out to the flanks to find space to receive the ball though, so they're going to be moving around and changing places A LOT.  Sturridge lines up more centrally because I think Suarez can be just as deadly starting to one side whereas Sturridge's game is diminished by pulling him out of the middle.  They'll both be moving around so much you probably won't really be able to tell who started where anyway.  Just let them be at their best, they'll be fluid and in constant motion and it'll be beautiful.  This does make us more narrow as both Suarez and Coutinho love to come inside.  It takes away that glorious outlet that Sterling has provided us over the last few matches but it also frees up Johnson/Montoya/whoever is RB to really get on down the flank.

I think we still need attacking reinforcements and provided we sign a fullback (obviously I hope it's Montoya) our defensive depth looks great.  Fernando really makes our midfield look much deeper as we'll still have Lucas/Gerrard available (WTF sueprsubs?!).  Salah looks a promising player for sure and he'd be a great add.  With him and Sterling available we can easily change the dynamic of our attack by bringing either one of them on to stretch play out and create lots of width.  I think Aspas will be fine as the extra striker and I don't expect to see both Sturridge and Suarez missing games at the same time... unless Suarez gets hungry mid-match again that is.  These last few matches have really made me reconsider what our current players are capable of.  I think we're bang on for a top 4 spot with just a couple of additions in January and then we can use that to really step up the recruiting come summer.  Players are always more expensive in January and 6 months later once the season ends and we're back in the Champion's League we'll be able to attract a higher level of talent, so we should be waiting for that before we really go for it in terms of transfer business.

&gt;I was specifically talking about so-called rape gangs. 

You're not seriously saying Paedophilia isn't rape? Really, so if a person is a Muslim it's a rape gang and non-muslims like Jimmy Saville - aided and abetted by the UK establishment - don't rape their victims? How does that work? 

Obviously you don't think this:

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/there-was-no-escape-victims-open-up-as-north-wales-care-homes-probe-uncovers-systemic-and-serious-sexual-and-physical-abuse-over-three-decades-8594784.html

was organised rape by a gang of paedophiles?

 &gt; As well as this there is only one group in this country who practices FGM on a rampant scale. 

FGM is established as a sub-saharan practice - it's unheard of in South Asain Muslims - who are the MAJORITY of Muslims in this country. 

Why do you keep conflating the two things? Having difficulty separating the two concepts? 

&gt;I notice you don't contend the whole terrorism issue, which is by far the biggest problem people have with Islam.

I noticed you don't contend with the Real IRA.. and only focus on the Islam aspect of terrorism. If you were true to the analysis you were putting forward you would be demanding that all nationalists / catholics be treated the same way Muslim terror suspects are. You're not. Thus there's a flaw in the logical consistency in your argument. Or you're just here for a fight. i can quite happily contend that religion, in of itself , is not a motive for terrorism (the ""in of itself"" is important - try Hegel). You can't.

&gt; how you would be treated in the Pakistani community and by your family if you left Islam. 

People would be very unhappy. No doubt. Some wouldn't talk to me, some wouldn't care. Depending on who they are and how much they know about Islam itself. It also depends on what I do after I leave Islam - do I actively pursue an agenda against Muslims or not. 

However, I'm also a shia muslim, so the nutters who would abuse Islam to call me kafir - do so anyway - it won't make much difference to them. Its the same as excommunication to some extent.

people are sick of hearing stories about how 'hard done by' muslims are and then how they get away with things because of their religion. some even use their religion as a defence for some horrendous crimes. 

Just look at the widely covered Lee rigby murder case, Micheal adebolajo and Micheal adebowale both confess to killing that man, but say they did it in the name of allah and for that they will be praised in the after life. How would that come across to you as a non muslim, you would just see pure hate within that religion. 

(http://www.britainfirst.org/news/nine-men-jailed-for-rochdale-child-sex-crimes/)

let me emphasise this is by no means the view of ALL muslims as you would agree, but what we see and what we are fed about a minority of muslims puts you and other muslims into that light. The problem isnt about the public at all, its about your portrayal and the fact that our judicial system lets the minority get away with things that the majority of the country wouldnt solely based on that religion. 
Unfortunately for you, your born into a majority christian country, and in a time when horrendous crimes being committed by muslims are consistently in the news, your in a loose loose scenario. People naturally move to defensive mechanisms and see you a religion as the attacking force. 
I could go on and on with examples, but like i said this is a minority view (i hope haha) and this proves that the massive coverage of these stories does affect a national level of thinking and behaviour:

Generally, if a poll was conducted by an established pollster, and you have looked at the question they asked and it seems pretty fair, you can trust it.  The two other things to watch out for are (1) people making conclusions about contrasts between different groups of people when that wasn't the aim of the poll, which is problematic as the subsamples they are comparing might be too small to make any conclusions, and (2) polls that were initially private but later released by whoever commissioned them - this is an indication that they are selectively releasing only the polls showing the outcome they want (political parties often do this).

He is now a 60-70 minute player.  Go back and watch any of the games he's started since he aggravated his hip last season.  Early in the 2nd half, he starts slowing down and by the 60 minute mark, he's usually noticeably limping.  Also, even early in games, he has been slow in getting back, walking, etc. quite a bit more.  (See the 1st Liverpool goal) 

As good as he is, starting Dembele means that there is at least a 50% chance one of your subs will have to be used for him, regardless of other injury or tactical changes that need to be made.  As of now, it's still worth it to start him, but that may not be the case for long.   Such a shame too, what a great player. 

As far as surgery, he hasn't had surgery not because of the time off it would mean for him, but because it has been determined that the surgery would be of little to no benefit. A lot of people misunderstood the clubs statements at the time to mean he didn't NEED surgery, but it was that it wouldn't do much good.   [one random source](http://itv.co/1kzHx7H)

In my opinion, it really depends on what you're planning to do with the bike. The 125 I had was great for learning on, very forgivable and got something like 70 mpg - basically a great introduction to biking. Problem was, it wouldn't do anything greater than 60 (50 uphill) which meant I couldn't use it for riding on the dual carriageway for extended periods of time which was a pain if I'm honest. Second issue was that on a CBT you're not allowed on motorways - meaning doing any sort of extended journey is impossible. The final problem was the cost of the 125 - it seems they're so popular these days with CBT holders that their prices are artificially inflated, meaning you have to spend more than you would on an equivalent big bike. 

I have an A2 licence with a restricted 600 and to be perfectly honest I love it to pieces. Compared to the 125 it's just in an entirely different league, despite being restricted. No problems keeping up with traffic and up to about 70MPH it's faster than just about anything else on the road. However, if I had never ridden a bike before going straight to such a heavy bike would make it difficult to manage - throttle control on a 125 is infinitely easier to manage than on a 600 where you have so much more grunt to contend with. Granted, if you're learning at a training centre you'll be used to it after a few hours of riding though. The 125 will be MUCH more forgiving in terms of you fucking it up - you won't be popping any accidental throttle wheelies and will be able to control it in the slow technical stuff wayyy better.  

Here's the next problem, being aged 22 means that you are in that area whereby it would almost be illogical to get your A2 licence. This is because you have to test once for your A2 and once again for you A licence after two years of you having had the A2. So, factor in the cost (for me about 600 odd quid for a weeks training and tests) and the future cost of your next test in two years and it starts to add up - not forgetting you'll have to take your CBT regardless before you start properly training. 

Have you got a driving licence? If you have road knowledge, a CBT will more than suffice for learning the very basics - the rest you learn on the road as you go and through further reading. Furthermore the CBT lasts two years from the date you pass, meaning you'll be able to take it now and won't have to re-take it if you do your A licence in two years time (saving of about 100 quid) plus you'll have the benefit of two years road experience to boot! 

So, if it were me in your shoes I'd probably go for doing my CBT now, getting the bike and getting used to riding and controlling the thing. Then, wait two years and take your full A licence and be done with it - no re-testing or wasting money on two tests (which IMO is a completely ridiculous idea in the first place).

Rolf is alive and able to defend himself from charges, if the CPS (or whoever is prosecuting) makes a case able to convince a jury that he is guilty of those charges i will have to take it on trust (or faith i guess) that the case was good and the evidence strong enough to convict.

When you have someone who is dead all you can do is investigate the claims put forward, and for Saville those claims are numerous and span many years. If enough claims have strong evidence to support them then the public at large has to make up its own mind if the evidence that exists is strong enough to destroy the reputation, narrative and history of that person. That is all you can really do when someone is dead.

&gt;The Access to HE Diploma has a standard credit value of 60 credits, with 45 at level 3, and students 
cannot be awarded an Access to HE Diploma without achieving this. Achievement transcripts issued with 
Diplomas provide evidence of students' achievement of each unit (including titles and grades for all level 3 
units) which, taken together, make up the achievement of the standard 60 credits. Courses are designed, 
funded and delivered on the basis of this standard credit requirement for the qualification. Offers asking 
for more than 60 credits would require achievement outside the Access to HE Diploma, which may not 
be available or achievable. No more than 60 credits are listed on students' Access to HE achievement 
transcripts, which give unit grades. The grading system provides a standard way of differentiating between 
students' academic performance.

It seems, then, that the only way you can even get a access diploma is by getting 60 credits worth of subjects - so you must be doing that somehow as it is. Are you doing anything outside of academia that entitles you to extra credit? I've not got any direct experience with it, but from what i've read you must be getting more credits than that - as it says, otherwise the course doesn't actually get you a diploma.

There's been lots and lots of hype in the media about Sherwood; every former Spurs player from the last 20 years has crawled out of the woodwork to say how wonderful he is, whipping up the fans to support the appointment. But frankly, it's a big, big risk. This is a guy who has never managed before at any level. That doesn't mean that he's necessarily bad, but if you look at the track record of coaches promoted internally in the Premier League it's not good. Loads of coaches have an amazing reputation behind the scenes but find the step up to management too difficult. There is literally no evidence whatsoever to suggest he can manage at a top level. I think the board timed the appointment quite cleverly, knowing everyone is still on a high after yesterday's game.

The main problem facing Sherwood is that the management won't take him as seriously as they would a manager hired from outside the club. It's unlikely he'll be given the same budget as AVB or Redknapp or anyone else. More importantly, the first time he fucks up, he'll be under pressure. As soon as we lose a few games, everyone will claim he's out of his depth.

My view is that they shouldn't be demonised nor should they be fetishised like they seem to be in the States.  It has to be said though, that most places I have been with lots of guns in the hands of the general public were decidedly sketchy and either had or were about to descend into chaos (I'm mainly looking at you here West Africa - you have form for this sort of behavior and apparently little self control)

Anyway, anecdote time. Most of my pleasant gun memories come from dating a cute blond lass called Thecla when I was 16/17,  way back in the early '80s when my folks moved to Oman for a bit.  Thecla's Dad was a contract soldier working for the Sultanate down in Salalah near the Yemenie border and had the ""keys"" to the regimental range.  On Fridays (Islamic Sunday) we would go down to the range to shoot off what ever we could ""borrow"" from the armory under his watchful eye.  Basically there was nothing else to do and I think he wanted to keep me firmly in sight when I was around his daughter. The main toys were L85A1's (which were in my opinion pants), FN FAL's (which I liked) and AK47's (very cool).  Other frequent events included going camping in the desert for the weekend and shooting at tin cans with belt fed L7A2's mounted on landrovers.

Now, the judge in this case had the choice of what punishment to hand down. They chose the one they did.

Regardless of whether you agree with it or not that's the SYSTEM we live under. The REALITY we have to deal with.

true,LuminiferousEthan,null,null,"It's been a while since I saw the episode, but I'll give it a go.

&gt;First, why did River have to (sort of) die to free the people in the database?

*Someone* had to sit in the machine thing to get the ""saved"" people to be ""loaded"" again. The Doctor was going to do it. River knocked him out and took his place. The process would have killed whoever it was who did it. 

&gt;Second, River spoke about singing towers and the Doctor realizing he needed to tell River his name for some reason as well as give her a screwdriver we haven't seen him use yet. This episode hasn't happened yet. Is there any indication that this will be in the Christmas Special?

No. The Doctor and River share a *lot* of off screen time together. There are little mini episodes on one of the season special features which show them going on ""dates"" and such throughout time. They are married, which is why she knows his name. But because they are both time travellers, they always meet in the ""wrong order"". Which is why Tennent doesn't know who she is, but she knows who he is. His first time meeting her, is her last time meeting him. 

&gt;Third, what happened to the Vashta Nerada? They haven't appeared again, did he do something to keep them in the libraray? I didn't understand most of his conversation with the ghosting Anita, where she let him go giving him one day to do something.

I don't really remember if he somehow removed them from the library.

&gt;This story made it seem like the Nerada were in every dark space in the universe, and that's why every species is scared of the dark. But later on he clarifies that they hunt in forests. So which is it? Dark forests, or dark only?

As he said himself, they're not in *every* shadow. But they can be in *any* shadow. I would guess that their natural habitat is in forests. But they can end up being transported elsewhere, (I'm guessing they weren't there when the library was first built), or can migrate, or simply become lost and end up somewhere else where they would breed in a dark place which is not a forest. 

&gt;Fifth, am I just bad at understanding things or did other people get this confused?

I wouldn't worry about it too much. The very nature of the show dictates that some things won't make sense. They do pretty good at explaining a lot, but a lot is left unexplained too. Maybe because my grandmother had a thick accent, I'm pretty good at understanding the accents in the show. But I can see how some people wouldn't be.

A lot of this stems from having the ability to empathise with other people and appreciate that although their concerns may not be relevant to you - they are none the less legitimate to those people.

What I point out to my Polish friends for example when we talk about this, is that they should try to empathize with peoples concerns and in doing so realise that they are actually somewhat legitimate... how for example would they react to half their street back in Poland being taken over by English people, to seeing their local supermarket replaced by a specialist English food importer, or to having their usual Saturday market interloped by noisy migrant English football fans who talk loudly in another language, do business in strange ways that seem unusual etc... now imagine how their entrenched-in-their-ways elderly grandparents might react! - above all it would be tremendously intimidating, and I don't think its fair to write being intimidated off as simply xenophobic.

In a nutshell, the true xenophobes are the people who simply dismiss all immigration as inherently bad. But wanting to constrain immigration so as to prevent a rapid cultural change isn't xenophobic. Why after all should Brits that have lived their whole lives here a certain way suddenly have to accommodate change to please foreign nationals?

But this is much of the problem - the type of immigrants we have attracted. Because this current surge has largely come from economic migrants forced here by tough conditions in their home nations, they are less keen to integrate than previous cohorts. If the economic case for immigration could be lessened by a %GDP barrier on free movement in the EU it would mean those people coming to the UK would be more likely to be anglophiles seeking to culturally experience the UK - rather than culturally change the UK to suit their own agendas.

What worries me is that we fell into that same bad habits we always do, just this time we didn't get punished. We played great for 75 minutes then all of a sudden we let them back in it. Combine them with the fact that had it not been for Dave, we would have conceded from **ANOTHER** badly defended corner and I think we were lucky to hold a clean sheet (I think a draw was a fair result though).

Jose knows we have defensive problems and the fact that he hasn't been able to fix them makes me think it's a personnel problem not a tactical one.

1. The fullbacks rarely ventured beyond the halfway LINE AND marked the wingers well. 

2. The midfield worked harder than they have worked all season. 

The reason we didn't score still remains the same - too much dribbling. Hazard and Willian need to learn to find a final ball. When they did, there was always someone to receive it at the other end. Heck, Ramires managed to get a header off! RAMIRES! 

People blaming Torres, please compare the number of touches Giroud had vs the number of Torres touches. Look at Giroud's heat map vs Torres heat map. A striker who drifts on to the wings is gonna have a bad time at scoring goals. 

People calling for Drogba, please understand, even he would have suffered tonight. Hazard and Willian may have a great workrate but they are bad at creating that final ball and until they learn that, we aren't getting any of our strikers to score - not Torres, not Ba, not Eto'o.

""The only reason we have killed this man today is because Muslims are dying daily by British soldiers. And this British soldier is one"" 

While they were mixing nationalities for a blanket religious term (basically saying Muslim instead of Iraqi, Afghan, Syrian...many other places).  What they did was basically a guerrilla act of war by 2 deranged men thinking they were finally inflicting 'damage' on the British army and making the point that if civilians 'over there' were going to keep on being killed that there would be retaliation.

It is much easier for the media to focus on the Muslim element of these lads actions, and yes these boys were unbelievably radicalised and using this as their excuse for action.  Rather than focusing on the other reason for their action, namely the whole scale civilian deaths across the Arab world by British and American hands 'for democracy'.  If there are any (and I sincerely hope there won't be) further desperate actions like this in an attempt to reverse British foreign policy, I think that the only element that will be focused on by the media will be the colour/ethnicity/religion of the people doing this rather than any of their underlying reasons.

b) no babe's YOU are saying Paedophilia ISN'T rape because YOU differentiate between ""rape-gangs"" and the ""paedophile networks""



and this ""in the last 4 weeks "" stuff is non sequitor. 

Edit .. for those of you who don't know who Baron Bodissey:

""I‚Äôve been paying close attention for the last seven years, and during that time there have been numerous changes in the common discourse at the samizdat level, below what is officially permitted in public discourse. For example, the phrase ‚ÄúMohammed the pedophile‚Äù is now common ‚Äî almost universal ‚Äî in popular forums and discussion groups. It even pops up at the higher levels occasionally, and gets people like Susanne Winter and Elisabeth Sabaditsch-Wolff charged and tried. This meme was very rare until well after 9-11.""

""As a propagandist, my task is to spread the meme and not to sweat the nuances. Nuances can be argued about and nailed down by scholars in the centuries after Islam ‚Äî as a culture, a political ideology, and a religion ‚Äî is totally destroyed. We don‚Äôt have the luxury for such finicky scholasticism right now.""

true,intangible-tangerine,eng-Bristol,Brizzlefoshizzle,"I cringe when people describe themselves as 'gamers' just because they play computer games for a hobby! It's as pretentious as calling yourself 'a traveller' for going on holiday or a 'connoisseur' because you like to eat.  A casual hobby is not an identity! Imagine if everyone who liked to hum along to the radio called themselves a musician or if everyone who'd ever made a pot noodle called themselves a chef! 

What I think when someone calls themselves 'a gamer'.. 

'Oh you like computer games? Do you also like movies and listening to music and going out with friends? What a massive coincidence. So does EVERYONE ELSE.'  

The only people who have any business using the word 'gamer' to refer to themselves are the people who are good enough to earn money or fame through it. If you've won competition money doing it or you have thousands of hits on your youtube walk through videos, yeah, you're a gamer. But if you sit in your pants playing Grand Theft Auto every weekend you're just some lazy arse with the same hobby as everyone else. 

Also - you should only ever put hobbies and interests like gaming on your CV if you're a school leaver with no employment or voluntary experience. Potential employers give less of a shit about your love of movies and music and computer games than I do. Only mention hobbies if they specifically ask you during an interview.

The Library planet was artificial and likely took the forests from a few hundred planets if not a few thousand planets to make the books and book cases. The Vashta Nerada were brought to the library in egg form in the paper in the books. They were in such high concentrations because of the number of forests used to make the books, and they were ravenous due to the lack of dead wildlife to feed upon. They will not naturally get into dangerous concentrations so unless there is another library planet made, or somethings similar there is no reason for them to return as a foe.

&gt;Most of their children are schooled alongside locals. Almost all the women work

""

Walking around Stamford Hill, it is the geometry of family relationships that you notice. There are groups of mothers uniformly dressed in the mandatory dark coats and long skirts, and wearing the wigs that are an obligation for married women, pushing prams, a handful of children in tow. There are groups of men, but seldom men and women together.

Modesty is paramount to the Haredi, and the mingling of the sexes is strictly regulated. Unmarried boys and girls will have little contact with the opposite sex outside their families. At concerts and wedding parties men and women will always be separated. A Haredi man will avoid making eye-contact with any woman other than his wife, and would never shake hands.

Among the Gerer, the more traditional will observe the rule that even husbands and wives should not be seen walking on the street together, giving rise to the joke: 'Who was that woman I saw you with last night?' 'Not my wife! Not my wife!'

The Torah, the Five Books of Moses that constitute Judaism‚Äôs founding texts, and which are held to be the unmediated word of God, contains 613 Mitzvot - or 'dos and don‚Äôts‚Äô - of which one, held among Haredi to be perhaps the most important, is to study Torah.

The act of study is a supreme religious obligation, as much for the layman as the rabbi, and the talmid hakham - the student of the Talmud, the compendious volumes of rabbinical discussions pertaining to Jewish law and custom - is venerated above all others.

All Haredi children in Stamford Hill attend Jewish schools, all of them single-sex, and all but one of them private. 
......

 For boys in particular, education revolves almost entirely around religious studies. The school week can sometimes be more than 40 hours, with the non-religious curriculum taking up only six or seven hours, mostly covering English, mathematics and general knowledge.

In the last round of Ofsted inspections in 2008, more than a third of the strictly Orthodox schools under inspection were criticised for the quality of their secular education. ""

&gt; Almost all of them work among other people in the community. Almost all of them marry outside of their own close family

Not irrelevant - the other guy suggested that things were better in the Netherlands.

&gt;but objectively Id say they are more fair, and civilized than the current system

Civilized? Really? How is it fair that if an accident is caused by a cyclist, the motorist must pay half of the costs? 

It's a *ridiculous* rule.

&gt;Depends on how you look at it. Takes me 20 mins to cycle into the city, takes me 35 mins plus parking fees to drive.

Again, just an anecdote. Takes me 15 mins to drive into the city centre in rush hour. Takes about 25 mins to half an hour on a bike.

&gt;The issue governments face is not about ""making it harder"", its about giving people extra options outside getting stuck in traffic.

Yeah I don't have a problem with this. I'm all for providing people with more options. I just don't think that it's fair to ban motorists from city and town centres. I've already said this.

&gt;Those who insist (for whatever reason) on driving can continue todo so - those who feel public transport, walking or cycling should be encouraged todo so if only because it will be better for everyone (inc drivers).

Yeah, great.

&gt;What are you scared of? serious question, both the Netherlands and Copenhagen are some of the happiest countries on the planet. And their cities are some of the most ""livable"" in the world. Removing the car (for the most part) is something Iv never heard a negative thing about. 

We can't possibly know how much of an impact on happiness the removal of cars has had. It's a very different culture with things much closer together.

I'm not scared of anything, it just angers me that there are people out there who would remove my freedom to choose the method of transport that fits my life best, simply because they don't like it.

I don't understand why all methods of transport can't operate in harmony. 

&gt;And remember - no ones being anti car. Its possible to be pro (say public transport) without shitting on cars. 

No, /u/bead-maketh-the-man specifically said that there was nothing wrong with removing cars from town centres. That's what I have a problem with.

this is exactly what i mean, all the media push the whole 'muslim' thing in peoples faces telling them its because he's a muslim, shes a muslim ect. when it actual fact its just radicalisation within that religion, we've seen it all over the world, hitler killing jews based on their religion, the catholics and protestants so on and so forth. It happens all around the world, in different religions. My only point is that this has been thrown in peoples faces and forces them to make their own mind up just by reading one or two articles and not getting the whole story. 
Although with the lee rigby case those men defiantly thought that doing it for their religion was the right thing, not just for the people at home, (i could get quotes but it would just go on and on) 
As for the minority, within my local police force ive seen a lot more crimes being committed by muslim men, mainly drug trafficking, prostitution of woman, drug dealing and a few others. This is fact, there has been a rise in muslim men committing crime. The annoyance is on one side you see ""muslim man arrested for drugs"" then you see ""muslims demand a prayer room, or muslims demand not to touch meat at tills""
these headlines twist peoples views on all muslims and puts them 'all' in too categories they shouldnt be in.
its just the same as any other religion, you get scum bags and arseholes, its just that we see more of these people currently. And in the future it may be jews, catholics, buddhists ect. its just a vicious circle.

&gt;I wonder how many years we have to put up with your brothers murdering innocent people in the name of Islam before you'd admit that the only common denominator between these people is Islam.

I mean if you're really upset about Islam and think body count justifies your suspicion you must REALLY hate the Germans/French and Brits. 

It just shows how daft essentialist thinking like your is. See, my position woudl take into account all the social, economic and cultural factors. Look at the powers and analyise their history. See hwo we came to that situation. I would blame Hitler , but I would be aware of other factors such as the Wiemar republic, the treaty of Verssailes and everything else.

The King granted his request providing any formal engagement was delayed until Elizabeth's twenty-first birthday the following April.[4] Their engagement was officially announced on 9 July 1947.""

Next you will be saying that because I don't speak Arabic, I can't possibly understand Islam and it's beauty (lol). Choose any of the books above and I will show you a quote that shows Aisha was not 18 or 19. 

WWII was started predominantly because of the rise of Fascism in Germany. Do you think that fascism isn't a bad ideology? Or it is misunderstood? After all most fascists never killed a single person. Does that mean fascism is peaceful? 

All this crap about how it's not Islam's fault, it's just a coincidence that everywhere there are Muslims sees terrorism and murdering in Islam's name, is rubbish. It's not a coincidence that the Quran says to wage jihad, and that young men around the world will 'misinterpret' that to mean they should go out and fight in whatever way they can for Islam. 

If what you said lead to these murders and terrorist attacks really did lead to those things then where are the poor, uneducated, harmed-by-imperialism, Christians, Buddhists, Hindus and Sikhs murdering in the name of their religion? And more to the point where are the British Christians, Buddhists, Hindus and Sikhs committing terrorism on behalf of people of their faith elsewhere in the world? If they murdered at the rate that Muslims have in the last month, there would have been almost a thousand more murders!

It's basically your life over. What have you got to look forward to? He must be suicidal - I would be, even at less than half his age. Guilty or not, borderline cases or not - his life is effectively over. He can be named, the accusers can't - and he is not allowed to answer back publicly. It's torturous.

It's very sad for the victims if true - it's very sad for Rolf if not.

**If it's true**, and the cases are NOT borderline (as in NOT 14/15 year olds), then obviously he should be condemned and rightly so. Even in the liberal 60s and 70s you should have been able to empathise with the children and realise what you're putting them through, however many animals you've stroked on television since.

**If it's borderline cases only** (I know there is a 7/8 year old mentioned, but as we know it's all allegations as yet), then I have to say I feel sorry for Rolf (and others with similar borderline cases). Sometimes underage kids DO look well over the age limit, often on purpose. You can't ask them for ID even these days, and you certainly wouldn't have been able to back in those days. If girls are flinging themselves at you, and you're free and single and having an amazing career - how many of us would say no to those claiming to be over the age of consent? Would you be imagining this turning up 40 years later, when different standards, ideals and laws would retrospectively be applied to decade's old events?

**If it's all false**, then Rolf's career is still over, and for absolutely nothing. 60 years of career ruined, family ruined, a lifetime's memories and friendships ruined.

Sad times, whatever happens.

I won't try and assume anything about you other than the fact you seem to have called yourself a muslim. Just try and figure out why the media mainly, but also how other people have began to think of muslims.

Is it because of general muslim ideals? I'd go so far to say that it is. Religion is a huuuuuuuuuge tapestry of opinions. Basically your god apparently speaks to a whole load of people through scripture, and tells them a whoooooooooooole load of different things. INTERPRITATION. everything is an interpritation. even yours. so you interprate it one way, an extreemist interperts it the other. We're not worried about you, we're worried about them. But you both dress according to that book, talk out of that book, and live your life by that book. sure different interpretations, but how are we supposed to know.

LIVE YOUR LIFE HOW YOU WANT. but know that if a kid decides to be a goth, he WILL BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY. if a kid decideds to be a THUG GANGSTA, he will be treated differently. We ALL steriotype by the info we are given. We are mainly given info from the media. The media picks of the MOST EXTREME or the MOST CONTAVERTIAL or the MOST EASY target.

I hope all this sounds like a hate speach, with a twist of self loathing. Thats what i mean it to say. Hate towards a name. I hate the name GOTH I hate the name GANSTA, i hate the name CHRISTIAN and I hate the name MUSLIM. Please for the love of PEACE, beleve what you want in silence, in noname, in ""the personal"".

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"Im sorry, no. Direct quotes are meaningless unless you now what the isnad and silsilah is. The isnad is hisham bin Urwa . His student Muslim (of Sahih Muslim) actually says that hisham's Iraqi hadith are untrustworth , because his memory was gone. The hadith is Hisham quoting Ayesha quoting herself.  Because it was in Bukhari many muhaddith copied it. 

Now the problem is that other sources don't tally with those quotes. Aysha is also quoted in Tabari and Suyuti as saing she was a girl who understood things when the Quranic Ayat called Al Qmar was revealed. That's before Mohammad married her - 9 year BEFORE she married him.  That hadith is unquestioned. No ropey sources. 

Ibn Kathir says Asma , Aysha's older sister was 10 years older. Asma died 73 years after the flight from Mecca and her was on record as around 100 give or take a year. So if you do the math she's 27 years old when they run from Mecca. That makes Aysha 17/16 at that time. 

Also Ibn Kathir, Tabbari and others also report that she was the Battles of Badr and Uhud. Mohammad banned anyone who was below the age of 15 from the combat zone. That means she must have been older. 

Last one Ahmad Ibn Hambal ( who's one of the most senior clerics of all time) says that when Mohammad was asked if he wanted to marry, he was offered a woman who was ""Bikr"". In Arabic ""Bikr"" is a woman who is past puberty and a virgin. 

So there's is vast source of evidence that suggest that she wasn't a little girl. No why did some scholars decide to be reticent over this - well that's because of good old inter-sect politics during the Abbasid period but I won't bore your with details. Suffice to say some clerics wanted to prove a point about Ayesha and ended up pushing Hisham bi Urwa's hadiths in the 8th century. It thus entered the jurisprudence for some people. 


Now onto your other ""arguments"". 

If you're going to turn around and say that Islam, all of it, from year 1 to year 1400 is responsible for the terrorism that you see then Western civilisation - all of it - has to account for fascism. 

Again, I can account for Facism as a complex phenomena that appeared due to the interaction of history, social movements and economics at the time. Because I believe that these are some of the causes of social movements and ideologies all over the world that can result in extremism. 

My analysys works when you look at the Tamil Tigers ( hindu) , th Shiv Senna ( hindu), the recent Bhuddist anti-rohingya violence in Burma, the Bhuddist component of the Japanese ideology that drove its nationalism in WW2, the Sikh Khalsa movement that fought  a long running campaign against the Indian government which led to the downing of an Air India plane (allegedly) and there's always the Pogroms and the Crusades. 

Yours only works with one occurance. Mine works with many more. You  way of expaining the world and thus explaining Islam only works if you insist that there is no violence in the name of other religions or ideologies except Islam. 

If there is just one incidence of violence motivated by religion that isn't Islam then you analysis falls apart.

true,ProtoKun7,smith,Smith,"&gt;First, why did River have to (sort of) die to free the people in the database? Tennant explained it, but he spoke so fast I couldn't hear a word. (I'm also American, and it can be hard enough to understand his accent normally.)

Someone had to use their mind as a buffer; to provide extra memory to bring everyone out. River took the Doctor's place so he could live.

&gt;Second, River spoke about singing towers and the Doctor realizing he needed to tell River his name for some reason as well as give her a screwdriver we haven't seen him use yet. This episode hasn't happened yet. Is there any indication that this will be in the Christmas Special?

Not to my knowledge. There doesn't seem to be an indication it will appear in an episode either; in *Last Night*, a mini episode in the extra features for series 6, his future version was on the way to the Singing Towers with her. I also don't think the screwdriver she had was ever his primary one, but rather one reminiscent of his design that had been made for her. By *The Name of the Doctor*, it was implied (or at least I inferred) that most if not all of the Doctor's interaction with River Song had happened by that point.

&gt;Third, what happened to the Vashta Nerada? They haven't appeared again, did he do something to keep them in the libraray? I didn't understand most of his conversation with the ghosting Anita, where she let him go giving him one day to do something.

As far as I know, they're still in the Library, which is now abandoned.

&gt;Fourth, the whole ""hunt in forests"" thing is confusing. This story made it seem like the Nerada were in every dark space in the universe, and that's why every species is scared of the dark. But later on he clarifies that they hunt in forests. So which is it? Dark forests, or dark only?

They don't exist in every dark space, but they can potentially be in *any* dark space, with no way to know which. It's just that usually they are in lower concentrations and so don't appear nearly as ravenous, only feeding on the occasional animal that might come their way, or the occasional missing person.",0,1387842096,null,0,false,0,ce8trem,t3_1tk3z9,t1_ce8trem,t3_1tk3z9,null,1428010306,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

How are you so certain I'm just imagining things because other people said it? Sounds like a lot of assumptions. 

There are lots of examples if you look carefully at the matches. He was actively trying to construct more inclusive plays, being a focal point as a team leader not just the biggest offensive talent. He has made passes like his recent assist for Sterling. His handing off of the armband to Agger.

&gt;Again, just an anecdote. Takes me 15 mins to drive into the city centre in rush hour. Takes about 25 mins to half an hour on a bike.

Sure - and I was replying to your comment about a bike being slow. It all depends on your situation. Pretty obvious. But I can say with little doubt a bike is quicker in built up congested/rush hour areas. And on the oposite end of the spectrum you wouldnt expect a bike to beat a car on the open road or over a long distances.

But everything depends on the way the town/city is layed out and the  amount of traffic on a particular route - there is not definitive right or wrong answer.


&gt;I just don't think that it's fair to ban motorists from city and town centres

Why?...Plenty of cities (inc Norwich where I am) have pedestrianised areas where (for the most part) cars cannot go. People park outside and walk in, use the park and ride (a bus ever 20 mins) etc. 




&gt;it just angers me that there are people out there who would remove my freedom to choose the method of transport that fits my life best, simply because they don't like it.

You are reading way to much into this you know. No ones forcing you todo anything. 

&gt;I don't understand why all methods of transport can't operate in harmony.

I wish they would too. Unfortunatly we are talking about the effects (social and environmental) of the car, and car infrastructure. Not to much about other forms of transport.




&gt;specifically said that there was nothing wrong with removing cars from town centres. That's what I have a problem with.

Tell me - do you want more cars on the road? Do you think people like shopping surrounded by cars in built up busy streets?

And do you think people like to fight for every parking space just to get to the highstreet?



&gt;Sure thing. More cycle lanes, more places to cross, better traffic management.

true,HannibalAntePortas,null,null,"Just because something is old doesn't mean that it is useless or worn out. While it is not the en voge 4-2-3-1, the 4-4-2 does offer quite a bit of tactical variety. To say otherwise belies a general lack of football tactical knowledge. Depending on the movement and team setup, overloads can be created on opposition center backs and fullbacks with ease. Space can be created by forcing the center backs to play narrowly and thus opening up passing lanes inside the fullbacks or it forces the fullbacks to pinch in and thus leaves open space on the outside for runs and crosses. As a team attacks the shape can turn into a 3-5-2 with a more defensive minded/ball playing midfielder dropping between the center backs and freeing the outside backs to press high once the balls been turned over. It also allows for an easy switch to the 4-2-3-1 or the 4-3-3 with just a shape change or a sub. The two forwards also opens up counter attacking opportunities that are more difficult to create in a one forward setup. For proof look at Ade's first goal from the Soldado cross. Spurs have been excruciatingly slow getting out of their own end all year in the 4-2-3-1. Yesterday, Spurs were able to counter quickly and score from 3 passes from Lamela to Ade to Soldado to Ade for the goal. While there may be more space between the lines in a 4-4-2 defensively, there are benefits such as having more outlet options to alleviate pressure in addition to the fast counter-attack. Depending on how play is being dictated the extra man in the midfield may have to drop more to help cover up a forward. The 4-2-3-1 is not inherently better than the 4-4-2, nor is the 4-4-2 inherently better than the 4-2-3-1 or the 4-3-3. The game of football is not as simplistic as that.

He has coached the youth to great success which means he can (hopefully) see potential and get the most out of players and judging from the Bentaleb sub he's pretty tactically aware... I think he's great!

If she complained to someone in head office, particularly HR, they would take it very seriously (probably the only instance where our current litigation culture is actually a good thing)

Is there anyone else on the team that feels the same way and would be willing to make a statement about this particular manager? Obviously it would work a lot better coming from more than one person.

AFAIK, UK employment laws make it nigh-on impossible to straight-up fire someone for anything except gross misconduct. If your mum made a complaint there's no way the company (or the manager in question) would be able to fire her. They would be in court so fast for unfair dismissal it'd make their heads spin. Of course it might make things more difficult for her post-complaint if she needs to work with the manager again - though it could go the other way and he/she starts treading on eggshells around her for fear of a followup complaint and maybe then dismissal.

You can absolutely complain yourself, and it will probably receive attention, although to be honest it would be difficult to remain anonymous for your mum's sake (if she doesn't work with customers, it won't be one of those complaining) so she may as well make the complaint herself.

She should absolutely take action though.

I'm not going to accept evidence on Mohammaed from Baron Bodissey and Robert Spencer. I have more than enough knowledge from my own research and countless scholars who have given us the evidence as I have given it to you. You choose to make you judgements I choose to make mine 

However, you don't seem to be able to grasp the basic problem with all this. Try to understand this very carefully: 

When we do things as researchers and social scientists we have certain things to take into account: a) we don't work off generalisations unless we can prove every instance of them and b) we stay away from simple answers. 

You have some severe problems with your viewpoint a) your generalisations aren't provable in EVERY instance and b) you endorse simmple answers while running away from complex ones. 

Oh and you don't seem to know how to read statistics: 

&gt;All I need to know is that Pakistanis, who account for about 3-5% of the population, account for 1/3 of genetic abnormalities at birth. And I said ban first cousin marriage. Not second cousins once removed.

This isn't want the report says. it had a sample size of 11,000 children, born out of consanguineous marriages, revealed congenital anomalies in 386 of them. That's a figure of 3 per cent. Non-consanguineous marriages have rate of 1.6 per cent .

Let's do that maths. If you're married to a first cousin your probability of having birth defects in your child is 3 out of 100. If you don't it's 1.6 out of 100. Fair enough, it's double the rate.  But it's not as you describe it.

my point was accurate considering the post got down votes despite those people not expressing their disagreements. It was as I stated, they read the titled and down-voted...which I can understand.

the fact is people get confused, in attempting to point out this fact especially in relation to unusual and complex ideas, it's intellectually dishonest to state that somehow you are being patronising and attempting to say 'your' ideas are above others.

2. Yes SAF reign is over so there is bigger chance for Liverpool(and other teams) to finish top four. BR has built(and is building) a young talent full team playing exciting football, but I still think we are lacking in depth and it could be costly if we loose more players to injury(with Suarez and Sturridge gone we could be in deep trouble).
3. I think realistically we have a decent chance of reaching top four as we are continually winning mid and lower table teams.BR tactics and team selections have been impressive(especially last 5 games) and individually each player has played well above average.I am also glad to see we seem to be copying well without Gerrard.

We will see in next 2 games what Liverpool is made off.

Well, they are going overseas for lots of reasons as I said above - the marketplace for private services is very limited, the costs are relatively high in part because the industry is underdeveloped and most resources are already prioritized for the NHS and because the law does not allow for some services to run in the UK.

Listened to the first half on the radio, and watched the second half in a pub.

What a game, defense on corners looked substantially better from what I got to see. Willian was a crazy runner but it was unfortunate to see him unable to finish. Team looked really reinvigorated.

Game seems like it could have been a 2-0 or 1-0 win pending some better finishing (Willian) / luck (Lampard's volley). Or 1-1 if you're pragmatic.

Say you meet yourself from ten years in the future.  The two of you talk about old times and new times and in that discussion you find out that you don't like what you will become and decide to change those things.  The future version of yourself goes back and you have a completely different outlook on life and everything goes hunky doory up till the point ten years later that you do not have access to the Time Machine that brought you a glimpse into the future.  Having now never gone back in time to see you, there was no reason to change how you live your life.  In doing so everything that you know unravels and just continues to loop from this point.  

Clear as Mud?  Good, I did my job.  

Now, say the Doctor meets a future version of himself and finds out how he is going to die that will end up becoming his next regeneration.  In doing so he figures that he is not going to go to that Planet, Place, Time, or Restaurant and never regenerates.

&gt; First, the makers are not driving growth.

&gt; Fourth, inventory build-up and household consumption drove UK real GDP growth in the third-quarter 2013. Neither is sustainable.

&gt; Fifth, for all the talk about re-balancing the British economy, the latest data confirms what we have been seeing for some quarter now.

&gt; That is, a return to the sort of growth drivers that were present before the crisis. Which means one thing: the current growth will not be sustainable unless there are significant changes in the composition of final expenditure in the UK.

The author is a [post-Keynesian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Monetary_Theory) economist who (by my understanding) believes that boosting household savings rates would lead to more sustainable growth, and that the *only* way this can be achieved is by deficits run by the currency issuer.

It's more of a fact than a claim that I'm Irish, we keep pretty good books over here.  Actually turns out County Mayo kept decent books too as my family verified our ancestry back in the 90s.  I'm proud to say I've come from a rich working class background and proud to support Liverpool which was itself a blue collar city for their glory years.

It's more like 12% than ""a large portion"".  To give you some perspective 12% is about the same as the African American population in the US and coming in poor as hell because of that whole human rights fiasco of some heartless royalty intentionally holding off support (which ended up hurting every local economy, karma can be a bitch) We started at about the same level as newly freed slaves. Luckily, yet disgustingly, being white the Irish were able to pull themselves into the middle class.

Congratulations for being the only negative nancy on this entire thread.  

A final thought, I luckily don't judge Liverpool because you're being awkwardly negative.  I really don't have leg to stand on as a brand new fan to the club who accidentally, although happily, joined at the top of the table early in the season.  Just try to be a bit nicer and less quick to seek out a negative proclamation.

That's one loss to the potential title contenders, with Liverpool soon ( with Suarez in god mode).

If we can start to pick up momentum in the other games we stand a really good chance of succeeding this season. Not bad for Jose's first year with ALOT of young players to teach.

While this statement is true, it doesn't address /u/miniguy's point. We are using stockpiles of weapons grade plutonium from decommissioned nuclear warheads to make mixed-oxide fuel as a substitute for enriched uranium. /u/miniguy was referring to the stockpiles of uranium-238 in spent fuel and depleted uranium. As far as I know, no one is using that uranium, and it makes up the vast majority of nuclear ""waste"" (&gt;95%). Only fast breeder reactors can burn uranium-238, and only Russia has a commercial fast breeder reactor.

&gt;to make up for the shortfall in uranium mine production.

Given the current abundance of uranium, I suspect the real reason we are using MOX fuel is not because there isn't enough uranium, but rather because it is economically competitive or cheaper than enriching uranium (i.e. increasing its fissile ratio). Enriching uranium is expensive, and one of the benefits of MOX fuel is that it is very easy and inexpensive to increase its fissile ratio.

 Footballing wise...

true,Jhar,null,null,"Why I'm not happy with this:

I'm a big AVB fan. Mock the tactics and choices all you want, he shook things up at Spurs. I don't believe that the team had completely settled with way he wanted to play, either, and would have liked to seen it truly come together. I was interested in what the team could achieve with AVB, and now I'll never know. 

I think AVB would certainly get youth players involved when they could be called upon; he's used Kane and Fryers already this season. The problem is trying to integrate all the new/returning players while keeping the youth reserves in the picture. Like you pointed out, if Sherwood happens to be no good he'll be ousted, but if that's the outcome then that's the same as the assumed path we were headed with AVB. 

I don't like the general 'fire the manager' mentality when things aren't going the way the board wants them to, as if it's the cure-all for everything going wrong. Firing the manager without having a replacement already lined up doesn't show too much foresight, and I thought giving Redknapp the boot was signalling a new direction for the club with long term goals.

You say that at the end of the day we got 3 points and played entertaining football; we were scraping results with AVB so the only difference is the way we're playing. And while you may say entertaining, I would call it exciting instead. It's more open, but it's not as controlled. Exciting in a nervy, heart-attack inducing way isn't always a good thing. Obviously this opinion isn't based on much, so we'll have to see. Doesn't seem like AVB got much of that though. I think the team had a transition year last season, and was still going through that transition when AVB was shown the door. I would say let the football be entertaining after we've filled the ambition of qualifying for the Champions' League, but work on that objective first.",0,1387866598,null,0,false,0,ce92uqf,t3_1tk1v9,t1_ce92uqf,t1_ce8rla9,null,1428005991,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

true,lxcoon,null,null,"At the end of season 5 episode 12 when the doctor is being put in the pandorica both the cyberman and the dalek give some pretty useful information.  First the cyberman says ""All projections correlate, all evidence concurs.  The Doctor will destroy the Universe.""  then further in the conversation the dalek says ""The cracks in time are the work of the Doctor"" to which the doctor responds ""Not me, the TARDIS and I'm not in the TARDIS am I?""  To which the dalek says ""Only the Doctor can pilot the TARDIS.""

These two little tid bits have led me to believe that the Doctor (most likely 12 or an older 11) is the ""external force"" piloting the TARDIS and the explosion was created on purpose.**   Since the Dalek says that the cracks in time are the work of the doctor it stands to reason that it was all on purpose.  The explosion of the TARDIS which creates the cracks that lead to the exploding TARDIS.

**Inside the TARDIS when River loses control of it a voice says ""Silence will fall"", I think that these have been the Doctor's words all along.  It doesn't sound like the voice of the doctor so I could be wrong but it also could be a very sinister sort of ""fuzzy radio"" thing of Capaldi's voice.  If it is I will be truly impressed.  Unlikely though.

So what is it that the Doctor hoped to accomplish by creating the cracks and then exploding the TARDIS to fix the damage?  Why would he need to ""reboot"" the universe?  Maybe this has something to do with Gallifrey?

No matter what, all of this is linked to 26/06/2010.  This is the date the Doctor avoided and is also the day right before Rory and Amy's wedding.  Because Amy had to remember the Doctor to bring him back it is very possible that that night, between River visiting and going through Amy's room and the TARDIS showing up on the dance floor at the wedding, the Doctor might not have existed at all, only in the universe that was destroyed.  What was he doing/where was he?

The other significant thing about that date is that the night after in the TARDIS, Melody Pond was conceived.  This is another thing that Moffat says will be resolved in the episode, we'll get to find out why/how the silence needed/got River Song (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WggIxAUkF4Y).  As far as I'm concerned, the events of series 6 and 7 all revolve around that day.

River somehow got to the wedding to drop off the diary for Amy to remember before she even ""brought him back"" so that might suggest the Doctor existed already and dropped river off, or crossed his time stream and dropped her off later on (paradox).

I was in London for the day, meant to get the 22:18 train to Guildford to hop off on a stop half way down the line, but by 23:30, it was cancelled and another one had been set up. There were *hundreds* of people (and a full platform of trains) stranded at Waterloo, but Network Rail didn't want to move any of them. Guildford was so packed with stranded passengers that they didn't want to add to the situation there. The biggest travesty was that everywhere that sold beer had just closed.

Finally got on a China rush-hour level packed train to Guildford about quarter to midnight which made it all the way to Surbiton before the driver was forced to stop and came over the tannoy to announce that there were trees down all over the line and they could only go direct to Woking and Guildford - no good for me.

I hopped off at Surbiton - where I joined another hundred or so displaced people. Apparently the weather had knocked out the power for most of the station, so it was lit by electronic camping lamps and staff with torches. There were a few cabs out front, but nowhere near enough to cope with how many people were there

Fortunately a very understanding friend in a 4x4 braved the weather to came to pick me up.

On the thirty minute 1am drive from Surbiton at back to my little suburb, we pulled over three times to get out and move fallen trees out the way. Once we got out of Surbiton, there was flash-flood depths of water on most roads, and a quarter-inch layer of dirt and debris on the rest. If we didn't have a 4x4 we probably would have been stranded.

It might well be a spot of bad weather, but a lot of people are still stuck waiting for the rail networks to be cleared so they can get home for Christmas.",0,1387869392,null,0,false,0,ce93me1,t3_1tjb2q,t1_ce93me1,t1_ce8tn1q,null,1428005633,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

If she does that, and makes it very clear that she has the support of the union and a diary of written evidence it will be very unlikely that she'd lose her job, as HR should make it abundantly clear to the bullying manager that any action like that would result in *his* dismissal.

That is because we play with a double pivot (or more fluid midfield), where roles are split based on position on the pitch and not based on assigned roles (eg. defensive/attacking).

In these modern formations all midfielders are defensive midfielders, all midfielders are attacking midfielders, all midfielders are 'destroyers' and all midfielders need to be able to distribute.

They are more special rounded type of players and are difficult to purchase, you need to breed them yourself (there are more teams that want to play like this then there are players who can fill these spots - Juve, Real Madrid, etc.)

Yes I do.

*A form of strict liability has been supported in law in the Netherlands since the early 1990s for bicycle-motor vehicle accidents.[6] In a nutshell, this means that, in a collision between a car and a cyclist, the driver is deemed to be liable to pay damages and his insurer (n.b. motor vehicle insurance is mandatory in the Netherlands, while cyclist insurance is not) must pay the full damages, as long as 1) the cyclist did not intentionally crash into the motor vehicle, and 2) the cyclist was not in error in some way.[6] If the cyclist was in error, as long as the collision was still unintentional, the motorist's insurance must still pay half of the damages ‚Äî though this doesn't apply if the cyclist is under 14 years of age, in which case the motorist must pay full damages.[6] If it can be proved that a cyclist intended to collide with the car, then the cyclist must pay the damages (or his/her parents in the case of a minor.)[6]*

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_in_the_Netherlands

&gt;But everything depends on the way the town/city is layed out and the amount of traffic on a particular route - there is not definitive right or wrong answer.

Exactly, which is why people should be able to choose.

&gt;Why?...Plenty of cities (inc Norwich where I am) have pedestrianised areas where (for the most part) cars cannot go. People park outside and walk in, use the park and ride (a bus ever 20 mins) etc. 

Yes, pedestrianized areas are fine.

&gt;You are reading way to much into this you know. No ones forcing you todo anything.

Obviously not. This is a hypothetical situation...

&gt;I wish they would too. Unfortunatly we are talking about the effects (social and environmental) of the car, and car infrastructure. Not to much about other forms of transport.

What's the point in talking about it in isolation?

&gt;And do you think people like to fight for every parking space just to get to the highstreet?

No, I think there should be more parking in town centres.

""Sale of Alcohol to a Person who is Drunk

Section 141 makes it an offence to sell or attempt to sell alcohol to a person who is drunk, or to allow alcohol to be sold to such a person on relevant premises.

Subsection 2 applies to:

    any person who works at the premises in a capacity, whether paid or unpaid, which gives him the authority to sell the alcohol concerned;
    the holder of a premises licence in respect of the premises;
    the designated premises supervisor (if any) under such a licence;
    any member or officer of the club which holds a certificate who at the time the sale (or attempted sale) takes place is present on the premises in a capacity which enables him to prevent it; and
    the premises user in relation to the temporary event notice in question.

This section applies in relation to the supply of alcohol by or on behalf of a club to or to the order of a member of the club as it applies in relation to the sale of alcohol.

A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale. ""

The greatest night in the club's history was the 26th May 1982 when we won the European Cup (now known as the Champions league). Only five English clubs have ever won this.

* RB/LB: Right now the Montoya link seems dead in the water, and not much has come in the way of full back rumours. I think a surprise is in store.

* Backup CF: As of now the only consistent rumour has been Kostas Mitroglou, but from whatever little I've seen of him he doesn't seem like the kind of player that would play Rodgers' style of football. 

* Defensive Mid: All sorts of players have been linked for this postion, but the main ones are M'Vila and Fernando Reges. However, Rubin Kazan fired their Director of Football and manager last week, so the M'Vila link seems dead for now.
