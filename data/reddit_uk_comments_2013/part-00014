But if you're resorting to baton, you've exhausted all preferable options, Tactical communication or PAVA/CS, . Hitting someone on the arm or leg with the baton, is still going to do far more damage than a taser generally would. Blunt force will also have a lasting effect, bruising, broken bones, nerve damage. A taser, on a normal person, would not leave marks, or have any lasting damage. Most people that have taser used on them are fine, seconds after the voltage leaves them.

You can't even argue that a taser is more likely to kill, because...quite frankly, it isn't if used properly, as with a baton.

I have no doubt this is true though, Didier spoke about texting Jose after his 'slide' and the other details about his personal life are accurate.

The declining physical attributes of Lampard were clear to see, Romeu was still unproven, Mikel had been solid last season but the old flaws still remained while Ramires played more of a starring role from the RW not CM. As I discussed with you some time ago there was a lot going on in the Summer, I'm inclined to believe that we missed out on a target late on, so we were thin on the ground from the get go

We recouped a lot of the Meireles investment while Essien has the chance to regain some fitness in a less physical league and/or put himself in the shop window, close to Â£200k a week off the wage bill too. I'm hoping it was Fellaini we missed out on, something we should be looking to rectify. I still have a huge problem with the lack of physicality and incisiveness from midfield, we were better against Arsenal but all too often this season we see the midfield pondering on the ball and slowing down play, it gives the opposition too much time to rebuild their lines therein crowding out Torres and removing a lot of space for our attacking trio to run in to. Something people often forget is that Torres isn't the only one who craves open field to run in to, Mata, Hazard, Oscar, Moses and Marin would all benefit from it too.

She begins self-centered and abrasive, but quickly becomes one of the most real and most humble companions the show's ever had. She's so incredibly normal. She's not some super-genius flirty twenty-something. She's a middle-aged temp from Chiswick with a bit of an attitude.

Moreover her and Tennant had *superb* chemistry. They made a duo that bounced off of each other flawlessly with amazing banter. You could honestly tell that those actors just *clicked*. It also helps that Tate was a *very* capable actress who was able to sell both the hilarious and tragic sequences flawlessly.

It's also a massive boon that she wasn't just some would-be love interest pining for the Doctor begging for a kiss. Unlike Rose, Martha, Amy, River, and Clara (a sadly long list) her relationship with the Doctor was platonic and she was independent of the Doctor in many ways.

true,acuteindifference,1905,Super Frank,"Thank you. I've been so frustrated by arguments along the lines of 'Torres has Mata, Hazard and Oscar behind him and he still can't score'. He hasn't exactly been playing well, to be fair, but we can't blame all our problems on him.

Personally, I feel our biggest weaknesses are:

* We are too narrow. You talked about pass-pass-pass like Barca but we are not even close to their level by any stretch (yet). Plus, they dominate possession so heavily that they can afford to play Dani Alves basically as a winger and they switch play incredibly quickly out to the wings. We have no such luxuries.

* We are too predictable. Rafa is a teeny bit better but we're still suffering from this problem like we were under RDM. We only ever make like-for-like subs. We have no impact subs (or we don't use them effectively enough). We never change our system even slightly even if we're losing to QPR at home. If you're already losing with 10 minutes to go, why not throw caution to the wind, take off a defensive player and put in an attacking one? 

* Mata, Hazard and Oscar can't play together yet. It limits us too much. They're too similar and when they play together, its either a goal fest or nothing at all. And it exposes us defensively, specially down the wings.We NEED alternative options. Moses was nearly perfect and we'll sorely miss him. Can't wait till he's back. And I absolutely agree that Marin should be given more game time. He's a natural wide player, he takes on defenders and causes havoc in the opposition penalty area. He brings a more direct threat to our attack. And he's a hard worker. He just needs game time and he could be a more than decent squad player for us at the very least.  

* I think we're not getting the best out of Hazard at the moment. He's incredibly talented. We should try getting him to play as a proper winger instead of a wide creative player. I think he'd rip defenses to shreds if he develops as a winger. Hazard had an excellent game against Arsenal because they play a very open game. Against teams that are more solid, we've often struggled to create chances.

true,rihd,null,null,"Pretty much, yes. But even standardised tests are there to make sure you meet minimum requirements, I think. I'm not sure what curriculum you're following, but 6/7 or 5s in IBs/APs in relevant subjects (maths, physics, chemistry etc.) are usually a necessity. 

They actually don't see your school grades, and extracurriculars aren't going to be a deciding factor for whether you get in. That said, they aren't meaningless either: good grades will likely get you a better reference, which is slightly more valued by admissions. And you said, extracurriculars that show you meet the selection criteria (see below) may help. They're also likely to be talked about in interviews (maybe just as an icebreaker, but I had questions based on what I wrote in my personal statement).

Selection criteria for physics, taken from their departmental website:

&gt;* Motivation: a real interest and strong desire to learn physics.
&gt;* Ability to express physical ideas using mathematics; mathematical ability.
&gt;* Reasoning ability: ability to analyse and solve problems using logical and critical approaches.
&gt;* Physical intuition: an ability to see how one part of a physical system connects with another; and to predict what will happen in a given physical situation.
&gt;* Communication: ability to give precise explanations both orally and numerical
&gt;
&gt;Candidates are selected primarily for interview on the basis of performance in the Physics Aptitude Test and assessed against the selection criteria above.

Do note that I don't have any particular insight into the process, and certainly not for physics. 

I suggest you check this site out, if you haven't already:

The Doctor see's his Tardis as being his companion and the only one he can really trust. She shows him beauty, takes him to new worlds, and cares for him as a wife would. He is practically married to it and if it weren't for River and if the Tardis could have remained a woman I dare say he would have married her lol.

He is always referring to the Tardis as a temperamental woman he enjoys living with and knows he can't do without. He calls her names like Sexy and I think darling or something similar once too. River knows the Tardis is female as well. That's why men don't cosplay as the Tardis they respect her for what she is :)

She was the most important woman in all of creation, then gets to travel around as a human-timelord producing ideas no one could have possibly dreamed of. Then, at the happiest moment of her life, she gets her memory removed by her best friend, and she knew it had to happen. She gets dropped off, and her last words are, ""yeah, see ya."" Both being funny and depressing is quite difficult to press onto certain fans that would rather see only one, especially is such a short amount of time. We only get to see her in a season and an episode, so she doesn't really get too much time to pull of such a large character. For the fans that only want happy or sad, they only get about half the episodes of one season. Also, they have to deal with the other, ""annoying,"" side of this character. Some people, though, love her because she makes you laugh, then ten seconds later makes you cry your eyes out. For some people, that's the absolute best kind of character in the world.

When paying penalty notices for disorder (PNDs), no admission of guilt is required. Paying the PND involves neither an official finding nor an acceptance of guilt and discharges all liability to conviction for the offence. PNDs for recordable offences are recorded on the Police National Computer however and may be disclosed on an Enhanced Criminal Records Disclosure issued by the Criminal Records Bureau, if it is concluded that the behaviour leading to the PND was relevant to the matter at hand, for example the applicantâs suitability to work with children. However, the mere fact that a PND has been issued would not make it relevant.

PNDs are generally issued to first-time offenders with no previous record.

Speaking as a family however.  It'd be tough.  Our car is provided by Motability and paid for with my wife's DLA mobility allowance.  The payment covers everything apart from fuel costs.  Getting rid of it would leave my wife struggling to go anywhere, a combination of non 'kneeling' buses and non-raised curbs makes getting her and her wheelchair on and off a knightmare, and it would be quicker to push her the 2 miles to our Doctors than it would to catch the two buses we'd need, but obviously in weather like what we've got currently trying to push a wheelchair through snow or over slick ice is a non-starter.  

A few years ago thanks to a combination of the DWP being behind in processing paperwork and a lack of funds on our part we went without a car for six months and it was damn hard work.  Even simple stuff like going to the beach for some fish and chips would involve military style planning to get everyone ready, on and off the bus and the back at the bus stop to get home before the seafront closed for the night.

You'd think that every single Australian grew up knowing that, if you got caught, you WILL BE EXECUTED if you bring drugs in or out of these countries.

New season with Victory, who fit his style a lot more (quick pacy, play it to the front quick/start from the back) and he has had a cracking season.

To compare him to sterling, I feel he has more tricks and doesn't necessarily rely on 1 or 2 moves, but not sure how that will go up against much better and organised defenses. He tends to rely being able to beat 1 man then getting a lot of space. I don't think he is as quick though.

He told me to start there too and i am a Biiig fan now. 

You may wonder now: why should I start in the middle of the show? 
Well if you watch new who you Will start in the middle of the story anyway since doctor who is on tv for 50 years now. 
Another fact I figured out is that it doesnt matter where you start in a series as long as you watch episodes a a logical order. So if you start at matt smiths seasons you still dont know what happened before and if you go back later it is like the story was meant to be told like that and you can still enjoy it.
Also but that is just my opinion i found season one not soooooo entrtaining.
So to come to the main subject again. I reccommend watching it from season 5 to 6 and stat over at season 1 then. I did it like that and had a great time plus matt smith is a GREAT Doctor.

To be fair, it's not just woman that get abuse, especially when touching on subjects such as immigration.

She's being abused by the kind of people that want all immigrants kicked out at best, xenophobic racist bigoted knuckle draggers.  These kind of people will use any leverage in an attack.  If she was black, she'd be called a ""nigger"" and have abuse about going ""back to your own country"".  If she was Asian, she's be called a ""Pakki"" regardless of if she was Pakistani.  If she was fat, she'd be ripped into for that etc etc etc

This is how knuckle draggers work, they use their impotent rage to go for the weak spot

Two scenarios could come about in our lifetime:

a) The separation of Northern Ireland as an independent country
 
This is total economic suicide, Northern Ireland has absolutely no natural resources to fall back on (other than Tourism) and we'd need to get used to effectively living in poverty.  Even if we were to reduce the corporation tax to 0% as a sovereign country, we still wouldn't have enough skilled labor to support an economic recovery to the levels we're used to as part of the UK

b) Merging of Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland

Again, the Republic of Ireland is on it's knees economically after receiving billions from Europe in subsidies.  If we were to merge with the Republic, Northern Ireland wouldn't get any special dispensation economically and we would be in a much worse situation than we are now.

It would be a wonderful scenario whereby Ireland is united, however that's not likely to occur anytime soon.  It was at it's closest economically in 2005-2007 and will probably be at it's closest politically when and if Scotland separates.

If they're not working there they don't need to live thre.

&gt; Sure, we could strangle our biggest economic engine 

We're talking about people who aren't working, so they aren't part of the engine. More like the brake system.

&gt;  force poor people out of the capital 

We're forcing the non working poor out of the capital. The working poor already can't afford to live there without housing benefit because housing benefit has pushed up rents.

&gt;  just to satisfy the chip on your shoulder

It's nothing to do with that. We're spending a lot of money making people who could work idle and pushing up rents to the point that the working poor cannot afford them.

I.e. the problem is that state spending is making things worse than they would be without it. It's actually a much deeper problem than the deficit.

&gt;  but look how well that worked in Paris.

I don't see why paying people with no job a fortune to live in a nice area benefits anyone frankly. Look at the riots - because London has bad and good areas so mixed up it was much harder to police than Paris where they can just seal off the suburbs.

In fact a cap wouldn't really affect this. You'd still have council housing - an an overwhelming majority of rioters live in council hosing

http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/tenancies/report-blames-design-of-social-housing-for-riots/6518212.article

&gt; Consultancy firm Space Syntax conducted research into 12 town centres in north and south London which were hit by rioters in August.
&gt;
&gt; In north London, the research showed that 84 per cent of rioting took place in town centres within a five minute walk of housing estates. In south London the figure jumped to 96 per cent.
&gt;
&gt; Of those town centres in both north and south London which are not close to housing estates, 75 per cent were not hit by rioting.
&gt;
&gt; Researchers said that the location of social housing and areas where rioting took place are linked but more through the design of estates.
&gt;
&gt; The report said: âMost post-war housing estates have been designed in such a way that they create over-complex, and as a result, under-used spaces.
&gt;
&gt; âThese spaces are populated by large groups of unsupervised children and teenagers, where peer socialisation can occur between them without the influence of adults.
&gt;
&gt; âThis pattern of activity, and the segregation of user groups, is not found in non-estate street networks.â
&gt;
&gt; The report also said that analysis of court records shows that almost three quarters of convicted rioters in the study areas live on large post-war housing estates.

A cap on housing benefit is going to change this. Mind you a right to buy might. Look at that last figure ~ 75% of rioters live in council housing. 

Once again we're spending a fortune creating ghettos that need not exist. If we had right to buy people would borrow the money, buy their houses, do them up and then sell them. The area would be gentrified and would not produce rioters because it would not produce feral children.

true,mr-mistoffelees,cnty-wales,Wales,"Ok, you need to register for Self Assessment. You can register online, and complete the SA online. When did you start your freelance work?

It's essentially very simple. At the end of the tax year, you'll receive a P60 from your employer. This will detail what they've paid you, and deductions they've made.

You'll then need all of your self employment stuff - what you've paid out, what you've invoiced. Pop all of the figures into the Self Assessment site and it'll tell you how much you owe. Bosh.

Edit: Or, if you prefer, you can get an accountant to do it. I personally do my own, but my aunt is an accountant. She charges 500 quid for this kind of thing if you bring all of your paperwork in a huge mess in a carrier bag (no, really, this is how builders et al typically work, it seems). It's a bit less if you're properly organised.

Edit2: Quick trick. If you complete your Self Assessment before the end of December (so, for the financial year 12/13, you'd complete it before 31 December 2013), you'll be able to opt to have any tax that you owe deducted at source from your PAYE employment.

Firstly, your last statement, the UVF pulling too many strings? Come on man, you know yourself this is not true. You're not inspiring a great discussion here if your own opening statement already puts across a bias.

Secondly, these are not the London riots. People keep comparing them  as if they are a legitimate cross comparison. They're not. At all. Seriously. Come on. 

The riots in England were not just in London, they were nationwide, in a setting were nothing like this happens regularity and the general public by a overwhelming margin disagreed with what the rioters were doing. Huge public outcry against the looting, the damage done, more than enough video evidence of people doing ridiculous things for no cause whatsoever.

Now, these protests going on over here right now, they are fucked up, and I hate them. I think the people standing at these protests can go fuck themselves. Comparing them to the scale of the 2011 however. No. 

Seriously go look over the scale and size of the 2011 riots in England. 5 dead, dozens injured, millions looted.

It was not the same. Also, the PSNI can not arrest everyone in these protests. Why? Imagine you arrest everyone at a protest. You clear the roads, traffic goes fine, no one has to look at these ugly dicks again. Paradise yea?

No, you've just fucked off every single loyalist in the country, inspiring all the sofa unionists to get off their ass to go protest some more. This is why the police here can't take a hard line in most cases, if you do, you come across as oppressive, and although the majority here would love that (me included) it just would not help this place at all.

Another point is, 90% of these protests come across peaceful, imagine how bad it would look if 4818 arrests were made for a majority peaceful protest.

With all due respect, I'd rather we focused on stopping drivers doing it since they actually kill people every day.

Many drivers break the law daily, the difference is their actions lead to serious consequences often.  Where as cyclists breaking the law have much less impact.  Every time I'm on my bike or in a car or in a bus, I see drivers going through red lights, speeding up to hit amber, stopping in advanced cycle points, speeding etc.

The reality of who's a danger on our roads and who runs red lights:

According a Freedom of Information (FoI) request made in 2008, in London, where cycle and 
pedestrian flows are high and signalled junctions ubiquitous: 

**No pedestrian was killed in collision with a cyclist going through a red light between 1998-2007** 
and cyclists were involved in only a small percentage of injuries to them. 

**Vehicles involved in pedestrian fatalities**

http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/sep/28/road-deaths-great-britain-data

&gt; 233 pedestrians died following collisions with single cars - more than were killed in incidents involving any other type of vehicle.

&gt; 65 pedestrians were killed in incidents involving two or more vehicles, while 61 died after a collision with an HGV or light goods vehicle (LGV). Two pedestrians died after collisions with cyclists - fewer than any other vehicle.

On the other hand, I can find deaths from motorists jumping red lights including the case where two [children died](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/9458112/Two-toddlers-in-pushchairs-die-after-car-jumps-red-light.html).

I've not got a problem with cyclists listening to music, it's the ones that have it turned up full blast and and hence completely oblivious to the noise of the traffic around them.  I'm feeling particularly cross about it at the moment thanks to a future Darwin award iPod wearing candidate who came within inches of being seriously dead under my front wheels this morning when blithely riding out onto a busy roundabout, cutting across three lanes of busy traffic and only missing going under my bumper thanks to me hearing all the horns blaring.  He had no fucking clue there was anything else on the road and didn't even twitch at the sound of all the horns.  

I've plenty of time for cyclists who obey the rules of the road, take the time to turn their lights on/or wear a high viz, look behind themselves and signal before changing lanes.  It's the dickheads who assume I can bring a 1500kg of car to a dead stop in 6 inches so they can get to work/college/graveyard on time that piss me right off.

Sorry, rant over.

&gt;One day we might have proper cycling facilities and this ""us vs them"" attitude will die off

My home town, Peterborough has an excellent cycle network.  Most of the major arteries into the city centre are paralleled by dedicated cycle routes that are separate from the road network as well as a scenic ['Green Wheel'](http://www.pect.org.uk/green-wheel/green-wheel-map) cycle route that takes in most of the nicer spots to visit in and out of the town.  Unfortunately that's just not possible in older towns where the existing road network is the only space available.

Yes there is. Your awareness of what is going on around you vastly drops.

&gt;Drivers can't hear anything and also listen to the radio.

They also have three mirrors used to see whats going on behind them. Not to mention they are much bigger and faster so are not going to get bullied out of the way.

&gt;They also act like they're the only ones on the road as proven by the number of speeding tickets given out each year, the hundreds of thousands of injuries and deaths they cause other road users and pedestrians and the hundreds of thousands of them that blow through red lights every single day.

Motorised Vehicles VASTLY outnumber bikes so I don't really see your point.

&gt;So maybe you should ""have more time"" for them and focus on the real menace of the road, poor drivers.

Not going to argue that there are some right plonkers on the road putting lives at risk.

&gt;One day we might have proper cycling facilities and this ""us vs them"" attitude will die off.

Wont happen, as a cyclist myself I'm shocked at the attitude to drivers, especially my FRIENDS. They have no understanding of what the road is and what its for. They just think they have the right to use it how they like because god damn, they pay road tax!

Road, or often referred to as PUBLIC highway gives everyone the right to use it providing you follow the pre-requisites set out to keep ALL users safe.

true,ParrotofDoom,english,Greater Manchester,"This post represents a serious problem that we, as a country, need to address.  Not specifically that cyclists need to ""respect the road"", but that some motorists feel its more important to highlight the selfish actions of a minority than it is to recognise that in the majority of collisions between a cyclist and a motorist, it is the latter who is to blame, and the former who will suffer serious injury or death while the motorist looks at a slightly dented body panel.

Your view isn't at all helpful and demonstrates several common misconceptions.  Cyclists already have to cope with the constant roar of wind in their ears so a bit of music, no matter what the volume, makes practically no difference to their ability to hear what's going on around them.  Furthermore, cyclists **have to weave around the road** because unlike cars, they cannot simply ride straight over the many potholes, grids, bits of dirt and puddles that they encounter daily on our decrepit roads.  That is why Highway Code Rule 163 gives clear guidance on how to overtake cyclists.  A minimum of six feet, in case you're wondering, is the gap you should leave.  And no cyclist I have ever encountered possesses the mindset that everyone else should ""get out of their way"".  Perhaps some selfish cyclists will buzz the odd pedestrian, but playing chicken with motorised traffic is one method of guaranteeing a day out with the undertaker.

If I were to reflect your argument back at you, how about all the motorists who break the speed limit, who drive with faulty lighting, who aren't insured, whose cars are not roadworthy (including a huge number of dangerous HGVs), who drive on pavements, who park on the corners of junctions, who park on white zigzag lines, who block yellow box junctions, who run red lights, who abuse ASLs... I could go on for a very long time.  What about the taxi driver recently fined Â£35 for driving 90 feet with a cyclist on his bonnet, a cyclist who died of his injuries?

I have been driving for over 20 years and am also a member of the Institute of Advanced Motorists.  I've been cycling for virtually all of my 40 years and I can say, hand on heart, that I have never, ever, struggled to drive safely around even the most inept cyclist.  To an observant, careful motorist, other road users are exactly that - road users.  Not obstacles, not a ""pain in the arse"" - ROAD USERS.

And by the way, it may help to point out that unlike motorists, who have no right to use the roads (they have an entitlement, granted by a licence that may be revoked at any time), cyclists, pedestrians and people riding horses have a common law right to use the roads, a right that supersedes all other claims to the public highways.",0,1358859151,null,0,false,0,c81f3mz,t3_171tlw,t1_c81f3mz,t1_c81ep5u,null,1431041571,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

true,mejogid,cnty-uk,London,"Calling out sexting is weird.  It's a personal, voluntarily act between people in relationships that uses the ability to communicate instantly over a distance to explore sexuality in a new way.  I don't see how people can find that threatening.  I mean, unsolicited penis pictures are obviously bad, but criticising sexting on that basis is like criticising sex on the basis of rape.

Likewise, sexual bullying isn't the problem - bullying is the problem.  There are a tonne of ways that kids bully each other, and they don't do it because they're over sexualised, they do it because kids can be vicious little shits.  Tackle the problem not the symptom.

I do think that kids shouldn't be exposed to the more sexual side of the internet (although by the time they're ~15 at the oldest you need to start accepting that they have natural urges that you can't healthily suppress).  That said, the way to deal with that is parenting - not by having some sort of dialogue on social censorship.

I do find it funny that it's always technology that is called out as the problem for kids and sexuality.  While at the same time, mass market advertising is overtly sexual, tween films (e.g. Twilight) are incredibly sex-centric, and culture as a whole is moving towards sex (50 shades of grey etc).

[This is an interesting counterpoint](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jan/18/end-of-courtship-us-catching-up) - that society has always been sexual and we shouldn't try to fight for an imagined tradition.",0,1358860288,null,0,1358861607,0,c81f9bw,t3_171t20,t1_c81f9bw,t3_171t20,null,1431041649,23,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,23

I'd rather forget about Ince and throw that transfer budget to Coutinho, really. I was never very excited about Ince anyway, and Blackpool are really trying their luck pricing him so high.

Oh, and we really need to sort out this full back problem we have. If Enrique is injured/off form, we're screwed. If GJ's injured/off form, we're even more screwed. Especially with Kelly only coming back two months later (I think?). Wisdom is good but he's youngish and inexperienced, and he's supposed to be a centre-back anyway. He also doesn't use the ball very well when he goes high up the pitch, his crosses aren't great, he can't shoot, and he can't take on defenders. He can kind of run up and down to receive and pass the ball but that's about it. He's starting to become really solid defensively though, so that's good.

And now that Henderson and Downing are picking it up, Shelvey and Suso seem to have lost favour and aren't playing as much now. Should we consider a loan move for either/both of them, maybe?

Bali has two very distinct tourist areas:

The very southern tip has a load of smart international hotels, catering to 'respectable' people with money.

Just north of this the international airport, and north of that is Kuta beach. Kuta is to Australians what Ibiza is to the UK, only the locals are a lot poorer. It's full of young people out to get drunk and have a party, and (mostly young) backpackers who are spending a few months travelling south east asia.

It's the sort of place where the cheaper hotel bathrooms have a hole in the concrete floor that doubles as a drain and toilet, and a concrete basin to store water because the mains water is unreliable. This isn't because it's a slum, it's just what most locals have in their house and the backpackers are used to it and the stag parties are too drunk to care.

In Kuta, the drug dealers and prostitutes are part of the attraction for the tourists, and no one is going to worry about this story.

Really, all that needs to change from your current posting system is to add a link:

&gt; [Sky Sports News](link) report that Philippe Coutinho, the 20 year old Brazilian wonder boy is [reported to be on the verge of joining LFC from Inter](gif)

If you can't do it straight away, cool - edit it in later. 

&gt; besides sometimes the rumors being speculated can change the day after or sometimes while Im making the post.

If the rumours change, then people can post updates in the comments - you don't have to edit it in if you don't want to, so I don't think that's a big deal either.

Personally I think it can work with both gifs &amp; sources without making too much of a change from how it is now - and certainly without taking away from the gifs that add the enjoyment and entertainment.

Cyclists already have to cope with the constant roar of wind in their ears so a bit of music, no matter what the volume, makes practically no difference to their ability to hear what's going on around them.

Sorry but I'm calling bullshit on that one.  There's a huge difference to your ability to process your surroundings between having 'open' ears and having music loud enough to hear over all the background noise.  And I say that as someone who's ridden cycles for 35 years and motorcycles for over 20 with both headphones in and out as well as being a car driver.  Being able to tell by ear that there is a vehicle behind or alongside you without having to take your eyes off the road in front is hugely important.  

&gt;Furthermore, cyclists have to weave around the road

What about the ones who aren't avoiding obstacles?  The ones who'll happily nip across the lane without looking when turning right or breeze straight through a pedestrian crossing on red?


&gt;And no cyclist I have ever encountered possesses the mindset that everyone else should ""get out of their way"". Perhaps some selfish cyclists will buzz the odd pedestrian, but playing chicken with motorised traffic is one method of guaranteeing a day out with the undertaker.

I'll [point you to my comment above](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/171tlw/a_determined_cyclist_who_set_up_a_petition_to/c81eurq).  I see this activity pretty much every day on the roads here.  Admittedly it's mostly teenagers, but there is a small minority of the Lycra and expensive-frames variety that take the same risks.  

If I'm sharing the road with someone I expect them to give me the same courtesy and awareness I give them.  

Like bad car drivers there are bad cyclists too.  I see good behaviour and I see bad behaviour from both sides, and like most things in life it's the bad that tends to be remembered.

I'm a little worried he'll be similar to Suso - technically extremely gifted, lovely control, vision, passing, but put him in against, say, Stoke, and he'll just get pushed off the ball all day long.

How will this impact Suso? I have to be honest, I know very little of Coutinho, apart from a couple of youtube videos, but will Suso be surplus to requirements if he does arrive?


And while I'm typing, Alonso - I can't see the reason to bring him back, apart from the obvious emotional ones, of course. We have Lucas and Gerrard as our 2 first choice holding midfielders - Lucas as the disruptor, and Gerrard to spray the passes. Which one of those pair would you drop to slot in Xabi? He's not going to come here to warm the bench, that's for sure.

Much as I love the guy (hell, who doesn't?) I can't see how he would fit in.

In terms of what transfers we need, I'd say we need more cover/competition for Enrique at LB, and a really good attacking midfielder - someone already developed - 25 - 27 years old, physically strong enough with skill, energy, strength and pace (I'm thinking a time machine to go back to pick up a 25 year old Gerrard would be ideal). 

Overall I'm happy with where we're going under Rodgers, Sturridge is a player we have needed since Torres left, I'm so happy to have him, and best of all his partnership with the ever brilliant Suarez is already at psychic levels after 3 weeks.

true,ParrotofDoom,english,Greater Manchester,"&gt; Sorry but I'm calling bullshit on that one. There's a huge difference to your ability to process your surroundings between having 'open' ears and having music loud enough to hear over all the background noise. And I say that as someone who's ridden cycles for 35 years and motorcycles for over 20 with both headphones in and out as well as being a car driver. Being able to tell by ear that there is a vehicle behind or alongside you without having to take your eyes off the road in front is hugely important.

The next time you go out cycling, have a listen to just how loud wind rush is.  Then put some headphones on and see how much quieter the music is.  You're talking nonsense - the wind is much, much louder than music.

&gt; What about the ones who aren't avoiding obstacles? The ones who'll happily nip across the lane without looking when turning right or breeze straight through a pedestrian crossing on red?

A tiny minority.  What about those motorists who, without signalling or offering the slightest indication of what they're doing, suddenly change lanes or turn off the road?

See?  It's bollocks to cite such examples.  Most people simply do not use the roads in this fashion, and to suggest that they do to support any argument that cyclists are their own worst enemy is fucking stupid.

&gt;  I see this activity pretty much every day on the roads here. Admittedly it's mostly teenagers, but there is a small minority of the Lycra and expensive-frames variety that take the same risks.

Small minority.  Motorists are involved in around 2,000 road deaths annually.  Does that mean every one of the 25-30 million or so drivers in this country are all murdering maniacs?  Of course it doesn't.

&gt; Like bad car drivers there are bad cyclists too. I see good behaviour and I see bad behaviour from both sides, and like most things in life it's the bad that tends to be remembered.

Really quick interjection.  Thatchers policies did really deep harm to large sections of the North, Labour did try to deal with that through generation and moving the civil service etc.., but those areas have taken a hit again as the cuts have bitten and the assumption that private business would come back and pick up the slack.  

On the economy more broadly, there have been systemic changes, but Labour certainly didn't divorce themselves from the economic policies of their predecessors as far as they probably should have to minimise the impact of economic shocks like the one we saw with the credit crunch.  They certainly deserve some of the blame for that, especially with regard to regulatory failures.  However, the current government seems to be conflating the issues and causes, which means that we will, yet again end up with solutions that don't deal with the issues (Oh and Labour does the same..).",0,1358864805,null,0,false,0,c81g23w,t3_171q8h,t1_c81g23w,t1_c81fpu1,null,1431042037,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I'm not disagreeing with that.  Unfortunately in discussions like these they usually devolve into 'All car drivers are psychopaths!'/'All cyclists are risk taking idiots!' with both sides pointing fingers and neither willing to accept that they can both be at fault at the same time.

As a car driver I do my best to take cyclists into account.

I'm not perfect by any means but it's not in *my* best interests to run one of them down, even if they are showing all the road sense of a stunned chicken.  

As  a cyclist I do my best to mitigate risks by riding with lights when it's dark and assuming that everyone else on the road is out to get me.  If I've got to cross lanes, or reposition on the road I make sure I know what's behind me, in front of me and to both sides before I do it.  And I assume that everyone else on the road wants to kill me.

true,mervis,num11,,"While I am a loyal Spurs fan I'll admit I am more so a Celtic fan (and season ticket holder) so having seen Hooper play around a hundred times, I feel I can shed some insight here.

Let me skip to the end first; I don't really recommend this signing. Hooper is not an upgrade on anything Spurs have. For the price Spurs will have to pay (8-10 mill), they will receive a striker who is at best, on level with Defoe. Hooper has scored only 1 or 2 goals (literally) for Celtic from outside the box, and most of his goals are from about 3 to 8 yards out. That being said Hooper is a natural goalscorer, and a great finisher with intelligent play. He's strong for his size, and he's still improving. 

Hooper was a Spurs youth, and is likely a Spurs fan, which may lend credence to this rumour. Additionally Hooper is looking for an England cap that is coming very slowly at Celtic. Obviously at Spurs this will come much faster, but I can't see him being any better than 3rd choice striker. Again, for 8-10 million, why not invest 5-6 more and get Leandro Damiao or Negredo or someone of that calibre? Hooper is great, but for what Spurs will use him for (and what he will be able to achieve) he's not worth his cost. If he's still at Celtic by the summer then he'll be available on the cheap, closer to 5 mill, and that'll represent a much better purchase.

EDIT: SkySports is now saying he rejected the contract extension. I doubt it's Celtic's final attempt, but if it genuinely represents his position then he'll probably be sold this window so we can get a quality replacement soon.",0,1358866274,null,0,1358876472,0,c81ge05,t3_171x9d,t1_c81ge05,t3_171x9d,null,1431042154,30,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,30

true,ParrotofDoom,english,Greater Manchester,"&gt; Cycling on the road should require a license. Though there definitely needs to be more cycle awareness in driving exams.

This is patent nonsense and in every jurisdiction across the world, wherever rules have been introduced that limit the ability of people to just get on a bicycle and ride, rates of cycling have fallen massively.

The good thing about cycling is that you can just buy a bike and go ride.  And if you do something wrong, the odds are that the only person who will be hurt will be yourself.  This is not the same for motorists, who, if they make a mistake, can easily severely injure or kill a number of other people.

&gt; I also believe bikes on the road should have brake lights and regulated head lights. Dick heads with flashing LEDs in pitch black conditions is something that needs to go.

Brake lights on bicycles are completely impractical and will never work.  As for headlights, the law already insists that cyclists have adequate lighting.  Flashing LED lights, well, have you ever cycled on a pitch black road and not been blinded by the headlights of oncoming cars, even when dipped?

Expanding upon this, taking into account the number of MDMA pills taken in the UK per month the risk of death seems incredibly low.: [In 2008 the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) estimated that between 2.5 and 5 million MDMA tablets were taken every month in the UK.](http://www.patient.co.uk/doctor/ecstasy)

The LD50 (level at which 50% of subjects would die) for caffeine is between 150-200mg/kg and for MDMA it's 100-300mg/kg (in rodents, no accurate data for humans). They both have similar dosages too: a cup of coffee has around 100mg caffeine, and MDMA dosages are usually 100-200mg. So to overdose, you need to have a coffee or hit of MDMA for every kg of your bodyweight (very, very roughly). 

But then there's the fact that caffeine is physically addictive while MDMA isn't, but MDMA causes neurotoxicity which caffeine doesn't, and a whole range of factors which make it difficult to determine which one is technically more dangerous.

From the petition:
&gt;Whilst the driving theory test has some optional cycling awareness questions, not everyone is tested with these

For your theory test, you don't just learn the answers to the questions you're tested on because you don't know what they are. You learn how to answer as many of the 1000+ possible questions as you can and from that are tested on the knowledge you gained from doing so. If the lack of a cyclist question in every test puts cyclists at risks then I dread to think of the effects of all those drivers who didn't have a question about level crossings, red lights or speed limits.

&gt;and the practical driving test does not have any particular focus on cyclists

The practical driving test doesn't have a particular focus on anything really, it's again a test on a random subset of what you've learnt prior. Most people should come across a cyclist in their time driving under instruction and on test there's always a chance of you bumping into one so you prepare for that. I also don't see how this could be specifically tested for - unless of course the test centres start hiring cyclists to ride in front of cars which I don't see happening any time soon.

There's also no mention of the hazard perception test, which actually does almost always include a section with a cyclist, whom if you don't give a click or two towards you won't get any points for.

As for the article, Jesus, where to start:
&gt;The other day it just hit me that perhaps people just need to be trained in how and when to overtake. They do it for horses!

Pardon? When it comes to overtaking horses there's exactly the same level of 'training' as with cyclists, a theory question that isn't always in the test and being taught how to pass them while learning.

&gt;Itâs more important than learning how to do a three-point turn as lives are at stake

The three-point turn A) Isn't called the three-point turn any more. B) Isn't always tested for - you do one of four maneuvers the tester chooses at random. C) Ensures you know how to control the clutch and are aware of your surroundings. If you can't do a turn in the road safely, the chances are you're doing something badly wrong and will end up hurting someone at some point, soon.

Liverpool fans have to stop ignoring the reality and cease being so defensive whenever another club is interested in our players.

Suarez just signed a new deal and is on decent wages, forming the core of an exciting new team. If he decides to give up and leave that is up to him. It is up to the club and the fans to keep him here - and we aren't helped in that by covering our ears to any transfer gossip.

A lot of people on this sub-reddit don't seem to realise how much the Police are held to account. Plenty of officers face disciplinary action for going about their duty unlawfully, and many cases are thrown out of court because the Police didn't do something right. We don't live in an Orwellian Police state like a lot seem to believe.

As I've said before, searches under Terrorism legislation require massive amounts of evidence to justify.

I'm not saying SWT are perfect, but by these anecdotal measures, they're certainly better than they used to be. Iâd imagine the comparison between pre and post privatisation is even more profound.

 They are, however, much more crowded now. And much more expensive. And it's this combination that really angers commuters and detracts from the overall improvements.

We keep the ball well, our passing has improved immensely over the course of the season, and when we do lose the ball, we fight to win it back asap.  Of course, we've made some mistakes, particularly at the beginning of the season.  Shelvey got a bit too enthusiastic about winning the ball back vs United and was given a red, and at the beginning of the season we saw on many occasions some of our players try booting it up the pitch again instead of playing it out the back.

I've seen huge improvements in our possession play and as the season progresses we just get better at retaining the ball.

You may delude yourselves you still live in a democracy with the rule of law, but objectively, from any outsider's viewpoint, you do not.

I'm going to watch that later when I've finished work. Until then I can't really comment on it. But it reeks of crackpot conspiracy theorist.

&gt; So tell me, how many police who've killed members of the public have been ""held to account"" and actually convicted? Can you name them? Nope, that's right, because THERE ARE NONE!

Right, this is the part where we're going to have to agree to disagree. I know it's hard for you to understand, but the reason Police Officers who've killed members of the public aren't convicted is because it's been held in a court of law that the killing wasn't unlawful. 

It's hard to explain without delving into individual cases where this has occurred over the years and examining them in detail. But one thing to bear in mind is that what you hear in the media (any media, on any side of the spectrum) is never the full story. The media love a story where a police officer has killed someone because they know it will rile everyone up. They don't care about the facts or the lead up to the death they just know they can get everyone arguing and talking about the event.

The Police aren't able to kill people willy nilly and get away with it, contrary to what you like to believe. 

&gt; But you can still kill people with impunity?!

No, no they can't. This literally never happens. People are killed by Police as either a last resort, or a horrible accident. Like I said it's hard for me to explain without going into every individual case but in the overwhelming majority of cases where police have killed someone, if you examine the events leading upto it and the circumstances of the event itself you'll excuse, or at least understand the officers actions.

&gt; but it's not a free country either

I'm curious, how would you describe a free country?

I'm gobsmacked you would say that.  That's really old shit, and broadly, uncontroversial stuff that happened and was observed, well reported, filmed etc.  Not only that, but given you accused me of being a liberal earlier, the irony is pretty much all of it is against Labour.  But it's interesting what you say, and it exposes the conservative mindset.

&gt;the reason Police Officers who've killed members of the public aren't convicted is because it's been held in a court of law that the killing wasn't unlawful. 

Suffice it to say, most never make it to a court of law, and those who do, even those who are obviously (to any non-British, non-monied, and therefore objective observer) guilty, don't get put away.  Are the police somehow miraculous?  Is it only everybody else who are sometimes guilty?  The police never are, right?  Or might it be bias that everyone else has a proportion convicted, but that the police never ever do (at all, ever, because they're pure and perfect...even when we have video and far more evidence than convicts your average Jo/e).

Yes it makes me angry, and sorry.  I'm not an angry person.

&gt;what you hear in the media (any media, on any side of the spectrum) is never the full story.

We're not going to agree here.  But I'd say the media, even the Guardian, generally paints a pro police picture.

&gt;The Police aren't able to kill people willy nilly and get away with it, contrary to what you like to believe. 

So, how do you explain the deaths and the lack of convictions?

&gt;This literally never happens.

On the contrary, it _always_ happens.

&gt;I'm curious, how would you describe a free country?

Well, I could do so in so many ways, but for fun: ~~Somewhere I can act in a socialist manner with as much freedom as I can act in a capitalist manner.~~  Edit: Since we were discussing policing rather than economics, I'm going to change that to ""Somewhere where the police are controlled from below rather than above""",0,1358873661,null,0,1359018701,0,c81inaq,t3_16w6j4,t1_c81inaq,t1_c81icab,null,1431043290,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

If you have two phones in your house, you can transfer an incoming call between them by hanging one up and then picking up the other. Useful if they phones are in different rooms.

This gives me an idea for a cool hack for intercepting someone else's outgoing phone calls.

You phone the victim up, and never hang up. Your end of the phone line is connected to a computer that can fake a dial done. When the victim tries to dial out, your computer detects the DTMF tones and replicates the call on a second line. The computer then relays the audio from one call to the other. The victim won't realise that you're also recording all their conversations.

If you give your computer a microphone and headphones, you could also program the computer to connect the victim to you directly when they ring particular numbers (e.g., their bank).

The victim may also become suspicious when they realise that they haven't received any calls for a while; or if they were notified out-of-band that their phone was always engaged by someone who tried to phone them. Regardless, I hope BT have measures in place to detect people abusing the system in this manner. I expect there is a maximum duration permitted for outgoing calls. Perhaps the exchange software listens for sounds that approximate dial tones, and flags them for investigation.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Not relatively better off. Basically you had your wages to live on and that was it. That was even the case other than a few quid child benefit in the 1980's. There was also no minimum wage. 

And when it comes to housing, OK you need a 5x income to afford a house but back then, mortgage interest rates in the 70's and through the 80's were 5 times what they are now. Add to that the fact income tax was both higher (around 40% in the late 60's dropping to 30% by the early 80's) the and with a lot lower tax free amount so as a percentage of net take home income, your mortgage actually cost you more per month.

[Here's an excellent article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/worklifeuk/cost-of-living-1971-today) that says in real terms, income has doubled between 1971 and 2011 and by any measure, people today are better off than a worker from 1971.

The reason people feel like they have less money now than then is because of the difference of what is seen as essential and what they spend their money on. Back in the 60's and early 70's, a house phone, television and car ownership were seen as a luxury not many had and they also bought cash, not putting stuff on credit. Nowadays almost every household seems to have at least one car, more than one mobile phone, landline, internet, Sky TV and thousands on credit cards. I know in our household alone, credit cards aside because we have no CC debts, those total over Â£800 a month, 1/3 of our income.


**tl;dr** We're better off than we have ever been but spend so much money on non-essential shit and repaying stuff we bought on credit that it doesn't feel like it.

2) Some of the PCs were rather unreliable. Several times we had crashes because they couldn't handle us tabbing out to set up our voip. And then prior to our game vs. Dench it took one of our players over 30 minutes to get into the game, a ritual that included him having to sit on a different bank of PCs to the rest of the team. They all seem to be pretty beefy machines, but some of them needed a defrag at the very least.
3) Online qualifier/seeding tournament would be good, if just to get more of an idea of what to expect from the teams we're going up against on a personal level - always fun to build strats to what you expect from certain teams and get the respect bans etc flowing.
4) Obviously any potential situation like the uWe tiebreaker needs to clarified before the tournament next time to avoid any frustration, but personally head to head record/GPM would be the way to decide such things assuming that there is isn't time for an actual tie-breaking game.
5) Pls hold in Mancland/Brum so we don't have to get up so early ;)

He has all the right attributes to be ""the best left-back at the club"" as Eddie Gray says, but he's always got a mistake that can cost the game in him. Peltier isn't a long-term solution there and neither is Drury, who has neither time, luck, nor Warnock on his side.

We are still crying out for a new centre-half, though: someone who can order our defence about on the pitch, take no prisoners *and* have enough pace to not get beaten by merely having the ball kicked past him. Unfortunately, those defenders are either in the Premiership or about to be. Tom Lees is getting very close to that level, in fairness, but I'm just not sure about Pearce. I mean, if they were going to be the partnership we need, surely they wouldn't still be conceding so many goals while playing together?

Right-back is the only position I'm truly happy with, to be honest. Byram is about as good as you'll get in this league: he's consistent and good enough to give the likes of Zaha a hard time. If we could get a better centre half or left-back, then we could even move Byram onto the wing and play Peltier at right-back.

Really?

When I was deliberately pushed into the other side of the road, the first words out of the taxi drivers mouth was ""HOW MUCH ROAD TAX DO YOU PAY?!"".

The attitude that motorists pay road tax for our roads and in turn anyone other than a motorist doesn't deserve to be on them is a very real danger.  This attitude isn't rare can be found on many articles about cycling.

&gt; How many cyclist injuries are actually caused by cyclists ignoring rules of the road?

Very rarely, except people going up the side of stationary lorry drivers.  Which is encouraged by those silly filter lanes leading to ASLs.  Lorries being the biggest killer of woman.

true,ajehals,eng-yorkshire,Sheffield,"&gt;I think it is vital to assign grades of importance to skills that most people would accept have higher or lower levels of necessity to exist in society.

It is, but most of those core skills ~~are~~ should be something kids are competent with by the time they enter secondary school (i.e. reading, writing, basic maths, scientific fundamentals and process).  In secondary school and at GCSE there is room for more, we've been choosing subjects pre-GCSE for a long time, so it would seem sensible to offer a variety of options even with the new baccalaureate and to keep at least one art element core.

That said my view is probably partly driven my concern that schools facing budget cuts will and do cut where they can, if we suddenly find schools not only de-prioritising art, but actively dropping it, we end up in a pretty piss poor situation.  After all, we do need and want well rounded individuals moving on from School, art like music and geography should be part of that.

* Don't listen to pill report and such, in general it's bullshit and people don't know what they're on about.

* Take it slow with a new batch or dealer, you can always redose

&gt;He also supported calls for ecstasy to be downgraded from the class-A status it shares with cocaine and heroin and said it would be ""disappointing"" if radical options on the law on cannabis were not looked at.

- the rules as to peak times were certain. Now they are not - a step backwards
- there were only 2 fares. Now there are many - a step backwards in terms of ease of decision making

No, but that's not the point I was making. There is no guarantee that you won't get sued/prosecuted either. I am not saying it is particularly likely, but I don't think a sound bite from Eric Pickles would help you much if it happened.

Evidence would not be a problem a lot of the time. If you spend 10 minutes or so clearing the pavement outside your own home, there is a reasonable chance that there will be witnesses who can identify you.

The trains themselves were a lot less comfortable generally. The older diesel trains used to have a very specific smell and you could smell it from carriages toward the front of the train (and further down when going through tunnels). The trains were (mostly) a bit slower. The stations would typically have a buffet bar type thing on smaller stations and a cafe on larger ones where you could buy fizzy drinks, a cup of tea or if you dared the dreaded British Rail sandwich (which was usually stale and horrible).

I don't remember whether you could buy alcohol on trains or if there was a shop (I was of school age at the time so didn't drink) but I do remember trolleys going up and down at one point on a trip to Cornwall from Manchester.

Since privatisation the only company that got things right was Virgin in my honest opinion. The trains are much nicer, the service is run fairly well (considering the capacity going north - south) and overall people are pretty helpful even when things do go wrong.

Southwest trains get second place for me, but are really struggling on lines into London because of capacity problems.

It's not an optimal situation because it gives women a lot of power to take advantage of, but you have to consider that until recently women had zero recourse from sexual assault and rape, and just had to deal with it. If you had the status or money you could practically go out and assault whichever woman you fancied as long as she wasn't of any status (and if you were a piece of shit, obviously), and would almost certainly get away with it. If anyone was punished and shamed it'd be her.

Our culture has (and still does, if we're honest) hold men in much higher regard and trust than women, and I can't begrudge them acquiring the tools to have the same rights and status that we enjoy, even if it means every once in a while these tools are taken advantage of. As upsetting as it is when it happens that's just kind of the price we pay for the human history of treating women as second class citizens and objects, I guess.

The argument for privatisation is that competition improves services at a faster rate; but to argue that this is the only way to improve services would be invalid.

In order to know if privatisation has made an improvement (which is the hypothesis) you need to test it against a control of a state based system. This control seems pretty hard to generate (using other countries isn't fair as there are other reasons why they could have better systems) so you'd probably use a regression model to see if the improvement brought after privatisation is statistically significant.

&gt; Even using your eyes you can compare the modern trains of today to the door-slammers of the past and see the improvement. That sort of thing might not be quantifiable in a metric, but then again, such blatantly obvious things shouldn't need to be catalogued.

The Act of Union created a new legal body in its own right called 'the United Kingdom'.  Every treaty this United Kingdom has signed since 1707 is still going to stand if Scotland declares independence from the United Kingdom.  That's why nobody is talking about the UK having to reapply to join the EU if Scotland votes Yes.  The United Kingdom's signature will still stand - the UK will still exist.   They're voting to leave it, not end it.

If the Scottish referendum actually broke up the legal body that is called the United Kingdom, and every international agreement and treaty it has signed in the last 300 years, everybody else would have to have a vote in it as well.  

It's as if an Umbrella Company were to part with a subsidiary, not as if two people were getting a divorce.  It's not just a union, don't get lost in the name.  England, Wales and Scotland coming together created something new and real of itself outside the component members.  It is that that continues to exist.  It's like Catalonia declaring independence and Spain discussing whether it has to change its name back to Aragon - which, admittedly, would be quite cool. 

If until and only up to the vote on independence (and not after), when discussing it if you wish to denote between the United Kingdom as it is now and those that will be left in the UK if Scotland chooses independence, it is perfectly politically acceptable to use the terms UK and rump-UK, or rUK.

Now if some do gooder decided to grant the same rights to contractors as to salaried employees the cash for contracting would drop to the same level as salaried employees. 

Also companies would figure that contractors aren't real employees and would still give them the minimum notice, whereas with salaried employees they tend to be very averse to doing that because they fear wrongful dismissal lawsuits.

If you're going to make it at home I definitely recommend the bucket (probably about Â£5-10 for a shit load in there) - also helps if you have space in the freezer for the bucket. You can basically pull chunks frozen from the bucket and then cook it direct from frozen with the above method. Lasts for as little or as long as you need!

Also, fyi you can microwave a pita bread to get it nice and soft in a few seconds too. As soon as it puffs up, remove, and the easiest way is to leave it for a couple of seconds and then slice a thin strip off the top and stuff the meat inside. Although you can slice it open in a slit if you like, it can be extremely hot to touch and it's easier to just chop a little bit off.

For the chilli sauce? You can buy this in bottles but most people have the ingredients at home already - or you can buy them super cheap! Basically Ketchup, dried chilli, and mint sauce. You can add lemon juice for extra tang, or water to de-thicken. It's fairly versatile for adding other stuff too.

Yogurt + mint sauce mixed for the white one. Chopping cucumber and other fresh salad small is also recommended (if you want to pretend you might be eating something remotely healthy).

Am I the only one that isn't crying crocodile tears about this?

All of nature is a struggle for existence. Existence for most species is _misery_. It's starvation, disease and the struggle to reproduce.

Our species can literally terraform the world to suit us. This is a good thing.

Yes, species are going extinct. It's regrettable, for sure, but it's a price worth paying for the expansion of the human race. 

You know what? In the struggle for existence, we _won_. If another species has to perish to make way for us - so be it. The only thing that can take us out now is _ourselves_ and we should celebrate that. 

I'd gladly save just a single starving child in Africa if it meant pressing the delete button on a species. We come _first_.

A polar bear would gladly eat me given half the chance. If it's a choice between them and us, let them perish forever.

I absolutely agree that we should spare judgement until all the facts come to light and that the media is generally irresponsible with this kind of news and exploits it. It is not my position at all that it is fair for the media to smear them.

They are able to though, because it definitely doesn't *look* good from what little we do know, which is:

They took photos of themselves with their junk hanging out standing next to an intoxicated and unconscious female laying on a bed. The sex very well may have been consensual, but it sure looks bad without more context and facts.

What's to say they wouldn't now. In fact the illegality of softer drugs probably puts people in more contact with harder drugs and gives them a path and method to purchase them. When you have things like weed and e illegal this causes people to be in contact with dealers who may also be able to supply harder drugs. 

When was the last time you were in a club and someone was walking around asking if you wanted to buy heroin. It never happens. However, I have been offered e loads of times, and chances are some of those dealers also know how to access heroin. If e was legal that access to hard drugs would probably be cut not increased.

Also e and heroin are both class A and carry the same penalties. If someone who takes e wanted to do heroin as well they would be, there is no legality issue stopping them, they are already doing something illegal.

Part of the governments insistence on illegality is that they have no solutions to the *real* issues that cause drug dependence, so it is easier to label people as drug addicts, criminalise them and have the public think they are doing something about drug abuse.

What is needed is some way of solving the complex societal problems of low education, aspiration, social and financial security that Britain's ""underclass"" (I hate that word) lack.

One of the issues brought up against the third home rule bill was the difference economically between the North and South with the South being more agricultural and the North having larger Industry, although nowhere near the same level of industry today what little industry we have would be massively important to consider when making this choice, which nation will have the best international links for raw materials and for export?

Political and Religious freedom? Although it is probably unlikely to happen is it possible that such things are encroached upon? If you aren't allowed to practice your faith that would be a serious point for some people.

Independent NI? If played correctly could work but would require a lot of effort, massive reform politically, more arable land use, low corporation tax, welfare reform and greater industry, stuff that should be worked on regardless of our place in the world.

A separate Union with Scotland although it probably won't be on the cards would also appeal to some voters for the cultural and historical aspects of such a relationship.

The CPS is supposed to operate on the basis that they believe there is a better than average probability that the defendant will be convicted based on the available evidence.  So, they must believe there is a compelling enough case to act.

Although there is likely no physical evidence, there could be elements of the witness statements will still provide a strong case.  For example, if several witnesses correctly describe a physical characteristic of Stuart Hall (e.g. he has a large birthmark on his right buttock) and it is considered difficult to explain how else they would know this without seeing him in an unclothed state, then it would lend credence to their claims that something was amiss.  This would be a pretty lucky break though for the police.  Witness corroboration (describing a very similar MO for each case of abuse) could also strengthen the case against him.

*(IANAL, but my father is a judge.)*

Edit: On a completely unrelated note, it's kinda weird how a lot of the (alleged) paedos and abusers identified in recent times seem to have similar kinds of personalities: Jimmy Saville, Jonathan King, Gary Glitter, Stuart Hall etc.  They're all a bit quirky and known for being slightly oddball or eccentric in their mannerisms.  I'm kinda disappointed about Stuart Hall though if this turns out to be true.  The other three were dicks, but I liked that guy.

true,ninereeds314,null,null,"Obviously based on the story. But even if those individual police couldn't have done differently, in a more general sense, my point still stands. If the law required the police escalate the situation until they needed to taser someone four times who already had a clear risk of heart attack, pressuring someone and making him more tense and anxious when they know that's the inevitable result rather than backing off and keeping the situation contained, the law is wrong.

Risk to others or himself? Obviously moving him was a huge risk. And obviously the situation was already mostly contained in his own flat. If he had a condition that wasn't self-inflicted - lets say he was having a massive epileptic fit - would you advocate tasering him four times as part of moving him against his will then? Sure, in his case the condition was self-inflicted, and it's hard to be sympathetic, but that doesn't change the situation at that time.

From your ""I'm not losing my job"", I assume you're in the police and therefore have a biassed viewpoint.

I have a biassed viewpoint myself, based on the police repeatedly raiding my in-their-80s grandparents based on malicious accusations, failing to check even the most basic facts (e.g. both my grandfathers name and, pedantically, his address were wrong on one warrant, not to mention the fact it was clearly impossible for him to commit the crime he was accused of), failing to follow procedure (e.g. refusing to show the warrant on both occasions, and shoving that and other paperwork, not even properly completed, through the letterbox the next day in one case) and then protecting the blatantly malicious ""informers"" rather than allow my grandparents any chance to defend themselves.

You see, despite your claims, one thing I know for a fact - from direct experience - is that the police collectively can and do protect each others arses, and the IPCC can and do actively take the polices side whenever there's no large-scale publicity, and that all this can and does occur in cases where the police have overreacted and failed to check their facts and now need to protect petty criminals and further harm their victims in order to protect themselves.

All any of us can go on is the information available to us, and you seem happy enough to accept the ""because they thought he was self-harming"". But the fact is that sometimes the police *are* in the wrong. They're not infallible higher beings any more than anyone else, but given their position of authority and power, they really should be held to a higher standard.

If you can't accept that, maybe you should look for a different job.

Perhaps you are American? I don't think there's the same amount of prestige connected with being a prosecutor in a high-profile case in the UK as it is in the States.

&gt; I'd be shocked it this is true but if you've got a source maybe I can learn something new today.

I'm a bit surprised you are shocked at this. Was it your impression that every police report automatically lead to a prosecution? For nearly all crimes that are reported (murder aside) the majority will never lead to a prosecution or conviction. 

As for rape statistics, of the paltry 46 of 100 rapes that are reported to the police, 9 are prosecuted, 5 end with felony conviction. American numbers, but I see no reason for the British situation being very different.

The Doctor, and Donna, doing Shakespeare, in London, and I could go see it for what remained of my frivolity budget. Saw it, loved it, waited outside after the show, but there were already too many people about, and I couldn't get close enough to ask for an autograph/picture. 

I realized the people who had been successful had been waiting there for hours, so that's what I did the next evening. Stood at the barrier they had set up from 6pm til 9, spent my time chatting with stage door guards, and making sure my camera would be of the proper exposure/shutter speed to get a good shot.

 Everyone started packing in and trying to force us to the sidelines, but those of us of the old guard banded together. One young girl of about 14 had been waiting since 2pm, and had been psyching herself up so intensely that by the time the cast emerged from the TARDIS-blue stage door she was in hysterics, poor thing.

Anyway, the whole cast was a dream, and the Doctor/Donna most of all. I was toward the end of the receiving line, and it must have taken about twenty minutes for them to reach me. They took a generous amount of time with everyone who asked for a photo or an autograph. One lady gave Ten a bag of baby clothes which he graciously accepted (apparently she follows him from event to event and gives him things O.o ) and another guy mentioned it was his birthday and GUESS WHO GOT A CHORUS OF HAPPY BIRTHDAY LED BY DAVID TENNANT AS HE TAKES ALL SORTS OF PICTURES WITH THE BIRTHDAY-KID'S CAMERA

Anyway, he got down to me, and all I wanted was a photo. He leaned in for the shot you see above. 
He rose to his full height and said ""That's a nice long arm.""
""Thanks!"" I replied a little too enthusiastically, and continued with the even more overenthusiastic comment of ""Your Hamlet was incandescent,"" which it was, you should check it out.

And the big hint that something isn't quite right is, of course, spending 6 hours on the toilet with your arse repeatedly exploding.

I'm not really a big fan of donner (or chicken donner) anyway - it's just convenient and relatively cheap compared with the chicken shish that I'd live on if it was cheaper. But it's a tad inconvenient spending 6 hours on a toilet, then an hour cleaning, so the lazier strategy is actually to cook for myself.

Everyone on the road should do their best effort to be aware of and be considerate to all other road users. To willingly cut off one sensory input with excessively loud music is insanity. 

&gt; This business about ""active"" and by implication passive glancing of driving is just such a weird argument.

Good drivers take ""active"" steps to be aware of the current situation.

You cannot rely on ""bad"" drivers doing these things, however anything that is basically ""in their face"" cannot be avoided.

true,binlargin,eng-lancashire,Lancashire,"That's not really how it works. Generally you'd buy crystal instead of powder which means low-level dickheads can't bash it with other random powders. Generally MDMA crystal is 50-80% pure and costs Â£25 to Â£45 per gram, this means you can dose based on a rough order of magnitude mg/kg ratio. For a 10 stone guy you're talking or 120mg pure or 150-250mg of crystal for a mind-blowing ride. If that doesn't work then you know you've got terrible stuff.

With shit pills people drop 1 not knowing how strong they are then drop another and another and so on filling their bodies with adulterants. This becomes the norm as pills are cheap and filled with everything but the real deal, and if you're used to taking 5-10 chalk pills a night and one day that 2000-5000mg of mystery shit turns out to be bad then you're fucked.

The main problem with crystal is you don't know whether it's MDMA or is some new research chemical, which is why you'd hope your dealer is smart, takes it himself, has the full range of regent testing solutions and only buys the good stuff.

If you're tech savvy enough to read Reddit daily you'd probably just buy it from the Silk Road and read the reviews to find the best dealer in your area, cut out all the gangster wannabees and get it directly from an importer/manufacturer.

Seriously kids, stop buying pills and get crystal at least once so you know what a good one is like. Stop getting ripped off with cheap pills and pumping your body full of shit.

Face it. Under British Rail we had more carriages, more routes, more regular trains, cheaper tickets, more staff (better paid most of them, too), fewer disruptions. And it cost the taxpayer a third of what it costs us now, and that's before you take into account the absurd ticket prices. The privatisation of this country's rail network is a consummate failure. And anyone who thinks otherwise is either one of those sad-act myopic free market ideologue bullshit merchants or just uninformed.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Our season has been nothing short of amazing if you think of all the crap that happened. 

Kelly/Borini/Lucas are injured for months before they even get to play with the team consistently. Gerrard, Allen, Downing and later Henderson and Sahin are all played out of position for months. We have Sterling who gets his first near full game in PL and suddenly he is the only creative outlet and our team does nothing but overburden him with the responsibility to do our creative work and he handles it very well. We are forced to bench both Enrique and Downing who were recognized seniors before this season, and we end up with Wisdom and Suso starting in their place, again it works without much hassle.

Sahin, Jonjo, Henderson, Downing and Joe cole in form keep us in EL. Enrique gets in form and gets us some assists and goals, Downing proves that he can be squad player and help the team (the width he provides is sometimes underestimated).

We get to january and suddenly we have Borini and Lucas back, the 3 players who were shown the door in the summer have become integral part of the squad, we have 3 strikers. Sterling is relegated to squad player, which is what a youth player in his first season should be.

Our season would have looked very much different if Enrique, Downing and Henderson failed to improve. If Sterling, Wisdom and Suso did not adapt so brilliantly to PL directly from playing youth competition. If Suarez scored at the rate of last season. If Gerrard didn't adapt to his deep-lying playmaker role as well. If Allen had not adapted so well to DM role, and it seems people underestimate how vital it was after lucas came back.

And this is without mentioning the great work jones did this season and last seasons end.

This squad looks vastly different from the squad that had Maxi, Bellamy, Kuyt, Carroll, C. Adam, Spearing and F. Aurelio.

Arsenal had vastly superior squad, Everton and Tottenham has more cohesive squad and yet Rodgers has managed to get this broken squad that was put together last minute.

When he mentioned how close we were to top 4 and even 2, he forgot himself a bit and who can blame him. But one proper look into our starting 11, the number of games they played together, the number of games they played in their new roles would tell you just how far from a championship team we were. Sterling, Suso, Downing and Joe cole aren't attack capable of supporting a title winning squad. Our midfield with only Jonjo starting in his true position were not going to challenge for title or even top 4.

Rodgers rotation and man management, depth provided by youth (they have 40+ starts if you only count the 3 newcomers) and luck put us in position where we are capable of signing 1-3 players and return of  2 others allows us to challenge for top 4. It's no longer bonus, but a real target.",0,1358906632,null,0,false,0,c81u9o1,t3_171uzd,t1_c81u9o1,t3_171uzd,null,1431048830,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"I know my opinion about Saha is far from popular here but if we did a similar deal as last season (not for Saha obviously, but for another extremely cheap option) it wouldn't be the end of the world. If you look at that signing within the context of its purpose, it was successful. 

I don't think we're in a position to spunk 20m on anything, so if we can get a patchwork deal just to have a body on the bench or pitch who isn't a fucking youth player I'd much prefer it.

I understand everyone wants us to buy exciting young players but that's not the only way to do things and it's rarely economically feasible for us. There are experienced and pragmatic  players that would cost us absolutely fuck all who could do a job for a game or two.

true,Mondoshawan,null,null,"&gt;  Drivers are passive lookers so they are better, cyclists have to ""actively glance"" which is a disadvantage, and now ""optical illusions"".

That bears no resemblance to what I said at all. If anything I'm saying drivers are *worse* because hazards need to be well presented to them in order for them to see them. Cyclists need to be *better* to compensate for their lack of mirrors. 

The only mention of ""optical illusions"" was to back this up with evidence. Otherwise it's all anecdotal. The fact that the eye is good at tracking peripheral movement is commonly accepted. You'd need to suffer from tunnel vision in order to miss a light in your rear view mirror. These mirrors are exceptionally useful because of this. The motorcycle video presents the opposite situation, where the lack of lateral movement endangers a physically ""slimmer"" road user. I felt this was useful because a) it enhanced the point of how the eye works and b) I thought you or any cyclist reading this might find it useful. 

I'm not writing a thesis here. In fact, I'm watching TV in a room while chatting with a flatmate and while having two different conversations over SMS with a friend. If my argument is disjointed then I apologise. 

&gt; &gt;   Car drivers do not use audio cues for anything except perhaps a flat tyre.

&gt; Are you forgetting the horn? This is what I mean, your arguments are either bad or badly constructed

Hang on a moment, in the very next sentence you say that deaf people are at no disadvantage, thus negating your horn comment. The horn has no analogy for a deaf person, there are zero visual queues. Both of your statements cannot be true. Besides, the horn is very very rarely used and when it is it's usually more of an after-the-fact reprimand against some perceived slight as opposed to it's highway-code intention of being a warning of impending danger. 

Note I'm not saying that deaf people are ""worse"" at anything, they naturally compensate by using their other senses in everything they do. A hearing person with loud music on doesn't automatically turn on ""deaf mode"" where they gain these years of experience in being aware of their surroundings only through vision.

If not for him being a gigantic piece of shit who should never wear our shirt again, Darren Bent is the type of player I'm talking about. Could easily get someone like that on a short loan and they'd cost us basically nothing. 

It's difficult. I can't really rattle off a bunch of mediocre strikers but I wouldn't be surprised to see something completely out of the box like Kenwyne Jones. I know a lot of people will groan at my viewpoint here but if there's nothing big on there's nothing big on. Gary Hooper has also been talked about and AVB was at Celtic park to watch someone today. 

I admire the optimism of people who still go on about Llorente and Damiao but something like that isn't going to happen.

In an almost perfect but still realistic world I still think Alvaro Negredo would be an incredible fucking buy for us this window. He isn't like a Saha signing or anything, but he would be a massive improvement on our strikers IMO. 

If we want to take a step forward it needs to be someone like that, but as I said if that's not in the cards financially there's no point in bitching about it if we make another bargain deal. I pray in summer we finally make a big striker signing.

Had the ref not cocked up it was 100% that Liverpool would have two more points.

In that case the game would have been completely different and there is no way of saying that a goal wouldn't have lead to the opponents rallying and perhaps scoring two and winning.

That's why the Everton one stung so bad; we were just robbed of a guarenteed two points at the death which is actually pretty rare.

Deaths per year = 187 (I'm assuming this is just in the UK).

Lifetime probability of dying from MenB = 1 in 3,937 (the mortality rate of measles is [1 in 5,000](http://www.ovg.ox.ac.uk/measles)).

Meningitis B mainly affects the young, so let's assume around 70 years are lost for each death, giving a value of Â£2,100,000 per life, which seems quite low.

- I also watched today's game, and Benteke was far from anonymous...He had the brilliant goal off a volley (I know that was mentioned), he won a ridiculous amount of aerial duels, and he would have had two assists if the rest of his team wasn't shit.

- 20 games may not be long enough to gauge how good someone is, but you can gauge talent, potential, and strengths...Benteke is damn strong, can lead a line, and is great in the air...three things that we desperately need.

- Gary Hooper is essentially Jermain Defoe lite...he's a poacher...If all three of our strikers were healthy and in form, the order would be Ade/Defoe/Hooper. Spending 10 million on someone that would be a third choice striker is not something Levy tends to do.

- ""he looks impressive in patches but we need someone who is a proven goal scorer."" Not sure why this is true. Plenty of people here want Damiao (not me), and he's far from proven in any sense of the word. Also, as far as Benteke specifically, Levy loves to buy young talent that could have a big sell on, and Benteke fits that perfectly.

- I don't see why another half a season would prove anything if Wilk is saying the first half didn't prove anything. He also doesn't need to keep them up with his goals to prove anything, because his team is shit.

However there's a number of reasons the riots in London elicited such a response, one of which is that disorder has not been seen in England on such a scale for over 30 years, given the spread possibly not since the 1920s/30s and the general strikes and Mosley.

It put the wind up the establishment in a massive way and you can see it plainly in the reaction: a deliberate massive intelligence operation using all the powers of the modern state to track people through CCTV, facebook etc.  Lower courts and magistrates refusing jurisdiction for very minor crimes and imposing disproportionately severe sentencing in order to ''set an example'' or deliberately refusing to deal with a case on the basis of the facts.  

I firmly believe that they have created a huge social problem through that response and ruined many ordinary peoples lives for very minor and in some cases virtual transgressions. 

Northern Ireland is far from the centre of power and as a result disorder is not seen to matter as much, hence the IRA bombings on the mainland and Canary Wharf which was a tactical stroke to demonstrate the capacity to strike at a distance, but I digress.

The riots in Belfast [from my point of view - I live in Galway] seem to be focussed around the same areas and interface points, and to consist of attacks against property, cars burnt out, attacks against police landrovers, and stone-throwing between gangs of yoofs from both areas.    There seems to be a low-level of menace and inconvenience rather than serious violence, murder, or what really gets up some people's noses looting. 

As well as that you have to ask what arrests and custodial sentences will do for this kind of offence?  Is it in many cases economically  worthwhile to arrest, try and send to prison someone for throwing a brick at landrover?  

Whatever your opinion its a worthwhile question to ask.  I think we all know that directed social programmes will have a far better and more permanent bearing on the situation.

Now the black market that did exist has to compete with legally available drugs at 1/100th their previous price but for the same risks. Most of them leave the industry, those that don't have to find buyers who are unwilling to pay the new massively slashed prices. Its basic economics, alcohol and tobacco have been legal for ever so the taxes are seen as making the prices, high illegal drugs however are massively inflated in price so the taxes would not seem so bad.

The public only get to vote yes or no, they don't get to choose the timing, or the framing of the question, or the way in which it will subsequently be interpreted. The judgement will also depend hugely on the circumstances in the weeks or even days leading up to the polls, on extraordinarily shallow rhetoric from the tabloids, the editorial lines of press barons, and the fleeting popularity of supporters and opponents. It's no exaggeration to say that the future course of the nation could well be decided on the basis of exactly how much people hate Nick Clegg.

Look at the history. It wasn't an exercise in democracy when Sarkozy offered a series of referendums (on illegal immigration and forcing the unemployed to take any work offered), a couple of weeks before the French election, in a desperate bid to head off the Front National. It wasn't when California voted to put in 'three strikes' laws which sentenced tens of thousands of petty thieves to life in prison. Or when [a billionaire ran a referendum campaign in Michigan to prevent public infrastructure investment which will break his lucrative monopoly](http://blogs.windsorstar.com/2012/09/10/blanchard-moroun-referendum-a-huge-waste-of-money/).

Scotland would be able to determine its EU membership independently of England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, which is a relief to me. Plus, the Scottish Parliament would be able to legislate in a huge number of important areas upon independence, making the ""swapping London for Brussels"" argument look all the more idiotic. If you think independence makes no difference without leaving the EU - which so many ""Better Together"" campaigners have said to me and apparently believed - you're arguing that the Scottish Parliament and the UK Parliament already have the same amount of power, which is obviously far from true.

He's a pretty solid player, no doubt. Should he be starting every game as he currently is? Probably not. I think he'd be very useful as a second half sub for Sterling because the two have very different play styles and it would completely change the mindset of the defenders.

My main problem with him is that you never really know what sort of game you'll get out of him. He could play lights out and show glimpses of another level, or he could play like he'd rather be at home watching on the tele.

Still, the question is whether or not he should be on the team or not. I think it's a tough question. For one, I'm not really sure what he earns.

true,ikrau,lfc55,,"I couldn't agree more. All this talk of bringing in new players has really kinda bummed me out. I agree, we needed a goalscorer. We got one, at first (I'll admit) I wasn't too keen on bringing in Sturridge but now that he's shown up and has gotten some goals. I'm happy to say he's in the squad. 

But getting back to my original point, the talk of bringing in Coutinho and Ince is just kinda throwing me off. I think Henderson has really just started showing his worth and playing like a player we need him to be. Having him play next to Coutinho in the future would be nice, but lets be honest, no one is gonna be happy if Stevie G gets benched for the 22 year old Henderson. Now don't get me wrong, I think Henderson is now turning into a future replacement for our skipper, but I'm afraid with the prospect of Coutinho coming in he will be resorted to be only on the bench. 

Now, addressing your Downing topic. I think Downing is starting to show his worth as well. Granted he is on the older side of things in the squad but he is technically in his prime and I think that with the addition of Sterling and Borini coming back from injury has really sparked some life into his career. He knows that he has pressure on him and that if he doesn't step up he's gone. I don't want Ince to come in (this season at least) and these are my reasons why. 
1. Downing, Borini, and Sterling are all playing outside on the wings. We don't need another winger. 
2. If we get another winger Downing is the one who is gonna be dropped from that position and everyone knows he CAN play full-back, but I would never take him over GlenJo or Enrique or Wisdom. So he'd just be shit outta luck for squad options. 

All in all, I'm happy with the squad we have. Maybe the current starting XI isn't exactly a title winning eleven, but it definitely has room for future growth...maybe that's what's best. But my main concern is, putting players who have been playing well of late, out on their ass isn't fair in order to make room for players who haven't proven themselves in the premier league.

Spurs are tied 1-1 with Arsenal at The Emirates. Gareth Bale scores the winning goal with 5 seconds left in the match and the team is freaking out. Benny is just clapping a little bit. Everyone looks over and is like, ""Benny, what are you doing?! We just beat Arsenal at the Emirates!"" Then Benny is like, ""Arsenal? I thought we were playing QPR?"" Then everyone is like, ""Benny, QPR's kits aren't red!"" Then Benny squints his eyes and is like, ""Oh man, those shirts are red! LOL""

---

On a serious note, this is why I love BAE. I'm all about honesty. I'm not retarded like some fans, I know that most players go to teams for the money. I say ""go to teams"" because I think saying that they ""play for the money"" is wrong, because a lot of people really do play for the silverware. Anyway, that's what makes it really special when you get a guy like VdV that clearly fucking loves the club. That's why we all still love him even though he's moved on. If every player was like that, it wouldn't be special. 

That's the same reason we're all Spurs fans. If we made the Champions League every season, would 2010 have been special? My favorite part of being a fan is having hope that your team can surprise you and do something amazing. If your team always does amazing things, it really takes the value out of it. Think about how much it normally sucks to be a Bradford City fan. They're mid-table in League 2, but for the next two weeks, they're on top of the fucking world.

I think it you look at the goals, there was some controversy around the free kick given for a minimal contact foul on Sterling that lead to 2-0. I honestly expected Sterling to get a yellow for diving. There was similar controversy around Everton's 2-2 goal where the throw just prior definitely should have been given to LFC. 

Suarez had a couple of nasty tackles, especially the one on Distin could have earned him a red card and as such Everton fans might argue that he should not have been on the pitch to put in that injury time goal. 

So I think it's a bit biased to just look at the disallowed goal, and not look at the refs fuckups from the rest of the game.

Only with 10 have they portrayed regeneration(Whether it be with The Doctor or another Time Lord)as having one person die, and another person takes over with their memories. It doesn't even make sense within Tennant's run, in my opinion, since so much of his grief is focused around the Time War. Which, logically speaking, if you're just a person with someone else's memories, then there's no reason to feel such regret over what 'you' did, if you didn't actually do it.

And, like I said, this is the only time it's portrayed like this. In fact, I just finished watching Spearhead From Space the other day(Pertwee's first episode), and he reacts as though he's exactly the same person. Because that's more of how it's always been portrayed. He's the same person with a different face. He even asks for a mirror and says something along the lines of 'Well that's no good, what have they done to me? That's not my face at all!' And even portrays a little bit of that Troughton personality to convey that he's still the same person, just adjusting to a new face/body.

For all intents and purposes, The End of Time was just trying to play on people's heartstrings, and ignored everything that has ever been portrayed about regeneration simply because they knew fans of Tennant would eat it up.

As has been said, he tracks back, but he also provides width. We can't play the way we do if the fullbacks come inside to help defend against the strikers/midfield.

On his mentality and leadership and lack of team-spirit for lack of better word:

I think we have ruined bunch of players last season. When a player moves to a team that expects to win and wins every match, they get a mentality that players who draw or lose majority of their matches don't. Secondly, he isn't a leader, he doesn't yell at people for failing to defend even though he defends. He doesn't yell at strikers for failing to meet his cross, he is quiet and so you will only get as good game as he wants to put up. He doesn't change in the middle of the game for better, last year we had Bellamy and Kuyt (albeit not often), both excellent at leading their team in work rate and shouting if needed. I don't know why he doesn't want to take initiative, why he only minds his own business as if the score or the points don't count towards him. Seniors are supposed to hound the younger ones into working harder etc. but his experience is useless if he only works on himself. Mid-game you see defenders chatting about their game, last week Sturridge was chatting with Gerrard, how many times have you seen Downing chat with Suarez or gerrard or Glenn johnson? 

I don't think he feels like he belongs, that he has right to tell people to do this or that. Even when he performs well, he is always doing his and expecting others to do theirs. No telling them to pass earlier or later or make runs. This would be good if he has excellent chemistry and it wasn't required, but he doesn't have that, the team is in transition and it needs to coordinate on the pitch. Which is what you see all the chattering between players at half time and even Carroll used to get Skrtel infront of him at corners. Henderson was burdened by this, he was also passenger, hired to do his job, but lately you see him thinking he is part of the team. After he scored he his his chest, after downing scored he silenced his critics.

It is extremely likely that he or anyone else would have died if not for the Police's involvement. Now I understand that they didn't choose to be involved but violence is never an appropriate response to a man in the state he was. 

There was no evidence in the article to suggest he was a danger to himself. for a time he was to other people if he was throwing stuff out of the window but that soon stopped. He was coherant enough to explain what he had taken and when to the police and I can only assume that things started to go wrong when the police decided to arrest him. I'm not sure what grounds they had for arrest but criminal damage doesn't seem right if he is the tenant. Of course I don't know the full details but hey. 

You're choice of language suggested a willingness, almost a desire and eagerness to punish people with violence if they threatened you or officers. That is not your job, your job is to control the situation and minimise harm to eveyone involved, not gleefully pull out your tazer as you decided that they had merited ""to ride the lightning"". tazers are torture compliance weapons used by lazy / badly trained police who cannot find a better way to deal with the situation. 

You casually talk about riding the lightning as if these things didn't kill people. They do, the UN describes them as a weapon of torture that kills. Normal police officers shouldn't even have them, clearly this case and others from the UK demonstrates that you do not have sufficient training to use them appropriately - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taser_safety_issues

This isn't really that type of situation because it isn't about gender roles it's about personal preference. Doctor Who has so many amazing and badass characters to choose from it isn't really surprising a guy would be more likely to choose an adventurer, Doctor, or alien of some kind. I've never seen it as a gender roles thing so much as the fact that there are so many other things to choose from besides the Tardis that are just as fun to portray. I think it's just a bit presumptuous on your part to say people ""give so many fucks"" I don't really think that's the reason.

Like there's a reason if it's the same thing over and over without radical change. 

Out of universe, we all know people dont like to risk iconic franchises with radical change and people generally react bad to radical changes with iconic characters(see: ultimate spider-man) so that's why it hasn't happened. However. Doctor Who -is- about change so there is no reason for it ***not*** to happen. What's most important is a good actor and the beauty is it could be anyone. 

I'm not saying it can't happen, just saying I would feel a little ripped off without a satisfactory explanation. Don't tell me it's random when it only happens near or past the end of his natural lifespan. If they get that part down, I'm up for it.
