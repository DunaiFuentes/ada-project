No need. I know all about it, you're talking about the PAC's.

&gt; SARAH PALIN (perhaps one of the most right winged politicians to ever grace the currently most right winged country in the world)

Right. She is the most right-wing person on earth, yet her views are moderate when compared to BNP, Mosley and let alone the EDL.

Sarah Palin is a political opportunist. I doubt she really believes much. Her entire career as a self-serving politician is an example of this. She hitched herself to the tea party movement because it was popular, she wasn't a founder of the tea party movement. I bet she doesn't even know what the hell most of the tea party positions are

&gt; Europeans are much much quicker to label anything fascist

Coming from the guy who just labelled the *tea party* as fascist

&gt; I can assure you now that most political systems we have in place are technically 'fascist' 

well, you are going to have to. just saying ""the tea party is right wing"" doesn't count.

you are also ignoring the *very name* of the tea party. there was a direct contradiction there with the definition of fascism.",0,1377139455,null,0,1377139784,0,cbsqwxp,t3_1ku48g,t1_cbsqwxp,t1_cbsqs7l,null,1429744241,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

This can only be done by creating goods that people want to buy - Agriculture, resource extraction, manufacturing and advertising.

If we mandated a higher minimum wage, you'd find one of (or a mixture of) a few things happening:

1. The jobs market would shrink due to decreased demand for labour. People won't take on employees that they are unable to afford. This would create a vast divide between those lucky enough to work and therefore receive a better salary, and those who cannot find work and therefore are forced to live off benefits. Furthermore, as the demand for jobs outstrips the demand for labour, companies will be able to cut back on employee benefits such as pensions and working conditions.

2. Labour will continue to move East. Why manufacture basic goods in the UK when they can be done so elsewhere and then imported? We're just about keeping our heads above water at the moment with international competitiveness and this would be dunking us under. Companies aren't charities: they will continue to try to make as much profit as possible. If the profit premium from 'made in the UK' is less than the added cost of wages then they will find somewhere cheaper.

3. Inflation. Give everyone a pound for doing the same job and producing the same amount and they will all be earning roughly the same as they were before. If bread production costs £1/hour/(production volume) extra to produce, then the company will recoup the added costs by selling the bread at higher costs. Another worker goes with his extra £1/hour and tries to buy bread, only to find that the increased costs have completely mitigated his pay increase. For those on the bread-line this will make no difference, except for pensioners who will see the value of their savings diminish.

Why should we allow the incompetents in Government continue to meddle in the market? They don't know what they're doing, and anything they do do just makes things worse!

Money, value, capital etc. are like fitness and strength. The only way you can legitimately get it is to increase the amount you do or the efficiency of what you already do. Printing money and giving it to people hurts savers and helps debtors, but doesn't actually help the economy. You can't force business to go against its own interests: it either dies or finds ways around.

One solution is to allow employees to take stock in their companies. When the Government suggested this the Unions got pissy because it would mean they'd be superfluous.

The show really stays fresh because with each new doctor comes new filming techniques, to put it short, the current doctor who series is a very nicely shot show.

If the B.N.P. got as popular as the T.P., I can guarantee that a Conservative politicians would have used that.  But there is literally no political gain to be had because the B.N.P. are so heavily frowned upon.

And yes, the Tea Party is fascist.  Fascism is the merging of corporation and state, which Obama seems to be doing a pretty fine job on.  the Tea Party is more right ring than the Conservatives, who are conventionally seen as more right wing than democrats.  When your health sector and prison sector is privatised, I think you can pretty safely say that, yes, it is fascism. 

'Europeans are much much quicker to label anything fascist-Coming from the guy who just labelled the tea party as fascist.'- Yeah, that's literally what I just said.  My point is proven in that I, like many Europeans, do consider the Tea Party fascist.  You don't.  So maybe you have a skewed view on what is correctly labelled left and right wing, so your government can get away doing shit things by just labeling any other way of life as 'liberal'.

And come on man, as if name means anything.  The terms democrat and republican literally mean the exact same thing.

I think both the U.S. and U.K. are seriously manipulated by their governments.  Unfortunately, you guys get the worse of it as you are the big powerhouse of the two, so you they ensure U.S. citizens are fully under their grasp.

Two things and I'll rest my case.

1) We aren't lacking in chance creation. With Aspas, Sturridge, and Cou we move the ball seamlessly. Gerrard to distribute. Suarez back on the pitch in a few weeks. Do we NEED a top signing to give us more potency? No. Do we need more top quality depth? Yes. And that takes time and money. Both are lacking at this point. We'll get Papa and Will and probably close up shop.

2) We aren't expected to be a top four side, but we will try. We're going to play attractive football and try to better last years finish. The more I realize that Spurs are about a window ahead of us with AVB implementing his will as quickly as he has (with Levy's help), we're going to catch up. 

We're clearly going to play our hearts out, and we're going to try to play consistently good.

Don't fool yourself - these 'top sides' still have new managers and players to settle in. Continuity has its perks.

If we get over 80 million, Levy has done an amazing job. If we get over 80 million and Coentrao, Levy is a hero. If we (like one article reported) get 92 million plus Coentrao, there should be a statue of Levy outside the new stadium. When a player is this overvalued, it is always better to sell. As people on this sub realize, this money can be used to bring in more players (Capoue, Soldado, Paulinho [who was overvalued after the confederations cup], Chadli [whom I believe was a bit undervalued], Willian, and Lamela) to make the team stronger than it was when we had Bale. Further, this money can be used to build our new stadium. Statistics show that upgrades to stadiums are sure-fire revenue boosters. More people come to really nice stadiums, even when the teams aren't amazing (look at Sunderland's finances after building the Stadium of Light). Getting this new stadium built will guarantee an elevated revenue stream that will in time eclipse the amount of money being discussed for Bale.

The journalist clearly doesn't like socialism but he also clearly states he likes Scotland and the Scottish people.

&gt;Don’t misunderstand; the Scots were delightful hosts. The country is as beautiful as advertised, but...

You see after the ""but"" he describes all the things about socialism he dislikes. 

Please carry on debating why socialist policies are good for Scotland but don't start off with an obvious misrepresentation of the journalist as some sort of nationalistic hate monger.

Also aren't they going to help market us and raise our profile outside of England (where let's be honest, they're more popular than us... a few freindlies vs them in the USA, Asia, South America,and Africa/the Middle East can only be good for us long term)

Also let's be honest. No one else would pay 100m + for Bale.What if in a year or two he wanted to leave and end up at Manu or g-d forbid Chelsea?

Now Stoke are a fairly aerial team and even against them we only managed 5, to Crouch's 10. So we're weak as hell at this and Benteke is a lot more mobile than Crouch so there's a big problem. I think the likelihood of seeing Skrtel make a return is very high, I don't really know if it will be at the expense of Agger or we put out 3 central-defenders.

* LFC 11/12 season transfers:   £57.5M
* LFC 10/11 season transfers:   £85.8M

Total over last 4 seasons of  £227.2M spent on player transfer fees, net spend of  £81.4M

* Spurs 13/14 season transfers (to date):   £60.6M
* Spurs 12/13 season transfers:   £64.5M
* Spurs 11/12 season transfers:   £8.3M
* Spurs 10/11 season transfers:   £22.9M

Total over last 4 seasons of  £156.3M spent on player transfer fees, net spend of  £32.8M.  

If you include Willian/Lamela at let's say £30M each then they've spent ~£216.3M over the last four seasons and say they then sell Bale for £80M, with a net spend of ~£12.8M.

So, to recap, LFC spent £227M, net spend of £81M.  Spurs spent £216M over the same time frame, net spend of £13M.  How are we not in that bracket?  We've spent more than them over the last 4 seasons and our net spend is much higher than theirs thanks to the support of FSG.  

It's not that we're not in the same bracket as Spurs and it's not spending money that's the issue, it's the quality the money was spent on was simply not there.  

EDIT:  Semi-related trivia question just for kicks.  From the 4 seasons above, we've only made £1M+ (fees paid vs. what we sold for) on three players that have left (all others have been losses or less than £1M made, more than a dozen people in this category).  Guesses who they are?

Now Johnson and Enrique are great but even they aren't going to be able to match Agbonlahor for pace.

Then there's Delph, he's hard to dis-possess and has already notched up an average of 4.5 successful dribbles. Having an extra man at the back will really cut down on his options and make it easier to contain him. Particularly if Enrique is pushed forward.

Skrtel is decent in the air, and strong on tackles, so he can really be useful against Benteke.

Key bits describing that process:

&gt;Every Evertonian can have their say and help to shape the new crest design. There are various ways to get involved:

&gt;    Online - Every fan can complete a questionnaire on evertonfc.com to provide their feedback on how they want the new crest to look and the importance of the individual elements from previous crests. There will also be an option for fans to upload their own designs, sketches or make further comments. More information on this will be available on evertonfc.com in the coming days.

&gt;    Focus groups - A series of focus groups will be set up with representative supporter groups such as Supporters’ Clubs, Shareholders, the Fans’ Forum, the new Junior Fans’ Forum, the Everton Heritage Society and the Everton Former Players’ Foundation.

&gt;Gaining as much feedback as possible from Evertonians is top of the agenda until mid-September and the next phase is to begin designing the new crest.

&gt;Independent of the Club, Kenyon Fraser will collate all the suggestions, ideas and feedback from supporters. They will review, interpret and then create design options for the fanbase to vote on.

&gt;They will then hand over to you again to make the final decision. The newly designed crests will be presented alongside a detailed explanation of how each one has been developed.

&gt;Every supporter with a registered customer number, based on ticket purchasing or membership - an estimated 300,000 fans - will be asked to select their favourite design at evertonfc.com.

&gt;The results of the vote will be revealed on Thursday 3 October and the new Club crest, shaped and chosen by Evertonians, will appear on all media, buildings, merchandise and, of course, the famous Royal Blue jersey for the 2014/15 season. 


I'm quite surprised by the timeline, though. Final day of consultation is September 15, selection starts September 23rd.

But somehow stories that feature a super controlling, really creepy pedophile, who apparently gets off by being emotionally manipulative (almost to the point of abusive) to a girl who is literally a fraction of his age become bestsellers. 

The female lead has no redeeming qualities at all- she's happy to be completely controlled by him, and when he randomly decides to break up with her, she reacts by going catatonic and then passive-aggressively tries to kill herself to get his attention. 

And of course they decide to risk her life by getting her pregnant with a monster that literally tries to eat it's way out of her uterus. If that isn't enough, the idiot friend becomes an even bigger idiot- and also a pedophile- by falling in love with the cannibalistic infant monster. 

All of that is made worse by writing that seems to be done by a slightly stupid teenager.

&gt;During his trip to Berlin, Miranda visited Laura Poitras, the US film-maker who has been working with Greenwald and the Guardian. The Guardian paid for Miranda's flights. Miranda is not a Guardian employee but often assists Greenwald in his work.   

So to say ""now it transpires"" and and use the extremely loaded term ""far from being an innocent"" is purely to try and paint the objection to his detention as being based on a totally false premise that they can dismiss. One that only works if you've not bothered to read any other sources.
 
As for the lawyer issue I take it that they are referring to how he refused the lawyer they offered because... shockingly... he didn't trust them? The people who didn't allow him a pen to note down the questions asked, didn't provide the translator they promised? 

But let look at what happened with the lawyer shall we?

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/20/david-miranda-reason-detention-lawyers

&gt;Once the Guardian became aware of his detention, multiple efforts were made to make contact with our client, the letter says. Bindman's lawyer, Gavin Kendall, went to Heathrow in person ""as he was given no telephone access to our client"".

&gt;He arrived at Heathrow just before 3.30pm and when he made contact with the police the only explanation given was that he was being detained under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000.

&gt;""At 4.05pm, Mr Kendall was finally granted access to our client, just one hour before the nine-hour statutory maximum detention power expired.""

Miranda asked wanted his own lawyer, as would any one who had two brain cells in their head, that lawyer wasn't given telephone access to his client and was kept waiting after he arrived before being allowed to speak to this client. Funny how the mail missed that part out. 

Or these parts

&gt;They refused to confirm what our client had been asked before his representative arrived, nor would they provide him with a record of what was discussed. Our client asked for a pen to write down the questions and this too had been refused,"" the letter reveals. Miranda who is Brazilian was ""not provided with an interpreter

Or how he was [told he was going to jail if he didn't give up his e-mail and social media passowrds](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23776243).

Or how about how [97.2% of people stopped are realised in under an hour](https://twitter.com/AdamWagner1/status/369527411567628288/photo/1) and trying to pin how his detention happened to take the full time allowed on his laywer (who they kept waiting) seems a little unresonable as a result. 

It's the worst kind of crap, the police are (as shown in the first link) facing calls from the terrorism legislation watchdog to answer why he was head for 9 hours as that was unusual. The police have only responded with ""we think what we did was legal"" and have no point tried to talk about having to wait for a lawyer.

In short typical dm bullshit that only exist to confirm the basis of their readership who exist in a vacuum of ignorance.  ",0,1377158859,null,0,1377159517,0,cbsw1gf,t3_1kuy0q,t1_cbsw1gf,t1_cbsuy85,null,1429741846,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

My reasoning is I am worried that putting an extra man at the back would change completely the play upfront/midfield due to one less player. And Villa's counter attacks are mostly not long-balls to Benteke from the back line, but they always look to dispossess opponents in the midfield and start from there.  

Another interesting strategy is the U21 match vs Man U recently. I didn't watch the match but I read a report somewhere that we used long-ball quite frequently to bypass their midfield and tire their wingers. 

Anyway, the tactical battle should be interesting, but I reckon BR would stick with the 433 shape but with different kind of fullback-midfield play. ",0,1377159965,null,0,false,0,cbsw75u,t3_1ktx8f,t1_cbsw75u,t1_cbsv68d,null,1429741772,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

If you're the adventurous type, go travelling. If not, try to find a job (any job, it doesn't have to be your ideal career). Either of those choices will give you a vastly different perspective on life, and after a year or two you might well find that you're able to tackle maths again with renewed enthusiasm, and carry on with your university goals.

I don't think we need too much added to be competitive.  I hope the club back the manager and the team now.

On the plus side :

&gt;Yes those players have good skills on the ball but it's their off the ball skills that set them apart.

Being a defensive midfielder doesn't mean your only footballing skill is being able to tackle, and reducing DM's to that is a straw man. Successful DMs these days read the game well, can shuttle the ball between defensive and attack, have great positional skill to help them not only tackle, but also intercept and being in place before an attack really gets going.

The DM is an especially important and specialised position in a system like Rodger's, or the Barcelona system. Due to the height at which the full backs push up, the DM is often in effect a 3rd central defender for a lot of the time that the team has the ball, leading to a kind of 3-1-3-3/3-1-5-1 formation. Adapting and learning that position is difficult, which is why Lucas got so much stick when he was covering for Masc all those years ago, and why people gave Allen such a hard time at start of last year when he was covering for Lucas. It's *not* an easy position to play in, and is a highly specialised position, requiring very specific skills, hopefully at a rather high level. Gerrard can't do it properly, and he's one of the best players we have at reading the game.

So, the days of ""DM's"" who just tackle are certainly gone. But the days of any player who only has one skill (tackling, crossing, being a target man, etc.) are all numbered, *especially* in a system like Rodgers plays.

I want everyone to recognize that we beat a club, fair and square. I want the fans of that club to recognize that they were second best. That type of comment from an opponent is hard to see if their team is sub-par and at worst. 

Also, our definition of champion is different, so there is no need to discuss it. 

As for Arsenal comment, well that was just an example. I am more of a football fan than Chelsea fan, so if referee made bad call, I call it out irrespective of which side got an advantage. I can't see people getting injured, no matter which team they play for. If a team is losing because of injuries, I hate that as it was not anyone's fault. And no fitness team can have all players ready to play every week, so that is rather moot point. 

Remember the RM game with ManU last season. Mourinho actually went ahead and said that ManU was better team for the day, even though they lost. Does that mean, he is being too nice to them? Probably.

Assuming *one* of the children earnt a minimum wage of the *lower* bracket of £3.68, that child would need to work only 17 hours (rounded up) in a month in order to pay off the bedroom tax. With both children on it, that drops to 8.5 hours a month or 2.1 hours a *week*. 

Two children (one an adult, one nearly an adult), two minimum wage jobs, 2.1 hours a week - and the problem goes away. That's not committing infants to slavery for their lives, it's a relatively tiny amount of time to keep the home their mother needs.

Nick Clegg allowed his position in the current coalition to be set effectively based on his number of MPs.

Which is preposterous in terms of realpolitik, as the coalition needed BOTH parties to work. In reality there were two votes, Clegg and Cameron, and both had an absolute veto. Without either no legislation could pass.

Clegg, however, has consistently seemed to be incapable of hard nosed, cutthroat political assertion, but has rather been trusting and desperate to be liked, making the lib dems drastically less influential than their position holding the balance of power would have allowed. They seem to have overpriced the value of cabinet seats, in comparison to being allowed to sign off on legislation.

This will remain as long as Clegg is leader, which will probably be for some time IF they stay in government. Or no time at all if they don't. 

Arguably it makes him even weaker in the next coalition negations, as a failure to enter coalition will mean the end of his career, giving him an incentive to surrender everything, just for a cabinet seat.

But we make exceptions in the case of whistle-blowers, because that kind of information is necessary for the public good. And what good are our laws if they are not ultimately applied for the public good?

In the corporate world, pretty much anyone working in any company that has patents, financial information etc etc has to sign NDAs, agreeing to never take company owned information without permission to a 3rd party, even if they leave the company. But if the company is doing something illegal, or morally reprehensible, it can no longer be protected by the NDAs.

I believe that the same should apply to governments. We all agree that governments do need to keep secrets from time to time, for the sake of public safety. But if the government oversteps its mandate and begins to abuse its power (which is pretty much inevitable), then we must rely on whistle-blowers to reveal the abuse of power.

In this case, I think we can all agree that the governments have seriously overstepped the bounds in invading our privacy, so the information that Snowden and his friends are revealing to the world is definitely for the sake of the public good. Therefore, this information can no longer be considered protected by any NDA or confidentiality agreement.

This is not a 'small part' of fascism, considering this is the economy.

If they were spectacularly ugly, I'd probably admire the attempt, at least.

Number four... Yup, shit. It just seems like a loophole around 'facade protection'. I don't think there's much point in protecting old buildings if you're just going to slice the front of and prop it up. If a murderer wore my girlfriend's face as a mask, I wouldn't want to kiss it.

There's a building near me that's been rebuilt, but they kept the facade by just putting new windows through the old ones and continuing the wall 'up' at the top. It looks as though the old building has been 'embossed' onto the new one; it's not hugely pretty, but it's a much better way of doing it, and is probably the best reasonable approach.

As for the lighting levels on 4... The appeals judge ruled that the 'student lifestyle' meant that they'd only sleep in the rooms, therefore didn't need the light. I spent most of my student life in my room (I wasn't particularly sociable)! I enjoyed standing at the window, and made me feel a bit less isolated from the world. To have a wall feet away would have been horrible. Fine, poke fun at the student stereotype of sleep-library-club, but don't make legal rulings based on it!

true,ActionPriest,null,null,"An unemployment rate hovering around 20% means that you can't just go and *get* a job, because most jobs are filled, without much turnover. That means when jobs do come up the number of applicants are overwhelming, and go to older people, with more experience, and, more importantly, more flexibility.

For a minumum wage flexibility is pretty much the most important factor, and these kids don't have that as they have to work around school.

To be honest, speaking from someone living in the south-west/south* at the moment, and from person experience of extensive searches, its pretty much impossible to get a minimum wage job unless you can declare that you are available all the time. They can easily find someone who is fully flexible, so there is no reason to hire someone who is only available on weekends, or in the evening. Evening if they are only offering 16 hours a week, or less, they want it to be when they need you.

Moreover they are also very often looking for people to commit long term, eg a year or more, so 

The days when a kid could just go and get an evening job at McDonalds, are long dead. Those jobs are filled by people doing that as a career, many trying to feed families.

Personally ultimately I WAS able to compromise, because I am a graduate student, with only a few hours of seminars, and can rearange things with a supervisor. But that has informed missing classes/important meetings. And I had relevant industry experience, and certificates. And that took some time. The notion of a 17 year being able to do it is frankly laughable. And again this is in a MUCH lower unemployment area than these kids are.

For a 17 year old, expecting them to be able to find a flexible minimum wage job within a few months is INSANELY naive. Its really not at all realistic at the moment. Its also kind of insulting and high handed to people going through this particular hell because they weren't subjected to it at teens.

I certainly, in many months of work have NEVER met a teenager working at McDonalds. And thats in several locations, and in an area which is doing incredibly well in terms of jobs. This is not to say there aren't 16-19 year olds working, there clearly are, but that the opportunities are excruciatingly hard to come by, certainly in a short time.

It being unlikely to be able to find a job meeting specific requirements in a few months doesn't necessitate that that there is ""no work for anyone""

We could and would spend beyond our means if the risk is beneficial on more than a single front, though it will always come down to what profit is being made. Which in the Bale case is true, win-win as it is. Spurs are getting so much US composure it's not funny (Dempsey isn't even needed now!), all through media exposure from Bale being linked with a record bid. People think we developed the player from youth!

We will rock this year, with or without Bale but it will take until November to really hit some kind of stride. Nevertheless, we will make money on the sale from mutliple directions, excluding Real Madrid.

No matter if we sell him, we've spent a title challengeing amount in comparison to Chelsea circa Roman's arrival, without adjusted inflation. That's a tonne of money, but nothing compared to the baron-weight.

Then Clegg did say something the next day, and it was that he supported smashing up the hard drives.

Now Clegg is coming out with this fudge (still backing the destruction and intimidation but not backing the 9 hour detention).

Sorry but that just stinks of behind the scenes informal discussion between Rusbridger and Clegg to bring an end to this episode.  The guardian will stop releasing any more info on state surveillance and wear the disk destruction as a badge of honour, at the same time as criticising the tory part of the coalition whilst being able to hold Clegg up as a man of words (because he's nothing more than that, just words). They can't continue their criticism of schedule 7 because that would mean they can't back Cooper to be next labour leader (EdM is dead in the water now).

&gt; I'm not naive enough to claim it - but to all the naysayers in this thread saying that it's impossible

No one is saying that. Thats a preposterous strawman you keep on raising.

They are saying it is incredibly difficult, takes time, and its not something you can just go out and do at short notice. You have presented it as an obvious, fast and easily available resolution. This dispute has been going on a very short time, and has been made shorter still by the council starting proceedings early.

As I said elsewhere, there is a WORLD of difference between the being ""no work for anyone"" and job searches being a long, drawn out, challenging affair, with no quick or even likely resolution, with jobs few and highly competitive.",0,1377169660,null,0,1377171018,0,cbsxgw3,t3_1kv2vv,t1_cbsxgw3,t1_cbsxcje,null,1429741180,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Evra would definitely get a spot, Enrique would certainly have some work to do to get that spot back.

Rooney... not sure. Obviously a highly talented individual, but does he fit our squad? He could possibly replace Sturridge up front, but he certainly wouldn't beat Suarez to that spot, assuming that's where we will play Suarez when he returns (I think its more likely that he'll play on the wing). Rooney is an assist machine, and seems to play best sat just behind the forward. In our team this would mean replacing Coutinho or pushing him out to the wing... not convinced.

Valencia, no problem. Even if Downing were still around, he wouldn't get game time with Valencia about.

Kagawa (although he has been used on the wing a lot by United) is best suited to #10... another Coutinho replacement. You'd be moving a player who does better in the center to the wing, which is what United have been doing with Kagawa, and tbh I'd prefer Coutinho.

So while their players are all fantastic, I don't think it's as clear cut as you make out.

We only bid 30 million due to his release clause. And if we had to pay another 5 mill, that would be grossly overpaying for him.

However..

&gt; No one is saying that. 

Actually, several people have said that. Go and read. I agree that it's preposterous but when I suggested that one or even both of her children find work to fix this serious issue, I wasn't expecting to be told that 'it's not as easy as that' over and over as though that somehow means I'm wrong to suggest it. 

&gt; They are saying it is incredibly difficult, takes time.. 

Perhaps it is difficult and perhaps it does take time - but if (the family) are so close to the breadline that £62 is the difference between their mother losing her home - or not - perhaps they should have started looking sooner? 

The family are £248 in arrears - that's four months at £62. The article doesn't tell us if anyone tried to find work or for how long they were looking - but they ought to have been looking for at least four months by now, wouldn't you say? 

It's not necessarily fast - there is surely some luck (and intelligence) involved - but it *is* obvious. Regardless - two people searching for work for four months would hopefully have lucked out on *something* and if not - isn't that something else the article could have added to show just how tough times are there?

It's also a good way of learning about the scientific method - in my experience, the psychology students understood ""how science works"" better than the physics students in my sixth form.

I haven't heard any complaints from the politics students at my school either.

This is a good point. While I am most obviously referring to the Willian deal, I get the impression that this has been one of the reasons for us failing to get/reach an agreement with the clubs for the Micky and Costa deals as well. There's been a lot of contradictory information about the deals this summer, but some of them have said that we've agreed terms a few times, but not even bid, or not come close to the bid that clubs require. It's anyone's guess which of these reports are true, but t£10m seems a hell of a lot given the context of these other deals for someone who may or may not turn out to be a good player in 2-4 years time. £3m? Fine, sure. £6m? Pushing it, but acceptable. £10m? High risk.

Also, the excuse that the restrictions on English and Welsh players is being used as an excuse for putting a premium on the kids price doesn't hold. This restriction is on players trained in English and Welsh clubs under the age of 21? 22?

2) Kids are extremely bright and creative, don't enjoy the slow monotony of school and would much rather get out there into the real world and achieve great things.

No, no one has said that. I think it is you who needs to go and read.

You are making an immediate equivalence between people criticising your offhanded suggestion that it is straightforward with people saying there are no jobs at all. Not one single person has claimed it is impossible,or that there are no jobs at all, as you keep insisting.

What people are trying to say is, that in the current jobs market, assuming that because people haven't found jobs in a few months that they are dossers, who aren't trying, is kind of a dick move. 

It may be the case that they are not. But in an article describing someone who was sick, I would never automatically assume it was because they were not seeking treatement if the article did not mention their seeking treatment.

Indeed this article makes no mention of this woman's attempts to recover from disability, but you have not criticised her for her failure to seek therapy or sugrergy and find work in all the years she has been supported (the two years to arrange her house initially for example).

Yet people, in a period where jobseeking is incredibly difficult, especially for this demographic of people, moreso than it has been for generations, are incredibly quick to presume that, a priori, if they are unemployed and financially struggling it is of their own choosing. 

If one is to presume either way, I think that is completely the wrong way to go at this point in time.

To OP's question. I am not worried, it is naive to expect that Arsenal won't bring in 2-3 players, probably 1-2 upgrades on the first team as well as some depth. If it isn't Di Maria, then it will be someone else equally as good.

I don't think they have a chance at Benzema. He is the only senior striker on the books and Liverpool aren't stupid enough to sell them Suarez if they know it will just mean Benzema ends up at Arsenal, a situation they fought tooth and nail to avoid earlier this very same window.

The way I see it Arsenal need a striker (hence Higuain, Suarez and now Benzema), a DM (Song replacement and injury issues right now) and a winger. On top of that they need to add some depth to the backline (although the starters are probably okay).

&gt; ..in the current jobs market, assuming that because people haven't found jobs in a few months that they are dossers, who aren't trying, is kind of a dick move...

I'm not assuming that, I don't think I've used the word 'dossers' once outside of this post. What I *have* said is that the amount could easily be covered with some work - and have the children tried this route? The article mentions that they're in college but nothing else. 

The article itself is heavily sensationalist, mentioning her children in the first line allows the reader to assume that these must be people incapable of fending for themselves when - in reality - they're old enough to do so. *The article does not mention if they are or are not looking for work, that is bad journalism and a detail that should be covered*. 

In not covering that fact they actually miss out on a trick. If the children *have* looked for work without success then they can further engage the reader by incorporating the plight of the job-seeker in these hard times into the story. Plenty of folks can identify with the fact that it's tough. ""Now these poor kids who have been trying to help their disabled mum whilst going through college have tried hard for months without finding work"" - they can think. 

However if they have *not* looked for work or a way to help their mother out with this situation - they should reflect on how this could help in a very real sense. 

It's that clear cut. The rest of us shouldn't need to apologise for questioning it when it's not reported on in the first instance. 

You're having issues with how easy (or hard) it is to find work being questioned - but go on to assume that I (or anyone else) have never had it that tough. Yes, the situation is brutal and soul destroying but that is the situation. You can ask for pity for yourself on your own time - but *in this article* there's no mention of anyone's efforts to find work and bring more money into the family. I am not calling them dossers - I am questioning the facts and whether this obvious option has really been explored.

Two kids aged 17 and 19 both at school. They're out of uniform now but they still need books, stationery, travel money, clothing. They could work a part time job, but the article doesn't say what's happening there. The father should be paying a portion if they're living with her full time, however if they're living with him, it could be her who's paying child support?

Is £25 per week right for clothing? Yes absolutely! Being immobile means there is a greater need for hygiene and it's a human right (or should be) to basics like clean clothing. Maybe she could go to the cheapie outlets and maybe she still does... we have other bills to consider...

£25 per week for utilities is far from generous. I have a three bed house and I pay £27.50, however I don't keep it heated during cold winter days when only I am in the house because it can double the gas bill! I also don't have a mobility chair to charge or other specialist electrical devices. I also don't have any kids.

It also doesn't count any loans, credit cards etc. Now I know these are theoretically low priority debts when compared to rent, but you try telling them that as they add £50 charges plus interest every month and start calling you 10 times per day!

We should give them all mobile phones, for a physically challenged adult, this could be a life line and therefore essential.

Hair dressing for women isn't cheap, ok it doesn't come up often, but is expensive when it does.

Also don't forget that she needs things to do.

I don't blame the council, they are following Westminster's rules. But Wesminster's rules do not accommodate real people.

true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","&gt; You haven't addressed my point as to why you did it selectively with employment of the youngsters, and not with the case of the mother seeking recovery or treatment.

The work had already been done to make the flat suitable for her use as a disabled person. Treatment would take time and she'd *still* be expected to pay 'bedroom tax'. Treatment or recovery would be fantastic for her quality of life - but would still leave her in debt.

One adult of 19 and one child of 17 finding work is a more immediate fix for the problem at hand - paying bedroom tax or facing eviction. It's a horrible situation, but objectively fixes the immediate issue. 

The reason the first assumption is that a person isn't trying - unless it's proven that they are - is because there are no details to go on. I've known people to consider ""trying"" as sending one job application a month, visiting an agency when that doesn't work and complaining on Facebook that they can't find work. Others send 15 applications a day, visit multiple agencies and actively target companies to find employment - some even come up with new business ideas or sell possessions they don't need to tide themselves over. 

Why should I waste time making assumptions like that and concocting convenient stories to make it seem as though those poor kids have been trying when - in reality - they might not? *We just don't know*. 

*My* first hand experience is exactly that. Some job seekers have been looking for ages and just had no luck - it happens. Others went on holiday for 6 months then argue they really were trying to find work. It's case-by-case. Don't assume that they have done anything to help themselves until it's shown that they did.

If we were to move Ade or JD, then LfD isn't a bad choice to fill out the strikeforce.  Soldado is going to be the starter and either JD or Ade (seems like Ade is most likely to move) is going to be the first off the bench.  Well, Soldado is 28, Ade 29 and JD about to turn 31...Leandro fucking Damiao is 24 and has some talent and is a complete change of pace to Soldado. 

He would allow us to start overhauling the strikers so that you constantly have the primary threat (Soldado), the cagey veteran (Defoe) and the player entering his prime (Leandro fucking Damiao). As the years pass you can cylce the strikers in this manner like a conveyor belt and always ensure you have talent.

Before when we were looking at LfD we were looking at him as the primary striker...big risk to take on an unproven kid from Brazil. Now we have Soldado, we don't have to rely on the unproven striker from Brazil as our major threat just as another contributor albeit one with pretty solid potential. Additionally the Inter president seem to be begging us to come make a bid.  The Napoli deal seems to have fallen apart, the Southampton one won't happen now that they have Osvaldo and i don't think Liverpool have ever really been in for him.  We don't in truth need him so as the window closes a cheeky bid for him could result in us actually getting him so that Inter can cash in on the player that they thought would make them a boat load of cash but is becoming the item in the store they can't find anyone to buy.

It's not right that just because we are worried that the kids should be as well.

 They don't know what it's like to find out that for the last year they changed it so water rates are no longer coming out of your rent and suddenly you have a huge bill, or and this is my current thing, how much it costs to re-paint a house.  Then there is the general wear and tear, your hoover breaks (£120 although I have a tip on that one), your iron gets knocked onto the floor (£25), your microwave goes boom (£50), you need a new  set of crockery (£25) and so on.

I know I had no clue how to read a gas meter until I left home, and here's the thing, leaving home and living in your own place or with a friend is *hugely* different to living in a 3 bed with children.  The bills are a lot cheaper and some are often included in the rent so it's not a financial shock *plus* you usually have a safety net.  If you fuck up you can ask your parents for help or go  crash on a friend's sofa without the responsibility of having children to worry about.

It's not if you want to accuse him of ""cyber-warfare.""  Even if he did crack anything it's a huge stretch to call it ""cyber-warfare.""  Copying stuff from one USB stick to another does not a cyber warrior make.

&gt;If you look at the methods crackers use they use social engineering to gain high level user credentials so they don't have to do a great deal of cracking.

Worked in IT all my life, so yeah I'm aware of methods of hacking and cracking - irrelevant here though; part of the huge uproar was the level of security clearance Snowden had.  He didn't need to steal information from anyone; he had it all.

That outlines the illegal methods the government has been using to spy on domestic and foreign citizens.  Squarely in the public interest I'd say.

My views require some explaining, whilst I believe that women should be allowed to work, I also believe that the traditional family structure of one person going to work and one person staying at home is the best structure. The reason I say person and not man and woman, is due to yourself being gay, and there not being a man and woman in your hypothetical household so to speak.

Having someone who stays at home all day has huge advantages, something that really showed me this was the royal wedding a couple of years a go. On the BBC news they were talking about the lack of street parties, and how the decline in housewives has seen a s huge decline in social society as a whole.

I don't know exactly what a solution is, it is a tough question to say the least. Ideally, man goes to work, woman stays at home, or in the case of homosexuals who have no children, it's not an issue and they can both work without fear of a child being a burden on there working life.

Definitely can't dispute that, but don't feel that it's entirely necessary if you'd rather give yourself a bit of balance (if you're already taking 2 or 3 other sciences for example) or pursue other subjects at A-level. 

I took Chemistry, Biology and French at A2 (along with History as far as AS) and am now in my final year of an Information Systems degree, which is similar to CS but with a couple of programming modules swapped around – for business modules instead, in my case. We still share the same software engineering, world-wide-web and database modules along with a couple of others and so far I haven't encountered anything that I'd say I'm at a particular disadvantage at from not taking IT or Computing at A-level (or even at GCSE for that matter). 

Some of my course-mates who took computing-related subjects at A-level did have more prior experience working with things like HTML, CSS, Java, Javascript, SQL etc. but the teaching format at university wasn't reliant on any degree of prior knowledge so it was still easy enough to pick things up. If anything, it also meant that the first year was slightly more engaging for me than it was for them as I wasn't having to deal with as much repetition.

Check the course entry requirements for the universities you're applying to though.

Not really. I'm sure I'm not alone when I say that I've not once been asked to produce my GCSE results since I received them (bar applying for A-levels, where it turned out I would have been accepted regardless). I don't even remember which ones I have. Years later at university, careers advisors actively told students not to waste space by putting their GCSEs on their CV, and I've seen recruiters mock applicants for including them.

I spoke to an HR interviewer at my workplace and he said it boggled his mind why he finds so many itemised lists of GCSE results with their respective grades when reading through CVs, ""as if they were relevant or important"". 

If you have no other qualifications and are looking for a minimum wage job in the service industry, GCSEs *may* factor. But in these situations, what employers really want is experience.

&gt; You gain nothing from not trying with your GCSEs. You potentially gain a lot from doing well in them.

This is true. The difference is that for most people, the effort put in to getting those 10 As (or whatever the benchmark is) won't match the long-term returns.

When we tried before we were the only people in and we desperately needed a striker.  Now Inter has flirted with Napoli for a big money move only to be seemingly blown off. When Southampton was in for him they kept trying to get us or Napoli to come in for him, lots of talk of Southampton is a good club but we think a ""bigger team (batting eyes at Levy) is a better situation for him""...but we have dutifully ignored them and then went out and got a big time striker.  Now Inter is coming to the realization that the player they thought would make them a huge sum of cash has a very small market and all their fighting and utter bullshit has hampered their ability to sell off a huge ticket item.  

So for Spurs, go in make a £12m-£15m offer at the end of the window maybe get Inter to move as they realize their market is non-existant and the player realizes that he may not have as many options in Europe with the way Inter are handling it.

Dunne was superb from 08-10 as you mentioned but towards the end of 10/11 was injured for quite a bit. 11/12 was a difficult season for Dunne as mainly he was injured for large parts of it. I believe he was only actually fit for 4/5 games but as Lambert was introducing his own thing he preferred Vlaar, Clark and Baker. (Similar to what we saw with Bent, Given and Ireland). To be entirely honest he just seemed to be off the radar for the entire season. I think we all expected him to leave at the end of the season and I wish him all the best at QPR.

Here's the deal. It's depressing and soul destroying not to have the option of having anything nice, *ever*, with no hope of this ever not being your life.  The fact is that a nice £500 table will last forever where as a shit £100 table may last you a few years before the legs fall off which means that if you don't have the means to save up £500 for a table you end up spending far far more long term.  The same goes for everything from ovens to TVs to sofas.

We are not on JSA, we are on long term ""you are fucked mate"" benefits. I know my children will never be able to go on holiday for two weeks, we can't camp and we can't go to a caravan and a hotel with a four person family room with it's own bathroom is the only option for us and a hotel is way way out of our price range.  There is no hope, there is no ""well what if you do X"", there is just the fact that we can't ever go on holiday. 

Now imagine you are a teenager and you are into gaming, like my son, we don't have a gaming PC and he can't work to get any extra for playstation games so he has to wait and wait until the second hand prices drop below £10, which is just *wonderful* if you are into a game like COD or Halo, and it will never not be like this for him. 

edit: should be noted that we need to do stuff all day like anyone else, but we are housebound and he can't read so TV and gaming are actually the cheapest option given that they shut down all of the day club things in our area owing to lack of funding.

Decisions, decisions! 

Really, though, you should go if you get the chance. The Italians (and, let's face it, all the other fans) are completely bonkers and it's a great weekend. If you buy a general admission ticket, the open pitlane on thursday afternoon is amazing: I saw Vettel and Webber; De La Rosa was the coolest guy, having his photo taken with the fans. Also saw the Caterham team practising tyre changes. Didn't see Alonso or Massa as there was a bit of a bottleneck near the Ferrari garage, as you can imagine.
Monza is also great, as (if you're in gerenal admission) you can usually get onto the track as soon as the race has finished. I was under the podium in 2003 when Schumi was spraying champagne at the crowd.

I guess there are two arguments here. First that Hazard was somewhat stationary when the ball was played. Secondly that his movement was also somewhat horizontal along the pitch.

Now obviously, the play in question looked like what would constitute a through ball. But football statistics are somewhat speculative when labelling plays is involved. For many this would constitute a through ball, for many it would constitute a pass. You cannot just debunk a statistical analysis because interpretation was different.

Radio exists as a medium to help people relax, or inform them. You use the radio to keep abreast of world news. You could call someone a 'radio user', but it would sound very odd. We call them 'radio listeners', or 'someone who listens to the radio'. The same connotations apply.

Television user. Television viewer. Book user. Avid reader. Music user. Music fan. These terms already exist with no negative baggage.

Moreover, of course, porn is a taboo subject, so the effects of using unusual language with negative connotations is magnified greatly. 

So, to answer ""What would you prefer?"" - the common grammar associated with the medium.

More information is available here: http://www.study.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/colleges/choosing.html but note that that page has some specific notes to do with undergraduate admissions which can be ignored.

&gt; What is it like being a part-time grad student at Cambridge? 

Unknown.

&gt; Are the programs so selective that applying would just be a waste of time?

I don't really see what you mean here. Obviously if there are 10 places available then the best 10 people will be selected and so in that sense it is infinitely selective. Are you asking if it is competitive? I've no idea how good you are or what your financial situation is. If both of those are 'reasonably good', then apply. Imposter syndrome mandates that you will rate yourself too low and so for your purposes 'reasonably good' means 'not entirely rubbish'.

&gt;  Should I be doing anything specifically before I even apply, like contact professors, or is that overkill?

http://www.ice.cam.ac.uk/mst/prospective-mst-students/how-to-apply/applying

It may seem surprising but we rarely leave off important precursor steps when providing explicit guidance. If you want to contact someone and ask a specific question which is not answered on the website then there is both an administrative and academic contact address listed on the course website.

Attempting to schmooze department members is unlikely to work. I ignore 80% of the email I get from people I know, let alone people I don't.

Everything you were saying seemed to entail that due to it being outside the borders of your country, you didn't even *care*.  I mean, that's pretty cold.  Maybe you didn't mean it in that way though.  To be fair - it's not like I'm up at the crack of dawn campaigning for homosexual expression in Russia every day, I personally have actually done fuck all to help the homosexual rights issues in Russia... but that's not because I don't *care*.

/u/biscuitsarefodunking nailed it when he said;

&gt;You have draw a line where you accept something is a problem beyond your control.

There's a difference between accepting you can't do anything at the present moment, and not even caring about it.  

The way you used the word 'us' was also raised by someone.  It was a very good point.  From everything you said it was pretty clear that you mean 'us' to be 'the British', and 'them' to be 'the Russians'.  So what I took away from what you said was;

You don't care about the oppression of homosexuals in Russia, because they're not British.  

Honestly mate, I don't think I did exaggerate on what you were saying at all.  Perhaps you didn't mean to communicate exactly what came across, but actually looking at the specifics of what you said, it really does sound like you just don't care about them because they're not British.  

And in answer to your original question - no - that doesn't really make you *bad* as such.  But it certainly doesn't make you good, and it does give the impression that if you were in a situation where you *could* do something good regarding the issue - you probably wouldn't because 'it doesn't affect us at all'.

Again, not accusing or exaggerating.  That's just what it looks like from reading what you said.

That's pretty sad man.  I hope you're OK.  

I will say - reddit is a totally vicious place to be if your opinion does not fall directly in line with the majority opinion.  That being said - accurate expression is everything in this place - and it really does help to be fair and accurate when explaining your case - which is easier for some and not for others.

There's loads to do/look at on reddit - if you're limiting yourself to serious debate on contentious issues - that's a recipe for feeling disconnected - especially if you have views that go against the grain.  

There are of course more important things than a persons right to declare himself gay - the right to life for example - which is being flouted in a pretty serious way in Syria right now - something else I can't do anything about.  But again, if it's something that you don't think is hugely relevant, or useful to talk about - then don't.  It's your thread were talking on buddy :)

If your susceptible to advice, I would suggest you get off the main subreddits for a little while - go look at some goofy stuff.  Also, avoid major league news outlets.  A while ago I went on a 3/5 month news famine, and after a few weeks I actually started feeling significantly better.  My world got a little smaller - because I wasn't being transmitted terrible information about places I am unlikely to ever go to - and I was happier - because I wasn't being transmitted terrible information about places I am unlikely to ever go to.  it sounds stupid, but it really worked for me.

Now I just skim the news every now n then, 1/2 times a week, just so I don't miss anything massive like - Africa sinking... or something.  

Anyway - hope that helps.  I have some pretty unpopular views too, and the best vent for them is to have a decent discussion with a someone who knows your not literally Hitler over a pint at the local.  If you really are starting to feel detached from your world, that's a sign that something needs to change, and the change is going to come from you - you'll do yourself no favours by sinking deeper.

They have been saturated in the game all their lives and many, but certainly not all, people on this sub reddit would seem to be newer comers to the world of football.

Their opinions are no less valid, though at times can seem a little naive.

I hesitate to say it but yes. It's a macho, beer drinking, generally sexist and masculine culture where football is concerned. I love the team and I love going to games, but to be surrounded by so many 'manly men' can be pretty intimidating as a woman, nevermind the 'banter' which is up there with reddit shittery of sexism and homophobia. Other entertainment does not tend to have this kind of viewership/fan base, I'm thinking TV and films etc, it's more open to women so more balanced or less 'macho'. I would liken football fans to boxing fans in this respect, and it was only recently that a boxer came out publicly. As for it being the fans in football I think absolutely so - footballers know which fellow footballers are gay or in a relationship with other men, they just don't out them because the result could be tragic.

We already had an openly gay footballer in the premiership, and it didn't turn out so well if you remember.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;That's pretty sad man. I hope you're OK.

OK. Is a relative term. Let's go with ""I think, therefore I am.""

&gt;I will say - reddit is a totally vicious place to be if your opinion does not fall directly in line with the majority opinion. That being said - accurate expression is everything in this place - and it really does help to be fair and accurate when explaining your case - which is easier for some and not for others.

You see, that's the absurdity of it; it's not even down to accuracy. People attack you for simply saying ""I don't care for homosexuality"" - they don't stop to consider for a moment that *two* of my idols in life are *extremely* gay (monsieurs Mercury and Fry) - it's just that sexuality doesn't enter the equation for me, and when it does, I shudder when I think about the mechanics of it.

&gt;There's loads to do/look at on reddit - if you're limiting yourself to serious debate on contentious issues - that's a recipe for feeling disconnected - especially if you have views that go against the grain.

I spend a lot of time in the comic book forums and sci fi.

&gt;There are of course more important things than a persons right to declare himself gay - the right to life for example - which is being flouted in a pretty serious way in Syria right now - something else I can't do anything about. But again, if it's something that you don't think is hugely relevant, or useful to talk about - then don't. It's your thread were talking on buddy :)

You see - Syria I have an opinion on. That's important, and I genuinely believe our aid should be limited to food drops, irrespective of which side they're taking.

&gt;If your susceptible to advice, I would suggest you get off the main subreddits for a little while - go look at some goofy stuff. Also, avoid major league news outlets. A while ago I went on a 3/5 month news famine, and after a few weeks I actually started feeling significantly better. My world got a little smaller - because I wasn't being transmitted terrible information about places I am unlikely to ever go to - and I was happier - because I wasn't being transmitted terrible information about places I am unlikely to ever go to. it sounds stupid, but it really worked for me.

I've stopped reading the news. I've been feeling disconnected for a year now, and it just makes the feeling worse. *Before* I was merely annoyed.

&gt;Now I just skim the news every now n then, 1/2 times a week, just so I don't miss anything massive like - Africa sinking... or something.

&gt;Anyway - hope that helps. I have some pretty unpopular views too, and the best vent for them is to have a decent discussion with a someone who knows your not literally Hitler over a pint at the local. If you really are starting to feel detached from your world, that's a sign that something needs to change, and the change is going to come from you - you'll do yourself no favours by sinking deeper.

Ignoring problems won't solve them. You may very well say what's the point in sending millions to Africa, they need billions and even that won't be enough but on the other hand, millions mean hundreds of thousands of children can be better off. Not all of them but at least some.

It's about changing attitudes. Showing others strongly how we feel about it. Revolutions start like that!

Religious Studies and Citizenship Studies are completely different subjects with different exams, but are both considered a half GCSE in some circumstances, although that doesn't mean that 'RS and CS' is a full GCSE.

You can see last year's papers from one exam board [here](http://www.edexcel.com/migrationdocuments/QP%20Current%20GCSE/June%202012%20-%20QP/5CS01_01_que_20120516.pdf), [here](http://www.edexcel.com/migrationdocuments/QP%20Current%20GCSE/June%202012%20-%20QP/5CS03_3B_que_20120521.pdf), [here](http://www.edexcel.com/migrationdocuments/QP%20Current%20GCSE/June%202012%20-%20QP/5CS03_3A_que_20120521.pdf), and [here](http://www.edexcel.com/migrationdocuments/QP%20Current%20GCSE/June%202012%20-%20QP/5CS03_3C_que_20120521.pdf). Most of it seems to be common sense, but there are some questions which require knowledge of rights which teenagers might not have yet picked up naturally and I'd imagine they're taught how to examine sources in a similar way to History lessons.

In my school, IT and RS were the two half-GCSEs offered (although they required about the same amount - if not more - of effort as full GCSEs) so I'm going to guess that Citizenship was the alternative to IT.",0,1377187424,null,0,false,0,cbt29zt,t3_1kve5e,t1_cbt29zt,t1_cbt1zji,null,1429738865,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"If we're comparing players then we're talking about their ability, not which clubs they support or their egos.  If we're going to take those types of things into account then Suarez shouldn't be allowed near a Liverpool shirt ever again for all the bad things he's done during his time here and his antics this summer.  I bet we see him flying around the pitch banging in goals once his suspension is up though.

The context is that people are saying Liverpool players are better than United players, man for man.  That claim is just outrageous.  Obviously no 1 person is better than a team of players.  The sum of the United parts is clearly greater than the sum of the Liverpool parts though.  They're winning the league and challenging for major trophies every season while we fight for a spot in the Europa League.  I hate having to say that and I'm typing this with gritted teeth because I wish more than anything that we were better than them.  We're just not.  Not player for player, and not as a team performance/sum of parts.  We have a few players who are just excellent in their positions but if you mashed the 2 squads together and picked the best players, it would be mostly United ones.  Do you honestly think Enrique is better than Evra?  Or that Skrtel/Toure is better than Vidic?  How about Allen/Henderson compared to Carrick/Cleverly?  Or there's Nani/Valencia against Sterling/Aspas.  Do you honestly think that Sturridge is a better fit than RVP?  Rooney/Suarez is brutal, I think Suarez is a little better but Rooney is absolutely immense on his day too. 

Don't take this as me not supporting my club.  I'll support them to the death, but I can't be unrealistic about this.  I don't have rose tinted glasses to see through for this.  If we were as good as them individually and/or as a team then we'd be finishing above them.  Reality is that we're trying to get into the Europa League while they're collecting premier league titles and fighting it out in the Champion's League and challenging hard for domestic cups (though I really think we're capable of a great FA/Carling Cup run this season, possibly even a win).  They're not in the top 2 basically every season by sheer luck.

It would take me forever to tell you all the things they have done wrong on purpose as to keep his remains, but if youre interested you should definitely read what the High Court judge has said in his judgement. Page 5 is where the majority of his decision starts.

http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Judgments/king-richard-iii-permission-judgment.pdf

""Fifth, there is evidence that a plan to consult interested parties was mooted at an 
early stage by the University of Leicester, but then appears to have been quietly 
dropped. In an e-mail dated 25th September 2012, the Head of University of 
Leicester Archaeological Services (Mr Richard Buckley) wrote inter alios to the 
Head of Leicester Arts and Museums Services (Ms Sarah Levitt) another member 
of the University (Mr Richard Taylor) stating: “I accept that there are conflicting 
views of where the reburial should be and that these need to be taken into 
account.” Mr Taylor replied: “We should work together to make sure that we 
retain as much control as possible. I think that the question is ‘Leicester is the 
plan, are there reasons why not?’ rather than ‘Where should he be reinterred?’""


He really lambasts them for some of the things theyve done, the man was a king of England and Leicester is playing finders keepers with his remains, regardless of what the majority of his direct descendants want, his personal wishes himself, and the inadequacies of burying the last plantaganet king in a tiny Cathedral that wasnt even given Cathedral status until the 20th century.

If a persons body was identified on the moors, and it was discovered that they ahd desired to be buried somewhere else, you wouldnt consider just plonking them in the nearest church. Not to mention this guy is a massive part of English history who had huge connections to the North, primarily York.

Leicester University was organising the burial of him before they even identified his remains, and continued to plan his burial even after judges had asked for them to stop while the case was disputed.

The man had no connection to Leicester other than that he died there. He had commissioned a chantry in york Cathedral where 100 priests were to pray for his soul, and called York his home. I think the case is very sad and im glad the judge has seen that the way Leicester University is acting is unethical on many counts.

true,Yurilovescats,flair5,,"Lloris - Class personified. hardly anything to do but when called upon pulled off some amazing save.

Naughton - very solid. AVB likes him, and so do I. 

Daws - great performance with some excellent last ditch tackles.

Kaboom - great to see him back, very solid. Looked a bit tired at the end, but great news that he completed 90mins. Looked like he's still the player we all know and love.

Rose - good bombing forward, and made some good tackles in defence too. Still made too many errors, but kinda made up for it with the goal of the game.

Paulinho - looked shaky at the beginning, still getting to know the team - but once he settled he really excelled. Both breaking up attacks and moving the ball forward and got himself a goal too.

Capoue - Really, really impressed me. continued his ridiculous amount of interceptions, but also managed some fantastic dribbles. I think we may have got ourselves a new hero here.

Townsend - Fucking amazing. Provided much more penetration than Lennon usually does.

Siggy - Perhaps the worst in the team... didn't look bad, but I don't think he's happy out on the left and wasn't up to the same level as others.

Chadli - Looked excellent for his 30 minutes - pacey, strong and put in the best cross of the game.

Dembele - I thought he looked good. Not great, not bad, but good. Didn't penetrate a weak defence as much as I would have liked.

Soldado - took his chances the way a world class striker should. Great movement, really adds something to our attack... I'm starting to really like the guy.

MOTM: Townsend. Great goal great assists and great running all game.

I'm not saying ALL of their players are incredible, or that they have 25 world class superstars on their team.  I just think that they tend to have better players than we do.

If you murder one person, I can understand your point. Maybe you were in a bad place at the time and you are truly sorry for your actions. I can totally empathize with that.

If you murder two people...ok again I could give someone the benefit of the doubt.

But when do you stop?

What if you deliberately kidnap, rape, torture and murder 3 people. What then? Do you still give someone the benefit of the doubt?

What about Anders Brevik (sp?)? Who killed seventy people. He personally decided to take the lives of seventy people. What about him? Does he still not deserve to be punished for the rest of his life?

I completely get where you're coming from, I really do. I'm also of the viewpoint that many, no most criminals are the victims of unfortunate circumstances. Born into poverty, raised by horrible parents, got in with the wrong group of friends etc. I'm all for more effective rehabilitation programs instead of throwing people in prison for years on end. 

However some people are simply too dangerous to be allowed to exist in public. Yes they may have mental issues, yes they may have had a very very shitty upbringing. But if they can't play nice with other people then they need to be locked away, for the rest of their life if necessary. Even if that means keeping them in a secure mental health hospital and not a prison.

&gt; There comes a point when you have to look at this from an intellectual point of view rather than an emotional one.

There also comes a point when you have to let go of idealism and see the world for what it really is. Some people, whether through their own actions or not, are simply too dangerous to be allowed to live in normal society. 

EDIT: I'm a Police Officer. I deal with criminals every day, literally. I know what these people are like. Most of them are tragic cases, people who would have turned out much different if they'd only been given a better start in life. But some of them are just plain nasty, evil people.

I imagined it would be a single structure of 70 concrete octagons laid ontop of each other in rows, like I've seen elsewhere... the idea being small fish and shellfish can make breeding grounds where they can't be fished. **But** instead these are completely disperesed into about 7 rows of 10 blocks. It seems to me from the design and layout that their main function is not to contain shellfish but actually to prevent small boats being able to run their nets along that strip of water. Now you could argue that is a form of reef and that may be what its designer intended, but I suspect the government of Gibraltar had little interest in sustaining a small cluster of shellfish in a 300 x 300m patch of sea, and a much bigger interest in detering spanish vessels from their cramped airports vacinity and the waters they claim.

There is no way Jose will let Mata go or even Roman. He is our twice player of the season, one of the fan favorites and it is obvious that he is the base of our midfield for many years to come. He is the base of that trio as well which might turn into a foursome now.

More importantly Willian is not a replacement for Mata. If this logic was true then Willian would have to be a player like Mata or we would need to have someone replace Mata and the only one we have is Oscar and Chelsea will never rely solely on just 1 player after having such a deep midfield.

With the way things are going Moses is the player who makes the most sense and I can see Chelsea letting go of him. He is a quality player which is why United can use him as well. 

I do not see Mata leaving and stop believing these shitty articles. Chelsea are on the climb up and letting go of Mata is an even worse decision to the club than it looks to us even if it is to get a striker like Rooney who has a couple of years in him after which United will still have Mata and we will have nothing. 

The wages difference alone even ignoring the loss of talent makes this deal ridiculous. Chelsea would suffer a financial loss, backlash from the fans, come out on the wrong side in both the short and long term if we sell Mata.

Tell them you can't afford to live on your current wage, and you feel you are doing more than enough to deserve a higher one.

If you want to outright threaten to leave in order to try to get what you want, go ahead, but be prepared to follow through.

You'll have a super enthusiastic sociology teacher (mandatory class, but she is so enthusiastic about it all, bless her, and one of the reasons I changed from doing the Bsc in Psych to the MA in Psych with Socio.

There are not many societies at Napier, which is a shame. A bunch of sports socs, but not many (that I've found) other than that.

There'll be the new student union, which will be great if you're new and have no idea where to go, but there really are so many awesome pubs in Edinburgh that you could go to a different one each week and not be done with them all.

Unfortunately the psych classes involve getting a bus out to Sighthill campus, which you'll need a bus card for, but they're pretty easy to get your hands on, and worth the money if you're gunna use it 4 or more days a week.

Way back in 1999, Peter Caruana the 15 year almightiest and most honorable leader, agreed with the Spanish government into basically letting them fish in our waters, without any licenses, and with whatever nets.

Fast forward to now, and what you find is EVERYWHERE Spain's fishing fleet go, they overfish. Since 1999, there had been increased Guardia Civil incursions (whereby they also ignore Royal Navy order to leave BGTW... Gib territorial waters..), and for many it Gibraltarians (who we too love to fish, just not commercially with nets), it was high time the police took action against these Spanish fishermen.


There's probably no more than 15 dedicated fishing boats in La Linea and Algeciras (accross in Spain), that fish in Gib. There nets may or may not be legal, but we have confiscated illegal drag nets = nets which drag along the bottom of the floor and scoop up crustaceans and low swimming fish, again Google about the damage they cause.

About 30 years sago, Gib sank two old barges about 50 metres off shore on the east side. Today they're thriving with fish, and other creatures. It's not like we haven't done this reef-building before. And as you point out, so has Spain too - And a damn sight greater times, and at the EUs own expense.

The Spanish Government (and probably some Spaniards) are pissed off because they think they can make this whole ""Gib has no waters"" argument, and probably need some big smokescreen for now. I dunno what the resolution to all this is gunna be.

I've not heard that the reef is linked to bunkering at all, although that it a big seperate industry in Gib. Atleast if the Fishermen used Gillnets then they could fish perfectly over these blocks anyways - whether Gib should pay for these new nets is a different matter (and if it helps ease the situation, then id' be for it). Some Spaniards are theorising that the reef is actually a contiuation of the runway - not true.

On the other hand, as a journalist, this drives me nuts, so here goes a rant: whether or not an article has quotes or not is ***not*** a good indicator of whether or not the information in it is legitimate! Reporters get information all the time from sources that, at the source's request, they're allowed to report but *not allowed to quote directly or cite the source of*. The information in an article without any quotes might actually have come directly from the club's manager, or the player himself, but often reporters are told they can't say that.

Similarly, the fact that an article ***does*** have quotes is not an indication that it's reliable either. We all know managers, clubs, and agents all lie to the press, so even if someone has said something on the record and there's a quote, it could end up being bullshit.

If you want to know whether a news article is legit, stop looking for quotes and start looking at **who wrote it** and **for what publication**. Is it a BBC journalist with a good track record for transfer news? If so, the article's probably accurate even if there are zero quotes. Is it a goal.com report by some dude you've never heard of? If so, it's probably horseshit even if there *are* quotes (which they most likely got from some PR person and never actually heard the quoted person say).

**TL;DR Quotes are not a good way to measure whether an article is legit.** 

That said, I'm not saying *this* article's legit. I don't know a ton about the Metro or this reporter, but the fact that he covers so many different sports is probably an indication he doesn't have tons of football connections. But what I'm saying is the lack of quotes means nothing. He might have gotten this from directly Sacko himself, but as long as Sacko said it's on background, he can't say that or use quotes. 

(Of course, another way to tell if an article is legit is to ask whether the proposed transfer makes any logical sense in the first place...Many don't. In this case, all I can think is that he wants to go somewhere big where he's still assured a starting position bc of the world cup, and probably not many other clubs can offer that).

Although the structures have been on the site for about a century they had become overgrown and hidden beneath trees and shrubs. Lord George Sanger, the most successful circus entrepreneur of the 19th century, bought the land in 1874 as a headquarters for his circus empire and housed lions, elephants and various other exotic animals.  He was an eccentric millionaire renowned for being a smart dresser and had his base in Dreamland for about 30 years.

By 1905 the menagerie had gone and in 1919, eight years after Sanger died, the Hall by the Sea became Dreamland.

Are they worth the 5 years buildup?

But telling a stressed 16 year old that 'meh, whatevs, your GSCEs don't matter at all' is completely inaccurate and might also sound a bit insulting to some; 'hey, that thing that you've been really focused on and worrying about for the last 5 years - nobody gives a shit.'

Just a point - this isn't 'racism' - it's religious related insult, which is subtly different.

If he didn't appeal the firing, and the time period in which he can is passed, there's not much he can do. If he can still appeal it, then he should and explain the full circumstances - which would seem to be mitigating, as the muslim guy spraying his sandwich is a direct provocation and also brought the issue of his religion into the workplace in a way that started a confrontation.

If your friend had said 'I'm not Muslim so your rules don't apply to me and you have destroyed my property and that's out of order' he'd have been perfectly in the right to complain and have something done about it. He'd probably have been fine to call him a prick for it as well, because he was one in these circumstances.

Because he said 'muslim prick' then he's laying himself open to accusations of bigotry, but the religious element was relevant to why he had his lunch damaged and also his response to it.

That's probably enough to take to an independent appeal. He should certainly object strongly if he gets called 'racist' because this wasn't racism and the reference to religion was somewhat justified.

Edit: Just a bit more info- So public opinion of the United States Revolutionary War hit highs and lows in both the United States and in England.  Originally it was a rebellion and the purpose of the continental army was to try and sway the english into allowing for representation in parliment and a number of other concessions.  These concessions went everything from repealing subsequent taxes which stemmed from the failed stamp act to removing British troops to trade agreements and a big one was at one point the King George (the whatever) decided to ban all the local city councils who had considered themselves pretty much self governed since the 1600s.

He also doesn't have the pace to beat players on the outside.  There was one play today that he did very well knocking the ball past the defender, but he couldn't get around him and ended up losing it.  He just needs to play CAM.

Another problem I saw was players being slow to pass him the ball.  Not only him, but it is something I noticed more.  He gets open, a couple seconds pass, and then he gets it.  By that time the defenders close and his opening is gone.  Then it looks like he squandered possession when really he should have been getting the ball sooner.  Many times he has looked like the ""almost there"" player which kind of fits with our recent history.  He seems so close to pulling everything off but it just seems to fail somehow.

The obvious benefit is that as long as there is a moon, the tides will always happen, and are easily predicted, so that turbines in the dam can be activated.

Drawbacks include the cost of a dam as massive as the one I suggested would be huge and it would play havoc with the movement of sediment and the river bed, as well as the ecosystem. 

Sorry its not as comprehensive take on the subject, but eithout access to the sources I used, I don't to give any concise statistics, because I don't to mislead anyone with potentially wild inaccuracies.

I would have thought twice about posting this but it didn't happen to me, I heard it from the source however no names are included and lets be honest, she's doing a better job making a fool out of herself in public than this story is going to...

While working for an unnamed entity who provided support for the Home Office amongst others, one day, a secretary from Theresa May's department calls up for a password reset on her account. Even though this is blatantly against their own IT security policies, it's Theresa May, so it gets done. Helpdesk agent has supervisor reset the password and secretary scuttles off, comes back 2 minutes later to tell us the new password doesn't work. Cue this after another 3 resets and we start to wonder what the hell's going on. Turns out *immediately* after ordering one secretary to get her a password that ""works"", she had ordered the same thing to another secretary, who had called us up, who had got a different agent who had gone to another supervisor who had reset the password...

So back and forth these secretaries went, giving her password after password THAT THE OTHER SECRETARY JUST INVALIDATED BY HAVING IT RESET AGAIN. It seems she thought shouting at 2 people would get it done twice as fast.

Eventually the penny drops and we end the call with one of the two and reset the password a final time, to much laughter and head shaking.

*THIS* is the woman who currently holds one of the most prominent positions in the Home Office, an agency who are supposed to be stepping into the digital age to protect us all...

true,Olliemon,lincolnshire,Lincolnshire/Derbyshire,"I see you point, but I disagree with that in an empirical basis. You're right that we all too often call fitters engineers, but the people you speak of I would say are craftsmen, or technicians. An engineer, in both a modern and traditional sense is not somebody who does an apprenticeship and becomes a skilled metalworker - and believe me, I know many who have.

An engineer, rather is the person that designs and oversees the conception, construction and operation of a product from start to finish - and they may not have to actively take part in the fabrication of any of it (while the must obviously require a detailed understanding of the processes involved).

Furthermore, any modern engineer will tell you that this idea of a grimy looking bloke with a hard hat and a builders pencil behind their ear is beyond antiquated, a modern engineer works with 3d technologies - almost all drafting is entirely electronic nowadays, and the primary concerns of modern engineers are the safety and economy.

As a mechanical engineer, we try and make products and devices that are environmentally sound, and ensure the utmost safety for their users, whilst fulfilling strict design brief stipulations.

It isn't all heavy steel and lathes and micrometers anymore - but I am not dismissing that, rather it is an essential knowledge that all engineers are required to know according to the UKSPEC and the Council.

But no, while a machining expert or craftsmen may have spent a lifetime crafting things to perfection, they are by no means an engineer.

Also - to become a chartered engineer (the highest level of professional engineering awarded by a body [like mine, the IMechE]) it generally takes 8-10 years, 5 of which have to be spent in industry, and you have to make a significant contribution to your engineering discipline in order to be recognised.

&gt;I like Suarez, but in all honesty I think he may be coming through at the wrong time for us anyway. Suarez is 19, while Nasri, Silva, and Navas (who are all ahead of him in the pecking order) are all around 26-27. The seniors could all realistically have a good 5-6 years in them as the top choices, by which point Suarez will be 24-25 - would he honestly sit around or take loan deal after loan deal until that age to really stake his claim on a first team spot?

&gt;Also in the EDS we have Jose Angel Pozo, who I heard recently was top EDS scorer last season despite missing a good chunk of it through injury, and is only 17. Also not to forget Marcos Lopes, City's youngest ever senior goal scorer - also 17. These lads will be 22-23 by the time the current first choices are likely to start declining, by which point they'll likely have had a loan move or two under their belts, and will be itching to get going.

Two of those players are gone, with a £34 million pound loss, and the remaining one is slowly proving himself, but still not justifying the price tag. FSG is wealthy, yeah, but that doesn't mean they can throw money at whatever shakes it's ass in front of them. They've made some bad investments, and they're just being cautious, because that's what smart businesspeople do. And they're businesspeople by nature.

When they plan to spend hundreds of millions of dollars redeveloping Anfield? I genuinely believe that FSG care about the club -- why else would they buy a club who was admittedly on the brink of administration? That doesn't seem like hunting for a profit to me. FFS, people need to stop being so shortsighted. They're slashing the wage bill, yes, but that's to rebuild and come back stronger than before. They will be hesitant to pony up £35M after they've been burned in the past. We had a great January window, and a fairly good window so far, but it takes time to rebuild that trust after being screwed so badly.

true,Pikul,lfc87,null,"&gt; I'm sure since the Carroll, Downing, and Henderson fiasco's that the club have hired people with football expertise to decide whether the owners should put up the money.

It's uncomparable to be honest, Carroll was a panic buy after we got the Torres money and was bought by a manager who FSG felt was forced upon them. Paying 35 million for Carroll is not the same as stumping a few extra million for a proven quality player. Henderson was unproven and was massively overpaid for, likewise with Downing although he was somewhat proven in the league, All three were poor transfers under a regime that didn't seem to have a clear vision on how to move forward, I love Kenny, but I don't think he had a vision, for lack of a better term, for the club, obviously he wanted to push forward but I don't think he knew how.

FSG now have the manager they want, Rodgers doesn't seem to be the type to throw big money at players unless he genuinely believes they'll add something significant to the team. He's been here a year and has a team of scouts under him that have been putting reports together for the last year so he has a clear idea of what he needs. The fact now, is that FSG refused to pay a few extra million again for a player we clearly wanted, just like they did with Dempsey last year.

&gt;don't believe he would have been as perfect for the club as Rodgers is suggesting. He doesn't score goals and thats arguably the only issue I see with our side. We have plenty of creative chances. We need someone who can cooly finish those chances and Willian isn't that guy

What makes you think this? Rodgers has a greater understanding of what the team needs and he identified it in Willian, I'm not saying that we should blindly follow what the manager says, but when he's clearly upset over losing a player, it's not a case of ""ah we didn't need him anyways"" he clearly feels left down by the owners on this occasion.

Not every transfer can be a Coutinho or Sturridge, to get quality sometimes we are going to have to pay a little more over a players worth to secure him due to the position we are in.",0,1377212041,null,0,false,0,cbtced3,t3_1kwksr,t1_cbtced3,t1_cbtc1u4,null,1429734038,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

Most positions have hundreds of graduate applicants and even landing an interview is hellish. I've got a fairly good looking CV (resume) and it's still taken me over 4 months to land a promising interview. On top of that unless you can prove that you're eligible to live and work in the UK not many people will consider you. 

To put it in perspective, [a lot of British people are moving out of the UK for better job prospects.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10258081/Two-million-quit-Britain-in-talent-drain.html)

I don't say all of this to put you off - I just want to make sure that you have all the facts first. 

Details on how to get a visa:

1. A tourist visa that anyone gets when they visit allows for a 6 month stay **without working**. Be warned that you may be required to prove to a government official that you have enough money to meet your expenses for the duration of your stay (if you don't, the UK Border Agency has the right to put you on the next plane back to where you came from). You may also be required to show your return ticket. The longer your planned stay the more likely they'll question you about this.


2. To work for a U.K. company you'll need a work visa, but in order to obtain that, your employer must apply for you before you come to the U.K. If you plan to work for a British company, find your job before you leave.
3. The U.K. residency permit and visa system now operates on a points-system. The Tier 1 route is now only open to Entrepreneurs, Investors, Exceptional Talent and Graduate Entrepreneurs. Tier 2 is main route for work visas which must be sponsored by a U.K. employer. Tier 2 (General) permit providing they can demonstrate your job cannot be filled by a local worker. If you are transferring with your existing employer you can get a Tier 2 (ICT - inter company transfer) visa, otherwise the Tier 2 (General) permit requires a Certificate of Sponsorship (COS) from a U.K. employer who may be required to prove to the Border Agency that the job couldn't be filled by a British subject.

As for citizenship; that comes much, much further down the line:
&gt;The 'naturalisation' process:

You must have: 

1. lived in the UK for at least 5 years before the date of your application (unless your spouse or civil partner is a British citizen)

2. spent no more than 450 days outside the UK during those 5 years

3. spent no more than 90 days outside the UK in the last 12 months

4. been granted indefinite leave to stay in the UK, ie there’s no specific date that you have to leave

5. had indefinite leave to stay in the UK for the last 12 months (unless your spouse or civil partner is a British citizen)

6. not broken any immigration laws while in the UK

Also worth mentioning that marrying an individual specifically for the purpose of gaining citizenship will leave you in jail ;) 

tl:dr: The easiest way into the UK would be to find a job in the USA, but then ask for an inter-company transfer to a UK office. OR do your degree here.

Who knows if Allen will ever suit the needs of our club. He's soft. And even when Gerrard retires, we'll need to bring in a much tougher DM to accompany him, further true because Rodgers sees Coutinho needing to be in the 10 hole (which I agree with).

Basically, Rodgers had a fantastic January window. But two big signings he stumped for have not come good in the slightest and have shown no genuine signs they will (or that they'll fit our club). 

So I would say I don't agree at all that Willian is what we needed. Sure he was a LW, but he doesn't finish.

Sex before marriage was brought into it in RE classes and how it was wrong and not what God wanted etc.

I explained that women should be able to have an abortion after rape, incest etc. He explained it was still a sin to have an abortion and stuff.

The funniest thing though, in class when I used those arguments, the ProLife teacher said Women's bodies shut down after rape or incest so it's almost impossible to get pregnant after rape or incest. The exact same arguements that those crazy republicans used during the US election last year.

We were also taught that oral sex causes aids and stds, condoms were a sin and the best form or contraception was abstinence.

My tips would be to go into town during your first few weeks, and hand out cvs. You can construct a good cv without any experience - I'm assuming you did work experience at school? Most big retailers will want you to apply online, but it's still worth going in. Don't just give it to some random shopworker, ask for the manager. Put your CV in an envelope. Wear business dress. Go into small independent coffee shops/bakeries/restaurants and chat with the manager about your university situation. Be friendly, bubbly, persistent.

As for looking online, don't use the jobcenter website. Just don't. It's fucking useless. Any career advisor will tell you that. Write out a list of companies that have branches in your area, like WHSmiths, Costa, Starbucks, McDs (if you've got the bollocks), Waterstones, whatever. Visit each company website individually, go to the bottom, click 'careers', 'jobs', 'recruitment' or whatever and have a look. Check regularly. If they don't have anything, they might in a week, and all your student mates are probably looking too, so make sure you catch it.

I'm focusing on retail and hospitality here, but they're probably the best chance of work you'll have. If you're applying for food places and non-food, make seperate CVs for each.

true,ksturgis,null,null,"So I have a few thoughts on the points you've made, and let me preface these thoughts with the sentiment that Juan is far and away my favorite player, and I desperately hope we would never allow him to go to a rival club, especially fucking United. That said, I think there are several reasons that at least show some logic behind letting Mata go, and I'll address them via countering some of the arguments you made. 

&gt;There is no way Jose will let Mata go or even Roman. He is our twice player of the season, one of the fan favorites and it is obvious that he is the base of our midfield for many years to come.

This is merely a baseless belief that all Chelsea fans hope is true, but ultimately have zero indication of it being a reality. At the end of the day we have no idea what discussions are going on behind closed doors between Jose, the board and even Roman. 

&gt;Willian is not a replacement for Mata. If this logic was true then Willian would have to be a player like Mata or we would need to have someone replace Mata...the only one we have is Oscar and Chelsea will never rely solely on just 1 player after having such a deep midfield.

Correct, Willian is not a replacement for Mata and in fact does not possess many of the qualities that makes Mata brilliant. But before we get into Willians abilities, let's look at Juan. He's a number 10, (clearly, which is why he wears it). But we actually have 3 other players that can operate through the middle. Hazard (who actually prefers it); Oscar who has shown he's more than capable, although may be better suited deeper in the MF; and KDB who began showing his capabilities through the middle last season at Werder Bremen. All 3 can play the CAM role, and ultimately I think Jose may envision this to be Hazards future in the team, with Oscar and KDB as suitable backup. 

Last season, while they would interchange through out the game, Mata mostly occupied the CAM position which pushed Hazard out wide. If we allowed Mata to leave, this would permanently bring Hazard into the middle, which would open up a space on the LW for Willian. This spot could also be filled by KDB and/or Schurrle, but reports indicate that Jose highly rates Willian and if nothing else, gives Jose options out wide. 

My last point is just from a pure speculative point of view. I worry that Mata just isn't the type of player Jose prefers. We all know he's supremely gifted on the ball, with impeccable vision, and can place a ball on anyone's foot from almost anywhere on the pitch. But he lacks strength, pace, can't beat many players off the dribble and can be overrun against tough opposition (ie Yaya Toure). I think this is why Jose seems to love Hazard. Hazard is much stronger in all the areas Mata is not. Hazard has plenty of pace, incredible dribbing skills, is very strong on the ball despite his size, can beat anyone off the dribble, is very creative, and can actually contribute on the defensive side of the ball. All reasons why he may prefer Hazard to occupy the #10 spot instead of Super Juanito. 

Again, I adore Mata. He's my absolute favorite player and I would love nothing more than to see him retire in Blue. I just fear Jose might have a different view on Mata, and in turn could use him as a cog to obtain Rooney, which would address our striker issues. An issue that is far more pressing than the myriad of attacking MF's we currently have.

true,therespoutineinmyear,null,null,"Here's my (long-winded) take on things. I think a lot of people need to realize that FSG didn't get their valuation off of Transfermarket or FIFA or from measuring Willian's worth in units of Brett Favres, they got it from their football advisors/transfer committee. Brendan obviously disagrees with the valuation and, being the man who trains the players and devises our footballing strategy, he would know exactly Willian's value to this club as a footballer. However, FSG know his exact value as a financial asset regardless of what all the faux-economists who come out of the woodwork during the transfer window say. The supporters will almost always side with a manager demanding more money for players because most supporters are only concerned with what they see on the pitch and in the table so long as the club isn't stumbling into administration. My understanding of our current system is: FSG and Brendan want to win -&gt; FSG want value for money and Brendan wants quality players to strengthen the squad, but the football market is nonsensical so they obviously need a go-between -&gt; the committee/advisors determine the approximate financial value of targets with high footballing value -&gt; Ayre et al negotiate and if the price + any given wiggle room is exceeded, FSG are no longer getting value and pull the plug -&gt; Brendan gets pissed. [Correct me if I'm wrong]

My initial reaction was to side with Brendan and start to slip into the state of despair that many people in this sub have been languishing in for days now. However, I'm currently thinking that Brendan should have chosen his words a little more carefully. I cannot possibly fathom how this quarrel is as simple as FSG v. BR as most people like to pretend. A price was put on the player by footballing people who understand ""the current market"" and ""football culture"", Anzhi and Spurs pushed it past where the footballing people drew the line and FSG closed up the chequebook. I think a lot of this sub is in agreement that they were asking too much for what we'd get in return anyway.

However, Brendan and the angrier fans are reacting to the footballing value lost. Neither he nor us have any stake in the money side of things so he/we just had a ""perfect"" player slip through his/our fingers and he/we are a little bit pissed. FSG, however, just avoided a silly investment. The failure here lies either with the ""translators"" who communicate money to BR and football to FSG or with Brendan for failing to keep his disappointment in house. I don't believe the John Henry and his baseball-loving cronies who don't understand the ""current market"" or ""football culture"" decided that a certain number was too much, despite what many would have you believe (though I'm open to information to the contrary).

Also, I don't know if it's happened yet in this thread but if anyone compares us to Arsenal, my head will explode. Wenger was given a pile of cash and allowed to determine the monetary value of players himself, which is their problem. He could spend all 70m on Benzema or buy 140 Sanogos. The money was there to spend, he seemingly blew it with his poor valuations of players/unwillingness to act. We've gauge our money per transaction and it's been put on the table. Anzhi/Shakhtar/Atletico or the players wanted more than our valuation of them. Our failure to sign big names seems to be systemic while this drama I have to put on Brendan, much as I like him and understand his frustration.",0,1377215674,null,0,false,0,cbtdn5l,t3_1kwksr,t1_cbtdn5l,t3_1kwksr,null,1429733457,26,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,26

At the end of the day it's all about what the manager thinks we need. This isn't about our opinions on whether we think he's worth it or not, the issue here is that Rodgers identified a player he wanted, even going as far to describe him as perfect, but the owners refused to budge past their valuation of the player to support the manager, a manager that they identified and are supposed to put their full backing behind. Spurs have overspent on quality players and I don't see anyone complaining, they are showing much more ambition than we are and if anything people are fearing them this season. We clearly have the money, but the owners don't seem to have the will to go the extra yard as we saw with Dempsey and now with Willian.

John Henry posted an open letter recognising our shortcomings after last years transfer window, but the same mistakes are appearing again now. Rodgers has been on about getting quality for the first team for two months now, its a week before the deadline and there's nothing to show for it.

This isn't about wanting the owners to throw massive amounts of money at players, it's showing their backing of the manager when he identifies a player that he feels can improve the first team, but clearly they think they know better than him. The lack of significant investment and backing of Rodgers could seriously bite us in the ass this season as other teams around have added proven quality to their squads.

I don't disagree with you that if the manager really wants a target and it is at all feasible, then it should be heavily considered.  Without knowing all of the details, it's very difficult to be overly flustered about though as there are a multitude of things that could have happened.  By some account, Kia wanted £5M on top of the additional three wanted by Anzhi.  Include VAT, signing bonuses and such and now you're looking more at an additional £10M which is a lot.

Basically I think we just need to start making a damn profit on sales, that would help tremendously.  Cack like this has to stop:

* £16M for Babel, sold for £6M
* Adam for £7.4M, sold for £5.4M

While I didn't need physics for university, I hated Chemistry and so dropped it after AS-level; for upper sixth I did the 3 remaining subjects at A2-level and arranged with the school to do a Physics AS, for which they timetabled me in to sit in the lower sixth's classes. You'd need to check with your school if they could arrange this for you, but one possibility from there might be taking a gap year to do the A2, which I think a friend of a friend was planning to do. Again, you'd need to talk to your school to see what options are available and how they'd recommend going about it.

Lastly, if you haven't yet made any firm choice on where you want to study, a search will find you places that don't require Physics, such as [UCL](http://www.ee.ucl.ac.uk/undergraduate/entry), [Bristol](http://www.bris.ac.uk/prospectus/undergraduate/2014/sections/EENG/144/admissions), [Leeds](http://www.engineering.leeds.ac.uk/electronic/undergraduate/degree-electronic-engineering/index.shtml#tab705-4), [Manchester](http://www.eee.manchester.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/course/?code=08584&amp;pg=3) and [Sheffield](http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/eee/admissions/entry), though as you've found out the pool is a bit smaller.

No, I'm discussing ""the least you can pay and still have decent clothes and footwear"". Which is significantly less than you're implying. Like I've said to you several times already, I spend under £300 a year on clothes and shoes (probably under £200) and I have enough in my wardrobe I could wear a new outfit every day for a fortnight. I am telling you, from personal experience and from the actual data, that you are an entitled shit if you think anything under £300 a year is poverty.

&gt;yes?

You can't live half and half. You have one place of residence, and you visit the other. If one of her children chose to have her home as a place of residence and the other chose to live with their father on paper, then she would have a bill half the size. Which would be just as easy for her to pay, because she gets more than enough money to pay the original amount.

true,Pikul,lfc87,null,"&gt; they're about to get 85+ million pounds for Bale. That's why they're willing to overpay.

True, but that doesn't mean we don't have money. What about the sponsorship deal? The dead weight being moved on? Wages being slashed? Increases in ticket prices? There should be a decent amount of money available (not saying close to 85 million or anything!)

The money should be there for Rodgers to spend on at least one quality player, it's not going to break the bank if FSG allowed Rodgers the few extra million to get what he wanted. The Commolli/Dalglish experience still can't be used as an excuse.

This isn't so much about opinions on the player Willian is, it's about Rodgers and the scouts identifying a player that he wanted and the owners refusing to back him up on it, most likely under the instruction of their committee, a committee made up of ""footballing people""(most likely suits) of whom we don't know the identities. The same committee that wouldn't budge on an extra 2-3m for Dempsey yet seemingly suggested that Henderson be part of the deal instead. Of course Willian could have turned out to be a failure and that would have been on Rodgers head, but John Henry has stated that he trusts Rodgers judgement but it's clearly not the case here, he trusts his committee more. 

Rafa got political with the last owners about not being allowed to spend, I hope it doesn't turn into the same with Rodgers, not saying that FSG will turn in to Hicks and Gillette all of a sudden (I seriously doubt it) but some tensions could start to arise.

&gt;we were missing a finish

In fairness, we had 11 shots on target and their keeper was on fire plus we still have Suarez to return (maybe) and Sturridge to get his sharpness back.

I think it's because he recognizes this is a very good team that only needs one or two more quality players to really compete for a top place. They played great against Stoke, we were unlucky not to get a bigger result, and the players just seem to get the system and enjoy playing together. 

With it looking like Suarez will probably stay and make the group that much better upon his return, he should pissed about not getting a player who he rates (which is all that really matters) because the club refuses to meet a valuation. I don't know about you all, but I originally thought Willian had chosen Spurs himself, not that FSG weren't prepared to fork over what was necessary to get him. 

This is an owner whose baseball team (even after a massive salary dump last year) has one of the highest payrolls in Major League Baseball, and who just purchased a major American daily newspaper for 70 million dollars in cash. Henry may feel burned by Comolli splashing tons of his money on absolutely unworthy talent, but the fact is the new setup at the club has done things differently (and successfully so far) and he needs to back them financially. City, Chelsea and Spurs are spending because they need to in order to reach their goals (title, title, top four) and Liverpool are not. We're a quality attacking player and solid center back away from making a serious top four challenge; knowing that, I don't know why FSG thinks its acceptable to be running a net spend in a transfer window.

My hope is that the club has a plan, that either the Sakho rumours pan out or we get someone of value to add to the back, and that Henry, Werner and Ayre are just waiting for the right player on the attacking end who they see as worth the investment. I'm really looking forward to watching this team this season, and I think a top four place is well within reach with another quality attacking player.

If Suarez stays, we're looking at a top forward line at this point. I know there's been more ""news"" today, but honestly, I think he'll stay. If he goes to Madrid in some ridiculous turn of events, we'll get a ton of cash and maybe get them to throw in Morata or something. Who knows.

What I really hope, deep down in my heart, is that Rodgers looks at Chelsea signing Willian, says fuck it and gives Jose a call about Juan Mata, goes to the owners and says ""Look, we have the chance to get a world-class Spanish attacking midfielder, currently in the very midst of his prime, who can play three positions and yet is currently out of favor and expendable to his team.

Soldado is a decent, traditional number 9, but I don't personally like strikers that play like that as they just offer little other than scoring so just seem one dimensional.

true,nikcub,lfc68,null,"&gt; why else would they buy a club who was admittedly on the brink of administration?

Because they got it for a super-deflated valuation and the moment they signed the deal they made at least £100M

Buying clubs in administration is *better* than buying clubs not in administration. 

This also ignores one very pertinant fact. When fans complained about there being an american style transfer budget two seasons ago, and then when it blew up in our face last year, Henry came out and said that it doesn't matter - that *for the right player the funds are available*

What Rodgers is saying is that you can't get much more of a *right player* than Willian, and the funds were not available.

This is a massive fracture in the facade at LFC and this cannot be downplayed. We can't pretend that the 'valuation' FSG sets on transfer targets is determined by scouting when it is obviously being determined by a transfer budget. 

&gt; but it takes time to rebuild 

not according to Juventus, it doesn't. Lots of parallels there with LFC, except they got it much worse - they were relegated. Built a new stadium, signed top quality world class players without champions league and created a team that won the Serie A only 2 seasons later. 

There are lots of other case studies that can be cited. There are also many case studies of formerly great clubs cruising through mediocrity trying to grow organically.

&gt;  ""FSG is in it for the money"" bull shit.

FSG *are* in it for the money. They are a real fund with real investors who expect a return. And that isn't a bad thing - the better their return, the higher value Liverpool has and the likelihood of us returning to a period of success are. Financial strength and on field strength often correlate. 

&gt; being cautious, because that's what smart businesspeople do.

smart business people can analyze risk. being cautious or being optimistic means you are locked in one way or another and aren't analyzing the situation. the best and most famous business people are risk takers, but measured risk takers, with an ability to back themselves.

I can't think of a single successful businessperson who if I were to name 3 main attributes would one of them be 'cautious'.

The £46m was to cover our operating losses. £65m of that was stadium writedowns. Another £10m of that was management and coaching contracts being terminated. 

If you remove all the writedowns and impairments and simply looked at their spending on football based on revenue since FSG took over they have underspent. 

They paid £260m for the club, that is an absolute steal. The club today would be worth, conservatively, £500m (consider United is worth £3b). It is likely £600-700m. So while underspending the ownership group has realized a gain of over £300m.

My argument has always been that because they bought the club for so cheap, they

a) should not have been allowed to convert the £50m guarantee into a bank loan

b) should have upped that £50m to £150m so we can invest properly and get the club back into the top 4 (it would pay itself back at least three-fold - Liverpool with revenue back in the top 4 would be worth *a lot*).

We aren't going to get back there organically. The only way it can happen organically is if we flip some players and earn £100m+ that way, but that rarely happens (sell Suarez for £50m and do the same two more times). 

Spurs made around £90m from Bale yet the owners are still investing another £50m on top of that. They know that even the 90m isn't enough. This is what we are competing with - a club with £140m+ to invest.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"Not a huge surprise, but interesting.  I've raised this as a gender issue before - the fact that men and women use drugs in about equal measure, but that the male arrest, conviction and imprisonment rates for drugs are far higher, and as with this case, the differences are partly about stop and search.  

It's clear here that it's not just stop rates though, it's also wrapped up with exercise of police discretion to decide whether to take further action.  We have no data that I can see from the article as to whether the quantities and exact nature of the drugs seized are the same in arrest/non arrest scenarios (I'll look at the study and report back), but it's possible that the black people in this study are being stopped with greater quantities of drugs on average, or crack as opposed to powder cocaine, hash rather than weed etc. The last two shouldn't make any difference really since it's the same drug and the same law, but in exercising discretion, perception will play a role.  Anyway I'll check the study and edit this post if necessary.

Edit:  Okay, skim read [the report/study](http://www.release.org.uk/sites/release.org.uk/files/pdf/publications/Release%20-%20Race%20Disparity%20Report%202013_0.pdf) and there doesn't appear to be any analysis related to quantities seized in stop and searches or the precise nature of the drugs seized, so I suspect both will be factors.  That's unfortunate as it means it's impossible to exclude them as confounding variables, even though it might look pretty obvious that this is about institutional and possibly personal racism.  Another example of the politics of policing if it is, and clearly highlighting one reason for the amount of tension police relations can generate in poor, urban and ethnically diverse areas.

On a side issue.  One of the interesting points in the report is an anecdote from a police officer about patrolling with a more experienced officer and immediately going out to the likely places to hit the usual suspects for stop and searches to get a possession charge, the argument being that it's best to get this out of the way early so they can concentrate on proper policing for the rest of the shift.  That is a powerful illustration of how performance targets can provide perverse incentives.",0,1377225175,null,0,1377226813,0,cbtgzi9,t3_1kwdnf,t1_cbtgzi9,t3_1kwdnf,null,1429731825,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"Right, so here is the run down as best deciphered at the moment:

**Bale** -  Yesterday most people felt it was done and dusted. NBC even jumped the gun and in an effort to establish their credentials as a sports network reported it as being done. Marca reported it is done for what has to be the 12th time this summer. Real Madrid have started making preparations to sell Bale jerseys.  Most people still believe it is done however there are 2 different versions of stories making the rounds of the various boards  1) its fully agreed but Levy won't sign until the Lamela/Willian deals are final (this will be important later) 2)We are willing to make the deal, Real want to make the deal but Levy wants the price we quoted (£100m) and Flo wants to pay the price he wants to pay (£85m) and the two are still haggling. Either way the deal  may or may not be finalized anywhere from tomorrow to tuesday depending on who is reporting it.

**Lamela** - Seems to be a done deal. There was a Roma day or meet Roma players or open practice yesterday that Lamela took part in. During the event Lamela was apparently highlighted by the team and his girlfriend tweeted ""What a farce"" in regards to all of it. One of the club directors made a statement to one of the Italian papers saying that he knew for a fact that Lamela ""Will not play for Rome this year"" and ""he will play in the premiere league with Tottenham"". Later that evening Erik's brother said on twitter that Erik was going to Tottenham.  Today was radio silence, reports that Erik may or may not be in London tomorrow.

**Willian** - Ah, the fun one....So, we know Willian has taken and passed his medical with Spurs, we know that it seemed all set to be completed today. Then, this morning reports that the deal ""was close but Willian is considering his options"" virtually everyone maintained that the deal would be completed. Then the fun began. From what has been pieced together...as Willian was literally pulling into the grounds in Enfield we received a phone call from Anzhi. There is another offer on the table...from Chelsea and it appears to be for more money.  This of course resulted in furious Spurs fans, surprisingly a huge number of furious Chelsea fans and a gleeful number of LFC and Arsenal fans.

So...evidently the offer from Chelsea appears to be real. Jason Burt (AVB's bestie in the media) [tweeted this statement] (https://twitter.com/JBurtTelegraph/status/370618965552144384) where he asked the question virtually all Spurs and Chelsea fans wanted to know...where would Chelsea actually use Willian?  All of this is occurring with Willian and his agent standing in the Spurs facilities.

Now we are hearing whispers that Willian may be the replacement for Mata...with Mata being sent to Man United in exchange for Rooney. This of course is speculation as no one seems to know what the hell is going on except that...

All of this chaos is apparently the result of Willian's agent, word is he asked for a truck load of cash and we wouldn't budge on wages so he went and whored Willian out to anyone who would listen.  Evidently Chelsea listened.

You have all that?....good, because there are other pieces floating on the edges of all this.

There are now reports that Real are preparing to make a bid for Suarez, which of course has at least 2 theories surrounding it...1)The Bale deal is stalled and Real are making the move for Suarez because they can't get Bale (because we can't get Willian, i told you to remember that earlier)...or...2) Real are buying Suarez because he is an upgrade to Benzema and the deal is being done independently of the Bale deal.  Benzema then potentially would be sold to Arsenal.

In truth....we have no clue what is going on.  If you read the ITKs several of them are saying that Willian is still coming to Spurs, others are saying he is going to Chelsea all of them state that Willian's agent is a massive twat. JJetset who is considered one of the better ITKs declined to even comment on the Willian fiasco but then commented that no changes had happend in the Bale negotiations and that Real hadn't met our number.  So even the ITKs don't have a clue what the hell is going on (not that they necessarily would but presumably if you are ITK you have more information that the rest of us.)

As for a CB...reports that Chirches is done except for the owner in jail to again sign off on the deal...presumably we are haggling over the number of cartons of cigarettes to include in the deal for him....unless of course we are bidding on someone else and that we may have made an inquiry for Sahko.

Oh yeah...and lest i forget the best story of the day.....we may be back in bidding for **LEANDRO FUCKING DAMIAO**

Arsenal has Champions League football to offer, and finished 12 points ahead of Liverpool. (Suarez bid)

Spurs finished 11 points ahead of Liverpool and has Europa Cup. (reported Willian bid)

Dortmund has Champions League. First runners-up in CL and Bundesliga last season. (Mkhitaryan bid) 

Atletico Madrid finished 3rd in La Liga and are in Champions League. (Costa bid). 

It is increasingly likely that players in the first team of a club in Europe are not going to join a club that is not in Europe. It is also increasingly likely (not that this is anything new) that when the choice is between a club with Europe and a club without, players will choose Europe. 

Spurs managed 4th and 5th place finishes in the last 4 years with van der Vaart the only ""world-class"" purchase made. Not only must Liverpool improve their squad to a competitive level, Rodgers must also prove that he is capable of competing. His purchases before this season are a little hit-and-miss. While Sturridge and Coutinho were great steals, the jury is still out on Joe Allen, and Borini has been injured too often to justify his transfer. 

Without the oil-rich resources of Man City or personal bankroll of Abramovic at Chelsea, Rodgers must prove that he is capable of creating talent, not just buy the hottest product on the market. Almost all the best managers are known for this. Ferguson created almost an entire team of youngsters that became some of the best players even seen in British football. Moyes kept pace with Liverpool and even leapfrogged the club despite have a lot less to spend. Not only is Wenger good at promoting young players, his team of Invincibles were in no way a list of marquee signings. Mourinho won the Champions League with a squad that was a lot worse than the clubs he was competing with. Klopp has time and again lost his best players and replaced them with virtual unknowns from Eastern Europe who eventually became superstars. 

Before the fans turn on the owners for keeping the purse-strings tight, I think they should first consider whether Rodgers should be trusted with full-rein of the checkbook.

I'd like to *think* that Moffat is well aware of the canon and many of the most interesting fan theories out there (such as the Doctor being an Old One or The Other and thus truly immortal, or visiting Rassilon's tomb to steal true Immortality). He'd be a poor writer if he passed up an opportunity like this to do something interesting with the Doctor's last 'natural' regeneration.

I'm partial to the idea that The Doctor is actually a reincarnation of The Other. That would mean he has unlimited regenerative capacity.

1. Rassilon (the supreme time lord) has the secret of True Immortality (unlimited regenerations). This is locked in his tomb (on Gallifrey). At least three other Time Lords are rumored to have successfully navigated the dangers and stolen this secret.

2. If The Doctor is indeed 'The Other' (Rassilon's once right-hand man and the cleverest time lord who ever lived, also a true immortal) then his Thirteenth regeneration will be a reincarnation of The Other. This is goes into how The Other chose to end his life - by merging with The Looms. There are a lot of interesting prophecies about The Other including his future incarnation saving Gallifrey from total destruction. This one seems like it has the most potential to me, as it would lead to The Doctor saving Gallifrey somehow from the sad state it is in, locked in the latest time war with the daleks.

3. There are various ways of 'recharging' a time lord's regenerative capacity. All of these are locked up on Gallifrey in one form or another.

4. There was a race of Time Lords from a prior universe that crossed over the big bang. These beings are also immortal. Some of these beings have met The Doctor and generally recognize him as being one of their own kind. Their memories of the prior universe are lost.

Your number of £46M on the loan from UKSV would only cover Oct 2010 to May 2012, I believe.

At some point, the losses have to stop.  Ideally our recurring expenses would be at maybe 85-90% of our turnover, not at 100%+.  The good news is May 2012-2013 we should see an increase of ~£30M on the commercial side (thankfully, otherwise the losses would have been massive and put us afoul of the FFP -£35M no-no mark) and for May 2013-2014 if nothing else we should see something like +£25M from TV rights which should get us pretty close to break even even if the wage bill and amortization of player registrations remained equal to the previous year (which they won't).

might need to clarify this point. everything is worthy of its own thread if a thread for that topic doesn't exist yet. 

the problem we were referring to was when somebody would start a separate thread for content that could be a comment on an existing thread. 

eg. say somebody wants to respond to these Rodgers quotes - the place for that is in the comment thread here, not as a new thread. (eg. ""Relax about what Rodgers said guyyzz!!!"" as a new thread).

A good way to aggregate comments is the catch-all ""You'll never wonder alone"" transfer and rumor threads. If there hasn't been one in 24+ hours and anybody feels there is enough to talk about then feel free to fire them up.

To get those threads highlited you just need to include the words ""wonder alone"" somewhere in the title.
