true,thatstevelord,cnty-england,AmazingBlazingBasingstoke,"It's an IPSEC L2TP VPN into the ec2 node which then bridges to Tor for several reasons.

If you run a straight open access VPN on Amazon EC2 it'll probably be abused pretty quickly and taken down. Routing through Tor masks the ec2 node and if the browser/device is appropriately configured it'll be masked too.

Another thing is that by providing access to Tor it's a really easy way to provide access to hidden services. You have to assume that public nodes are compromised (it would be easy for a government to set up fake public nodes that listen to everything between the vpn and tor bridge), but private nodes are reasonably safe (for some values of reasonably). 

Being able to access Tor hidden services at the TCP/IP level opens up some interesting things. For example, you can run a webdav over Tor from inside your home network without piercing holes in your firewall, let your family connect over lahana and have access to it through Tor. You could run a Jabber IM server on Tor and connect to it from your iPhone via Lahana. I've currently been experimenting with mumble to see whether or not Lahana could be extended to provide encrypted voice chat, but I'm concerned about the changes to the threat model that might cause more problems than it solves.",0,1374797904,null,0,false,0,cbadxz7,t3_1j1uqu,t1_cbadxz7,t1_cbab4n4,null,1430334370,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

There was another case where a man called for an ambulance at 2AM, and it still hadn't arrived by 10AM. 

Also, on a couple of Saturdays, there have been as little as 7 people manning the phones for the entire Midlands area.

We've been given an absolute treat over the past four years in Matt Smith, and I feel he's been the most poorly utilized actor so far to play the Good Doctor in the New Who.

The fan theories on Reddit tend to show better grasp of arching plots and sweeping storylines.  I can read them and be more challenged.

If you listen to people's complaints about doctors it is always about how hard it is to get an appointment, how they are always running late and so on. The reason for this is that a massive amount of GP time is taken up by people that unnecessarily attend weekly or ask for appointments to get them to sign some legal document for benefits or the such. The British public has lived for so long with a free healthcare system that they've forgotten the value of it. The result is that they waste its resources and then complain when they don't get a service which meets their unrealistic expectations.

Almost all doctors are passionately proud about the NHS, almost as passionate as they are about wanting to help their patients. The NHS is dying a death of a thousand cuts, but it is at the hands of the government and not the doctors. It's really disappointing that people are completely oblivious to just how biased our press is. A silly headline like this gets heated discussion, but nobody seems to want to talk about the growing portion of the NHS that is being sold to private agents like Richard Branson. Why? Because the press are being suspiciously quiet about all that stuff, and with no journalists announcing it/telling people what their opinion should be, there's no awareness.

Ironically, the only group of people that are trying to make any noise about dismantling and selling off of our beloved health service are the medical community that everyone is slagging off for being greedy and not caring.

The British public has become terribly bitter and nasty towards the professions recently, especially since the recession. ",0,1374801048,null,0,false,0,cbaeziu,t3_1j1s0e,t1_cbaeziu,t3_1j1s0e,null,1430333878,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Still, on balance they're worth it, and if you look at survival rates from particular cancers where early detection happens, it seems like a good idea (although, it's worth noting cancer survival generally means being alive five years after detection, so if you detect it earlier, your survival rates will be better even if the treatment is totally ineffective!)",0,1374801173,null,0,false,0,cbaf0y2,t3_1j1s0e,t1_cbaf0y2,t1_cbabfzj,null,1430333859,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"&gt; I'm very confused by Suarez's motivation in pushing for this (if he is) as it strikes me as a largely lateral move. Arsenal doesn't seem that far ahead of Liverpool considering all the money we’ve been spending bringing in players, and how our play has evolved recently.

I think we're building quite a strong team and one that will continue to progress forward and hopefully grow into a great team.

However, maybe the fact is that Luis Suarez simply doesn't want to wait and grow with the team. Perhaps he simply doesn't see the same promise and growth as the rest of us do. Perhaps he sees Liverpool's entry into the Champions League still a season or two off, and the chances of *winning* the Champions League even further down the road.

Perhaps he simply wants to play in the Champions League *RIGHT NOW* no matter the cost. Arsenal has shown the interest and Suarez wants to go.

Obviously this is all speculation but hopefully he realizes that Liverpool FC can reach the Champions League more quickly with him, attract better players with CL and Suarez, and move towards winning the CL with him.

Wow! No wonder all of these episodes cost so much! That's like $5k a day! 

You are a bullshitter. I called you out on it and I was right. You have no goddamn idea what you're talking about, you just wanted to sound self important to raise your own self worth. 

People aren't stupid. Have some respect and stop lying to them. 

And, as far as the original comment which you replied to goes, they WOULD cost more to reproduce, because not only are the ones in the show cheap enough to replace on a daily basis, but these ones are plated with actual gold and silver and are sold for individual profit, entirely unlike the ones in the show. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised that if you were to consider this persons wage, since he doesn't get paid for each individual thing he does, that in the end he's likely barely compensated for all of his work, compared to how much work he puts in anyways. 

If these replicas cost less than the ones in the show (which have to be remade so often) then the producers of the show are getting ripped off big time, apparently. Because, at that point, why not just go with whoever is making these replicas, since they can apparently do it cheaper while being in plated gold/silver. 

Television IS expensive to produce, but it's not outrageously and pointlessly expensive. They don't shell out as much money as possible for every little detail. They do the exact opposite so long as it achieves what they want. Look at Big Fish. That entire town is literally fake, it just looks real. That's television. They do everything as cheaply as possible, because when you add everything up it's very costly. These screwdrivers cost the show nowhere near what the limited run was sold for. They were probably about as expensive as these super fancy ones are, maybe a bit more when you take every last little thing into account. But the price for the repo's is SUBSTANTIALLY inflated.

They've shown a willingness to learn on the job and that shows from transitioning from simply throwing money at players (Dalglish window where we bought downing and hendo) to a more collective and thought out process in our current transfer committee. While hindsight is 50/50 Torres was a striker already on the downward trend and the circumstances were different (submitting a request near the end of the window whereas we've had all summer to deal with Suarez). Now I'm not going to speculate that Suarez will definitely stay because that just sets me up for disappointment but what I can say with confidence is that whichever decision the owners and Brendan come up with will be in the best interest of the club and its ambitions even if that requires Suarez leaving (except to a rival largely),0,1374810176,null,0,false,0,cbai0el,t3_1j12t2,t1_cbai0el,t1_cba71z9,null,1430332380,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

People hold out for monetary rewards all the time. In a normal job, someone might decide to stay till January just so that they can collect on the year-end bonus. Or wait for whatever performance bonus they collect (either in April or July) before leaving. This is very very common. 

You all should realise that unlike normal people, footballers are generally not allowed to seek other employment while under contract. There are things such as tapping-up rules that forbid representatives from another team talking to the player without the player's club's permission. 

Suarez doesn't have to send in a transfer request. He can entice other clubs to bid for him knowing full-well that he has a clause which will allow the club to let him negotiate even if the bid was refused. This way, he can do the equivalent of normal people taking leave from their job to go for an interview with another company. This way, he can see for himself whether it is a good deal to move. He is shopping for options, something every person in a normal job does. It doesn't show that he **desperately** wants to leave, but it does show that he is very very willing to leave.

true,WhirldTravlr,null,null,"Like a lot of other people who've posted here, I'm an American, but was lucky enough to get my degree in England at the University of Reading. This story starts way back in 2000, and it was already my third year abroad. 

How had I already been abroad for 3 years and not fallen in love with the beautiful game yet, you ask?? Good question. 

I'm not sure how how I came to meet my friend Dave, but I'll blame the late Wednesday and Saturday nights at the Student Union. After a while Sunday morning breakfasts at the local Scream bar became the tradition, and especially if there was a Liverpool game on. 

Dave is a passionate Liverpool fan, and the best kind of Liverpool fan there is. He grew up in a split household, mom loved Liverpool, and dad loved ManU (thank god he ended up on the right side!). And it wouldn't matter if there wasn't another soul in the bar, he would be there watching the Reds play. So spending Sunday mornings with Dave, this was my incubator, this is where I began to love Liverpool FC.

2000-01 was one of the most amazing seasons to follow Liverpool, and there can't be many comparisons which can be made in modern sports history (but would love to hear them!). I got to watch Liverpool win the League Cup, but even at that point I probably didn't understand what I was seeing. Then, I got to see Michael Owen embarrass an Arsenal defense and, and along with a legendary team lift the FA Cup wearing yellow and black in Cardiff. And finally, in my very own Reading Students Union, pulled my heart back out of my stomach after an unbelievable Uefa Cup Final against Alaves. 

I can't say that it was the greatest moment I've ever had being a Liverpool fan. In 2005 I was at a half-empty Irish bar in Turks &amp; Caicos, surrounded by friends in red, friends I had never met before. We all drank and sang even though we were losing 3-0. And we all witnessed what would go down as the most incredible turn around in football history. And to this day I will disappoint girlfriends and future wives by telling them that THAT was the best day of my life.

But at the end of the day, it wasn't that crazy night in Istanbul, or the Danny Murphy free kicks, or watching Mourinho lose it when we beat them over two legs.  It was a couple Sunday morning breakfasts, the passion of my friend, and the magic of that 00-01 season that changed everything for me.

true,HungryBook,cnty-uk,Insaniquarium,"He used the situation to his advantage.  Some MPs are worried about Unite's influence - for that, read 'we're worried that ordinary working people, not career politicians, are getting involved in shaping politics'.  I think I felt a bit angry at first - I was upset that Unite members might have been doing stupid things - but then I was confused at why it had gone to the police; surely it would be internal for Unite and Labour to sort out.  Now that we know there's no criminal case to be answered, and that Unite had done nothing wrong, and that Labour haven't apologised, I'm just plain angry.  Basically, they didn't get their way so they told stories to the police.  In my mind, that's not only childish, it's a waste of police time.

Unite's influence is nothing sinister - and it's nothing huge since, as you can see, usually our requests are ignored by the party; but since the trade unions founded and fund Labour, it's in our interest that the party listens to our members.  Members of Unite can get the chance to shape politics, since politics affect their working life; policies such as taxation, transport, pensions, health - all of these are things that our members work in and contribute towards, so why shouldn't they have a say?

Me, I'm wondering what big company the party has lined up to fill the funding gap - they must have *someone* ready, otherwise they wouldn't have done it.  Sadly, the request to my local constituency group hasn't gone anywhere yet (I'm a labour party member too) so I'm a bit disgruntled about this as well.  If I stay in, I'll get frustrated, if I quit I can't effect any change!

true,Wildcard35,num22-away,,"From what I can gather they usually ease players back into playing first team football. Obviously you've got to recover from the initial injury, undergo physical therapy for however long, and then you start getting back into training.

Training might be a solo workout designed with your needs in mind. Training might involve working with your fellow players. No matter the route, the goal is to get them back playing. Once they are deemed fit to play again, then another particular path is set out.

When Scott Parker was coming back off of injury he played with our U-21 squad (despite being old enough to have fathered them all after his time in WW2). This was because he physically was not ready to handle the pressure of a PL, but he was ready to handle some kick-about with the kiddos (no disrespect to them, our youth talent is glorious).

After this is obviously another step up: coming back into the first team. Once you prove you can play at the first team level you're eased back into training, back into the squad, and back onto the glistening green fields of the Lane.

I realize I've danced around your question here, but honestly you answered it yourself. It can go either way, but Sandro has most likely been put into a very well-regimented training program to get him back to 100%. He will come back into the first team fold, and he will be unleashed upon our enemies. Anything could happen, but rest-assured. The Beast will be back, once he has the Tottenham Hotspur Med Staff, and the Bizzler's blessing. (shout-out to you Mr. Touche ;) )

He would obviously want to jump straight into a top side but that is looking increasingly unlikely to happen.

Looks like they will use Arsenal as a stepping stone and try to move again at 28.

I would love to do what daniel levy did with modric when chelski were after him.

Let him sulk until the end of the transfer window. Tell chelski to fuck off nomatter what they bid. Keep him for the season and sell him to real madrid the next summer. 

Daniel Levy at spurs knows how to play hardball in the transfer market,  its the only reason they even have a chance of keeping Bale.

Anyway, if suarez does go it will be a heavy blow but keep your heads up. If we can get some decent quality in with the money, we will still move forward as a team.

The study was flawed for the following reasons:

* This study had no control group, 
* It was dealing with anecdotal of autism, 
* The authors had not disclosed that they had a financial gain from making people have separate vaccines rather than MMR, 
* The study caused the lead doctor to loose his medical licence because he performed test on children that were unethical and potentially dangerous just for the study which wouldn't benefit the child at all.

Can I have a source on compensation because I haven't found a single thing talking about it on the CDC website. The CDC has [this paper](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Concerns/Thimerosal/QA_Pediatrics-thimerosal-autism.html) which shows that Thimerosal (which is now not as widely used as a preservative in vaccines) does not cause Autism.

On the CDC [webpage on autism](http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/research.html#risk) The first line says the following
&gt;Many studies have looked at whether there is a relationship between vaccines and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). To date, the studies continue to show that vaccines are **not** associated with ASDs.

The emphasis on not is on the site and isn't mine.

Anyways, my brother told me of an English team with a strong Spanish link. I was always a fan of Fernando, so I supported Liverpool. We tore up the league in 2008 (unfortunately not enough) and I fell in love. As the Spanish link grew weaker, I knew that my loyalty was to Liverpool.

true,lordbiro,null,null,"I disagree. Run off voting makes more sense. Here's a thought experiment.

Let's say there is a constituency that has always voted for the Purple party. 60% of the town agrees that the Purple party reflect what they want. Let's also say that those 60% absolutely disagree with everything that the Cyan party have to say. In fact they would rather be able to vote ""Not Cyan"" if that was possible, that's how much they disagree with their policies.

One day the candidate who has always run for the Purple party stands as an independent candidate. His views are almost identical to the Purple party but he has decided he doesn't like the colour Purple any more.

It comes to election time, and a first past the post system is used. Around half of the Purple party voters continue to vote for the Purple party, and around half now vote for the independent candidate. 40% continue to vote for the Cyan party.

* The Purple party gets 29%
* The independent candidate gets 31%
* The Cyan party continues to get 40% and now wins.

The independent candidate loses, even though that 29% would rather see him get elected than the Cyan party. And even though 60% of constituents hate the Cyan party, they still get elected.

Let's imagine a run-off voting system was used instead.

In this case everyone that would put a ""1"" next to either the Purple party or the independent candidate would put a ""2"" next to the independent candidate or Purple party, respectively.

So the first round of counting would look like this:

* The Purple party gets 29%
* The independent candidate gets 31%
* The Cyan party gets 40%

The Purple party has definitely lost, so they are eliminated, and any ballots with a ""1"" for the Purple party are now re-counted using whatever the ballot has a ""2"" against:

* The independent candidate gets 60%
* The Cyan party gets 40%

So the independent, who was the first choice of 31% of voters and the second choice of 29% of voters, now wins. I think this is much fairer.

This is just one example, but practically every example I have seen of run-off voting scenarios seem fairer to me.",0,1374823562,null,0,false,0,cbalgxb,t3_1j0hj7,t1_cbalgxb,t1_cbad1dt,null,1430330751,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Wait what?

""Why are people not talking about issue 1 because I think issue 2 isn't important. Answer by not making this about issue 2, which you'd need to do to show me why it's important""

I can't answer your question without explaining why the filter is a *big fucking deal*. It doesn't make the issue you are worried about any less important or meaningful but largely the whole, you know, censoring of the internet via a government attempt at regulation has a wider range of impacts and problems. 

I also don't understand how you can say ""it seems like small fry compared to this 'moral policing'"" when you are talking about a system of defaults that will filter *much more* content than just *all* porn in an attempt to set default morals of a nation. The thing is that these two things are not separate issues, they are part of the same moral push, today it's filtering porn by default and making some ""extreme"" porn illegal... tomorrow, after demonizing all porn and telling us over and over ""think of the children"" it will be ""well, we should make *all* porn illegal, think of the children!"" now I know this is a slippery slope argument but all case of moral panic are an attempt to manufacture that slope.

Rodgers mentioned Cavani in passing once and now its widely accepted it's £50m?? It's laughable, I personally thing to sell to a domestic rival (which Cavani was not) we may be holding out for considerably more, perhaps £60m, who knows.

LFC are unlikely in contact with a replacement yet, they still consider themselves in a strong position over Suarez.

I cried after the first half in Istanbul  but continued watching, I cried when Torres left(still do sometimes), and I get scared thinking steve g might retire one day.  I love Liverpool even though I am so far from there, and there is nothing that keeps me from switching teams. I will love this team no matter what, wherever I am

The crap old shed of a station (on the Euston-to-Birmingham line) is being completely rebuilt, and the two University campuses are eventually going to be merged into a shiny new campus south of the city centre.

Its highstreet is slowly dying, being unable to face-off both Amazon and the proximity of the Milton Keynes shopping mall.

It used to be famous for shoe-making, and after that industry died, for lift research. It still maintains a lot of expertise in leather-tanning from the shoemaking days. There is an old tower on the edge of town (the Northampton Lighthouse, according to Wogan) which was once used for lift experiments. It's still very big in Automotive engineering with Silverstone in close proximity, and its (small) University boasts impressive employment figures for its graduates. The British Institute of Non-Destructive Testing has their HQ here, and a lot of distance-learning for the oil and gas industry is based here too.

It’s been made an enterprise zone, and is one of the few places in the country to be getting two new Engineering colleges (one to be at Silverstone, with a former McClaren director as its headmaster). There are lots of small-but-growing engineering companies in the area who specialise in motorsport and composite technologies.

The nightlife is the normal mix of old local pubs, real-ale houses, weatherspoon nightclubs full of townies, but there is one jewel I’ve discovered; the best rock night this side of the country. The Blast Chamber, on a Saturday. I’ve got friends who’ll travel from London, Birmingham or Leicester for a night out there.

He seems more in the out and out striker mold and this doesn't fit our style.  We may as well have kept Andy Carroll.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"Having worked in both the NHS and private buisnesses ranging from small companies to multinationals I can honestly say I've never encountered an organisation that runs off its staff like the NHS does. 

The entire culture of the NHS is *give give give* at a staff level. People should be aware of it because the flipside of it is, whenever any money does get pumped into the NHS it usually get sucked up by staff, who see it as just recompense for the sacrafices they put in... and they aren't wrong. But its a pretty shitty way of running a major service and its bad for the public in the long run as they don't see the benefits of large investments like they should. 

Just to give you a few examples of some of the 'day to day' grind issues that make working in the NHS a giving game.

* Many NHS staff cannot choose the dates for their annual leave - they get it allocated, and this includes bank holidays and weekends. It even covers christmas/new years etc... but its okay right because if you work christmas surely you get extra pay? - NO. pay rates are fixed in contracts so there are no bonuses for working extremely anti-social shifts like christmas/easter etc.

* Most hospitals charge staff pretty high rates for even basic things like parking permits.

* There aren't even usually small perks like complimentary coffee or a microwave in staffrooms - if there is coffee in there, it's because a staff member has bought it themselves for everyone.

* There is a trememdous amount of guilt/pressure put on staff to not call in sick and to take on too many hours. 

* One of the most heinous crimes you can commit in the NHS is to be seen to 'generate work' for other members of staff, such as by calling in sick, getting things wrong, not finishing all the things allocated to you during your work hours etc. So a lot of nurses and doctors end up staying on well beyond their scheduled finishing times - for which they don't get overtime.

Phil the 'props' guy? More than likely somebody who manages the props.

Nick Robatto is the one that makes them, as you can see on his [website](http://www.rubbertoereplicas.com/). He has been since series 3 or 4 I think though don't quote me on that.

Please listen to what Matt Smith is saying, A. He is exaggerating, if he broke as many as he said he did as badly as you assume and as often they would completely redesign them.

He says he breaks them. That doesn't mean he puts them through a trash compactor, that can mean anything from scratching it visibly to, well putting it through a trash compactor. They also don't have to COMPLETELY REDESIGN AND CREATE THE PROP EVERY TIME HE BREAKS ONE. THEY SIMPLY REPAIR IT. As I have said repeatedly, much of the cost of creating a television prop is the R &amp; D and licensing every single part of it (including every concept that flys across the table). Prop makers are NOT cheap.

Seriously, how thick are you? Yes. I am going to be blunt and bloody rude with you considering your post before you complain.

These. Aren't. Replicas. They are television remotes in a similar shape.

For starts the dimensions are wrong, as they had to adjust them to accommodate for the electronics. Then there's the whole fact that, as 'plated would suggest' the outer shell is completely made from plastic (I just checked on my own remote). I mean seriously, think about it. How cheap is it to produce a hollow plastic shell, now how cheap is it to source various durable metals, cnc them into the correct shape and then construct a working prop with electronics built around any mechanisms (opening)? 

Your answers, a fuck load more expensive. You keep god damn assuming that people who bought the replica paid $3999.95 for the replica itself. No they didn't, they paid probably about $500 for the replica and the rest on the huge amount of time that the prop maker has to spend building them and making them identical to the ones on the show (yes, that's every last single measurement exactly correct). 

They shell out a lot of money on props that will be recurring (TARDIS Interior, sonic.etc). Why do you think the BBC has a props and wardrobe warehouse? If props were as cheap to make as this... Hell, just create a brand new everything every episode! No. They have a warehouse to reduce costs as props can be re purposed for different things and it means that they don't have to pay for all the R&amp;D/Licensing all over again. 

They cost more than the limited run ones. As I keep saying and you keep ignoring there is more to the cost than material.

Plastic shells are a lot cheaper to make than a full new prop.

These are probably more durable than the prob as well, they're one piece. 

Costs of a prop:
- R&amp;D, designing the prop from the ground up

- Material, sourcing the material for the prop, often rare or 'exotic' materials for the 'alien' feel.

-Licensing. Making sure that the prop maker can't just sell off concept art for profit, or make Sonics on the side for his/her mates. 

- Construction: Making sure every detail on every prop is identical, or suits it's purpose. 

- Paying the prop maker: For all the above

The only parts that the QMX replicas had to bother about were 2, 4 and 5. Hence why they don't cost nearly as much as the original props. 

Now I've spelled everything out for you clearly in one post, does it make more sense dear? Or do I have to dumb it down further so it penetrates your thick skull?

Anyone can walk into a phone shop and buy a PAYG phone along as they have money in their pocket, so there are no implied age checks in place and a default-on filter makes sense since there is no age restriction on buying phones.  

For most ISPs you are going to require a bank account that handles Direct Debits or provides a VISA/MCard account, both of which are generally only available to people over the age of 18 who should be free to make their own decisions regarding what content is and is not accessible to them. 

&gt;I can access the web on my phone, Windows pc, Linux pc, and at least three games consoles and various other devices. This means a filter would have to be on my router.

That's pretty much wrong.  Filtering would be done at an ISP level - like that used by mobile companies, and ISPs to block access to TPB etc - rather than a device level.  You effectively hand off your ability to police access to content from your connection to whoever runs or manages the filter.  Want to search for a shop in Scunthorpe?  Tough luck, the keyword filter is outside of your control and there's no guarantee the ISP is going to add an exception just for you.  

A device level filter would be easily bypassed by buying a third party router, or flashing it with a 'clean' OS like DD-WRT etc.",0,1374832214,null,0,false,0,cbamr4g,t3_1j367b,t1_cbamr4g,t1_cbamn8w,null,1430330145,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

Parent's should be responsible for their children.  It's not the stat's place to enforce a blanket filter on everyone in name of 'won't somebody think of the children!' 

If ISPs provide filtering then it should be part of the sign-up process for customers to state if they have children and then if they want their access filtered to remove 'adult' material.  There should be no default state for the filter, it should be implicitly selected by the customer, with an easy option (not involving having to call Sarah in Customer Support to please turn the porn back on) to change it's state that's not buried forty levels deep on the ISPs help pages.  It should have multiple levels of filtering since whilst you may not want your toddler looking at boobs you may want to let you teenagers access sexual health material.  It should be transparent,  If a site is blocked I want to know why it's blocked and under what category.  It should provide me as a parent with the choice of logging and reporting on what my kids are trying to look at.  In other words things that help me as a parent, not hand my responsibilities to the state.


What we will probably end up with however is something that doesn't work properly, blocks legitimate sites, is bypassed by typing 'UK PORN FILTER PROXY' into google, requires copies of driving licences or passports to turn off and slows your access down to a crawl and is abused by companies reporting their competitors sites as infringing.

Cameron and his terrible internet filtering bullshit aside, what the hell is the deal with this line, BBC? It's controversial just because it's Chinese and successful? Could we please tone down the fear-mongering?

&gt;But Huawei's position was recently the subject of an Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) report. It criticised the lack of ministerial oversight over the firm's rapid expansion in the UK.

&gt;The committee said ""the **alleged** links between Huawei and the Chinese State are concerning, as they generate suspicion as to whether Huawei's intentions are strictly commercial or are more political"" - but added that it had **not found any evidence of wrongdoing.**

The ISC, the very same committee that oversees the Security Service, the SIS and our much loved GCHQ, the very same committee that looked over the Iraq Dossier that sent us to war in 2003, and found it to be misleadingly alarmist.

Even these guys, with access to all that privacy-ignoring data couldn't find any evidence at all to even make a concrete *link* between Huawei and the Chinese government, and found no evidence of any sort of suspicious behaviour.

China isn't a country of flowers and ponies, they have serious privacy issues. But that's not an excuse to assume that every Chinese company that becomes a player in the international field must be working as a spy or shill for their government. Can't they just be capitalists looking to make shit loads of money?

In any case, what are people afraid of China for?

You're afraid they'll look at your personal data? Exactly what the US and UK governments already do?

You're afraid they'll block stuff based on Chinese policies? As if they could do that without anyone noticing and replacing them.

Huawei is just a company looking to sell hardware and software, just like Cisco or any other telecoms firm.

Best case: You are required to disclose personal habits to someone who has no right to know what you get up to in your own time.

Worst case: Arguments with SO, or someone in a shared house might end up being filtered against their will, by default.

Either way you look at it, its a massive imposition by the state into a persons private life, across the board, with no real logic behind it other than ""The mail says its for the kids"".

Would you support a ban on alcohol except for those people who opt in to a register of alcohol purchasers held by the NHS? No, of course not. So why support this measure over educating parents on how to safeguard their children?

Keeping children safe online will only ever be achieved by education, good parenting and awareness, not by treating everyone as a child and moving the state into a parental role.

true,HarryBlessKnapp,null,Petes not so secret gay lover,"His best work is scattered about, since he's got so much stuff. ""Nightbus dubplate"" is possibly my favourite track of all time. It's a battle track, so if you're not au fait with the history there's a lot of content in there that you won't get at first, and even now I still hear new things in that track. But lyrically it's just insane. His flow is incredible. The way he rides the beat is nothing short of perfect. So even to the untrained ear you should still be able to appreciate that. The thing about grime as opposed to hip hop is that it's hype music. Grime mc's are not so focused on story telling and content all the time. It's about hyping the crowd and riding the beat as rhythmically and intricately as possible. Nightbus dubplate is an impeccable example of that. However there is still so much content in there, but you need to know your onions and then it just gets better and better. His best albums are playtime's over, race against time and grime wave. The best of tunnel vision is a compilation of all his tunnel vision releases and is a good summary of those. Nightbus dubplate is on there as well. Other than that, recently he did the ""all fun and games till..."" vol 1 &amp; 2. Two free EPs of ten tracks each. A good example of where he's at these days. And probably a good start as its free. The Twitter downloads is another recent decent free release but not amazing. Does have a couple of incredible tracks on it though. His battle tracks are some of his best work - therapy battling, I got the vibe, sound boy killer, last day of 09 - all good examples. These rarely get released and tend to only exist on YouTube. Interesting to go back and look at his earlier work. When he was with pay as you go - know we, champagne dance - his flow on the latter is insane. That's from when he was a garage mc before grime even existed. That was like '02 or something. But as a basic beginners guide, check out 5 tracks - champagne dance, bow e3, night bus dubplate, last day of 09, crystal clear. Those tunes span over a decade. He's been the best for so long. In between which he almost single handedly created, marketed, developed, produced and maintained a brand new genre that gave careers to hundreds of people, on top of dozens of other off artists who he actually took a direct role in launching their careers by mentoring them e.g. chipmunk and tinchy stryder just for starters . And if you like what you've heard there's about 42 albums/EPs/releases that he's been involved in. Not to mention all the battles he's done as well. Plus all the 2 hour long radio shows he does. His tape with dizzee before they fell out, the sidewinder set as it's known, is a legendary piece of work, a collector's item. That was in 2002. The guy is a music making machine. He's genuinely one of my only 3 heroes (Bruce parry and michio kaku being the others). If you like the five tracks I've recommended then I'll do you a proper playlist.

We have laws right now which, conceivably, might change in the next 60 years. Maybe it will be legal to assist the suicide of a loved one who faces nothing but agony for the remaining months until they die of a terminal illness. Maybe people will no longer face jail for the mere possession of a video of consenting adults engaging in certain sexual activities (or drawings or fictional accounts of the same).

I think the welfare system is fantastic for helping people get through rough patches in their lives, or when they know they won't be able to work again. My issue is with the increasing amount of administrative shit that is dumped on already stretched doctors with nothing they can do about it. The situation is then made worse by them having to deal with people who are blatantly trying to con the system and the doctors are pushed into the position of having to either be knowingly complicit or deal with abuse.

You can get someone who turns up at a GP surgery having had two weeks off for some viral illness. During the time they were ill they didn't seek any medical assistance, which is fine because it probably wasn't necessary. Now they are being pushed by their employer to ask for proof, so they've got to lean on their GP to give some proof of an illness that they never bore witness to and has now passed.

Then you've got Dave who didn't turn up for his court hearing the day before. He says he had a migraine but again he didn't see the doctor and is fine now. Dave knows that a doctor's note is his literal get out of jail free card in this instance.

Next you've got Janice who was in a 10mph road traffic accident. She's come in to the doctors because she's got back pain consistent with the fabled [i]whiplash[/i]. Both patient and doctor know that it is total bullshit, but Janice needs to get a doctors visit on record so she can claim for more money. The doctor now needs to go through the motions of an examination while hoping that Janice won't say something that will necessitate him referring her for some expensive investigations that will waste taxpayers money. 

Notably, Janice comes in complaining that she's had to wait 20 minutes past her appointment time to be seen, and the doctor has to apologise for running late because they have just spent half an hour reassuring Mrs Bloggs, whose mum died of breast cancer five years ago and has now found a lump in her own breast. Of course the doctor can't give a reason for the lateness, they just have to apologise and deal with the patient's scorn.

The list of the scenarios can go on and on. They aren't rare either - quite often it's every 2nd or 3rd appointment. Most doctors will generally just do what the patient asks of them, because their responsibility is for the patient and not some shitty procedure or system.

&gt;Hi NotTheCEO,

&gt;I hope you are well. Please do not take this email personally, as it is written to your organisation. I would hope that you got into your line of work to help children, and for that I thank you. However, as you were the ""reply to"" for the email that was sent to me this morning:

&gt;This disgustingly misguided and ignorant point-scoring is pathetic, shallow and corrosive. I supported Childline, I supported the NSPCC. I was not a huge multi-million donor, but you guys had donations throughout the year through various means from me. I've done that for my whole adult life.

&gt;I'm unsubscribing from all communications with the NSPCC, and will not be donating again in future. I'm disappointed that politics and winning The Daily Mail crowd means more to your organisation than actually protecting children, and that you would abandon any civil liberties to do it. Only someone with a staggering ignorance of how the Internet functions, and indeed how people function, would think this would help children, or that the government are doing this to protect children. 

&gt;Known CAI hosts are already blocked by the secretive IWF blocklist, which is implemented by all the major ISPs in the UK anyway. As sort-of mentioned by the PM himself, in his speech, which most people won't read. Most people aren't even aware of the secretive blocklist though, except from when it inadvertently lead to Wikipedia being largely uneditable by UK citizens over the album cover fiasco a while back. This new announcement is all politics and PR.

&gt;The new measures will not ""protect children from being exposed to pornography"". I would wager that kids will make up the largest portion of the UK that circumvent these measures with ease. What these measures do, however, is give the government more overt censorship over Internet access in the UK. I'm not some tinfoil-hat wearing CCTV dodger, but if you can't see where this road is headed (especially in light of the PRISM/GCHQ revelations), I'm afraid the children of the UK are just getting another different nightmare added to their future. We complain when China does it, but we're installing the same infrastructure. But it's to make ""children safe""? Pull the other one.

&gt;My money, such as it is, will go to another children's charity. My only hope is that your ""victory"" is a Pyrrhic one and a better organisation rises from it's wake. I fear that won't be the case. I won't have my money squandered on political point scoring, I'd rather it went to actually helping children.

&gt;Thank you for your email and I am sorry that you will be withdrawing your support for the NSPCC because of our endorsement of the Prime Minister’s announcements about keeping children safe online on Monday. While we have removed you completely from all mailing lists, there is one more letter still on the way to you that we’re not able to stop from being sent. Please accept my apologies for any inconvenience caused through this.
 
&gt;I would like to assure that the NSPCC is not a partisan organisation.  We offer our backing for the policies of all of the major political parties on a case-by-case basis and only when we believe there to be significant and meaningful attempts to protect the nation’s children from cruelty and abuse.  In this instance, we believe the announcement marked a big step in the right direction and showed strong political commitment to stopping vile and illegal child abuse images and protecting young eyes from porn until they are old enough to make informed adult decisions.
 
&gt;I would like to stress that the NSPCC does not support censorship of any kind, and in our view there is no conflict with or curb on adult freedom to choose to see what they want as a result of the announced opt-in policy - people are simply being asked to make a choice and we think that that is a proportionate response to the problem. That is why we were happy to support it.
 
&gt;We do not and would not support anything that prevented adults from doing as they choose within the law. We believe the Government’s announcement on filtering in fact represents a crucial ‘back-stop’ in protecting children from viewing harmful inappropriate adult content just as the Government legislates to protect children from cigarettes and alcohol. 
 
&gt;We are also clear that choosing to block adult content is not a ‘silver bullet’.  Some adult content will certainly get past the filters, and so we continue to encourage parents to have open and honest conversations with their children about sex, relationships and respectful behaviour, both on and off line.
 
&gt;Thank you, again, for your email.  Should you wish to discuss the NSPCC’s policy position on internet safety further, please do contact me at the email address below.
 
&gt;Kind regards

Northampton is an odd place to live. I didn't especially enjoy it or have much time to explore it, because the job I had, which was just outside Northampton, took up most of my time.

There are a lot of creative and interesting people there, all struggling to get by, ending up frustrated and depressed because they have such big dreams, but can spend so little time doing the things they love. The pubs all had a 'fuck it, everything's shit, let's get pissed' camaraderie to them that was slightly soul-destroying but I think also enabled a lot of people to get by.

Divisions amongst groups organised along racial and national lines was more pronounced in any small space than I've ever seen. Somalis chewing khat suspiciously eyed Kosovans dealing guns and Pakistanis who seemed to have cornered the drugs market and boarded up empty houses to turn into weed factories, with a large chunk of the older white indigenous population seeming to become ever more fundamentalist in their sectarian religious alignments, but reluctantly integrating with the Africans who enthusiastically supported their versions of the Anglican churches, as they seemed to feel they had more in common with each other than the other groups, despite their predilection towards racism. 

The religious whites there all seem to think that the rest of the country and the Royal family have some kind of remnant disdain for them because of their ancestral support for Cromwell, but that's a chip on the shoulder that's invisible to anyone else in the rest of the country, who're probably unaware of it, let alone caring in the slightest.

Speaking of religion, there was also the ever-present 'Jesus Army', a cult-like entity that attracted addicts and recent convicts as well as the damaged zealots who gravitate towards such groups. They would stand around in multi-coloured camouflaged jackets, in turn unenthusiastically and then stridently attempting to recruit. The Jesus Army minibuses were everywhere, taking its coverts to work around the county, ostensibly doing Good Works, but in truth exploiting their labour and not passing on a fair wage. Everyone in Northampton had a story about someone raped or robbed when they'd turned to the Jesus Army for help, but little ever seemed to be proven.

All of this makes it a place where the creative types I've already mentioned produce some truly fucking morbid works. Bauhaus formed in Northampton and there was a club there - the Soundhaus - named for them. It closed down when I was living there and very shortly after to become yet another weed-growing factory. 

I think that perhaps, the massive quantities of weed produced and consumed there are the only thing keeping the different racial and religious groups that are all living on top of each other there from breaking into open conflict, and maybe it's only one too hot summer and bad police decision from going that way anyway.

Northampton is... well... imagine Hyacinth Bucket's middle England in one corner, Brixton's African diaspora in another, Bradford's asians to one side, and a bargain basement Scientology-type cult using the name of Jesus everywhere on the Streets, hard-as-all-fuck Eastern Europeans who look like they were chucked out of Spetsnaz keeping themselves to themselves, and a load of white kids, writers and artists who would probably be happier in Camden or Brixton, all orbiting the creative endeavours fuelled and lent credibility by Alan Moore's genius and on nod and hello terms with him too.

Thank you also for your email and for sharing with us your concerns about the NSPCC supporting the Prime Minister’s announcement on internet safety. 
 
&gt;We entirely agree with you that parents play a crucial role in keeping children safe online.  However, we also think that Government, schools and the internet industry all have a role to play in protecting children from the detrimental exposure to material which is not appropriate for their age.
 
&gt;We do not support censorship of any kind, and in our view there is no conflict with or curb on adult freedom to choose to see what they want as a result of the announced opt-in policy  - people are simply being asked to make a choice and we think that that is a proportionate response to the problem. That is why we were happy to support it.
 
&gt;We do not and would not support anything that prevented adults from doing as they choose within the law. We believe the Government’s announcement on filtering in fact represents a crucial ‘back-stop’ in protecting children from viewing harmful inappropriate adult content just as the Government legislates to protect children from cigarettes and alcohol. 
 
&gt;If you would like to discuss the NSPCC’s policy position on internet safety further, please contact me at the email address below.
 
&gt;Kind regards

true,grubbymitts,eu,"European Union ","Centropy and MaVen were years ago.  Security within Scene Topsites has greatly improved since then, just by what you can read on IRC channels and occasional scene news nfos.

Topsites are notoriously difficult to find these days.  They tend to be running hidden away on hacked servers (usually based in universities or businesses with massive amounts of bandwidth).  To get into the ""Scene"" you need to know people, who know people, who know people.  Then you need to prove you can offer something.  Then they may give you an address.  It may not be the Topsite's actual address, more of a proxy.  The Topsite will also migrate to other servers from time to time to ensure as much secrecy as possible.

So, with all this in mind, it really is easiest for the rights compaines just to block the sites.  For the majority of less than average computer users out there this will be enough to make them stop.  For those who take the time to read how to get around the blocks - seconds later they're back.  The BPI etc know this happens, but it's better than nothing.

As a result they have been forced to start selling shares and default on their bonds...

Customers are unaffected but from now on the company will have to follow the will of shareholders and put it's money into dividends for them where as before it was distributed to it's members (customers, staff and the Co-op parent group that also runs funeral homes, supermarkets etc).

true,rjw57,null,null,"A PhD typically takes 3 years and some change. It is unusual to have any taught classes[+] as part of a PhD since it is a research post but some departments may have some specific skills-focussed classes for first year students. These are presented as a learning resource to the students and so, if examined, the results are usually used as a guide for you and your supervisor to work out where your weak spots are rather than contributing to the success or failure of your PhD.

In the US a PhD will typically include teaching responsibilities including marking student's work and assisting in classroom focussed teaching sessions. In the UK this is not the case. In Cambridge there is an opportunity to earn some money by spending around an hour a week with pairs from a small group of undergraduate students discussing their current lecture courses. This is not required but can be useful to hone your own skills and may bring in some money.

It is generally expected that one spends the vast majority of your working time in research. One does not usually have a part time job when doing a UK PhD.

To look at it from the other point of view: US-style PhDs are viewed this side of the pond as fairly exploitative given a straw poll in my lab. Particularly, they're viewed as ""pre-doc post-docs"" and not opportunities to learn research skills and apply them to something of interest to you. Certainly the prevailing opinion is that they may be 5 years long but one has significantly less than 3 years actual research time during that.

[+] **Edit:** US PhDs tend to be like slightly heavier-weight undergraduate courses from my point of view. (And, dare I say it, a little more hand-holding.)

**Dont get me wrong** - Service at GPs could be a LOT better than it is, and I agree that things like online appointment booking, prescription renewal, cancellation etc. (which are available at most surgeries but not all) ought to be universal.

But at the end of the day, GPs will always have unexpected delays. These aren't usually because of poor planning or shoddy service - its just the nature of healthcare. For example, if one of their terminal cancer patients phones up to say he's in a lot of pain and can't breathe what would you expect them to do? -- Wait around and see you because its *'scheduled'* or jump in the car give that poor guy some morphine? It's annoying, but its life (or in that case, death) - the only consolation is that one day, if your unlucky enough to be the 'emergency' you'll get seen first to.

Then there is the problem of 'multiple issues'... you've said you don't want to be delayed, but you also want to discuss multiple issues.

It seems to happen a fair bit. 

There seems to be a lot of people who are on sick leave for a long time, so they'll be off for months at a time, then come back for a week or two, and then go off for a few more months. This means they're paying three or four people to do no work, meaning the place is understaffed. I agree with people being able to have sick leave, but from what my nan says a lot of them take the piss, and as soon as they come back they exaggerate feeling ill.

they have had to have a relationship out of necessity because of the american networking lobby and the paranoia about the company

also, former uk CIO John Suffolk joined Huawei in 2011 with prime ministerial permission - http://johnsuffolk.typepad.com/john-suffolk/2011/07/following-approval-from-the-uk-prime-minister-john-suffolk-to-join-huawei-as-their-global-head-of-cyber-security-reporting-to.html

there **very well** may be something dodgy about huawei (at least for the networking companies, they are all very aware there are teams of engineers at huawei who reverse engineer and rebuild their kit on the cheap... or so i've heard), but i think this browbeating, which crops up again and again in the US and over here, is a little hypocritical considering britain's tempora project

here's huawei's open letter about its history. http://www.huawei.com/en/about-huawei/newsroom/press-release/hw-092875-huaweiopenletter.htm

one thing it doesn't tend to be open about is whether it will ever go for an IPO and i think some senators a couple of years ago were kicking up a fuss because it could be partially funded by the bank of china (unfair, anticompetitive etc)

anyway, like i said it's entirely possible there is something shady about huawei, but this news is certainly interestingly timed considering what we **know** about britain, the US, canada, australia, NZ **actively spying right now on an unprecedented scale**

You're right. Lahana is an Emergency Contact System to bypass censorship so that people in Turkey can contact people in the Diaspora on mobile devices to let them know they're safe.

In itself not a major benefit to the local population because it's not much of a commuter route and is fairly quiet.

The change to the station layouts? Well yes they had to take into account the change in the local area with Westfield and the Olympics. I'd hardly call a station layout a major achievement.

Overground? That's not really specific to Stratford nor the Olympics, and is a wider plan for Londoners in general.

Improvements to roads? Where?

Basically you seem to be pinning 12 years worth of improvement on the Olympics... which is pretty much total bollocks.

no it's not hard to do that at all. except doing that won't stop any porn coming into your home. you need to pick through the results (the first thing that was relevant appears at the 5th result for me) and then implement what the articles say. In my case its this article:

So back in the summers of 2007-2009 I was still going to a summer camp that would occasionally get some really awesome counselors from across the globe.  In 2007 a guy who from England who had the *weirdest* British accent my 15 year old self at the time had ever heard was one of the counselors.  When I found out he was my counselor I was extremely excited, because he sounded like a really cool person, and when I walked into the cabin he had all sorts of really weird banners, scarves, and jerseys on the wall.  My first question to him what did it all mean? (At the time, not only did I not know anything about football, but I also claimed to ""hate"" it, or think that it was ""gay.' 15 year old me was a bit of a moron.) 

Now to remind you, this was 2007, around two weeks after Liverpool just lost to Milan in the Champions League final. He sat me down (I was the only kid there at that point, I was one of the ""teen helpers"" in the cabin) and started this huge explanation on how awesome Liverpool was, how they had just made what is essentially the super bowl of european football, but SO much bigger, and more important.  He told me about the comeback against this team called ""AC Milan"" in 2005 to win it in amazing fashion.  He then went into their history, how in the 70's and 80's Liverpool WAS English Football, and how Anfield was a place to be terrified to play as an away team in.

true,thatstevelord,cnty-england,AmazingBlazingBasingstoke,"They're not talking about blocking rape porn (which I would define as porn with actual rape, which is already blocked and illegal). They're talking about blocking perfectly legitimate porn in which all parties involved have consented and records are kept and (usually) displayed with the porn to prove this. The thing is, this sort of porn isn't even illegal.

The problem with blocking otherwise legal pornographic material is that it's a big step forward. Blocking tv or torrent sites is stupid, but there's at least a basis in law to say that the law is being broken by facilitating breaches of copyright in this way. Rape porn is not illegal. Regular porn is not illegal. Implementing a default filter means that you will be recorded as someone that opts out. If you think it will stop with porn and won't be expanded then you're possibly in with the same people who thought that CCTV and ANPR wouldn't end up being abused.

In every single instance where the surveillance state has been expanded in this country it has worked against innocent people. People routinely have their privacy invaded through CCTV. Everyone driving through a particular area of Royston gets their entire journey logged by the police regardless of suspicion. Everyone's Internet access routed out of the UK (and a lot of data is routed out then back in deliberately in order to force this) is recorded for 3 days by an agency completely unaccountable to the public.

If that isn't a surveillance state I don't know what is. Censorship is only the next stage in expanding thoughtcrime.

Let me put it another way. Lets say we ban porn and then it's expanded to include hate speech in some wonderfully woolly way (as much of the legislation that's brought in is deliberately vague and far reaching). This could be used in combination with the ASBO successor bill currently in parliament to stop you from being able to protest, to talk about a protest, to put up a website that opposes a group of people and to have such a site rendered inaccessible within the UK.

true,Colinfucius,lfc99,,"Rant time - you've been warned. This is a fantastic post and really shows just how much of a clusterfuck the transfer window is. When it's in *everyone's* interest to blow things out of proportion, this is the result. Think about it:

**Agents** want to make money on expensive transfers, so they lie about clubs inquiring about their player. If it gets *someone* to look at the player out of curiosity, the lie has done its job as far as the agent is concerned. Not to mention third party ownership, which has made this window an absolute mess.

**Newspapers and websites** want traffic, ad revenue, and to be at the center of controversial discussion. All they have to do is write a sensational headline attacking good players on good teams with large fanbases. They don't even pretend to have sources anymore.

**Random assholes on twitter** who have no sources, no discernible talents, and no accountability can continue to lie and get retweeted without consequences. They get off on it, and everyone's obliging them. I hope their children are ugly and never learn to read and die alone.

**Supporters** eat this shit up. Sports is an entertainment industry, and nothing is more entertaining than fantasizing about your club picking up that perfect puzzle piece, or your rival drowning in its own tears at having lost its best player. There's a reason these rumours continue to get upvoted. People want to believe them, and journos are feeding fans exactly what they want.

**Clubs** want to hide their transfer activity and mislead their competition about who they're targeting. Just saw this with us this week about targeting a ""mystery"" 15 year old so that no one else tries to snipe us. Honestly, I don't know why clubs don't take that approach with all of their scouting. 

At the same time, clubs want to damage competition. They do this by starting rumors about the best players on other teams (Suarez, Rooney, you name it) to try to unsettle them. Unfortunately, Suarez takes the bait every time. Is there a single credible source on earth that has an actual *quote* showing Real Madrid have any interest in him? 

I'm telling you right now that Arsenal looked at the situation and said, ""Let's test Liverpool's resolve here. We put in a bid to get one of the best strikers in the world at a bargain price. Either we get him on the cheap, or it encourages another team to swoop in. Either way he's *gone* from one of our top competitors for top four next year. Worst case scenario, we've unsettled the club, the player, and the fans!"" 

This is all happening because Arsenal sees us as a threat. I've said it before, but it needs to be said again: Liverpool will *not* sell Luis Suarez. 1) He is a phenomenal player and fits our system perfectly. 2) We are not able to reliably attract similar (or even slightly worse) level quality right now (see: Mkhitaryan). 3) A lot of talent is already locked up this window, and time is running out. 4) Our organization will avoid last summer's fiasco at all costs - being stuck with a pile of money and no players to spend it on. All of our eggs in one basket and nothing to show for it. Thank God we had such a phenomenal January window.

To put it as simply as possible, it's not up to anyone else! Not the player, not Arsene Wenger's yard sale money, not these phantom contract clauses. It's up to us. And Liverpool **will not sell its best (and maybe only) chance at its return to glory this season.** To think that we'd then sell him to a top four rival is so fucking laughable that I'm glad John Henry finally acknowledged it.

You cannot simply argue against me by redefining terms and then saying I am wrong because the terms are now redefined. Rape porn is porn featuring rape (simulated or actual), which is precisely what they are trying to block.

&gt; The thing is, this sort of porn isn't even illegal

Isn't it? There's actually quite a lot of debate on that subject I believe. Until the law has been introduced though we don't know if it will criminalise whatever is being blocked.

&gt; If you think it will stop with porn and won't be expanded then you're possibly in with the same people who thought that CCTV and ANPR wouldn't end up being abused

This is just a silly slippery slope argument. You might as well object to the blocking of child porn along the same lines.

Tonge/Norris/Green/Brown/Drury/etc. are all very, very average players. We need to get rid of them to clear up 50k in wages (est.)

But lets not pretend that they are just complete deadwood today because they had some poor parts of the season. The reason we didnt get relegated wasnt because these players were in the squad. It was because Warnock had no idea how to accurately pair them with more attacking/creative players (who we didnt have).

We need more players. But this is a project. Lets give the team (and the board) a few months to settle down. It's been a busy summer (three signings, two on big money and one who looks great) and lots of lovely new backroom staff and sponsorship.

However, during a particularly bad 2-month episode this year, I paid over £300 on my £24-per-month phone contract due to calling NHS direct and the samaritans, simply because I felt at times I needed to talk to someone about how I felt and what I was worried about.  This was in order to avoid going to the doctors surgery, or rushing to A&amp;E over something that was not a problem.

After finally seeing my GP and saying that I wanted some sort of resolution, they finally put me on the MH waiting list, after knowing I suffered like this for around 3-4 years.  After a few weeks of waiting I ended up paying for counsellor sessions myself, at around £40 a session.  After 8-weeks of waiting, I finally got a phone call, in which they advised me to see a counsellor, and they'd put me on another waiting list for one if I wanted.

Rodwell(22) should definitely be in the mix as an alternate for Yaya especially in other cups. He can be developed into a future starter for Yaya (30). For this reason plus his English nationality, he is crucial to the squad. 

Barry can be used as a strong tactical weapon when defense is a priority for when we are protecting a lead. He is a relatively cheap, durable, and gritty player that can anchor the midfield and bring experience to the lads.

Garcia will have a tough time getting in the mix as he is the odd man out. He might get some time here and there in less meaningful matches. His value is too low to sell. Thus, the best plan for him and the team is for Garcia to be a CB cover. He would be second choice to Lescott, but would still be valuable in this role.

I have plenty of friends who’ve suffered ACL tears, and I have suffered a pretty severe MCL injury, and even when the docs say the knee and ligament is fine, there is always the underlying fear of re-injuring it. 

When that happens, you favor the knee more, you are a step slower and more careful and deliberate with your movements... in essence you are THINKING about playing instead of REACTING and playing... this might slow you down a step, make you more cautious etc. 

Everything i see from Sandro however indicates he is mentally ready, which in my opinion is the biggest hurdle.

true,DoktorStrangelove,lfcwfmm,,"I agree with every point about United, and there are numerous examples from the more competitive leagues in recent years (i.e. not La Liga) of massive teams that have stumbled mightily after even minor transitional hiccups. Ourselves and Inter are the two most obvious recent examples that come to mind. The fact that this is the most competitive the PL has *ever* been just makes it all the more likely that United could get displaced in the top 4, once you consider all the factors that could conspire against them. I think if they get stuck in an early rut and/or suffer a crucial injury, I'm not totally certain they'll recover like they always did under Fergie, and they could be in for a VERY difficult season that may end in a massive reality check. 

Of course I rarely mention any of these theories to anyone, and only ever in hushed tones...don't want to jinx it.

Edit: I think City will be top 2 on sheer strength of personnel, a team that good should be contending for the league even if they hired a baby goat as manager. Chelsea are a similar story right now. Both teams hired excellent managers, however, with perhaps the advantage going to Chelsea since Mou already has experience with the club and some of the players.

I seem to recall Torres had a rather impressive goal scoring record before joining Chelsea. Injuries aside, we've made a habit of buying the best strikers around who have failed to live up to expectations (remember Schevchenko).

Last seasons 16 goal tally puts him behind Lukaku's 17. Admittedly he has had great seasons in the past, but there's a risk when buying older strikers that they flop in a new team. I don't think we need a playmaker - our midfield is chock full of beautiful talent (Mata, Hazard, KDB, Oscar to name a few). 

I can see why some might argue we need a proven star striker, but honestly I believe this will be Lukaku's season to shine, Torres still has goals left in him, and Ba's only been given half a season to prove himself.

true,ibpants,1972crest,,"I think it's fair to say that we will have 2 spots on the pitch for that position.  I think that pairing Yaya up with Fernandinho or Rodwell will reduce his attacking burden since these guys can take turns going forwards, also it probably makes us a touch less predictable since it would generally be the case that Yaya would join the attack much sooner than Barry.

I really like Barry but I do worry that Pellegrini will see him as too cautious.  I don't know a huge amount about Pellegrini's tactics, but you hear about how attacking he is and it concerns me that Barry's defensive astuteness will cost him.  From what we saw of Javi Garcia last season, he can't pass, can't tackle, can't run, can't do much on the evidence at hand, but he *can* get his head on the end of a lofted corner.

Do we need all 5 for 2 spots?  Given Rodwell's fitness record and our lack of cover in the centre of defence, it seems likely, but if Pellegrini and Begiristain disagree then I worry about Barry's future.

From what I've seen of Razak, he strikes me as another player that will be comfortable on either the front or back foot.  He reminds me of my perception of Rodwell back at Everton, currently slightly over-cautious, putting in safe but uninspiring passes and a little reticent to carry the ball any meaningful distance on his own - I feel like he just needs a moment of clarity where he realises that he is just as capable of shaping the play as anyone else.

I'm also interested in Emyr Huws.  I've only seen a bit of him this close season but from that snippet it looks like he's benefitted from a loan spell.  It seems to me that he *does* realise that decisions need to be made, and maybe he'd feel differently under the pressure of the Premier League, but he could be worth keeping an eye on.

I don't know if this is the appropriate time to talk about Colin Bell - generally regarded as City's greatest ever player - because he *was* a central midfielder, but I don't know exactly what modern role you'd assign him such was the completeness of his game.  In today's City squad you'd probably see him in a more attacking role, but since he was definitely a central midfielder, this is where I'm putting him. He was before my time, but it's Colin Bell, so naturally I've watched a lot of recordings and he really deserves the plaudits.  I don't know that I can really do justice to him.  Impeccable technique, fantastic distributor of the ball, an eye for goal, a hard worker, stamina like you wouldn't believe.  You know what?

As for players of more my era, Paul Lake was the big hope for City.  A great player, with strong defensive awareness, composure beyond his age, but also an inventiveness for picking a pass.  I don't like to bring the rags into this but had Lake stayed in shape the England team would have had a period in which their midfield was built on a potentially world-beating Mancunian combination of Lake and Scholes and that would really have been something to see, but Lake didn't stay in shape.  He broke his cruciate ligament, a fairly minor injury nowadays, but the treatments weren't up to today's standards.  He worked hard to recover but broke it again and again.  The club (perhaps to it's shame) seemed to give up on Lake's recovery sooner than he did - he did, however, rejoin City in recent years as a club ambassador and has since moved on to work directly with the Premier League.

As for a specific moment, I vividly remember when Lake swallowed his tongue.  That was such a terrifying moment.  I didn't know what was happening and was genuinely worried that I was watching a man die.  The same thing happened a few years later to Steve Lomas but Paul Walsh sorted it out in no time (nothing he could do about the broken leg though).

I think we need an uplifting moment after that. http://www.mcfc.com/News/Team-news/2013/May/Great-FA-Cup-goals-Yaya-Toure-v-Man-United-2011",0,1374854981,null,0,false,0,cbas6iw,t3_1j3ejt,t1_cbas6iw,t3_1j3ejt,null,1430327516,3,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,3

true,Kesuke,null,null,"Not as high as you might think -- But the problem is ""waste of time"" appointments aren't black and white... some people come in with seemingly stupid problems, but its all relative. You get middle aged men who can't sleep for more than 2 hours at night because their prostate has them up pissing drips every couple of hours - yet they won't visit the GP because they've found ways to cope. On the flipside you get teenage girls with a single spot and its ruining their lives - they can't face going into school, let alone sitting in an exam hall to do an important GCSE. So although its a seemingly pathetic problem, the ramifications are actually quite serious and GPs will try to intervene aggressively to treat that sort of psychological problem. 

Plus, individual consultations aren't individual illnesses.... so for example an elderly woman might come in with a ""waste of time"" problem, and the GP might note to themself that she seemed a bit forgetfull - after 2 or 3 similar consultations like that they begin to build up a picture of someone who is actually in the early stages of dementia, so a valuable diagnosis is reached even though that wasn't what the woman was coming in for.

GPs don't want to do this because of what people on this reddit percieve to be ""waste of time"" appointments - they want to do it to cut back on what GPs call ""frequent attenders""... these are people who visit the surgery once or twice a week, over several years. Often they are elderly patients who want to come in for a chat and it becomes an established part of their routine that they are very reluctant to give up on. This sort of appointment is somewhat costly, but more than anything I suspect it's personally draining for the GPs to deal with and thats probably their main motive here.

If he *is* the type (again, we have very little evidence that he is, but there is a shred) then he needs to go, I think.  Getting a big chunk of cash and a highly-rated, nearly-there striker from Real may be best.

If only.  Actually, it's much more civil; if you feel your company is not treating you properly, you call your local office, ask to speak to the officer that represents you; one of the officer's secretaries will go through the details with you and arrange for the officer to talk to you.

The officer will make sure you get useful advice - such as raising grievances within the companies own policies - and then, if the company still isn't behaving, will assist you with your appeal.  If the company is still being daft, the officer may well suggest a meeting between you, your officer and the company to try and thrash out the situation.

Of course, the officer may let you know that what the company doing is correct, and they *can* be doing that to you - but it all depends on what's being done.  For example, if they're doing what they say in your contract, there's little that can be done.

true,nowonmai666,lfc99,null,"I would be furious if Liverpool sold Suarez for £40m. Yes he wants to play in the Champions league, *but so does every player at the club*. With plenty of time left on his contract, the only reason to sell Suarez is if the deal is in Liverpool's favour; that is to say, it ends up leaving the club in a better position than it is now.

* we're not going to get a player of Suarez's quality for £40m.
* we're having trouble enticing players in the £20m bracket to come to a club with no European football. And we have the money to spend on that level of player even without selling Suarez.

A few deals would appeal to me: a swap deal for an established player who is a definite first-teamer good as Suarez, plus a lot of money. Walcott + 20, for instance.

Selling Suarez for his market value (which is surely no less than Cavani) would allow significant improvements. But £40m is not enough: it's half of what people are talking about for Bale. Is Suarez really only 80% as good as Torres? (And there's no logical reason why Liverpool should be in the business of granting discounts for players who are a bit bitey; Suarez's value should reflect his ability. Don't want to buy a player who bites? Fine, he can play for us.)

Let him play for another year; with so many teams having new managers, who knows where we will finish?

Except that they are and if you want to stimulate more decision then your best bet is not to pit this as one idea against the other, case in point you asking this

&gt;This is surely a much more important issue than a filter?

and then saying this

&gt;Like I said, let's have a discussion without making it about the filter, if you possibly can. You don't need to explain anything at all about the filter in order to contribute to this discussion. This is about the proposed change in law to make violent pornography illegal, not the filter. If you want to discuss the filter so desperately then by all means contribute in one of the probably 20+ threads already around.

*You* brought the filter up. *You* made it a question of what you perceive as people picking on issue over another, not me. *You* asked if this is more important than the filters and I answered. So you can't then blame *me* for that. 

If you wanted a decision just on the topic at hand you could have easily set one up ""Lets talk more about how they are making some porn illegal"" would have worked and as I've stated in replies elsewhere as this is an issue that greatly a number of people I care about I'd have been happy to talk *just* about that. But you didn't so we haven't.

In my opinion a central midfielder should be able to drop back and perform defensive duties when necessary, and since most teams play with more than one center midfielder, one can usually be spared for defensive duties. Fernandinho and Jack both appear to be likely partners for Yaya in the center next year, and that means Barry will likely struggle for starts, which is unfortunate, but may end up being for the best. While Barry's been a hugely important player for us, to me it's difficult to justify using a place in the starting line up on a player who only performs that one specific role, and while he performs it very well, I think Barry's lack of athleticism, and generally conservative style of play leave city lacking edge in center midfield, especially when Yaya isn't on top of his game. If you look at the FA cup final, Yaya and Barry were essentially just taking up space, and the lack of a strong central midfield presence fucked us. That wasn't an isolated incident either. Personally, I like Barry a lot, and we should keep him around if he's willing to stay because there are situations where you need a dedicated defensive mid, but I'd like to see us starting with more versatile players more often this season.

Bertrand is improving every season. Who said he'll ever be Cole-esque quality? Most LB's will never reach that, being that one time he was the best in the world. 

Shaw isn't flavor of the month, he's been on Chelsea's radar for a couple years. He'll prove to be the next great LB in 3 to 4 years. 

Ramires is great but doesn't have the physicality that Khedira has. 

De Bruyne is attacking, he doesn't play back as much and again doesn't have the physicality. 

Luiz is a CB and will always be. The midfield experiment was cute, even played well at times, but he is a great *CB* and will always be for Chelsea. 

Essien is aging, he can't be that box-to-box player that Kedira can for 60+ games Chelsea seem to play when they are in all the competitions they are in. He also doesn't really have that technical ability that Khedira is so good at. Khedira is at the ripe age of 26 and in the prime of his career. 

How the bloody hell did Dave not prove to you that he is the real deal last season? I mean, he was arguably our best buy of last summer when you consider the price we paid and his potential for the future. You are hard to please aren't ya?

I think you need to revaluate our midfield. We have holding midfielders, we have great attacking midfielders. Saying that Baines adds more to the team this season than Sami Khedira is just mad. I don't know what you're on about but you are absolutely insane. While we have very strong depth we don't have a world class box-to-box mid like Khedira. I know we have Lampard but he is aging just like Essien and with Khedira means Lampard doesn't have to play as many minutes. I still rate Lampard very highly looking at what he did last season. Van Ginkel maybe in a couple years can be that guy, but right now he isn't. He is very promising though. Mikel is a defensive minded player and can't do what Khedira is capable of. Can Oscar become a box-to-box midfielder? *Possibly*. He doesn't have the physical tools yet, but he is till maturing. Also, I think Jose will use him in the attack more. 

Khedira is a great option at that price and exactly what Chelsea could use in midfield. But surely they wont let him go for that cheap.

Suarez is ambitious; he's trying to get to the top. He has no more affection for Liverpool than he did for his stepping-stones in Holland. Of course he and his agent are always looking for the next move, the same way most people would quite fancy a promotion if one's on offer.

But he was happy enough to take a pay rise when he signed a new contract less than a year ago. Life at Liverpool can't be that bad.

There's a middle ground between being utterly desperate to see out your career at Liverpool and being utterly desperate to get away. Suarez is in that middle ground: of course he'd like to improve his situation with a move to club that's playing at a higher level, and of course he's trying it on, but he knows that if nobody wants him enough to pay his market value then he can't go anywhere.

If he doesn't get his move this summer, he'll keep on playing.

In theory, any GP could offer a private service instead of an NHS one, but there are rules. A patient living in the practice area has a right to register with you as an NHS patient if you have an open list (and there are financial penalties for closing your list). Nor would it be permissible to offer existing NHS patients the chance to re-register as private patients.

true,standuptomagic,null,null,"&gt;Suarez isn't ""keen"" to join Arsenal or leave Liverpool.

Your 3rd comment on the thread. If Suarez isn't keen to leave Liverpool, he wouldn't have said he was open to leaving. He would also have rejected Arsenal (or anyone else's) bid for him. He would most definitely have made a public statement about staying in the club. 

&gt;Really? If it isn't speculation why has no transfer request been filed? Liverpool openly gave him that option and the deadline for that has passed.

From your 4th comment in the thread. Here, you make a few assumptions. Firstly, you assume that someone can only desire something if he/she takes action on the desire. He can have the desire to leave the club without making a transfer request. Your 2nd assumption is that there is a deadline for making a transfer request, as if any request made after that deadline becomes invalid. Suarez can very well wait for offers to be made, decide if the offers are good, and **then** make a transfer request to force the move. 

&gt; There have also been NUMEROUS players who have talked about leaving in recent history (Bale, Benteke, Walcott, Rooney, Tevez) who have yet to leave

That's my point. A player can simultaneous want to leave a club and want to stay at the same time. Suarez's words tell of an intention to leave Liverpool for a **good** Champions League club. This means no Celtic, or PAOK Salonika or Galatasaray. If no good Champions League clubs come knocking, he is also happy to stay. What you're saying is that Suarez definitely doesn't want to leave, simply because you haven't seen any definitive proof (to you) that he wants to leave. 

So here's some proof that there is desire for Suarez to leave: 

1. Speaking of wanting to play for a Champions League club, preferably outside England. Later on announces joy that English clubs are interested in him. Both these statements have been reported by James Pearce of Liverpool Echo, who would surely have made amendments or corrections if they were poorly translated, considering his ties with Liverpool FC. 

2. Arsenal's 40million and 1 pound bid. This bid clearly shows that there is some sort of clause at 40 million pounds. Clearly, Arsenal received information about said clause. You can believe the leak to be someone from Liverpool (unlikely) or from Suarez's agent (more likely). If Suarez's agent did something against the wishes of his employer, he would either get sacked or Suarez would say something to the contrary. 

3. In all of Ayre and Rodgers' statements, they have not communicated Suarez's desire to stay. They have said that he is a Liverpool player, that he is under-contract, but not that he wants to stay. Contrast that with, say, Fabregas, who Barcelona insists is desirous of staying in the club. 

4. Rodger's only just called on Suarez to show loyalty to the club and fans. If a player who he meets daily for training has never shown any desire to leave, surely this is unnecessary? 

Nobody is saying that he wants **ONLY** to leave this season, or **ONLY** to Arsenal. The easiest conclusion to get out of all this is that A, He wants to go to a better club; B, He doesn't mind going to Arsenal if the offer is good; and C, He also doesn't mind staying if **no better options** are available. Your argument is more or less ""If there is no definitive proof that he is adamant on leaving or adamant on joining Arsenal, then he definitely doesn't want to leave and definitely not to Arsenal.""

So yeah, let's face it, our current squad is a bit shit, and this is because of Colin, and to an extent Grayson (at least Grayson did his best under Bates, where as Colin Brought in substandard players for cash) so I doubt we'll get very far this season, but I'm still hoping for a play off spot. That being said, Brian has his mind set on reshaping the squad, hell the club even, from top to bottom and well, that takes time.

By this time next year, I'd say we'll still be in the championship, but that's the time to make our push. By then we'll have a better squad, better finances and a better chance at maintaining our spot in the prem whenever we reach it. As i write this now, I can't for the life of me think off the top of my head, a singe great player at Cardiff, or Hull, and bar Zaha (who really doesn't count) Crystal palace. Even after their summer spending, and the Premiership a few weeks away their squad isn't at a good standard yet. But how did they do so well to get promotion? They all had a good system down, and that's what we need, but we need time to install it and be rid of hoofball.

Brian has a lot of work to do to get us to where we want, and to an extent need to be, but I strongly believe he can do it. We need to stop this pessimistic bullshit that's been with the club for a long time. GFH are doing their best to bring us the experience Bates never even batted an eye at, so they need out support too.

I know Brian Mcdermott would never do anything to harm the club he is at. You can tell this by how much the sacking at Reading got to him, and further more, why he never spent massive amounts of money on players. here, at Leeds I don't think he wants to spend big either (well not like Qpr standards) and look withing for future stars, namely Byram and Lees of course but also Dawson and Mowatt to name a few of the youth team players.

**Ninja Edit** I'm guessing aswell Red Bull will be our new sponsors, but they won;t invest anything until their name is on our shirt, which won't be until next year.

Building a club takes time, and doing it right takes longer. I truly believe Crystal Palace, Hull and Cardiff will be with us next season as I don't think they have the talent among them to stay up. Especially with the premiership's mid table sides signing a fierce amount of talent.

I'm not sure what u mean about 'not all things must be choice'; but whatever way, this is a matter of choice.  Children are educated and given a choice to do what they want of the things they can.  This is a basic right we extend to every young citizen.  
This child will face extraordinary coercion due to the family to which he was born.  Such arbitrary limits on one's choice are unjust.


If the monarchy spices up life in the UK that is certainly a moral benefit, however is it a rather insignificant one, and i wonder what single right of one individual you think can legitimately be taken away for the sake of a bit of bunting?

He's 20 years old now and I don't think he'll ever really break into our first team. He's competing against Coutinho, Luis Alberto, Henderson, and Suso now. Get a few million off him, possibly a future sell-on clause, and we'd be doing okay financially.

They seem to have a pretty sweet ass [Guildhall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Northampton_Guildhall01.JPG). Much like its neighbour Kettering, it's (historically) a shoe-making town.

I guess my point is I wouldn't sell him to Arsenal for £55M, and I wouldn't sell him to Madrid for less than £55M.

His salary is maybe £8M a year?  I would rather keep him on the bench and take the £8M loss than sell him at a cut rate price to anyone who thinks they can push the club around (including Guardiola, Suarez, Arsenal, Madrid, and God Himself).  It's the principle of the matter to me.

We just don't have the depth to pull it off. You need to be firing on all cylinders right from the start of the season, and for example we already have super Jan missing most likely 1-2 games. Not only will he not be recovered until after the season starts, he will be far behind getting his fitness levels up. So even when he is ""fit"" he wont physically have the 90 minutes in him the rest of the squad do. Yes Kaboul is back but he hasn't played for an entire season. 

Not to mention we have not even seen Chadli or Paulinho play for Spurs yet.

It's a nice thought, and we no doubt have a very young and exciting squad, but lets be a little realistic and focus on becoming an established CL side.

That is probably your exchange, but try with your postcode if you know it.

The problem with asking for a good provider is a users only share the ISP network once you have gotten onto it, which is only half the story - getting to it is the other half. So you get some who say x is great and some who say x is terrible. For example, their local exchange might be rammed hence they get a crap connection, whilst someone else's is well below capacity and they don't have any issues. 

The bad news is according to that your options for the first half are be/o2/sky/easynet (all about to be the Sky, who dont have a great rep but the once mighty Be seem to have gone full retard lately), TalkTalk or BT. Most other ISPs will be available but they will be using one of those 3's gear for that first half (and might mean their cheapest packages aren't available).

The good news is you have FTTC (fibre to the cabinet) in maybe just a month's time. I don't know much about that as I can't get it but obviously that is a very good thing :) I don't think that ""first half"" will matter so much and you'll get very nice speeds if you are willing to pay for it.

Polio hasn't been eradicated and still exists in Africa. It hasn't been renamed. Polio vaccination worked in the USA, the UK and most of the western world. Do you think that the western world has magically made people with paralysis from polio disappear? What has it been renamed as? The polio vaccine works. The reason it hasn't been fully eradicated is due to people being told vaccines are bad, especially in Nigeria where there has been an increase in polio due to people not getting their children vaccinated.

Vaccines have caused the number of people to die of measles, some forms of meningitis, diphtheria, tetanus and others to drop significantly. Also for the number of still born and severely disabled children being born due to their mother contracting rubella to drop.

Liverpool rejected Arsenal’s £40,000,001 bid for the Uruguay forward this week and, contrary to reports, have refused the player permission to hold talks with his suitors over personal terms before a potential move.*",0,1374872324,null,0,false,0,cbaz0x3,t3_1j4cjd,t1_cbaz0x3,t3_1j4cjd,null,1430324220,14,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,14

i didn't say you couldn't be a fan without watching the original show, i said you **didn't have a basis for analysing the writing ** without understanding the context and the material that is being  drawn from. 

 for example i consider myself a fan of the game of thrones tv show,  but i don't feel i have any authority to make a good critical analysis of the story and  themes in it until i've read the books, which i haven't

here let me make a better example, i've been writing a paper on sleep deprivation in law enforcement, i'm not going to be comfortable about the validity of my paper until i've read and considered every single piece of literature i can find on the subject and considered its context to my research. doing anything else would be negligent of me and would undermine the validity of my  work.

true,pcjonathan,smith,Smith,"I have no idea to be honest. I've seen it so many times, it's strange. /r/DoctorWho and /r/Gallifrey share a lot of things. We share the same spoiler policy. Share some wiki articles. Hell, we both share some mods. 

The major difference is, /r/Gallifrey ONLY allows NEWS and DISCUSSION forever. It's a specialist subreddit designed to be a shoot-off/spin-off and NOT a replacement or a full-blown alternative. /r/DoctorWho allows a lot more things and has a LOT more subscribers where it's quality can fluctuate.

As a whole, members of /r/Gallifrey are usually sprouted off from /r/DoctorWho because they want discussions and feel /r/DoctorWho isn't up to high enough standards. These people are usually the ones who loath /r/DoctorWho, mainly due to things like not knowing Classic exists and Tennant Fan-Girls.

On the other hand, most people on /r/DoctorWho don't even know /r/Gallifrey exists, and I've not yet seen people who loathe it. However, some have criticised it for thinking that everyone there are elitists, classic fans and hate new-who, which while it is not the case...it does happen a fair bit.

But there's not THAT much of a rivalry between them or hatred. Mostly because they mix rather well, and both realise that they fit people's standards better instead of being ""KING OF THE LAND"" sort of thing. Oh and there's at least a rule against it on /r/Gallifrey ;)

The problem, however, is not between /r/DoctorWho and /r/Gallifrey. It is between /r/DoctorWho and /r/DoctorWhumour, i.e. The place where all rejected content from here goes. I admit, I'm not subscribed to it so I don't know the general atmosphere of it, but I have been linked to threads (either comment threads or entire posts) on there far too many times that just complain, bitch and insult this subreddit, and even more so, it's mods, which is quite heart-breaking sometimes. Usually because the original submitters didn't bother to read the rules of this subreddit or just wanted karma and then started going off on one. [\(A bit like this comment and the entire thread that was on /r/Funny\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1ioxov/got_removed_for_content_from_rdoctorwhowell/cb6n91y)

So in short, to use an analogy. /r/DoctorWho is the father. The eldest. The biggest. The one who started it all. /r/Gallifrey is the mother. The one who listens. The one who discusses. The parents work hand-in-hand with one another and are mature. /r/DoctorWhumour can be that bitchy whiny kid who didn't get their way (though like I said...don't go there so I don't know what else there is, only what I've seen).",0,1374875315,null,0,false,0,cbb03ol,t3_1j4fiu,t1_cbb03ol,t3_1j4fiu,null,1430323713,10,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,10

Although, apparently, it does happen, and I'd love to get to interview a handful of women that gave birth after never realizing they were pregnant to gain some perspective, and not just writing a story based purely on what I assume it would be like(Especially as a male that has never given birth at all, nor will he ever).

Compare that to Big Finish audios like Scherzo or Dark Eyes where we actually get to see The Doctor through his depression, get into his head a little bit, and listen as he overcomes his depression.

As we said above, most people just don't realise that about 50% of the NHS infrastructure (the GPs) are (and have always been) private enterprises, and these recent changes have opened up the other 50% to takeover. It could even spark the end of the hub-spoke hospital model, with a new system of private specialist hospitals doing the bulk of the elective work.  

But in many respects I'm actually all for it -- because I think progressive privatisation is probably one of the few things that will improve working conditions for staff in the NHS, particularly in hospitals. The public should fear it for good reason though because paying staff reasonable salaries, providing services at a commercial standard and achieving good margins for shareholders will all mean paying **a lot** more money for their healthcare. But for years and years NHS staff have argued that the service urgently needs more money - well here is their oppourtunity, and for those willing to take that up this is an exciting time, with a lot of potential for new and improved services and better pay/conditions.

The inevitable downside is that some patients are going to find they are priced out of these wonderful new creations. Personally I think they'd be better off spending less time shouting down any form of privatisation (simply because its been institutionally engrained in them that this is bad) and spend more time establishing what their red lines are - i.e. what is the minimum level of healthcare provision they think that those who can't afford to pay should have, and make sure this is enshrined in law.",0,1374878561,null,0,false,0,cbb16ng,t3_1j1s0e,t1_cbb16ng,t1_cbavtdg,null,1430323203,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Similarly, if you're registered as a deductible gift recipient (so donations are deductible from the donor's taxable income) but not all of your activities meet the requirements for deductible gifts, donors can only claim a deduction for the proportion which is spent on approved uses (for which education is a valid use but preaching is not, for examples).

The ghost of transfer windows past will be an effervescent young and beautiful Martin Jol. He will bring you all the way back to early 2006 when a wistful, magical young lad named Dimitar Berbatov stole your heart. You loved Berba and Berba loved you. Things for once were beginning to look up. The beautiful Jol shows you the happiest you have ever been, starry eyed and full of hope.


The ghost of transfer windows present will present himself to you as a gregarious, massive Baldini. He will be wearing a robe made from the shock white fur of arctic wolves. He will show you the home of one of Tottenham's hardest working employees. Mr. Andre Villas-Boas. You see Mr. Villas-Boas is still celebrating the transfer window, even though he knows he doesn't always get what he deserves. He puts on a brave face and carries on the best he can. His spirit cannot even be quelled by the unfortunate leg injury to his young son, Tiny Jan. Andre Villas-Boas knows things could've been much worse for his young son. 


The loud and cheerful ghost of transfer windows present shows you that you should be thankful for what you have. Before leaving his mood becomes somber and dire. The ghost opens his robe and exposes the gaunt, filthy, ragged bodies of William Gallas and David Bentley. As he forces you to gaze upon them, he tells you there names are 'Over' and 'The Hill.' 


The ghost of transfer windows future is a tall, gaunt and boney figure (it's Crouchy). He does not speak but merely points at that which he cares to show you. All he will show you is Tiny Jan in an A#senal kit, and Levy furiously masturbating in a olympic size pool full of money.


The next morning you wake up and burst open your windows. 
""Boy, what day is it?"" you ask.

""Sir, today is August 31st, 2013. It's transfer deadline day!"" 

You begin to weep happily and dance.

""There's still time!""

That's why I like Moffat in that sense. Yeah, perhaps he doesn't focus on character emotions as much as RTD did, but he fits them much better into the narrative, in my opinion. I'd rather take mild character emotion/development that weaves itself into the overall narrative rather than strong character emotion/development that is done at the expense of the narrative.",0,1374882414,null,0,false,0,cbb2gei,t3_1j3s2d,t1_cbb2gei,t1_cbb1l2d,null,1430322604,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Have they? Really? Because their article states absolutely no sources whatsoever other than a vague reference to a 'talk' with 'ISPs'. I had come to expect better from ORG, especially given their brilliant coverage of Tempora and PRISM.

As for being related to GCHQ... your assumption is well founded based on the disappointment no doubt felt by the failure of the Data Communications Bill, and the revelations of the external spying programmes. A common ISP complaint was the cost of the implementation, and having half the system already in place would go some way to mitigating that complaint.

However. At present there is nothing to state how the system is to be implemented, and specifically, how deep the ISP needs to go to filter your data. Some may opt, for example, to use DNS based blocks. Some may go for IP blocks, some may go for DPI and look for keywords in your packet data, etc. The point is, at present, there is nothing to state either-way. That would mean that a future inspection programme would find it very difficult to merge all the differing implementations. Hell, at moment there is nothing to state they must do anything at all other than Default to On and offer a 'ActiveChoice'. My implementation is you can disconnect your entire userbase, offer them the choice, and if they choose Yes filter please, tell them to use a different provider - if the ISP feels that particular way about it.

And plenty of people had to pay a lot more than I did to get there, but they did it. 

You dont see me complaining about not getting the Doctor Who experience even though that would cost me a significant amount of time and money. But you don't seem to find that much of a problem. That's just *how it is* and if I want to see it, *I have to make the effort.* It's no one elses fault that you couldn't come to Comic Con, just like it's no one elses fault that I can't visit the Experience or the Proms yet. 

I've been wanting/trying to go for years but couldn't due to time or money or other circumstances. I don't go around blaming studios for my own inability. I saved up and planned for a very long time to make it happen. 

The only reason Comic Con gets it and other places don't is simply because of how big and popular it is. People make the effort from *all over the world* (not just americans) to come to it. There were plenty of people from the UK in that room. If London had a convention as big as Comic Con I'm sure they'd have a bigger industry presence, too. But right now, Comic Con is *the* entertainment convention. Of course the BBC wants a bigger presence there than anywhere else.

Besides, doesn't London Comic Con not happen until October? How do you know they wont show anything that I wont get to see? If that happens, should I message you and tell you how hard life is for me? Should I write a complaint to the BBC because I'm a fan too?

true,rydleo,null,null,"Figured that'd be the reaction, so let me explain:

1) Suarez, in my opinion, is not as good as most on here think.  

2)  If he could single-handledly lift a club into the CL spots, why aren't we there?  Before Suarez: 7th.  With Suarez: 7th.  We've pretty much not improved at all since he came, at least in terms of league position.  Going back further:  Ajax with Suarez:  3rd and out of CL.  After selling Suarez:  1st every year.  All a coincidence?  Perhaps, but I don't really think so.

3)  Suarez led the league in shots (at well over 200 of them) yet made only ~11% (which is pretty poor compared to say Van Persie and well behind Sturridge, but a huge improvement over the previous seasons absolutely woeful 5% hit rate).  I truly believe if Sturridge gets off 200+ shots he'll have well, well more than 23 league goals.  If Suarez were at Arsenal, they don't take many shots normally (Suarez had almost as many per game as  Cazorla and Giroud combined).  I don't see him changing, so I think he would frustrate his teammates (particularly the likes of Walcott who would now be playing wide and rarely see the ball).  

4)  Possession.  Arsenal led the league in possession last season and arguably it's a cornerstone of their play.  Suarez was second highest in terms of turnover out of everyone in the PL at 2.4 times per game (and also the 12th worst in this metric out of all of Europe).  Simply put, Suarez does stupid things with the ball that cost his team possession and this isn't the Arsenal way (nor the Liverpool way for that matter).  Again, frustration from his teammates and his manager would mount at his wastefulness. 

5)  If Arsenal don't buy Suarez they will still buy someone and that person will likely be cheaper than Suarez leaving them with more money to spend on other targets (which arguably I think they need even more than a striker).  Added to which Suarez isn't able to play for ~10-15% of next season guaranteed and some other target would not have that same restriction.

6)  Suarez has been banned for 20 out of 77 games with Liverpool.  Does anyone honestly think he'll clean up his act at Arsenal?  I don't and I suspect his next ban for whatever stupid thing he does will be even longer than 10 games as the FA are tired of his antics and have already made that pretty clear.  A nice lengthy ban at Arsenal would be hilarious to me, but probably less so to Arsene.  No guarantee it would happen, but his track record indicates it well could and it is a huge risk whoever buys him will have to deal with.

7)  This one is more for me, but I'd love to watch Arsenal be booed everywhere they go and constantly be in the press for some stupid stunt Suarez has pulled.

8)  More of a general statement rather than Arsenal specific, but our win percentage without Suarez last season was 85% compared to 37% with.  Overall, it's 62% without him and 39% with.  If we took away every single goal Suarez had last season we fall down a whole spot to 8th (extremely hypothetical, but shows that Suarez had an impact on our GD but much less so on our league position).  Point of this one is I'm not concerned about what Suarez might do for others since we can't control what they do anyway (they will strengthen and it's not at all a case of Suarez or bust), I'm much more concerned about how we play without him and at least where we've had to we don't look half bad.  

So, to sum up, I don't think Suarez fits Arsenal's style of play (at all) and I don't think he would honestly make them any stronger than any other decent striker they'd pick up for 25M+.  I would go so far as to he would probably even make them weaker than an alternative cheaper target might and for the life of me I can't see why they would possibly want him.",0,1374891087,null,0,false,0,cbb533t,t3_1j4cjd,t1_cbb533t,t1_cbb3dkf,null,1430321352,10,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,10

All Moffat said was that the BBC would probably have to decide on a gender before doing a casting call, which isn't completely unreasonable. I imagine it would be pretty difficult to compare male and female actors, especially because a female actor would be so different from what the show has done before.

That said, I don't think we'll be getting a female Doctor this time. I'm not sure how I feel about a female Doctor, but I like the idea that it COULD be a woman someday.

true,swertsta,null,null,"&gt;The season was not for me, it was for others.
&gt;
&gt;Chelsea wins the FA Cup but I don’t play the semi-final nor the final. I didn’t taste anything.
&gt;
&gt;I feel I participated a bit more in the Champions League but even so it was not the Champions League I wanted to win, not like that. I want to win another Champions League and in a different way.
&gt;
&gt;The fans helped me a lot — and you don’t understand why.
&gt;
&gt;You come from outside and you have played well in this league and, with the Spanish mentality, the first who should have turned against you are the fans. You are not living up to expectations but they still support you. These people are special.
&gt;
&gt;At times I was thinking, ‘I will sit here on the bench, I won’t make any noise, I don’t even want to play.’ But they are demanding that you jump on the pitch and play. They lifted my spirits so many times. Not even my team-mates succeeded in doing that in this way. Whatever I do from now on will be for the fans.
&gt;
&gt;That is why I want to win another Champions League. For them.
&gt;
&gt;I lived things that had not happened to me before. A new manager came in and he was hardly counting on you and what you did in training didn’t count either.
&gt;
&gt;You can’t do anything more but you’re not playing. People encourage you whether you play or not but I didn’t know what to do.
&gt;
&gt;I counted on the support of team-mates that are on the bench, who don’t let themselves sink and always give an example.
&gt;
&gt;Paulo Ferreira, the substitute keepers, the youngsters whose progression has stopped. It helped me to see the panorama sitting on the last step.
&gt;
&gt;You can think ‘Maybe Chelsea was not the team’. But if you are a great player, you have to find your place, I’m not the first one to whom this has happened.
&gt;
&gt;I think I didn’t know how to be a point of reference there. And that is what I am trying to achieve. I am obliged to succeed in making my team-mates need me. When you arrive at a club like this, what you had done up to that point means nothing.
&gt;
&gt;It’s not a question of whether they welcomed me or not it’s the fact you are just one more player. It’s not a team or a club where they look at the details — your gestures, how you train, how you behave.
&gt;
&gt;No, you arrive there and you are one more of the team. You only have to be a star on the pitch.
&gt;
&gt;They are veterans and they don’t have to give an example. If I arrived now again for the first time, I would do things differently.
&gt;
&gt;I would try to be one more of the team and adapt to the situation. Now I know that from the first day you have to think of yourself more and try to demonstrate to your team-mates that you are one more of them.
&gt;
&gt;I was paying attention more to what was my place rather than worrying about earning a place.” - See more at: http://www.chelseadaft.org/2012/08/torres-it-was-not-champions-league-i.html#sthash.NrtOAjAF.dpuf

As for Toure, you're right. His pace is worrying. But remember Sterling killed him when he was playing RB. As a CB he shouldn't be run at as often, and hopefully we can play better defense through possession this year.
