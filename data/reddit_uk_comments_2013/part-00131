* Hostile to liberal democracy, socialism, and communism, fascist movements share certain common features, including the veneration of the state, a devotion to a strong leader, and an emphasis on ultranationalism and militarism. 

And again, all these.

&gt; Fascism views political violence, war, and imperialism as a means to achieve national rejuvenation[3][6][7][8] and asserts that stronger nations have the right to obtain land and resources by displacing weaker nations.

Check. What you think of traditional fascism (Hitler, Mussolini, etc) is just monarchy without the biological lineage, all else is roughly the same. There's no meaningful distinction.

[Emilio Gentile describes fascism within ten constituent elements:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism#Definitions)

* a mass movement with multiclass membership in which prevail, among the leaders and the militants, the middle sectors, in large part new to political activity, organized as a party militia, that bases its identity not on social hierarchy or class origin but on a sense of comradeship, believes itself invested with a mission of national regeneration, considers itself in a state of war against political adversaries and aims at conquering a monopoly of political power by using terror, parliamentary politics, and deals with leading groups, to create a new regime that destroys parliamentary democracy;

All mostly relevant, apart from the British monarchy having already destroyed parliamentary democracy at inception. 

* an 'anti-ideological' and pragmatic ideology that proclaims itself antimaterialist, anti-individualist, antiliberal, antidemocratic, anti-Marxist, is populist and anticapitalist in tendency, expresses itself aesthetically more than theoretically by means of a new political style and by myths, rites, and symbols as a lay religion designed to acculturate, socialize, and integrate the faith of the masses with the goal of creating a 'new man';

Teasing out the psychobabble and it's all there*, fascism/monarchy is opposed to the same politics, and yes even capitalism: the queen is too big to fail and there is zero competition. 

* a culture founded on mystical thought and the tragic and activist sense of life conceived of as the manifestation of the will to power, on the myth of youth as artificer of history, and on the exaltation of the militarization of politics as the model of life and collective activity;

Indeed it is founded on mystical thought: Christianity.

* a totalitarian conception of the primacy of politics, conceived of as an integrating experience to carry out the fusion of the individual and the masses in the organic and mystical unity of the nation as an ethnic and moral community, adopting measures of discrimination and persecution against those considered to be outside this community either as enemies of the regime or members of races considered to be inferior or otherwise dangerous for the integrity of the nation;

This goes back to my main point about white supremacy.

* a civil ethic founded on total dedication to the national community, on discipline, virility, comradeship, and the warrior spirit;

Sounds like the rationale behind the queens speech and all that military pomp.

* a single state party that has the task of providing for the armed defense of the regime, selecting its directing cadres, and organizing the masses within the state in a process of permanent mobilization of emotion and faith;

Replace party with family and the pattern is shared, and people's love of the monarch is based on ""emotion and faith"".

* a police apparatus that prevents, controls, and represses dissidence and opposition, even by using organized terror;

Preemptive policing of royal events, etc.

* a political system organized by hierarchy of functions named from the top and crowned by the figure of the 'leader,' invested with a sacred charisma, who commands, directs, and coordinates the activities of the party and the regime;

That could be describing a monarch: ""sacred charisma"".

* corporative organization of the economy that suppresses trade union liberty, broadens the sphere of state intervention, and seeks to achieve, by principles of technocracy and solidarity, the collaboration of the 'productive sectors' under control of the regime, to achieve its goals of power, yet preserving private property and class divisions;

Check. The corporate consolidation of power would be called the crown.

* a foreign policy inspired by the myth of national power and greatness, with the goal of imperialist expansion.

Bear in mind that there's not too much to stop a group of renters doing this themselves to benefit from the savings in various ways. 

E.g. 4 bed house costs £600pw = £150 per room pw. Convert the dining room and it's 5 beds = £120prpw, go all in and include the lounge and it's 6 beds = £100. You just saved £2600 in a year. 

Want to double down? Share a room with a significant other or just go dorm style and make it someone you can tolerate sharing your immediate space with and you've just cut your rent by two thirds. (Now £50pw).

OK, so you've now got potentially 12 people living in what was a 4 bed house so there are other attendant problems like noise, organising paying the bills, neighbours, less space etc. but you are saving a shitload of cash. In this example, over £5K a year. Do this for 4 years and you are saving for a mortgage. 

I totally agree with the general consensus that the housing situation is in need of some evening out but there are a lot of things that vaguely smart people can do to push back against these venal little toe rags who are presiding over things at the moment.

A landlord SHOULD NEVER under ANY circumstance return a deposit before a tenancy has ended and the property is vacated, it's business suicide and a tenant is never going to be able to move into a new place without paying the deposit before the tenancy commences -- unless they have a batshit crazy landlord that allows them to for some batshit crazy reason.",0,1372500170,null,0,false,0,caskc9a,t3_1haqlw,t1_caskc9a,t1_cask9ca,null,1430643045,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Rose would get annoyed at the Doctor and tell him. Martha sulked.
Rose would ask about Timelords but not push, Martha got angry that he didn't tell her anything... forgetting that they have known each other 5 seconds.
Rose screamed, Martha screeched. (god i can't stand her voice)

Also that series of Who was kinda bad anyway. The good eps, IMHO were:
*Gridlock
*Blink

(a side note. some people may point to Utopia/Sound Of Drums/Last Of The Timelords but personally i can't stand these episodes. Magic is the solution. grrrrrrr)

The rest of that season was either ruined by its reliance on Martha as a way for us to get the Saxon story or by that fact it was badly written.

And this also comes into play when she appears in the next series. The Sontaran Stratagem/The Poison Sky i really, really liked... other than anything to do with Martha, Doctor's Daughter, Loved it except for Martha.

Lies. First of all your landlord cannot increase the rent monthly. Secondly it has been widely reported that outside of London, rents aren't increasing.

Mine went up last year. I could remortgage to get lower ones but the £2000 fees would negate any savings.

BTW I rent a house out for just £40 a month more than it'd cost to pay the mortgage on it if you bought it. For that £40 a month the tenant gets all repairs done and an annual gas safety check and boiler/fire serviced.

true,Galerath,null,null,"So I want to offer a different perspective here. I am a landlord (although I don't have hundreds of properties, just one), and while I don't want to make any excuses for ""slumlords"", there are a number of reasons that things are going the way they are. 

Firstly, lots of people are becoming landlords because some of us have realised that pensions are effectively a losing game. Properties are long term investments with long term pay outs, and I think by carefully investing my cash I can do better than I would if I gave that money to a large pension fund to lose on the stock market. I have several friends who think the same way.

Secondly lots of us do treat being a landlord seriously, and in the years I've rented I've encountered more professional landlords than slumlords by far. I want you to be happy in my property so you'll stay on and look after the place. Unhappy tenants don't look after properties as well as they should, and they won't stay on. I lose money for any month that my flat is not let, and I don't want to be scrambling round looking for tenants. The net result is it's in my interests for my tenants to be happy, so I want to get issues sorted as quickly as possible. 

Thirdly, living spaces are disappearing because if I don't rent out the living room, my tenants will. Students and really most young people these days don't want a living room, and in order to save money they will sub-let any spare rooms (against the terms of a short assured lease tenancy). Now this is bad for me as a landlord because I *don't have a legal contract with the sub-letting tenant*, so I have no protection from that tenant. And if the sub-letting tenant breaks/steals/damages something my tenant is legally obligated to pay, but they probably won't be happy to do so.

Fourth, part of the reason your rents are rising is people don't seem to know how to look after property. Maybe it's the vanguard of the Baby Boomer's grandchild generation, maybe young adults have always been like this, but seriously, students and young people don't seem to have any sort of practical knowledge. Like you *need to open windows and let the place air out or you get mold*, and *you have to actually clean the bathroom occasionally or you get mold*. I've repeatedly pestered my tenants to air out the damn flat because there's mold growing on the windowsills, but I already know I'm going to have to get the place professionally cleaned before the next tenants move in. I'm considering asking for a larger deposit next year because one months rent just isn't enough protection from the damage that bad tenants can do. And there are a *lot* of bad tenants, perhaps more than bad landlords.

Obviously the housing shortage is making it easier for unscrupulous individuals to turn a quick buck, so my advice to renters is this - when you're looking at the property it's not just about the property itself, it's about the Landlord. Do you trust the landlord to solve issues quickly? Are they approachable? Will they give you their mobile number? If you're using an agency ask them about the landlord, ask if you'll be able to contact the landlord directly (You'll want to because agencies will do fuck all to help you out of office hours). If you're dealing directly with the landlord talk to them! I'll happily chat to a prospective tenant because I want to get to know them a little bit before I turn them loose on my flat! The bottom line is you have to ask yourself ""If the boiler breaks at 3am on a Saturday, do I trust this person to sort it out?""  If bad landlords couldn't get tenants they'd quickly get out of the housing game.

I assume you meant that councils charge tax on UNoccupied properties... 

The problem with people like this in our economy is that money is a representation of production. How much have you made? That's how much you get to spend. People like this, however, are simply taking money out, they haven't produced anything, the property was built by someone else, they just own it. And through the privilege of having more you're saying they should be given even more?  

The rental system, with appropriate controls, is fine. It's not practical to always own the place you live. People making a living off of renting is fine, if someone makes a career out of it then renters benefit from their experience. The problem is that in our system people are allowed to gouge renters for every penny whilst putting very little money back into the property. They can do that because they have control on the rental market, which more people have to use due to the lack of available council property.

&gt;Good hosiery that doesn't cost the earth. Specifically, hold-ups that do what they say on the tin. Yes, I'm looking at you Boots. Luckily I found some amazing ones in TK Maxx the other night, they're as soft as angel's breath AND stay up, but I could only get them in barely black :'(

Ann summers are quite good, but pricey. Although I've umm never tested them during the day. I'm more of a tights girl! Do you find hold ups are better?

&gt;Also, I have really long, whaddya call them, nail beds? So even when I cut my nails back as far as they can go, they still look quite long, which means that I can't get away with wearing some of the funkier colours on the market because they often end up looking quite daft with long nails.

...slightly jealous now! My nails are so soft and peeling at the moment; it's infuriating. Hmm you could look at nail art styles that incorporate the funky colours, e.g. a funky accent nail with a more muted colour on the rest?

&gt;I probably had 15 shades of red at one point. Then I got burgled, and the bastards stole the box they were in. Bye bye YSL, Dior and various £14 a bottle nail varnishes. I think that upset me more than the other £6.5k's worth of stuff they stole.

But interest rates are incredibly low, can't really argue against that. It's the best time to be borrowing money on mortgages than at any time in the last five decades.

I don't think renting is necessarily a bad choice, I rent and I like it. My landlord is extremely professional - I'm treated the same way by her as I am by my dentist or GP. I pay my rent and I know my home is secure no matter what happens.

I would say what is more of a concern, and maybe the real call for a renters alliance - is what bad landlords can get away with. Luckily I've not had too many run ins (though know many who have), but the argument seems to be: ""If you didn't want to get screwed over by your landlord, you should have buckled down and become your own landlord."" We wouldn't say the same thing if a GP or Dentist mistreated you.

Umm definitely for summer, for a start, they alleviate some girl issues from happening. They feel so much nicer, you feel nicer wearing them, and they help fun times :p.

The landlord who owns the majority (over 300 houses across banbury  each with 3-4 converted rooms) is horrific. All of their properties are full currently and they have moved to only rent to people on housing benefit. When a friend was in dire straits and needed a quick place to move to for a couple of weeks they said that it would be best for her to look for somewhere else as all of their properties were filled with druggies and alcoholics.
Accidentally moved next to a bedsit of one of the other slumlords round here once and it was horrific, three people. Two alcoholics and a kid who would invite his friends round to party every night until the early hours. Police round constantly as one of the alkis kept claiming that the kid was trying to get into her bedroom.
So the experience for me is that we are allowing some landlords (not all) to make really obscene profits whilst not even being bothered about the social costs that they are inflicting on the wider community.

true,hexapodium,null,null,"It's a horrible idea because it incentivises under-the-table deals regarding rent controlled property (you have to make subletting illegal or it doesn't work, so sublets go under the table and lack any protection) and is hugely distortionary to the market (a controlled property has a value disparity between tenant and owner, so owners seek cash-in-hand sweeteners when letting the property out and this creates local drops in availability as they hold out for a tenant who can afford to bribe them upfront).

HOWEVER

If rent-control takes the form of social housing (ie publicly-owned) then these problems go away. The state has a very hard time breaking its' own laws in this instance (with eg bribery) and the structure of social housing contracts can make it irrational to risk subletting (the Very Big Stick of being barred from further social tenancies). 

The only losers from a social-housing scheme are low-housing-quality landlords who get outcompeted (or rather, have their profit margins driven to zero because social housing policy considers housing to be a public good and thus doesn't mind turning no profit, or even taking a subsidy) - unfortunately landlords are horribly politically powerful, particularly on a local government level, and central government has heavily disincentivised building new social housing for a whole wealth of reasons.",0,1372505583,null,0,false,0,caskxil,t3_1haqlw,t1_caskxil,t1_casku0f,null,1430642767,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

[In October 2012](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19815051) it was reported gov was cutting funding to shelter charities, which could close 8 shelters offices (which give out advise) in the UK.

&gt;[People who took this at face value](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/johann-hari/johann-hari-welcome-to-cameron-land-1962318.html) were startled by the first act of the Conservatives on assuming power – a crackdown on the homeless. They immediately sold off 12 homeless shelters, handing them to large property developers. The horrified charity Crisis was offered premises by the BBC to house the abandoned in a shelter over the Christmas period at least. The council refused permission. They said the homeless were a ""law and order issue"", and a shelter would attract undesirables to the area. With this in mind, they changed the rules so that the homeless had to ""prove"" to a sceptical bureaucracy that they had nowhere else to go – and if they failed, they were turned away. 


&gt;[Homeless people face being moved outside their local area](http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/may/02/tory-borough-move-homeless-away) into rented accommodation rather than being placed on a waiting list for council housing under plans considered by a flagship Tory borough in the capital, according to leaked documents (pdf) obtained by the Guardian. This thinking extends to planning policy: more than 10,000 homes will be given planning consent in the borough this year, yet not one will be available to the poor on a social rent, even though mayor Boris Johnson's London plan requires a quarter of new developments to be available to those on low wages. The authority admits its policy will ""end the previously assumed link between a homelessness application and a social housing tenancy"". Welfare cuts mean the trickle of homelessness claims in the capital will soon become a flood.

To be fair most of the chief football correspondents at major UK media outlets are the same shade of overly safe and boring (Winter, D Taylor, Kay, McNulty etc). To put it simply I can't think of any of his articles which stood out for the right reasons. My main gripe with him is that doesn't understand modern football, so he just goes after the morality narrative, or wherever he can find conflict. He's completely out of touch with modern football tactics. I just checked a recent match report of his for England vs. Ireland:

&gt;It was that kind of night, although no-one, not even Hodgson, was quibbling that in the age of 4-2-3-1, this looked like 4-4-2.

Except Michael Cox (and others) on twitter that night explained that Hodgson was right (for once). England were 4-2-3-1 in attack and 4-4-2 in defence, like Dortmund. They just were without the ball for too long. That's about as tactical as it gets from Wallace.

He also likes to throw in tangential information to create conflict.

&gt;Hodgson lost Sturridge to what looked like an ankle injury after the half hour. He was carried off just as news of Luis Suarez's interview in Uruguay outlining his openness to a move away from Liverpool filtered through.

Why is that second sentence relevant to an England match report? I can't quite remember if he's correct here or just stringing together two things because of the club connection. 

When it comes to twitter, his live insights into games are so banal it borders on a Henry Winter parody account:

&gt;[Ronaldo among those Real Madrid players wearing trackie top &amp; snood to warm-up. Rafael wearing a t-shirt. First blood to Rafael](https://twitter.com/SamWallaceIndy/status/301771968481488896)

true,ninereeds314,null,null,"&gt; First of all your landlord cannot increase the rent monthly.

Most rents are shorthold, and deliberately kept shorthold by making you sign a renewal every 6 months or year. Probably more the choice of agents and insurance companies than landlords, though. Each renewal is a chance to increase the rent.

In my case, I've been renting a flat for 8 years and 5 months. The rent increased once, from £450pcm to £465pcm.

Renewal fees these days are frequent enough and high enough that they should sometimes be considered hidden rent. In my case, until very recently, I've been renewing every 12 months and paying a fee of £100 each time. Not trivial on benefits, but now I've got a new agent (same landlord as far as I can tell) demanding a £90 fee 5 months into my current 12 month contract, purely because the landlord has moved the management to a different agency.

So my experience largely agrees with what you say - the rent hasn't changed much (hasn't changed at all in 6 years, I think). Agency fees are supposed to have increased, but apart from an illegal demand by my current agent (which they seem unwilling to put in writing) I haven't been affected by that yet.

However, in real terms, rent has increased - at least from the perspective of the tenant. Incomes are down, the cost of essentials is up. The money available to pay rent is down.

&gt; BTW I rent a house out for just £40 a month more than it'd cost to pay the mortgage on it if you bought it. For that £40 a month the tenant gets all repairs done and an annual gas safety check and boiler/fire serviced.

About those annual gas safety checks - I've had one done in the last three years. The boiler was repaired once, but it's at least as old as the 8 1/2 years I've been here. The agents/landlord have took over the back yard that was supposed to be part of what I rent without notice, turning it into a building site first for conversion work next door (in the course of that smashing a ventilation block so mice can get in through the wall), then into a storage area for maintenance equipment etc, then into a rubbish dump for unwanted maintenance supplies, old to let signs, and the stuff that other tenants left behind when they moved out, with the big wooden platform they used to store stuff on left to rot. Now the new agents are insisting this area is my responsibility.

Most maintenance has been my responsibility. The agents painted over the damp once, when they wanted to use my flat for some valuation inspection. There was one boiler repair, as I said, though the boiler is failing again now and that just means I have a lot of cold showers. And one replacement smoke alarm. Trying to keep the mice out of that smashed ventilation block - my problem. I'd replace the taps myself if the valves to shut off the water actually worked. The damp has ruined a fair amount of my property.

Why am I still here? (1) It's better than most landlords/agents/flats around here. (2) Moving means more fees.

There's no law requiring you to be a landlord. You could simply sell that house.

Since the Tories started the council houses sell-off in the 80s, obviously most of those houses have ended up in the hands of private landlords. Ordinary people have ended up having to rent privately instead of from councils. Private landlords are a major reason why house prices are so high, as well as why rents are so high - they may not have changed much in recent years but, as you observe, they are more than a mortgage on the same property. And the bit you didn't emphasise is that these are mostly buy-to-let properties - a get-rich-quick scheme that landlords are currently complaining about because they're not getting rich as promised since the banks screwed up the economy.

If a building lasts even 50 years, there's no reason why a 20 year mortgage should determine the minimum rent. If it makes sense to rent homes for profit at all, economies of scale suggest the landlords shouldn't be people who own one or two extra houses and still have mortgages to pay even for that.

The logical thing for the housing market created by the Tories to do is for it to consolidate so there's a few huge landlords who, when they buy new properties, don't need a mortgage to do it. Who own properties for many decades, so even if they had mortgages to pay that's only for a small part of the life of any particular property. And what happens when consolidation happens on that scale, of course, is why council housing was originally created.

Personally, I think that's part of the long term Tory plan - it'll take time for the consolidation to happen, but eventually most ordinary people will live in slums owned en masse by a few huge-scale profiteering landlords, a lot like Victorian Britain. Putting the proles back in their place, basically.

Of course in the mean time, a lot of the profits from private letting are redirected to big banks and insurance companies anyway, with lots of estate agents of course grabbing what they can too. As a small landlord, you take a lot of risk for relatively small gains for your part in making the poor poorer.

Right, summary of all the Mkhitaryan stuff from the last 16 hours or so…
After numerous hints on his Twitter page, @arturpetrosyan wrote an article that stated Liverpool had agreed a deal with Shakhtar to take Mkhitaryan to Liverpool. Artur claims that he will have his medical in the next few days, and that the fee is around £25m. Article here:
http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&amp;amp;sl=ru&amp;amp;tl=en&amp;amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.sport-express.ru%2F2013-06-28%2F596680%2F
Before that, whilst Atrur was posting several teasers, Neil Jones from the Liverpool Echo tweeted that the club were not going to make an announcement on the signing of Mkhitaryan last night. No denial there!
After the article was unearthed, several other sources began to tweet the news. Evidently, the story broke on ‘the Friday football show’ on Armenian TV. Armen Nikoghosyan is the person who broke the news. @_Harry_D_ described him by saying
‘He is a journalist who has very strong connections in our (The Armenian) football federation, and is 99.9% of the time right.’
This morning, LFCTV commentator John Bradley dropped yet another hint that Henrikh was on his way to Liverpool: https://twitter.com/JackSear/status/350880751132233728. 
The tweet at the top was from this morning. He quickly deleted it.
Since then, a number of other Ukranian and Armenian sources (one being @YaroLFC) have confirmed that a deal has been agreed, and a deal looks likely to be concluded next week.

Having been through the mill with bad tenants in the past the ones I have now are actually renting at lower than the market rate for the area because I don't want to lose them.

[source](http://www.landlordzone.co.uk/hmos.htm)

So regardless of 'standard let' or not, legally you are creating a HMO when renting to 3 or more non-family relatives. This does not mean your property requires a license though. There are other check boxes to tick before it gets more complex.

&gt;**Housing Act 2004 - Section 254**
&gt;
&gt;(1) “ For the purposes of this Act a building or a part of a building is a ” house in multiple occupation 
“ if:
&gt;
a - it meets the conditions in subsection 2 (“the standards test”)
b - it meets conditions in subsection 3 (“ the self contained flat test”)
c - it meets conditions in subsection 4 (“the converted building test”)
d - an HMO declaration is in force in respect of it under section 255
e - it is a converted block of flats to which section 257 applies
&gt;
&gt;**(2) A building meets the standard test if**
&gt;
a - it consists of one or more units of living accommodation not consisting of self contained flats
b - the living accommodation is occupied by persons who do not form a single household 
(section 258)
c - the living accommodation is occupied by those persons as their only or main residence or they are to be treated as so occupying it (section 259)
d - their occupation of the living accommodation constitutes the only use of that dwelling
e - rents are payable or other consideration is to be provided in respect of at least one of 
those persons’ occupation of the living accommodation
f - two or more of the households who occupy the living accommodation share one or more basic amenities or the living accommodation is lacking in one or more basic amenities",0,1372512419,null,0,1372512715,0,caslvg6,t3_1haqlw,t1_caslvg6,t1_caslshy,null,1430642323,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

My point is about how profiling of Islamic terrorist almost always gets reduced down to making guess about peoples faith based on their race. The EDL's official stance may be against Islam (which is stretching it but lets run with it) but they routinely profile people based on their race as being Muslim and as such people, regardless of if they are Muslim or not, are being profiled and discriminated against *because* of their race. 

It's racism in all but name which is one of the main reasons why focusing on Islam has become so attractive for these groups. They can shelter their effective racism behind as ""ya but it's about Islam"" while making presumptions about who that applies to based on race.

In short if we totally ignore it and presume that the EDL are in no way racist *at all* the way they go about being against Islam still largely manifests itself in discrimination of people based on race. To illustrate this I was asking if the EDL were to treat all Irish catholic in the same way Irish people, or people of Irish descent, do you think we'd face the same level of general public harassment in the street based on how people like the EDL can currently treat people they think are muslim in public currently.

If you have crutches, use them, even on a day you feel you may not need to - it is a visual clue to others that you have good cause to be slower, and many people may stop to ask if you need assistance rather than breeze on by. They will also walk around you more clearly to avoid knocking into you and causing instability. On public transport there are dedicated seats for those with walking difficulties, and you will be looked on more sympathetically for using them if you have crutches (rather than the shitty glare I got the other day for using the disabled loo in a restaurant because I've sprained my ankle and couldn't face the two flights of stairs to the regular loos - but I don't have crutches so *surely I'm just lazy*).

Public transport in major cities have facilities to enable people to get on and off the transportation - trams line up neatly with platforms, buses carry ramps, tube station staff have ramps they can unfold to help you cross the gap at older stations and so on. People are usually willing to offer their seat to someone who is readily identifiable as disabled even if they are not occupying a priority seat.

The estimate is around 20% of the population renting right now ...

There are around 16 million people in the 20-40 years old demographic, if we assume a regular distribution of rentals across all age groups (which it's not, it's patently skewed in the 20-40 demographic but I'll let it slide), that's a minimum of 3.2 million people, or 1.6 million ""households"" (assuming 2 people cohabiting) who are renting right now.

The vast majority of those people will already have children, so at the minimum we need a 2 or 3 bedroom house per ""household"".

So we need to build 1.6 million new 2 or 3 bedroom homes ...

The average price of a terrace house (not even a semi, mind you) is 200 grand ! Might seem steep, but when you factor in the cost of finding the land, especially in in-demand areas etc, it's not unrealistic

1.6 million x 200 grand = 3.2 TRILLION quid. So it'll only take 153 years @ 20.8 billion.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"Saying the monarch could abdicate tomorrow to solve all their problems is rather like saying you could solve all your problems by going into the garage and hanging yourself... whilst there is an awkward truth to it, it isn't really a solution at all. If she did that, it also wouldn't solve your issues with monarchy:

* We would still need a monarch without radical constitutional reform... abdication removes the current monarch, not all monarchs. So the Queen would be stepping down and Charles would be moving up - but that doesn't end her privacy problems or his, because she would still be subjected to media scrutiny with no choice in the matter and as the new monarch there would be even more interest in him. 

* Perhaps you think we should go a step further and do away with all monarchy -  become a republic like the USA. BUT... that won't change the fact the royal family still owns vast tracts of the country and the media would be interested in them. I suppose you could strip those assets from them but it would be very difficult... some things like ownership of the undersea contintental shelf where gas reserves are stored is probably something you could take from them. But ownership of the royal estates? That would just be a land grab... if they wanted to use the courts to stop that they'd have a very good chance since they do legally own that land and not least because most of the judiciary would be extremely sympathetic.

My point is, royals are neither celebritys or politicians. They fall into the nebulus group of people who are famous through no fault of their own, due to their important position in public life. Rather like Sir Mervyn King... only with a key difference, King knew when he took the job as governor of the BoE that he would be famous and he had a choice to decline it. The royal family never had that ability. You also have to remember, things might be pretty rosy for the Queen and Prince Charles who effectively head the organisation and have a constitutional role to fulfill... but what about peripheral royals like Princess Eugenie? They have fewer benefits of the privaledge of monarchy and no constitutional role but still the same drawbacks. The papers would eat that girl alive if they had the chance.

I suspect your issue lies more with the concept of monarchy itself than with any notion of their privacy. Personally I have all respect for the Queen, not many people work until they are 87 years old. And while they may be the epitomy of upper class privaledge, as a family they have never declined to put themselves in harms way. Virtually every male member of the family has served in the armed forces, as has the Queen herself.

And where are we talking about playing cards? Sitting out in the sun, no shade, no pool or similar ? Food, transport and entertainment is folded into the Glasto price tag I gave (£450 quid will get you a genuinely good Glastonbury, plenty to eat, drink, drugs if you want them), so the Tuscan holiday needs to provide something of similar benefit, but appropriate for a tuscan holiday. Eating oatcakes at your tent is fine for Glastonbury, but it sitting out all day doing it by the fake statue of Michelangelo's David (because you can't afford to get inside to see the real one) is not a good Italian summer. Its a horrible contrived budget holiday.

You may be right, but I'm intensely sceptical.

Edit to edit:
&gt;edit: last week of september you can get flights and a villa for £180 per person

By the last week of September the weather in Tuscany is in the mid/high teens, and its near enough double the rain you would get in August. Not saying its not an *OK* holiday, but its a fairly poor budget Tuscan holiday. Early September is fine: slightly cooler, but still hot and sunny.

If you've want to do a budget Glasto you can do it for around £235, including booze.  My point was you won't get a decent Tuscany holiday for a decent Glasto. Given that a budget Glasto has a lot over trying to go to Tuscany under similar conditions (continuous entertainment at the festival as opposed to...well nothing for free in your isolated villa where it's raining because you went at the start of Autumn)

The interaction between John Luther and Alice Morgan is surely one of the most interesting I've ever seen. Plus, there are plans to make it a movie which I think will not be hard since both Idris Elba and Ruth Wilson are rising stars. They won't be interested in acting for a series anymore but a film? Definitely their league. 

P/S: For fans of Luther, join [r/BBCLuther] (http://www.reddit.com/r/BBCLuther) for discussion on this new series that will premier this week.

true,Rozo-D,mccoy,McCoy,"Alright stay with me here, I will try to explain this as best as I can without confusing you too much.  It will confuse you though so I apologize.

Skaro was not destroyed nor was it placed in a time lock.  It was ""devastated"" during the last great time war.  It still existed but there wasn't much, if any, life on the planet.  Thus no real reason to time lock the planet as the Doctor assumed that all the Daleks were dead.  The pesky thing about Daleks is, like the doctor, they can travel through time too so it's hard to figure out if one is dead or not.  They also can repopulate themselves fairly easily.  

The Progenitor Daleks (the rainbow power ranger ones) returned to Skaro and rebuilt the Dalek Emperor, the city of Kaalann (the Dalek capital city) and eventually the entire empire again.  Thus the reason the Daleks seemed to be back in full force when they kidnapped the Doctor, Amy, and Rory to go to the Asylum. 

The Daleks have had asylums for awhile.  The 4th Doctor in ""Destiny of the Daleks"" mentions that he has heard of such places before.  Basically the Daleks don't kill the insane ones because they find something beautiful about them, basically the purest of daleks: pure hatred.  

Now the question will arise ""well that's all well and good the progenitor daleks rebuilt everything but wouldn't all the other daleks share the same color scheme/look"" perhaps.  you'll notice that some of the daleks on the saucer look like the ones from previous series.  Kaalann is said to exist in multiple realities so it's possible that the progenitors simply brought Daleks from different realities/dimensions or hell even timelines since they can do that to the ""present"" timeline.  Remember Skaros was never placed in a timelock and not all the Daleks died.  Most did, but not all.  

As far as why the Doctor isn't that concerned...Well I guess you could say that he's beaten them every other time he's probably to the point now where while the daleks are a huge threat he's not worried that much anymore because he knows he can beat them.  Also remember that at the end the Daleks knowledge of the Doctor is erased.  

Hope that helps a bit.  The thing about Doctor Who is there is A LOT of stories/information outside of the TV Shows that is always taken into account.  Unlike a lot of other sci-fi series that also exist in other mediums Doctor Who does a good job at keeping all this stuff connected.  If you've never read the books or comics or listened to the radio dramas then yeah this episode doesn't make that much sense at all.

Glasto is a good festival. I'm just sitting here watching the Monkey's and I'd absolutely love to be there. A great British act by any means. With appearances from the Moneys, the Stones!!, Mumford and Sons, Primal Sceam, Elvis Costello, Kenny Rodgers, Beady Eye etc. alongside excellent new acts and smaller acts coming through in the smaller tents to chill out to there's no denying it's a fantastic event to be at - if I landed a half decent job and had the opportunity to save up to go once I'd take it so long as it stayed similar to how it is, even to be able to just experience Glastonbury. 

What I will however say is Gastonbury has become, in many ways, an image of the music industry as it is today. It is extortion to a certain extent and the middle class image of it is showing what type of crowds are welcome today - and becoming more mediocre for it. I see it a bit like top level football in England which has gone a similar direction with it's financial interests about the fans.

Unfortunately that's the case with many festivals now but there is still some excellent, affordable and 'bad boy' image that are still out there. The only issue with that is there is now too many and it's getting to the point there is no standout ones amongst them. Read a great article about that recently.

The market rate is the price you can reasonably expect to sell at. If you can't sell, you're not offering to sell at the market price.

If your most recent claim is accurate, you gambled and won - good for you. But if you could ""afford to sell at 1/2"" what you call the market price, despite your claim that ""If I could have sold it I wouldn't be letting it out."", renting rather than selling is a choice you made.

Your tenant still isn't just making you £40 per month better off. Someone who can't afford to buy a home is still paying your mortgage for you, plus a bit more. In time your debt for that house will be paid, and your tenant who paid your mortgage and a bit for however many years will still have nothing to show for it.

BTW - this reads as an attack on you. That's not really the intent. I'm just trying to describe the situation as I see it.

For example, I don't believe you should have done differently, even if you were in the someone-else-paying-your-gambling-debts scenario. People putting themselves at a disadvantage doesn't change the system - that's just one more person beaten down by system and replaced by someone else. The problem isn't individuals acting rationally, at least not ordinary people with no real power to change things. The problem is the bad joke we call democracy.

My father was strongly against the council house sell off, but he didn't waste any time buying his council house. That doesn't mean he's a hypocrite. It just means he's not a moron - the downside of the sell-off was coming no matter what at that point, irrespective of whether he grabbed his share of the up-side or not.

That condensation will accumulate around the windowsills and get into the wood, and cause mold to grow there. This mold can cause damage by growing into the wood, or it can even be unhealthy, like black mold. Dampness itself can also cause damage by weakening building materials, to the extent that ceilings can cave in with a serious damp problem.

It depends where you live (for example Scotland is very damp, but the south of England not so much), but you'll need to occasionally open the windows to dry out the condensation and the windows, and get rid of the damp from the air. It prevents mold and the fresh air is probably good for you too :P

i totally agree. i think it is both short-sighted and sad that the most admirable area of City (youth development) over the last decade is being taken apart like this in favour of a transplanted one. when you combine the lack of real world-class players that have come in since the first rash it doesn't seem that sensible to tear up a decent avenue of free talent to either use or sell in favour of starting again.

i remember when Rafa came in and did the same thing at Liverpool, the difference being that we really had fallen away at the youth level, and needed a rebuild. even as a LFC fan i'm a bit disappointed at the moment with how City have lost out on or just not moved for certain players, but it can still be turned around.

the other thing that bothers me a bit is that there is a real opportunity this summer both with big TV money and the changes at Chelsea/Utd to kick on, and City dithered/got delayed on signing Pellegrini, and haven't done a lot of business yet. it seemed to me that Isco was a big part of his plan for City, and that the loss of that transfer may mean a rethink. is that accurate in your eyes, or are there other targets coming in beside Navas and Fernandinho? also, how do you feel about the price for the latter?",0,1372526423,null,0,false,0,casp6vj,t3_1h3vih,t1_casp6vj,t1_car9m8y,null,1430640759,3,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,3

Okay, I'll bite ... what you mean basically is build more council estates ... because that's always been the typical way of housing ~~poor people~~ people who claim housing allowance.

So people move into those council houses, and then what ? Because the council estates I remember when I was a kid had 3 generations living in them, and they NEVER gave them up. Also, they were generally allowed to fall into disrepair because the tenants had no onus to maintain them, and just waited for the council to do a blanket renovation program, costing even MORE money.

The best thing that happened was allowing people to buy their own council houses, thus taking the pressure off the council in terms of maintenance. But of course, once you've sold a council house to someone, you can't give it to anyone else ... even if it was available, which as I explained above very rarely happened anyway.

So where is your ""stock"" of housing ? There isn't one ... you spend massive amounts of money building council houses using the cheapest bidder and crappy materials, then throw further massive amounts of money at them to maintain them, because sure as hell the tenants won't.

And every new generation also wants a council house, and the cycle continues ... until presumably we run out of money, land, patience, or a combination of all 3, just like in the 80s.",0,1372527037,null,0,false,0,caspd5x,t3_1haqlw,t1_caspd5x,t1_casp5ek,null,1430640606,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

It will obviously benefit the Club long term as the plans for the new Academy are excellent, and we do have some competent guys in the mix there.  However, we have some extremely well liked and highly talented people like Cassell and Power who could relate the social heritage of the Club to the kids.  Soriano identified [in his book](http://www.amazon.com/Goal-Doesnt-Chance-Management-Football/dp/0230355153/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372527254&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ferran+soriano+book) that this was a major part of the Barca academy that had to be kept on.  With Vieira moving into the top role with the EDS, I'm wondering if they're going to forget all of the ""120 years of strive for the people of Manchester"" and concentrate on the ""5 years of excellence"" in imparting this philosophy.  City has always been the Club who was incredibly involved in its community, from schools to charities and everything in between.  It's why we were founded in the first place and something that successive owners have kept afloat, including Sheikh Mansour.  Not imparting all of that hard work onto the new kids would be an opportunity missed in my book and would change the dynamics of the Club.

As far as the transfer race goes, I actually want us to fail to land Cavani, Gomez and the rest.  Because with all of the boasting that Soriano and Bergstain have done about landing transfer targets (capitalising on Marwood's failures last year to land RVP, De Rossi and Hazard), I know that soon they'll start panicking and go after somebody game changing like a Messi, Ronaldo, Bale or Rooney and feel pressure to land them.  Might work out in the end.

The fee for Fernandinho was was it was really.  I do wonder if Marwood's failures and the Barca boastings had something to do with this.  Failure to land a player from Shakter for the sake of £5m or so would have looked extremely bad on the new pair looking to impress Sheikh Mansour and Khaldoon as ""real football men who can get stuff done"".  I don't particularly mind the fee as he's potentially here for 5 years and he's supposed to be both talented and determined to play.

What happens when they get a job and better prospects? Do you then kick them out for no longer being worthy, and force them back into the rental market? Or do you let them stay put for their entire lives, further reducing your ""stock"" for other needy individuals ?

And the age old question, where exactly is the money going to come from, because 20 billion quid is a drop in the ocean for the amount of land you'll need to buy and materials and labor you need to pay.

You just buy your lunch ingredients/booze in the shops and then wander round the city/go to the beach or get on a bus and go out into the countryside.

I agree with you on the fact that I have faith in Brian and his transfer policy. He isn't one to go in all guns blazing and he wants to build a solid team around a philosophy he thinks will work out in the long term.

The championship is a fickle mistress so it's impossible to predict what the season will have in store for us, but optimistically I'm going to say we'll get a play off spot if Brian gets his targets in.

Let's face it, we're not going to win the championship with the current team, and the boar don't look like they're going to pump in any funds soon.

We need to trust Brian and let him craft the club into what he wants, we can't just throw money at players and hope they'll do the job or else we'll just implode like Qpr did.

I also think that Brian wants to focus a lot on our Youth setup , hence why he gave the youth team staff renewed contracts and Redfearn has a first team coaching role too right? And he also wanted to improce the training facilities at Thorp Arch, another hint to improve the squad internally.

Basically I don't think we'll get promotion this season, but we'll do ok and get a play off spot.

Compare this with a lot of American comedies (from what I'm told), the main characters are normally wise cracking cool guys. To an extent this is a bit like the Community, where Jeff is 'better' than everyone else. 

So, we have the IT Crowd being built around these people basically being outcasts and losers, who we grow to love. While I wouldn't say they are ugly, Roy and Jen aren't beautiful supermodels.

You don't seem to be grasping my point which is that removing the royal family from their role as monarch **would not** prevent them from being immensly wealthy... ironically though it **would** entitle them to much greater privacy so if anything seems to be going against your earlier point. Ultimately their wealth is legally owned and ceasing to be a monarch would not change that - nor would it strip them of the things they own. You can make all sorts of arguments about how that wealth was aquired over the past 1000 years but in a court of law, they would win as they do legally own it. You would also be naive to think that the aquisition of their wealth is any more or less 'moral' than that of any other large corporation... lets not forget Coca-Cola became the worlds largest soft drinks retailer by feeding people a noxious mix of illicit drugs. Volkswagens modern wealth is in part owed to their role in helping manufacture the killing wagons that preeceded gas chambers in the Holocaust and Hugo Boss became a major brand by manufacturing the characteristic black uniforms of the SS.

Personally I think that while we should entertain discussions on the merits of monarchy, the personal character of the current Queen is second to none.

Laws can be written any time: thou shalt not own half of Britain whilst any other Briton goes landless.

She has received billions whilst others go homeless. That's obscene, selfish and uncaring.

However, every cynical inch of my body is ringing the 'bullshit alert' bell. So here's what I think has happened:

As with the Rowe situation, Leeds have given Crewe Alex a ring to enquire about Murphy. Perhaps McDermott rang first to sound out his availability and confirm Leeds United's interest, before Harvey followed up to ask about the price. Then, following that, Leeds have naturally not responded since - just like they haven't followed up their interest in Rowe - because they don't have one million pounds to spend on a single player, nor a group of players for that matter.

But because Leeds United expressed an interest, someone at Crewe has probably leaked it to the press to try and drum up further interest.

true,TheGallifreyan,colin-baker,Colin Baker,"I don't mind the questions. I'm somewhat evangelical about classic Who, so get ready for a wall of text and feel free to ask me anything else.

Season 7b had a lot of references to classic Who to celebrate the 50th anniversary. There are very few references outside of those episodes, though many classic monsters have appeared in the new series. 

You don't need to watch in order, mostly. There are only 2 story arcs.

Season 16 (Fourth Doctor) - They are looking for pieces of the key to time across the universe. The main villain of this arc returns in the Season 20 (Fifth Doctor) stories Mawdryn Undead, Terminus and Enlightenment. 

Season 23 - (Sixth Doctor) - The Time Lords put The Doctor on trial. 

Two things before diving in. 
1. Classic Who stories are all pretty much movie length. Each one spans multiple episodes, usually 4 25 minute ones.
2. Sadly, due to BBC junking policy in the 70's most of the first 2 Doctor's stories are missing, especially The Second Doctor's era. All of the audio still exists, though some are in very bad condition. They have recently started animating them, 2 are out already, and 3 more are in the works. You can also find reconstructions online, I find them kind of difficult to watch. 

Onto the suggestions.  

First Doctor
An Unearthly Child - The first episode is the only one I'm suggesting, the rest are their own story. This is the first episode of the show.
The Daleks - First Dalek episode.
The Aztcs
The Dalek Invasion of Earth - Susan's departure.
The Time Meddler - First other appearance of another Time Lord.
The Dalek's Master Plan - 12 parts, mostly missing so it is a tough watch, but there is not a lot of hope for an animated release due to the amount of missing episodes. Never the less, If you only watch one recon (and I suggest you do just that) make it this.
The Tenth Plant  - Regeneration. First Cybermen episode. Episode 4 is missing. They are releasing an animated version in November, but since only one episode is missing, the recon is watchable. They even have video of the regeneration itself in the recon.

Second Doctor
The Tomb of the Cybermen - Generally considered one of the best Who story ever.
The Ice Warriors - Animated version releasing in August.
The Mind Robber
The Seeds of Death
The War Games - 10 episodes. Regeneration. First appearance of the Time Lords.

Third Doctor - Rather than list most of his episodes, I'll list the best ones, but I recommend all of it. The first 3 seasons are unique in the series because he is trapped on Earth and working as scientific advisor to UNIT.
Spearhead from Space - His first episode.
Terror of the Autons - First appearance of The Master, he appears in every episode this season.
The Curse of Peladon
The Three Doctors - My favorite classic story. The chemistry between the Second and Third Doctors is must see. 10th anniversary special.
Carnival of Monsters
The Time Warrior - First appearance of Sarah Jane Smith, only classic companion to appear in the new series.
The Monster of Peladon

Fourth Doctor - Again I suggest pretty much all of his era, but here are some of best.
Robot - His first episode.
Genesis of the Daleks - Generally considered  one of the best Who story ever.
Terror of the Zygons
The Deadly Assassin - Major Time Lord episode.
The Sun Makers - My favorite Fourth Doctor story.
Underworld - Important to the Time Lords, even though they do not appear.
City of Death - Generally considered one of the best Who story ever.

*Note* The Fifth, Sixth, Seven, and Eighth Doctors are much shorter than previous Doctors. If you want more of them, I highly recommend their Big Finish audios.

Fifth Doctor
Castrovalva - His first episode.
Mawdryn Undead - My favorite Fifth Doctor story. Very complicated. I feel like it is important to the Time Lords, even though they do not appear.
The Five Doctors - Major Time Lord episode. 25th anniversary special.
The Caves of Androzani - Regeneration. Generally considered  one of the best Who story ever.

Sixth Doctor - A lot of the writing for is not really up to par with the rest of the series, especially in the first season due to a lot of behind the scenes stuff. Leading to the BBC demand they regenerate him due to low ratings. I blame none of the problems with this era on Colin Baker, I think he played what was written brilliantly. If you're interested, [here is a video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUF5EAw63zk)
Vengeance on Varos
Season 23 - A four story season in which The Doctor is placed on trial. Possibly important to the 50th anniversary.

Seventh Doctor
Silver Nemesis
Ghost Light

I'd also give this girl that I know 50k, and then take her and her son travelling to wherever they want to go for a bit. Disneyland included obviously.

I'd also get wankered with my mates who are currently enjoying themselves up in Liverpool without me, celebrating my mate Jack's 2.1 (I got a 2.1 too but I'm working tomorrow.)

I guess the flat (100k) and house (300k) are the biggest purchases I'd have. Other than that i'd be spending the time that the money allows me to have, rather than the money itself I think.

I'd read every single backlogged book I've got (about 200 of them right now)

Really take the time to pursue any and all interests I have (guitar, DIY, etc) - without having stuff like work distract me/keep me busy.

I'd still work too, something in community arts or applied theatre, which is another thing the money gives me time to do without worrying about getting a steady income from it.


Not sure what else, seems like I'm a bit of a boring bastard in that regard.

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"Robinson is doing his charity walk, lots of police about.

Someone approaches the walk, punches one of Robinson's mates and walks off.

EDIT: The bloke who punched Robinson's mate was actually having a conservation with Robinson about the walk. Robinson's mate pushes the bloke violently in the back, so the bloke turns around and hits him.

Police stop Robinson (they're getting near the mosque), and try to talk to him. Robinson starts going on about arresting the bloke who punched his mate, interrupting the officer for a good minute and a half. 


Officer finally talks, saying she's arresting him for stopping officers breaching the peace. She claims they have said multiple times that Robinson and Co. should stop and negotiate the walk, because he'd get arrested if he goes near the mosque. Robinson claims that there was no such offer of negotiation, and he was never told he would be arrested if he got near the mosque.

Robinson and Co. complain that they are being arrested for no reason, and it is even worse because they are doing the walk for a dying child on armed forces day. 

Robinson claims that the officers are in fact enforcing Sharia Law.

Robinson gets handcuffed, claims he's done nothing wrong, and that the man who punched Robinson's friend should be arrested. He wants to finish his charity walk, on arms forces day of all days. Robinson's friend also handcuffed.

tl;dr Robinson thinks the fact that he is doing a charity walk on arms forces day puts him above the law.

Rents are very affordable in these areas.

Both of these patches are in South Birmingham. You will almost invariably save money living in North Birmingham (Handsworth Wood, Hamstead, Great Barr, Erdington etc etc).

You can also save money by living a little further out, but on one of the arterial train routes or the metro (tram) route, as long as you're happy to take public transport to work.

*Obstructing a Police Officer - section 89(2) Police Act 1996
The offence of obstructing a police officer is committed when a person:

wilfully obstructs
a constable in the execution of his duty, or
a person assisting a constable in the execution of the constable's duty.
It is a summary only offence carrying a maximum penalty of one month's imprisonment and/or a level 3 fine.

A person obstructs a constable if he prevents him from carrying out his duties or makes it more difficult for him to do so.

The obstruction must be 'wilful', meaning the accused must act (or refuse to act) deliberately, knowing and intending his act will obstruct the constable: Lunt v DPP [1993] Crim.L.R. 534. The motive for the act is irrelevant.

Many instances of obstruction relate to a physical and violent obstruction of an officer in, for example, a public order or arrest situation. This standard only deals with conduct which can amount to an obstruction in the context of an interference with public justice.*

Any rational person can see that they did not obstruct the police, or prevent them from doing their duty, or intend to do so. The police's primary duty in that scenario was to arrest the man that assaulted the EDL member for assault. They weren't obstructing this duty, but were in fact supporting this action.

It is clear that the two men that were walking with the EDL on their march were behaving unnecessarirly antagonistically to try to proke the EDL members into breaking the law, by standing ridiculously close to them, walking slowly as possible in front of them and possibly elbowing one of them.

Whether they were anti-fascists or police agent provacateurs, it is clear that they were determined that the EDL could not finish their march past a mosque - the same objective that the police had. It seems to me all too convenient that the EDL members were attacked just before the spot where the police chief had apparently arbitrairily decided that they could not walk past.

If you're in a fixed-term tenancy the landlord cannot raise the rent without your approval, you can deny a rent increase if you want.

If you're in a periodic tenancy they can only increase the rent once per year and the rent increase must be fair. If the rent increase amount isn't fair [you should contact the rent assessment committee](https://www.gov.uk/housing-tribunals/rent-assessment-committee-disputes-about-rent). 

Also it's worth contacting your landlord directly, your contract is with them, not the letting agent, they're just an *agent*. If you think this increase is going to push you into terminating your rental agreement explain this to your landlord and it's very likely they'll agree to keep the rent as is. If your rent is £1000 per month and the increase is £50 and that forces you to leave and it takes them one month to find a new tenant... that means they'll have lost £1k, which is 20x the rent increase amount!

The obstruction comes when they stated that unless they were arrested, they would be marching past the mosque. The Police would have made provisions and resourced units based on what the EDL would have planned following the application to march. 

By not following that application, they are preventing the officers from carrying out their duties and are making it more difficult to do so.

The good news is its close to the main transport hubs of New St station and Col more Row / Broad St itself for buses.

Ladywood is close and cheap but has a bit of a rough reputation, (in between Edgbaston and the city centre) so you could walk to work. Broad Street will also be closed to road traffic for six weeks soon as part of refurbishing the tunnels and a pilot for seeing abut extending the metro down there. Other alternative s are Hockley and Nechells if you want to stay close to the centre. Hockley is going through a bit of a revival as its next to the jewellery quarter so I'm not sure if you could be I your budget on that one. Otherwise as previously discussed Quinton and Bearwood are also good. 

Longbridge is also cheapish at the minute and you could catch the train to 5 ways (will be a ten minute walk from the train station to work for you), its currently also going through a big change with the regeneration of the old Longbridge factory. Other places on the line you could consider are Northfield and Selly Oak  (Selly Oak is the student centre of town so cheap rents but not sure if you could get a house. 

Best of luck to you and hope you enjoy your new life in Birmingham. The city is going through quite a period of change at the moment and things are looking brighter.

Of all the CBs we've been linked with I'm still most keen for Papa. Alderweireld seems too stylistically similar to Agger. We need an enforcer and out and out leader. Thats Pap. 

Rodgers clearly understands this as he keeps talking about mentality. Aspas is a perfect example of a fighter. We haven't had enough of them for years. You need a few around the pitch to turn those stalemates on their heads.

This is the edition of the book I am using (my pal picked it up at a con last year), although it would seem that a new version with updated monsters/villains/aliens from the Matt Smith era was released last year.  

Here is a free flash version of the character creator for the version I am using (has automatic music, sorry): http://dwcg.eu5.org/

This system is pretty simple, so it shouldn't be too hard to learn, but I would advise you finding an experienced GM to run it, since you have never played a tabletop before.  Tabletop is its own world of gaming, with a lot of quirks and special terminology and such.  Once you start playing, you catch on pretty quickly, but it can be intimidating at first.  Also, it might be easier to see if you can join a local D&amp;D game to get a hang of things first, before trying to get together a group to do a DW game.  It's a lot of fun!

Henrik is a target with potential, he has performed well on the international stage as well as with Shaktar, his goal against Denmark showed talent. 11 goals in 39 games for Armenia also shows that it is not uncommon for him to score against big national teams. He was the top goalscorer in his Euro 2012 qualifying Group, which landed him in the dream team for the qualifying stage. And any player who shows a talent to score in his local league and internationally will command a premium price.

IF Henrik is a real target, not just something instigated by the press, then I believe there is a plan for him and the team as a whole. Rodgers has so far been pretty specific in his signings and so far he has had a pretty good record. BUT, he has not signed anyone in this price range.

Serious medical need can be interpreted in a lot of ways. What if you're not in immediate pain but are showing symptoms of an illness? What if you need surgery?

Upon registering the council will offer a better route or more appropriate route. This time, Robinson wanted to march through Tower Hamlets by a mosque. Because intel, previous incidents suggest that tensions are high the council/police refused and offered better suggestions for a route with less chance of any disorder occurring. Robinson denied that and insisted he wanted to march specifically passed the mosque. Now don't get me wrong, I'm all for freedom of speech and expression, but Robinson is little more than a vile football thug. 

I refuse to take Robinsons word for anything, there's bound to be intel or information we aren't privvy to by the police. 

However, I can agree that this arrest is barely justified in my eyes, the Inspector that arrested him probably could do better in describing why, and I can understand her reasoning, however I suppose her reasoning comes down to Robinson purposefully insisted on defying an order from senior police officers not to march past the mosque, with him doing so he is obstructing a police officer (the senior officers).

true,Kesuke,null,null,"I'm pretty sure this will almost certainly prove unworkable, since the NHS doesn't have a mechanism in place to a) identify those people that aren't actually elligible and b) come up with a realistic amount to charge them. It also isn't in the ethos of most GPs to deny care to people - ironically even those that aren't actually eligible for NHS care. My guess is most GPs will fail to enforce these rules because that is the easiest thing from their perspective. After all, this would rely on GPs flagging up people who are not eligible and charging them... well if they just keep their mouth shut then they'll still get paid, their patients will still get treatment and it will cut out a lot of administrative trouble for them.

The other problem is, if someone is non-UK domiciled and payment is retrospective (i.e. you go see the GP and THEN get posted a bill, which is probably the only way of doing this) then they are going to be intrinsically difficult to track down and force to pay, since they can easily run back to their non-EU home nation to avoid paying. 
 
The other issue (although there are workarounds for this) is that unlike in the USA, France, Germany etc. where insurance makes up a portion of treatment costs, the UK does not have a very evolved cost-model -- What I mean is, when you go see your GP for the flu - there is no 'cost' associated with it. Instead the GP gets paid a huge amount of money to provide a vast range of services, of which seeing people with the flu is one tiny tiny part. So it is going to be very difficult for them to go *""Right then, one consultation for the flu, a blood test and a packet of penicillin... that adds up to £164.35 please""*. In the USA by contrast there are fixed rates for consultations, drugs, investigations, and even tea/coffee in the waiting room.

Then you set up a partly private company where foreign residence must register and pay upfront a nominal fee (deposit) to be entitled to non emergency healthcare, before entering the country, if they dont they get no healthcare.

we don't owe people free healthcare what ever administration is needed to bill the non entitled should be done also to the non entitled.

Potentially it would familiarise GPs with costing-up individual services, which is something most are unfamiliar with in this country. It is also possible that once GPs become more comfortable doing that sort of costing, they would be prepared to extend it further to other groups of patients for other services. 

The only curiosity though is that health-tourism is more of a problem for hospitals than GPs (as by their nature hospitals are vulnerable to someone getting on a plane knowing they have gallstones - flying to the UK and turning up at A&amp;E where staff are none the wiser). It is also more likely that privatisation will occur through the hosptials rather than the GP (i.e. NHS hospitals will slowly be displaced by the 'any qualified provider' model. Same doctors - but with a different private employer).

That would tend to support my view of this government on the NHS... they deeply want privatisation but have accepted that it will not be fully realised under their command, and so have opted instead to lay the foundations for a baby-step process towards privatisation.",0,1372589856,null,0,false,0,cat41j0,t3_1hcsvy,t1_cat41j0,t1_cat3u28,null,1430633678,20,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,20

&gt;You are covered with your EHIC in Germany; however you may be asked to pay for your treatment in advance and then seek a refund back in the UK. A standard fee of €10 is to be paid upfront, and often in cash only, for almost all German health services. This is non-refundable in Germany but, again, you may seek reimbursement in the UK.  
  
[In France:](http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/Healthcareabroad/countryguide/Pages/healthcareinFrance.aspx)
&gt;You must pay the doctor directly. The doctor then will fill out a treatment form (feuille de soins) and a prescription if necessary. The treatment form is necessary  to claim any refunds. You can claim back around 70% of the standard treatment cost. The standard rate for a consultation with a general practitioner is 21 Euros and 25 Euros for a consultation with a specialist. These charges are non-refundable in France but you may be able to seek reimbursement when you are back in the UK.

* Congestion: First has only ever been anything approaching full for me once, about 3pm midweek. Otherwise it's been empty enough to get a table of four to yourself or to look out of the window. The TMs don't seem to care if you're not sitting in your reserved seat as long as you're on the right service.

* Seating: The seats are wider and I find the blue more relaxing than the red of standard. Legroom is better but honestly not that much better - the lack of congestion means you can always stretch out onto the next seat. IIRC they have power sockets at every seat but they do at table seats for sure.

* 1st Lounges: Haven't been in the one at BHM since it was refurbished so no comment there. The one at Euston is pretty good especially if you need to get some work done. Soft drinks, hot drinks and snacks/fruit are complimentary and there doesn't seem to be a limit on them but don't take the piss or they may introduce one. Alcohol is available at Euston and it's a decent selection at decent prices (especially for a station). They're good if you arrive early and don't fancy standing around. I've heard a rumour of some people buying BHM-BHI 1st tickets just to use the lounge, how true this is I couldn't say

* Food: A lottery depending on what the menu is on the day. Some services there are only snacks and drinks available. The food is good but if you want something really nice/different get food before/after the journey.

 * Breakfast^1 : I had the full English albeit without the egg because I don't like them. It was definitely tasty and the orange juice that went with it was nice. No booze at breakfast!

 * Snacks: Crisps/Fruit the last time I went. The fruit is your standard stuff albeit tasty. Crisps were Tyrell's. I usually get offered snacks twice

 * Dinner: Only ever had it once and that was a few years ago. It was a jacket potato with baked beans and a sachet of butter on the side. Delicious and comparable to what I'd get at home.

* Drinks : Very good, reckon you'll get 2/3 offers depending on length of journey and the time of day. Both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks are available. Expect to get more tea/coffee the later in the day it is.

It wasn't even a charity walk. They have no support from the girl, her family, or her charity, who have, along with Help for Heroes, refused donations from the EDL and Robinson. They are just using her as a political pawn, and a reason to do the march, shown by the amount of times they said it was an outrage they were being stopped because they were doing this fake charity walk. Are you telling me a nice, reasonable person would do that, use a dying child as a political pawn to stick one at them Muslims? Rubbish.

&gt;bullshit charge

No, it wasn't a bullshit charge. They were obstructing an officer from doing their duty by ignoring what they were saying. Judging by what the officer said (as I pointed out in my first post), Robinson ignored the officers multiple times when told to stop, and finally gets lairy when they are apprehended.

So, am I allowed to go on a fake charity walk, and use it as an excuse to ignore police officers and cry that they are enacting Sharia law?

&gt;And yet when Choudary screams behead all British soldiers at Army parades he is not only not arrested, but protected by the same Police.

Two wrongs don't make a right. But, from what I understand, Choudary is doing legal protests, so the police can't arrest them, whereas what the EDL were doing here wasn't sanctioned by the police.

true,saviourman,null,null,"I actually stewarded at Bestival last year as well. In both cases the shifts are spread over 24 hours, so you have one shift from 6:00 - 14:00, one from 14:00 - 22:00 and one from 22:00 - 6:00. The overnight one is a bit rough if it's hot weather because you won't be able to sleep in your tent during the day, unless you leave your tent ""door"" thing open. 

The shifts are fine really though. One of mine was next to a stage and some dubstep guy was on, so that was alright. I just had to stand in the tent and make sure no one was dying or lost. My other two were ""caravan-site patrol"" where I walked around the campsite to make sure nothing ""bad"" had happened. (Actually one time something bad did happen, some sort of domestic dispute. We arrived to start our shift, and one of the stewards from the shift before was crying, and there were police everywhere. No idea what happened though.) For the boring shifts I recommend you bring a fold-up chair if you can get away with it. For me, it was pretty unlikely anything was going to happen in the caravan site between 22:00 and 6:00 so we just sat around most of the time and watched the sunrise. (It does get cold on the overnight shifts so bring some jumpers/whatever.)

You can swap shifts with people if you particularly want to see one band or whatever. There's a big board where you put your name down to switch. Might mean you end up with two night shifts or something but it's up to you. 

There are showers at Bestival (in the steward's camping area) which is pretty nice. There's usually queues though, so you just have to go at weird times (i.e. late at night/early morning). 

Also check out the staff bar, last year it was near the tree thing (I don't know what it's called, it's basically a hollowed out fake tree with a DJ inside). The staff bar is open later than the others and I think it was slightly cheaper too. You're allowed in as a steward. 

Can't really think of much else. Other than the shifts, it's pretty much standard festival fare. Obviously you can't get quite as wrecked as a punter if you're going on shift, but that's basically it.

Sorry for the wall of text. I think I pretty much just rambled, but whatever. Have a good time :)

Edit: One other thing, there are plug sockets for you to charge your phone in a big tent in the steward's campsite, so bring your charger. You might have to sit in the tent with it if you think it might get stolen, but there's a bar and free tea there so you can just bring a pack of cards or something.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"&gt; You do realise that GP surgeries already charge for EVERYTHING they do.

While you are right to say things are costed up, they are not costed up the way you think they are -- The cost of each individual patients treatment is **not** known by either the GP or by the PCT. Instead costings are done on a much larger scale based on more complex factors like the number and demographics of the registered patients, past performance of the surgery and the services they offer. The GP **does not** simply pass a bill on for:

&gt; 1 x 30 minute consultation at £100/hour = £50

&gt; 1 x 7 day course of penicllin 500mg at £4.55

&gt; 1 x Full blood count at £27.45 + £2 P&amp;P

&gt; **Sub total**: £82

One of the only times where that kind of costing **IS** done, are for things like vaccinations as per your example.

To give you an example of how costings are done, imagine this: a 65 year old turns up at the GP with a diabetic foot ulcer that needs antibiotics, some blood tests and bandaging by the practice nurse. This is bread and butter stuff for GPs.

Now, the GP recieves a budget from the PCT (and by extension the NHS/DH) to treat all their patients who have diabetes. But this is where it gets complicated... most people with diabetes have multiple complex health problems - like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, fatty liver disease, obesity, visual and sensory impairments etc. Although he needs bandaging and antibiotics, he has developed a foot ulcer because his diabetes is not under control... so that will also need addressing adding further indirect costs. Next, the GP will also recieve cash to reduce things like high blood pressure and cholesterol that the patient almost certainly also needs. How they spend that money is up to them though... What happens is all these many pots of cash are basically combined and then just split up between paying for the practice nurse, the blood tests, scans, the GPs salary, the receptionists, the insurance on the surgery, building maintainance and improvements, electricity, water, IT etc. There is no single itemised breakdown per patient of costs done by GPs because there has never been a need for it.

**I agree that the proposed changes are fair. My point is that this is a PR move, that cannot be implemented the way they imply it can (which they probably know)** because while it is easy to assign a cost to an individual dose of penicillin, it is not easy to assign how much an individuals treatment costs in more nebulus things like electricty, building maintaince, staff training or IT overheads - that kind of costing is not done at the individual patient level... if the government **really** push for this though then GPs might start to think about it.

On top of that, how is the Time War a secret? How is what he did a secret? He tells it to all his companions, time sensitive beings know of it as well and he has a god damn book about it in his TARDIS.

If that's supposed to be a secret then it's a lousy one.

Also, killing of two races to preserve the universe is exactly what the Doctor does, he makes the choice no one else can or would. What is one species compared to the universe? 

So no, I don't think he's pre-1 or 8.5 

I personally think he's 12. Obviously the Doctor had foreknowledge of him. How he acquired that is an open question, one that will possibly get answered anyway. John Hurt is the secret he's been running from all his life, so this mandates he knows about it.

This ties back in with the untempered schism nicely as it's possible he saw him there and that's what  caused him to run. 

I don't think the Doctor would be able to do something without choice in the name of peace and sanity, but not in the name of the Doctor that the Timelords would explicitly condone anyway. 

The Timelords were a strict bunch with insane amount of power. No way they'd let something like that slide or otherwise never mention it.

So the only solution is that the event hasn't actually happened yet. 

It's also just like Moffat to try and steer people the wrong way. The whole prophecy thing, the ""fall"", ""the question"", even the name of the episode itself. All misdirection and play on words.

**How easy would it be to get a job for the summer?**

Where you will be staying will depend on the ease of finding (temporary) work. You're brightly coloured hair *may* be a problem, but for bar work etc it shouldn't be - especially if you go search in a student area.

**Would it be hard to make friends?**

This depends totally on you. If you are easy, outgoing and willing to put yourself out there (doing new stuff, activities etc) you shouldn't find it hard to make friends - we arent as ""closed off"" as Scandinavian and Nordic people are thought to be in general.

**If I would get ill, do I get free/cheap healthcare without british citizenship?**

Yep. The NHS should cover you if you need medical treatment.

It depends on the market when you move here, and where you will be applying. However with a Masters in a Social Science you stand a good chance of getting a good job fairly quickly (maybe in consulting or something). If you have any work experience, that would definitely be a bonus, especially if you can spin it as international experience.

**Do I have to start worrying about house and pensions for my older days right at the start, or can I leave that to the future?**

The sooner you start saving for later life, the better. There are plenty of people who live paycheque to paycheque though. Its probably better to start off just settling in, and once you are comfortable you can make long term plans and decisions.

Wisdom I firmly believe will be our next RB and one for the long term. McLaughlin is still a few years out, and Flannagan needs to step up his game quickly. Robinson ""the next Bale"" would also do well to catch Brendan's eye in the next couple of seasons.

British citizenship: you might find this page useful. http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/britishcitizenship/eligibility/naturalisation/standardrequirements/. There is a test (see the 'life in the UK' link), although it might change in the coming years as it's come under a lot of criticism recently.

We are generally advised to start thinking about a pension as soon as possible. The government is introducing a scheme whereby every employer has to contribute to a pension scheme for their employees, but it doesn't hurt to set up a private pension too. There is of course the state pension as well, for which you would qualify once you were a citizen and paying national insurance, but the state pension is looking a little precarious and is not very big anyway, so it's advisable to think ahead. This link may help you with this: https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/categories/pensions-and-retirement.

Regarding making friends - this partly depends on whereabouts you end up living. It can be a lot harder in large urban places like London (where you don't often talk to your neighbours much!) but I'd suggest a good way to make friends is to participate in a hobby of some kind. If you're doing something that interests you, you're likely to meet like-minded people. If you're out in the countryside then getting involved in your local community is a great way to meet people and to help keep smaller villages thriving.

true,Halk,scot-lanarkshire,Lanarkshire,"Ok... I'll try and explain all of my arguments in one post.

Defra is there so that we don't need to do the investigative work ourselves. They make the decisions on behalf of us.

We can't realistically have a system where there's both Defra and us making decisions. Even if you have labels listing lots of information, someone needs to decide what information goes on those labels. Does BSE go on there, or foot and mouth. And what about the neighbouring farm information.. etc etc. 

Defra must use a ton of information to make decisions so we'd need all of that information to make the decision ourselves - that would cause a whole new level of administration for food labelling and make it incredibly difficult for a butcher to operate - either locally or at supermarkets. 

So my view is that we either have the Defra route or no route - and I think it's obvious the Defra route is the right one.

The next thing which I've not talked about yet is Defra themselves being fit for purpose. The limited information I've read shows no reason to believe Defra are wrong about bovine TB. That would mean that either they're inept, or that they're corrupt. If it's inept then they're still doing a better job that I could. If they're corrupt then we couldn't trust them to correctly label things in any case.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"All GP surgeries that are part of the NHS (which is effectively just about all of them) use the above method. 

For an insurance breakdown obviously some things can be accurately costed, like blood tests, prescribed drugs etc. For consultation rates there are recommended amounts set out by the RCGP (Royal College of General Practitioners) although these aren't compulsory. Theoretically they account for those nebulus overheads.

Itemised breakdowns are also usually only done for a few specific reasons which helps with the costing -- so for many things the RCGP just sets out recommended amounts, not only for the consultation time but for the entire intervention... for example

* Insurance companies for - Whiplash, lower back pain, life insurance policies etc.

* Employers - Armed forces medicals, employer health checks, occupational health assessments.

* Individuals - Vaccinations for travels, medical examinations for visa requirements, getting copies of health records etc. 

I should mention - the exception to all of this is that hospitals **do** have a mechanism for breaking down costs to an individual level for some things, particularly surgical procedures and 'number of bed-days spent in hospital'. However, it is not particularly accurate. 

The reason is, a GP might see 2400 very different diabetic patients out of their 10,000 patients, varying hugely in cost between them... so it is easier to cost them as a large group than as individuals. But a typical district general hospital probably only does ~400 appendicetomies a year (probably the most common surgical procedure). There are only two main types of operation and two types of follow up: open or laprascopic surgery and with or without an inpatient course of antibiotics afterwards.

So after staying in hospital, each patients' notes get sent to a department called clinical coding where a special type of medical secretary reads them and gives them a unique 'clinical code'. Each of these codes has an associated cost that is reimbursed by the NHS/DH. For example something like:

&gt; A00-1A: *open appendicetomy £1700*

&gt; A00-1B: *open appendicetomy with antibiotics £1800*

&gt; A00-2A: *Laprascopic appendicetomy £2100*

&gt; A00-2B: *Laprascopic appendicetomy with antibiotics £2200*

The problem is, patients often fall under multiple codes - and so are usually coded for whichever gives the hospital the most cash. Take the above example, say the patient develops a post-operative infection in their open appendicetomy wound... lets pretend that has a clinical code *""XX-01: Infection treated with antibiotics and incision drainage £2100""*... that would be the code that patient gets since it pays £400 more, if however the code gave only £1600 (£100 less) then they would probably be coded as the original appendicetomy.

If that patient had left the hospital and returned, then it would potentially (depending on how long they were out for) be counted as two seperately costed stays, so the hospital would get £1700 from the appendicetomy, and another £2100 for the incision drainage...",0,1372601585,null,0,1372602003,0,cat5rff,t3_1hcsvy,t1_cat5rff,t1_cat5bwe,null,1430632797,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

However, he is a quality player(not 25 mil but still) and is a type of midfielder we don't have, Frank Lampard-esq. The question is if Gerrard n Lampard never worked for England how will this work for us? The answer is he is Gerrard's replacement and thus we expect Gerrard to teach him, enhance his game in areas he's weaker, and over the course of the season groom him to take over slowly but surely the season after.

Why do fans care so much? Why does the transfer season mean so much?

I'd venture it means the most to clubs like Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham, and similar clubs around the globe. Clubs that have some history (strike Tottenham from that) but haven't had a great recent history. Clubs that are nearly there. Clubs that are on the precipice.

I think there's a reality that rarely is said about how going into a new season there is hardly anything but eventuality. Meaning, we know Utd, City, and Chelsea are likely to own the top three spots. They should at least. There's only one spot that isn't guaranteed and thats 4th.

And then there's the fact that 4th is only 4th. For us, it'd be huge. It'd mean Champions League. But we'd still be off. There'd still be a ladder to be climbed. Strive on strive on strive on we'd say.

So the transfer window becomes a time for another sort of victory. We lost out on two transfers to Tottenham last summer, perhaps both to our benefit in retrospect, but it killed last summer because it said something about how we were perceived by world football. We were not bigger than Tottenham. All our history didn't matter. The painful present was our present. And so we sought some alleviation from that in the transfer market. A victory there that we couldn't get on the pitch. Some sign that our club really was better, even if it wasn't showing it right now.

And here we are again. Searching for that satisfying proof that someone picked us. We want to be picked. We want proof we are wanted. That our club matters. That it counts on the world stage. And we need that in the transfer market because we aren't getting it on the pitch.

This is why these things matter. But once you have success you don't really care so much about all this stuff. So here's to hoping someday soon we'll have a window where we just expect the talent to come our way.",0,1372607478,null,0,false,0,cat7656,t3_1hcptv,t1_cat7656,t3_1hcptv,null,1430632137,15,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,15

Wilf, who appears in the christmas special Voyage of Doom was actually only supposed to be an old man selling newspapers. When the actor who played Donna's father died, Wilf became Donna's grandfather.

The cattle they are discussing and are released into the food chain are those cattle that have been exposed to M. Bovis infection i.e. ""reactors"". They test positive as they have been exposed at some point and it is this exposure that is being detected not necessarily active disease. Mycobacterial species can lay dormant (latent) and the risk of transmitting infection would be absolutely minuscule. In addition whilst m. bovis can spread to the muscle in cattle, it is again exceptionally rare.

To put it into perspective roughly a third of the human population would test positive for TB, however a third of the world do not have active TB.

With regard to raw/undercooked beef, you are at far higher risk of getting e. coli infection and so the precautions you want to take, you should already be taking.

Also, it's a [staggeringly unpleasant organisation](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/10055532/RSPCA-whistleblower-found-hanged.html). Not only do they [react hysterically and ruin people's lives with laughable cases](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/pets/10149908/The-RSPCA-made-US-feel-like-criminals.html), they waste donations on it [while killing thousands of 'rescued' animals each year because they've spent all their money on being dickheads](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/the-rspca-can-it-destroy-and-protect-animals-at-the-same-time-8470469.html).

Not to mention the case where they [dragged a grieving family through the High Court](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/daughter-wins-rspca-inheritance-battle-1800221.html) over a will, or more recently when they published a [misleadingly histrionic advert about the badger cull](http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/topics/rspca-badger-cull-advert-draws-complaints/344560.article). They kill dogs [in horrible ways](http://www.germanshepherdrescue.co.uk/rspca-captive-bolt.html) (which [the police investigated them for](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/6475301/Police-investigate-RSPCA-for-animal-cruelty-over-dog-deaths.html), this time) and they've also got a weird culty following who won't hear a bad word said against them.

&gt;Ms Draper thought her German shepherd dog’s skin condition was due to the fleas, so she gave him another shampoo. She would have taken him to her vet if it had persisted, but she didn’t get the chance. Two weeks after she gave him the second wash, the RSPCA, alerted by a tip-off, swooped. She hasn’t seen Becks since, even though she was acquitted.

and

&gt;Claiming the puppies had been left “wet and shivering”, the RSPCA brought criminal charges against not just Tracey Johnson, but her 16-year-old daughter.

and

&gt;For generations, the people of many working-class areas, especially former pit villages in the North, have gone out rabbiting to catch something for the pot. It is perfectly legal – and widely practised – but in 2011, the RSPCA prosecuted Amber West, a County Durham girl aged just 13, for it. They said she hadn’t killed the rabbit swiftly enough. “She knew what she was doing. She knew she wasn’t in the wrong and she was upset,” says her mother, Karen Ainsley.

&gt;“She was given a £200 fine and a 10-year ban on keeping animals. We took it to appeal and the judge wiped everything off except for a conditional discharge, and said she was free to go out with her dog and her ferret that day if she wanted.” The local newspaper printed a string of falsehoods about the case – planted, Ms Ainsley believes, by the RSPCA. “I was scared,” said Amber. “Hardly any of it was true. I thought I was going to lose all my dogs. I wasn’t even allowed to buy dog food at the pet shop.”

I mean, what cunts.

Anyway there's a reason why the RSPCA isn't well-liked, and why it draws criticism from everyone from ministers to former donors.

Otherwise, perhaps change the blue background to horizontally split between white and green, as in the Welsh flag.

A study in 2002 estimated 24 cases a year of people catching TB from infected meat. Rates of TB in cattle were much lower then.

It can take 10 years for the disease to show up, so we don't really know if recent increases in the number of infected carcasses has had any effect.

The risk is probably reasonably low, but common sense says not to eat infected meat.

But the main problem is that they're in your face all of the time to try to get you to show one bit of weakness.

The solution would be to limit the same day loan to a smaller amount, and have a delay for a larger amount. But more importantly to restrict the repayment to 15% of net income.

Those steps would mitigate the nasty effect of these loans to a large degree. 

The problems are...

* People who take them cannot afford to repay them the next month.
* They allow people with virtually no income to take them.
* They're only ever seconds away from people in poverty and waved in front of their faces dozens of times a day

UNLIMITED DATA

Giffgaff offer Truly Unlimited Internet on the £10 goodybag and above.

THERE IS NO FAIR USE POLICY / DATA LIMIT

But there ARE terms and conditions regarding usage patterns:

The only things you need to remember are:
NO TETHERING
NO CONSTANT DOWNLOADING OR STREAMING

You can use as much data as you like, i've personally used over 20gb quite a few times..
..just dont hammer the network 

TIPS:
Use wifi whenever possible
Stream movies instead of downloading them
If you download/stream a large file, wait a while before downloading/streaming any more..
If you're streaming a football match, stop the stream at half time then reconnect at kick off

Its all about using the data FAIRLY..
There's no actual Fair Use Policy, as giffgaff are trusting us to use our common sense..
People have been banned for using around 3gb, but that was obviously done in a short space of time, therefore deserving a ban

Todays phones are very powerful and have great quality screens for watching movies, tv and playing games etc
Movies are around 1gb each
Streaming a football match uses around 1gb
Albums are around 200mb
Games can be up to 2gb each with additional files

..so its easy to use large amounts of data, especially if, like me, you have no wifi available

PEOPLE THAT GET BANNED

The people in this 1% (the ones that recieve a ban) are downloading files, either tethered or transferred off their mobiles later, or streaming videos from their mobile phone to TV's, downloading everything off iTunes, to listen to on other devices outside of their mobiles or anything else you can think of, that basically means the use was never intended for use on a mobile or only partly (as examples: downloading more music than could realistically fit on your phone, or a need to download and watch HD quality movies on a mobile device or stream video content for more than 8 hours a day are all either not intended for mobile use or can be considered a highly unlikely usage pattern).

true,yurri,cnty-uk,London,"Okay - very briefly, I disagree because of the following:

a) Trade: sure, you'll be still able to buy a German car, just as in any country in the world which isn't in the EU. Problem is it's very unlikely you'll still be paying the same price for it.

Depending on your position you might benefit from the the above (e.g. you focus on the UK market and welcome fewer European competitors on the UK market)... or, if you're a UK manufacturer selling something to the EU, you'll find it much harder to compete for the EU market.

b) Travel: unlike joining the EU, the process of leaving it isn't formalised, and if it's going to happen, it'll be the first precedent. It's very possible that the UK citizens will still enjoy transparent borders like say Swiss do despite not being in the EU, but that can't be guaranteed.

Even if borders will be still invisible for tourists and rich pensioners (read: spenders), young people will find it more frustrating, especially if the UK tuition fees keep rising. The number of British people working in Germany or France isn't tiny as well (about 8% of UK citizens live abroad - not all of them in the EU, of course, but still that is hard to ignore).

c) Funding: indeed, the UK pays more than receives back... directly. There are massive indirect benefits from the common market, and in addition to that the country gets some of its contributions back. It is quite possible that these funds could've been spent wiser without that additional link in the chain, but so far the priorities the government has for its spending don't look very attractive.

I agree with the 'undemocratic' bit though. The system is far from being ideal.

I understand you are ready to address these points as well, and that Reddit is full of similar discussions with little variations.

you want a degree in philosophy and study in London, sounds like a fairytale but in reality it is a very expensive mistake. first, London isn't nice to live IN particularly. you would be better in the more suburban areas IMO. 

second is the course and career path, how many jobs can you realistically get with philosophy? you say you want to be a lecturer, fair enough, but how many years experience do you need in your field to be one? 20? or alternatively a PhD.

my honest opinion, dont bother. look for a job, your home country may be poor for youth employment well so is ours. Germany is one of the best in the EU for this, and most of Germany speak English. Also there are tuition fees? how are they paid for? if it is out of your own pocket thats £9k you could spend on rent. other EU countries will probably be a lot cheaper or free tuition. 

yes we have free healthcare to EU citizens but I wouldn't recommend coming over here if you cant afford to live. to live in cheap accommodation, with food and bills etc for me last year was around £6000. plus money for flights etc.

Your other point however, about the free trade agreement would work both ways. If we pay an EU import tariff, so will the EU on UK produce. As one of the major economies, it's mutually beneficial to keep our free trade agreements open. If it means adherence to low carbon emissions on our EU exports, those businesses won't have to readjust as the rules are in place now. If it means Romania has to meet our safety standards in regard to meats, they should continue removing the gangs that control those industries.

The trade will more than likely continue to operate without tariff charges, I'd bet money on that.

true,Stargazer34,num5-away,,"I'll take the flack for this but here's an alternative idea to our future...

What if we look at next season with real optimism. Man Utd is hopefully going to endure growing pains, City are shit, we were not far off of them for most of the season not to mention the other teams all having new managers, now the lads will get a full off season in under AVB and I think that will prove a key factor.

Let's say we move Huddlestone, Parker, Defoe, maybe Ade, ( Dempsey? Lennon?) who really knows if that's unrealistic but even if a few leave, we free up old/unwanted contracts and move these players out, we have a bit more cash now.

Then let's say we do get Paulinho, our beast as hell defensive midfield is stacked, we still really could use a "" Modric"" ..enter Halilovic, this guy really is the complete package for what Spurs need to fill the gap. This guy has:

- Pace, just absolutely sick pace
- Vision - He really has quick reactions and unreal vision for 17...
- Shot - He is still developing and perfecting his technique but it is extremely bale-esque 

I could go on and on but I think he is a mix of Bale and Modric, take a look at this https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_214887&amp;feature=iv&amp;src_vid=kyQ3hM3MYho&amp;v=KDzm1T2rTiY

Buy Tin Vaj - Great, now we have another great young talent, Gallas is gone, who knows what happens with Kaboul's knee...who knows how good Caulker really will be, he sucked hard at the U-21's..sorry, it's true. Now Mr. Tin Vaj is REALLY looking like a good option, Daws isn't getting younger, Tin could really learn from Daws and Jan at this stage...wow, that'd be scary good. 

Now to summarize so far, what i've suggested improves us in these ways:

- Paulinho provides an unstoppable wrecking force of Dembele, Sandro &amp; Paulinho double pivot style midfield.


-  A Modric type creative mid field maestro crossed with a pacey beast with a real pair of shooting boots ala Bale in Halilovic 

- Tin Vaj replaces the loss of Gallas, plus potential world class cover for Kaboul, Dawson, Caulker provided one gets injured or doesn't develop well enough etc.

Now find a way to get a striker, NOT David Villa, follow me here, we've invested in one hell of a team at this point in my argument, we need a young striker or two within the next season or two. Don't go nuts buying an over priced player for a short term fix, we had a lot of scoring from bale, should at any point Lennon get going consitantly, or siggy or holtby or god forbid Ade or Paulinho etc etc, we will have a lot of goals, what I would like to see is somebody like Benteke or P.A.E bought. Then we are developing into a team built around a system with a purpose in mind - as AVB is a great tactician.

I couldn't care less about celebrities, it was just a blatant example that no one can be ignorant of. Child grooming is being deliberately promoted as an exclusively Muslim thing by groups like the EDL. Newspapers that agree with their ethos e.g. The Daily Mail are promoting it.

true,ShanghaiNoon,null,null,"Migrants can if their consumption of resources is greater than their production. Welfare spending has to come from somewhere and it is coming from the production of other people or debt which means future production. 

The jobs argument is a weak one and one which has been debunked countless times through research/studies on immigration. It's so common it has even got a name, the [lump of labour fallacy](http://www.economist.com/economics-a-to-z/l#node-21529454). In reality, immigrants boost aggregate demand through their spending which *creates* jobs and/or raises incomes. Also, it's usually not the case that immigrants are in direct competition with native workers, they tend to be disproportionately over-represented in areas where there isn't a huge clamour by natives to work in such fields. Also immigrants tend to be disproportionately self-employed and likely to start up new businesses which mean they are *creating new jobs* which they then occupy rather than applying for one which already exists. Take Indian (or other) restaurants, shops, fast food outlets, dry cleaners etc. In the sectors where (working class) immigrants do find work it tends to be in roles which are highly undesirable like cleaning jobs during unsociable hours, manual labour on farms/factories (again often during unsociable hours) so it's not as simple as often made out. 

Regarding the construction sector which is understandably one of the areas where immigrants *are* in direct competition with British workers, as you yourself point out if an immigrant can do the job of equal/better quality for a lower price there's no value in paying a higher fee for that service. Inevitably some British builders will have lost work because of immigrant builders winning those contracts/jobs but these are builders who aren't as productive and thus shouldn't be doing that job in the first place. The vast majority of British builders/tradesmen aren't going to be competing directly alongside these new immigrants as they have greater productivity and thus don't compete for the same jobs. A lot of British companies in the industry also benefit from the surge in productive tradesmen entering the workforce and are thus able to expand and bid for new contracts which may have previously been taken by a foreign company (often Chinese). Protectionism in such a manner only harms domestic industry and productivity in our own economy which will only benefit foreign countries and their own economies at our expense. 

I'm in favour of a liberal migration policy - both in and out - as freedom of movement is crucial to boosting economic growth and making sure resources are allocated in the most productive manner. This benefits everyone in the long run and also reduces income/wealth inequality as labour can freely follow the movement of capital. It is also in the interests of human liberty, I don't think you'd be happy if you continuously had to be subjected to lengthy and arbitrary border checks if you travelled from one postcode to another so I don't see why it is acceptable along national boundaries. It is oppressive to one's liberty to be subjected to such lengthy process without being a credible threat to the health and safety of others.",0,1372628442,null,0,false,0,catdky6,t3_1hcsvy,t1_catdky6,t1_cata50y,null,1430628281,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

So even if the money being discussed isn't on the same scale as for a senior player Dinamo would still know there was money to be made.  In fact, an argument could be made for them to keep both players until they *are* established names and could be sold for a fee more like Luka's.  So we had to offer enough to make it worth their while not to do that, and that would take negotiating.

Above that you're only due to pay on the remaining £5k at the lower rates of tax. Under £13k you are entitled to some tax credits which I expect you wont have claimed. There's also the fact that being self employed you can claim back some of your rent and bills as expenses (if you work from home) and clothing / tools depending on how much you use those things.

You're possibly guilty of not paying some tax but it's an amount that is potentially so small that I expect the HMRC would not be able to justify the paperwork. It's entirely a moral issue with you if you wish to pay previous years, but paying your NI (which will be very little) and company tax will not break the bank. They can only go back 5 years anyway.

true,strummist,null,null,"Homeless in London is no joke. It's fantastically dangerous and terrible for your health and mental health. Life expectancy for the homeless is about 48, which should give you some idea of how tough it is.

Shelters are underfunded and will be getting less support in the years to come. They are already overloaded with people who really, really need the service, and a few people who are .. um .. not the sort of people you'd ever want to meet. Many of the staff and users will resent a ""tourist"". If you are capable of studying philosophy at degree level, you have far more choices in life than many service users, and you should be using them.

If you are very lucky you might find somewhere extremely cheap to live in London with minimal facilities, and - also if you are very lucky - you might be able to get enough work to pay for it.

What you might be able to do if you are very likeable is to make friends with a group of people who let you stay on their sofa, in a garage or something. However you can't count on that lasting for your entire stay unless you're a very charming person.

Another option if you are sociable is to find a squat that will let you in - some of these are dangerous and unpleasant, but others are very supportive communities. The good sort are, however, very wary of strangers.

My advice is to get a job - no matter how shitty - and work as many hours as you can, save as much money as you can. During term time reduce your working hours.

A final option might be to find someone disabled who employs a live-in carer. You could do the night sleepover shift and get a bit of money and somewhere to sleep.

true,ravniel,num11,,"&gt; In short, our primary weakness is in midfield, not up front.

We have weaknesses in both positions.  Obviously we need to sign a player like Paulinho but there's no way that can substitute for a new striker.

&gt; Defoe and Ade will put the ball in the back of the net if you put them in the right positions.

Except that they've clearly shown that this isn't necessarily the case.  Defoe is a good goalscorer who hit excellent scoring form in the first part of the season, but he dropped off thereafter and when we needed Adebayor to pick up the slack he manifestly was not there.  And they both got *plenty* of good chances.  Yes, we had some trouble breaking down defenses after Sandro got injured but both players (Adebayor especially) got into ""the right positions"" any number of times and didn't do what we needed them to do.

This isn't just a matter of form, either.  Even at their best Defoe and Adebayor aren't world-class strikers.  Defoe is a *very good* striker, and I'd be perfectly happy to keep him if we only purchase one striker this summer.  Adebayor has a lot of overall strengths as a player but has *always* been a profligate finisher.  Even when his actual scoring numbers look good (as they did for us in 2011-12) you can look closer and see that his actual chance conversion is weak.  Whoscored did an analysis towards the end of the 2011-12 season showing that Adebayor was one of the worst starting strikers in the league at converting clear-cut chances.  He's got many good qualities but he just isn't clinical.

We let in too many goals last season, sure.  But we also scored too few, and that's down to the men upfront as much as the system.  We *need* a new striker.  We needed one in January.  As long as we ignore this deficit we're always going to be one signing away from a top-class team.",0,1372629602,null,0,false,0,catdydj,t3_1hdpap,t1_catdydj,t1_catdhxj,null,1430628105,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

true,tehubercarbooter,null,null,"The Edge lane car boot sale is very very good on a Sunny day. Today it was quite busy but has been better. This car boot sale is only less than a year old so it is still new but gets a good draw, and can only get bigger.

There is one in Bootle which always has a good turn out but the Edge lane one is bigger. 

There is one just off Lister Drive but due to a fire a few months back this only has a couple of stalls left.

The St Helens car boot sale has dropped over the past year or two. It has a good turn out if it is raining as most people who go to Bootle or Warrington will go here instead as it is mostly indoor. Can be a mix of items but it is a very closed off space so if you don't like crowds maybe give this one a miss as the ratio of people to stalls is quite high.

Another is in Warrington opposite the B&amp;Q off the M62. This one is very big and in the summer gets a great turn out. A lot of cool figures and toys I've seen at this one.

There is a very big car boot sale called Burscough, touted as the biggest carboot in the north west you can spend many hours here. It is either on a field or airstrip depending on time of year. Good day out though. Can find anything here and it is sometimes on BBC car boot shows etc.

If you wanted to go further out there is one in Stockport (Burnage rugby club), Manchester (Bowlers) and Stockport (Chelford). The Chelford one is pretty big on a field again, and the Bowlers is big and is a mix of indoor and outdoor.

Anyway I would recommend Bootle / Edge lane as a weekly car boot. I tend to go to Bootle first and then pop over to Edge Lane after. I have only been to Edge Lane early once and it was quite hectic and many of the stalls weren't there yet as it is supposed to be a later car boot sale.  This was a few months ago though so maybe it is better now early.

For a one off every now and then it's really worth visiting Warrington and Burscough even if it's only once.",0,1372630421,null,0,false,0,cate7nm,t3_1hb088,t1_cate7nm,t3_1hb088,null,1430627983,3,false,Liverpool,t5_2r21z,3

All you can do is wait until the tech to encrypt everything becomes mainstream. It will happen, as our lives become more digital it will be necessary to keep data out of the hands of criminals. The best we can do is to assist those writing these tools e.g. the EFF, GNU, etc. Focus more on tools, not laws. Governments ignore laws, why waste your time pushing for ineffectual measures?

And granted, for a healer to be transformed into a WMD, let alone against his will, and to be conscience of the experience the whole time it's happening...well, it might explain why he 'forgets' that part of himself.

It is an unrealistic request to be self sufficient, with no savings, income or supplementary support. You may well end up starving and stealing? A criminal record and being taken off the course likely to help you find a job?

You may have a glorified vision of London for whatever reason, but if you cannot afford to live in the city of find a job in it at this time do so at a later point in your life.
