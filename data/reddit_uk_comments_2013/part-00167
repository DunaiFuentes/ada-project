The passengers and government were held for ransom and the whole thing was leaking money like a sieve ... not to mention the aged rolling stock, buildings and rails, and their inability for any train to actually arrive when it was supposed to.

true,sperf,null,null,"The biggest question mark for Chelsea right now is the striker situation. Most fans are excited about Lukaku, especially after his fantastic season at West Brom. However, there is disagreement about whether he is ready to lead the line, as he is still very much a raw talent. Torres is still a polarizing figure here: many fans love him (arguably irrationally) while others wish to see him rot in the reserves (if he can't be sold). What most fans can agree on about him is that he is wildly inconsistent but links up play with the midfield better than any of our other current strikers. Finally, there's Ba: the forgotten man. It seems most fans don't see a future for him at Chelsea while some others feel he never got a proper chance. I believe he is our best finisher but is relatively weak in our build-up play. 

Most fans would love to land Rooney, who would no doubt become our first choice striker. However, his signing would create a problem: we'd have four strikers for one spot. Ideally, we'd unload Torres, but it's hard to imagine another club picking up his massive wages when he has never looked deserving of them. It would be fairly easy to sell Ba, but that would still leave us with 2 strikers on massive wages (Torres and Rooney). No one in their right mind would want to get rid of Lukaku.

Nobody outside of the BBC cares.

The reason the BBC is given billions of taxpayers money each year is to allow them to produce quality programmes, which they frequently do. They obviously have to produce things people want to watch, but you can create comedy and drama which is popular *and* well made.

The fact that it is tax payers money means that there are things ITV does which the BBC really shouldn't touch. For example, a lot of people watch Jeremy Kyle, should the BBC make him a better offer to jump ship? No, it is ratings grabbing crap and the BBC should not be that desperate for viewers.

I happen to think that there is another thing the BBC should not doing with *our* money. They shouldn't be paying obscene amounts of it to individual performers. It isn't as if the BBC can make a *better quality* chat show than anyone else, so why waste so much money just to chase ratings.

Tourism funds a lot, as well as the wealthy buying holiday homes. But still, the Isle of Wight drastically needs funding and connection. It is clear (having worked on the island for over a year) that it is financially and politically separate. A large number of retirees live there and many are against things such as a bridge (even wind turbines cause a huge stir).

The bridge will fix much of that, it will allow for far cheaper transport (primarily freight and building materials). It will also bridge the gap (ohohoho) for local businesses to reach out and tend to demand along the south coast. Commuting will be more available and accessible. Short term tourism will be boosted.

Basically, the IoW needs a sharp kick up the ass and dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century or it's dead.

Of course more players can be brought in during January but it might be too late at that point (much like last season).

I've not advocating for a blanket policy of people with special needs being allowed to do whatever they wish, that doesn't meet anyone’s needs. But I cannot go unchallenged the precept that as they have special needs they are disruptive. One lady I’ve worked with for a year now I would never take on a train as she would scream the place down but I've also been working with a gentleman that I regularly travel by train with as he really enjoys it. 

In the case of the gentleman when we travel I take him out of his wheelchair and get him to sit next to the window and I sit next to him. When we are sat like that people don’t get he has special needs and it allows him to be part of the world he has a right to be a part of for a while. The lady however has a combination of high intelligence and low communicative ability, in her life I’m the first person that has seen it and after a year still have to fight to get investment to support her communication. In her case I would not (well not right now) take her on a train as she would scream the place down. 

These are two adults that have special needs and need to be considered as humans with their own needs and behaviours just like anyone else. 

As for getting work done on a train, I agree but the assumption that just as you have special needs you are loud is simply indefensible regular kids can be just as disruptive.

This shouldn't be a difficult topic people with special needs are people and should be conidered as so with the same rights.

It will however be fluid and the squad will be picked according to the situation. 

A number of factors come into play as to who our best 2 pivot players would be if we were to play that system. 
I think Mourinho is likely to start with experience, Lampard if fit will play more than we might think. Mourinho should be able to bring the best out of him again this season. The same with Essien. But fitness plays a role with both these players. 

it's hard to judge the new players until you see them playing competitive football in England. I certainly don't expect van ginkel to start most matches. Ramires will definitely be used however. Mourinho has spoken of his admiration of the player and he seems to fit his style. 

Tl;Dr we'll be in a better place to judge these questions about the squad after 10 league games. Even then it depends very much on the opposition.

Yes,  stereotypes exist for a reason.

But not for your reason, stereotypes allow us to build a quick and easy picture of those we meet. 
This is a very quick and dirty simple classification that allows us to make a very quick judgment on a person, however the short fall is that it attributes all people within that subset with the same characteristics.  The limitation is that people will not go beyond that stereotype unless they have experience of that subset or have their prejudice challenged.  

&gt; Somewhat tangential

No this is the point I'm working towards. 

Stereotypes have a use as a quick and easy tool but if you rely on them then you just become a tool (sorry for any offence but it was too good a line to not write).

true,KeepCalmMakeCoffee,eng-westmidlands,West Midlands,"&gt; This is intellectual laziness of the worst order. When the MMR thing kicked off they had a pro-vaccinators and and anti-vaccinators, and everyone assumed there must be something to it and there was something suspect about certain vaccines. Actually, the anti-vaxxers were just wrong.

It somewhat is, yes, but you just have to be sensible about what you apply it to. I was talking about opinion pieces here, not scientific debate. That's an entirely different area.
The fact that the press was reporting utter, utter lies was the real issue there.

But if you did want to apply it to the MMR (**Not that I think you should for a second**):

Extreme one: No adverse issues with the MMR jab

Extreme two: Autism and other issues could arise


Scientific studies: The MMR can have side effects like rashes and cause a fever (like a lot of medication on the planet), but they are rarely serious and not related to Autism.


There isn't a magic formula you can apply everything that the press says to and find the truth out, you just have to use your brain a little as opposed to taking everything on face value. Sometimes that might cause a bit of laziness, but researching every single story for the ""truth"" isn't possible. Filter out what's important (like MMR) and do checking where needed. Otherwise realise it's written by a human and probably has a flaw/s in it. Nothing more.

2. Bale is good because he scores goals without much help and he does it from the wing (a position which normally only gets a handful of goals, he get buckets). To learn how spurs play you probably need to watch a number of games. There are many intricacies, keep your eye on what the team does when they are attacking, defending, attacking from set pieces, defending from set pieces, just lost the ball and just gained the ball. The spurs philosophy is to attack. 

3. Don't have a checklist of who you need to hate, the rivalries will grow on you. Of course, we would like to be the best team in London (so rivalries with West Ham and Chelsea also exist - not so much with Fulham or Palace). Spurs fans also aren't too fond of Lazio nor Lyon recently because fans were attacked last season when attending away games. Also, Real Madrid are really fucking annoying (as are all big £ clubs, Chelsea, PSG, City, Monaco, I would even say Utd).

4. lol. Yids is the name of spurs supporters (yid is slang insult for jew. Tottenham is/was a jewish area and so picked up the name as other clubs used it as an insult. The name was adopted to take the sting out). COYS (come on you spurs) is also important.

5. Utd, City, Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal are the 'big games'. Be sure to catch spurs against decent European competition this season as they look to progress in the Europa league.

There were also plenty of occasions where he would lunge awkwardly at a dude and have him blow right by him.

No american thinks this.

&gt;  it was still the dominant force in the world until the early 20th century.

Nonsense. It could be said american military surpassed the british in the 1840s. But DEFINITELY by the end of the civil war ( 1860s ), america had the greatest military. We developed submarines, iron-hulled steamships, gatling guns, etc. The largest, best equiped army EVER at that time was the army of the potomac. 

&gt; Culturally the first language of the US could have been just as easily German or French as many many German and French speaking peoples emigrated and that is still visible today.

What a fucking idiot. By 1776, all the cultural, political, economic and historical legacy were in english and had been for HUNDREDS of years. The germans didn't start arriving en mass until the 1800s.

&gt; Could have just as easily been a monarchy or been Catholic.

Catholic? I love how you claim to know american history and yet didn't know how anti-catholic early america was. America was a heavily protestant nation. We didn't elect a catholic president until 1960s and haven't elected another catholic since.

&gt; Ultimately the reason the cultural similarities exist is because the majority of the people who helped shape the US were British.

NO KIDDING. Maybe now you are starting to understand. So how exactly was this a cultural war? We kept the language, religion, history, literature, most of the political ideas, etc..

&gt; This ""major loss"" of the east cost of the US by the British is barely a blip in British history

The east coast holds the economic and political center of the world today. That's like saying if I had a winning lottery ticket and lost it, it didn't mean anything. The brits didn't just lose the east coast, they lost the west coast and the middle. They lost the whole continental US. Not to mention they lost alaska since the russians sold it to the US to prevent further british expansion in western americans.

&gt; Canada was a proverbial goldmine of resources

Not compared to the US.

&gt; I can see why Americans like to think of it as a conflict of epic proportions leading to freedom through fire

We won a whole continent from the largest empire at that time. And we became the greatest nation of all time. So that's why americans are proud. I can see why the brits would like to forget it since they lost the great piece of real estate on earth. While america has the more resource rich and arable land, britain is just a few shithole islands.

Fred only shocked me later because I kept expecting it to reverse. Joyce was upsetting because 'The Body' was one of the greatest Buffy episodes ever made. Also because her death was natural we, as an audience, had not experienced such a thing in the series and felt as lost and powerless as the characters. 

Wash was something else. His death was shocking because it was so completely unexpected, even within the scene. Also, he'd already killed Book so it's not like we expected another main character to die.

But also of the cast Wash was probably the one we least expected to be killed. Whedon's deaths usually lead to something bigger: Joyce showed a new vulnerable side of Buffy; Fred pushed Wesley forward and brought Illyia to the picture; Coulson gave the Avengers something to fight for; and Book made Mal turn and prepare to fight. Even Penny made Dr Horrible truly the villain he wanted to be. However Wash gave none of that. The person to react most to his death was his wife Zoe, but she was already a fighter and was already signed on to the cause because of Book. In fact, it gave Zoe *less* to fight for and made her almost get herself killed. 

Traditional story telling would have suggested Zoe died which results in Wash becoming stronger. 

Wash's death is so shocking because it was so unexpected, unnecessary and just plain sad.

With all due respect, america is more important than hong kong, india, caribbean, france, spain, etc combined. If you think a city ( hong kong ) is more important than holding onto a resource rich continent, then so be it.

&gt; It's important to Americans because it's the founding of your country and that's you should most certainly learn about it but in terms of European history it's just that a blip this one thing that happened.

Talk about touchy. Maybe in terms of localized european history, american independence isn't important, but in global history it is.

It's not a touchy subject because it was not a culture war. Every point you make shows that it is not a culture war and yet you claim it is.

I paid about £200 for it last year from Amazon and I'd recommend it over the 50mm f1.8, great for portraits as it gets close to the 50mm standard on a full-frame sensor (it's also better made IMO).  And having f2 available does open up more options for lower-light images.

Having said that f3.5 on the 18mm-55mm kit lens should be fine - I only used a 13 second exposure at f2 and effectively 56mm, so you could go to 20 seconds or even 25 seconds before star trails become too noticeable as it's a wider lens (the rough rule of thumb is to divide your effective focal length into 600 to give a time in seconds, so 18mm becomes 28.8mm on a crop sensor and 600/28.8 = 20.8 seconds).  

If you shoot in RAW you can also get away with slightly under exposing and then increasing the exposure in the computer.  Set the ISO to 1600, zoom out to 18mm and try 20-25 secs in RAW.

And you get occasional things like the SDI 'particle cannon' that needed  a whole power of ten more energy output to do anything other than slowly slice through a plate of steel at point blank range.   

By the time they get that working people will be living in Tycho City. 

Edit: Ok reddit if you're so smart you tell me how to reliably stop an inbound nuclear warhead that in its terminal phase with a single shot 100% of the time.  Even the Americans can't get missile interceptors to work properly despite spending Billions of dollars on it and they move much much slower than the item in question.  PATRIOT failed miserably in Gulf War 1, SCUD's still came down with warheads functional and surrounded by flaming wreckage so that's a nonstarter.  Space based weapons are as I said in need of a SciFi energy source to power them so that's out as well.

In fact the only reliable way I can think of to stop a nuclear warhead is to NOT launch it in the first place. ",0,1376413219,null,0,1376418010,0,cbmxfhj,t3_1k9oxm,t1_cbmxfhj,t1_cbmx35p,null,1429843686,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3

&gt;Angel Trains was created in 1994 as part of the privatisation of British rail, it was briefly owned by the Japanese investment bank, Nomura Holdings (with other shareholders) until 1997 when it was bought for ~£395 million and became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group.


***(correction RBS sold it for £3.6 Billion in 2008)***

&gt;Porterbrook was created in 1994 as part of the privatisation of British Rail. In January 1996 it was sold in a management-employee buyout, and then in August 1996 it was bought by Stagecoach Group. In 2000 Stagecoach sold it on to Abbey National bank for £1.4bn. On Grupo Santander's takeover of the Abbey, ownership of Porterbrook passed to the Spanish bank. On 27 October 2008 Porterbrook announced that Abbey had reached an agreement to sell the company to a consortium of Deutsche Bank, Lloyds TSB and Antin Infrastructure Partners. The transaction was valued at £2 billion.

and the final one has also been sold..

&gt;Eversholt Leasing was established on 21 March 1994. It was subsequently purchased by a consortium of investors led by Candover in February 1996. HM Government realised a sale worth €883 million, however thirteen months later Candover sold Eversholt to Forward Trust, part of the HSBC Group for £726.5 million. HSBC Rail changed its name back to Eversholt in January 2010, and was sold to the Eversholt Investment Group consortium in November 2010.

&gt;The privatisation and subsequent sale of the ROSCOs caused a great deal of debate, since the UK National Audit Office asserts that the UK Government had not realised fair market value for the sale of the assets. Eversholt Leasing's MEBO (management/employee buyout team) purchased the assets for the business for £518 million in February 1996 and in February 1997 the business was sold on to Forward Trust Group for £726 million, a gain of some 40% over the sale price of the business from the UK Department of Transport.

Knowing and accepting are two different things. 

&gt; But if you have talents or skills then you may be able to look for a job first, go and get it, and then move once you have the job.

To quote a recruiter at Hays IT ""Live too far away, sorry we can't consider you.""   No job can't move, can't move no job.  

&gt;  If you're going for a job where the local town has 100 people just like you, you're in a bit of a fix and may need to look at moving first.

How?  That's the point.  Explain to how someone unemployed is supposed to move house without having a job to pay for it so they can improve their job prospects.  There is no mechanism, no system to enable this.  The only responses you ever get are ""Tough shit"" and ""Move to where the work is"" but nobody thinks it through and if you try and ask someone you just get ""Tough shit"" again.

These specific examples like Top Gear etc people keep pulling out of their arse aren't great arguments. For you and many people it is worth it yes.  For myself and many other people it isn't.  Why isn't there a choice instead of having it forced upon you? BBC has shitty reality shows.  It has game shows.  It has soaps. It has drama. It has comedy. It has documentaries. So does every other original terrestrial channel.  Sure theres now loadsa random channels that are niche to each different genre of programming but other than no adverts and we are forced to pay for it despite it being the same!  People think that is has 'more class' because it's the BBC but they are lying to themselves and need to stop drinking the kool-aid(apologies for the the american reference).  No wonder so many people refuse to pay for the licence tax.  If only I could get away with the other taxes like the top earners of the BBC probably do!

&gt;Who's military did you emulate?
Certainly not the british. No point emulating the loser.

For the love of god would you go read a book. The American military was run by former British military men, your army and navy use a near identical command structure. You used similar battleships and submarines were not your invention nor were Iron clads and most certainly tank warfare was nothing even considered in the US.

&gt;And we abandoned slavery after a few decades. The brits had slavery for a few centuries. Also, we never started. And britain didn't really abandon slavery ( after all they still own scotland ). :)

Yes we did we had it for a long time then we realised the error of our ways you had to sit and kill each other for a long time before some of you were forced to abandon it. More over you *still* have a problem with racism that doesn't seem nearly as prevelant in the UK.
Actually look up what Union means. Scotland isn't subservient to England. You also seem to misunderstand what the UK and Great Britain actually is. Here's a little tidbit the king of England James I was actually king of Scotland first James VI it was a mutually beneficial union the animosity of the wars of independence had been over for 300 years by that point.

&gt;I know it far better than you. Hopefully, someday, you'll have a country of your own to learn about.

I already do, Scotland has a history of millenia and Britain (the Empire and UK) has hundred of years of history. If this is some kind of attempt to wind me up to make me angry, you'll find it falls on deaf ears for many reasons. One being, as I stated, I already have several another being the current Scottish independence debate which means we will be voting next September to leave the United Kingdom.

Of course I could also say you're unlikely to get a rise from me because most of us don't subscribe to the mindless and illogical patriotism you are employing where you actively disregard evidence and logic to spout all sorts of nonsense that, as was inevitable, degenerated into childish name calling to make your point even less valid.

true,dtalbot,flair6,,"1. Im not so sure.

2. Some players are fast, some strong, some technical with great control and some are great passers or great tacklers. Bale is fast, strong and knows how to manipulate the ball. He can dribble at high speeds and has tricks up his sleeves to get around players - and a thunderous accurate shot. He is allowed a sort of free role which means he doesn't have to do a lot of defensive work, but he is our talisman in attack. 

3. I personally cannot stand teams that haven't properly earned their success (City and Chelsea are the main ones). Certain players grate me but you only have to watch a few games and you will instantly take a like or a dislike to players of either team.

4. The best insults are witty ones directed at players who have had a mishap or two in their private lives (John Terry etc.) Again, you will pick these up quickly.

5. I try to make sure I always watch every Tottenham game as I can't stand not knowing the score. Always try to watch big derby matches too as they can be brilliant with many goals and cards.

6. If you are selfish with the ball and have a good shot, play upfront. If you are a good passer and enjoy setting people up, play in midfield. If you can read the play and enjoy tackling, play in defence.

JSA only here, I do not tick any other boxes for other aid.

&gt; You MegaBus it if you can't afford other travel. 

Which you have to admit will only get you so far in a reasonable amount of time.  I mean technically I could get to Manchester via National Express (or similar) but it's 8+ hours each way.  So that's 16+ hours travel + a minimum of 8 hours (yeah, yeah, 9 - 5 don't we all dream?).  So you're going to make use of the train, logical yes?   But the math doesn't work out.  I can't travel for that month and eat, if I can't eat I'm going to drop.  In fact my back of napkin math suggests I could only afford to travel for 1 - 2 weeks of the month. 

So move closer you say.  We're right back to HOW.  Setting aside money is a laudable goal, cutting back on expenses and such all good stuff.  At the end of every fortnight I have around £3 left over to spend 'as I see fit'.    That's 16 months it'd take me to be in a position to move and that's assuming nothing untoward happens (cost of food goes up) to decrease the speed I could save at.

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; But its nothing to do with the business rates

It's nothing to do with business rates directly; what it is to do with is the price of a location, and that is the total of rates + rent.  It is the price that a tenant is concerned with, not how that total price is apportioned between the rates and rent.

The problem is that if you lower business rates, then the landlord hasn't had to suffer.  That is a subsidy, because the taxes have been lowered in order that the landlord can still get his rent.

The better solution is to leave the sight empty, costing the landlord the business rates and the lack of rent.  That cannot go on indefinitely, landlords have got to lower rents.  Your solution is, effectively, that the public purse should pay the landlord via the expedient of lowering business rates.

&gt; This further damages the economy of the high street as other businesses find vacant lots do not attract customers to the area.

Why is it business rates that is the one that's killing off business?  Why not VAT?  Why not corporation tax?  Why not employer's NIC?  Cutting any of those would help the small business for real; but business rates is the one that gets focussed on, despite the evidence that any lowering of business rates results in a raising of rent.

This is the attitude that will bring me, and others like me, to good situations. You have to adopt that attitude of ""I'll fucking do it one way or another"".

Pray you don't have a serious illness, or have to look after a family member. You'll also find that there's an age - around your mid to late forties - where things become more difficult faster than you can adapt. 

On a more social level, your words are simply enabling the continuation of an outdated work model and following the script that people just have to try harder. Civilisation *means* that it should be *easier* generation on generation to provide for oneself as we become interdependent and, thus, less prone to violence, greed and other destructive traits. 

You are aware, for example, that productivity has increased far more than employment? Meaning that we have sailed way past the point of diminishing returns when it comes to employing more people - it simply is no longer necessary to employ people to achieve gains in productivity - we have technology for that, and it's better than people. Productivity and economic performance are now effectively decoupled from employment, so it doesn't matter how hard you work - your labour is irrelevant and rapidly becoming obsolete.

&gt;  It sucks but if we all lived on another planet without a government, it'd be the strong who survived, who looked after their own. We're so dependant as a race now that unless we get help we think something is impossible.

Yes, that's called society and civilisation, Ms Rand. That interdependence is a requirement so that we can all live on a planet in relative peace, surviving on the fruits of our intellect and labour rather than violence. That economic survival may currently be in opposition to this is unfortunate, but interdependence is the only way to get scalable, sustainable and stable social systems.

Mate I could go on and on finding these. If you're telling me companies don't recruit directly then you need to pull your head out of your arse. I've just proved you wrong.

By better places, I mean better places to work. Not working in a cubical as a zombie or working in a shipping container in a car park, but actual enjoyable places to work. They do recruit directly, but if you can't find the jobs, then you're obviously not looking hard enough.

Honestly I've had enough of this. I'm wasting my Tuesday evening trying to encourage you so you can build a better life but fuck it. This is exactly why people look down on the unemployed and stereotype them as not trying hard enough. It doesn't matter what you do, what you say, if it doesn't come on a plate with a silver dish over the top of it then it's not good enough.

`&lt;sarcasm&gt;`Why don't I contact a company on your behalf, pay for your travel -- I'll drive you there myself, why don't you borrow one of my suits and I'll do your resume for you whilst I'm at it, you know what, why don't you live with me until you're on your feet, maybe I'll even go to work for you as well.`&lt;/sarcasm&gt;`

It's going to be interesting to see how Chevy and Manchester do, obviously, plus how women's plays out given how many people are 'doing' mixed.

The second teams could be interesting to watch, although I'm sure it'll be a similar situation to Uni Nationals where they got through thanks to weak regions and will both end up in the bottom 4. Except Fire, that is, they may well come towards the middle of the pack.

Remember the beginning of last season? He was doing quite well for a few games but after the Man U incident he lost it. The guy just needed some refinement, which involves a lot of playing time, and that just won't happen at LFC. 

He was a very typical young player. Rash, over-thinking, not quite tactically aware, etc. A decade ago I could literally be describing Gerrard with the same attributes but he got it under control and refined himself. I don't think Shelvey could ever been as good as Gerrard, few will, but no doubt he has the raw potential to become a very good midfielder (If he focus on his game and stay out of the clubs/parties).

I think Henderson is much more refined that Shelvey and ultimately will become a better player. He has great passing, positional awareness, and can run for days but he lacks that.. craziness(?) explosiveness(?), I can't find the word, that Shelvey had (despite Hendo's rather intense celebrations). 

**TL;DR:** Of course he'll be half-decent. The potential is obviously there it just needs to be refined.

Technically correct but utterly misses the point.

I'm sure some people use payday loans responsibly, but the sort of person who these loans are squarely aimed at is someone with abysmal credit history who has precisely zero chance of getting an overdraft facility, an emergency loan or indeed any other sort of credit. They've exhausted ""bank of family and friends"" long ago.

Payday is a week away but (here's the important bit) **even without a loan to pay back, their wages didn't get them through this month**. So how's it going to get them through next month when they're going to be down however much the loan is for?

Short answer: It probably won't.

Not to worry, take out another payday loan next month. Ah, but this time the money's run out a little earlier (which isn't surprising as there was less at the beginning of the month after the last payday loan was paid off). So you need to borrow a bit more.

True bank loans and CC's could be used as an interim solution to the problem but even with the credit crunch 'over' (yeah, right) they're exceptionally nervous to lend to someone without a solid employment history. 

In some respects what does get my goat is this: Department of Work... it's not Department of Unemployment.  I've seen plenty of programs come and go (both from inside and out the system) that can be summarised as 'statistic fiddling' but nothing that actually helps someone accelerate back up to speed that the first month would require.

Players I'm looking forward to improving this year are **Oscar**; with his suspected starting midfield position in the centre and Mata going right. 

I hope **Victor Moses** will continue to emphasize his preseason form, with his forceful, pressing attacks. He will at the very least provide strength and impact pressure on the wing in our growing rotation of midfielders.

**Cesar Azpilicueta**, aka ""Dave"" had a shaky start after transferring from Marseilles, but managed to find himself the regular starter under Rafa Benitez. With continued experience, I liken Dave to be one of the premier league's top right backs. I prefer him as a speedier option than Ivanovic at the right.

**Van Ginkel** has been blowing my pants off with his preseason match abilities. Taking on big clubs in our preseason tour with an impressive amount of confidence. I'm ready to see more of what he has to offer.

true,stordoff,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"If the food is bad enough to be in breach of contract (e.g. badly burnt, not as described), then you can leave without paying for it. It is standard practice (may be a legal requirement - I'm not sure) to inform the staff when you first notice the problem so they have the chance of putting it right, as well as leaving your name/address so that the restaurant can contact you.

If the problem is with the service, then you are entitled to not pay any service charges (I believe most/all of these are technically discretionary anyway). You might argue that the cost of the food includes service, and so reduce payment, but the restaurant will likely counter-claim that they made no representations as to the quality of service, only the food. You _probably_ can't refuse to pay for the food due to poor service (doesn't prevent you from asking for some sort of discount though).

The only time I can imagine that it would be illegal to leave (meaning criminal, not just breach of contract) is if you have committed theft. This requires you to have acted dishonestly (leaving your name/address and not paying with good reason in the first paragraph means you have acted honestly), so will likely only arise if you enter the restaurant with the intention to not pay regardless of the service/food provided.

true,shakawhenthewallsfel,lfc12,,"&gt; look highly likely to sell Uruguayan striker Luis Suarez for around £45-50m late in the transfer window and claim there was no opportunity to reinvest.

What is it, exactly, that makes that ""highly likely""? John Henry has said repeatedly and emphatically that he's **not** selling Suarez. Is there a chance he could be lying? Sure. But unless whoever wrote this has inside info, it's total horseshit to say it ""looks highly likely"" that's what's happening when every single statement the club and the owners have made say that isn't happening. 

Also, this general thesis, while depressing, doesn't make a ton of sense. FSG is a business; yes, it's looking to save money but it also wants to generate as much profit as possible, and the only way that's happening is with Liverpool in the Champions League. Tanking the team now for the sake of saving a few million pounds would be utterly idiotic if it means giving up a shot at much more money via CL in the long run (which it would). FSG knows this. 

Moreover, nothing about FSG's history says that's how it operates. When they took over the Red Sox the shook things up a bit and got rid of some well-liked players, but in the end they didn't tank the team, they turned it into a major player most years and ended a century-old curse. (Note, I hate baseball and the Red Sox, so I'm just going by wikipedia here).

true,OhMySaintedTrousers,null,null,"A former waiter (NB not a lawyer) opines: If a part of the meal is inedible (uncooked / corked wine etc.) you're quite within your rights not to pay for that part, and I think it's perfectly reasonable not to. As a general principle I'd always draw the waiter's attention to what's wrong first (nine times out of ten he'll fix it and you might get a free drink or desert, that was always my approach), complain politely but firmly second, and refuse to pay only as a last resort. And unless the service is absolutely *absent*, or downright offensive, I would make it bloody clear that I'm not paying before walking out. I've never had to do this, or seen it done.

Providing your expectations are reasonable and you're not an objectionable knob bothering other diners, any half decent restaurant will do their best to put things right long before the walk-out stage. 

*Very occasionally* shit goes seriously wrong even in nice restaurants. (Half the staff off sick on a very busy night, combined with a flood in the kitchen or something, it does happen, especially if the chef or an owner / manager is a bit of a premadonna! Believe me bad managers make bad nights much, much worse)

If, say, you've had three courses and two bottles of wine, but were just a disappointed with the meal and the service, and felt it was bad value, you are *not* entitled to the walk out routine IMO, unless you've complained a few times and been really badly treated. I would expect the police to be called by the restaurant if you tried it in those circs. A legitimate walk-out happens *during* the meal, not after you've finished it and had coffee. Noting stopping you complaining and getting the bill reduced though.

true,[deleted],null,null,"We as a club are somewhat obsessed with our glorious history and some of the glorious players and managers we were lucky enough to have, so I thought it would be valuable to give you a little run down of a small selection of some of the key figures in our history:

**Billy Lidell-** few people on reddit will have seen Billy Lidell play, but most of us know the name. He spent his whole career at Liverpool, breaking into the first team in the first post-WW2 season in 1947 and stayed in it until 1960, scoring hundreds of goals along the way. He was so instrumental that our club was nicknamed 'Liddlepool' during his playing days.

**Bill Shankly-** the Liverpool we all know and love would not exist without this great man. He took over as manager while we languished in the second division. The training facilities were crumbling and the future looked bleak. Shankly revolutionised everything at the club. He made us play in all red to intimidate opponents. The famous 'This is Anfield' sign was hung up by Shankly in order to make overawe opponents and remind the Liverpool players of the kind of club they were lucky enough to be playing for. He invented 'the boot room', a room in which he and his most trusted staff would discuss tactics and all things football. Every Liverpool manager until Graeme Souness in the 90s had been educated in this boot room. Shankly himself won the first division three times and the FA Cup twice (back when the FA Cup was a massive deal). He also deserves credit for every trophy we won in the decades after him, as without his foundations the mansion our club has turned out to be would not exist.

Shankly was not just a football man but a staunch socialist. He looked at everyone as equals, and this resonated with Liverpool, a city which has always leaned to the left. He responded to letters from fans in person, and would regularly buy tickets for deserving fans. There are a million anecdotes and quotes around that explain how great of a man man Shankly was, and I highly recommend you read some of them because I'm simply not a good enough writer to do him justice. 

**Ian Callghan-** Callaghan is most known for being our record appearance holder. He made an incredible 856 first team appearances, a record I am sure will never be broken. He played as a midfielder and won almost every trophy possible over his long career, including the World Cup.

**Bob Paisley-** Paisley had the massive job of succeeding Shankly, who had trusted him heavily during his own tenure as manager. What followed was undoubtedly the greatest era in Liverpool's history. Paisley was an astute tactician and built on the excellent foundations laid by Shankly. I think it's best to let his record speak for itself: during his 9 seasons as manager we won the league 6 times, the European Cup (now the Champions League) 3 times, the UEFA Cup once and the League Cup 3 times. He remains to this day the only manager to win the European Cup/Champions League 3 times (though one of Guardiola, Mourinho or Ancelotti are likely to overtake him at some point).


**Kenny Dalglish-** Most would call Dalglish our best ever player. He played behind the striker and was the magician at the centre of all of our successes under Paisley. After his playing days plenty of incredible players have taken on the burden of his number 7 shirt, but none have ever matched the impact he had on our team.

He didn't rest after his retirement from football and was hungry for further success as a manager. His chance came after the retirement of Joe Fagan (he deserves his own entry really: served the club for decades as a coach and won a treble in his only full season as manager). He dominated domestically, winning the league 3 times and the FA Cup twice in his six seasons during his first spell as manager. His time as manager was cut short by the Hillsborough Disaster. Daglish took on more responsibility after the disaster than any one man should have been able to. He was determined to support everyone who had been stung by the tragedy, and he attended a large amount of funerals in the weeks after the tragedy, including four in one day. The stress of his incredible actions and the burden of Hillsborough proved too much for Kenny, and he resigned the season after the tragedy. His actions during this time are likely to result in him becoming Sir Daglish in the next few years.

true,TheMemo,cnty-uk,Bristol,"&gt; Been there, done that, and yes it is extremely tiring, but it is an exceptional circumstance that you can't base your life on.

For my generation it's not an exceptional circumstance. With ever increasing medical advances and the seemingly increasing capability to prolong life no matter the quality, most people aged in their 30s or younger *will* have to look after an elderly relative for several years at some point in their lives. Especially as good-quality nursing home or residential home care is now unprofitable, and NHS services are too overworked to deal with the sheer amount of oldies already. Already here in Bristol there are simply no more residential places and no more NHS staff to look after any more people, and no money to employ any more care assistants and nurses. As a result, oldies are neglected and wind up in hospital, blocking beds for serious cases.

&gt; Yes, civilisation, but what kind of civilisation has half the population working to support the other half who don't work? Why don't we all just work 20 hour weeks and share the load? Hmm!

That's an exaggeration and even if it were not, I would welcome it because I'm not callous. The less time we have to work, the more time we can spend on other more stimulating pursuits - and, at some point, that may well be me without a job for whatever reason.

&gt; There will always be jobs for those who truly want them.

Fewer and fewer. As I said, productivity is decoupled from employment. Forever. You may keep your head in the sand about what that actually means, but I choose not to - I capitalise on it by providing automation solutions to businesses so that they don't have to employ any more staff.",0,1376430144,null,0,false,0,cbn46zk,t3_1k9n5e,t1_cbn46zk,t1_cbn1ihg,null,1429840425,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;Liverpool are interested in Willian (who is keen to move to the Prem League). Whether they get him is another matter but they do want him.

Bale (if he's here) will inevitably want to drift around the pitch. Siggy will swap with him if Bale drifts inside and play on the wing. Also possibly switching with Lennon when that happens. He's been groomed to play the left wing spot so he can switch there is he needs to.

Now about our new signings? A lot of people think Paulinho is a starter for sure, yet I don't think so. It was so painfully obvious last season that we had trouble breaking through a team that intended to sit back and defend. With a midfield trio of Paulinho, Sandro, and Dembélé we lack the killer pass that can tear through a parked bus. Gylfi and Lewis will play the AM in the 4-3-3 and thread passes in behind the defense for our pacey wingers to get on to. 

Paulinho will rotate with Moussa where they will both play the box-to-box midfield role. With Dembélé's history of hip problems, he'll need to be rested often and Paulinho is perfect to play in that spot. Maybe Paulinho wins the starting spot from him, but as of now, Moussa is our CM.

Then what of Capoue? Well for starters, he's much more defensively minded than any of the other midfielders mentioned. His versatility allow us to play him in center defense if need be but he'll mostly be in rotation with Sandro.

I think a lot of people forget that we can't just rely on the starting XI to play in all our competitions.

true,defnoodle,null,null,"I wasn't expecting LFC to challenge for champions league this season. Hopefully BR and staff do for the defense and rest of midfield what they did for the offense last year and this transfer market. Revitalize it, trim wages and players and  give the youth and fringe players a chance to make an impact. I don't think our offense is set, but all the guys will benefit and improve from getting a regular run of games for at least half a season. A ""proven"" player we need could be someone we already have but just needs a few more games. Of course the Suarez drama is messing with that idea, but the general thought remains.

If we're as aggressive with the defense as we were on the offense we can expect Skrtel and Coates to leave and one of Johnson or Enrique to leave. Kelly and Wisdom will be used more and there will be more squad rotation in general. Of course there will be mistakes and goals leaked, but by the end we'll know what we have. I think Allen will be groomed more to be the focus of the midfield in games Gerrard doesn't play. I can see Assaidi gone, and Suso depends on how his loan goes. We will then buy to plug holes and seek a backup for Lucas. If we bring in experience and a little more offense by next summer we'd be in shape for a run, if we bring in youth, it'll be a while longer.

All this is still within the timeframe that BR and Henry set when BR got the job. They talked of building up youth and smart transfers. These things take time. I know glory is appealing, but I'd rather do it the right way. Rodgers has talent for getting the best out of his players.

I know that Brian McDermott seems like a nice guy and, considering what he says when he brings just about anyone into the fold, is determined to surround to club with ""good people"" but from what I've seen so far (Nuremburg game aside - I swear that was the most unfriendly friendly match I've ever seen) they play like a bunch of gentlemen.

While this is good for the old disciplinary record, I actually like to see some raw aggression from the players, especially when a lad from the other team goes in hard on one of ours and the rest of the Leeds player run up and start shoving him in response.

I always think back to the first season back in the Championship when this was an occurrence in just about every game. Swansea home, Forest away, handbags swinging and arms windmilling. That's what I like to see!

true,comradewilson,present,Super Frank,"&gt; How are we acting like children? I literally came over here because I was interested in the response of Chelsea fans to this article. Frankly, if we're going to talk about childishness, you can look at the thread that I linked in my post above; it's literally pointless complaining about a thread in our subreddit, where we discussed our opinions about the Rooney saga. Nothing in that particular thread was ""laughable"" or irrational. Some of the opinions might have been misguided, but frankly, that's all they were: opinions.

Talking shit about Roy Keane as a United supporter is pretty fucking childish, especially if it is about something he said concerning a transfer. 

&gt;You're assuming that it was people from our subreddit that were giving downvotes, but from what I can tell, nothing has been particularly downvoted like crazy, and even if it was, downvotes are anonymous - they could have easily come from members of this subreddit. Moreover, downvotes aren't ""against the rules of reddit"", there are no rules. It's just a form of etiquette.

When I edited my post I was decently into the negatives. Downvotes are not against the rules of reddit and I didn't say that, **downvote brigades** most certainly are and subreddits have been closed for doing it before. 

&gt;I just don't understand how you could dismiss something that people say because they're ""united fans"" as if we're a different species to you. We're exactly the same other than the team we support, and by and large, we have the same behavioural patterns. As it stands, I encourage you - and any other Chelsea fan on this subreddit - to take a closer look at /r/reddevils[1] . We're actually a pretty good subreddit that tries to facilitate mature discussion on a range of topics; from detailed post-match analysis to general transfer rumours. There's no need for animosity between mature fans.

Except for the fact that we support two completely different clubs culture wise who both have consistently fought for the title in Europe and England recently? Why on earth would I want to go to any other club's subreddit, especially United who I dislike immensely, and talk to people there? This is reddit. People act like little shits consistently, I have to deal with it enough on /r/soccer.

true,ibaldwin1993,,Hendricks and tonic with a slice of cucumber.,"Just as a thing, ""Road Tax"" was abolished 1937. You now pay Vehicle Excise Duty which is linked to its pollution emissions rather than road usage. The Highways Agency, funded from central government which pools nearly every type of tax you can think of, is in charge of [major trunk roads,](http://www.highways.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Highways_Agency_Network_Map_-_November_2011.gif?9d7bd4), of which most do not allow cyclists. Then every other road is maintained by the local council. 

So if you pay council tax you are paying for the roads. So get the fuck off of the motorist high-horse about who owns the road.

true,Kambei1311,null,null,"&gt; Talking shit about Roy Keane as a United supporter is pretty fucking childish, especially if it is about something he said concerning a transfer. 

Talking shit about Roy Keane? Have you even looked at the thread? Most of the comments don't ""talk shit"" about him even a little bit. The only one that *really* was: ""Piss off Roy."" was the most downvoted comment. Everyone else was just saying stuff like ""Berba + Rooney combo. Fulham 2014."" and """"Sell him to fulham then"" Had me dying of laughter.""

Most people on our subreddit have a lot of great things to say about Roy Keane, but we've noticed the trend of him - since he left United - having nothing good to say about us or the manager. A lot of the time we *disagree* with his negativity, but to be honest, there's nothing wrong with having an opinion.

Of course the ""you've got to lose to win"" comment is going to make sense to Chelsea fans. You *want* to buy Rooney, so logic that would facilitate that transfer is something that you'd endorse. To United fans, however, it just seems paradoxically inconsistent. Rooney leaving for Chelsea isn't a lose-win situation; it's a lose-lose situation.

&gt; When I edited my post I was decently into the negatives.

Not true. According to RES, you have 10 upvotes and 4 downvotes. Your comment was: ""Quite a few are acting like disrespectful shitheads."" There's nothing elegant about your comment. It wouldn't surprise me remotely if a couple of Chelsea fans on this subreddit downvoted your comment, and frankly, I don't see why you're whining. It's literally four people. That's nothing.

&gt; Except for the fact that we support two completely different clubs culture wise who both have consistently fought for the title in Europe and England recently? Why on earth would I want to go to any other club's subreddit, especially United who I dislike immensely, and talk to people there? This is reddit. People act like little shits consistently, I have to deal with it enough on /r/soccer[2] . This is not the pub where you have nice discussion, this is a message board full of shit heads and children and bandwagoners who only care about downvoting what they disagree with.

Seriously don't know why you're getting so worked up about this. You might want to go to our subreddit because it's an interesting way of surveying how fans of a specific club are reacting to certain news. I often check out the subreddits of other teams to see what their fans think. You can't get that on /r/soccer. Be it Real Madrid's subreddit to see how they feel about a potential Gareth Bale transfer or Arsenal fans reacting to the lack of transfer news: it's interesting to know. Moreover, a lot of subreddits are really well run - I think /r/reddevils is one of them - and it's interesting to know how to improve the level of discussion on other subreddits. One of the things about /r/soccer which I think is disappointing is the lack of discussion about actually *football*. Too often it descends into gossip about transfers or circle-jerking over something funny that Ibrahimovic has done. I think at /r/reddevils, we really make a concerted effort to discuss football and tactics and the nuances of a certain play etc. We might not be experts at it, but we're trying. I think the level of debate on our threads has improved drastically over recent months.

Overall good performance from Liverpool especially in final third looked dangerous.

When you pay your TV licence only a relatively small amount of that tax goes towards news and educational programming, the majority is spent on nonsense like Eastenders and Dancing on Ice. Now I have no problem with these programmes being popular, but no one can claim tax funded soap operas are a democratic asset and be taken seriously.

BBC News is regarded as high-quality across the globe, but I'm not sure that is really true of the majority of their airtime. The majority of the daytime bulletins, BBC Breakfast and all the regional news broadcasts are condescending, uninteresting and shoddy. They don't give a proper analysis of the news and tend to rush the headlines in time for their top priority... the sport and weather reports. BBC News at Ten, Newsnight and some radio programmes are of a higher quality and seem to be the reason why BBC News gets so much praise.

Even without a particularly in-depth study we can see that the majority of the BBC would be profitable, we can see this with BBC worldwide already. Even 'The Sky at Night', which looks like a very niche programme, gained significant interest from private channels willing to host the show.

true,LatersOnTheMenjay,lfc12,,"I started following when the team was purchased by Fenway Sports Group. I casually followed soccer for a while, but really started to follow LFC since, as a Boston guy, I wanted to see what they were all about. Needless to say, I was hooked since them. Now I bleed red, and I idolize Steven Gerrard like the God he is (sorry Robbie Fowler, I know you're the real God). Then to learn about the storied history and the influence of great managers like Bob Paisley and Bill Shankly has been awesome. 

The most memorable games of the past 20 years: 2005 Champions League Final is considered by some to be the greatest soccer game ever.  Check out the highlights on YouTube. They're absolutely incredible to watch. I would also check out the highlights of the 2006 FA Cup Final against West Ham. Steven Gerrard played incredibly that day.

Speaking of which, Steven Gerrard is one of the most professional players I have ever had the pleasure of watching. Not only is he an incredible player who can blast one from 40 yards out into the top corner, but he is also the definition of a true leader. There is a reason why he is considered the talisman of LFC. It's incredible to see him inspire the entire team to play as well as possible.

In short, this is a great team to support. Please look in to some old highlights. Check out compilations of Gerrard's best strikes. Read up some of the history.

true,AFellowOfLimitedJest,eng-kent,Kent,"HS2 is expected (by the Government, at least) to cost around £43 billion, with 330 miles of track. Musk (although, again, many others disagree) believes that the entire Hyperloop system, covering 354 miles, will cost $6 billion (£4.5 billion). The Hyperloop will have a top speed of around 760 mph. The top speed of HS2 is expected to be around 250 mph.

These are the factors which Musk himself set down to compare modes of transport with the Hyperloop:

&gt;Safety

The Hyperloop is practically a completely new mode of transportation, not just a sped up train. It has been designed from the very beginning by one of the brightest minds of our generation and in collaboration with the best experts that his private money and the nature of his organisation provides. Perhaps crucially, the initial design stage is open and informal (I personally find the way it has been presented to be one of the most fascinating things about the project) - ideas from everyone can be explored (but, naturally, vetted and checked with the usual scientific rigour). There are many flaws currently with the safety of the Alpha Hyperloop, but the open nature means that these can be addressed swiftly.  

**Tie** - current proposal is not safer than HS2, but it has the capacity to be *much* safer than a high-speed rail system. 
 
&gt;Speed

Top speed: Hyperloop - 760 mph, HS2 - 250 mph.
Average speed: Hyperloop - 598 mph, HS2 - not found.

**Hyperloop**
&gt;Cost

Cost per mile: Hyperloop - £12.7 million, HS2 - £130.3 million.
*Note: Calculated with the total government/Musk prediction divided by the track length - not a true indication of the cost for each mile.*

**Hyperloop**

&gt;Convenience

An only-slightly more expensive version - $1.5 billion extra - of the Hyperloop (still far, far below HS2) will allow it to carry vehicles as well as passengers. Aside from that, they're basically the same.

**Hyperloop**
&gt;Weather immunity

The Hyperloop is a single system; a tube which is immune to wind, ice, fog, and rain. HS2 would be British train - I don't think much more needs to be said.  
**Hyperloop**

&gt;Power

Hyperloop - 28,000hp or 21MW, HS2 - 16,000hp or 12MW.

**HS2**

&gt;~~Earthquake resistance~~

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Go ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^away, ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^bot.

&gt;Disruption to those along the route

From the Hyperloop document:
*Even when the Hyperloop path deviates from the highway, it will cause minimal disruption to farmland roughly comparable to a tree or telephone pole, which farmers deal with all the time. A ground based high speed rail system by comparison needs up to a 100 ft wide swath of dedicated land to build up foundations for both directions, forcing people to travel for several miles just to get to the other side of their property. It is also noisy, with nothing to contain the sound, and needs unsightly protective fencing to prevent animals, people or vehicles from getting on to the track.*
  
**Hyperloop**

I'm clearly in favour of Hyperloop, so this quick summary isn't intended to be an objective (or technical) or overview of the two options, but I should point out that much of the estimates for Hyperloop are clearly not going to work out, especially the cost, and comparing the proposed systems in the different locations (especially considering solar power generation) is not ideal.

I should also add that I'm only in favour of the idea Hyperloop over HS2, and this isn't an indication of my opinion on the need for such a system and the suitability of its creation right now. Like Elon Musk, I'm rather hoping that we'll have some form of teleportation soon enough that will end all of this talk, even if that dream may not be feasible.",0,1376442951,null,0,false,0,cbn8mh4,t3_1kb6p3,t1_cbn8mh4,t3_1kb6p3,null,1429838358,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,froshster,present,Fernando Torres,"First off, the Arsenal bid didn't trigger his release clause, it merely required Liverpool to notify Suarez of Arsenal's interest.  A buyout clause is an agreed sum in a contract that forces the parent club to allow communication with said player with any team that triggers the buyout clause.

An example are the two Bayern signings, Thiago and Goetze.  Goetze had a firm 37 million euro (?) buyout clause, so Bayern secretly triggered the clause and held private talks with the player, so it came as somewhat of a surprise when the news broke of the final transfer.

In Thiago's case, he didn't play in over 60% of Barcelona league games, so his clause was only 17 million.  If he had played over 60% of the games, his clause would have been over 40 million.

Simply, these clauses allow teams to start talks with the player simply by biding the fee in his clause.  Here, the parent club is powerless to reject the bid, and can lead to good business by the buying club (Goetze and Thiago were both bought somewhat cheaply thanks to their clauses).  However, a contract extension by a player can lead to renogotiation regarding wage and buyout clause price, most recently with Gareth Bale and (supposedly) Luis Suarez.

true,MetaCrisisTen,null,null,"David Tennant (duh, just look at the username). Most people say 10 is their favourite and they have righteous reasons. It's true that you never forget your first Doctor. My first Doctor was Eccleston, and he has a special place in my heart, but Tennant is still my favourite. 

For one, Tennant has such a wide emotional range. He goes from end-of-the-world panic one episode to light-hearted comedy the next week, which takes talent. He is also very emotion in the makes you cry sense of the word. Arguably the most human of the regenerations, Tennant lures the audience into his life and gives them a chance to see what it's like for him. Though some argue that the Doctor should not be so human and should be more alien, I argue that throughout the span of Ten, we see (to the greatest extent) the toll of saying goodbye to companions over a span of 900 years. Loss and sadness are so evident in his eyes, and being able to identify with his emotions makes him so likeable. While others do this, Tennant does it the best. 

Also, Tennant was a fan of Doctor Who when he was a kid. Growing up, he wanted to play the Doctor, and his playing of Ten and living out his fanboy fantasies is something that fans can admire. Matt Smith admits to not having seen the show prior to auditioning and this is such a downer. It makes it seem that he doesn't care, the antithesis to the feelings of fans who reddit on stuff like this :/

Smith has had many wonderful moments on DW, as has all of the Doctors over the years. I loved the way Eccleston portrayed Nine as a angst ridden soldier after the time war. I loved Smith for the many emotion packed speeches he has delivered. Hartnell's take on the Doctor was the catalyst for the entire canon. Davidson's new take on the Doctor with a soft side was revolutionary and with Baker's take on the role, took DW in a completely new direction. (I could go on for much longer, but no one wants to read that rant/pouring out of the fangirlness.) Having established a love for many of the Doctors, I still think that Tennant is the best. He opened the show and welcomed the audience into the Tardis. Along with great writing, Tennant's Ten is just... the best.

If you can give a more complete picture of what happened it looks better than saying nothing at all. What you're talking about is getting nitpicked in court over times.

I'm only suggesting you tell the truth if it exonerates you, not that you give a chronological breakdown of what happened.

Channel 4 do all these 'controversial' documentaries which are basically just reality TV shows wrapped up as education. Stuff like 'My Gypsy tree faced wife' or something. Some of the 'Dispatches' stuff can be OK though. 

Channel 5 doesn't really show any documentaries at all. They sometimes have repeats of some of the better Discovery Channel ones, like Ice Road Truckers, which is alright, I suppose.

There is nothing on the level of 'Planet Earth', or the Louis Theroux documentaries on any other channel.

I would agree that generally the Spanish club may and likely will decide to start negotiations with the foreign club, but they don't have to and that's the difference.  So whether we met Costa's release clause is simply an irrelevance (my original point) as it's non-binding outside of Spain.

If you're being stopped and searched, just give up whatever you have that's illegal. They're going to find it anyway, and they might be able to use their discretion to just give you a street caution, which immediately becomes a spent conviction and therefore doesn't have to be disclosed to most employers.

If you're a motorist, make sure you're all legal re: tax, MOT test, insurance, and condition of your vehicle. Driving like a nob, not wearing your seatbelt etc is probably going to result in a ticket, and there's probably not much point arguing with the officer about it; they'll just find more things to fine you for. Follow the appeals process if you really didn't do it.

If you're actually arrested, the ""real"" advice to anybody in any country should be to get legal advice if you're that worried about it. For minor offenses, police in the UK have a lot more discretion than police in the US, so ""don't be a twat"" goes a long way.

A ""double pivot"" is a two-deep midfield in which both players have some of the ball skills of a regista. They obviously can't both be full-on registas, or the midfield would be porous; they're usually more versatile/complementary, especially today with players have greater versatility overall (see Alonso/Khedira for Madrid). Said double pivot is typical of the 4-2-3-1, Benitez's Valencia were the pioneers in this respect (Albelda and Baraja). It meant a move towards more possession-based play.

My feeling about the rivalries is that Everton is like your brother that you HAVE to do better than, but actually you get on quite well with away from  it all. In fact, most of the time, everything is quite cordial, and there is even grudging respect from the fans to each other. Both sets of fans are quite similar, at least inside the city. EFC fans would argue than people in the city support EFC, but in fact its probably about 50/50 around the city as a whole.  Some families are even split depending on parents or other family or friends allegiances. Crowds for LFC v EFC games typically have some mixing of the fans, which is almost unheard of for other European football rivalries. You certainly wouldn't see that in London or Glasgow.

With Man U on the other hand, the rivalry between the clubs has mutual respect, but the rivalry between the fans is more focused on the differences between the fans - Manchester is split more noticeably between red areas of the city (Man U) and blue areas (Man City). I'm not sure families can combine red and blue as easily as on Merseyside. As a city, Liverpool seems poorer and more working class than Manchester, and this is reflected in the stereotype of the supporters. LFC fans resent Man U's recent successes, Man U fans resent LFC's success of the 70s and 80s. Although it doesn't happen now, apart from the occasional idiot, there did used to be chants on the Kop about the Munich air disaster - not LFC fans' finest hour - and there still are chants in some sections of the Man U support about Hillsborough and Heysel - likewise. Clearly these things do not endear you to the rival support. You will never see mixed crowds watching LFC v MUFC matches.

Privately, both clubs have been very supportive of each other through Munich and Hillsborough, but this isn't widely acknowledged by supporter in the stands. Also, both clubs and both cities are more similar than most people would want to accept, with significant industrial and social influences, albeit from dock-workers and logistics in Liverpool, and from weaving and factories in Manchester.

In summary EFC is like your little brother who you publicly ridicule, and who you MUST beat at every opportunity, but secretly you hope they do OK (just not anywhere near as well as you).  MUFC is the kid down the street who you really don't like, and who you think is a bully (but it might go both ways!), and so you MUST beat at every opportunity, and you MUST let them know how much you don't like them.

That's my personal interpretation, but I'm sure it probably varies between some fans.

It follows that perhaps paying to be on Sky is a reasonable investment to make sure that content that people already pay for via the licence fee, is available to them in a practical manner.

You say that ""Even if they are not broadcast via Sky people can still receive them."", but that isn't always true. Not everyone has an aerial to get Freeview, not everyone can get Freeview, and if they've already got Sky then for the BBC to deliver an equivalent service to them they'd have to make investments in Freeview or Freesat - and PVRs for either service are not cheap.

If the BBC wants to stop paying Sky then perhaps people who cannot receive the BBC without significant investment should be allowed to claim an exemption from the licence fee - they cannot receive it, why should they pay?

true,sdtp,cnty-england,Southern Fairy,"Well as I'm sure both you and I know, you seldom stumble into something on the internet that you weren't intending on finding. It's unlikely you're going to accidentally wander down some dark alleyway of the internet without requesting to be sent there. It's not as if random hyperlinks are booby-trapped (excuse the pun) to send you to porno websites; kids type that shit into google. 'Sexy naked ladies'. 'Naked sex'. 'Porn.com'. C'mon Cameron you OBVIOUSLY know this.

You're more likely to stumble into porn when pissing about with your mates in the woods than you are to stumble into porn on the internet, and more importantly, you should be prepared by your parents to deal with that.

Back in the day when wolves were about, you explain to your kids 'Hey kids, there are wolves about. They can be dangerous but only if you provoke them and don't stick to the rules.' Same applies now. When your kids are old enough to wander the wilderness of the internet without adult supervision, they're probably of the age where they're going to start getting a fleeting interest in sex. I know I had Britney Spears posters in my room when I was a kid and it damn well wasn't because of her music. And you approach the situation appropriately, presuming you've already had 'the talk'. 'Hey kids. You may have already seen, but on the internet, there exists a thing called pornography. You know how Hollywood makes films out of stuff that isn't real? Well it's kinda the same as pornography. People make films of sex, but they're not real, and they don't represent real life sex. It's just for entertainment and you shouldn't take it seriously because it isn't real. It's like a fairy tale.'

Or,  you know, you could block everyone else from seeing it too. That way you don't have to have that 'awkward conversation' with your kid. Heck, you don't even need to *have* a conversation with your kid. You could just get the ISP blocks on and plonk them down in front of the TV with a GameBoy and an iPad, safe in the knowledge that you can get pissed and chat to your mates on Facebook without your kid ever being endangered by le grand terriblé: porno. Yeah, because *that's* where the issue is.

A ""traffic enforcement camera"" is a different thing entirely, and has nothing to do with speed. Most commonly, they watch junctions and fire to capture evidence of anybody running a traffic light after it's turned red. Sometimes these are combined with a speed camera function - one camera watches a busy junction, and can ticket you for either going too fast on a green or for passing the red. (Or both at once!)

Traffic enforcement cameras are getting more complex in cities though - some now watch yellow boxes at complex junctions (you are supposed to keep yellow hatched areas clear of queues by not entering until your exit is clear: these cameras are particularly vicious, if you stop moving inside the yellow box, £120 fine), and some watch bus lanes to stop private cars travelling in them.

Some private car parks, particularly urban supermarkets, now use a form of their own traffic enforcement cameras - ANPR (automatic numberplate recognition) cameras make a note of every car going in and out of their property, and anybody who overstays the maximum - say, 3 hours - gets a fine in the post.",0,1376469346,null,0,false,0,cbnftm5,t3_1kc49f,t1_cbnftm5,t3_1kc49f,null,1429834929,11,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,11

true,cypressgroove,eng-sussex,bRightOn,"Okay, I'm not sure how this comment's going to go down but it strikes me one of the unspoken crimes here is that they're forced to take to the streets to sell what they want to. That makes it more dangerous, and I have some first (or second) hand insight here as I have a friend who accidentally became a pimp.

Wait, wait, bear with me - it's not as ridiculous as it sounds.

Quite a while back he got into a very open relationship with a gorgeous girl who he fell in love with almost immediately. A couple of months after they started dating she revealed she was on the game, and what's more she was very clear she was doing it because she liked the money and loved sex so wasn't going to stop. Now, I remember at the time how he was hit pretty hard and, I'm not going to lie to make myself sound better, our other friends and I all balked at the idea and were (at the time) all for him dumping her.

But instead he decided he cared about her too much to do that, so he offered to keep and eye out for her while she worked. I don't know how he felt back then at the start but I do know that somehow between them they made it work.

I'm unclear on the timeline here as we only catch up every so often, but as I understand it, his gf talked with other working ladies and before too long he was 'looking after' about 5 ladies. By 'looking after' I mean he and his gf rented a house (in an amusingly respectable area actually, but I digress), he would take calls for her and the other ladies, arrange appointments, and always be available at the end of the phone when they were working so that he could strongly suggest clients who were 'trouble' leave the premises forthwith. At some point along the line, it became more profitable for him to do that full-time than it was for him to hold down a 'normal job' (PS I believe he's actually registered with HMRC as self-employed, although the details of his job are obviously nonsense, he does pay taxes, as does his gf).

Anyway, point being, I've spent quite a bit of time round his place over the years (not like *that*, although I would now see no shame in it if it were the case) and spoken to the ladies and every single one of them does what they do because they want to (and they love the money, obviously). It's such a **huge** contrast to the way I had always seen the game portrayed on TV and film that it's really changed my view on prostitution.

I always used to believe that across the board prostitution was exploitative, objectifying and disenfranchising for the women involved. However, if I were to tell any of these ladies that they were being exploited, objectified or disenfranchised they'd pretty much punch me in the chops and tell me to get off my high horse because they are in control of their own lives thankyouverymuch.

Now, ""*anecdote, anecdote!*"" is the reddit rallying cry at this point, and you'd all be right. My *one* anecdote doesn't paint an accurate picture of prostitution worldwide, countrywide, heck, even town-wide. No, the reason I'm relaying it here is because it *can be* illustrative of how it *can* work when the people involved are decent, honest people who are doing what they are doing because they *want to*.

That's not to detract from the many women who are *forced* into prostitution against their will - and that's certainly how this newspaper portrays the situation in hull. I just find myself very leery of accepting that as fact without hearing from the ladies involved directly as my experience suggests a reasonable number of women who are on the game *choose* it over other, less profitable, often even more soul-destroying low-paid work in the legal sector. And why shouldn't they, if they are comfortable doing so? 

Bodybuilders don't get this stigma for selling *their* bodies - and often they'll be putting their health at risk daily with roids or other supplements, and I'm sure some of *them* are only doing it because they realised early in their lives that their best professional asset was the one they were born with. Yet when women decide to do a similar thing, they are stigmatised and people act like it's the last resort of a desperate person.

Anyway - I've digressed a lot but my main point is whilst I think it's *bloody awful* we live in a society where the poorest are being starved to avoid the slightest discomfort for the rich, I absolutely despise that prostitution is being portrayed as purely the last resort of desperate people rather than the life-choice which it is to many who participate.

A debate has already been scheduled.for 2-3 weeks time, but it would certainly keep up the pressure if the numbers of signatures continued to increase.

For those who don't know, The Times had one of their journalists killed while cycling last year, that's why they launched this campaign. They have commissioned a report from the all-party parliamentary cycling group, called Get Britain Cycling, with a whole series of recommendations which they are now trying to get the government to put into force. 

The PM has already announced some response- there's to be a new planning requirement that councils make all new junctions cycle safe. They've also announced a funding package, about 50p per head for the next three years. Unfortunately that is a paltry amount, current funding in England is about £2 per head, the report recommendation was for £10 per head, and in the Netherlands it's £25 per head, a level of investment which has been ongoing for decades.

Hopefully public backing can persuade the government to take some serious action.

2. If being arrested is a possibility, be passive and calm. They're human, and they're scared you're going to go off on one. Don't give reason to believe you're going to go off on one.

3. If you are being arrested, ask for a lawyer immediately, and keep asking until you get one. If you have been arrested, the police are no longer your friend. They arrested you, so they're biased in favour of getting a conviction. You need an advocate, someone on your side who knows what the law is and knows what they can and cannot do. Until the lawyer arrives, stay calm and be physically compliant in accordance with rule 2.

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"**Notes I took during the game** (numbers in brackets are shirt numbers).

1: Archer: Competent in goal and utilized commonly in back passing, the team often went back to him. Stopped an early 1v1. Conceded to a penalty.

2: Fredericks: Leads the defensive line and tries to spring offside traps. Defensively sound but not much going forward.


3: McQueen: Weak in the air but times his tackles well and is quick

4: Gallifuoco

5: Ball: Drives forward from the back very confidently creating space. Picks his runs well and has a decent long pass on him. Dembele in CB. Poor reads defensively meant the CB's let the striker slice them, but he got back with some brilliant tackles. 

6: Stewart 

7: Falque

8: Carroll

9: Coulthirst

10: Kane

Goal 1 well worked. Shaq ran deep on the left and cut it back to Carroll who crossed to Falque on the back post, Falque controlled the ball, beat his man and slotted home. 

Goal 2 very well worked. Midfield trio one touch passing unleashed Kane 1 on 1. Shot stopped by keeper but spilled to Falque who slammed it home

Goal 3 Chelsea gifted the ball to Kane who slotted home easy.

Goal 4 from pressing deep, they tried to clear from corner post and it fell to Gallifucuo who found Kane (who hit the post). Shaq tapped in the scraps


Playstyle.

Defensive highline. Defenders split with wide men charging forward. Mcqueen quite poor losing it more times than not. Fredericks not very ambitious but very dangerous when he does choose to come forward. Left side certainly offensive minded (think Danny Rose) whilst the right side is very safe (think Dawson).

Midfield, form many triangles and unlock the front 3 via one touch passing. Wide men force width and Kane drops in to help with one of Carroll/Bentaleb.

Front. Completely dominant. Kane is probably beyond this level and Falque certainly is. On top of that Shaq can muscle in ",0,1376474324,null,0,false,0,cbnggxl,t3_1kc8m5,t1_cbnggxl,t3_1kc8m5,null,1429834626,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

Obviously I wasn't being literal. I'll rephrase it as 'You can kill people, but you may be punished.' Now, whilst there may be some legitimate cases where you can kill people without being punished, you'll usually want to avoid it - just like exercising your 'right' to silence.  I really don't get how you can call it that though, because most definitions explicitly state it is 'the protection given to a person during criminal proceedings from adverse consequences of remaining silent' which blatantly isn't the case in the UK.

It's absolutely insane that something you **don't** say can be used against you. Oh, you were in a traumatic event and could barely talk let alone remember important details? Doesn't matter, enjoy having it used against you.

However, aside from many [valid criticisms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention-deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_controversies) I do think that a significant part of this is the medicalisation of what may be considered slight deviations from normal behaviour. To quote Ken Robinson from his TED talk:

&gt; ""If you sit kids down, hour after hour, doing low-grade clerical work, don't be surprised if they start to fidget. Children are not, for the most part, suffering from a psychological condition. They're suffering from childhood.""

I appreciate his was mainly one of rhetoric but he does raise valid points about how we treat children bothas parents and as a society. How much of what may be interpreted as ADHD is depression brought about by forced conformity? 

To suggest we simply drug children in to submission is rather distasteful and sets a worrying precedent. Child not behaving? Quick get them drugged. Moreso, when (probably) middle class parents where both are working and stressed with their own lives don't take much time to actually spend time with their offspring. 

I say this last part from the perspective of a recent parent who has seen how many parents, particularly when young seem to drag their kids from pillar to post and act somewhat surprised and angry when the kids aren't engaged, happy and smiling. Anecdata though it is I do wonder if the change in environment and society is more indicative of the issues we see in children than the labelling of behaviours as a pyschiatric problems.

There are always going to be people who just can't get along with the rules that the rest of society impose, we should accept that and also the fact that the consequences of this are people in prison indefinitely.

On the other hand there isn't any reason why someone who does not wish (or is capable of) conforming to those rules should be locked up with nothing to do but contemplate their navel.   There are plenty of things we can think of and I don't mean chain gangs for these people to do; we outsourced how many call centre positions again?

Should they do it for free?  No.  NMW and tapped at source for PAYE/NI and a minor surcharge for 'rent' to help offset the brunt of the costs to keep both them and us safe from each other.   Anything left over they are free to spend as the rules of the institution allow or save or give to family on the outside. 

Any violent offenders or people who can't even deal with the harsher and stricter rules of being locked up... there is always the more traditional navel gazing option and the knowledge that they are at the bottom of the food chain... even in the klink.   Which in and of itself may help that person to improve their lot with in the confines of that system. 

Naturally any that show they might be able to rejoin society at large can have a tag put on, monitored and checked for a while until they're free; well as free as the rest of us at least.

true,NotBaldwin,somerset,West Country,"&gt; • A default 20mph speed limit on residential streets. 

I genuinely don't understand how this will actually help this movement. I mean I can see that lowering a universal speed limit might make the drivers that are too impatient to slow down and wait for a safe overtaking point have to do so, and I also understand that getting hit at 20mph is a lot better than getting hit at 30 mph. But at the same time its just going to cause widespread resentment and frustration from motorists.

The entire point of a speed limit isn't to reach it; as a motorist you need to only go as fast as it is safe to do so. This is especially relevant on country roads when coming up to a cyclist with no overtaking available due to oncoming traffic, as it often means a drop in speed from 50~70mph down to 15~25. 

Surely a widerspread teaching of the need to dynamically control speed as a motorist would be more effective than battering down a speed limit in cities that is only going to cause the majority of motorists to huff and puff about it? I understand that at 20mph there is more available reaction and braking time, but if someone isn't paying attention already then they're still going to have a collision.

Navas will wing some much needed width to the team which is something we lacked in abundance last year. That could also see Scott Sinclair get more of a run out as well, as having only one wide players in a 4-3-3 doesn't make for a balanced system.

What about people who can't be stopped?

Rehabilitation only works if the offender wants to change their ways. For many people, crime is a way of life. How do we reach these people? How do we make someone *want* to be rehabilitated?

As a Police Officer I come across these people on a daily basis. Second, sometimes third generation unemployed. Not because there are no jobs, but because they're literally unemployable. They fund their lifestyles through crime, they re-offend because it's all they've ever known. They grew up in an environment where crime and violence was common place.

Trying to change these people means changing their personality, removing years of ingrained experiences and fundamentally altering the way they think. It would be like deprogramming someone who's been brainwashed.

Alright, I genuinely thought you were just taking the piss out of the post, I'm sorry. Have an upvote and let's talk about this one sensibly. I like to think /r/uk is more intelligent and polite than the rest of reddit.

Lots of people cycle outside of London - and it's so much cheaper than a car, or public transport, that it's hardly the domain of ""poshos"".

I'm a student. When I went to university for the first year, I struggled to afford trains home, let alone the three-figure city bus pass or constant taxi fares. It seemed like common sense to take my economical old car out there... but it dragged me into big debts. Running the car got me massively overdrawn, and then in absolutely classic denial I started overstretching credit cards too, thinking it'd all calm down in a few months.

It did not calm down. The money ran out, I had to admit there was a huge problem, and I had to face facts before I got evicted.  
Despite the fact that I thought I'd just keep the car for occasional long journeys, I'd ended up using it around town constantly - quick trip to the shops, running too late in the mornings to walk, avoiding taxis and buses, etc. With fuel over £1/litre those really add up, and it's difficult to decline each individual trip when it's raining and the car is right there.

Living without a car that was bankrupting me was the best thing I ever did. Without the ridiculous expense overshadowing all my other outgoings, my overdraft is almost clear now.  
And multiple, reliable stats tell us 60-80% of private cars on our roads - even the motorways, the long-distance network! - are travelling less than five miles. I know I used to, and any motorist who remembers all the *I just need a pint of milk*-type trips will agree.

So now, I ride a bike around the city, from the suburbs to the centre and back again. Sometimes clean across into the opposite outskirts, and on to the next towns after that. It's really easy, I'm a little unfit to be honest.  
Not a 'posh' racing bike. It's *very* secondhand, it's from 1984, it has three gears, it's heavy and slow and I love it to bits. Her name's Sophie and instead of frustration, journeys have a little sense of adventure now.  
And I'm happier, slimmer, more likely to be on time. It's the only cheap way of getting around without spending half your day walking. 

Loads of people in this country want to cycle. Loads and loads of ordinary folk. You only have to look at the A303 on a bank holiday weekend and count bike racks to realise that it is something a wide range of us enjoy. Ordinary cars, with inexpensive bikes.
But with costs of *everything else* getting totally out of hand, people don't want to just ride for fun - they want to get to work, the shops, social occasions without the backbreaking cost of fuel and the constant traffic congestion. Petrol is approximately £fuckoff.59/per litre at the moment, diesel is even worse, and those prices are never really going to fall again. Parking's a nightmare. Insurance and maintenance costs a fortune. Rail fares went up by some outrageous inflation-busting figure yesterday. People are spending too much of their income on the commute that gives them an income.   
But they are terrified of taking their bikes onto the roads, keeping the dream inaccessible. And motorists don't like sharing with cyclists either. 

Cycle paths aren't for poshos. Done right, as this petition calls for, they let ordinary people spend less time behind the wheel: feeling safer, and costing the NHS far less because they get regular exercise. Good infrastructure stops people's family members ending up under lorry wheels, that's the sobering truth we are dealing with.

You say it's impractical to ride &lt; 5 miles from the suburbs. That's because the main roads you currently see are hostile to cycle on. Imagine a bike path connecting up the back streets - five miles is nothing on two wheels. With safety from traffic, young and old alike are free to access the town.

Maybe the problem is you've never ridden a bike designed for everyday use? Mountain bikes are horribly impractical. I got mine because it has an enclosed no-mess chain, gears that don't go wrong, loads of room for luggage (even the weekly shop), built-in lights, a nice upright riding position... It doesn't demand Lycra. You just get on and go.

It's perfect. More people deserve the ability to get out of the traffic and move that way. The price of fuel geniunely scares me for the future - civilisation depends on its transport - and it's getting to the point where cars are unaffordable.

No matter how fit you are you'll still kick up a sweat peddling everywhere. 

That is honestly a matter of pacing yourself and getting a practical bike like I mentioned, not a balls-out TdF-wannabe racer or a Halfords mountain bike. Anybody will sweat pushing as hard as they can, but with a surprisingly counterintuitive amount of experience, you start to be deliberately gentle on hills and it's no more strenuous than walking. Honest!  
If seriously concerned about that (eg: job interview), really bad hills are usually short enough to walk anyway, then you can carry on.

Besides which, it's not just London where things are close together - I live in Southampton, where the five miles quoted is enough to eat up everything you could possibly need to get to, from the city centre to the supermarkets to the ferry docks to the station to the hospital to the airport. And pretty much all the suburbs as well.  
My parents live in a rural Sussex village with an appalling bus service and only scary main roads leading away: pretty much classical 'get a car or gtfo' anti-cycling territory. Every house has one car per person.  
But on closer inspection, there's a wide, dry dirt track leading directly through our woods - emerging in a park next to our nearest town centre. I don't think I'll ever see it happen, but even out here in bumfuck nowhere, a bit of tarmac and maybe some streetlights down that track would make it practical for all the village to pedal a couple of miles into town. When improvements like that are so easy, more crowded suburbs are begging for new links and attention. 

Basically, in the rest of the UK (apart from places like the Highlands), it's closer than you think! Our population density is absurdly high and things do tend to be close, unlike many other nations.

true,I_am_a_Kite_AMA,logo4,,"To hear Pellegrini was going to take over the manager role was crazy. After seeing what he did with Madrid and Malaga in the champions league I have full confidence that he will push the players to their full potential. Our squad looks incredible on paper and with the signings of Navas, Fernandinho, Jovetic and Negredo, I have no doubt that the new players will fit right in with Pelle's formations.

I can see Pelle playing in a 4-3-3 formation, utilising Navas on the right wing for the extra pace with Milner as a backup. Last season our main attack was through the middle, often lacking creativity. Navas is the perfect fix for this solution, his pace and width on the field will hopefully allow for more space in the centre for Agüero/Silva/Yaya/Jovetic to work with.

The only worry I have so far for this season is a backup centre-back for  Nastastic. Lescott has been looking woeful in preseason and Garcia just lacks pace and strength at cb. Boyata showed confidence in his preseason game, although I think that City needs a defender with experience to cover for injuries.

Agree with this - Arthur's seat more panoramic and gives wider view of Edinburgh's context but Calton Hill is impressive as you can wander around it and get view of all the stunning parts of the city while you are really IN the city - which affords a more involved view than Arthur's seat.

The fact you are looking straight down Princes Street makes it great at dusk/night too.

true,Limited_By_Anxiety,null,null,"It is a generalised comment about this subreddit and special needs; the fact people consider special needs and mental health the same thing is concerning. The comments posted in this thread about people with special needs make sweeping generalisations that are unfounded. As I dislike (and know the limitations of generalisations) I recognise my sweeping statement does not apply to every poster in this thread. However the many of the posters that have expressed their opinions could do with spending a little time with people with special needs. 

Right now the budgets to support these people are being cut very deeply and real harm is being done to a group that already suffers, for example premature deaths for people with special needs run at the same rate every year as the total number of premature deaths from the North Staff’s incident but it just is not an issue and rarely gets reported. 

I’m sure that you, along with many here, will just dismiss my statements but advances in medical science mean that more children with disabilities survive that did as little as a decade ago and although there is still a high attrition rate many will go on to live longer lives. The chances of any person having a child with special needs that will live into adulthood has greatly increased over the last twenty years whilst budgets have been cut. Many of the posters in this thread will not only be more likely to encounter a person with special needs but also have a higher chance of having a child with special needs. 

So I’m happy to challenge the prejudicial opinions that has been posted just as I’m happy to engage people when I’m out in the community with the people I support as I’d rather challenge attitudes with the slight hope I can get people to question themselves rather than just be apathetic.

I apologise for the long reply to your post but I needed to say that. But I have worked in this area for 20 years and yes I'm a rather unique person although given the way society works that is not a positive thing.

Whether or not they think logically about that or simply default to BIKE! I MUST PASS! seems quite hit-and-miss, but hopefully that'll be a teething problem that eventually goes away with wider 20mph motorist experience.

I do wonder if a grid of average speed cameras might be a good idea, otherwise the 20mph zone can and will be ignored (or worse, filled with bullshit traffic calming - like width restriction kerbs that block bikes and home-delivery HGVs alike, or speed bumps that increase fuel consumption/emissions dramatically and wear out expensive suspension assemblies... as well as very effectively 'calming' our emergency service response times) - but it'd be enormously opposed.

Why, though? Who's going to admit to wanting to defy the 20mph limits *where children are playing*?

50mph average speed cameras seem to have found universal acceptance on motorway roadworks. Speeding there is orders of magnitude less risky than speeding on a residential street.

Oh wow, I'm sick of this bullshit. You've got to be fucking kidding; as if VED discs are a 'right' to use the road.  
It's a **public** highway - they are a tax on engine emissions, not on access to the centuries-old public rights of way. Roads existed before cars, you know. Lots of low-emission cars pay £0 for their disc anyway!

I used some public footpaths last week and I've used some pavements since, do I need to submit my Pedestrian Tax too? How about horses? Or sheep and cattle being driven down country lanes by farmers?  
At what age do you propose children's bikes become liable for Road Tax? Or indeed, Pedestrian Tax? The roads cost orders of magnitude more than those paltry discs raise. The money comes from all of us.

Local roads are paid for by council tax and grants. Trunk roads come from general national tax (everything from income tax to VAT). As ipayroadtax.com will explain to you, road tax hasn't existed since the thirties -

&gt;“Entertainments may be taxed; public houses may be taxed; racehorses may be taxed…and the yield devoted to the general revenue. But motorists are to be privileged for all time to have the whole yield of the tax on motors devoted to roads?  
Obviously this is all nonsense…Such contentions are absurd, and constitute…an outrage upon the sovereignty of Parliament, and upon common sense.”

I'd personally rather the driving test becomes a damn sight more difficult with things like overtaking maneuvers being strictly criticised, as well as dealing with cyclists on the road. I'd also be in favour of people re-taking their driving test every few years also with the aim of this bringing down insurance premiums as well as improving driving skill.

I know that this may be somewhat of a 'in a perfect world' argument, but simply hammering a 20mph limit is basically saying that enough people are that bad at driving that we must, as a nation react not by raising the driving skill/awareness bar, but lowering the capability requirement bar.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I know the path you mean. It's fine for a mountain bike or hybrid or cycling to get somewhere but personally I wouldn't use it, there are a number of reasons for this:

* When you're coming out of Dorking towards leatherhead it's not obvious that it's even there until it's already started, it's a shared use pavement coming out of Dorking I believe?

* Most people come on to it via Ashcombe Road or from further South, for the next few hundred metres (from Ashcombe Rd) there are 3 or 4 junctions which require you to give way where you wouldn't have to if you're on the road.

* From there to the Box Hill roundabout it is a decent facility (albeit with some places to give way) but it's only 1km (2 mins at road bike speed) before you have to somehow negotiate a three lane roundabout from the pavement on the wrong side.

* It's quite thin in parts, not enough space for a bike and one of those double buggys for instance.

* I've tried to use the cycle path coming the other way, from the big roundabout outside Leatherhead coming south towards Box Hill too but because of the trees at the side of the road there it was unusable because of leaves and large branches which would be cleared off the road.

What it all comes down to for me is that I cycle to go fast, it's not a tool to get me from A to B in comfort, I'd love some decent cycle paths where I don't have to worry about cars but the way things are at the moment I'd rather have the inconvenience of cars than the ones on the current system of cycle paths, in most instances.

To chalk it up as ""the fans convinced me"" after disrespecting the fans and the club for the majority of the summer just seems like an empty reason. This whole thing just shows how desperate he was the entire time to leave, and when interest from clubs we were actually willing to sell to didn't come around, he pulled his 180 degree turn and wants to stay.


Again, I WILL support him and I want him to be happy here, but all this does is give management extra time to plan for post-Suarez life should we fail to make top 4 this season.

true,vibrate,australia,Ex-pat in Australia,"A few reasons some cyclists run some red lights:

a. It's safe to. A lot of the time the red light is there because cars cant safely merge with cars. However cyclists can often merge safely with the traffic if it is light.

b. There is a gap between the lights changing and the cyclists knows that this is the safest time to cross the junction.

c. It's safer than staying stationery at the side of the road if there are large articulated vehicles behind you

d. They are cycle couriers and DGAF

This isn't condoning it, but I think it goes some way towards explaining why some cyclists do it.

I used to do it at Clapham Junction - I knew the light pattern so well, there was a gap when I could safely take the right turn without having to battle for space with car users - I did it out of self preservation. I'm sure it pissed off some drivers, but the number of dangerous, oblivious car drivers out there meant that I went to extra lengths to protect myself from them.

true,Ivebeenfurthereven,cnty-uk,"Living by the sea [Southampton via Sussex, Southsea and Swansea]","Ah, now this gets interesting and I'm going to have to critically examine my own views for irregularities: I was totally agreeing with you in this thread up until this point. But I'm very much dead-set against those boxes, I think they are the devil, and I'd almost prefer not to have a car at all.

a) Safe driving - something fundamentally lacking today - used to dictate driver discretion; not treating the speed limit as a target, but as a flexible quantity that changes according to conditions. This idea is preserved in the single-track lanes that are national-speed limit signed - so, technically, 60mph is legal.  
Now, a few of those on wide, open moors are safe to traverse at 60 on a sunny, calm evening with dry tarmac and excellent visibility. A few of them, with overhanging hedges and blind bends, are scary at 15. It requires judgement, skill, and local knowledge to determine a safe pace.  
How will the box interpret that? Will tearing around those blind bends at 55mph be marked as 'safe'? Conversely, will the notoriously opaque insurers set an arbitrary 'minor road safe pace' like 40, and on long hilltop straights (60mph!) you will now get higher premiums for averaging 45?  
The box is blind to local conditions. The computer has no idea of your road's characteristics, let alone the weather you experienced (what if fog was forecast for that general area, but you are in a clear patch? - how will you prove you had good visibility?)

b) They can and will be hacked. This applies to everything electronic that restricts people. A cottage industry of false GPS measurements, modified chips, and temporary removal at MOT-time will spring up. 50cc mopeds for 16-year-olds are in theory required to be limited to 50kph (about 35) - removing the limiter is incredibly simple, and therefore, popular. Nobody gets caught. There's some argument that vulnerable bike users are safer with the option of using a burst of speed to get clear, although that's not a discussion I will pursue here.

**c) Fundamentally my biggest problem with these.** They were championed by insurance companies. Do you really believe that they did that to improve *safety*? No. Their primary obligation is the shareholders, and they are investing in profit-generation devices.  
A promise is made to the customer of potentially lower premiums, and the quote looks attractive. But once some telematics data is in, I bet everything I'm worth that they start saying:

- Hmmm, looks like you spend time on fast single-carriageway rural roads. Statistically, they are very dangerous. Your premium has increased in reflection of this fact.
- Many drivers choose to stay in after sunset. However, we noticed that you have been travelling as late as 11pm and even after midnight. Statistically, these times are very dangerous. Your premium has increased in reflection of this fact.
- We anticipated your usage of the vehicle would be mostly local to your residential address. Despite your low annual mileage, we notice that you have occasionally been travelling far afield within the UK, and since these visits are not regular we assume you are unfamiliar with those areas. Your premium has increased in reflection of this fact.
- On 26/12/2015, your vehicle was observed parked overnight at xxxxxx. According to police statistics concerning vehicle crime, this area is notably higher-risk than your residental address. Your premium has increased in reflection of this fact.

Don't you see? I'm sorry if I sound tinfoil-hat. But these people are trying to make money and anything that deviates from the absolutely stereotypical, nuclear driver will be used to achieve that. Think about it - they said it'd be *cheaper* for safe drivers, but who has so far been offered a refund for safer-than-expected motoring after the box was fitted? The prices are only going one way.

If similar outcomes aren't happening now, I guarantee they will within five years of these boxes becoming widespread (not just among young users). The potential for profit is just too great.  
I don't see how all this is *less* contentious than a bit of average-speed enforcement in residential streets. Personally, I will pursue telematics-free motoring for as long as it exists.

Oh, also, a private company having a database of *everywhere I ever go and precisely when*? That sounds pretty sensitive.

Meh. It *can* save fuel but it will lengthen commuting times especially if you want to avoid gridlocked main roads. I can see how it will make cyclists less paranoid if a driver has more time to identify them as a potential hazard.

&gt; Access for all schoolchildren to cycle training. 

This is what I ask the Education Secretary, Michael Gove. How is this *not* on the school curriculum yet? I feel like this (as well as popular foreign languages and I don't mean FIGS and how to keep yourself safe from people like sexual predators) should be taught from secondary school, if not earlier.

&gt; Better road surfaces and junctions. 

Just what we need, more roadworks, temporary traffic lights and construction workers mysteriously absent (every time I've walked, rode or driven past roadworks, I seldom see construction workers, and that's at varying times whether in the morning, lunch, early afternoon etc.)

I do agree the road surface especially on smaller roads is fucking dire but at the rate it takes us to even dig a hole in the road and do maintenance work on pipelines, I can see this culminating in months if not years of torture for motorists. 

&gt; Widespread segregated cycle routes.

I agree with that one. It would be far better than throwing down tonnes of awkward speed humps and hazardous chicanes everywhere.

you're probably wrong (I say probably because Iv not read too much about the effects)

Its my understanding that when the average speed of congested traffic becomes low the start stop nature of it makes it worse.

By asking everyone to slow down you can actually help movement, resulting in a smoother/safer arguably quicker commute for everyone.

But even if you are right - we are talking about towns and cities which are normally a few miles from end to end. A slow down in traffic is hardly going to effect most people commutes more than a few extra minutes.

What it will result in though is a nicer environment for the general population.

I can certainly see how avoiding any direct mention or discussion of race can have a pernicious effect in that hiding those thoughts protects racism from the public view and in so doing allows racism to survive.  When I say that ""such words are not worthy of our use"" and ""I will not perpetuate their use,"" I am referring specifically to the category of slurs which includes Unerwünschte, the N-word, and the F-word (not fuck).  I absolutely believe that a frank conversation about race should be ongoing in a healthy community, **and** that terms respecting the humanity of all involved in that conversation should be the terms we use.

Your comment also touches on the repeated failed attempts in history to move past an insidious belief merely by moving the language away from slurs created by the insidious belief.  Examples include:

* the LGBT movement in its infancy adopting ""gay"" as a positive alternative to ""homosexual,"" where now gay is often used as a slur (some times for those annoying Harley riders)
* the repeated attempts to find new words to express objective mental retardation, only to see those new words become insults (idiot, imbecile, and moron were all originally clinical terms for the mentally retarded, and now ""retard"" is an insult as well)
* the ongoing historical pendulum for describing the mainstream American political left swinging between ""liberal"" and ""progressive"" as the favored or vogue term, the other having become pejorative

...Point being that tackling harmful beliefs takes more than just a change in the language -- on that point you are absolutely right.

*    staying in an NHS hospital and your treatment is carried out by the hospital dentist

He might be in for some stick on his return from suspension but after a couple of goals and good results I bet everyone will be back to singing his praises.

For me, while he's out there playing for Liverpool, I'll stay behind him.  He's done some terrible things to the club and supporters but he's still a Liverpool player and he's our best player.  While he's here, he's going to play.  If he's playing then he needs our support on the pitch.

Suarez the player has done incredible things for us in the past few seasons.  Suarez the person has done some serious damage.  It seems weird to separate him like that I don't mean to absolve him of any responsibility for his deplorable actions because that's not the case.

I also think he's going to leave next season, top 4 or no.

At Porto AVB liked using one traditional winger and one inverted winger to cut in and take shots.  Bale is obviously the best choice for the inverted winger.  Assuming that is the case, who would end up on the left is going to be a big question this season.  Anyway, since one of the wingers is moving inside more often than not, it falls on the full back to overlap and provide an outlet on the flank.  When he pushes so far forward, the CBs move slightly wide and the DM hangs out just in front/between them.  Generally only one FB will be overlapping at a time, but whichever one isn't will still be pretty far up the pitch.

In the middle, there is the DM already mentioned.  One of the other two is generally going to be a box-to-box midfielder like Dembele who can help out defensively and offensively, linking the two in transition.  Paulinho is also ideal for this role.  The third midfielder tends to do much more offensively, in more of a CAM role.  Gylfi and Holtby could both do very well here.  However, a second box-to-box type can also be extremely effective, and we will probably see a lot of Sandro/Dembele/Paulinho.  With two box-to-box mids they need to figure out when to get forward and when to cover each other, but it is also likely AVB will designate one as the more attacking position before the game, at least until they get used to the system.  I could talk about this a lot more but its already getting pretty long..",0,1376491969,null,0,false,0,cbnk5lb,t3_1kc9w6,t1_cbnk5lb,t1_cbnhwdd,null,1429832837,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

Well, I think non-City fans don't tend to appreciate the pride we take in some of our more dubious records:  the only club to both score and concede 100 or more goals in the same season.  Relegated having scored a record 84 goals.  The only reigning champions ever to be relegated.

We also still hold the record for the highest ever home attendance in English club football, but we're more eager to laugh at our failures, because our sense of humour is weird at best.  I doubt you will, but you could easily include Glauber Berti as a club legend despite having only made one appearance for the club as a substitute, or even Alan who also played at the Etihad once (for Red Bull Salzburg), both of whom were cheered on with vigour more befitting the likes of Colin Bell, Billy Meredith, or Peter Doherty (the proper Peter Doherty).  We started the inflatables trend in the 80s because we had a player whose name sort of sounded a bit like ""banana"" (if you squint your ears a bit), and to this day we still bring non-racist inflatable bananas to big matches.

All the above earned us the popular title of ""everyone's second favourite club"" until 2008, at which point we became pretty widely reviled.

As for the current situation, we seem troublingly low on self-destruction.  We've got a calm and measured manager, working for calm and measured executives, signing calm and measured players.  I'm not sure how I feel about it.  I like the drama and calamity, but the suggestion seems to be that we are looking to be professional and efficient - to churn out results without training ground bust-ups or bathroom fireworks - essentially the suggestion seems to be that we will be a drab, colourless winning machine - a rainy and grey micro-Barcelona *yawn*.

As for the squad, it's hard to know what our formation will be.  The only real constant in preseason is that we've had a concrete slab of four men at the back, and a swirling amorphous six-man blob on top (under Mancini we were pretty fluid up top, but there's hardly any semblance of shape under Pellegrini so far).  

In terms of the starting personnel you'd probably have to call it a 4-2-2-2.  So, the back four with Yaya and Fernandinho ahead (I want to call it a double pivot, but it's been working more like a javelin), then a couple of creative types bobbing about all over the shop, and a pair of strikers (typically one getting a little more involved with the creative pairing behind him, but not necessarily).  There's so much depth in the squad that giving a first-choice XI is pretty futile once you get to the 4 most attacking players - it's all *very* interchangeable.

I think the forgotten man of the squad is Jack Rodwell.  He's not getting much attention, and opposition fans still seem to think of him as a defensive, cautious, sideways ball kinda guy, so I think they'll be surprised when they find him running at their defenders, taking men on, and making himself a nuisance in the opposition box.

Also the industry of Milner is well known, but people seem unduly fooled by the Englishness of his name.  Milnandinho can and will pull out tricks and send people the wrong way with a touch of flair, and with his form in preseason don't be surprised to see him keeping players like Navas, Jovetic, and Nasri on the bench from time to time this season.

Trouble is, that's not really the common interpretation of the phrase.  [Wikipedia's article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction), for example, kicks off with:
&gt; Science fiction is a genre of fiction dealing with imaginative content such as futuristic settings, futuristic science and technology, space travel, parallel universes, extraterrestrial life, and paranormal abilities.

[The OED](http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/science-fiction?q=science+fiction) suggests it's a mass noun for:
&gt; fiction based on imagined future scientific or technological advances and major social or environmental changes, frequently portraying space or time travel and life on other planets.

That's not the way I've seen it explained in my area. It is *definitely not* an option to avoid custody in Durham. How can you run an honest RJ program if you're *offering* it to the offender to avoid jail - OF COURSE some of them are going to take it and then try to trick their Probation Officer into thinking they're sincere.

&gt;I am not saying never send people to prison. I am questioning whether it is the best option for most crimes. I think not.
Also, I would say that for those people, who refuse to engage etc. Civilised society has yet to find a proper solution for them....

Best option...civilised society...proper solution...

Let me give you a real world example from within the past two years from a court in Durham. I have lots of others but this is a good one. At the end you can decide what you'd do in this *real world* scenario in the absence of your best option society.

Mr B is a 26 year old repeat offender with a history of drug offences and petty theft. He steals things to sell to buy drugs. He has never been employed and has 10 previous drug offences and 14 previous theft convictions. He is currently on a Supervision Order for 12 months with a Drug Rehabilitation module to help him get free from his drug addiction.

Mrs G is a 76 year old widow living in sheltered housing for the elderly. Her main hobby is gardening.

Mr B is walking past Mrs G's house one day whilst she is in her small front garden planting flowers. Noticing Mrs G's back is turned he steals her gardening toolbox and tools and a garden gnome. Mrs G hears him behind her and see him run off with her property.

The Police are called and, being a rubbish thief, Mr B is soon arrested and subsequently charged. He has already sold Mrs G's property for £10 to some bloke in a pub.

In court he admits his guilt. A report from Probation informs that Mr B is failing to engage, has had a formal warning for non-attendance at his sessions and has tested positive for drugs at his most recent appointment. They are about to initiate Breach Proceedings due to his repeated non-attendance. They report that he has a long history of non-engagement and cannot offer an alternative to the current Order that they think will not set Mr B up to fail.

A victim statement from Mrs G says that she no longer considers it safe to go outside and has given up her hobby of gardening. She doesn't leave the house now. She is not interested in meeting Mr B for RJ.

Mr B won't engage, Probation don't have a valid solution, Mrs G doesn't want RJ. How do you handle this without the option of custody ?",0,1376495220,null,0,false,0,cbnlc4z,t3_1kc42c,t1_cbnlc4z,t1_cbnkjt8,null,1429832286,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

There's so much wrong with this that I don't even know where to start.

Being British is not linked to tax, it's an identity, a culture and a nationality. If the only requirement to be considered British is to pay British tax then every taxpayer in the UK is British regardless of their heritage and presumably those on welfare are not British.

Each British territory is essentially a protectorate, they forfeit their sovereignty for protection. So regardless of their financial status or internal laws Britain has a duty to represent them.

The Rhodesia issue was not successfully settled, we got the worst possible outcome. Ian Smith was right and everyone with any sense can see that with hindsight.

Britain shouldn't join Schengen, we'd get thousands of migrants moving across our borders without documentation. Nothing good could ever come of such an agreement. Besides, Gibraltar wouldn't be covered by Schengen if the UK joined because it's not part of the UK.

I think Simon Jenkins is just rambling anyway, he doesn't seem to make much a point.

true,TomShoe,1972crest,,"This is just a bit about the general attitude of the fans, what we think about where we are and where we're likely to be going this year. Feel free to use whatever you want, and ignore whatever you don't. I could write about City all day, so it's literally no trouble at all.  Also please edit whatever you do use, as I'm sure this is rattled with errors, and I don't want to come across as a complete idiot.

The attitude of the fans at the moment is somewhat split. On one hand, it's an incredible feeling to be considered title contenders, and many of us are just happy to be here. On the other hand, last season ended on a disappointing note for a lot of us, conceding the league several weeks before it was officially over and losing the FA cup final to a team we probably should have beaten. I know watching Wigan and United play in the Community Shield games was tough to watch for a few of us. 

This was compounded by losing our manager, which many felt was a hasty decision. Mancini was the first manager to win the league for us since Joe Mercer in 1968, and the first manager to win anything notable for us since Tony Brook won the league cup. In a lot of peoples minds, that puts him up with the pantheon of Manchester City managers, and many of us were very loyal to him. You'll here plenty of City and talking now about how they were never quite convinced by Mancini, and think Pellegrini is a definite upgrade, but not long ago they would have been laughed out of /r/mcfc for sharing those views. In retrospect, many fans have come to recognize that Mancini may not have been the way forward—though there's still unbound gratitude to him for getting us here. 

I think the appointment of Pellegrini has helped a lot of people get past their disappointment with Mancini's sacking. He seems to have quite the reputation, and we're all very excited to see what he can accomplish, especially in Europe, where we've underperformed since first getting into the champions league two years ago. There's a lot of confidence in him, though there's still also a fair degree of mystery about how he intends to accomplish what we're all hoping he can accomplish. 

Historically speaking, City has been defined by it's volatility perhaps more than any of its other aspects. We famously won the league in 1937 only to get relegated in 1938, and much of our history since then has gone the same way, alternating between great success, and depressing failure. I think that contributed to the sense of indignation many fans felt at Mancini's sacking. there was this feeling that we had something great here (which we did), maybe not as great as it could be, but certainly better than anything we'd had going for us in the last couple decades, and now the owners were going to risk that? Did they know what club they were dealing with here? 

But Pellegrini has, for at least a few of us, assuaged those concerns with promises of attractive football, title challenges, and european success, and the signings we've made have helped quite a bit too.

That being said, I know a few fans (notably /u/devineman and a few others I've seen around /r/MCFC) feel like he's just a yes man for Txiki Begiristain, our new director of football, and Ferran Soriano, our chief executive. These two fellows are *very* important, and somewhat contentious figures at the club. Both are former Barca men, and there's some concern that they're trying to turn City into a light blue Barca. But while these two figures are somewhat controversial among us citizens, their managerial appointment has so far avoided arousing the same concerns. In my opinion, he's not necessarily a yes man, he just isn't a no man. He's someone who won't fight Begiristain and Soriano on their vision not because he doesn't have the spine for it (after all, this is a man who went toe-to-toe with Florentino Perez), but because he shares the same vision.

This brings us, if only tangentially, to formation. Part of the ""holistic"" approach that the club hierarchy has been so thoroughly derided for, by Citizens and other fans alike, is the establishment of a single, unifying ethos across all levels of play, so that the U14's are playing the same style as the first team. The benefits of this are that it allows the clubs youth structure (which the owners have invested in heavily since acquiring the club) to integrate seamlessly with the first team, so we can develop the talent we need in house, rather than having to buy big names for ever. Rumor had it that Txiki wanted that to mean a 4-3-3 (further fueling the blue Barca concerns) but in the pre season so far, Pellegrini doesn't seem to have used anything resembling that yet, and no one can agree on what that might look like. Over on /r/MCFC, hardly a week goes by without someone posting a ""what formation do you think we'll play next year"" thread, and never has one of these threads come up with a decisive answer. The most popular answer is a 4-2-3-1 similar to what we played last year, but that doesn't look any more likely than 4-3-3 to me. The thing is, no one really has any idea what our line up will look like against Newcastle come monday, let alone what it will look like for the rest of the season. 

In anticipating what formation we're likely to use, we have a few things to go by. There are the formations we've used in the recent past, 4-2-2-2, 4-4-1-1, and 4-2-3-1. There are the formation's Pellegrini's used at different clubs in the past, which notably includes the last two previously mentioned as well as 4-3-1-2 and many others that he has used more sparingly in the past. But I think one of the biggest challenges in anticipating his line up is in figuring out how to maximize the talent on field at a given time. Our squad is pretty stacked with talent at the moment, and the problem with whatever line up anyone comes up with will inevitably result in ""where's so-and-so"" and ""surely you wouldn't leave x on the bench""

We've got three first team strikers, Aguero, Dzeko and Negredo, plus Jovetic who can play up front but is more likely to play in the whole, and the young up-and-comer Guidetti, who Pellegrini is known to be an admirer of (there's an Inside City video where Pellegrini mentions inquiring about Guidetti while at Malaga) behind them, we've got our attacking midfielders and wingers, Silva, Jovetic, Nasri, Navas, Sinclair, and Milner who can be played in either of these roles, or for that matter, anywhere else in the midfield. Navas plays pretty much exclusively out wide on the right, however Pellegrini has been known to favor situational width from attacking midfielders who can swing out, over out and out wingers. Surely that won't mean a player as talented as Navas is a back up option, but the alternative would be to get him to cut inside more, which doesn't seem likely. Silva fits into Pellegrini's preferred style flawlessly, as he mostly prefers to dictate things from the middle, and swing out when necessary, but he generally cuts inside when explicitly played wide. Whether that was Mancini, or just him, I wouldn't know, but I can see him doing great under Pellegrini. The same goes for Jovetic, who troublingly, plays pretty much the same role as SIlva. In the past, he's played primarily either in the hole, or on the left, and under Pellegrini, I'd expect him to alternate between the two in a given match. Silva and Jovetic have linked up well in the pre-season so far, but I have a hard time seeing them playing alongside each other regularly in the normal season, though hopefully I'm wrong. Nasri has frequently played as sort of a wide attacking midfielder at City, usually on the right, however he's been at his best, both at city and at Arsenal when played centrally, where again he overlaps with Silva and Jovetic. He doesn't tend to get nearly as wide as Navas though, so there's room for them to play alongside one another. 

Moving back into the CM's and CDM's, our options are Toure, who needs no introduction, Fernandinho, who's new, but has looked very promising in the preseason, Rodwell, who's been fragile in the past, but was performing at a very high level at the end of last season, better than Yaya even, Milner, who as previously mentioned, can play just about anywhere in the middle, Barry, who we al love, but is getting old, and was never particularly athletic, and Garcia, who's mostly just good for standing there and looking pretty, though he's scored a few great headers. It should be rarely easily to rotate tees players based on form, and fitness, but again, there's no way to get all this talent on the field at once.

After that, things get a bit more settled. Kompany and Nastasic are our preferred duo at CB. Nastasic will be injured the first 2-4 games of the season at least, but we have Lescott, who though not fantastic, is perfectly capable—it was with him and Vinny at the back that we won in 2012, with the best defense in the league—and we've got Boyata, who's still young and who many of us were skeptical of until his strong showing against Bayern recently (that tackle on Ribery was fair I don't care what you say). Kompany we really don't have a great replacement for, it's either Micah Richards, who's much more convincing as a right back, and Javi Garcia, who's about as convincing at center back as he is at CDM. I actually think Garcia could be decent for us, but his form last year was pretty bad.

We're pretty much set for Fullbacks. Zaba is probably the best right back in the league, or one of them, and Richards has the potential to be just as good if not better in the future. On the other wing, Clichy is solid defensively, even if he isn't particularly ambitious going forward. Kolarov is a bit more of a threat up front but he's hot and cold both there and in the back, so he remains our second choice.

Then, next summer we can sell him if he still wants and spend that money on CL quality players, or keep him and still sign more players to improve the squad even more.

John Mikel Obi is the player at the club who deserves more love than he gets, by far.  You want to appreciate Obi more?  Sell him.  See how the midfield deals with Ramires/Lampard and no holding midfield to speak of.  Lots of passing, passion, failed passing, but never any won balls.  He is the closest Chelsea have come to replacing Claude Makelele, and selling him right now would be a disaster without any replacement.  Which is also hard to find.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"one of the other things that was raised yesterday on one of the other boards (forget which one) is what Lewis/ENIC's plans may be.

Basically someone pointed out that they used to own Slavia Prague, invested a fair amount of fund into the team and turned them into a back to back champion and build a stadium before selling them.  Now it looks like we are investing to drive the team up the table and have a stadium in the works.  Some people speculating that this could be a move by ENIC to put the team in as attractive a situation for a potential sale.

Personally i tend to give some credence to the FFP reasoning, this would be the last summer we could spend aggressively before FFP really kicks in add into the fact that if we hold onto GB a transfer next summer (even if it is a reduced fee from what is being thrown around now) allows us to build the team and have a strong offset in funds.

Of course a potential GB transfer will always loom and seem a bit more feasible with a big ticket move for Lamela or Willian but we are also trying to push a fair amount of players (and their attached salaries) out the door that could free enough for a solid up front payment with reasonable payments down the line.",0,1376503208,null,0,false,0,cbnojd9,t3_1kczsf,t1_cbnojd9,t3_1kczsf,null,1429830792,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1
true,kde01,king,,"I don't think the 'easy thing to assume' is that the Bale deal is closed and we're spending that money already. If Levy said we won't sell, we won't sell! Levy isn't Perez. He is a businessman first and foremost, and he knows our biggest asset is Bale. He won't let Bale go unless Bale himself sneaks away in the middle of the night.

This is the last summer before FFP really kicks in, so by all means we're getting a big amount of spending in now so we can establish ourselves this year. If we don't establish ourselves this year, we won't have CL next season to attract players for less money. We'll have to pay over the odds to get players to come, and we still won't be able to attract the top talent. Invest now, bring in good players, clinch a CL spot with Bale, win a trophy, get our names out there, and then sell Bale. 

There are literally ZERO benefits to selling Bale this season. It would actually make very good business sense to sell him next season, with FFP in full force. The money from his sale would be revenue we could use to bring in new players. That's why, if the rumors are true, we want to bring Lamela in this season. He's going to be expensive, and better to get him now when our income/expenses don't need to match up than next year when we need to balance the books. 

There's also the possibility that Lewis will be willing to finance the stadium, but seeing as ENIC owns Tottenham as an investment I highly doubt he'll be lending to the team left and right. The only reason he's lending to the team now is because now is the *perfect* time to make that last push. We bring in a lot of top players, get rid of deadwood, make a run for top 4 (or top 3), win a cup, and establish ourselves as a top squad. It will be easier with all the changes in the top squads this season to make that run. Next season, those top squads won't be able to strengthen as much as they would have been this summer, so we'll have a leg up on them then, too, by selling Bale and having big money for transfers.

Crouch: We were attempting to upgrade our strikeforce, and he was mostly just a big guy who got on the end of crosses and knocked them down for VdV, Ade was an improvement on him.


Gomes: had an enormous dip in form and confidence culminating in a high number of high-profile errors (see the game v. ManU at Old Trafford from 2010-11 I believe). We brought in Friedel and Cudicini became our second choice.

King: He was King of the Lane, very popular among fans, but had a debilitating knee injury that didn't allow him to train. He kept his fitness up by swimming in Levy's personal pool all week, would lightly jog the day before games, and would play. Immediately after games his knee would balloon up to like twice its size. Retired due to this condition.


Redknapp pissed Levy off by basically spitting in the face of the club that supported him through his tax evasion case by openly courting the FA for the England job, and topped it off by bottling the season, losing a 13 point lead on Arsenal and finishing 4th, and Chelsea winning CL fucked us out of the competition.
