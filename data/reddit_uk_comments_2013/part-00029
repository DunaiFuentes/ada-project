Anyway, so I guess you don't put any stock in the idea that teams have cottoned on to our approach now?  Players aren't being allowed anything like the space they were given in the first half of last season.  The season before last we were still being called boring and defensive, teams expected to have possession against us, to be able to come out and play their game against us - they hadn't counted on the changes Mancini had made so we were able to come out and slaughter teams that were expecting more of the same.  Last season our new approach got sussed, probably around Christmas time.  We fell off the pace and went from well clear to 8 points behind.  Remember the loss to Swansea?  People saying we were finished, that Mancini should never have let the big lead fall away, and yet we're currently the champions, are we not?  Is that because Mancini can't motivate a team?  

""Too narrow!"" was the cry.  ""Wingers"" this! ""Wingers"" that!  Over the summer Mancini worked extensively on 3-5-2 a formation in order to give us attacking width, to play to Dzeko's strengths, and to get a playmaker in the hole behind our front 2.  It's done well and won us points this season - and yet when Mancini makes the switch in matches where we need to change system (which generally requires an attacking midfielder to make way for a wingback) people flip their shit because they think it's simply switching an attacking player for a defender.  It's a ridiculously naive way of looking at the sport and needlessly adds to this uninformed tide of nonsense that seems to be trying to engulf Mancini right now.

&gt; I don't quite understand your logic in blaming Brian marwood for poor transfers.

When it comes to transfers at City, Mancini along with a handful of other people decide who we want, then Marwood and co. would go and do the negotiations.  We had no problem identifying targets (as you say, Hazard, RVP, et al would have been good for us) which is the bit Mancini is concerned with, and back when Garry Cook was in charge of negotiations we were able to bring in our targets.  Marwood got booted from that role (which probably should tell you something) and replaced by a very well respected guy from Barcelona, so we'll see if things are any different in the summer.

It seems like your opinion of Mancini is mostly built from his record in a knockout competition.  Knockout competitions are as much about luck as anything else, and the specific knockout competition you're looking at is the most difficult knockout competition in club football.  How many attempts do you think Alex Ferguson had before he won it?

Above all else I think we need stability.  Despite your seemingly intimate knowledge of Khaldoon Al Mubarak's innermost desires, it has been publicly stated on many occasions that Manchester City is a long-term project.  The rapid growth period is over and we are now looking to stabilise the squad and build a sustainable club going forwards.  Terminating a top manager less than a year after signing him to a 5-year contract because he didn't win back-to-back premier league titles isn't the way to do it.

If it were a straight choice between firing Mancini but not giving his replacement the funds to make changes to the squad, or sticking with Mancini and spending on some new players, which would you choose?  I ask because under FFP that is pretty much the choice we're faced with.

true,oxygene31,1972crest,,"Agree to an extent about our style of play, we need to speed up the build up play and get the midfielders into the game, as you said at the moment the game completely bypasses our midfield because of the pedestrian way we play the ball out from defence, ie we get to the halfway line, stop, and go sideways or backwards. 

Defences find it hard to cope with a swarm of players coming at them, running into the channels, pulling the defence wide and creating space for the playmakers to pick the pass, this is what we don't do at the moment. We expect too much from Agüero and the simple fact is, that he can't do it all by himself. 

Tevez and Agüero aren't there to create, they're there to finish the chances, but the way we play at the moment, the way they have to drop far too deep to be effective, it would be easy to be misled into thinking that they are supposed to be the creators and not the finishers.

Wouldn't touch Torres with a bargepole to be honest, the guy can't hit a barn door from 10 paces, and this has been the case for the last 4 seasons. If we are going to buy a striker, it has to be someone top class in the Cavani/Falcao mould.

His creativity up there is great as well as his possession.  He RARELY looses the ball.  His vision is good as well.  When he plays on the wing its tough, he's a spanish midfielder lol.

Coutinho - TBD - seen 3 games of his ever.  Not judging yet.  This is hard for me because i am VERY judgmental if you couldnt tell from first 2 pages of this comment lol

Jonjo - No.  That's it for me here.

Allen - Wheewwwwww I would say this is the most difficult to predict.   I'm not sure if his form is making him look bad or if i should expect it.  It's been a while though.  Not a bad backup to Lucas though.

i did know a couple of australian work mates who knew about and celebrated pancake day, but that's all that i recall. i'd say it's mostly just those with recent british heritage or from strongly religious families who still know about pancake day. we really need to do something about this injustice...

Alex, 25, who has Downs' Syndrome and learning disabilities was due to be collected from Highbury College in Cosham, but was not there when his lift arrived.

Witnesses say he attempted to board a bus but did not end up getting on.

He's 5ft 2ins in height and of stocky build, with dark hair and glasses. He was last seen wearing black jeans, black jacket and white shoes. He was carrying a red rucksack and may have been wearing a beanie hat.

We're very concerned about Alex who is not road aware and may struggle to get home to Stubbington by himself.

We'd ask anyone who sees him to call us on 101 or 999.

The search will continue throughout the night and residents in the Cosham area should expect to see an increased number of police officers and search personnel in the area.

I'd argue the Doctor has that same flaw, among many others. It doesn't take much to gradually work that flaw until it totally corrupts him. Move him from one situation in which he's forced to compromise his morals for a greater good to another to another.

The main difference is the language. Every story about Syria refers to the government as a ""regime"" consistently. Contrast this to your first link which only mentions it once when it's quoting someone else. The portrayal of the incumbent dictatorships is considerably different between the stories. 

See for yourself, google ""syria guardian"", I just checked the six links google had for them in it's sub-list and ""regime"" is mentioned pretty much every time they are referring to the government. When repeated with ""bahrain guardian"" things are very different. Firstly, there aren't even enough articles for google to offer a sub-list! Of the ones listed most don't use ""regime"" outside of quotes. You need to include ""regime"" in your search to actually find any that do it a lot \(like [this one](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/17/bahrain-security-forces-sunni-foreign) which only does it twice, albeit quite prominently). As a comparison most similar length stories on Syria do it upwards of five times. Hardly a scientific study but there is definately a blatant disparity between the reporting on pro-west ""leader"" and anti-west ""regime"" dictatorships out there. 

WRT your second link, that's ""Comment is Free"" which is quite separate to the news coverage I'm talking about. They let pretty much anyone write a column and all sorts of views are represented.

It's usually calculated to take into account how much the total cost of having you sitting in the office works out as, as a proportion of the total cost of running they company.  They're not just paying for your basic hours, but how much your desk, PC, software, stationary and other materials cost.  How much it costs to heat and light the space you sit in.  How much your insurance, pension, healthcare contributions are (if you have them).  How much it costs each year to train you, or for you to non-billable time keeping your skills sharp etc. etc.  Basically they're contributing to the overall cost of running the company itself, measured by how long the job is expected to take.  Added to that will be things like your level of experience and seniority.  How long it takes you to go to the toilet is essentially irrelevant.  The company already knows how much money it needs to achieve it's profit margin and will adjust things accordingly (or at least that's how it's worked in every corporation I've been in).

People used to ask me why sometimes I would charge large amounts for work which only took a few hours.  My response was usually that they weren't paying for that time.  What they were paying for was the 20 years of experience I'd spent previously doing what they wanted that allowed me to a) produce the goods in a short space of time, and b) produce them to a reliable level of quality.

Umm... Zero? Zero times?

The Doctor's laughed at seeing a Dalek defenseless and in chains, but he's never laughed while his enemies are dying. Normally he just glowers or gets this very stern look on his face.

Make no mistake: the Doctor may seem all fun and games, but death is *never* a joke to him.

But if you're of this mindset picture this:

The Silence have one doctrine: ""Silence must fall when The Question is asked at the Fields of Trenzalore"". That question is ""Doctor Who"" and they're working to ensure the Doctor never answers that question.

But why? Why prevent the Doctor from answering such a benign question? 

Because the Question is not asking ""what is your name"". It's asking ""who are you"".

So who is the Doctor? Who is he really, what has he become? We've seen this debated before. Is he a savior, a wise man, a healer, a good man? Or is he the Oncoming Storm, the Time Lord Victorious, the Predator?

true,i_like_jam,eng-Surrey,Surrey,"Well, first of all Bahrain is a much smaller state and less newsworthy, so you won't find as many articles. To a UK national audience changes in the Syria story are higher in the agenda than the Bahrain story, which hasn't actually changed much in the last year or so - so that the story resurfaces on anniversaries, such as that of the F1 or the BICI report (November, last time Bahrain was in the news for a good week or so). 

Secondly, you're suggesting that Bahrain and Syria should be talked about in the same language as though the comparison is 1:1. They aren't. Perhaps the major difference is that the Bahrain state has not been totally discredited, as the Syrian one has. It's not a civil war situation and there are still attempts of reconciliation between sympathetic sides of the state with the opposition - the latest dialogues having been held just this Sunday in fact. The Bahraini state still retains some degree of legitimacy and I don't think this comparison is entirely fair. Perhaps you think that the Guardian should have been more pro-opposition than it was (or is). We can agree to disagree if that's the case... I've found the Guardian's coverage balanced overall and they've reported on the events in Bahrain more than other dailies (I don't know yet if they covered it the most, but they're a contender). I'm a Bahraini myself, would put myself squarely with the opposition and never had a problem with the Guardian's reporting of it (for that matter I don't think I've got a bad word for any of the papers, except in the (in)frequency which some reported the events).

Comment is Free articles are still useful to look at because at the end of the day it's an editorial decision to publish each article and to some degree a reflection of the paper.

true,weblypistol,cnty-uk,Llanfairpwllgwyngyll.... etc.,"It's more complex than that and basically goes back to the BSE affair. Yes suppliers said banning DSM would cause huge problems for cheap meat more for economy pies, pasties, burgers, kebabs and the like. But then the  FSA said [the proportion of the industry was small](http://www.food.gov.uk/news-updates/news/2012/apr/dsm#.URsGqGfDluY). No health implications seem to have been drawn but the EC decided the process of DSM was essentially the same as MRM. That is a different product in texture but essentially the same process in removing ruminant meat from bone. The risk lies in BSE and vCJD which was created by the meat industry feeding cows dead cow and so on in a bid to cut corners. MRM had the risk of spinal cord, parts of the nervous system entering the food chain. Does DSM? [Well, studies suggest 'safe' levels](http://europepmc.org/abstract/AGR/IND43781109/reload=0;jsessionid=h1uXwkhvSy3wYWQ2b6nR.6).But remember BSE /vCJD derives from prions which are teeny weeny weeny. And of course we can trust BSE and bad practices are gone because it's not as if huge amounts of bloody illegal horse meat are in our food. Now the meat industry unable to cut more corners are pressured by the big supermarkets to produce a low cost meat. And economics being a harsh mistress, the public seek the low cost bargains. Meanwhile there are long links of businesses in this market trading across Europe (DSM was produced elsewhere too) and lesser regulation generally as countries cut back. The current government accept the EC ruling because British meat products will be banned from Europe otherwise. Meanwhile everyone is pointing the finger at the foreigner, [but the UK can't hold up their head](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21434077). No one's coming out of this good. Here's two articles.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"Hard to say it's unfounded when he links to sources and quotes to back up his claims throughout the article. Also he is not criticising 'some UKIP supporters' but the members of the party who, by definition do 'represent the party'. They are the party. 

On the immigration thing it may be common sense to screen people for diseases before letting them into the country but the more worrying thing and the purpose of his point there was to point out that the rest of the policy was indistinguishable from the BNPs including 'zero net immigration' and encouraging 'assimilation' etc etc. 

It's understandable that the writer is worried about UKIP, not as you seem to imply because his party will lose influence or something but because the rise of extreme views in scary times is a bad thing. It's a natural reaction to uncertainty but not a decision based on rational thought; it's only based on emotion. 

Also the inaccuracy that was corrected was that Maggie Chapman did not advise that old people should be euthanised if they become a burden but instead she joked 'about Muslims having sex with camels and “paki” families going home and spread[ing] Christmas cheer with her “eggnog for nig-nogs""'. Those comments about Maggie had been misattributed and were actually spoken by a UKIP activist, Kim Gandy, who did work in care. Hardly a veneration of the party or even remotely close to 'showing that he just made a load of shit up'. 

Sounds to me like your dismissing the points because they come from a source you have grown to disagree with because it disagrees with you. 

If everything in this article were true would you still support the party? If yes then ignore this. Your not the sort of person the writer is reaching out to, you won't be persuaded by this. 

If no then don't you owe it to yourself and any other people you know who support the party to work out if they're true or not because if they are true then you have a serious problem your walking into blind to the truth. If you can show they're not true you can wave in front all the 'left[ies]' faces as evidence that you're right. Dismissing this source out of hand does you not good either way. Investigating the truth is the best option whatever happens and it's a win-win for you. You either avoid supporting a racist, homophobic and unrealistic party or you have evidence that you were right all along.

Coutinho - has the flash the question is whether he will ge te consistency to make it worth our while

Joe Allen - I see him becoming a Busquets style ""recycler"" who wins possession but then moves it through the midfield quickly with one-touch passing, the difference is he would have to do this further up the pitch or in tandem with another defensive midfielder because he lacks the physical presence in the defensive midfield area (at least for the BPL)

Shelvey - the wildcard in the bunch, he has shown bright spots periodically but has also been hugely disappointing at times; his biggest issue is positioning, this is something that he can learn in time with proper coaching but it is up to him on that

He was presumed lost in the act of saving his fellow researchers from said supernova. This is not true, however; he is alive(?), existing in a negative universe, (so Clara is unlikely to be him). This is a *very* closely guarded secret (only the Council of Time Lords is suppose to know about it). Thus, he is considered to be not only the father of (Gallifreyian) time travel, but a martyr to the cause.

Rassilon captured a black hole and placed it beneath the Panopticon; it powers all of Gallifrey, including all of the TARDISes.  That is to say, they all share the same power source: imagine all of the TARDISes everywhen/where sharing the same ""engine room"". And while everyone agrees that Rassilon is a genius (even by Gallfreyian standards), they all also agree that he is a massive tool (arrogant, condescending, believes he is the only one who is right about anything, and thinks everyone else are idiots because they don't see it that way), so I don't think he would Clara either.

As for being Jenny and Jacks daughter, while they are both time travelers of a sort, i don't really see that being possible, so no to that one too.

true,merlinho,wales-Glamorgan,Glamorgan,"A few years ago I phoned 3 to maybe cancel but I was open to offers. The first tactic they have with retention offers is to bombard you with information (including exaggerating by offering qualitative opinion on the specs of any new phone being offered e.g. ""Very good camera"" when it's below market average specs) so make sure you're fully researched.

Anyway, after a long discussion to this end, and me knocking back a few of his claims, I was offered a good deal: £150 cashback and a new model SE phone (this was a while back!)

After some sums in my head, this seemed acceptable to me, so I agreed. After a number of admin questions answered around start date delivery etc, he then, to my surprise, said:

* 3: Where do you want the vouchers delivered?
* Me: Hold on what vouchers, you said cashback?
* 3: Yes, cashback vouchers for £150, for Comet.
* Me: But I don't want Comet vouchers, there's nothing I need there! You told me cashback, it's not the same thing.
* 3: You could buy a PS3.
* Me: I own a PS3 already.
* 3: You could sell them.

At this point I lost my temper and demanded to speak to a supervisor. After voicing my displeasure at being lied to, they made me a better offer which I actually agreed to.

 They also signed me up to a longer contract than I was told on the phone so I had a later argument with them to resolve (I demanded that they went back and listened to the recordings which constituted a verbal contract - I presume they did as they adjusted the contract length soon afterwards).

From experience since then, I've found that they'll also say stupid stuff about your usage e.g. If you're trying to cancel so that you can switch to an unlimited data contract, they'll quote that you haven't exceeded your allowance ever so you don't need it - they don't grasp the fact that I'm capable of actively managing use not to go over the limit but that doesn't mean I wouldn't prefer not to have to.

So in summary, I agree that the 3 retentions guys are hard work!

Henderson - I think he'll make a good central midfielder in the future. Really high work rate and his distribution is good. The best part is he actively looks for opportunities to pass the ball forward, rather than turning around to play it back to the defenders.

Allen - High hopes for him, he's off form recently but I think hs's a very good player and will make a great centre midfielder or defensive midfielder in the future. From what he has shown us at Liverpool so far he doesn't seem to do very well going forward, even though his time as Swansea suggests otherwise.

Shelvey - Something is wrong with him this season, he just can't perform. But I think he might be an okay attacking midfielder in the future with the ability to blast the ball. I think he should go ahead and try to get himself some playing time on loan. He hasn't really impressed a lot, and if he doesn't get more playing time I think he'll get worse and worse.

Suso - I feel he'll make an amazing player in the future, we should try to keep him. He's really skilled on the ball but, as we all know, relies heavily on his left foot. I think he has great potential, but he needs to work on his weaker foot and his defending, people make their way past him so easily.

Good to know. If so, I suppose Gerrard might be travelling too. I was thinking Hendo + Allen + Lucas, with subs of Shelvey/Suso available, but if we're going all out on this Gerrard has to come. It's gonna suck for Suarez, didn't watch the WBA game but some of you guys mentioned he looked tired (as I thought he did against City, well, maybe not tired, just less magical - that could be a product of fatigue).  He definitely has to play for us if we do want to 'go all out' and we still need him for Swansea 3 days later.

Is this a good decision though? I think it will definitely affect our performances for the PL, and yet it would be so sweet to win the Europa League, especially with a rather messy team (without the likes of Sturridge and Coutinho).

However we studied Russia 1917-1945, Weimar/Nazi Germany 1919-1945 and Edwardian England 1895-1918 (welfare state beginnings, suffragettes, WWI changes in society). To be honest, not very much and I did think a broader range of history just about Britain would have been more interesting.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;what is so funny here is how fucking stupid you are, and how blind to it you are. truly brilliant.

Sure, that must be it. Go on, use some more *fucking* swearing.

&gt;But clearly as demonstrated by your total inability to grasp the most basic of concepts and follow a consistent point

You mean the examples you haven't addessed? I didn't realise they'd be so difficult that you'd give up at the first hurdle. 

&gt;not to mention the numerous and massively hypocritical crap you spout such as ""welcome to the world of people can think what they like""

Considering you haven't given any evidence or examples, and resort to insults instead when someone highlights how much your answers give away when you're so busy not-answering, the quote is accurate - although it's significant that you equate 'you don't get to dictate what people think' with 'people can think what they like', when the two statements have very different meanings - so maybe directly quoting might help you a bit more than you realise since your memory doesn't appear to be working too well either. You might also want to look up what 'hypocritical' means :-)

&gt; and yet going to great detail to tell me my values and views are ""wrong""

Two examples you've been unwilling to address is 'great detail' now, is it? But don't worry, exaggerating my replies into an attack on the very core of your soul is quite entertaining.

&gt;It is clearly a waste of time even engaging you in discussion

You haven't actually done that yet - do try to keep up.

&gt;as you are simply incapable of the most basic level of comprehension

Of course, it's not you, it's everyone else - blindly agreeing with your bigotry is a level of comprehension that I haven't attained yet. And I've quoted your insults-instead-of-information all the way through - you've demonstrated (again, just in the last post) that you can't even quote properly.

&gt;Consider this reply merely a courtesy to tell you, i will not be reading or replying any response to this

Ah, last word/ still no evidence - always a sign of a winner on reddit. Not that your reading skills appear to be very good anyway, considering that cherry-picking the parts you can answer and ignoring the vast majority that you can't isn't really a response.

&gt;i simply do not value what you say, or your ability to reason at all.

I guess it must be terribly annoying when you have to defend assumptions based on ignorance - especially when you don't want to comprehend that my statements are far from unique to me. But don't worry, I'm sure your pearls of wisdom in these comments will shine through to all...or at least, give them a good laugh. I suspect the latter.

&gt;I hope you do keep your views and stance and i hope you are actively open with them in society

Because as pointed out already, they're completely unique to me, right?

&gt;it will save many people, a lot of time, in determining how out of tune to reality you are.

Sure, because *everyone* automatically agrees with your assumptions - after all, you've done such a bang-up job of selling them here.

&gt;However as it seems from your ""points"", you appear of the mind that the crowning pinnacle of a successful person is being on television 

You said it tainted a career. i've illustrated how it doesn't. You've resorted to demanding a 'crowning pinnacle' Einstein-example rather than address the above. Shall we move onto Carla Bruni, who married the PM of France despite posing naked a number of times? Oh, that's right, we need to keep it to Page 3 now for your bigotry to stay afloat.

&gt;and some 2 bit bargain bucket body CBBC presenter, may i suggest you audition for big brother?

Oh dear, still under the impression that doing your best to dismiss the examples will somehow mean that actually happens. Janet Ellis - sacked from Blue Peter in the 70's for having a baby out of wedlock (who grew up to be Sophie Ellis-Bextor). Peter Duncan - sacked from the same show in the same period for appearing in a soft-core movie. Gail McKenna - does page three then has a string of  successful sporting and then children's TV presenting jobs (I guess the producers of all the kids' shows just forgot to speak to *you*). I could give more examples, but why should I? You've have two, and and failed to address them much past 'kids TV? So what?' which is not only pretty lame but ignoring the point as well. See what happens when you really don't know what you're talking about?

&gt;it seemingly has lots of people who i would consider ""like you"" both in terms of cognitive function and also ""class"", this will enable you to feel good about yourself

...on and on, still seemingly oblivious to how you've just made yourself look *even more* ignorant...

&gt;and perhaps you could commemorate your achievement with a tattoo?

...and bigoted....

&gt;then you know you have made it and can kick back as a winner, perhaps reward yourself to a holiday in ibiza or maybe butlins.

...and a social snob. You're aware of what *public board* means, right?

&gt;Ill just remind you again, there will be no encore, there will be no reply (i wont even read it btw, just straight up delete, so i wouldn't bother)

Yes, last word/ no evidence - we've already established this, but I guess it helps your memory to say it again and *still* you think I've been replying solely for *your* benefit, to the point of deleting-without-reading so that you can pretend you had the last word in a debate you were never really brave enough to join. Delete your own comments from this entire thread too if you like - my quoting you ensures that it won't make any difference.

Maybe this is because a lot of people are just going on the website and never buy print editions where news and editorial is separated? Or maybe it's because we have a public service broadcaster who's remit is impartiality so people expect all our media to be impartial?

All of our newspapers are biased and partisan and I don't think I've seen any of them claim otherwise.

There may be varying levels of 'journalistic integrity' on the news pages but, generally, even if the reporting is good, at the very least a newspaper will play up stories that fit it's narrative and play down stories that don't.

On the editorial pages you get pure opinion, targeted at the demographic that reads the paper. Whether you agree with it or not, complaining that it's biased is missing the point. This is the part of the newspaper where the editorial staff get to be explicit about their biases.

true,[deleted],null,null,"So use the aggregate to our advantage instead of pissing into the wind. Bring in very CHEAP labor from abroad so we can produce very high quality food in much more intensive, well managed operations. Abolish the minimum wage. 

Being the first country in Europe to produce 100% bio food? Along with a weak pound after the Euro fall out, means cheap to produce high quality EXPENSIVE exports.

I think we should have a conscription system that takes kids at 16 and employs them on farms for 6 months. Pays them as much as it pays its overseas immigrants ( get some context of the world) and some work experience on a publicly owned piece of land. After all if farms are to survive we need farmers. I can't think of much that would inspire young people want to succeed than spending 6 months knee deep in crap, toiling over a rudimentary thing like planting seeds, knowing you won't see the end product of your labor for months at a time.

That might sound bonkers but is it more desirable than the army? And is it just coincidence that Denmark, Finland, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland ( countries which always finish at the top of social mobility lists and life expectancy lists and prosperity lists bla bla) also have this military service at 16 or 18?

I admit some countries who do it fail to prosper as much as these guys but most of them are countries that would suffer much more without it anyway- Poland, Spain, Ukraine, Greece, Turkey. 

I think we really miss a trick. 75% of the land mass of the UK is farms........but we import more than we export.....

I am not debating the overall ethics of the scheme or suggesting she should have gone without benefits. However, if you don't need 'work experience' to get a job at Morrisons and 16 year olds can get them 'no problem' then she should presumably have been able to get such a job somewhere.

If, on the other hand, those jobs are hard to get at the moment, and an unemployed graduate cannot obtain one, then it's not fair to say you don't need work experience to set yourself apart or that 16 year olds can get them 'no problem'

I would agree that she could not have just 'gone and got a job' - *that was my entire point* - but in that case it's unfair to say that 6 weeks experience of dealing with customers and managers, while getting a reference, is of no value at all (i.e. you don't need experience and 16 year olds can get the job 'no problem').

true,Seismica,cnty-uk,Teesside,"The ignorance of the people behind these schemes is astounding. Let me tell you my experience:

I was 6 months unemployed, and put onto the 'stage 2' of JSA. Basically this means you get more help with your job search. They gave me the option to go to a 4 week training/employment skills course. I thought it would be helpful, so naturally I accepted. It turned out to be more of a CV help thing, but they did seek to get people placements on the way. By the end of it, I was offered a placement at Poundland, with the opportunity of a job at the end of the 4 weeks. I wasn't told I would lose my benefits if I refused, but it was implied that there would be 'penalties'.

So I go to the interview and everything goes well. Of course, they were just checking to see that I wasn't a complete drugged up fucktard, it was free labour so they would take anyone within reason. They offered me the placement a week or so after my interview, and instructed me to purchase my own uniform. But by this point it was too late, my 4 week course had ended.

Why was this important? Suddenly, it meant I wouldn't be eligible for the back to work placement scheme, I would be classed as doing volunteer work, which is completely different. This is because my number of hours would be more than the maximum volunteer hours, meaning I would lose benefits for Hours * Minimum wage, which would bring my benefits down to zero for a week's work. Also, ontop of the uniform, I would have had to pay my own travel costs (so £25-30 or so for the uniform, and £15 per week for travel). This meant that for 4 weeks worth of work experience, I would be losing my benefits (Roughly £56 a week), and then have to pay out of my own pocket for a uniform and for travel costs. The cost of this 4 week work placement to me would have been (4\*£56)+(4\*£15)+£25=£309.

If that wasn't bad enough, I was told that the penalties for not taking the placement would still apply.

I was lucky, because I had been accepted into University. This work placement was simply something to go on my CV, I never actually needed the job at the end of it (Unless I could get part time). I could afford to turn it down, and sign off before these 'penalties' were applied. But some people do need them. One of the guys I was with on the scheme has done two of these placements now, both at the same Poundland that I had applied to. Although he did get to keep his benefits during them, he never got the job either time. That is because there was no job, as there was another guy back at the job centre being mis-led into taking his place.

This is the dumbest thing I've heard since yesterday. You could only morally consider taxes theft if you never used anything they provide (and then it'd still be legal). Like roads, or the police, or healthcare. Or eat certain foods, use certain devices (government subsidies!). Use or participate in any form of the banking system.

Really, you would have to be a hermit on a hill who built his own home, hunts his own food and makes his own clothes to have not, at some point, received the benefits of a taxation system. I presume you're not, considering you're on the internet. So no, taxes are not 'theft'.

The dictionary defines slavery as:

&gt;a civil relationship whereby one person has absolute power over another and controls his life, liberty, and fortune

Sounds familiar. Personally, I dislike calling it 'slavery' simply because it has too many historical connotations. But 'forced labour', certainly.

I was told that there was nothing they could do because ""trespass was a civil matter"". I replied ""even if he's armed?"" ""Yes"" was the response I got before they hung up on me. Frankly, I was frightened. I had no choice but to take a note of the registration number of his land rover and stay well out of the way.

They were very kind when they realised what he was doing, and very apologetic, but the stupidity of it just amazed me.

According to BASC (Which I'm failing to link, google ""SHOOTING
RIGHTS OF WAY &amp; ACCESS

&gt;When the footpath runs across private land the ownership of the land and sporting
rights are unaltered. Therefore a person with the shooting/sporting rights may
shoot on or over footpaths on their land equally to public having the right to walk
(to pass and re-pass) along it as a means of communication. So the public and the
shooters have a concurrent right to the footpath and it is up to both parties to not
obstruct the other.

I'm not a Doctor, but I'm pretty sure if you don't eat, you die. If your only source of income is benefits (true for a lot of people), then the government holds control. They say whether you get the money (and thus food, bills paid, rent etc).

&gt;If I refuse to pay taxes I will be locked up. So by your own definition, taxes are slavery.

Did not you read the *very brief* summary of how taxes benefit you? Go back, it's only a paragraph or two. Taxes aren't slavery, that makes no sense. You could consider taxes to be immoral, as theft. But then that'd ignore the huge benefit everyone who pays them gains from them, directly or indirectly.

I can call slavery / forced labour immoral, because I in no way benefit from it. I mean I could still call it immoral if I did, but then I'd be a hypocrite.

&gt;I said doing a placement would be better than just looking.

Doing a placement cuts into your looking time. If the placement is not relevant to whatever field you wish to work in, that's a negative for the individual.

Ok, great.

But that's the nub of the issue. The program isn't designed to help *you*. It takes no consideration for your experiences, your skills, your work ethic. It just dumps you with a work placement that may no have relevance or help to you actually *finding a job*. It's also kind of negative economics, because it encourages companies to take free labour rather than actually giving someone a proper job.

Coutinho seems to be a road block for Suso, who is only a year younger. Hopefully, there will be enough cup and Euro matches next year for Suso to get games. Don't want to see him go on loan.

Shelvey needs a loan like no other. Hes not a technical or intelligent player. He can only play direct football so he should go on loan somewhere where he can perfect it.

No food, no life. This is not a difficult concept to understand. To be alive, to continue to have 'life', I must continue to eat. If I am unable to do so, if I have no food, I die. I'm not sure I can make that simpler.

&gt;and then show how someone on benefits can find no alternative way of getting food other than government payments.

[Russell's Teapot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell's_teapot). 

You would need to show that there is a way for every person on benefits to attain food, money and shelter through some other means. If a person has food from..somewhere, does that help them have a house over their head?

Because if there are people who cannot, the system has failed them. 


&gt;Irrelevant. Work placements benefit the unemployed (many are very happy to have gone on one and say it helped them land a job).

It's not irrelevant at all. That you benefit from taxes is the exact same reason why it's fine to pay them. If you received zero benefit from them, you would have a point to question 'Why do I pay this?'

Anecdotes about 'my mate Dave who said he loved doing work placements' aren't useful. I could tell you about my mate Dave who absolutely hated it. The 'benefit' you're claiming needs statistical or factual foundation, such as how many people who participated in said schemes used the skills learnt on it to gain a job? Which paper do they say they were 'happy' to go in it? Who conducted the study?

&gt;I used your own logic. How can you not realise this? The very same reason you think placements=slavery shows taxes=slavery/theft.

You made attempt to make some analogy about going to jail for not paying taxes. Perhaps you could explain in greater detail how a tax is slavery. A tax is something you are legally obliged to pay, slavery is essentially work under forced conditions and is illegal. I don't see how those two things are the same.

**Again**, yes you could call taxes 'theft'. But only if you do not benefit from them. Which you do. So, how is it theft when you receive benefits for what you've paid?

The unemployed receive no benefit from their labour, thus 'slavery'. 

&gt;The individuals on placements have been out of work for a while, so their looking evidently isn't working great.

An astounding leap of logic. Again, directions to the magical land where jobs are free and plentiful. Even so, if their looking 'isn't working great', cutting into that time by heaping forced labour on them is supposed to help how? These work schemes don't help anyone 'look'.

&gt;it is designed to help you find a job, so you are being openly disingenuous. It is designed to prepare you for work, and get you experience.

Make your mind up, is is helping me ""find a job"" or is it ""preparing me for work""? Really, it's likely to be neither. 

It doesn't help you find a job. In fact the whole JSA system doesn't appear to help you find a job. I suppose you could argue that by the threat of benefits loss, you're forced to go look for work. But the actual system does not seek out jobs for you, you have to do that as an individual. By labouring at Poundland, I'm not 'looking' for work. I'm labouring at Poundland. Any actual looking for work I do is going to be in my own time, which I will have to fit in around this labour.

If it 'designed to prepare for work', what work is this? If I have no intention of working in retail, what then is the point in putting me in retail? That is not 'designed' at all, that's just ""go where we tell you"". **Again**, you've failed to answer what 'experience' someone who is familiar with working gets from these schemes. If a person has a proven history of work and thus experience, what does shelf stacking in Poundland add to their resumé? The answer is nothing.

do you believe someone could 'control someone's' life *without* direct control over their food? 

&gt; You would need to show that there is a way for every person on benefits to attain food, money and shelter through some other means.

erm, no problem. foodbank. remember we're just talking about food, as per your definition. It's you who defined it that way, so the burden is on you to show that government is the only way people on benefits can eat. come along. 

&gt;  That you benefit from taxes is the exact same reason why it's fine to pay them.

which is exactly why work placements aren't slavery. again, your burden is to show that no one has ever benefitted from a work placement, as this is your line of argument. 

&gt; Perhaps you could explain in greater detail how a tax is slavery.

I don't believe tax is slavery. But if you believe these obligated work placements are slavery, then tax certainly is. your logic, not mine. 

&gt; A tax is something you are legally obliged to pay, slavery is essentially work under forced conditions and is illegal.

a few things here; slavery is indeed illegal whereas the governments work programme is not; so if you're maintaining the work program is slavery, you've defeated yourself. 

secondly, a tax is something you are legally obliged to pay (as long as you take the benefit of those taxes), just like a work placement is something you are legally obliged to go on (as long as you take benefits). 

Oh I just thought of one difference; I can't opt out of taxes like an unemployed person can opt out of govt money. 

&gt; Again, yes you could call taxes 'theft'. But only if you do not benefit from them.

ok, and you can call work placements 'slavery' but only if the person doesn't benefit from them. so show me that in every case, they don't. 

&gt; The unemployed receive no benefit from their labour, thus 'slavery'.

[citation needed]

&gt;  Even so, if their looking 'isn't working great', cutting into that time by heaping forced labour on them is supposed to help how? 

by giving them experience. 

&gt; Make your mind up, is is helping me ""find a job"" or is it ""preparing me for work""? Really, it's likely to be neither.

both. don't you see a connection? perhaps you've never employed anyone.

About the Marina Mandarin and Mandarin Oriental mix up; we do get it pretty often as well, since Chinese here (mainly, though other races may do it as well, this practice is most often associated with Chinese) hold wedding banquets at hotels and restaurants. Thankfully, the two aren't that far apart, and I guess you're lucky when it comes to customer service though - Singapore actually has a very poor customer service reputation, with the exception of a few places. My instinct was to actually try and tell and/or show you the bad places, but after a quick review, it just sounded plain weird. Even though I've not travelled as much as some people, I found that service in countries like Taiwan (in Taipei) and the USA (mainly in Oklahoma) were far superior compared to home sweet home. 

I'm not surprised you found Little India a little decrepit though. Depending on when you were in Singapore, it's been largely overtaken by what the locals dub as foreigners - people who come in to work in Singapore, occupying mainly blue collar jobs and jobs that locals find undesirable.

true,hotcod,null,null,"Years ago when I was on JSA I was having a hard time finding work and as part of the escalation on to the next level of scheme I had to take a maths and English test. I thought they where joking, I have A-levels in both maths and English but no, it was part of the process that I *had* to do. I then pointed to my disability statement of dyslexia, which but a few years before (at the time of my a-levels) stated my spelling age was that of an 11 year old but that my reading comprehension was greater than most adults and how that made reviewing my ability to spell utterly redundant... but no, it was part of the process, I had to do it. 

So I did do it and guess what they found? That my spelling was awful! What a shock! What was an actual shock was when they told me I had to go on a course to improve my spelling. I pointed out again that I was provably disabled in the matter and sending me on a 2 week literacy course was a waste of every ones time. But it was part of the process so I had to do it.

Turns out there was a £100 reward at the end of the course so I decided it was easier not to bother arguing and just go. You want to know how useful that course was for any one? A very *very* dyslexic person I.E me was able to be done with the 2 week course in a day and was able to sit down and pass the test on the second day (but only because they weren't set up to let me take the test the same day I turned up) and to give them their due they let me go and the JSA paid out £100 for my 2 days of hardly any work. 

So worked out well for me in a perfectly selfish sense this one time but it taught me a very valuable lesson about JSA. You are not a person and your ""advisor"" is there to tick a box not find you a job. When dealing with them you should never, ever expect a common sense exception to the rules to take place because process is process and if they've not accounted for everything (they don't even try) you are going to get rail railroaded down what ever the preset box ticking track they have laid out.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TaxPayers%27_Alliance

&gt;The TaxPayers' Alliance is a British pressure group formed in 2004 to campaign for a low tax society. The group had about 18,000 registered supporters as of 2008,[2] and claimed to have 55,000 by September 2010.[3]

&gt;Matthew Elliott[9] is the current Chief Executive of The Taxpayers' Alliance. In October 2009 Elliott admitted that another director of the group, Alexander Heath, had not in fact paid any British taxes for several years as he resides in a farmhouse in the Loire in France. Heath has lived and paid taxes in France since 1973.[6]

true,sm9t8,eng-somerset,Somerset,"&gt;I have a fundamental problem with the idea that schools should be run for profit, which is a part if the idea behind academies. The profit from education should be great students. Anything else is secondary. The ideological position of the Conservative party is so contrary to my own that I find it extremely hard to be objective and to recognise the good things they are doing.

So you're a bit of an ideologue yourself then?

Pragmatically the primary purpose of education can still be great students, despite schools being for profit.

If the practical consequences of for-profits is that education improves then we should allow it. If we don't then the primary purpose of education ceases to be the importance of students, because you've instead prioritised making the ideological point that students are important.

Whether profit making improves schools or not is what we should be debating. [Evidence](http://www.ifau.se/Upload/pdf/se/2012/wp12-19-Independent-schools-and-long-run-educational-outcomes.pdf) from Sweden suggests that it doesn't harm or benefit students in any individual school, but that free schools (profit and non-profit) do improve education overall.",0,1360770393,null,0,false,0,c8ei361,t3_18fhvi,t1_c8ei361,t1_c8eel6h,null,1431281428,-4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-4

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"&gt; So you are saying my dad giving me money for nothing is more moral than us giving unemployed people money on the condition they look for a job?

the two are not really related at all. 

My point, back at the [original comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/18fovg/ministers_extend_backtowork_schemes_despite_court/c8ef60h) is that if it is immoral to not pay someone for working, then it stands to reason that paying someone for *not* working is similarly immoral. Neither represents fairness. A worker is worthy of his wages works both ways.

What you are talking about is not ""being paid [rewarded] for not working"", you're talking about a father giving his daughter an allowance. he's not paying you for not working. he's helping you out (which I support; which is what JSA should be, and often is). 

What JSA should *not* be, (and which it can and sometimes has become and these work placements attempt to fix) is paying people for not working, or rather allowing them to be paid for not working and not trying to work or find a job. 

So if these placements are unfair (not being paid for work is generally unfair) then the other extreme of people taking money but not looking for work is equally unfair; because that's not what JSA is for.

I don't think so. The TV license is only required if your TV is being used to receive broadcast transmissions. If you've got to the point where the 'inspector' is coming round then it is presumably him who you must convince.

No.

well yes but it is hardly a fool proof system, as I'm sure you can imagine. getting the long term unemployed onto more practical courses in actual businesses is going to be a better way of gauging their efforts, whilst also giving them experience (which looks good to an employer).

true,kidkayden,lfc12,,"I think a lot will change in five years so it is hard to say who will actually still be with us in that time but I think either way we will be fine and have a top 4 team once our current youth matures a bit. 

First team (current age - age in five years):

Gerrard (32 - 37) : Gerrard will most likely have retired from the team but hopefully will have began coaching our youth setup as a replacement for carragher who I hope starts there next year once all of his coaching badges are complete. 

Lucas (26 - 31) : Lucas will hopefully still be with us in midfield but I could see him moved on already or benched for a youth to come in. He has arguably been one of our best players in recent seasons and will be a key part of us pushing on as long as he can get back to his pre injury form. 

Henderson (22 - 27) : Henderson will be first team for sure and hopefully in the peak of his career. He has already shown that he can be a boss in midfield and is good defensively as well as when attacking. I honestly feel that he could be our captain after gerrard retires if he stays in our first team. 

Allen (22 - 27) : Allen definitetl has what it takes to be in our first team in five years and would be at what is hopefully around the peak of his career. I think that he and henderson would make up a great partnership in our midfield but only time will tell. 

Coutinho (20 - 25) Our newest signing who has shown flashes over the last few seasons of the player he can become. I think that if he is a success that he would still be with us in five years just coming into the start of his best years. I am not sure if he will end up on the wing or in suarez's spot but i would like to see him coming through the center since he is our number ten. 

Shelvey (20 - 25) : Also a player who could still be very successful if he can just get the playing time he needs. He reminds me of young gerrard so much but he needs to get a level head and learn to control his talent. I could see him playing as an attacking mid but not sure if he will be in the starting team or not. 

Suso (18 - 23) : It's crazy to think that, as talented as he already is, that he will still only be 23 in five years. I think suso has everything that is needed to be a success and I think in five years we can see him in our starting eleven either in the attacking mid spot or on the right wing. 

Outside of new signings and our current reserve youth midfielders I think our 2018 starting eleven could look something like this:

true,farnz,eu,"Oxon, England","A GPS satellite uses a 25.6 W transmitter, with a 13 dBi aerial, at a distance of around 21,000 km from the surface of the earth.

The exact power available at your cigarette lighter socket varies from car to car, but will be at least 60 W (most cars handle 8 A continuous draw, but downrating to 5 A gives you margin for bad electrics), and goes as high as 240 W on some cars. This assumes that you're still using the factory wiring, and haven't fitted a higher power ""leisure"" setup (as is common in things like camper vans).

So, you can probably put out the same raw power as the satellite, but much closer to the receiver, and overwhelm it.

For a more mathematical view, a quick Google tells me that a GPS satellite's field strength is around -135 dBW/m²; that's around 3.2e-14 W/m². Feeding numbers into [this RF calculator](http://www.compeng.com.au/emc_conversion_tables_rf_calculator2.aspx) tells me that with a 0 dBi antenna (non-directional), I need to feed 0.1 µW into the aerial to get that power level at 500m. Assuming that the transmitter is 10% efficient (i.e. for every µW it draws, 0.1 µW is fed to the antenna), I only need draw a microwatt to get that signal strength. At 1 milliwatt power draw, I can get to 1,000 times the strength of a GPS satellite at 500m from the transmitter.

It's therefore entirely believable that a fag lighter device can put out that sort of power. We're talking less than a phone charger, after all (around 5W output power).",0,1360774319,null,0,false,0,c8ejabb,t3_18fsa3,t1_c8ejabb,t1_c8eewop,null,1431282005,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I think the reason McDonalds is 'tasty' is because it appeals to simple palates.  That is, it's full of sugar and salt.  However anyone with a more refined palate will of course appreciate a nice floury bun with fresh salad, homemade mayonnaise and a nice thick butcher made beefburger.  It sounds a bit arsey, the whole 'developed palate' idea, but actually most people do have fairly sophisticated palates, particularly as they get older.

There's two reasons I have a fairly strong opinion on this.  One is, last week we stopped off at the farmers market and my wife got some cherry tomatoes.  The difference between these and the (expensive) ones we buy at Tesco or whatever was unbelievable.  So much more flavour.  It really got me thinking about the whole subject.

The second is, I strongly want to support local business.  I really, honestly believe in helping out my local community and in being an active part of my local society.

This is the position we deserve with the way we've been playing:

* Promising against the clubs ahead of us
* Then undone the next with a ""flat"" performance against so-called lesser clubs.
* Dismantling another club the following week.

Inconsistency seems to be hallmark of a mid-table club and this season we've exhibited a lot of those qualities.

I've been thinking a lot about *why* we're playing so inconsistently and the answers are somewhat obvious:

* New players.
* Extremely young players.
* New manager (bringing with him, new coaches, new training style, new management style, new tactics, new philosophy, etc.)
* A poor summer window.

But the biggest issue to me is something that Rodgers has mentioned before, it's a lack of leadership (outside of Gerrard and Carragher, of course), it's a ""quiet"" clubhouse. To me this is big factor in why losses don't turn into draws, draws don't turn into wins.

We can quickly point to the youth in the squad. They're young, we say. Wait until they develop, we say. Fair enough, our future is extremely bright, however, right now? Someone has to lead the club, motivate the club, push the club, and that man has to be Brendan Rodgers.

To me, this is the biggest challenge for manager in the closing weeks of the season. Motivating a young club to continue to keep their chins up and remind them that improving on table position from last season is extremely important, that putting something in the trophy cabinet can go a long way.",0,1360775262,null,0,false,0,c8ejl4n,t3_18dwe6,t1_c8ejl4n,t3_18dwe6,null,1431282155,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

&gt;  this would mean that the signal would be readable at any point on the earth unless I've misunderstood.

You have. Your signal bounces off the ionosphere. Where it can be heard depends on many factors - the solar flux index, the frequency you're on, the time of day and even the date of year all have an effect. For example the 10 meter 28MHz amateur band is a daytime band that is most usable in summer. Where you can talk to on that band depends on whether it is daylight or not for both stations. If you were to listen on that band you'd hear not a lot until about an hour before dawn then you'll start hearing stations from countries east of you moving as the day progresses to countries west of you and then about an hour after dusk you'll hear nothing again. 

For the 20m 14Mhz amateur band if I want to talk to Australia from the UK that typically has to be done from about an hour before dawn up until around 10-11am. During the morning I'll hear mostly Asia and Russian stations. As the day progresses and it gets towards dinnertime in the UK the Americans will start to be heard.

HMRC sent us both a letter explaining that the Tax code should change to D0, i.e. tax at 40%. However they didn't do that. Hence I paid too much tax. 

Sure I could have checked more closely but they'd been doing a pretty good job for a few years and I trusted them not to screw up. Frankly until that point my payslips just got downloaded and filed away somewhere safe. I didn't look at them unless the money that hits my bank account is significantly less than I'm expecting.

Maybe the letter from HMRC got lost in the post. I didn't bother following up because by the time I found out I'd stopped working for that company and didn't need their services.

I'm not out of pocket in any way as I'd have had to pay that tax anyway so really it doesn't matter than much, it was just annoying to find out so late. If they'd been submitting more regularly to HMRC they might have realised what was happening and got in touch with me (or them).

Starting him in the front isn't the best either because we have Suarez, Sturridge, sterling and downing.

Do NOT communicate with TVLicencing. At all. Ever. You do not have to. There is no requirement to. Do not let them in. Do not phone them.

This is a good resource/forum to read: http://www.tvlicenceresistance.info

The TV License is administrated by a company called Capita for the BBC. Capita then employ salespeople that they call ""enforcement officers"" in a delusional attempt to create the perception of authority. They have no authority at all. They are just like any other sales person such as a double glazing, or other unsolicited door stop seller. Do not be misled by the phony job title.
The sales people that visit have no legal authority, and no power to do anything at all. As such they will attempt to coerce you into buying a TV license at the doorstep. They do this because they earn commission in doing so. They earn £20 per successful sale. 

The best thing to do, if a TV License sales person comes-a-knocking, is close the door. There is no need to be rude to them, nor, on the flip side, is there any need to enter into ANY conversation with them what-so-ever.

Do not let them in your property. Ever. Do not speak to them, you do not need to. Do not fear their empty, shallow, hollow threats; they have no grounding and are cowardly threats and nothing more.

To answer your question:

You need a TV license if you have ANY equipment that you are USING to receive live television broadcasts.

If you have a TV that is CAPABLE of receiving such broadcasts, but you are not USING that functionality, a licence is not required.

We're not going to make top 4 in the League, and until we've had a couple more rounds of the FA Cup, we won't know if even 6th would be good enough to get us back in the Europa next year. It's getting to that point where it looks like winning the Europa League may be our only hope of qualifying for any European football at all next season.

Also, Liverpool Football Club exists to win trophies, and it's the only trophy we're still in for so we must give it our best. A good run, and good wins against maybe Inter or Atletico would do us a world of good and keep us on the map as a team who can still mix it with the big boys. You don't get a trophy for 6th or 7th in the Prem.

So that's going to mean resting the big names in league games. Now we're back to 2 games a week, and Gerrard isn't going to be playing both and flying half way to Mongolia and back in between. Suarez, too, looks tired and it is so long since he's had any kind of rest (suspensions aside).

So yeah, you're right. Sturridge and Coutinho will play every game in the Prem, and players like Suso, Allen and Shelvey will presumably get a chance to prove their worth in those games and make a place to be playing in the first 11 in the Europa.

I was a junior in high school, my spanish teacher was good friends with Rafa and they sent each other emails almost every day. Every year during spring break he would visit Rafa with his running/teacher friend (who became my Econ and Psych teacher my senior year). They would usually go to Melwood and watch a game at Anfield or away somewhere else. That year he brought me back an autographed card of both Rafa and Alonso (i'll go scan them), and some really cool Liverpool Crest engraved napkins from a dinner he attended. My senior year my Econ/Psych teacher went again and they brought me back a This is Anfield scarf which i wear every game. From what i've been told (by my econ teacher) Senor L knew Rafa because when they were younger they got working permits with the Real Madrid academy to avoid the draft in Spain. I feel so lucky to have ever come across something like that.. It's honestly such a small world. 


Sorry back to the original story... Since the games were usually on around lunch time i would always go to my spanish teachers room to watch the game. He would find it on a stream somewhere and put in on the projector for the other 4-5 soccer fans in the school to watch. That same room in 6th period (i think?) i convinced him to put the end of the Champions League final on where i got to see Ronaldo miss a PK and cry and John Terry slip to win it all.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"That's not what i'm saying. UKIP does not consist of a majority of people who are totally reasonable and few nutters; the leadership and main members are the one's criticised and the one's spouting unequivocally racist things. Also the fact that they are denying things was not really what I was saying either though it was the writer's point. It is evidence however if not an argument in and of itself that the views are those held by racists and people who are under an illusion that the views are not racist. It is valid to criticise the people themselves because the policies are not entities alone. They must be explained by and enacted by the people in the party. People have been disliking the conservatives recently because their policies said one thing (that they weren't going to privatise the NHS) before they attempted to do exactly the opposite. The integrity of the people matters especially when they have policies that could, maybe, be interpreted as racist and then say things implying they are in fact racist. You have to interpret the policies  in the light of what they say and that's mostly what makes them extreme. 

Libertarians would not restrict immigration, would not oppose gay marriage, would not advocate assimilation, uniculturalism and the abandonment of people's culture when they move here, would not support increased defence spending or intervening in the free market to protect 'Britishness' ([11.16 in this document](http://www.castles99.ukprint.com/UKIP/Britishness.pdf)). 

They are a one policy party, namely opposition to the EU, and they have adopted the far-right ground which has become more attractive through the financial crisis. No doubt they have libertarian elements and some reasonable members but they also have very extreme elements, they tolerate disgusting people in their party and the rest of their policies are attention grabbing fixes for people's prejudices rather than actual thought out polices. If they got into power it would be chaos.

In my opinion, the first season with Smith was sorely lacking in direction and didn't develop the sense of time continuity that you get from the Eccleston and Tennant years because there was so much gap between adventures, unlike the ""okay we're done with this now on to this"" you get used to.

The reason for doing this is that retains a grater level of flexibility because, well, it's much easier to sack part time workers or people acting as contractors.

Can you honestly not see what offering free workers who come with short term ""commitments"" that can be tossed out the door at a drop of a hat might be a bad idea in that kind of job market?

2) Foster a winning mentality in the league. We can enter next year knowing we can win games, both against weaker opposition and against the top ten.

3) Demonstrate that we're a team rebounding from a tough few years, not a team who accepts mid-table finishes.


I realize  that we have a small squad, but I don't necessarily buy into the hype that team's cannot play well in the league while advancing in cups. Advocates of this theory will cite Chelsea's run last year, but I think they need to consider that Chelsea scraped their way through the CL, and that every other team who advanced far into the tournament did so without jeopardizing their league form (at least not to the extent that Chelsea did).

He is my childhood hero. I was going to the stadium only because of him. We trained together in the national team a couple of times and I will never forget these moments,” said the star of Barcelona and Tottenham.

&gt; unions who receive taxpayer support when they should be funded only by themselves

Perhaps if they were paid enough it could be possible. In general union work doesn't affect ""a select few"" and raising the working conditions for themselves echoes beyond the immediate industry. I don't think the figures are huge but I can't really comment, but seen as they have to compete with organisations like the Confederation of British Industry and ""business tzars"" like BBCs favourite Alan Sugar cosying into politics, and various other corporate centric political interfaces, the other side need all the help they can get. Not too mention the various political parties who are bought and paid for.

One example stood out in memory: [""strategic relations"" initiative](http://www.ukti.gov.uk/download/464700_182900/UKTI%20Strategic%20Relations%20list%20of%20companies%20(Feb%202013).doc.html). The [guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/jan/18/buddy-scheme-multinationals-access-ministers) calls it a multinational ""buddy system"". Amazon doesn't appear on the list but many other tax evaders do, Vodaphone was one that jumped out. That's all activity sponsored by government for the benefit of a select few. Hate for the endangered species that is unionists seems to be hate wasted. The damn unions having too much money isn't the problem.

I don't mind tax avoidance I think it is mostly used for corporate subsidies and furthering the greater military state, but people need more democratic and economic equality. Unions seem to have been able to soften many of the destructive forces of liberal free marketeers. It might be one of the things that differentiates us from US, despite what MT tried to do in the 80s. It certainly checked and is checking mass privatisation. My approach is simply to not earn enough to be taxed and never buying new products, rather than accruing as much as possible and paying a tax ""advisor"" to do what is essentially pointless work.

I'm sure you know it but the key with launching something like this is everyone that uses it sharing it with their friends, if their first experience with it sucks they're not going to come back or recommend.

The problems that currently exist with it (but not limited to):

1. The code is largely copy and pasted from tutorials and ""how to do x"" type things, for example the Javascript used to launch the overlays with each clubs information is a) inefficient b) wrong c) will break when anyone tries to use your site without Javascript enabled.

2. The website doesn't work on mobile. There are two major use cases for it, people pre-planning a night out and people already out and looking for a place to go to next. The former will have no problems because they're on a laptop, the latter however are going to be using their smartphone... and will have no way to use your website. This is trivial to do right. 

3. If someone enters a city other than Brighton the site dies with an ugly un-friendly error because whoever configured your server is leaving error display enabled, which is insecure.

Like you said there's definitely potential for this to succeed, but not with sloppy work like that. Developing a website like this is ultimately quite easy for someone that knows what they're doing, it's a simple CRUD application. Anyone worth their salt could recreate everything you have now (and do it properly) in a weekend. 

And if you have no money there's got to be at least 1 person you know or can find through university that has the skills to do it properly for an ownership stake in the business.

true,StillwaterBlue,null,null,"Long boring answer alert:
Heavy goods vehicles are, at least in theory, restricted to 56mph (90kmh) and this is done by having the tachograph calibrated by the Ministry Of Transport so you'd expect them all to have the same top speed but that's not the always the case. In older vehicles, the tacho head (where the old paper discs went) were built into the speedometer and old analogue speedos were inaccurate by up to 5-10% either way so you could find yourself creeping up on the truck in front which is annoying as you'll be in cruise-control most of the time (modern units are designed to be driven mostly in cruise). If there's nothing behind, then it's ok to overtake. If you're holding everyone else up then you're just being a dick, although some car drivers (and remember truckers are also car drivers when they're not at work) seem to think they have the god given right to get past at any cost, which of course they don't. These people are also dicks.
New style digital tachos shouldn't vary much but they still do and not all tachos are calibrated the same. Some trucks in our fleet (identical 500hp Volvo FH's) do 55, 56 or even 57mph. Some fleets have units set at 50mph for safety (ASDA I think) and some set theirs at different speeds to monitor and compare fuel consumption.
Tyre size also affects top speed. It's not uncommon for some dodgy operators to fit low-profile tyres for calibration then swap them for a set of big hefty super-singles and go out and bowl along at 60. Larger diameter tyres have the effect of ""gearing it up"" slightly. It's even possible to pull the fuse and do any speed you like but if you get caught doing that you'll get shafted by the courts and rightly so but it's common to be overtaken by (sorry, but usually Irish hauliers) going at least 70....
HGV's should only be in the nearside lane except for overtaking, which they're perfectly entitled to do, lower powered units loose a bit of steam on hills and as few roads are totally flat and all loads have different weights you'll always get a difference in speed, but as I said, if you're sitting there holding up a line of traffic for no good reason then you're just being a knob. Being a knob isn't just the preserve of truckers however and knob-like behaviour is displayed across the entire spectrum of road users. It's amazing how often I change lanes to let cars, vans, trucks, whatever enter a motorway from a sliproad only for them to just sit there at 56 and expect me to back off and move in behind them when I've done them a favour by letting them out in the first place. If I don't move over to let you in, it's because I've got someone to my right and I cannot. This is not a reason to accelerate down the hard shoulder sounding the horn and making the ""wanker"" gesture out the window at me as if I'm the one doing that's doing something wrong. Car transporter drivers NEVER and I mean NEVER back off or move out for anyone. They are wankers. Royal Mail drivers cannot drive to save their lives and are also wankers.
Oh, and trucks no longer have 24 speed manual gearboxes as my dad's old MAN had in the 70's. 12 speed automatics are the most common nowadays. Thank god. ",0,1360796306,null,0,false,0,c8er2bb,t3_18gkik,t1_c8er2bb,t1_c8eoq75,null,1431285758,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

Regarding your comments, I'd like to point a few things out. Much of the front-end code, which is visible for you, is generated from back-end code, which appears messy, but is of no way a hindrance to the website's deployment. 

Regarding your feedback:

1. The code is absolutely not copied and pasted from tutorials, but rather utilises some popular jQuery plugins - many professional websites also do this. A quick Internet search indicates that, in the USA, up to 2% of Internet users have Javascript disabled (http://www.searchenginepeople.com/blog/stats-no-javascript.html), so I don't genuinely consider this being a huge obstacle to the website's success. Again, to reiterate, much of the front-end, visible code is generated from back-end code, and appears directly in the visible source code, which does look ugly, and I plan to fix this (as it is also a bandwidth drain) with AJAX calls, but this is not so inefficient as to effect the usability of the site.

2. Regarding mobile-use, as a solo front-end and back-end developer, this is something I'm working on slowly, although I have enabled mobile-detection, and applied a different style-sheet for smartphone users; I only have an iPod Touch, and it seems to render fine and usable on this.

3. I completely forgot to disable error displaying, thanks for pointing this out.

You are also absolutely wrong about recreating this in a weekend; creating a secure, back-end CMS is not a weekend job, unless you shabbily use deprecated query calls, and don't take security too seriously.

true,wailaapoyd,null,null,"They are different to UK supermarkets (not that they are a shining example of ethics) in that they treat their staff far worse.  PRP is not a lot, and only recently have they offered this to their temporary workers since it became illegal not to.  Minimum wage is absolutely not enough to live on.  It's barely enough to exist on.  If you want a decent diet, a reasonable car to get to work, some sort of life outside work, rent, tax, etc you're already struggling.  Owning a house/having kids, forget it!  

There are many ways in which the workers are harassed and bullied.  They are routinely harassed over scores and ""idle time"" (which could be something as simple as going to the toilet, or actually taking their time to do their job properly such as not picking an item which is marked up wrongly and taking the time to report it and make sure the customer doesn't get something they didn't order).  They are given targets which they are harassed about if they don't meet even though sometimes it is impossible.  Even if they do hit the targets they are still routinely harassed about idle time, despite doing far more than the job they are actually asked to do.  They are threatened with disciplinary action if their idle time gets too high or their scores too low.  Imagine doing 120% of what is asked and still being threatened with disciplinary action.  This is bullying and exploitation.  They are threatened into coming back from break early, again with disciplinary action, loss of prp etc.  Again this is bullying.  Additionally they are treated like criminals being forced to lose some of what little breaks they get in order to comply with amazon's security procedures.  Legally they are entitled to their breaks, but they aren't allowed to take them fully because they have no way to fight back except to report the issues to their union which they are afraid to join in case they lose their job.  It's bullying!  Plain and simple!  These workers can hardly afford to take the loss that would likely come from standing up for themselves.  GMB are not throwing around the word 'bullying'; they are reporting it as what their members have told them.  Contacting your union is not something you rush to do if you are being treated fairly.  In fact, many amazon employees have been intimidated into not joining a union because they fear it will cost them their jobs.  If you polled the workforce probably more than half would believe they are 'not allowed' to join a union.  I have spoken to a LOT of amazon employees and this is a very common belief.  

Having no alternative to working for them does not mean it is acceptable for amazon to treat their workers like crap.  The very same workers whose hard work is making them massive profits, which they then dodge paying tax on.  Tax which their workers, and customers must pay.  

Finally, you should take a huge dose of salt with everything amazon says.  A lot of what they report to the press is outright lies.  At best it is usually carefully worded to disguise the reality.

true,notnotcitricsquid,null,null,"1. You're missing the point. Javascript fall back is standard practice, it's trivial to implement and while most of your visitors will never have a problem it makes no sense not to do it. Just because you're probably not going to be in a crash doesn't mean you don't wear a seat belt. The frontend being generated by the backend doesn't change the ridiculous inefficiencies and misunderstanding of Javascript shown by whomever developed the website.

For example, let's say you have 3 links and you want each one to open a box. The way your site is written means each link has its own listener. If you have 100 links or 1000 links... it starts to get very *very* inefficient, you'll have thousands of listeners! The correct way to do it is to have one listener and assign a class to each button, for example this is how you're doing it:

    &lt;a href=""#"" id=""my_button_12345""&gt;click me&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href=""#"" id=""my_button_12346""&gt;click me&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href=""#"" id=""my_button_12347""&gt;click me&lt;/a&gt;

    $('#my_button_12345')...
    $('#my_button_12346')...
    $('#my_button_12347')...

You're referencing an ID (#) and created a listener for each, when you should be doing:

    &lt;a href=""#"" id=""my_button_12345"" class=""a_button""&gt;click me&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href=""#"" id=""my_button_12346"" class=""a_button""&gt;click me&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href=""#"" id=""my_button_12347"" class=""a_button""&gt;click me&lt;/a&gt;

    $('.a_button')....

That's a single listener for as many buttons as you like. This is a fundamental part of Javascript, the code on your site assigning all these listeners contains a boilerplate comment copied from elsewhere on the internet.

""ugly code"" isn't the problem, fundamentally floored code is the problem.

\2. If you build the site with best practices in mind it will work with most platforms without any platform specific modifications.

\3. The irony here is that error displaying *is* a big security issue, which you mention as being a reason why this site takes time to develop. 

    You are also absolutely wrong about recreating this in a weekend; creating a secure, back-end CMS 
    is not a weekend job, unless you shabbily use deprecated query calls, and don't take 
    security too seriously.

Security and the database layer are all handled by your framework of choice (for you: codeigniter)... it would take a masterful screw up to implement poor security when codeigniter is the most amateur developer friendly framework.

If my time wasn't so valuable I would rebuild your site just to prove a point, but I was trying to be helpful not offend anyone :D I didn't realise you'd developed it, so I guess this makes my comments personal. I started in a similar way to you (just making things) and it's absolutely the best way to go about learning, but you should take a look at some articles about Javascript best practices.

The 2 tips that matter most to your site would probably be what I mentioned above (about listeners) and also Javascript fall back:

    &lt;a href=""#"" id=""club_1""&gt;click for club 1&lt;/a&gt; 

Let's say you have this code, you have a listener registered for the club_1 id and when the user clicks the listener opens the pop-up box. What if the user doesn't have Javascript enabled? Nothing. Here's how it's done properly:

    &lt;a href=""http://nightstarter.co.uk/club/1"" class=""club_button""&gt;click for club 1&lt;/a&gt;

Then you register a listener for the club_button class:

    $('.club_button').click(function(){
        var club_id = $(this).attr(""id""); // get the link
        // code for launching pop-up here
        return false; // this blocks the click executing, the users page won't change 
    });

That means IF the javascript executes it will launch the pop-up, if the javascript doesn't execute the user will be sent to http://nightstarter.co.uk/club/1 which should be a page containing the club information. If you're using proper MVC (as you should be when using codeigniter) it won't be any extra work for you.

I wasn't trying to offend by pointing out the quality of the site development is poor, didn't realise it was you, if I had known I would have phrased my criticisms differently. We all start somewhere and this isn't TERRIBLE work, but it's very amateur and you should definitely spend some time brushing up on best practices. You'll ensure that your work is maintainable in the future and when you do learn more and advance you don't come back and want to kill yourself for the heinous development crimes you've committed (as most people do when they return to early work haha)

JavaScript is definitely not my forte; I'm an amateur at this, thus borrowing many jQuery 'plugins'.

I'll look at applying the JavaScript 'fixes' sometime soon. When I was alluding to security, I was explaining the fact that using a framework delivers security minimises human error, sanitising inputs and (nearly completely) removes the possibility of attacks (we all know no website is impermeable to attacks, right?).

I think the website serves a purpose as it stands though, even with the inefficiencies and potential bandwidth-hogging services it provides currently (such as all images loading on page load, instead of with each popup call) but these are all on the bucket list of 'to do' improvements incoming (along with a sodding proper 'your city is not supported' page).

What really counts is the breadth of content and the writing and production quality. The UK turns out a broad variety of content which is a good thing. Most of the reality shite never makes it outside of the domestic market but the documentaries, drama, children's shows and comedy have a worldwide audience. 

If writers, actors and crews are getting experience in childrens shows or soaps who cares. Someone like Moffat started in kids shows and sitcoms. So by the time he gets to a show like Sherlock he knows his craft. You reduce the overall size of the industry and you get less possibility of developing talent. Cutting programming budgets at the BBC will hurt all UK production eventually I think. Eventually you end up like Australia or New Zealand which have become mostly incapable of producing genre television and make do with a couple of soaps and an occasional crime series. Raw talent is great but if you have no way of getting experience and lose institutional knowledge it is hard to recover. Shows like Doctor Who and Sherlock already suffer from the small scale of the UK industry as they can't maintain a healthy production schedule which I am guessing is as much about depth of writing talent as production budgets.",0,1360800673,null,0,1360801692,0,c8esiye,t3_18fueq,t1_c8esiye,t3_18fueq,null,1435585704,1,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,1

In my opinion the two men who made most of the mess were John Shittu (his agent) and Morgan Andersen (the sports director in Lyn at the time). Morgan Andersen was found guilty by the Norwegian Court of forgery and was given a year of suspended sentence.

Sidenote:

Mikel disappeared for a while when all of this was going on and nobody knew where he was. It was impossible to figure out where he was. One day I was celebrating my aunts 40th birthday at a pretty nice restaurant in Oslo. Suddenly I see Morgan Andersen coming into the restaurant. He looks around the room and share some words with a waiter and leaves. Two minutes later he enters again. After him comes John Shittu and another man from the Lyn-board. Then Chinedu Ogbuke Obasi enters (who also was a Lyn player at the time. He plays for Schalke today). Another nigerian player follows after him. Mikel is the fifth and last person to enter the restaurant. They sit down not far from our table. Didn't catch any of the conversation they were having. But I assume they were there to sort a few things out. A shy 12-year old version of myself built up a massive amount of courage and decided to ask them for an autograph. Some place at home I have a note with Mikel, Ogbuke and Bala's (the third nigerian) autographs.

Ian Chesterton, one of the first companions, did not trust the Doctor and regarded him as an ""old fool"". They accepted each other over the course of their travels, but tensions were always high.  
  
Turlough (a companion of the Fifth Doctor) only traveled with the Doctor because he was brainwashed by the Black Guardian and was trying to kill him. He eventually grew fond of the Doctor, but it was always difficult to trust him.  
  
In the Big Finish audios, there is a companion named Elizabeth Klein who was from an alternate reality in which the Nazi's won the Second World War. The Doctor decides to take her along with him to make sure that she doesn't change history back to the way she wants it to be... Let's just say that timelines get a little bit messy... I literally just finished listening to her stories and they are quite good. She's going to be featured in more audios later this year!

4OD can offer back catalogue because it is ad-funded.

true,listyraesder,null,null,"&gt;One thing that worries me is the elitism inherent in any argument that ""worthy"" programming such as quality historical dramas are the only valuable cultural exports.

*(Wait for it...)*

&gt; Most of the reality shite never makes it outside of the domestic market

Ironic.

Ironic and as wrong as can be. Some of the BBC's biggest international sales are reality based. **Strictly Come Dancing**, under the international brand *Dancing with the Stars*, has been sold for 42 international versions, including one of the top rated shows on US television. In 2006 and 2007 it was the most watched programme in any genre in the world. Along with *Top Gear*, it's BBC Worldwide's most important global brand.

The BBC has also had international success with **What Not To Wear**, with the British show rebroadcast in 22 countries and localised versions in the US, Italy, Colombia, Mexico and Argentina. **The Great British Bakeoff**, despite being only 2 (and a bit) years old, already has 4 international versions in development, while **The Week The Women Went** leapt from BBC Three to international versions including USA, Canada and this past year to Morocco (the first BBC sale to that country).

Reality brings in the money. It's good that we have it supplementing the licence fee. Add to that other UK-born formats such as **American Idol**, **Britain's Got Talent** (40 countries and counting), **MasterChef** (37 countries, each with up to 4 variations) **Come Dine With Me** (33 remakes, UK version shown in 7 countries and dubbed into Iranian for UK broadcast) and we have a very healthy stream of income.


&gt; Shows like Doctor Who and Sherlock already suffer from the small scale of the UK industry as they can't maintain a healthy production schedule which I am guessing is as much about depth of writing talent as production budgets.

Notwithstanding *Sherlock*'s stars are two of the most in-demand international film actors and unsuitable for large commitments, I don't see how Moffat's decision (for it was his) to make 3 Sherlock feature film equivalents per year is ""unhealthy"", especially when he spends 8 months per year shooting *Doctor Who* - It's a hugely demanding show, and the cast need time off to do other work. Moffat has already said any more than 3 *Sherlocks* at a time would be wrong, and result in him quitting the project. I don't think depth of talent's anything to do with it - the man's got 3 BAFTAs and won 4 Hugo Awards in 5 years. It's a bit like saying *""Poor Nick Park. 23 years and all he's got to show for it is 6 films, 5 BAFTAS and 4 Oscars. If only he'd had deeper writing talent and a healthy production schedule...""*

The UK TV industry, far from being small-scale, is one of the largest in the world. The BBC is the only TV distributor in the world capable of holding its own International distribution expo, while ITV (yes, even ITV) own studios in Germany, Australia and the US.
