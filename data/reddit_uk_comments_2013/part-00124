The parent previously gave their children a flat amount of money to cover their living costs. However, this means the one who lives on their own gets a lot more than the other one.

The parent then tells the one living on their own that they are no longer paying for the whole flat, but just for the room and board that they are using up. Basically, they are no longer subsidising the spare, unused room. They are removing the subsidy that had previously been provided.

For it to be a tax, the parent would have to still provide the full subsidy, then add an additional charge to the one who doesn't have a roommate.

Fight club's ""you are the all singing all dancing crap of the world"" sentiment seems to have gained popularity as a counter to self importance.

true,Thetonn,eng-sussex,Sussex,"First, didn't know about the factories, but as the article says, many were deemed to be inefficient and cost ineffective by the last labour government. There is also the issue that we do not have full employment as policy in this country, the state does not have an obligation to provide a job. One can both say people should find a job while removing artificial, state created jobs which are not reflective of the job market.

On two, ignoring the fact that the Bush and Reagan tax cuts both led to economic growth and that the sustainability of American debt and the running of deficits by them was at a similar level to Blair and Brown running increased state spending, plus the whole financial crisis and two wars, it is generally estimated that the Laffer Curve for the highest earners is at around 42 percent. This is much higher than the American one, but lower than the 50p rate, and would explain why high tax rates in the 70's drove many abroad, why tale Lawson budget of 87 was effective at raising the amount the rich paid while lowering their rates, why Labour kept the rate at 40 for all of their thirteen years in charge until they thought they would lose, why the fifty pence rate raised barely more than most rounding errors, why Hollandes 75 p has caused so much trouble and why we are raising so much more with 45 than with fifty.

Using 'America' to reject the Laffer curve doesn't work, it just shows the point is above 35 percent. The view that it is at around 42 makes both economic and statistical sense within the context of modern and historic tax rates. 

Ergo, if it is at that point, advocates of higher taxes are in fact cruelly and maliciously hurting the poor by making them pay more to cover the reduced income from the rich, while a champion of the working class would advocate cutting the riches taxes so they pay more.

In his eyes, Osborne is in fact helping the poorest by getting ore from the rich and lessening their tax burden. :-)",0,1371726879,null,0,false,0,camluic,t3_1gofks,t1_camluic,t1_camlou3,null,1430745949,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

* the rumour that i was going out with the ugly nerdy girl.  (i was, she wasn't the ugly nerdy girl.  but she was called terry, that wasn't to good)
* the guy who stabbed his sister to death with a butter knife (a fucking butter knife!)  turns out he actually accidentally hit her with a bread knife in a crowded kitchen.
* the woodwork teacher was being taught how to play the drums by the music teacher, one type of banging turned into another and now they are married with a kid on the way.  
* the geography teacher (fit as fuck) was constantly flirted with by the boys, until her big black bodybuilding boyfriend came in and punched a guy in the face.
* the PE teachers son hung himself.  nobody quite knows why, but of course the rumors were pretty crazy, from the simple ""he slipped"", to ""he was secretly gay"" to the crazy ""his dad wanted him to have sex with him whilst dressed and an alien and painted green""

true,rainator,cnty-wales,Cardiff,"a bit late but i have a few funny stories as i went to a fairly crap high school

* when they run out of money and couldn't pay the gas bill, so they fired 3 teachers.

* in sixth form, we were told that we had to do a welsh baccalaureate, which few unis accepted, and ended up being a hell of a lot of pointless work, we were told that if we didn't do it, we would have our EMA removed (having an unconditional offer from my chosen uni, and being one of 9 people not getting an EMA i wasn't too bothered). the whole sixth form refused to do it, they couldn't punish 250 students and they gave up trying to push it (on our year)

* we had one teacher who; threw a pupil of a river bank (about 10 feet tall), held another by his neck off his feet against a wall, and that was just in the 3 years before he retired.

* PE teachers shagging students goes without saying, but there was this physics teacher who apparently got in on that, which was hilarious as he was otherwise one of the most boring people in the school.

* one of our teachers dissipated one year, leaving behind a wife and 2 kids

* the filter on the internet blocked the school's own website

* there is a shop opposite the school where you can buy drugs (and not just pot either)

* a cock-up in the timetabling system meant my year 10&amp;11 didn't do any welsh, PE, RE, or any of the other compulsory subjects (except maths, science and English)

EDIT: also it is very possible that we could develop GM crops which will not need as much insecticide spraying and with much higher yields, both of these are very good news for our insect friends (the second because less land is needed for farming when farms produce much more).

Monoculture worries are very short lived if we were allowed to develop GM foods but I need you to explain what you mean exactly by biodiversity. Do you mean diversity in the specific plants or diversity available to the insects?

EDIT 2: just read you meant within the ecosystem. Well as I already said if we can increase crop yield we can free up land for things other than farming, if every country was using crops with extremely large yields we are soon going to have more food than we really need. In the world now we grow enough food to feed pretty much everyone, it is just logistics/money/greed that is stopping us from distributing it fairly.

Those who use tor to access sites relating to drugs or child porn for instance do so by browsing hidden services. This can only be done through tor (or I assume I2P etc but I haven't used those). For instance, this is the URL for The Cleaned Wiki, which is an easy to use 'jump point' into hidden services: http://3suaolltfj2xjksb.onion/hiddenwiki/index.php/Main_Page

As you note, installing tor is ridiculously simple. All it takes from there is a quick Google for, say, the Silk Road (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/) to find the URL. If someone wanted to look at child porn, they need only access one of several 'wikis' (the 'cleaned' one above is known as such precisely because it lacks these links) and it's one click away.

Contrast this to the likelihood of finding a viable drugs marketplace on the clearnet. It certainly facilitates criminal activity, and it is possible to say that without implying that tor should be regulated/censored.

Full time troops vs part time troops. The full time troops are on the clock, earning their yearly salary, no matter if they are at war, or not. They are classed as working even when not killing people.

TA, get paid to be TAs, however, they earn less, unless they go to war, in which case they will earn more.

Imagine the future, where there is less war. You still need an armed force, because, hell, shit happens. Full time troos are getting anything from £18k to £35k plus training and equipment expenses. No matter if they are doing nothing, or fighting a full scale war. Part time troops, will get paid for their training, and then if they are called up for duty. If there is no war, they don't get paid to fight one. There is not lesser training, or lesser equipment.

I am part of the fire service, which is slowly shifting emphasis from wholetime staffed stations, to part time on call service, and happen to think it's a fairly decent idea, working on a similar basis, but still wholly different.

true,Steampunk_Moustache,cnty-expat,Expat (USA),"Scandal 1: Design Technology teacher turned out to be a totally unqualified fraud who had completely and utterly lied about pretty much everything on his CV. Suspicions were raised when he began bragging to students that he'd designed the Mercedes A Class. He hadn't.

Scandal 2: Someone set the gym on fire, and then a month later, the assembly hall on fire, causing the building to be evacuated and everyone sent home on each occasion. Widely believed to be the same person/people each time, police investigated both events, utterly failed to find out who did it.

Scandal 3: One year we had a new music teacher who had a rather pronounced, well-endowed, hourglass figure. It took all of the first week of term for every boy in school to be having sniggering discussions about what they'd like to do with her in bed, and all of the first month before someone got suspended for giving her arse a firm smack-grope in the corridor.

Scandal 4: French teacher was reduced to tears after students staged a protest and refused to enter her classroom on the grounds that she was too strict and spent more time on discipline than teaching. The 'ring leader' was quickly (and perhaps, correctly) determined to be yours truly by the school's senior staff, and I was given 1 hour's detention after school every day for a month. The French teacher resigned at the end of the year. Interestingly, 2 years later after the GCSE's were over and the teachers brought us all into the assembly hall and reminisced a few of our year group's most notable students and moments, my name was announced and the national anthem played as the senior staffer I'd folded my arms at stared defiantly at as he tried to get me (and subsequently, everyone else) to enter. To my amazement he *congratulated* me not only on doing it, but on 'taking his punishment like a man, without the slightest complaint and remaining utterly unrepentant and proud.' He had, apparently, been truly impressed beneath his job-mandated veil of anger that he'd shown at the time.

Scandal 5: This one happened in college - a recently purchased, dilapidated old milling house earmarked to be converted into a new block of classrooms was burned to the ground by arsonists just after the insurance papers had been signed, and just before work had begun. The college was known for having large numbers of drug users (police officers were there looking for information on weekly basis) and gossip among the students was that the administration had blackmailed a drug-dealing student into carrying out the deed so that they could profit from the insurance and also get a better facility built.

Scandal 6: Again in college - people kept stealing from the vending machines by rocking them back and forth until everything fell out out of them. A security camera was installed, and it proved utterly useless as it was immediately covered up with something whenever people wanted to rob the machine. Many questions were asked, but none of the students seemed to know anything. The reason nobody seemed to know anything was that *everyone* was stealing from the vending machine, and mean *everyone*. 30, 40 people at a time would gather around it, a few rock the thing until everything spewed out, and then everyone would grab everything they could carry (and hide) and then split up.

UCAS points are only one part of a university application. You also need reasonable (not necessarily high) grades in relevant subjects, which for IT is going to include maths. You will also need to ability to express a strong interest in the subject you are applying for.

In terms of getting UCAS points, there is nothing more efficient than A levels. Most post high school courses are not going to offer them. 

I appreciate that you will be wanting to move on at this point and doing something else, but if you do have ambitions to get into uni, you will be making your life MUCH easier by taking the opportunity at your age to get a decent set.

If you do want to go down the non a-level route what you will probably be looking at is a level 3 BTEC. These generally take 2 years for a decent number of UCAS points, although I don't know how many you need.

true,Variola13,null,null,"&gt;When you get to this level its a question of the specifics of each locality's individual situation - the heavy lobbying to promote GMs however is based on a profit motive mostly not on a ""helping the poor people"" motive. Those specifics matter. If GM crops were unpatentable it would remove much of the opposition because research would be directed more by academia than industry and there is much more public trust for academia than for industry. It would also shift the incentives more to the public good and away from profit (although I am well aware that industry funds much of what academia does).

Those are good points. However you can only patent recombinant gene, one that has been designed and created in the lab, nothing 'natural' i.e pre-existing cannot be patented. Companies won't fund the academic research if they cannot patent recombinants,  that works with all big companies. It is stating the obvious, but that is the most crucial aspect of the patenting IMO. 
As for public trust, the anti-GMO lobby have insured that whether it is industry or academia the public will be mistrustful try telling reddit you work on GMO-relates organisms and within an hour you are a criminal scientist, in the pay of monsanto, only interested in money and out to harm farmers/people. :-) 
You point is valid in general though, to a certain extent, the public have more respect/trust for academia than industry, but it the case of GM, or anything else as controversial it is more difficult.

At that point We've lost some of the capability that we had with both Dzeko and Tevez, so if one leaves, it makes sense to offload the other and replace them with one guy, however expensive, to do that work instead.

If we sell both at market value (which might not be doable, but still) we get about 50m, give or take, and that goes a long way towards paying for Cavani. 

All that having been said, I think Guidetti could be a very similar striker to Cavani in the future with his combination of physicality and skill. He's a few years off for sure, but if only one of of Dzeko or Tevez leaves, I could see Guidetti slotting into that role. He couldn't be expected to perform at the same level as either of those two right off the bat, of course, but at least we'd have someone who could sort of play that way, and it would give him valuable experience, so that *maybe* in the future, we'd have our own homegrown world beater and wouldn't need to spend on the likes of Cavani.",0,1371732557,null,0,1371733179,0,cammvj6,t3_1gphn5,t1_cammvj6,t1_camm4c5,null,1430745466,2,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,2

It is not a man made problem in the ways you are implying, it is due to poverty in underdeveloped countries making vitamin rich foods unaffordable to the poor or that vitamin A rich foods are only seasonal. Education is important but many of these deficient people cannot change that fact by knowing why they are deficient.

The beta carotene pathway they used was one already found in the rice plants leaves. There was no evidence to suggest any negative health implications from increasing the beta carotene levels in the rice.

Golden rice was developed in 2000, are you saying that it needed 13 years of clinical trials before considered safe? If there had been no opposition to it it could have had trials within a couple years of its development and then distributed to the areas where it is needed. The fact that it isn't on the market anywhere at the present is a testament to the anti-GM movements ignorance.

Your point about fat being needed is beyond idiotic (the inferred point of this statement is that only Vitamin A supplements would solve the problem) and your point about them not only being deficient in vitamin A doesn't mean we shouldn't at least try to stop this deficiency. Also due to it being held up for so long they are now developing a rice which covers many other vitamins and iron as well.

Your allusion to poor western food is a non-point which just portrays your own unsubstantiated fear of GM foods.

You're right that alone golden rice isn't a panacea for malnutrition, it was a very positive step towards that goal.

Our 'rival' school was the catholic school just 200 yards down the road. They had fancier uniforms than ours, and were thus viewed as posh twat rich kids who liked jesus.

as for 'evidence to suggest she can't talk to the dead' - I really think this is quite illogical. It's like saying you have evidence that there is no god, or that there is nothing outside of the observable universe. There simply isn't such evidence - there is only arguments and claims against those who claim such things in the first place; and if you claim something *doesn't* exist, then legally speaking, you bear the burden of proof to back that up. which would get very sticky for you in court. 

which is why it makes much more sense to go a different way - demonstrate how these guys do what they do, show that it is simply mind games or whatever, rather than make claims you're going to struggle to back up.

true,RiverorRiver,river,River,"Not to turn this into a rant, but more than the Doctor's essence has been changed in a worse way than that. 

Moffat wrote some decent episodes under RTD. He even wrote some decent ones within his own show running career. 

However Moffat has turned the show not just into something that is more 'cinematic' but also more sexist and contrived. RTD's women were well thought out people with vulnerabilities. The Doctor took them on because he thought they were awesome people who could achieve greatness. Something else that I loved about it was that not all the women were white and a size 2. We even had a companion who did not have any sort of love interest in the Doctor (rare to find these days) and was defined by her talent, not her body or her 'mystery.' 

But now under Moffat, women are a problem. He jokes about how women are 'demons' and 'overemotional.' He kisses Jenny, a married lesbian woman, without her consent and doesn't apologize for it. He makes boner jokes with his sonic screwdriver and smirks when Clara asks if he dumbs down the TARDIS for girls. He doesn't take girls because he thinks they have extraordinary talents, but because they are a mystery. Amy had the crack in her wall, Clara was The Impossible Girl who was born for one purpose and that was to save the Doctor. How is that okay? 

And don't get me started on River Song. The Doctor takes away all agency and has control over most of her life. He treats her like crap (yelling at her not to break her wrist anyone? or sticking her in a library and not doing anything about it?) and then brushes off how he's treated her by saying 'how much he loves her.' 

Who wants a Doctor like that? I think this author said it best: 

[x](http://theidiotboxx.wordpress.com/2013/05/03/what-is-wrong-with-doctor-who/) (via draculemihawks) 

""Under Moffat’s watch the Doctor has morphed from an alien who loves humans and feels their pain and experiences love and desire and empathy to a stunted, child-like and extremely bloody irritating space-goon who flaps about like an injured moth when other people’s emotions are making him uncomfortable. And makes sexist jokes about how women are scary. And wants his married companions to sleep in bunk beds. And can save human lives but does not seem to understand human feelings. Who would travel with this man? He might be zany and charming and have nice boots, but he is fundamentally cold and unrelatable.""",0,1371737093,null,0,false,0,camo25r,t3_1gp4dv,t1_camo25r,t1_camdtgp,null,1430744907,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

The lump sum certainly would have helped cushion the blow for anyone losing out, although maybe a higher amount might have helped, and I'm sure something to look at to help solve the deadlock.

Stoke (H) - Draw; I think we'll score first, but concede maybe around the 70th minute. It'll be a spirited match and people will be very optimistic after the draw.

Villa (A) - Draw; We never start well. We'll show potential, but random things will not go our way (referee calls, stray beach ball, who knows). We'll blame luck and start to get pumped for the match against United.

United (H) - Draw; As we always do, we raise our level of play for one of the biggest rivalry matches of the season, though it is not enough for the win. Optimism will be at a peak once again.

Swansea (A) - Loss; This one brings us crashing back to earth, if the previous three draws haven't already. Coming off an entertaining draw against United, this one catches us by surprise.

Soton (H) - Win; The loss to Swansea is the ignition we need and we hammer Southamton at home by three goals. (Someone scores a hattrick here. Why? Good question.)

Sunderland (A) - Win; I mean, we gotta win SOME of these, right?

Crystal Palace (H) - Win; Against a newly promoted Zaha-less team, we win 3-0 (own goal, deflection, and a penalty should do it). Hope is back and so are the bandwagon fans.

Newcastle (A) - Win; Probably the only serious prediction on this list. I don't know what Mike Ashley is doing. We'll beat ALAIN PARDEAUX et LE TOON (heavy french accent here) at St James Park.

West Brom (H) - Draw; We probably won't concede more than one, considering they won't have the Lukaku vs Agger/Skrtel/Carragher mismatch going on (jk)

Of course, the difference being that Derren doesn't really pretend to be a magic man - he keeps on telling his audience it's a blend of psychology and showmanship.

Now, guess who wrote that episode? Moffat. Hell, I'd say the only Moffat episodes that didn't have great endings were his last two Christmas specials and Asylum of the Daleks. An argument could be made for The Wedding of River Song, but I've always been pretty fond of it.

As for your sexist argument, I'd have to disagree again. Moffat has problems writing women, yes. But by the same coin, he has plenty of problems writing men. Moffat's just not very good writing characters. He strikes some gold occasionally and I give him a lot of credit for Sally Sparrow and the Paternoster Gang. The fact remains though, that Moffat is much better at mood and plot then with characters. Since Doctor Who is a show that has plenty of women in it, this highlights Moffat's problem and makes some people feel that his work is sexist.

You say he is not as good as people think, which I hope you realize doesn't make sense. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. For one person, Moffat is the worst being in existence. To somebody else, he's the biggest thing since sliced bread. How 'good"" he is at writing varies for person to person, so if somebody thinks he is ""good"" then he is (to that person) a good writer.

I'd then work my notice period at work, using the time to sort out previous financial affairs, and getting my travel documentation on order.

Then, I'd spent a year or two exploring Europe and Northern America. Whilst that was happening, I'd have half the money put into whatever scheme will ensure the taxation is covered by profit - if I lose say x% in tax, the return on investment would level it out. The other half? Start donating it to random causes that interest me. There are a few homeless shelters and substance abuse charities that'd get a significant investment, for example.

I agree with nearly all of the quote you relayed up to the point where he is described as being ""fundamentally cold and unrelatable"". I suppose my issue is with the word fundamentally, I can see it heading that way but I don't believe it has reached that point yet.

As for River Song, the entire stormcage thing is a contrivance and really should be gotten rid of on just on the strength (or in this case weakness) of it's use to the story. I've never really considered it from a sexist perspective before and I will certainly run it through that filter next time I re watch the relevant episodes again. Looking back at the whole wrist breaking episode I think you are dead right. I had just never considered it before. 

I like River as a character and Alex Kingston as an actor. Do you think it is a net negative having a woman of that age playing such a strong part? I mean it is an absolute rarity on TV to see anyone like Alex in anything other than mother roles or do you think the whole sexed up camp thing doesn't do the opportunity justice?

Not necessarily a problem - I don't think its unreasonable for lenders to bear some of the responsibility for making unrealistic loans. Yet its not the bank's fault if someone loses their job and can no longer keep up the payments. And while excess credit is often implicated in bubbles, its not always easy at the time to know whether you're in a bubble or just a strong growth period.

Weakening the pound - could work either way. It could make exports more attractive - but who would we export to? Not Europe perhaps. But at the same time if our taste for imported goods didn't decrease much then we'd presumably see a bunch of related problems (inflation, consumption reduction).

* ridiculous penis sizes
* no body hair
* positions that only work on camera
* reinforces male/female dominance/submission dynamic 
* barebacking (particularly barebacking anal, something you should NEVER do)

As a source of entertainment, I think it's fine, but I don't think it's good to grow up on this stuff without knowing how utterly unrealistic it is.

UTD will have a good season, the only big change appears to be Rooney wanting to go.  They are a solid team and hard to beat.  I don't think the SAF leaving is as big a blow as is being made.  They have RVP and De Gea is not a bad goalie.  It is a bigger blow for Everton is my opinion.

Citteh have lots of money and  Pellegrini will not have the pressure that Jose has on himself. You can't write them off.

Liverpool could do well, much more is expected of them than their mid-table finishing - they have sound American investments  and if Suarez goes it is time for Sturridge to really step it up.

He has lost his pace, this what happens when strikers age.  Benitez had a better relationship with him than the others - who all got sacked by our owner.

Time Lords are more maneuverable and can carry more weapons, but Daleks have more firepower and can withstand more damage. There would be multiple classes/load outs for each race with a variety of skills and abilities. Of course, when you die as a Time lord, a TARDIS materializes around you, you watch your character regenerate as you wait to respawn and then your TARDIS drops you off in a random location. For Daleks, once you die, you simply watch another Dalek being produced in their ship and being rolled out.

The Ecuadorians can do what they like inside their embassy, and it's none of our business. 

So if we change them for police security we provide their embassy, logically they're entitled to charge us for the policing of our embassy in Ecuador, right?

Of course we can *ask* them to pay for the extra security, but I'm pretty sure their response will be ""just let Jules jump on a plane to Ecuador, just give him a free pass for that one journey from the embassy to Heathrow, and you won't have to worry about him any more, will you?""

That is already their established position, and I don't see the benefit of them restating it. The Ecuadorians are just going to say ""we don't need to pay for it, because we don't want this extra security that you're putting on for Jules"".

As far as Ecuador are concerned Assange is a political refugee - they're protecting him from our unjust prosecution of him. They take Assange's position that he's done nothing wrong, but he's being persecuted for publicising the crimes of the US government on his wikileaks site.

I agree with you that the whole situation takes the piss, but sometimes people take the piss and there's nothing you can do about it.

If you or I were in the pub and someone started shit-talking us then all we could do is leave, or ask the landlord to evict them; we couldn't punch the guy and get away with it.

If we were up on charges of assault, we wouldn't get away with telling the judge ""he was bad-mouthing me, your honour, I was entitled to hit him"" - that's because British law supersedes piss-taking.

Likewise international law, sovereignty and diplomatic relations supersede our desire to get at Julian Assange - international law, sovereignty and diplomatic relations allow Ecuador to thumb their noses at us, and there's nothing we can do about it.

At the very end of 1940 - after the Battle of Britain had been pretty decisively won and the Royal Navy vastly stronger than the German fleet after it had taken a hammering off Scandinavia - the US agreed to trade ships and equipment for bases on British land, strengthening the Royal Navy even further. It wasn't until a year later, after the US was itself attacked at Pear Harbour, that the US actually got involved.

Arguably, but it's a good argument, if the Nazis had tried to invade in strength at that early stage, the Royal Navy and RAF would have utterly malleted the invasion fleet and the war might actually have been considerably shortened as a result of those losses.

No, Britain wouldn't have been able to retake Europe on its own, but it was defending itself and Russia might have been able to defeat Germany in the meantime.

true,pandorasinbox,scot-Lothian,Lothian,"I went to two schools: Dunblane High School and a private school, that houses boarding students from across the globe. The private school was a horrible place generally, with kids who were obsessed with money, image and status - basically yuppies from cradle to grave. I was at Dunblane two years ahead of the kids who were caught up in the Dunblane massacre, so it was a pretty screwed up place.

Without saying exactly which school these took place at (except where it's obviously the private school)...

* An all out war between the private school boarding kids and the local state-run high school kids. When I say war, I mean with actual weapons. Knives, shivs, and hockey sticks with nails put through them (I shit you not) all confiscated by local police before anything got really serious.
* A girl who masturbated with a Twix bar then ate it at a year party.
* A gym teacher who ran off with and impregnated a 17 year old girl from another local high school.
* The headmaster who had it off with god knows how many mums of kids at the school, eventually impregnating one and having to leave his job for unprofessional conduct.
* A French teacher was locked in a cupboard for 24 hours by the sixth form students...
* She then went nuts and had a nervous breakdown in the middle of a class a few weeks later
* Similarly, an English teacher lost their handle on life the next year and would punish any student who looked her directly in the eye. Eventually she made the class sit facing the wall at all times.
* We had a Geography teacher who was suspected, but never proved, to be having relationships with 14/15 year old female students.
* Two ""totally straight"" guys caught having sex in a barn after getting shitfaced at a party... by the whole year who walked in on them.
* A little while after I left, one of my classmates got drunk one night, fell into a river and drowned while walking alone: http://www.scotsman.com/news/drowned-teenager-a-caring-and-loving-son-1-1162035
* And the last and most heartbreaking scandal is that of Ryan Liddell, who was jailed for life a few years ago for breaking into the house of a 76 year old woman and sexually assaulting her. What's worse is Ryan's story before that. Ryan was one of the kids shot in the Dunblane shootings and he had a host of psychological problems that resulted in his family kicking him out at age 15. He didn't tell anyone this had happened, and it was later discovered he had been living in a local forest in a tent. That kid was all sorts of fucked up.

Please just take my comment with a grain of salt and not as legitimate legal advice. It would be **MUCH** better if you waited for somebody with actual experience of handling such grievances.

**Here is what I would do, out of these three choices:**

1. Does your college provide legal representation/advice to students similarly to how many universities operate? If so, **SEE STUDENT SUPPORT.** They might be able to help you with legal advice or legal representation. I wouldn't count on it, it probably won't be the same as a university.

2. Make a complaint to Ofsted. They are not only the regulatory body for schools but also for colleges and (I think) universities. There should be a section on their website, an email address, a snail-mail address or phone number in which you can lodge a complaint. I think ""Fucking up the registration towards the OCR exam body"" is something worthy of Ofsted intervention.

3. Lawyer up and sue your college. **This is only if you have the money for a lawyer because I doubt many lawyers would even consider your case as a pro-bono job, and even then seeking no-win no-fee can be pretty tough and sometimes unreliable.** I doubt the cost of your course - even if you got in for free because you're under 18 - would really cover a civil suit in the small claims court, so that shouldn't be an option.

Before you consider any of these options, ask yourself how much will this delay your results by and would it really affect you in the long run by the time you graduate from college?",0,1371747639,null,0,1371747895,0,camrsp3,t3_1gqixc,t1_camrsp3,t3_1gqixc,null,1430743145,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

One thing that I think bothers a lot of people is how his episodes don't hold up to scrutiny involving the details, but the part that's neglected is that you never really notice it too much the first watch-through because Moffat writes scenes that are dramatically satisfying. Whether or not they make any sort of sense comes in at a far second, but Moffat works much more on an emotional level. This could be considered a good or bad thing, bad especially if you're really into hard sci-fi. Not that Doctor Who is hard science fiction.

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; So any time Ecuador thinks someone on bail is innocent we should give them a flight to Ecuador … ?

No, any time Ecuador thinks someone on bail is innocent we should allow them to provide refuge in the embassy. 

Ecuador should be allowed to keep as many fleeing criminals in their embassy as they're able to fit in there. 

The embassy is sovereign Ecuadorian national territory and, as someone else has pointed out in this thread, we would be declaring war on Ecuador if we went in there and got Assange.

It's not about ""the status quo"" - I would be the very last person to support that mindlessly, to say ""we have to do it, because that's the way things have always been done"".

It's that the international system of sovereign embassies offers more benefits than piss-takes. We can't invade their embassy without undermining that, and undermining the sovereignty of our own embassies abroad.

Let's say you go backpacking in Thailand, and a local villager and a bent cop try to shake you down you for a bribe by accusing you of molesting a local kid. You didn't do it, all they want is £100 of you and the accusation of the kiddy-fiddling is just an excuse to demand money from you.

Imagine you manage to get away and make it to the British embassy - you'd expect them to look after you and allow you sanctuary from the local plod, right? If you say that we should be able to get Assange out of the Ecuadorian embassy, you're advocating that the Thai police should be able to come in and haul you out of the British embassy in Bangkok.

Also, were you doing an apprenticeship? Not to add fuel to the fire, but there is a difference of around £5,000 between an apprenticeship wage and minimum wage (more so if you compare your pay to an entry-level position within the public sector in IT- look on the jobs section of your local council for inspiration). If you were not enrolled to do an apprenticeship, however they were paying you an apprenticeship wage, then you have financially lost out- something which the college (as your employer and training provider) should be held responsible for. However, I agree with Clbull that you **need** to seek proper legal advice on this one.

&gt;My understanding is that it's around 70 people in total losing money and only three losing the full £4000 a year, not the 70 losing the full amount as GMB would have you believe.

70 people out of how many thousands of employees? It's a restructuring of HOW they earn their money. There will be winners and losers. It's not about the earnings of individuals and the one time bonus seems like a decent compromise. They could take it out of the pockets of people earning £150K, but that's putting a bandaid on a broken leg.

Depends on what you define as ""easy"" to be honest. It's not hard to get in. There is a fence that has an open spot and from there it's basically going up stairs until you reach the top floor. It is spooky as there is a lot of destruction especially in the corridors but we did not meet anyone (I went with a friend). There is a lot of great shots to be had. I've been told there are also occasional security guards that patrol it from the connected building but I didnt see any. Once you get to the top there is a small bit of climbing to get to the actual roof, that is not too difficult but I would be wary if it's rainy that day, as it may get slippery. 

[Here](http://goo.gl/maps/qSXag) is the entrance. Those fences on the outside were not there but there is one blocking some stairs (which you cant see from the map). There are two separate stairways. One that gets you to the base of the building and another inside the building. Once you get passed that fence, you climb a couple of flights that get you to the base of the building. You can see the base from googlemaps. There is a hole you crawl through and then you are into the main buildings flight of stairs. 20 or so floors later and you are at the top floor.

It's not really an investment that people can take under consideration, because they just don't release their financial information in the kind of detail that you want to make a long term decision. They're pretty much playing off the whole ""Look at us, we're edgy and controversial, and buy owning part of us, you're sticking it to the big breweries^(1)""

The best example I can give is 10 tenure and I'd like to preface by saying I don't have a favorite between Doctors so it's not because I'm biased against Smith. During 10 lifetime he dealt with a ton of stuff: Losing 3 different companions, finding the Master was still alive, the birth of new cyberman, meeting again with Sarah Jane, fighting Davros again, the return of the time lords, the prophecy of his death (that was fullfilled, unlike the robot stuff Moffat pulled off), the short lived transformation into Time Lord Victorious and getting put in his place, etc.

 What I'm gettint to is that I think that even 10 says it one time, something along the lines of ""I've lived too much..."", I mean by the time 10 was leaving we felt (or at least I did) that it was the right time, it felt like his story was done. He came, he saw, and he conquered.

 And how many time did it took for this to happen? 3 years. The same time Smith has been given as the Doctor. I feel like 11 has not gone trough a journey like that of 10. When I found out he was leaving I was left thinking ""But c'mon, I still want to see more of him, he can make the Doctor as great or greater than previous incarnations if given the chance"".

* Costs incurred by having to do additional work to meet the new requirements - this could be charged at your current wage for example. i.e. 100 hours extra work at £6.31 ph = £631, so not to be laughed at.

* Costs incurred by any damage to your physical or mental health as a consequence of the stress this has caused you... if you are feeling depressed now would be a VERY good time to go and see your doctor to get it documented.

* Financial loses due to a delay in your qualification (i.e. starting work later than planned).

Again though you will **need** professional legal advice on this.

The biggest advice I can give you is **start documenting EVERYTHING**, for examples the work hours you have to do, any correspondance/phone calls/emails/conversations, any documentation from the start of the course, any legal aggrements/contracts you have signed etc.

My suspicion is that if you get a solicitor involved the college will probably look to make a quick and small out of court settlement. But you do need to be very careful here - educational institutions are not used to being sued, and haven't adjusted to the new consumer model of education. I've seen colleges and universities do some very vindictive things when threatened with legal action --  a good example was a colleague of mine who failed a year at university. The uni tried to remove him from the course and he threatened legal action, causing the university to prompty back down... however a year later he mysteriously failed a subjective oral examination during the final exams and so failed the entire course.

For me, there's no question -- Benedict is hundreds of points above all the others in my book!

Honestly, I think Cillian is the most beautiful man I've ever seen. Yes, even more beautiful, objectively, than Benedict. However, everything about Benedict (his mind, his heart, his talent, etc) make him much more desirable to me.

I also adore Martin Freeman for the same reason -- it's the whole package I find so appealing, not just the eye candy!

I do like Colin a lot, but I wouldn't put him among my top few.

From BBC
The girl said she felt manipulated by the police after she was brought back to England from France.

She said she felt ""if I didn't comply with what they (the police) were doing, I faced arrest"".

Say what you will about Moffat, but at least acknowledge that he has made some very progressive additions to the show: 
&gt;1. Shown us our first regeneration that crossed racial lines (Mels to River) opening up the canonical possibility of future regenerations of the Doctor being played by non-white actors.

&gt;2. The first compainion (Amy Pond) to travel with the doctor while married, showing girls that marrige isn’t the end-game and life can continue afterwards.

&gt;3. The first lesbian couple on Doctor Who to have a recurring role (Vastra and Jenny).

&gt;4. Allowing a woman in her late forties (River Song) to not only be an action hero but a sex symbol. How many other women on TV can you think of that fit that description? In a time when the media is telling us that women are obselete passed a certain age, River is both appealing, useful and mature.

&gt;5. In addition to above having River be excited about her regeneration into a older woman.

&gt;6. Having Canton Everette Deleware’s sexuality not revealed until the very end of Day of the Moon, making his back-story make sense in retrospect but also allowing the audiece to make up their own opinions on his character without bias.

&gt;7. Having Liz Ten be a black woman, showing the possibility for interacial relationships within the royal family. Imaging someone suggesting that fifty years ago. Hell, imagine someone suggesting that ten years ago.

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; I also don't see why people should be sent to prison for what is a victimless crime.

I have conflicting feelings about it all, really.

If, in 20 years time, they're married with kids (or even: divorced but still on speaking terms, with no regrets) then it'll prove that society had nothing to judge them for.

On the other hand, teenagers do need to be protected, and there is a power imbalance between kids and teachers. Teenagers get crushes on their teachers all the time, and it's the teacher's job not to act on them. 

I think that it's crazy to distinguish so arbitrarily between a teenager who's 15 years and 11 months old and a teenager only a few weeks older, and that a much more sophisticated framework for sex crimes would be beneficial.

Nevertheless, I don't see how we could make laws that would actually protect vulnerable minors that wouldn't prosecute someone like Forrest.

A significant and fundamental problem is that victims of abuse are often in denial and side with their abusers. Battered spouses will often ask for the prosecution to be stopped or refuse to testify; teenage victims of grooming will often consider their pimp a ""boyfriend"" and rationalise that ""he didn't mean it"", even when they're being sold or gangbanged.

So the experts in these matters tell us that we need to prosecute even when the victim wishes the charges withdrawn. 

So even assuming the relationship was ""harmless"", that Forrest had his lover's best interests at heart and that, even underage, she was psychologically mature enough to consent, I don't see any way to resolve this, and protect other victims, without sacrificing Forrest.

If you don't think so, try not paying your land taxes, or do some crazy shit on your property. It will be taken away. You never own land.

As I said, for the file size they look great, especially one smaller screens. If you can afford the kind of TV and sound system needed to really enjoy an uncompressed Blu Ray rip then you probably don't need to be torrenting your films anyway, but if, like many others, you watch the majority of films on your computer or a small screen through headphones and file size is something you need to take into consideration, then YIFY torrents are ideal. 

Also, those comparisons you linked to are a shitty way to compare the quality of a moving image, and are possibly misleading since it looks like there's some motion blur in the YIFY ones. Even so, I think they look pretty good - obviously not quite as good as the non-YIFY ones - but still great.

true,Yeats,null,null,"Your criticisms are just as relevant for your own response. If you want to play the relativism game than your response is just as subjective. 

As for you're points let me try and break them down. As for you're first example you believe this is a mark of great writing- I do not. I see that as a convenient and simple fix to a big problem. Just because the plot is complex does not negate that issue. However I rather liked that episode, as well as most of his episodes. But my opinion is that it was poor writing.  A silly quote does not prove anything. 

Next you are trying to claim that he is also bad at writing male characters and that somehow that excuses his female characters. No. Just because he's not good at something doesn't excuse the portrayal of the character(s). The work is an art. And I believe (as well as many MANY others) that the portrayal of female characters is sexist (to say the least). Nothing about being better at plot than characters or male characters failing as well changes that. Your point is invalid. If you want to argue against being sexist you should point out instances where he has proven himself to be a champion of women- although I doubt you (or anyone) can do that. 

Lastly as I have already addressed my comments are opinions just as yours are. You have committed the same crime you charged me with. My opinions are not ""void"" because some people may like moffat. I never claimed that he was absolutely garbage and no one should like him or could enjoy his episodes. I said he is not as good as people think he is. That is an opinion. You responded to me with another opinion. 

If you can mount a proper argument than please do so, but so far you've provided zero evidence to deny my claims ( a quote, male characters suck too, and everything is relative- are all horrible arguments). If you don't like someone's opinion than ignore it and post your own. ",0,1371758546,null,0,1371758756,0,camwad0,t3_1gp4dv,t1_camwad0,t1_camoa6h,null,1430740959,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Luis Suarez scored 23 goals for Liverpool FC this season in the Premier League.

They finished seventh and their only entry to Europe is via a Fairplay option, which is ironic given his biting of Ivanovic and ten match ban.

By all means....say you do not like Torres on a personal level, say that you do not like his haircut or are jealous of his salary and good looks.

These are all valid points that I can understand and easily comprehend.

true,Grabthars-Hammer,null,null,"I don't know if there's a common MLS side among Spurs fans, but here's my take on the league as an American:

By far the most popular teams in terms of support are the three Cascadia teams, i.e., Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver, especially the first two. The atmosphere in their stadiums has been getting us some international respect, for a change. If I were a newcomer to the league with no geographical allegiances, I would want to root for one of those teams. They are both the bright spots and the future of the league.

LA is currently the most successful and highest spending squad, but they don't have the passionate fan base that you'll find in Cascadia.

There are some smaller-market clubs that have dedicated fan bases as well, like Kansas City and Salt Lake, that have been very successful as of late. The two larger markets with great fan support would be Philadelphia and my own team, Chicago, though we've been in a bit of a slump the last few years.

Most MLS teams play a fairly ""British"" style...very direct attacks, very physical, although if you like the Continental/Latin possession game, Salt Lake or Portland are fun to watch. Montreal is also fun as hell to watch at the moment, and are riding a wave of success thanks to their Italians.

Of course, I'd love to steer you towards my own club, with its history, success, and awesome design aesthetics, but any of the teams I mentioned above have great followings and are fun to watch (not that the ones I didn't mention aren't worth your time). If you want our ""equivalent"" of Tottenham, I'd probably go with Kansas City, at least since their rebranding.

You may also like to check out the Newcomers Guide on the sidebar of the MLS subreddit for some guidance.

**TL;DR, I would recommend Seattle, Portland, Vancouver, Montreal, Salt Lake, Kansas City, Philadelphia, or Chicago, because of their devoted fan bases and their on-field successes.**",0,1371760094,null,0,false,0,camwx91,t3_1gqysr,t1_camwx91,t3_1gqysr,null,1430740660,11,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,11

&gt; * Mkhitaryan flew to Vienna, Austria on Thursday and with no deal in place with LFC, is now expected to join up with his teammates. ([Echo](https://twitter.com/TheKop305/status/347835305040175104))

&gt; * LFC remain confident of completing a £9m deal for Mignolet and they lead the race for Atsu. ([Echo](https://twitter.com/TheKop305/status/347835535940804608))

&gt; * LFC's bid to sign Papadopoulos is over, after initial negotiations with Schalke proved fruitless. ([Echo](https://twitter.com/TheKop305/status/347835815038156800))

&gt; * LFC value Papadopoulos at around £12m, but Schalke's insistence on a deal worth around £20m means the deal is no longer an option. ([Echo](https://twitter.com/TheKop305/status/347836062669885440))

Also it may be of interest to look at some agencies, although these actors usually require payment, if there was someone that you particularly liked the look off you may be able to strike a deal. 

Secondly regarding the logistics of the film; the end of August/beginning of September is a pretty crazy time in Edinburgh due to the Fringe. Depending on locations you have in mind it may be useful for you to have someone on board who knows the city (P.S I'm not hinting, but would be willing to help out!) Filmfocus are a good bunch to get in contact with regarding rights to film in Edinburgh; depending on the marketing of the film and if you are hoping to send this to festivals etc. It may be worthwhile obtaining permission to film in these locations as sometimes they can come down pretty hard if there are no contracts involved.

*Luis Alberto* - As we know, is arriving tomorrow for a medical. £6m initial fee with £1m in add-ons.

*Simon Mignolet* - We're leading the race for his signature for £9m

*Christian Atsu* - Again, leading the race for him.

**Worrying News**

*Henrikh Mkhitaryan* - No fee agreed yet due to previously mentioned mix-up over fee (probably due to 3rd-party ownership). He's gone to Vienna with Shakhtar for their Alpine training camp

**Bad News**

*Kyriakos Papadopoulos* - Our interest in him looks to be over. Can't agree on a fee. We want to pay £12m, they want £20m.

**Silver Lining**

*Toby Alderweireld* remains an option, since the Leverkusen negotiations seem to have fallen through.

I sometimes see play I could somewhat compare to Spurs. They often look for a quick attack using their wide positions very well. They move the ball relatively patiently in defence and midfield, sort of like Vert and Daws with Hudd or Parker, only to spring a goal on the opposition with clever passing and quick running. They switch between play in many formations but 4-2-3-1 and 4-3-3 do tend to show up and with them being as successful with it, their position in the table has been reflecting their play... it's an exciting time to be an Impact fan and the atmosphere is good, but their [ultras are awesome.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ultrasmontreal/7432484698/in/set-72157630265017306/lightbox/)

Impact has a pair of great Italians, Di Vaio and Nesta. Di Vaio has the most goals for the team [(first half hat trick, overall great game at the end of May)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=RyCV6_RQFwU) and it's awesome to watch Nesta somewhat coaching the defense as he plays. Plus he's still got an amazing slide tackle. Their captain Bernier has been one of my favourite players, it's cool to see him back where he started 13 years ago and he's a great DM.

true,FlamingBearAttack,null,null,"&gt;As far as rape of ones wife goes that's not consensual so I don't see how that's in any way equivalent. Just because rape used to be legal in certain circumstances doesn't have any bearing on this case.

You were suggesting that Forrest be given some leniency or sympathy because the crime he committed is a crime ""Only according to relatively recent legal definitions"". My point was that that is a meaningless statement to make a defence of ""I only committed a crime that *just* became a crime! I shouldn't be held accountable for it!"".

&gt;As far as being a victim, she doesn't see her self this way

Doesn't she? I think it's worth pointing out that many victims of abuse don't consider themselves to be victims. If I were to reply to an e-mail from a Nigerian Prince about investing some money in a business opportunity, would I not be the victim of a con, even though I initially considered myself to be a willing investor?

&gt;How is she served by manipulating her into believing that instead of a loving relationship with someone who provided support to her she was in fact raped and or abused.

Child abusers often occupy a position of trust or authority or power over their victim, who is left feeling duped and tricked and betrayed. Relationships like these can be very damaging.

I find it curious how you think that the people who have manipulated this girl are the child protection experts, and not the 30 year old who pursued a child and then ran off with her.

&gt;I'm not sure why its illegal for 15year old to decide what to do with their own bodies

It's illegal for 15 year olds to have sex with adults because they are unable to make well-considered decisions. For the same reason, it's also illegal for 15 year olds to buy tobacco/drink alcohol/vote/and why certain restrictions are placed on the hours and type of work they can do.

&gt;The majority of people who go through puberty want to have sex with people they care about

Yes, but the people they want to have sex with are usually their own age and have been educated alongside them. 

&gt;they are meant to have sex, the species is meant to procreate

Not with adults. And no, teenage girls aren't meant to reproduce. They suffer a greater risk of complications, greater chance of miscarriage, babies are often smaller/weaker than normal. It isn't healthy for 15 year olds to be pregnant.

&gt;As far as the grooming / sexual slavery / prostitution / rape cases go - from what I have read it sound like the girls involved where not involved in initiating any sexual behavior through choice but where forced into it either through threats of violence or incapacitation due to drugs.

My point with this comparison is that in Oxford/Rochdale and in the Forrest case, the victim's described their abuser as their boyfriend. They believed that they were in a relationship. It's worth noting that in each case the victim was especially vulnerable: in Rochdale/Oxford the girls were in care, and the girl Forrest ran off with felt neglected as her parents had divorced and her mum was pregnant again. 

&gt;I think to compare the consensual relationship between Forrest and the girl with forced prostitution, rape and physical violence does a disservice 

No. Comments like yours are the ones which do a disservice. You make it easier for people like Forrest to think that what they're doing is okay, you make it harder for abuse victims to realise they have actually been abused. Comments like yours cause abuse victims to doubt themselves and think that people will disbelieve them if they try to get help.",0,1371766330,null,0,false,0,camzav3,t3_1gq9we,t1_camzav3,t1_camuzpl,null,1430739538,-5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-5

true,RiverorRiver,river,River,"Although some of the points about Liz Ten and Canton were spot on, in your comment, some of your other points have problems with them. 
 
1. Yes, crossing racial lines is good. But isn't having the 'black' River also being the most out of control and crime ridden River who becomes redeemed once she's turned white just a little racist? 

2. Although I love the fact that there's a married couple on the TARDIS, don't get me started on Amy Pond. So much potential wasted. Here's just a few examples.
     a. She forcibly kisses the Doctor and it's played for laughs. 
     b. Mystical Pregnancy Trope. Twice. 
     c.  Her whole life revoles around two men and although we see her take on a few odd jobs (model, journalist) she never shows any interest or development for those things. In my opinion, if she was going to work, she would be an artist. We see that she always draws things both as a child and an adult and she could mark her inspiration to Vincent Van Gogh. See? Development. 

3. I love Vastra and Jenny. But their relationship is often played just for giggles. ""Haha. We're so lesbian together. Wow! We're married. Haha."" I already mentioned the Doctor's nonconsensual kiss played for laughs as well as boner jokes. Their relationship isn't really developed past the fact that they are lesbians. 

4. River's age is awesome. The fact that she's a sex symbol is awesome. But there's a lot of problems with her that the article doesn't really address, or sees as agency when it isn't. 
     a. When did River decide to go to Stormcage for the Doctor? If someone threw you into prison for five years wouldn't you be annoyed? 
     b. When did River decide to be 'saved' into a computer instead of allowed to rest in peace? When did she ever express the want or desire to become a mother? 
Also, anyone else bothered by their good bye scene? I mean River is rightfully kind of bitter and angry about it as the Doctor has been nothing but crap to her. And all of his yelling at her and ignoring her is excused through a whole ""I couldn't bear the thought of saying good bye?"" That's crap. So crap.
5. No problem with River being an older woman. I think it's great.

Moffat has written some good stuff. Lots of his early episodes are awesome and some of my favorites. But it's his constant use of tropes and sexism as show runner that really makes me angry. Especially when the Doctor himself displays it in my earlier examples. ",0,1371768194,null,0,false,0,camzz2s,t3_1gp4dv,t1_camzz2s,t1_camueg0,null,1430739149,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

The only response I could come up with was that I wasn't completely sure I would still be against it, but that I hoped I would be. 

There's a tough balance that has to be struck in the justice system between the rights of victims and the rights of those accused or convicted of crimes and to me the best way to strike that balance is to base decisions on facts as much as possible and most of all to be consistent. Our judgement is most clouded when we are hurt, angry and scared which is why we need judges, and should have law makers, to consider factual information and reach an informed decision not simply placate public opinion or those of victims.

If somebody ever hurt or killed a member of my family I can't guarantee I wouldn't want to see them put to death, hell I can't guarantee I wouldn't want to do it myself, but I believe that to any fair justice system the ultimate choice shouldn't be made on my judgement.",0,1371768685,null,0,false,0,can05ay,t3_1gqpwh,t1_can05ay,t1_camznyn,null,1430739068,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

The kiss was in the Crimson Horror. I mean lesbian women already have a problem in society in being believed that they 'haven't found the right guy yet' and the fact that the kiss was non-consensual made it worse. The 'lesbian who hasn't found the right guy' shows up in Sherlock with Irene Adler, if you watch that. She was established as a lesbian and then fell in love with Sherlock.

&gt; But are you really? I'm not a selfish person by any stretch of the imagination. I give to charity when I can, and always go out of my way to help others in need, but with £140m I would be too busy living it up somewhere fancy, drinking shitloads of alcohol and just generally enjoying doing whatever the fuck I want (obviously within reason). Yeah, I'd hook up a few of my friends and family with some cash to make sure they're good and set up a monthly transfer to charity, but being 100% honest, I think we all know we would be too busy enjoying our new found fortune to think about all that other stuff. Maybe in about 15-20 years or something when I'm bored or something considering I'm not already dead from overindulgence, but definitely not for a long time.

Even at my most self-indulgent - holidays in the carribean, luxury cars, gigantic houses - I could never spend more than 40m over the remainder of my life. 100m on the other hand could buy some interesting scientific discoveries, perhaps cure an illness, help a whole load of people get really good educations - the sort of benefits that will last from now until the time humankind becomes extinct.

true,bookchaser,tardis,TARDIS,"&gt; How did you get into Doctor Who, and what was your first experience like watching?

In my youth, Doctor Who was broadcast on PBS Saturdays at 11 p.m. The episodes were something like 30 minutes each (originally broadcast one per week), but PBS ran an entire story with the episodes back-to-back.

 I had a certain fascination with it, but it was also boring at times, but hey, the whole family was awake until 1 a.m. watching TV, so, yay! I saw the Tom Baker years, and the Leelah episodes were the most memorable (the Doctor having a scantily clad brutish knife-wielding hunter cavewoman at his side... sort of like a female Worf wondering why we don't resolve our problem by breaking the neck of the person causing the problem, and the Doctor having to keep her in check).

So when Doctor Who rebooted in 2005, I was obligated to resume watching as it was part of my upbringing.

If you are watching on Netflix, be aware there are two missing episodes.

1. *Planet of the Dead* comes after *The Next Doctor* in what will look like Season 4. There's actually something called ""Series 4 Specials"" that were 5 episodes that ran after Series 4 the next year, but weren't dubbed Series 5. *Planet of the Dead* contains a very important foreshadowing for the next 4 episodes. Amazon has that episode.

2. *A Christmas Carol* is at the end of Series 5 (after *The Big Bang*). This is the best Who story yet, IMHO, and well worth rent-streaming from Amazon if you're on Netflix.

First year: A series of small music festivals and one mid-sized one. 

Invest 10 million to provide scholarships in STEM subjects.

Buy a farm somewhere in the mountains, rent it out for life to a local farming family, and build or adapt a small place for myself somewhere on the estate. Get a few other places here and there - nothing too showy. Buy some woodland in Kent or Sussex.

Five years: Either the festivals worked or they didn't. Ah, well it was probably fun. I expect to have a long beard by now, and wear a bathrobe at all times.

Twenty years: Usually stay at the farm, shuffling about and peering suspiciously at people. Occasionally go into town and give buskers fantastically expensive, rare 1950s guitars, or just stand in Oxfam all day, humming a tune to myself. But mostly I'll be on the upper hills of the farm.

There's absolutely nothing wrong with a referendum enforced by convention and politics - it just means that politicians/the media will hold the government to account, rather than the courts. Of course, a government would have the discretion to renege - but at huge cost to the party. None of the issues you touch on would be raised by this approach, and it is one that has been with us as long as Parliament.

I think a second way you could argue it infringes on our constitution is that referendums on issues which don't go to the root of our constitution/social contract should be dealt with under our representative (rather than direct) democracy.

true,sinistersuperspy,tardis,TARDIS,"The entire time he has known her, he knows* how and when she will die. Each time they meet, they are one step closer to that tragedy. Now imagine You are the Doctor, and your SO is River. 

I believe he loves her deeply, but each time they cross paths, his hearts break a little more, knowing she is closer and closer to death. 

A couple points to consider: 

a) In ""Forest of The Dead"" River tells The Doctor ""The last time I saw you, the real you — the future you, I mean — you turned up on my doorstep, with a new haircut and a suit"". I suspect that this will likely be revealed in an 8th series episode with the 12th Doctor, effectively closing River's loop. I say this because River has seen The 11th Doctor in his various forms - so nothing new there.

*b) A theory floating around following ""TNOTD"" - When GI messed with The Doctor's timeline, it effectively altered any and/or all of his experiences, and the outcomes due to his actions. With Clara's voluntary sacrifice, nullifying those changes by GI, didn't guarantee that events occurred in the precise order they had originally.  So - If the Doctor wasn't able to ""save"" the library in the same way - River must have - which means she didn't necessarily have to sacrifice herself to stop the Vashta Narada. Which is why the Doctor could physically interact with her in his tomb. She was no longer a data ghost from CAL. Also, Neither Strax, Jenny or Vastra indicated in that short scene that they didn't see River. Their reactions could have been to The Doctors comment about ""no one else seeing her"", which would be weird, if they could.

At the end of their scene, River hints at a reason as to why she'd still be there if Clara was gone. The Doctor asks how - River, of course, says ""Spoilers"", and disappears. 

Here's the thing: When she does, it looks an awful lot like the teleport from the library. 

All pure speculation, but tantalizing nonetheless.

Which I hope to do when I get a week's vacation in a month or so!  I will say that I recently went back and watched the RDJ Holmes movies again.  They're still fun, but overall, Sherlock does it far, far better.  RDJ-Holmes is incredibly good looking and entertaining but I feel like he's too much of an 'action figure!' type Holmes.   (And by 'too much' I mean 'not that I'll ever stop watching him').  They're both ridiculously attractive in their own ways, but Benedict brings an intensity and a sense of slightly puzzled disconnection from the rest of the human race that I don't think RDJ really pulled off.  Jude Law and Rachel McAdams were 'okay' while there was no competition on the scene, but Martin Freeman and Lara Pulver blew them out of the water.  I kind of hope they don't bring Pulver back - not only because her character *is* fleeting in the original Holmes stories, but because my god, that episode deserves to stand alone.  It is the episode to which I have compared all other episodes, and none of them have lived up to it - although the final episode in the last season did come close.  And I am so over the top in love with Una Stubbs that it's just not a fair competition for anyone else as Mrs. Hudson.

Wait, wait, I was having a discussion about Moriarty, wasn't I?  RIGHT.  So my point was that of all the characters that I compare between those two, Jared Harris is the only exception as to preference.  I fucking *loved* him as Moriarty.  He was, to me, the perfect mix of self effacing professor and vicious criminal mastermind.  So yeah, you're right, to me the over the top really doesn't help, but I think it might also be that his voice reminds me of a bad Snagglepuss impression...

Toph walks around just normally with her eyes closed. She would not have a problem with the angels granted there's light enough for the angels to believe they can be seen. Then in the case that when there is not light, the angels would move, causing vibrations to be felt. 

I'd go so far as to say that normal humans have the ability to perceive vibration. I'd be interested to know the vibration level produced by the angles as they do not make any sound (as far as we know) while they are moving, just look at ""The Angels Take Manhattan."" Toph may be able to sense them, but the angels may not be able to sense if she can sense them. It's really a question of what the word ""observe"" means, especially in terms of the blind. The concept in ""Blink"" of not blinking and they don't move is really what observe means right now in terms of the angels.

I say the angels would behave as they normally would in a lighted situation, and in the dark they would be un-quantum locked with Toph being able to sense them, effectively doing what she does in the picture. Unless it is determined in proper canon that the sensation of vibration would cause them to lock.

true,Joedoon,null,null,"He definitely loves her. I just think he gave up love after he lost his family, hundreds of years of guilt and lonliness drove him to completely leave that part of his life behind, concentrating purely on adventures and exploring the universe. 

So when he was at his darkest, found Rose and fell in love with her (though on multiple occasions showed trouble admitting it) he suddenly found himself being able to return to the romantic side of his life. When she was also taken away from him it was once again a a heartbreaking time, reminding him that when he loves people he eventually finds his heart breaking. Top that with the pain of losing Madam De Pompadour, Astrid etc. I think all his loses and heart break have made him somewhat paranoid of pain, so when River came along and he realised he would one day love her, but on that very same day saw her die. He most likely tried to hide from that pain, unlike Rose or Susan whos departure only lasted minutes, her departure is something he faces everytime he sees her. When they share adventures, kiss, flirt, he has the burden of knowing she will, and already has broken his heart. So that's why I think he tries to somewhat distance himself from her at times, to defend his emotions. But when you think of all the times he shared with her, what they have been through and what he goes through when he takes her out of prison each night just to put a smile on her face.

A few of them are middies but majority is u-21 offshore attacking talents.  Anyone want to help me widdle this list down?

Depends on which direction Redknapp wants to take really.  To be honest I don't think you can build a Premier League team on veterans.  You have to pick up some talented youngsters that can continue to develop as players right through a Premier League campaign.  Sure, it is a risk but I think Redknapp knows talent when he sees it.  A few years in the Premier League, these players are worth much more and you really have the base to build a real contender in the top flight.

Of course, I've more of less gotten over the departure of Rose, and at this point when I re-watch Doomsday I think it's more beautiful than sad. However, there is always a rotating cast, and the characters you come to love will never stay forever. The show gets significantly better come season 5 when Steven Moffat takes over, which is always nice. I know that being a Whovian is sometimes terrible, but it's also wonderful, and I guarantee that once you become fully invested in the show, you will never want to go back. However, there is a looming event in the distance that will surely devastate you as it did to me, and that's the day you run out of new episodes. The only thing that you can do to try and combat this is try and pace yourself so quitting new episodes when you finish season 7 will be more bearable.

true,nikcub,lfc68,null,"&gt; AVOID: Daily Mail, Mirror, Independent, Telegraph (and foreign sources such as Marca, Bild, l'Equipe - these are sports-oriented papers that will happily bend the truth, and occasionally get a story correct)

between these newspapers they break ~60% of stories. Mirror on Mkhitaryan and Aspas and the Telegraph nailed SAF leaving and Pellegrini coming in. Marca get all the Real Madrid news and a lot of the Spanish league (such as Aspas travelling to England).  The Sun and Marca got Mourinho returning, Carroll to West Ham and The Sun got Balotelli packing up his apartment and leaving for Italy (*month* before anybody else). Goal.com have employed former editors from Sky and BBC (Sam Lyon) so they are getting a lot of Arsenal and Chelsea stories first.  They are also the largest employer of football journalists in the world.

The BBC isn't 100% reliable either. They **published** [Tevez to Juventus](https://twitter.com/BBCSport/status/336364449973796865) and Cavani to Manchester United. the Times feel for the Qatar fantasy football league story. The Guardian has had and *absolute shocker* with rumors in the past 12 months since they fired almost their entire football department (a lot of who went to work for goal.com). [Gareth Bale to Manchester United?](http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/jun/14/football-transfer-rumours-bale-ronaldo) right - or better yet, [Falcao to Manchester United](http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/apr/15/1), a story in The Guardian that was picked up from an amateur blogger on Bleecher Report - down to the name of the scout. No other media would touch it, the Guardian did.

The fact is that all football sources are becoming a lot like each other - the gap between higher quality and lower quality is narrowing. There is absolutely no way to split these guys up into lists of good and bad - what used to be better newspapers are now falling into the trap of publishing rumors, while what used to be considered poor newspapers have quality journalists with strong connections to the clubs on their beat (the Tele with City, the Sun with United).

When a story breaks and you ignore the Mirror, Sun, Telegraph etc. you are only going to end up posting the same story from another source who just copied it from the original source. You would be rewarding the copiers, not the people doing the work on the ground and breaking the stories. All of the newspapers listed here hire journalists who spend 24/7 entrenched with the clubs they report on, they have connections to agents, managers, clubs, administrators, players etc. You just need to be able to tell the difference between a planted story (eg. ""Eriksen gaining interest from Liverpool and Dortmund"" - is a story from Eriksen's agent. ""Liverpool pursuit Mkhitaryan"" could also be a leak from the players agent, but the difference is that it is reporting interest)

A lot of people also want to hate the tabloids because of how they report outside of football - a conversational tone of writing with a lot of slang, yellow journalism etc. That doesn't mean that they don't have good sources in football. When agents leak news they want the widest audience possible, not the guys who write in the nicest style. Larger distribution gets you more pull in the journalism world and that means that the tabloids, the times and the telegraph are at the top of the pyramid.

The fact is that the tabloids, outside of rumors, get it right a lot of the time. When The Sun gets it wrong - they apologize, as they [did to Chelsea](http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/857864). It is those stories that have the standard - two sources, a fact-checked and an editor. That is the same at all of those papers. For anything labelled a rumor, it is on for anything. You also can't fact check rumors since if a rumored transfer doesn't turn out to go ahead it doesn't necessarily mean that the rumor is wrong. Transfers fall apart for all sorts of reasons - agents making last minute demands on more image rights, clubs not bending to player wage demands, medicals failing, other clubs stepping in etc. (this is the problem I had with the fact check site which I was contributing to - they were marking rumors as 'wrong' when they were clearly true at a time).
 
Because so many people are interested and thirsty for rumors (for eg. look at the 'ITK' accounts) the BBC, Sky and The Times have succumbed to lowering their reporting standards. They report it as a rumor, but that is what the other papers have been doing this entire time. As I said, the sources are narrowing and they are all starting to look like each other.

*edit* I feel my point here has been lost, at least on one person. My point isn't to determine who is a good source and who is a bad source, I am actually arguing against that in saying that the football media landscape has been through a tremendous shakeup in the past 12-24 months. The sites are becoming more and more like each other with what used to be considered 'top quality' sites are now running rumors, while what were considered bad newspaper or poor sites are now running good journalism. They are starting to meet in the middle. Some of the very things that the tabloids used to get criticized for are now what The Guardian and The BBC are doing - but for some reason they get a pass because they label it a a rumor while the other sites do the same thing and its seen as evil. The BBC rumor roundup and The Guardian rumor pages are nothing more than repeating the same things that everybody else is reporting. You dont know if Sir Alex Ferguson himself is picking up the phone and calling journalists at The Sun, or anywhere else.

**the 'better' papers are doing things that the tabloids used to be criticized for while those that were typically were known as 'bad' papers are now doing some decent journalism with good stories. you can't give The Guardian and The BBC a free pass on posting rumors just because they tag it - that is exactly what the other papers do as well. Even the worst journalist can be a great source of news. the clubs use the big papers to plant stories, as do agents. its better to understand how the media works and judge stories by content - thinking for yourself - rather than accepting the POV of someone else as to what is a bad source or good source**

The best way to read news is t downvoting o know the journalists - not the newspapers. Judge every story for its content, who it is coming from and how it is presented. Once you know how the football media work (that agents and players plant stories, that clubs rarely leak their interest themselves, etc) then it opens up the whole world to better interpretation. Instead of a story linking Carroll to West Ham you should be asking yourself who at the Mirror wrote this story, where did it come from, why is it being written? These guys aren't sitting around in the office and pulling names out of a hat - like what a lot of people suggest or think they do. 

tl;dr judge stories for their content.

&gt; (i.e. the Mkhitaryan has a third party ownership surprise 'exclusive' by the Mirror)

am I missing something here, google says they were first and have them at the top of the cluster?

**edit:** I assume you think this means the Mkhitaryan story is false. I [respond to that here](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1gr6e3/mirror_there_are_no_plans_for_a_medical_for/can8qzf?context=3). My interpretation of the rules in this subreddit of how stories are judge for quality is as follows:

 * rumors that are good for liverpool = true
 * rumors that are bad for liverpool = false

when Mkhitaryan was linked to Liverpool via the Mirror there were links to them here in the subreddit. as soon as they report on an issue they are 'lazy journalists looking for pageviews'. a quick [scan of all the submission from the mirror](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/search?q=subreddit%3ALiverpoolFC+site%3Amirror.co.uk&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on) and you begin to spot the pattern (also interesting to note in that list of stories that Simon Mignolet to Liverpool from the Mirror was downvoted - 3 days later and from the Echo is gets upvoted).

**edit**: sorry i'm catching on now to what has happen. so somebody submitted a link to twitter which was a link to the mirror story about Mkhitaryan hitting snags (you are supposed to submit original links where there is one as per reddit rules but we will ignore that for now), this prompted downvotes since ""we"" don't want this story to be true, which has prompted a new (well, its not new - this comes up all the time) thread about which sources are good and which sources are bad, is that right?

there is a reason why reddit doesn't ban sites (except for spam). its because the community here is supposed to consist of people who are of average intelligence, or better, who can interpret a story and content for themselves and summize what is good and what is bad. this falls apart in the little cliques such as the subreddits built around teams since there is an internal drive to want to make stories true or false through upvotes and downvotes. In a place like /r/soccer this is balanced out because you have fans from other teams who counterbalance the bias from supporters, but in a sub like this it really snowballs to the point where the main stories here on the main page are nothing but attempting to re-affirm a biased one-eyed view of the world

To make this worse the idea here is that now do we not only downvote the stories that we don't want to be true, but we ban or not submit the people who publish these stories - *further* reaffirming the one-eyed world view. This subreddit is in * desperate* need of alternate viewpoints, submitting counter-views should be encouraged, so there can be threads of debate rather than threads of 'ITS HAPPENIG'.

As the readers here are supposed to be smart enough to judge content on their own let them do that. Don't ask other people which sites are considered good and which sites are considered bad. Most people who go on about bad or poor sites don't even know why they don't like those sites, they just know its cool for them to hate them (this sub must be 50%+ Americans who wouldn't know the UK media landscape but have picked up on good guys vs bad guys via the Brits in here). 

As I mentioned in my original comment above the way the football media works is a lot more complicated than good guys at The Guardian who are mini woodward and burnsteins playing out *all the presidents men* vs the bad guys at the red-top tabloids throwing darts at a board. There are very good reasons to not read some of these sites or to take some of what they write with skepticism - but the reason isn't that someone organized them into good guys and bad guys on our behalf, and it definitely isn't because the stories they publish are bad for LiverpoolFC And do not fit into my biased fan-based worldview.

true,nikcub,lfc68,null,"There are two things that are possible here: 

a) Liverpool did know about the third party owners and thought they had a deal with them, but one or more of them is asking for better terms late. Reneging on a deal late in the process and asking for a little more is very common in transfers, especially those that look easy.

b) Liverpool didn't know about the third-party owners as Shakhtar were hiding it from them. I believe this is much more likely. Because of the EPL ban on third-parties and the new UEFA committee attempting to regulate them a lot of clubs are hiding their third-party ownership deals from other clubs. For eg. the Atletico chairman insisted in the media that the club own 100% of Falcao (they said the same of Aguero as well). The *only* club that is transparent in third-party ownership is Porto. Even other public company clubs aggregate assets in their balance sheets to hide third party ownership. 

Liverpool are not allowed to deal with the third-party owners in the transfer deal since it is banned in the EPL. The deal would be Liverpool pay Shakhtar who then pay the third-party owners in 'off contract' deals. 

The other reason this makes more sense is that it would match the narrative that one of the owners would be upset with the deal at the last minute. For eg. Liverpool and Shakhtar reach agreement and this is reported in the media, but when Shakhtar turn around and attempt to seal the deal with third-party owners, one of the three is not happy with it. 

I can find absolutely nothing on Mkhitaryan and third-party ownership anywhere in filings, although I need a better translation of some of these docs that i've found. Considering that in our other transfer deal we were speaking to the wrong player agent, something that is simple to check as their is an open registrar of player agents at each FA and at UEFA, it wouldn't surprise me that we were not talking to all parties in this deal where third-party ownership is a lot less transparent and muddy.

There is definitely something going on here. The other concern, and I raised this in a thread here last week, is that we are leaking a lot of information from the club and it looks like it is coming from someone inside the club. It is more than one newspaper, and it is to the point now where every one of our transfers is playing out in the newspapers day-to-day.

Even if a few innocent people are wrongly convicted and executed, if each execution is deterring 1 murder, then the public isn't losing out. Providing the probability of being murdered goes down more than the probability of you being executed goes up, you're less likely to die.

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"&gt; a) she's clearly totally ignorant of Iran

do you mean ignorant *on* Iran? Obviously she is not unaware of Iran, of it's existence. Assuming you are claiming she is ignorant about Iran - what did she say that demonstrated this ignorance - or that was inaccurate? She made a number of claims about Iran, none of which I can see much of a problem with. 

&gt; and to claim you point-blank can't negotiate with Iranian leaders is pretty racist to boot.

erm, she didn't say you can't negotiate with Iran because they are a different race. She said they were committed to (amongst other things) the destruction of Israel and the end of the world...which, even if you disagree with her, isn't a racist view. 

&gt; Avoiding a war with Syria in order to go to war with Iran is madness. It's like avoiding the local sheriff in order to fight the SWAT team. Iran is a major power, and war with them will be a huge event.

I'm not disagreeing with you; but I don't see where Melanie called for war with Iran. did I miss something? (not being sarcastic here - I may have indeed missed something). 

Iran is a major power, and that I think was Melanie's point. It's a big power and a big threat, and it's playing a big role in Syria. 

&gt; So in short, she has no idea what she's talking about - and yet is happy to promote a war that will kill hundreds of thousands of people and could tear the Middle East apart... ignorant war-mongering gets me, and many others, very angry indeed.

so to repeat my above questions;

- what did she say about Iran that was inaccurate?
- where did she promote or claim we should go to war with Iran?

Here's a few of the places I like to go with my wife.  We love to eat and go out regularly, but don't like to spend too much:

[Cafe Marlayne](http://www.cafemarlayne.com/).  There's two, one large and one small.  Both are excellent, specialising in top quality ingredients cooked very well.  Never had a bad experience.  Excellent atmosphere.  Thistle street is more central, although more intimate.

[Tangs Gohan](http://www.tangsgohan.com/)  The only really authentic Japanese food in Edinburgh (my wife is Japanese and loves it here).  Mr Tang is the former head chef at Nobu in London, and has trained in Japan under some of the foremost chefs.  

[Saigon Saigon](http://www.saigonrestaurant.co.uk/) does good Dim Sum, and is centrally located, although quite casual.  I am fully aware that in the past there was an issue with health inspection, however as I eat in China often, it doesn't really bother me as comparatively standards are still excellent.  Staff are friendly and reassuringly the place is always packed with Chinese faces.  Skip the buffet and get a massive selection of Dim Sum with Tsingtao beer.  Reasonable prices.

[Amarone](http://www.amaronerestaurant.co.uk/) is an excellent Italian restaurant, again very centrally located (round the corner from Saigon Saigon).  I've never had a bad experience here, the food is delicious and the house wine is a very good standard.  The building is also very impressive indoors.

[A room in the town](http://www.aroomin.co.uk/uncategorized/a-room-in-the-town/)  My work always has its Christmas party here.  Good quality food along with great beer and reasonable prices.

Especially considering things like sanctions are pretty much maxed out already. If you have a different interpretation of that word, I'd like to hear it. 

Racism isn't simply saying 'I don't like you because of your race' it can also be, for example, focusing on something you don't like and attributing it to that race, while ignoring it in others. For example, she claimed that the Iranian leadership are waiting for the return of the Mahdi and the apocalypse and so can't be negotiated with. The trouble is, many Christian politicians in the West are also waiting for the return of Christ and the apocalypse - yet I very much doubt she says you can't negotiate with the US Republican party for these reasons. And as far as the destruction of Israel - every single Middle Eastern state is in agreement on that, including British allies such as Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Qatar... so again, why focus on Iran? In short she's clearly trying to paint the Iranian leadership as 'mad mullahs' but the only evidence she can provide are things which are prominent in other parts of the world too, even among our friends. I see this as racist.

She also made an assertion that Iran is getting a nuclear bomb, whereas the evidence for that is far from complete. She also says Iran intends to use this bomb to commit genocide against Israel... which is an insane claim to make and for which there is no evidence whatsoever (the mis-translated Ahmadinijad 'wipe off the map' quote was in reference to the Israeli regime, not the people or the land. Iran is not going to Nuke Jerusalem, the third most holiest city in Islam, especially when it knows full well it too would be nuked - anyone who thinks they will is an idiot).

Finally, she claims Iran is a threat to the UK... quite how she thinks this is way beyond me. They have no capability whatsoever to strike us militarily, the 'terrorists' they support are entirely focused on the Middle East, and they have no economic way of hurting us.

Yeah, so, it's a forum not a psychologists convention?  Why are the musings of Guardian writers, or you for that matter, worth any more than mine?

&gt; And quite frankly sex is not just a bodily function, it is something that deeply effects most people, and is ordinarily part of the basis for our closest human relationships.

Nonsense.  Sex is not the _basis_ for relationships in any way.  A moments thought will tell you that it's perfectly possible (and happens every Saturday night) that people have sex with people they are neither close to, nor have ""the closest personal relationship"" with.  In fact, your characterisation is bordering on offensive to people in relationships were some mishap of disability has denied them sex and yet they still have a loving relationship.  If your logic were true, then the parent-child relationship itself would be very different.  I'm also curious -- have you had sex with all of your closest friends?

I'm not going to dignify your ad hominem ""you must be abnormal"" crap with a response.  You don't know me, how much sex I've had, or what my relationships are like, so you're just talking out of your arse.

I'm not saying porn doesn't affect us; I'm saying that a healthy attitude to sex would mean that we consider it far less important than a great many other formative factors.

I have no idea what a ten year old girl would make of gagging, but then I'm not suggesting that parents should sit their 10 year olds down in front of the most explicit porn they can find and force them to watch it.  I'm saying that (1) you have to go looking for it, and if the child looks for it, they are already curious (2) I do not believe that it would be the psyche-destroying event that a great many nanny-staters seem to think it would be.

I watched Luke Skywalker's hand get chopped off when I was young -- presumably I should have extrapolated that my father would eventually do the same to me?  Of course it's nonsense, children that can't tell the difference between what they see on screen and reality have far greater problems than a potentially bad attitude to sex.",0,1371806329,null,0,false,0,canardr,t3_1gq3k5,t1_canardr,t1_canajl7,null,1430733997,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I have the impression that most of the people that espouse these lists of good/bad have forgotten the reasons why they don't like these sites, they just know that they are supposed to not like them.

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"&gt; As far as war goes - she repeatedly used the word 'neutralise'. I don't understand how you can interpret that in any way other than war? Especially considering things like sanctions are pretty much maxed out already. If you have a different interpretation of that word, I'd like to hear it.

neutralise needn't mean war at all. Israel attempts to neutralise the Iranian threat with computer viruses and other clandestine methods. neutralise could encompass all manner of non-violent approaches, soft-power, etc. 

&gt;  For example, she claimed that the Iranian leadership are waiting for the return of the Mahdi and the apocalypse and so can't be negotiated with

sorry, she didn't say waiting - she said they are attempting to instigate it. I'm not aware that this is what Obama is working towards in the middle east.

And her refusal to entertain negotiations was not because of their religious views, but the way their religious views informed their political intentions. Believing that you must bring about WW3, and being committed to the destruction of another state are not something you can easily negotiate around. 

&gt; In short she's clearly trying to paint the Iranian leadership as 'mad mullahs' 

hardly difficult is it. calling for the destruction of Israel, hanging gays, arresting women who aren't dressed conservatively enough, violently putting down protesters...

&gt;  I see this as racist.

well I'm afraid there's nothing racist about it, because it doesn't involve race. the term you're looking for is 'inconsistency' or 'hypocrisy', not racism. Melanie's views addressed directly the views and intentions of Iran, not their skin colour or ethnic group of Iranians in general. 

&gt; She also made an assertion that Iran is getting a nuclear bomb, whereas the evidence for that is far from complete. 

mainly because Iran won't let the UN in to check things out, but sure. 

&gt;  She also says Iran intends to use this bomb to commit genocide against Israel... which is an insane claim to make and for which there is no evidence whatsoever

I'm afraid there is infact a worrying amount of evidence. [just a few select quotes here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Israel_relations#In_the_media) - including Supreme Leader Khamenei - ""It is incorrect, irrational, pointless and nonsense to say that we are friends of Israeli people... we are on a collision course with the occupiers of Palestine and the occupiers are the Zionist regime. This is the position of our regime, our revolution and our people.""

&gt;  (the mis-translated Ahmadinijad 'wipe off the map' quote was in reference to the Israeli regime, not the people or the land. Iran is not going to Nuke Jerusalem, the third most holiest city in Islam, especially when it knows full well it too would be nuked - anyone who thinks they will is an idiot).

I'm glad you have such a clear view of future events, I wouldn't be so sure about anything Iran would or wouldn't do. whether it is a regime or a country that Iran wants wiped off the map - this is hardly helping your case. Iran clearly wants a fight with Israel, whether it intends to nuke them or not. Nuclear weapons would give them much more confidence to attack Israel. 

&gt; Finally, she claims Iran is a threat to the UK... quite how she thinks this is way beyond me. They have no capability whatsoever to strike us militarily, the 'terrorists' they support are entirely focused on the Middle East, and they have no economic way of hurting us. So in what possible way are they a threat?

I think she said they are threat to UK interests; in which she includes Israel. It is hard to imagine how a war between Iran and Israel wouldn't involve or impact the UK (and the USA), and it's no secret that Iran are one of the biggest state sponsors of terrorism worldwide.

 - Ponzi schemes require money to be flowing in always -- bitcoin does not.  It requires more users if it is to take over from the incumbent bankers, but if it stops where it is then it will be just fine (although of more limited use)
 - No one has ever promised a return on bitcoin investment
 - There is no gatekeeper creaming off as money moves from new investors to old investors
 - Ponzi schemes don't bounce.  Bitcoin has been volatile, but has had massive crashes and massive recoveries.

If a patient comes to you, as a GP, with a complaint, you look for the symptoms behind the complaint, and investigate further.

For example, a constituent wants the death penalty back. Why? Perhaps they are worried about law and order in their area.

I gave you a link to a selection of quotes from their rulers, it is quite easy to find more. 

&gt;  There is some debate as to whether they are in full-compliance with the NPT, I'll give you that, but no one thinks they have out-right broken it. The only facilities Iran has hindered access to are not nuclear facilities, but weapons facilities. We can guarantee that, as of today, Iran has not made a bomb, because the UN keeps a full check of all Iran's nuclear material.

of course we know Iran has not made a bomb- that is not the claim. the claim is they are trying to, which is hard to disagree with when Iran won't let UN inspectors into where the UN wants to go. In the latest report for example; ""The February report noted that Iran has continued to deny the IAEA access to the military site at Parchin. Citing evidence from satellite imagery that ""Iran constructed a large explosives containment vessel in which to conduct hydrodynamic experiments"". Such installation could be an indicator of nuclear weapons development. "" - [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_program_of_Iran#2007.E2.80.93present)

&gt; Disliking Israel does not mean nuking Israel. You clearly dislike Iran, but I trust - hope - that you wouldn't advocate nuking Tehran. I don't understand why you think Iran are so hell bent on war and mass-murder.

I don't dislike Iran at all; I dislike their leaders. I have friends who've had to flee Iran. But your nuking claim is a strawman; Iran doesn't need to nuke Israel to start a massive region-wide war, they just need to have the balls to do something (which they would get from nuclear weapons). 

Iran's rulers do not just 'not like Israel' - they regularly express that something has be done about Israel (the occupation). They do not just want to see the current Israeli government thrown out; they want the entire current Jewish state of Israel disillusioned and replaced (at best) and entirely destroyed or 'wiped out' at worst.

Bitcoins transfer to your wallet directly.  Your employer would just do a bitcoin transfer instead of a BACS transfer.

&gt; Also I can't see mortgage providers accepting bitcoins, or supermarkets, or utility companies, or any physical store.

Why not?  Not now of course, I understand and don't expect my electricity provider to take them -- they're nowhere near widely enough used.  But that is a chicken-and-egg problem.  Those big institutions will probably be the last to get on board with bitcoin, should it become successful.

My point remains the same though: if you want to start cutting the banks power down, you have to start looking elsewhere for the services they currently provide.  Bitcoin is the first viable competitor we have ever had to the existing banking system.

&gt; So as long as your fine starving to death on the streets use bitcoins! 

That's just hyperbole.  In fact, food is one of the areas where bitcoin is doing well.  There are restaurants that accept them, so you certainly wouldn't starve.

&gt; But seriously bitcoins are far far too unstable atm to be used as a useful currency, they're great for making a quick buck on the market but useless for actually spending them.

Exactly, but it is only volume of users that supplies stability.  So we're back to chicken-and-egg.  The way to move from instability to stability is (as I said) not to expect to move 100% to using bitcoin as your day-to-day currency.  But become aware of it, don't be dismissive, maybe buy a couple, maybe be willing to accept them if you are offered.  These are the necessary steps to killing off the banks.

Its because the population in a police state isn't controlled through punishment and enforcement, but rather the fear of punishment and enforcement. You instill fear into people and they will police each other, and even though you know it is wrong in the beginning and you are aware that the police state is turning its citizenry into an effective force against itself, through groupthink and social/peer pressure in the long term everybody convinces each other of the new normal.

However, to address your points:

&gt; Bitcoin shares most similarities with fiat currencies than it does with commodities as there is nothing tangible to hold onto.

Not entirely true.  You have a unique random number, that only you hold, a number so large that it cannot be successfully guessed.  It's not 100% tangible, but it is a real thing.

Think now about gold, nothing inherently makes it more valuable than any other mineral.  It's actually not particularly useful industrially, relative to other metals.  What it does have is a specific set of attributes: scarcity, fungability, divisibility, etc, etc.  The value of gold is inherent in those attributes.  Gold has a historic head start, but the only thing that makes it valuable is trust in the fact that it is valued by others.  Bitcoin has a specific set of attributes that coincide very much with the attributes of gold.  The only thing it's missing then is that implicit trust.  That can only be gained gradually through use.

&gt; This could make it more stable than most fiat currencies and commodities in the long run

You are absolutely right here I think.

If our legal system is so flawed that we can never come up with a case of murder, child abuse, repeated aggravated rape especially with high profile cases like Ian Huntley and Myra Hindley to name but a few, then why do we even risk locknig people up in prison which is a very inhumane process itself?

The death penalty should never be the first option but there's no harm in having it for an option. What about the potential victims that are the result of rapists that have been released?

People often say this in defence of D-notices but I think there's an argument to say that this is exactly the problem with them. 

If the notices did carry a legal imperative there would have to be certain rules that the notices themselves have to follow and they would have to be justified. As it is they can be issued whenever the government feels like subduing something in the press, pretty much without justification, usually under the handy umbrella terms ""national security"" or ""terrorism"" which get bandied about far too often. We have the official secrets act and various legislation that already protects national interests through the courts, you do have to wonder what real purpose a D-notice fulfils. Especially since they're rarely (if ever) ignored by the mainstream news outlets. After all, if the silence cannot be ordered in a court of law, how vital is it?

I've said it before and I'll say it again: just because there may be no legal response to publishing a story in the face of a D-notice does not mean that there will be no repercussion for the editor that chooses to do so. It just means that *if* there is a response will occur outside of the courts -perhaps professionally or whatever- which makes it all seem a little more sinister.

I'm not saying that all D-notices are sinister attempts at press censorship by authoritarian crazies. But I do think we should question their motives as part of a healthy democracy.

Parchin is not a nuclear facility - it is a weapons facility, the Iranian equivalent of Area 51. Under the terms of the NPT, Iran has no obligation whatsoever to allow inspectors into Parchin. Their position is that they did so once, and later realised the CIA had taken the opportunity to use the inspection for nefarious purposes - unsurprisingly they are reluctant to allow it again. I don't know if this is a lie or not, but it is a perfectly reasonable explanation for their actions... so I strongly dispute it's hard to disagree that Iran is in fact making a bomb.

Haha. It just sounds like you're trying to convince yourself otherwise by using a very strict definition of a ponzi scheme. Bitcoin is defined by how people use it.

&gt;Ponzi schemes require money to be flowing in always -- bitcoin does not. It requires more users if it is to take over from the incumbent bankers, but if it stops where it is then it will be just fine (although of more limited use)

Bitcoin it's self does not but the current way in which bitcoin is being used by the vast majority of users does. Reddit and the whole internet is full of the idea of bitcoin as an investment not as currency.

No of course not. That doesn't stop people expecting one.

Ponzi, Tulips, bitcoins whatever you want to call it, the principals are all the same.

&gt;Let me be clear: Bitcoin is not an investment. If all you want is to make money from it, well good luck to you, but that's not the goal. The goal is to free us from needing the existing banking system.

The 'proper' solution would be identical to how these things work in the software world. You create an API key that allows a service certain access to your data, this access is limited in various ways. One simple one would be that it's able to access your finances but *not* transfer them. If banks did this, money management stuff would become a lot simpler.

One mitigating factor is that with some banks (like the coop) you have to use a device you enter your card into if you want to pay someone new. That way if someone accesses your account they can cause problems but can't transfer money to anybody you've not sent money before.

""It is incorrect, irrational, pointless and nonsense to say that we are friends of Israeli people... **we are on a collision course with the occupiers of Palestine and the occupiers are the Zionist regime. This is the position of our regime**, our revolution and our people.""[75]

""In August 2012, a senior cleric and Tehran's provisional Friday Prayers Leader Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami, speaking about Qods Day, called for the annihilation of the ""Zionist regime,"" emphasizing that the spread of the ""Islamic Awakening"" in the Middle East ""heralds annihilation of the Zionist regime.""[77]""


""On September 22, 2012, General Mohammad Ali Jafari, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, said that eventually a war with Israel would soon break out, during which Iran would eradicate Israel, which he referred to as a ""cancerous tumor.""[80]""

you keep saying every Middle Eastern state expresses similar notions with regards to Israel - can you give some examples? any that match the rhetoric above?

The focus on Iran is that they are led by radical Islamic extremists, state sponsors of terror, who are flouting UN instructions on nuclear weapons.  

&gt;  I don't know if this is a lie or not, but it is a perfectly reasonable explanation for their actions... 

seriously? The UN wants in to this facility to see whether Iran are making nuclear weapons, and you defend Iran's stance because it may hurt Iran in the future? no shit, that's the point. If you're making nuclear bombs you are in serious trouble. (and you already are, considering the various UN resolutions against you). 

&gt; . I don't think there's enough evidence to make a conclusion either way, and my personal hunch is that they aren't.

well that's very reassuring. Thankfully for us (and Israel specifically) international decisions about nuclear war aren't based upon your (or my) personal hunches. 

&gt;  But I see your position (and Melanie Phillips') as helping create the right climate for a war.

you don't see Iran as playing any role in the 'climate for war'? the rhetoric against israel, the violation of UN resolutions, the refusal to open it's weapons facilities...

&gt; We've already sanctioned Iran to the hilt, so why do you guys need to keep castigating and encouraging 'neutralising' Iran. What more can we do except war?

let's look at this for the moment; your view is that 'we've already done everything we can to Iran and they still won't back down, so that's it, we shouldn't do anything else'. Which is staggering, considering we're talking about a possible nuclear threat and a war in the middle east. you don't just stop dealing with an issue because it may involve some possible military intervention. If Iran gets the bomb it will *certainly* lead to military action, either by them, or Israel, or the USA, or us, or all of the above. 

I understand it's comfortable to have your head in the sand and deny the intentions of mad men. but it's simply stupid. 

&gt; Frankly I see you as a murderous warmonger who has a blood-lust for Middle Easterners. 

including Jews? attempting to deal with issues does not make one a warmonger.

If the signature is fraudulent then the courier is liable.

The process would be:

1. Customer files complaint against courier and/or with police
2. Police investigate
3. Does signature match? (no? default finding for recipient)
4. Compensation given

I've got **nothing** against Carroll *personally*, but in hindsight, it would've been so much better if we'd never bought him in the first place, no matter what the price. We attempted to adapt our style of play to suit him, and we bought players in a few months later to further cement this new style. Of them, only Henderson has recently looked close to repaying our valuation of him, and we've changed our style once again to suit the whole team, not just one member of it.

I still think back with shock and a sense of 'what could have been' if we hadn't spent that money. The decision to sanction that sort of money still baffles me, although I obviously understand that our cards were laid out on the table for all (Newcastle) to see when we sold Torres with just hours of the window remaining. It would've been much better (again, with the benefit of hindsight) to have kept that money for 6 months and played a more natural style of football, providing Suarez with chances to shine.

Who knows. Perhaps if we'd sat on that money for 6 more months, we would've bought Carroll in the summer anyway. No one can say one way or the other unless we perhaps ask Kenny himself.

true,codeduck,southafrica,Saffer at large,"Network packets leave traces.  Governments have revenue and taxation treaties.  All they need to do is lean on the ISPs hosting the wallets and they own the network data.  From there it's simply graphing the networks of interest.

Cashing out the bitcoins for a real world currency requires a deposit into your bank account, or into the account of whoever is exchanging the bitcoins for currency.  Unless they're a black market exchange they are mostly likely required to report all currency exchanges to the revenue authority of the government.  If they're a black market exchange they will be identified at some point due to a security slip or penetration operation, and then the security services of whatever country the exchange resided in own your data.

Your wire transfer will similarly reported.  Someone at the revenue authority will see this trail and go 'Oh look, potential money laundering.  Lets get their bank transaction history and internet traffic records'.  

From there, they can identify the exchanges you've been using and the probable sites of your wallets.  Been using Tor?  That's a black mark that will make them very interested in you.  Certainly in the UK they don't need to identify the destination; all they need to do is show a reasonable suspicion of money laundering and HMRC and the Police are going to make your life interesting.  

I say again - Bitcoins are only anonymous because they are not yet of high enough volume transactionally to warrant this sort of monitoring.  If their popularity builds, that will change.  Anyway, regardless of whether individual coins are anonymous or not, the traffic in the bitcoin network is not anonymous, and it is that flow of packets that will sink you, not the fact that you paid someone in Bolivia $5 once.",0,1371814230,null,0,false,0,canbscg,t3_1gs85e,t1_canbscg,t1_canbd4l,null,1430733512,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I'm not asserting that there is no effect - which is wild conjecture (and pretty much contrary to every other wide cultural experiences people have)

&gt; Nonsense. Sex is not the basis for relationships in any way. A moments thought will tell you that it's perfectly possible (and happens every Saturday night) that people have sex with people they are neither close to, nor have ""the closest personal relationship"" with. In fact, your characterisation is bordering on offensive to people in relationships were some mishap of disability has denied them sex and yet they still have a loving relationship. If your logic were true, then the parent-child relationship itself would be very different. I'm also curious -- have you had sex with all of your closest friends?

A childish mis-representation of what i said. 

You said it's a 'bodily function' and nothing more - and that is *total nonsense*. Citation: the whole of civilised human history where we have all spent an inordinate amount of time pursuing, enjoying, missing, crying over, laughing about sex. Do we do the same for taking a piss?

&gt; you must be abnormal

not something i said

&gt; a healthy attitude to sex

a healthy attitude to sex != exposure to lots of pornography from a young age - who would say that!??

&gt; (1) you have to go looking for it, and if the child looks for it, they are already curious

Children are curious about everything - but they are clearly not always in a position to make sound judgements about this stuff. Additionally porn advertising is not restricted to porn sites only. The reason why I suddenly care about this is because my nephew found some stuff online when he was 10 years old and it really freaked him out - not seriously. But I am wondering what happens when kids find this stuff - its everywhere

&gt; (2) I do not believe that it would be the psyche-destroying event that a great many nanny-staters seem to think it would be.

Is anybody saying that or are you just talking hyperbole? People are worried about the ubiquitous hardcore imagery online, and how it affects children. Similar to how ubiquitous fashion imagery is widely regarded to help push young women to unhealthy body image - which is definitely a 'thing'. My point is - will hardcore imagery have a similar effect?

&gt; I watched Luke Skywalker's hand get chopped off when I was young -- presumably I should have extrapolated that my father would eventually do the same to me?

I think maybe you still are a child if this is your reasoned argument - which of course is not answering any kind of assertion that I have made. 

&gt; Of course it's nonsense, children that can't tell the difference between what they see on screen and reality have far greater problems than a potentially bad attitude to sex.

You *literally* have no idea how the mind of a child works. It shows.

strawman. The danger is not an Iranian invasion, but a missile strike or other small attacks leading to more. Iran is already the major sponsor of Hamas and hezbollah, so it is already engaged in proxy wars against Israel. 

&gt; Ignore the words of the shit-stirring power hungry cretins on both sides who occasionally call for a war. 

that's all very well, but do you honestly believe there can be no such thing as a genuine threat from a state like Iran? It seems to me that even if Iran admitted it was building a bomb, and pointing it straight at Israel, we would still hear the same arguments from people like yourself (""it's all war mongering from the USA etc etc"").

&gt;  Their actual foreign policies have remained the same for decades - no big mobilisation, no overt attacks. They both occasionally bomb each other covertly but it's not likely to escalate.

I think once Iran goes nuclear it is likely to escalate. Plus it only takes one spark to light the fire.

true,Bragzor,null,null,"&gt;This is true, but I think the assumption is getting to be a bad one, especially when the country you are extraditing someone to will not guarantee not to extradite them further.

As has been pointed out a number of times already, counties do generally not make decisions about hypothetical extraditions to countries they generally consider safe to extradite to. In this case, that's not really relevant though, since any further extradition from Sweden to a third country would need the approval of the UK, so no such promise would ever be needed.

&gt;I also think that if you can't normally hold someone for more than 24 hours without charging (and so presenting at least some evidence) then it is crazy to be able to extradite them with the same standard being met.

In the UK, it's 24 hours before you're charged, up to 96 if it's a serious crime (needs approval from the court), and 336 if it's terrorism. After that you have to be charged, which means being informed about details of the offence for which they are being charged.

In Sweden it's at noon on the third day after the arrest that the prosecutor has to decide if to go forward. After that, you can be kept in ""pretrial detention"" if the crime you're suspected of is punishable by at least one year in prison, and if you're considered a flight risk or if it's likely that you would interfere with the investigation. This detention is re-evaluated every fortnight, but there is theoretically no upper limit. Please not that there is no direct equivalence to being charged.

&gt;then it is crazy to be able to extradite them with the same standard being met.

Again, no, the extradition is not part of the criminal proceedings, so it would be absurd to include evidence in them. As I said, they assumption is that the case is legitimate, and if it's doubted that it would be, then the extradition could be denied.

&gt;Extradition seems to have become a get-around for reasonable habius corpus and all that faff if you ask me.

Habius corpus has nothing to do with it. Extraditions is a get-around for people fleeing the country, and thus preventing the workings of the judiciary.

I know that three hundred years of constitutional liberties aren't very trendy in the U.K, but I am thankful that there are at least a few people to stand up and fight for freedom in the States. 

Also, you should actually consider what you are proposing: a single payer healthcare system cannot possibly work when a nation's population size is 313,900,000, 6 times ours (in England)! This is why healthcare provision, like every other devolved policy was supposed to be left to the States. The parallel would be supporting a single healthcare system for the whole of Europe, instead of leaving it up to every sovereign state to formulate their own, based on what is correct for them.

So much British comment on American politics is in complete ignorance  of the size, population, diversity and difference between American states. It is not a homogeneous nation, but rather a union of 50.

For some reason you took that far too personally and attacked me. You can't drag the conversation through the mud like that and then complain that I am playing dirty three comments later when I decide to poke you back a little.

My point on The Guardian is this: the *other* newspapers also report the same stories as rumor. The Mirror have a section each day called 'Rumor Roundup' as well. There is *no difference* between these sites. They both have a very low bar to what they will publish.

Just because you find The Guardian witty and satirical does not excuse what they are doing - they are playing the same dirty games as the other newspapers, they are just getting a pass from a lot of people because they are The Guardian and the other sites are tabloids. 

The Guardian's rumor mill may have started as a satirical look at other newspapers, but now its just another rumor mill, with a very low barrier to what they would publish.

If Iran goes nuclear, the threat of escalation ends. Alternatively, their current president has a lot of experience in nuclear disarmament negotiations, and he might well agree to end the program completely. The most fraught time is the halfway house we're in now.

There is no real danger of accidental escalation in the mean time, and the population of both countries largely wants peace.

Banks don't exist purely to safeguard money. All the investment banking crap aside, banks by any definition *are* supposed to invest money by giving out loans and offer some sort of return on investments. Both of those functions are quite well incentivised by a desire for profit. The problem is when they start taking ridiculous risks, become too big to fail, and when senior individuals don't feel any responsibility because they can profit it the good times while jumping ship in the bad.

&gt; As for regulations, banks can simply employ wizards to invent new ways of running themselves into the ground.

Kind of. However, if a regulator is prepared to be heavy handed then they do ultimately hold the balance of power. Further, plenty of other professions are well regulated - perhaps most relevantly the legal industry, which you would think *more than any* would have the capacity to squirm away from regulation.

on the contrary, it's based on exactly what you've said. 

You don't believe Iran represents a genuine threat. what would it take for them to represent a genuine threat? is it even possible for them to be a threat, in your view? 

because from where I'm sitting, it doesn't seem like they could ever be a threat, no matter what they said, did, or said their intentions were. 

&gt; If Iran goes nuclear, the threat of escalation ends. Alternatively, their current president has a lot of experience in nuclear disarmament negotiations, and he might well agree to end the program completely. The most fraught time is the halfway house we're in now.

well Israel won't let them go nuclear. the situation we're in now is very dangerous, because it means war could break out any moment. If we don't take Iran seriously, whilst Israel does, it's even more dangerous than actually engaging with Iran or taking them seriously. 

&gt; If there is a war, it will be because one administration steps far out of its way to deliberately provoke or attack - and for the reasons previous, it's unlikely to be Iran who does that.

well Iran doesn't need to do anything directly, they just let Hamas and Hezbollah do it for them. but that won't stop Israel from taking Iran's facilities out, and starting a massive clusterfuck.

&gt;In respect of deposits, an eligible depositor is entitled to claim up to £85,000. For joint accounts each account holder is treated as having a claim in respect of their share so, for a joint account held by two eligible depositors, the maximum amount that could be claimed would be £85,000 each (making a total of £170,000). The £85,000 limit relates to the combined amount in all the eligible depositor’s accounts with the credit union, including their share of any joint account, and not to each separate account.

If you were the gym owner for this hypothetical gym, I would be very wary as you would be trying to change embedded behaviours; which ultimately leads to people making unhealthy choices. Of course there would be a small segment of which overweight becomes an issue due to genetics - however the majority is due to unhealthy choices.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/harry-potter/8214522/Harry-Potter-star-beaten-after-meeting-non-Muslim-man.html

&gt; Victim Afshan Azad, 22, played Padma Patil, a classmate of the teenage wizard, in the blockbuster Hollywood films based on the children's books by JK Rowling.
&gt;
&gt; She was assaulted and branded a ''prostitute'' after meeting a young Hindu man, a relationship which brought anger from her father, Abul Azad, 53, and brother, Ashraf, 28, Manchester Crown Court heard.

You can see a recurring theme in Islam - particularly in the UK - that they keep 'their' women under very right control with threats of violence and actual violence if they date non Muslims. 

Meanwhile Muslim men see non Muslims women - particularly secular whites - as being easy prey.

The fact that people like you deny this a problem is genuinely baffling to me. 

Or look at this case

http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2011/12/07/female-gang-who-attacked-woman-spared-jail_n_1133734.html

&gt; A female gang who shouted “kill the white slag” while attacking a woman in Leicester city centre have been spared jail after a judge heard that the Muslim girls were not used to drinking alcohol.
&gt;
&gt; Rhea Page was set upon while walking to a taxi rank with her boyfriend in June last year. The attackers dragged the victim to the ground by her hair then beat her with kicks and punches.
&gt;
&gt; Page’s boyfriend, 23-year-old Lewis Moore, was also attacked as he tried to fend off the four women.
&gt;
&gt; Sisters Ambaro Maxamed, 24, Ayan Maxamed, 28, and Hibo Maxamed, 24, along with their cousin Ifrah Nur, 28, were convicted of causing actual bodily harm.
&gt;
&gt; During the trial the court heard that Ambaro Maxamed called Page a ""white bitch"" then pulled the hair, forcing her to the floor.
&gt;
&gt; The judge decided that the attack was not racially motivated.

If the roles had been reversed and a white gang shouted 'kill the black bitch' when attacking a Somali, do you think the attack would have be declared racially motivated?",0,1371818420,null,0,false,0,cancikm,t3_1gs85e,t1_cancikm,t1_cancdus,null,1430733169,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,InfernoZeus,lfc68,,"&gt;We're also not going to pay £10m for a backup GK.

I'm not sure I agree.

First of all, you need to consider him a future starting GK. He wouldn't be coming in to always be a backup GK.

Secondly, if we don't bring in a new GK this summer, and Pepe leaves next summer, finding a replacement for a reasonable fee will be much harder, as all the teams will know we desperately need a keeper because we just lost our starting GK.

Thirdly, we could buy him this summer, and loan him back out to Sunderland (or elsewhere) for the next year, letting him gain experience, leaving Pepe as our starting GK, but at the same time securing our future GK starting next summer.

&gt;Mignolet is 24, about to be 25, we're not going to loan him out like Courtois who's 21.

Goalkeepers are usually much older than other starting players. The fact that Courtois is 21 and is playing amazingly for a top team is an outlier, and shouldn't be considered normal. 

He is also just about the number one GK talent right now (in terms of potential), so to negatively criticize someone else because they don't match up to him makes no sense. There's no way we can get someone as good as him, so instead we need to focus on getting someone as close as possible.

United seem to be so succesful recently almost due to sheer will power (and rvp). But with fergie and Chile's gone, I think that mindset will dwindle. Outside of that, I would t be surprised to see rvp get hurt/fade a bit. He's not exactly young and injuries ha e always hampered him. Outside of that, their defense looks weak.

*But, it’s far too simplistic an extrapolation – the figures haven’t been constant for 15 years (they’ve gone down), and it takes the worst case scenario – half of 500,000 for 15 years, when it could have been half, or even less, of 250,000 for 15 years.*

*What’s worse is that he makes a causal link when there is none. He can’t claim that by not providing the rice the blindness and deaths have occurred, as we don’t know what would have happened had the rice been provided.*

*It’s also the case that the problem, according to health experts, is a lack of Vitamin A, not of golden rice.*

*FactCheck asked Allen Foster, professor of international eye health at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, whether ophthamologists working internationally had considered the use of golden rice to combat blindness caused by Vitamin A.*

*He said: “Over the last 20 years there has been a reduction in blindness from Vitamin A deficiency due to better education and the provision of vitamin A with immunisation programmes.*

*“Golden Rice has more vitamin A than conventional white rice, however it needs to be accepted by the communities and families in which vitamin A deficiency occurs.*

**“There are locally available foods which have vitamin A including green leafy vegetables and some fruits. However often mothers do not know that they need to supplement breast feeding with these solid foods.”**

*It’s also worth pointing out that it was only later versions of golden rice which were thought to contain enough beta carotene to have an effect. So even if golden rice had been available 15 years ago, it would have been an early version that was scientifically proven to be less effective in eliminating Vitamin A deficiency.*

**The verdict**

*Mr Paterson has been misleading on a number of counts.*

I could see him playing as a 3rd man in a 4-3-3 midfield, or, if Sandro or Mousa get injured, as part of the pivot in a 4-2-3-1. The little I've seen of him (confed cup), he looks like a good ball-winner with a decent work-rate. He doesn't look like the type of player who will play the defence-splitting 40m passes ala Modric, but he recycles the ball well and has at least at times shown that he can run well with the ball due to his physique (reminds me a bit of Dembele in that sense).

Now, do I want us to sign him? Yes, without a doubt. I think another midfielder has to be one of our top priorities this summer, almost as important as signing a striker. When Sandro was injured, we became way to reliant on Dembele who played nearly every match for us as long as he was free of injury. Parker doesn't really cut it anymore IMO, and while Huddlestone had a few good matches for us towards the end of the season I still think he's way to stationary to be a good option for us.

I would certainly argue that, no matter how bad the deal was for us, it was worse for Chelsea.

I still think Carroll will make a decent England CF as time goes on. I expect there might even be times when we wish we could have kept him.

Once they were nationalised you would want to split them up immediately but once that's done the market would work to lower prices and at that point nationalisation is not necessary. You can split them up via other legislation. Nationalisation is often a good option where direct competition is hard or where people's welfare could compromised to save a bit of cash but that doesn't make the service cheaper, it merely means the government is willing to shell out a bit more money even if its just to make people more comfortable  (the NHS is a good example) but in the case of finances competition probably best.

&gt; Moral nihilism (also known as ethical nihilism) is the meta-ethical view that nothing is intrinsically moral or immoral. For example, a moral nihilist would say that killing someone, for whatever reason, is neither inherently right nor inherently wrong. Moral nihilists consider morality to be constructed, a complex set of rules and recommendations that may give a psychological, social, or economical advantage to its adherents, but is otherwise without universal or even relative truth in any sense

How this affects the question you asked is that my point is I dont see killing people as ""wrong"" in the absolute sense. Only in the relative sense that it is beneficial to societies to protect innocents or rather senseless slaughter offers no benefit. So to kill a convicted felon who presents a threat to society?

If you take a life to save a life, there's no net loss of lives.

Effort should obviously be made to ensure you're only executing murderers, but if you end up executing some innocent people then general public doesn't actually lose out. Of course the individuals lose out, and so do their families, but so do the victims of murderers and their families.

If you take the goal of the justice system's approach to murder as preventing the loss of human life, and the death penalty has a deterrence effect sufficient to prevent more deaths than it causes, then it's a positive thing. If the death penalty doesn't have a sufficient deterrence effect then it's a negative thing.

That's ridiculously simplistic.

Laws don't work very well when they put a very high sentence on a very low chance of getting caught doing something rewarding. There will always be outliers who take that kind of risk.

The point of regulation is you can control the mechanisms, procedure, and details of the bank such that those risks/incentives/problems never arise in the first place. As an extreme example, you could prevent bonuses for good performance and require salary penalties for bad performance.

When it comes down to it, nationalising is just an extreme form of regulation. There is literally nothing you can accomplish with nationalising that can't be accomplished with sufficient regulation - but the latter is less of a sledge-hammer approach.

&gt; Something as crucial and fundamental as banking should be the last industry to leave in private hands.

The importance of banks is for investing in private enterprise. Banks are one of the most fundamental organs of capitalism, which is where they derive their importance from. State controlled banks and thus investment would be a centrally planned economy.

Both types were being mentioned in the same sentence along with issues like darknets and encryption.  

There was also a complete lack of technical knowledge on display.  Everyone involved in the discussion seemed to be under the impression that a) illegal porn is being traded openly on the web, and that b) the ISPs should be doing something about it.  

At the end of the discussion, the BBC journalist suggested to the government spokeswoman that the ISPs were ""dragging their feet over porn"", and the government woman agreed.  I've rarely seen such an uninformed, one-sided and technologically ignorant discussion on the BBC.

What I suspect is happening here is that several different groups are pursuing their agendas simultaneously, combining together to make common cause.  You've got organisations like the Internet Watch Foundation who want to sell products and services to the authorities and the ISPs; ""family values"" (read: religious fundamentalist) groups who are attempting to push their narrow view of morality on the nation (and who may want a slice of the IWF's funding); shit-stirring tabloid newspapers;  Conservative MPs seeking to increase the government's powers over the internet and Labour MPs who feel trapped into providing a ""me too"" response.

true,Apwnalypse,null,null,"As much as I like him, he knows very little about the housing market.

I think fundamentally we have to question some parts of our home owning culture. The idea that everyone should want to be on the house market is based on the assumption that the value of housing will generally rise faster than inflation / wages: otherwise investing money in housing is less profitable than putting that money in a bank account or shares.

But let's think about what that means: say property prices go up by 10% above inflation. If I own a £100,000 house, I make £10,000 and I pat myself on the back. But someone who owns a buy to let empire of £1m, makes £100,000 and the sheikh who own £10m of flats in london makes a million. The problem with building an economy around housing instead of jobs is that one person can only work one job, but can own lots of property. And in fact, if I don't own any property, rising property prices make me poorer because all that extra wealth drives up the cost of living.

And isn't it basically so undeniable as to be tautology, that when property prices rise faster than inflation or wages, the haves get richer in comparison to the have nots? Even those of us who own houses, need to stop seeing rising house prices as good news, because rising house prices are one of the biggest drivers of inequality.

The fact is that the market has failed. A properly functioning market increases supply to meet increasing demand, but the housing market does the opposite. Once again we are asking the state to pick up the pieces for the failure of the private sector, and going to the government and demanding they build more affordable housing. But how can we seriously expect the ruling class of this country (who own most of the land and property) to support a mass house building programme, when such a programme would cause the value of their assets to fall?

What is needed instead is to change the fundamental economic conditions governing land and property. Despite soaring rents and house prices, we all every day, walk past abandoned homes in great locations, abandoned petrol forecourts that never get developed, great brownfield sites that go underdeveloped because they are owned by supermarkets and landbanks who never develop them because they just want to stop a rival from making use of them, or because they would rather have a piece of land as asset making them money, than make a large payoff for developing it and selling it off.

All these things happen because fundamentally, land costs nothing to keep once you own it outright, and without ongoing costs, there is no opportunity cost to wasting land. 

That's what needs to be changed: we need to shift the burden of taxation away from wages and onto property ownership. The mansion tax and 10p tax rate is a great start by milliband, but we need to do more. We should allow councils to charge higher rates of council tax to vacant properties and undeveloped land. Suddenly their owners will find themselves running at a loss and be forced to either make use of them or sell them on to those that will.

But we need to go further. We should extend these policies into a national Land Value Tax on all land and properties, and use the proceeds to fund cuts to VAT and more importantly, an end to all income taxation for those on the minimum wage. These policies will restore demand to the economy, build more houses, and lower rents in the long term. Not only do I believe that these measures will fix the British economy, I believe that there will be no long term recovery until they are implemented.

Thankyou for reading this. You can learn more about land value tax [here](http://www.landvaluetax.org/what-is-lvt/)

Cut wages, you decrease consumer spending. If they cut benefits too much, they will turn cities with high unemployment into disaster areas.

It's a tragedy if they're truly remorseful for what they've done, and I'd be hoping the court would show them mercy, but if not their death is still a result of their actions.

We know from those that survive that many who jump to their deaths off bridges are remorseful and hit the water regretting their decision to jump. We try to prevent them doing this, but once they've jumped the consequences are a law of nature.

We try to prevent someone breaking the law, but once they've done so justice is an impartial result of those actions. If we could save bridge jumpers by repealing the law of gravity, we shouldn't because of the effects on the rest of life.

When framing law's we're attempting to create mechanisms beneficial to society while attempting to respect individuals freedom, and so while deaths are regrettable and undeserved, a law that permits the deaths of people who choose certain actions isn't something I find objectionable when it's beneficial to the wider community.

In the same way I don't agree with the current war on drugs prohibition from an economict viewpoint, I think this is also wrong.  If people are producing content for any kind of gain, be it money or emotional (look how big my gang of people telling me I'm great is!), you solve the problem by removing the consumers.  If you remove a drug dealler, you have just made it more attractive for someone else to fill their shoes, the demand is still there.

The same is true with this, the government has pushed the use of TOR by censorship, the downside to this is filtering,shutting down, controlling it is really rather difficult.

If they could find a way of reducing the consumers, there might be less interest in people producing this.  Making help available for people who turn themselves in, rather than criminal prosecution (again similar to most sensible drugs policies) appears an obvious awnser.

Trying to block the distrubution is pointless, but when they are been created in areas outside of juristiction, it is very hard to prevent them from being made.

true,SkyPilotOne,eng-GreaterLondon,LBB&amp;D,"&gt; Do you know what amoralism is?

 
&gt;a·mor·al  (-môrl, -mr-)
adj.

&gt;1.  Not admitting of moral distinctions or judgments; neither moral nor immoral.

&gt;2.  Lacking moral sensibility; not caring about right and wrong.
[Source](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/amoralism)

Problem is I see all you people that are claiming to conform to the first sense as either mistaking their own moral position as amoral as it does not conform to the moral values they see about them or conforming to the second sense but not being self-aware enough to understand that this is the case.

Even if you don't see killing people as wrong in the absolute sense your decision to value ""innocents"" above ""felons"" shows that you are making a series of value judgements which equates to some sort of moral system. 

Furthermore, you seem to be tending towards the absolutist end of the spectrum that you claim to reject; the term ""innocents"" both denotes and connotes an absolute not a relative state and likewise a single class of felon, ranged in binary opposition suggests the position that one is either entirely innocent or guilty.

true,themorningmoon,smith,Smith,"1. It's been a while since I've watched that story arc, honestly. I can see your point, but River is kind of a rebel as well.
2. I strongly disagree with your implication that Amy doesn't develop. [Here's an excellent essay](http://savvyliterate.tumblr.com/post/30682203092/why-i-think-moffat-got-the-infertility-issue-right) on the fertility issue - I know it's not exactly what you were talking about, but it does show that she most certainly does grow. She used to have commitment issues - hence kissing the Doctor - but she grows out of that, ending her story arc by giving up traveling on the TARDIS to be with her husband - *of her own free will*. Try to imagine Series 5 Amy doing that. As to her life revolving around two men - well, one of them caused some serious psychological issues in her, and the other is her husband, who she chooses to be with. She had a female best friend growing up, and River is certainly a huge part of her life. It's not like she always needs men to save her or anything - Amy is *badass.*
3. Vastra and Jenny - they're from Victorian times, so I think it would be much stranger if people reacted like ""Oh, an interspecies lesbian couple. What's for tea?"" Their relationship is remarked upon when necessary (and by the way, they don't seem to mind - they rather delight in the reactions they get) but it isn't as if they're walking around going ""Ohhh, we're *soooo* lesbian! Look at us!"" Their relationship is loving and quite touching (tNotD).
4. Again, it's been a while since I've watched that story arc, but it's been made pretty clear that River comes and goes as she pleases - so being locked in a prison really isn't  a big deal to her. As for being saved in the computer - there was very little time to act, and the Doctor could tell that she was going to be very important in his life and they had some kind of relationship (even if he didn't know exactly what it was) and so he did the only thing he could think to do to save her. And she doesn't exactly seem to be unhappy in the computer. We don't know if those are her kids or not, by the way. And the Doctor has been ""nothing but crap"" to her? That's a hyperbole that I don't think is warranted by what we've seen of their relationship.

I was warned about the Moffat era before I began watching it; from how people described it, it sounded downright unwatchable.

We were overrun and couldn't keep possession OR move the ball past the halfway mark. He wasn't as good as he was pre-injury but thats only because he was world class last season. Muscle isn't everything. I remember last season he was taking the ball off Yaya Toure and David Silva. Every tackle he came into, he won, and won possession as well. Even this season he has made critical interruptions and been extremely important for the team. Physicality isn't necessary for a defender. it helps, but it shouldn't be the defining trait of a defender. Look at Koscielny for Arsenal. He's tiny, but he's a class defender because of his anticipation and tenacity. Its the same with Lucas. We definitely do need cover for him though, but not a replacement.
