Dortmund is a selling club, and yet they've won the german league twice and made it to the Champion's League final. Manchester United sold Cristiano Ronaldo, and they've been fine; same with Barca, Milan, Juve, and Inter, all of whom have sold Ibrahimovic, despite him being a top player.

As for Muslims abusing people going in for abortions, why would they? 95% of the worlds Muslims live in countries where the practice is totally banned.

So yes, he is culturally a Christian. No, he did not stand under a banner with verses from the bible written on it, shouting God is great! No he did not refer to the biblical verses which validated his behaviour. No he was not part of a network of funding and preaching that numbers well in excess of a million people.

Literally as soon as 2010 hits we see a steep increase of searches for food banks. Not much changed in 2010 to warrant a rise in food bank usage... Not much changed apart from our government, and with the government change came left wing newpapers using every trick in the book to make the Tories look bad. 

One tactic I believe was writing articles (and therefore advertising) food banks and how their usage is increasing. 

As the news coverage of food banks increased people who didn't even know they existed start using them, hence the increase in foodbank usage.

It is the reason why there is so much infrastructure setup in football to prevent exactly that - coaches, managers and owners have strict rules on what they can and can't say, players have strict rules on what they can and can't say, and players stating in public and on the record that they want to leave[1] is very, very rare because of the consequences. It is also in the FIFA registered agents conduct code that they are forbidden from encouraging players from speaking out on wanting to leave unless there are unusual circumstances. No self-respecting manager would be involved with a client who did so, since it would jeopardize their future work, especially with clubs.

This is all in place to protect the asset value of a squad, which can be destroyed with a simple few lines from any player.

The entire modus operandi of Real Madrid is to use Marca to drive down the transfer value of Suarez. They flatter him, he responds in kind, they force the issue and pick him up for cheaper. Tapping up - Fifa regulations, Article 18. 

[1] a player going on the record about wanting to leave is *extremely* rare. for eg. some in this thread mistook Alonso and Torres as having made on-the-record statements when they didn't. while it is true that the media discussed the rumors at the time, doing what Suarez did in Uruguay is a very unusual case and very rare. it simply isn't kosher in football to do what he did.

add that this is 'common knowledge' to the point that it is referenced in articles without explaining it or backing it up, for eg.:

 * [Rooney wants to leave United](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/05/09/wayne-rooney-leave-united_n_3242597.html): 

&gt; United rejected Rooney's request a fortnight ago and said he was not sale, however had they allowed Rooney to leave it would have driven his value down in the transfer market.

* [RVP can leave Arsenal, but not like this](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2169179/Robin-van-Persie-right-leave-Arsenal-like-this.html): 

&gt; At 4.02pm on July 4, Van Persie’s value in football’s over-inflated transfer market was worth around £25million to Arsenal. At 4.03pm when he delivered his slap in the face, sorry, update, to the fans, that had decreased by more than fifth.

NB You don't have to let him bring people in to view the flat when you're not there, nor do you have to show them around.  As a landlord he has no right to show people round your property unless it’s specifically stated in the tenancy agreement. Even then, tenants are entitled to 24 hours written notice.

If he's as much of a cunt as he sounds like he is then be one back.  You are entitled to ""quiet enjoyment"" of your home.  It states in every tenancy that the tenant is entitled to quiet and private enjoyment of the property and this includes the times that the landlord wants to show prospective buyers round. If it's not convenient say so and they don't have to be let in. Also say you would like advance warning so that you don't have people knocking on your door unexpectedly.

Point out every damp patch, crack in the plaster etc etc. Get your neighbours to have rap music blaring out and place the odd mouse trap down where they can see it. Get your mates to park their car outside, remove the wheels and prop it up on bricks and look like they're tinkering with it.

Skye is awesome, Applecross is good (not so much for the biking but the Apple cross Pass is a real ride into the clouds and you see deer and all sorts), Oban to Malegh (sp?) worth doing.  Anything further north we found a bit ropey.  John O'Groats isn't worth the fuel, Thurso is where all the chavved Corsas are.

But Skye, go to Skye.

Invergarry and Glencoe are good for biking and you have to do a lap of Loch Ness of course.

The road round Loch Leven is known as the Scotburgring.  Quite a ride.

true,Lollypopsoldier,num26,,"At 31 with his last 2 seasons being injury plagued with sporadic playing time I think his best years are behind him. However whilst his days as a Barca star are pretty much up, he could have a lot to offer us. He probably has 2-3 years of playing really good football left, assuming he can stay injury free. With a full pre season allowing him to reach full fitness and playing in his preferred central role he could well hit 20 league goals next year, and ease the goal pressure on Bale (assuming he stays). 


He does have little to no sell on value though if we do sign him, unless some crazy middle east team decides they want him in 3 years. So if he signs for us, he'll likely end his career with us. His link up play and passing is very good, as you'd imagine of someone from Barca, his off the ball movement is also good and when in form his finishing is second to none.


I think for the right price, around £8M, he could be a good signing. However I'm really hoping we have an entire new strike force next season and he is one of 2 new forwards on our roster. Maybe not the long term solution to our problem, but a good solution for the short term at the right price.

It isn't designed to get people into work / help people find a new job - you only have to talk to an unemployed person who has used it for more than five minutes, to realise it's lacking fundamental options. Or ask a anyone who has the mis-fortune of working in a JCP, most of whom have yet to receive even the most basic of training on how to use the system.

It's a tool for the DWP, to be used as required. Got a claimant sitting in front of you who you think would ""benefit"" from developing a regular routine? Make them log into UJ each day, ideally at a specific time, and make them post a little note in the Activity box.

The reason the PCS are so vocal against it is two-fold. Firstly it isn't fit for purpose. Monster (the people who developed it) have spent a small fortune developing a system that's inferior on almost every count, to commercial offerings.

The more worrying reason, however, goes back to my point about old Bentham. UJ is the first in a process that will, within 15 years, result in a significant number of JCPs closing, and those that remain, being run by minimal frontline staff. Most claimants will be expected to manage every aspect of their claim - from initially setting it up, to job searching, to managing their finances, via online services.

Here's how it'll work - some of these elements are already either widely available, or being piloted at the moment:

* Sign-up for JSA online, uploading relevant paperwork. UJ login details generated at this point.
* Schedule appointment with advisor - likely to still be via a physical location, but give it time, it'll be done online as well.
* Use UJ daily, to search for vacancies. CVs will be required to be structured in a certain way, so as to allow the system to automatically match you to vacancies it deems appropriate.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding but I don't think you can group all of these guys together and especially not with a player like Bernard. Siggy and Dempsy can play similar roles but it seems like AVB's preference is to use Siggy wide and Dempsy as a reserve striker. From what I've seen he appears to be much more similar to Lennon: pacy with the ability to get to the byline and clip in a cross, albeit with a much better goalscoring record.

since Wales won't make WC/Euro, the UCL is basically Bale's only option for high-profile international play. he's mentioned that he really wants it before (like every player). but if he stays on for next season, spurs will probably attract their few missing pieces this summer. from his perspective, the last seasons aside, im sure he thinks Spurs (with him) won't go another 3 years without a UCL appearance.

so if you're Bale, do you really want to play Juve and Malaga and Dortmund right now so badly you'd uproot your family to another country to fight for a starter's spot?

In that sense, it is quite possible for spending on services to be cut, while net outflows to rise, while still having the news media reporting on cuts here there and everywhere in spending.

After all, during the 1980s/90s, spending on the NHS grew faster than inflation in real terms, and yet all people seem to recall is that it was subjected to persistent cuts and closures.

Ullapool and poolewe cropped up too, so will definitely include those into the trip. (Mainly for the great isolation and ever changing landscapes).

true,trasofsunnyvale,lfc12,,"Yep, you're actually 100% right about Barca.  Tapping up signings and thus getting them cheaper is their game. I overlooked the other good examples you made and just focused on Mascherano, who I think was valued correctly. 

Aside from them, it doesn't happen too often, though, which was my main point.  I'd also argue that tapping up is only an option for a handful of the top clubs, as well.  Also Fabregas moved to Barca in 2011, which was the end of his contract (though built into that contract was the option to extend for 3 more years), Song had 2 years left, and Masch had 2 years on his contract.  And while 2 years is certainly not the end of a contract, it is different than Suarez, who has 4 left.  

Further, Tottenham were never going to keep hold of Modric, and I certainly don't think £33 million was less than Modric was worth (I don't think he was worth that). Song for £15 million also seems fair, as does Mascherano's fee.  Fabregas, at £29-ish million is the real steal.

Anyhow, I guess we hope that if he wants to leave we set a value and someone meets it.  I don't think Luis, based on his statements, or the club will have a problem if no one pays the right price for him, as they'd both be fine with him staying for another year.

true,nikcub,lfc68,null,"It is a meta-stat because accounting overall results can mix cause and effect, there are many other elements that go into a win/loss ratio besides a single player. Our start of the season was shocking, and it took time to develop and tweak the tactics until it started to work later in the season.

As with the Suarez stat, you can cut them in almost any way you like. I think Rodgers developing the team over the course of the season had a lot more impact on the win/loss ratio than the inclusion of Henderson in the starting lineup.

&gt; Cherry picking

I took the last ten games, also took the last season. The overall whoscored ranking, which puts him near-bottom in the Premier League overall, and second-bottom for his position, also takes the entire season. The overall stats and his ranking near the bottom also take the entire season.

&gt; Played a minority of games as a CM

17 of 23 starts were in CM, DM or ACM - eg. centrally.

&gt; Over-emphasis on pass completion rates, particularly considering (2)

Impossible to over-emphasis pass completion for somebody who wants to be a CM especially when you consider every incomplete pass means a turnover, a change of possession and the opposition being two centerbacks away from goal. One of biggest tactical and technical shifts in football in the past couple of years has been pressing from the front against central midfielders like Henderson and dispossessing them. That is why attackers have now had to defend more and learn to press (Oscar, Ribery, etc) while central midfielders are now having to be cut from a different mould - adapted players like Pirlo, Alonso and Gerrard rather than traditional box-to-box midfielders like Henderson who can no longer enjoy time on the ball like they used to. Henderson completely fails this adaptation. There is no position or role where pass completion is not more important (besides, pedantically, goalkeeper in short passes). That role needs 100+ passes a game and losing the ball a handful of times. anything in the 80% range is a complete shocker and not even worth considering, let alone for a club with top4 aspirations (let alone European aspirations - look at Schweinsteiger and Martinez and what they do with retention and distribution, Henderson isn't 1% of either nor does he share even an inch of either qualities). Henderson had entire strings of games where he was 74-76% on pass completion. You just can't emphasis how bad this is - and it was often against lesser competition. Forget 96, 94, 93% and only having to scurry back and cover 2, 3 or 4 times - we are talking about losing the ball on average every *3 minutes*.

&gt; Ignoring

I didn't ignore anything. I am taking him as a whole and over the entire season. I even fudged my stats to include his better games, for benefit of doubt. He had one excellent game against Newcastle, one OK game against QPR, and the rest was fluff. Even with the good games he is ranked near-bottom on almost every metric at Opta.

You give examples of in-excusable actions, but there were also good parts to it.

Tanganyika was a German colony (pre WWI). It was ruled pretty hard by the Germans, they killed all the chiefs they could find so there were no leaders for people to unite under. When it was granted to the British via the League of Nations it was quickly changed in structure to 'Indirect Rule'. This involved the tribal chiefs ruling their people. The chiefs would run their courts, collect tax and impose tribal law. As far as I can tell this was also the policy for Uganda, Kenya and other East African colonies.

Big problems occurred when independence was granted and democracy was put in place. You now had tribes being ruled by other tribes. Que massacres.

I'm not saying everything was rosy under the British, but due to the general embarrassment that was the irony of WWII, we have almost censored any praise that was due for the hard working people of the colonial service.

Now to defensive midfielder?
Gundogan would be nice, although stealing him from Klopp would make me sad, (I want him to have another chance at taking on Bayern) he would be ideal.


Frankly we could go to Germany (well Dortmund) for every position we need.

A fast Ball playing defender. (We have the stopper kind that Mou loves, Terry, Cahill, and potentially Ivan now we need the fast guy) Hummels? 

As already said Gundogan is a good fit for DM and although Rossi would be ideal I don't really think he will leave Roma. I really want us to chase De Rossi as it would be nice to have another experienced leader in the team with more of a driving voice than Luiz. (Luiz drives you forward with inspirational actions).

And as a strong centre forward to work with Lukaku, Ba and Torres, Lewandowski would be good. I feel a deal could be brokered if the Bayern one isn't sorted yet if we loaned them Lukaku for a season. Although it looks like KDB is going to Leverkusen, if he had got the move he wanted to Dortmund the understanding they could have gained with each other would have been great when it is time to shuffle Torres on. (Let's not forget he will be 30 next season, and will he be happy to be 2nd or 3rd after someone else and Lukaku? Heck for 200k I would but then how can we look to keep a back up player (not even rotation) on 200k.

If we were to sell him and replace him with a quality DM, like Gonalons or Wanyama, and buy an AM/winger hybrid then I wouldn't have a problem with this. Those 2 signings would make Henderson expendable. In a year or 2 we could then buy a box to box CM to take over for Gerrard, which is what Henderson or Allen would have done. 

If the sale of Henderson, transfer fee plus wages off the books, would allow us to add 2 quality players that do their respective roles better than Henderson does both, then I would have no problem with it. Moves like this, whether they happen or not, could be the difference between us getting top 4 this year or not.

McCourt and McGinn were sent bullets by Rangers fans/UDA men angry with Lennon at an Old Firm game. I doubt the perpetrators set foot in Windsor for internationals.

Lennon never got any abuse bar a small sub section of the Kop booing him for one game (v Norway) back when he made the move to Celtic. I remember the red white and blue Lurgan Rangers flag covering empty seats in the Kop the night he got a 'death threat' phoned in from a public telephone box in some estate in Lurgan. 

The police have to treat all threats as credible, even if it was a 16 year old armed with a 20p coin. I thought Sammy McIlroy, the manager at the time, would have backed Lennon to play but the truth is Sammy Mac was/is a managerial lightweight and wouldn't have the balls to do it.

Your combination of CM, DM and AMC into one is the major problem here. Henderson as an AMC or his ""1.5"" LM position, is not in the team to retain and recycle ball. His role, for example at arsenal and newcastle is similar to that described in this Michael Cox article http://m.espn.go.com/general/blogs/blogpost?blogname=tacticsandanalysis&amp;id=743

So focusing excessively on pass completion here is not that helpful. I agree with your part about the roles of CMs and attackers, but more often than not henderson is one of the attackers pressurising CMs and fullbacks; and he is the best player in our team at doing so.

Henderson's wages also have a bad effect on the rest of the squad. What do you tell Sturridge when he asks for 80k rather than 60k next season, or Coutinho? 

It is a combination of replacement potential, cost and not seeing Henderson as a starting 11 top 4 player in the Premier League that leads me to conclude that he should be sold (i'm not simply just going on about him being crap, its a lot more than that - he isn't producing up to his value/cost).

I do tend to think (from experience) that students have a fairly sheltered view of the city they live in (this is from my experience with Nottingham Hackspace). There is a lot of good things about the city. In the last few years the focus on crime and fear of crime has been greatly reduced with a lot more bobbies on the beat (well people in uniform at least) also there is over £500 million in investment in the transit system. If you  like a city with a proper integrated transit system then Nottingham will have an excellent one. The is the creative quarter initiative which I think will be excellent for the city as well. 

I do think the city itself is well run, clean and well organised, I hate to say it but it's a good council for the most part.

But the thing is with Torres, Ba, and Lukaku, that's three world class strikers already on the roster. Adding a fourth would just disrupt playing time for one if not two of those players. I think the cash would be much better spent on either A) shoring up the midfield with cdm (although I don't think we need another Mikel-esqe player. someone like Gundogan or Modric would be ideal. We need someone who works well transitioning defense to offense) or B) a really solid center back that way Luiz could be moved up to CDM (where he has played very well in my mind) without leaving the team shorthanded on defense.

I also love the pubs, the castle, the Arboretum in summertime, Clifton skatepark, and the way that the city doesn't look clean after rain like other cities do, the rain merely washes away one layer of grime to expose another. I love the sweatbox, toilet circuit venues that have let my band put on shows, and I love that all of the bus drivers on the 100 to Southwell are bloody lovely.

That just about gives you what I've experienced of Nottingham, and I'll miss it dearly. What makes me most afraid to live and work in Nottingham is that living in the suburbs will taint my love of the city itself. Nottingham gets a bad rep since the whole Shottingham thing, but it's truly great.

What I'm trying to say really is, don't take what I said all that seriously!

I got those jobs by going out and looking for them, going door to door if necessary. I once got offered a job selling antiques on a market stall from a guy I spilt a pint on in a pub.

And to people saying they want him to be honest about whether it's wanting to play in the CL rather than the media that makes him consider leaving, do you think Arsenal fans were ever so grateful that RVP told them their club wasn't good enough for him? Obviously that was worse since he left for a direct rival and I don't think Suarez would do that, but I'd rather him maintain his respect for us as supporters and for the club than pull a Torres or RVP.

true,free2bejc,1986,Gianfranco Zola,"I apologise for the length of the following reply, but please read it and give me your opinion. I believe it basically covers, all areas where Chelsea fans should really be wanting us to sign players and why.

If I've just specified a specific type of role that maybe we don't use that much I'm also implying that we should be able to play more than one tactic. I mean, 4-1-2-2-1, 4-2-3-1 and 4-2-2-2 for tactical exploitation of the opposition and variation that will worry other teams and their preparation. Much like Bayern can play counter, possession. 

I have previously said other times the Striker dilema has been brought up that we should just make Lukaku first choice of the strikers available to us.

But my point here was incoherent really as I didn't want to say it. I think I'd likely get flamed because that is how this Sub is but Torres is not good enough to be a rotation option. Ba maybe, and with his wage, more able to be a back-up. Lukaku and Lew for first team rotation would be perfect and allow us to really challenge in all competitions at the same time. Also, Torres appears (IMO) to be a stroppy striker and throw a bit of fit if a younger guy is getting much more games than him. Before he couldn't really argue with the Drog, and this season, we refused to challenge him.

I largely agree with your other points. Now to the topic of building a perfect squad to challenge the likes of a Bayern squad (especially bearing in mind how well they are strengthening their team despite dominating everything this season! I guess they understand how many fronts they will have to compete on). 

To be honest I see no real reason why we shouldn't build the ideal squad (and I mean players actually available to us) but I acknowledge that this is actually different to the changes/transfers season to season.

So weak points, despite this Sub's love of Mikel he is really a makeshift Anchor, he is capable but not great. And I mean 'great', not as in 'not great' pejoratively. When we bought him he actually played as an AM. We took him out of Man U's hands and they signed Anderson to do the exacts same thing the next season. Both players should move on from their respective clubs IMO.

Next part of the midfield reshuffle depends on Ramires ability and flexibility. He is like a Brazilian Milner. Hence, a bloody useful player to have a round, but not quite the best at any particular thing. Although that can be a vast asset in a sense. If we had another versatile player who was particularly strong in a specific position then he might well leave. Think Martínez for Bayern, he can play CB, DM/CM, possibly RM/RB to the same efficiency as Essien with some practice. Okay so we have Essien but we need a plan for when he gets too old. 

Personally, I think it would be better to play Romeu more to get him used to the pace of the Prem, he reads the game better than Mikel, looks like less of a headless chicken when defending and has better vision and better ball control but lacks an understanding with much of our team. We should give him time, at least as much as we have given Mikel so far ahahah. I'm not quite sure how Aké fits in, if he is to be a BPL CB then he needs to hit the gym. Chalobah also needs to get a bit bigger but is a capable back-up/cup rotation player to give the other DM/defensive minded CMers a rest. Gundogan and Vidal would be amazing purchases for this area, as would De Rossi.

Ok so that could be 1 or 2 defensive midfielders depending on whether we move Luiz to CDM permanently. If we move him then we need another fast CB. I don't believe our CB or in fact our defence is as bad as you could be led to believe. Ideally Hummels would be good and Cahill as a long term replacement for Terry. If Ivanovic is our rotation RB then buying another stopper such as Subotic would also be ideal. Luke Shaw to blend in for Ashley Cole. Bertrand still warrants a place as a club grown player and can be effective as a defensive winger with better crossing than Ramires (another Ramires utility role). And with Wallace ready to come in at RB in a few years that Defence looks solid to me for both rotation, drilling and ability to deal with different tactics.

Then as far as wingers go, we have Hazard who can play wide and run with the ball, Shürrle should be able to. Moses to an extent.

Playmakers are Mata, Oscar, Hazard, and KDB from a deep position Lampard would be included. Oscar could be developed into this role. Rooney could be employed as a Lampard replacement if he can learn Lampard's timing. Modric is an excellent possibility for this role as you've mentioned. Although I would prefer to buy a different young player, perhaps the Vitesse player we are linked with that I forget the name of.

Goalkeeper. This is obvious, and we're sorted on this one. Courtois stays on loan for another season or 2. Then comes back and challenges Cech for a season or 2. All the while our youth players/ club grown players are back-ups. Blackman deserves a place, and is a free spot in the CL squad registration (4 for club grown players).

Right, I think that covers most aspects of our squad. The only thing left to cover with specific players is youth aspects. Currently we never complete our squad registration with the 4 club grown players that we should to give us a good sized squad for the CL. The other aspect to this, IMO, is that a club-grown player ought to be a Captain for the club. These players usually show an innate drive for their Club and only for their club. Such devotion is a prized commodity in the modern game. As much as Luiz can be touted for a future Captain I can't see him as the vocal motivator of Terry. I can see Luiz literally trying to bulldoze his way individually to the win but that is not necessarily the best way to lead, I'd rather see someone who just somehow gives more than you thought humanely possible around the pitch as a leader.

true,bonobo1,eng-westmidlands,Birmingham,"While I agree the article isn't very good, I do agree with it's premise, (and if it does blame town planners, it misunderstands what town planners are).  To stop Birmingham 'overheating' central government severely disincentivised new industrial and office development in the West Midlands during the 60s and 70s. This predictably lead to the consolidation and bloating of existing West Midlands industries, most notably the motor manufacturing sector.  The thousands of small businesses that made Birmingham great no longer existed by the time globalisation came around. Not surprisingly, the unwieldy and indiverse remains of industry, starved from innovation, stood little chance when exposed to international competition.

This was nothing to do with urban (town) planning, and everything to do with central government policies.  

Edit: Suburbanisation happened everywhere, and while it was as bad for Birmingham as it was for other British cities I doubt it had anywhere near the impact of industrial and commercial restrictions.
