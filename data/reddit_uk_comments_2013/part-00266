true,snowysnowy,1986,Gianfranco Zola,"&gt; GK-Next season let Hilario and Schwarzer go and recall Courtois. Allow Courtois the opportunity to prove himself and keep Cech for competition.

A little worried about this - 2 world class keepers generally have no business being in the same side, unless one is looking to end his career in the immediate future. Now there a chance that Cech might see that he can finally get a little more safety regarding his head and retire early, and in that case, Courtois would be happy to return and get consistant play time. The last time that happened, Cudicini quickly left the club, and only stayed longer because Cech had that horrible injury.

Jamal Blackman still plays for the youth side mainly, and I don't think he's ready to step up if the need arises, as second keeper (if Cech retires). 

Lastly, Courtois will demand playing time, because as a youngster, he will be looking to build his international career as well.

This is the happy problem that we have though, but we have to fight to maintain Courtois.

I do like your suggestions to start to incorporate the youth team and give them a chance to step up, but it's an extremely big risk that we're taking by doing so, the consequences being losing out on Europe qualification, silverware and maybe even our manager.

That's not my proposed solution; it's a jaded view of the current politics.

Here's an imaginative solution: have all candidates fill in an application form on which there is the question:  

**Are you a greedy money-grabbing bastard? (Y/N)**

Anyone who answers **Y** will be forced to abandon their political aspirations and return to banking.

- - -

The other thing you could do to attract the right sort of people is to make it easier to maintain a family life while working as an MP. Make the hours closer to normal office hours, end the culture of debates at 11pm and drinks at the bar afterwards.

Allow MPs to _debate_ remotely the same way we use video-conferencing and Skype in other walks of life, so that someone can be around their family and constituents in Scotland or Northern England and still participate.

If you make it easier for MPs to work in politics and be with their families during the down-time hours, you'd attract more women into politics, and people who are more in touch with their communities.",0,1386587810,null,0,1386588446,0,cdxc501,t3_1sf08m,t1_cdxc501,t1_cdxc2i5,null,1428328771,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

That and GCHQ was hardly a well kept secret; it would have stretched incredulity for anybody that was thinking about it to not think they were collaborating with the NSA, CIA and FBI.  The real whistleblowing was how the UK was able to retain snapshots of the entire Internet going through UK servers for days at a time - but sensationalism aside that means nothing until we know exactly how many warrants and court actions were passed to access it, and to what extent.  That's what the investigation is for.   If it turns out that the judiciary has kept a very tight watch over exactly what information is accessed or filed beyond the 3 day Tempora window then the Snowden case takes on a very different light.

So it's investigation first, possibly an inquiry, and if there's criminal proceedings then maybe some talk of immunity whilst giving evidence, but it would be an incredibly brave Snowden that sets foot inside the EU.  You don't need Snowden for an investigation, you need to go to Cheltenham and find what warrants have been issued and what intercept partners have been used.

Anyway travellers moved into the grassy area either side of the footpath, i can't really remember there being much trouble when they were there, but you could tell lots of rubbish was building up.

They had been doing scrape/waste removal for money, and rather than pay to depose of it at the dump they just left it where their camp site was. This included basically filling up the bush area with black bags full of rubbish, and dumping toxic waste like paint and oil all over the place.

In the end it took the council a week or two to sort it all out, they were using massive skips which must of been 8 feet tall and 20 feet long and they used several of these to clear the waste.

Not only that, they also had to basically cut down most of the bushes and trees to get to half of the rubbish, and they dig up the soil where they toxic waste had been.

I live in Gloucestershire and most cyclists I know personally are not in this adversarial 'ban HGVs! ban cars!' club. But then Gloucestershire is one of the better counties for cycling, whereas London seems to be pretty shit. 

I would blame Boris Johnson in part for this because they spend next to nothing on improving cycling in the capital - and crucially - the money that is spent is probably going into someone's back pocket. The cycle superhighways of London cost **£1,000,000 - £2,000,000 a mile**. And they're shit.

Having said that, even with the ludicrously offensive value for money, London has still only invested about £50m in cycling infrastructure. Perspective: upgrading a single road in Gloucestershire to bypass a roundabout will cost between £100m and £200m.

A lot of people get nervous by the idea of cycling down there, but the path is a lot wider than you'd think for cycling and people are generally very considerate of each other down there. Liberal use of the bell is the key for the blind corners!

That said, you'll of course have an occasional imbecile. You get a few people charging down there with headphones in - now, if you're going to ride down a narrow path with blind corners whilst deaf, you go *carefully*. A while back whilst approaching one of the bridges I slowed down and rang my bell a few times before heading under it. Halfway past, another cyclist comes tearing around the corner ahead of me.

I have never had the impression that Roman was the kind of guy who says no to his manager. Last summer, Jose wanted Rooney, but Rooney was not for sale, nothing much both manager and owner could have done here (except paying an insane amount of money).

With the exception of Falcao and Suarez, all the world class strikers are cup tied. Jose seems to like a specific kind of striker (one who is the first line of defence and tracks back- like Drogba, Eto'o or in a far lazier way Benzema - also probably the reason why he wanted Rooney). Those strikers are quite thought after by all the big clubs so if one is available (which is quite rare) it will be a blood bath to sign him - hence very likely expensive. The January transfer market is already quite expensive so it is unlikely we will see someone that good available.

Finally, having so many attack minded midfielders means that our strike force will score less. It is not specific to Chelsea - Villa and Sanchez (at Barcelona) Benzema and Higuain (well until last year) (at Real Madrid) all struggled.

* 1440 - 1515 Lesson

* 1520 - 1555 Lesson

* 2000 End of prep time

* 2100 Lights out.

On half days (Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday) There'd only be five lessons and games between 1400 and 1530ish. On Mondays there were no games at all, just free time.

It seems very tightly scheduled and it was. It also didn't leave much time for homesickness.

As I got older the routine was relaxed for older year groups [and eventually resembled this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/1sevwv/what_is_a_typical_boarding_school_day_in_england/cdxad8n).

&gt;For example, when the lessons are over, say at 15:00, can't I just go to my dorm and do whatever I want?

If you had no commitments then sure. Sport was mandatory though. To get a bit more free time I'd get up early when I was younger (Falling asleep around 2200 meant that getting up at 0600 was easy).

Mostly though people socialised and as we were together the whole time it didn't bother us too much. This was in 1998 - 2000 though and as such there weren't as many fun things to do (smartphones, games consoles, internet access, etc..).

&gt; Or can I stay up all night?

Not recommended but certainly feasible later. We had dorms for the first three years, after that we shared studies with a few others. Eventually most of us had individual rooms. I could stay up all night if I wanted to but it wasn't worth it and there wasn't that much to do anyway!

&gt;...and if I stay up all night I get a detention?

Detention? I think it existed at my school but it was uncommon. Staying up all night would probably be seen as punishment enough - given that there'd then be a full day ahead of the student!

I know one of my chemistry teachers had ""bench polishing club"". Students who had wronged him would be required to be at his lab relatively early to polish benches (I don't recall if it was 0700 or 0730 - early enough to be annoying). I was never required to attend so I'm not sure. He probably still does it (he's a quirky but endearing character - the kind that old students have a Facebook group for).

&gt;Is it really all that strict?

No. Strictness was rarely required. My experiences suggested that it was more of a community with its own social norms and attitudes. People didn't really act out because, for the most part, we weren't very unhappy. We had friends around us all day, engaging teachers, fun activities, and shared suffering (i.e. prep time, etc..).

&gt;Also can I leave school whenever I want after the lessons? 

To go where?

The school I went to was in a small town. There was a cinema, a few supermarkets, and some other shops. Initially we had one hour a week of ""up town time"" (it was actually up a hill!). By the end I think I was allowed to be in town most of the day, every day. I rarely took advantage of it though because, well, why?

That's like saying a country is 100% representative and democratic as long as the people agree they want what the one party state wants. 

It's just a natural interpolation: if the most popular party of a country is more easily ignored then the country has less say.  It's ipso facto.

It's much simpler than that to explain; they're divergent.  What the greater share of the British voters want is not reflected in Europe i.e. they have less say.  It's even worse for the Lib Dems.  As a coalition partner they daren't even repeat at a high level what their voting bloc  says on the continent. 

As far as contributions are concerned the UK's continues to go up in comparison as the rebate becomes less and less as ascension states join, due to the nature of how it is worked out.  More countries in, lower rebate.  Also, as the OBR points out, the increase is due to currency weakness of the eurozone so France's and Germany's increase is of no consequence; they're Eurozone countries.  The important thing is the likes of the UK and Sweden having to pay more for something they're not a part of or to blame for.  Don't forget these non-eurozone countries are paying more because the eurozone has repeatedly been in breach of not only Article 125 of its own treaty but also spending and borrowing under ERM2.

Only if you can trust the government to use their power appropriately, and only if there is someone above it all, identifying and stopping abuse when it happens.

Snowden's leaks have shown that they are not worthy of this trust. That's the whole reason he blew the whistle in the first place. He has shown that the government and intelligence agencies are using the cover of secrecy and security to perform illegal surveillance and have been getting away with it.

It's not ideal to have such sensitive information in the hands of more people. It would have been better if a government oversight committee was the one looking at the documents and performing the investigation. But the government has shown to us that it is incapable or unwilling to police itself.

Snowden stealing this information and releasing it to these newspapers is a last desperate attempt to reveal what has been covered up very successfully up until now. If you can no longer trust the government to do what is right, then you can try turning to the journalists to do it.

Furthermore, with regards to there actually being *any* super important secret identities in the leadks, all we have is the word of the governments who are most damaged and embarrassed by the leaks. It is impossible to show either way whether any agents are actually in serious danger without releasing the information that would put them in serious danger, but I'm not going to simply take the word of the side who are clearly putting all their efforts into character assassination. I'm not just going to believe a government spokesperson who says, ""millions of people could die because of Snowden's leaks!!"" without good reason to.

The method in which Snowden took and released parts of the information can be questionable, and some of it could be dangerous, but what it has revealed is extremely important to all of the public and *should* be known. The ends do not justify the means, so Snowden should not be getting off scot free. We also have to put a lot of trust into these three people and the journalists with access to the information. But at this moment, I wouldn't say I trust the government any more than I trust them. And I won't be convinced by malicious efforts to destroy the credibility of Snowden and the leaks to try and overshadow the revelations from the leaks.",0,1386597601,null,0,false,0,cdxdui7,t3_1se0li,t1_cdxdui7,t1_cdxd5rb,null,1428327902,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,KJS123,null,null,"I actually live in West Pilton, and think I can elaborate on this quite a bit. You are right on most parts. The group(s) are usually chavvy young adults, but I've often seen them no older than about 9 or 10. There are a couple of houses that are known for being glorified chopshops. You can usually tell by the number of discarded tyres around the back of the house. Often, the adults that run the whole thing will send their own kids out to hunt and steal pretty much anythink they can, strip them of all non-essential parts and licence plates and trash them. Burning, as you say, is VERY common. They dump the bike on the public park, y'know the one where kids play, throw a match in the fuel tank and run. They try this on bikes, but no vehicle is safe. Bicycles, motorbikes, someone around here even stole a porche a couple of months ago. Bastard goes to the very highschool my mum works at.

 If the kids DO get caught, which isn't common, then the parents maintain plausable deniability and get away with it. The kids get a slap on the wrist and all goes back to as it was. The cops WANT to stop it, but the truth is, they don't have the power. A combination of proper conduct and a legal system that protects the kids means that they can do NOTHING until the kid is 16, which most of them aren't. If you want to do your part, then BE CAREFUL. Most of them DO carry knives and WILL use them. NEVER start shit on your own, and if they target you, get somewhere public or indoors. Call the police and remember the details. If possible, dedicate yourself to one individual, learn name, face, and when the little cunts run away from the sirens, which directin they went. 9 out of 10 times, they ran home. 

I own a Motorbike myself, and living in West Pilton has made me VERY wary. The best advice I can give is keep your Car locked and alarmed, Bicycles; KEEP indoors. Nothing else will do. If your bicycle is outside, it WILL get fucked, and quickly! Motorbikes are the hardest to defend, being the most targeted. I live one floor up, so indoors is out of the question. All I cn recommend is: Keep it covered up, Get an alarmed disk-lock, keep it out of sight. Keep it chained to a solid anchor. That won't stop the most determined thief. But it WILL buy you a shit-load of time. The alarm will probably scare them off, if they've half a brain.

It pains me to say, there's little else you can do. If you live near someone who you know is stealing bikes, report them. Even if the police can't arrest them, they WILL take details and do follow-ups. I've spoken to the polica about this, just yesterdy, and they are as eager to deal with the problem as any good citizen would be. 

Stay safe, guys.

true,fourhams,scottish,Scotland,"You actually need to look up the definition of censorship. Being able to get the same content in copious supply in other ways is not censorship. It's not censorship because that's not what censorship means. 

The argument is that page 3 sends a negative message to people, especially young women, about the role of women and about body image. 

The argument about appropriateness is that sexual images are freely available on the internet and in adult magazines where they're actively sought out for that purpose and that's fine, but when they're in The Sun it's objectifying because they are so casually decorating news stories about men doing important things, they until recently mocked the women with the little 'Lucy, 22, thinks blah blah blah about the economic situation', and this is freely available for children to see on the shelves, people leave it lying around, people read it in public because it masquerades as a family newspaper. Women and men are presented in very different ways in the media - this is the most striking example. Women can't just get on with what they're doing without it becoming about what they look like, even if their job has nothing to do with looks. This is not to say there is not a place for celebrating sex and beauty and enjoying all of that - but it's just not all the fucking time, everywhere. 

It builds sexualised images of only one gender into our everyday lives to the point where it is an expectation. An example of this is that people like you are throwing fits about not being able to casually look at sexual images in a newspaper, out in the open, where kids can see it, instead of realising you can actually get them in copious demand in your own, private, adults-only time and wank to your heart's desire.

true,AAAristarchus,null,null,"Lukaku's record had a caveat. He has best GPM for players who has scored more than 20 goals. If you increase that number to 40, he doesn't have that record anymore, but then he's not in the running b/c he hasn't scored up to 40 goals. 
IMO, Lukaku is one of the best, If not the very best in the league when you put him side by side with a defender. That, however requires that he's played through into space. How frequently does that happen in Chelsea? Lukaku is not great with his back to goal or in front of the defenders. He's better now than last season, but he's still nowhere near Drogba's level in that department. The good news is that he recognizes his weakness and is working to fix it, the bad news is that his particular weakness is not one he'll be allowed to work on in our colors, because we can deal with finishing issues as we have with Torres since he arrives, but Lukaku's particular weakness costs possession in a very expensive fashion as we were reminded again with the Eto'o debacle yesterday.

The pickers/sorters used it to check that the supermarkets would accept the pear as being pear shaped and of various grades.  If a pear failed the shape test it was discarded, some went for pulping for juice and some for feed but a lot were just thrown away.

I don't understand how this lessens Britain's voice at all, as the representatives from the Conservative party still sit in the European Parliament. What a lot of Euroskeptics seem to forget is that we're one of many in the European Union; we have no right to have our opinions dominating the EP, only adding to them alongside the other European nations (which is how it currently is).

As for what the Eurozone nations are paying, I'd rather see hard statistics than speculation from a pro-Tory newspaper. While it's likely that the Eurozone contribution has gone down somewhat due to the fact that EU budgeting is based on GNI of member states, I doubt it's as big a change as you'd think.

[They even have their own UKIP LGBT group!!!](https://twitter.com/ukiplgbt)



&gt;against climate change

Actually they state that climate change is and has always been a fact.  If you had actually read their manifesto you'd see that they called for extra investment and research into coastal defences - which is ironic given that this week coastal defences have been failing.

&gt;""traditional family values""

The BNP want to put an apartheid wall up, UKIP want to promote a common civic identity irrelevant of ethnicity.   Those are some seriously different 'traditional family values'.

&gt;get out of European Court of Human Rights

That's tautology of getting out of Europe.  

&gt; they say too many people live in UK

UKIP is again for NET immigration only controlled.  50,000 a year net if you must know, and then they put it up to 75 000 with a statement that they would raise it again if needed.

&gt; they are against new developments (new places for building)

UKIP is actually pro-localist and empowering local authorities, advocate freeing up legislation on brown field land to open up new builds.

&gt;There is also article

Great.  A CiF attack article with no editorial standard.

A lot of misinformation being flown about in here and i hope to help straighten this out. I have worked in short term lending for the better part of 11 years now and i'm happy to have a nice civilized discussion about how the legal side of it all works in the UK if your interested.

So starting at the picture, It looks terrible but in actuality if you are on JSA you will not get a loan. Fact. A number of reasons fit into this so i'll list them quickly. 

**The Law:**
A Few laws changed 2010 (if i remember correct) and they had a lot of sweeping changes to who could get a loan. The main one introduced the rules behind ""responsible lending"". Experian do a really nice run down on it [here](http://www.experian.co.uk/blogs/latest-thinking/2013/05/what-is-responsible-lending/). 

Other rules came in and a new organisation was formed called the FSA to police the lending industry with hefty fines if they broke the rules of conduct. Also many (not all) are part of organisations like the [BCCA](http://www.bcca.co.uk/) who also set down a code of conduct for its members in exchange for having a unified defense against the stigma attached to the industry.



The TL:DR of the legal side here is if you don't have an income, no loans for you unless you lie (this is important we will come back to this after). If you have difficulty paying every company has to have a ""financial hardship"" policy which freezes all interest if you can't pay and chunks it down over a longer period of time. 


**The Lender:**
If you lend out £100 to someone you want it back. Simple fact here and companies no matter how big want the same. Problem is if you have no income why would they lend you it? Even if we do, we have to contend with fraudsters and idiot liars daily that eats into our profit. With all that in mind people still think companies just blind fire free money out to people, despite how insane an idea that is.



Now down to the meat of this, Why the industry exists.


Its a service to people who need a bit of cash ahead of payday. If used responsibly (company's are not alone in sharing responsibility here, customers need to not borrow over their means) it should be paid off within a a month. At max it should be done within 3 and if not 90% of company's will automatically assume this is hardship and try to help.


This is turning into a monster post so lets round this off. 
If you are currently in debt with a payday lender and legitimately can cannot pay it then ask about the company hardship policy. They will ask for bank statements to prove your financial situation and help you to get the debt out of the way. The last thing they want is nothing back and will go above and beyond to try to help you clear it if you ask.

**TLDR:** Payday loan company's might not be the nicest idea in the world but do not assume they are some big devil who will lend to people on JSA. If they do They have to deal with bad debt, hefty fines and no way of making money here. Also, no kneecaps are broken at any point so can we stop the loan shark comparison now?

EDIT: I'm happy to talk anything out here but this is a topic that just invokes rage so lets try and keep it civil please.

I was in dorms of up to 30 boys - if you intended to stay up all night then you'd piss off 29 others so it was unlikely, plus any misbehaviour in a dorm would usually result in punishment for the whole dorm.  I remember once having to scrub the walls because someone had opened up a glowstick and thrown it around the room.  The housemaster refused to turn off the lights until it was all cleaned up, but you couldn't see it with the lights on.

The older you are, the more freedom you're allowed.  In the final year of school (age 15 / 16) we were in single or twin rooms, and were allowed to do prep (homework) in our own rooms, whilst the rest of the boarding house were in one large, supervised room.  You still had to remain silent though.

On weekends you were allowed off campus, but otherwise you had to remain within the school grounds (prefects were allowed to visit the newsagents that was &gt;100m away).  The older you were, the further you could go on weekends.  Younger years were allowed to the local village, older could get the bus to the nearest town and the oldest years were even allowed to get the train into London, as long as you were all back by a set time, and you informed the house parents of where you were going.

My house parents were really kind, and often made a strong effort to ensure our free time was entertaining.  The house had a table tennis table and a pool table, three old computers and I remember them subscribing to ON Digital when it first came out (1998?).  If there was something specific we wanted to watch we would have to book it way in advance.  I remember block booking friday nights to watch whatever WWF show was on at the time.  Friday nights we were allowed to stay up later than usual as our scheduled activities on Saturday started an hour later.  The house master had some connections at the FA and would occasionally get us free tickets to England games at Wembley - he'd also arrange transport for us to get there and back.

If you ever wanted to use the school pool in the evening free time he'd always be keen to supervise, as long as you had at least five swimmers and there were enough staff around to cover for him.

That Saturday lie in was great, but also the reason I have a big scar on my head.

During my time at boarding school I was never really keen on it.  My first school was a long way from home and my initial home sickness made me think I hated being there.

Because the European Parliament is run on a quid pro quo basis between voting blocs.

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"Personal accountability is not what this is about. Of course people are expected to be held to account, but the account of someone barely scraping by should not be the account of a middle class person that owns three houses and has a nice job.

Although, now you bring it up, obesity has been shown to be an indication of mental illness or past trauma; a lot of the time these people are not making the best decisions for themselves and probably need help, in the same way that children do.

Children is an interesting concept here, because the people that own these loan companies; they are of a class that isn't. by and large, self made. They were given a huge level of inheritance in the form of money, social networks and support well past the age of 18. They weren't cut off, given £70 a week and told that the reason they're not better off is because they were lazy and didn't work hard enough.

The people that own these loan sharks probably never have to work a day in their lives. And, if by some fucking miracle, they are self made millionaires, they're in a shrinkingly small number of such people - so small its hard to believe that they got there through hard work, but rather, finding the right con or ripping off enough people.

Furthermore, studies have shown that poor people are rarely in the state of mind to make the fantastic decisions, like buying a million bitcoins when they cost fuck all, or starting a  business (which you can't do if you want to keep receiving your JSA). If you're poor, the longer you're poor the more you realise it isn't going to end, so why bother playing the game of rich people? 

Planning out a life or a future is a luxury for people with money and power over there lives, if you're poor you have no power but you still wish you could have a nice Christmas - just like the ones you had when you were a kid. The ones you see on big billboards, in fancy John Lewis adverts, that your richer friends have. Oh look, a loan... I know I shouldn't... who the fuck cares, I'll be poor forever anyway, or I can always get a shitty temp job in the new year.

People like to say 'personal accountability' because it feeds a well crafted narcissistic world view, that you're richer because you're smarter, work harder, or some other nonsense; the reality is that you're born into a class and you'll probably die in that class; personal accountability doesn't change a damn thing.",0,1386602727,null,0,false,0,cdxfbpk,t3_1sge87,t1_cdxfbpk,t1_cdxdvvt,null,1428327212,65,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,65

Man City and Chelsea- Not a fan of how they spend their money but I kind of like how many top players they bring in, it's arguably good for the EPL having teams with similar spending power to Real Madrid (as long as we can compete) and they also play more attractive football than the likes of Utd.

With his former selves, he devises a solution that avoids a paradox by appearing to the outside observer to be the same as before: there's a big bang, Gallifrey is gone, and the Daleks burn.

It's a storytelling convention in Doctor Who, particularly in the Moffat era, that when multiple Doctors meet, the younger ones lose the memory of the shared events until they reach the age of the oldest Doctor present. This makes precious little sense scientifically (disclaimer: I am not a scientist), but the convention exists to maintain the dramatic narrative, in-universe.

Otherwise, for instance, the Tenth Doctor wouldn't have had an emotional reunion with the Master (who he thought to be dead) in *Utopia/Sound of Drums*, because he would remember learning-- from himself-- of the Master's continued existence when he was the Fifth Doctor in *Time Crash*.

But, because *Time Crash* didn't happen for the Tenth Doctor (the oldest Doctor present) until AFTER *Utopia*, he still had not regained his memory of being told, as the Fifth Doctor.

*UKIP believes that the small changes we have seen in global temperatures in the last century (+0.7oC) are entirely consistent with well-understood, long-term, natural climate cycles.* They want to use coal, gas and nuclear power. - no, that is not a statement against climate changes caused by humans?

*EU citizens who have been established in the UK for seven years or more will, depending on their circumstances, be able to apply for permanent leave to remain (provided they fulfil certain criteria and are eligible to apply for work permits).* - doesn't this statement implicate they want to throw out some people only because they haven't been in UK for enough time although they came in legally.

Immigration from outside of EU was and is controlled (whether properly enough that's another thing). Shame there is no mentioning that controlling EU migration would work both ways (Visas to travel within EU for Brits!).

Free speech: (Ukip) *Political correctness is stifling free speech*, BNP *Abolish all restrictions on traditional free speech; common law provisions against incitement to violence are the only proper limits in a free society*

As I understand it, Moffat's position was that it's pointless to argue over what the ""canon"" numbering is because there is no canon numbering. The Doctor has never called himself by a number. He's always just ""The Doctor"". The numbering is just something we as fans of the show use to keep the different regenerations straight. All that re-numbering does is make it harder for us to know who we are referring to when we say ""11"". So just stick with the old numbers, and use 8.5, or the War Doctor, or Hurt's Doctor. We'll all know what we really mean, and we'll all know that Eccleston is technically then 10th.

Plus, if you want to get picky, Smith would technically be the 13, not 11. The meta-crisis definitely did count toward the regeneration count, according to Moffat.

I read that as, 'Please do not respond to anything I say after this as I don't want my views to be challenged.'

However to appropriate your own debating technique of avoiding the issue: 'First, I did not say that', what I said was that it was more fiscally responsible than the previous Conservative government.

&gt;First, I did not say that NHS spending was bloated. I said that Labour nearly doubled spending on the NHS without significant improvement in the service.

I said that you were 'alluding' to it. Regardless, to me is seems that you would rather debate semantics rather than the facts. Particularly since these facts don't fit your own agenda. 

&gt;I will concede that Labour inherited a deficit of 29.2 billion from the Conservatives, I was previously speaking from obviously flawed memory. I will point out to you however, that this Government inherited a deficit of over 156 billion. Hardly cause for celebration.

Prior to the 2008 financial collapse the deficit was £36.4bn or 2.5% of GDP whilst in 1996 the deficit was 3.7% of GDP. 

&gt;I think it also reasonable to point out to you that the ridiculously disadvantageous PFI deals enacted under Labour also disguise a large amount of debt, and the ongoing financial commitments to those PFI deals will make it extremely difficult to cut spending without biting heavily into services.

The black population is less than 2% of the UK. The US has 15% black, and another 15% hispanic. So it's much more likely that stereotypes etc will exist when the minority is a much larger minority. Plus, the two guys from the UK were both London-centric and although politicians might forget it sometimes, London does not equal the UK. 

Combine that with what the top comments said about the history of race in the two countries (UK blacks coming from the commonwealth with their own culture vs US blacks brought as slaves and stripped of theirs) and it makes a lot more sense.

In places such as the Mediterranean, India, Africa &amp; the hot regions of the Americas, they weren't always able to get hold of good quality meat and veg (and if they did, it wouldn't keep for too long unlike in chilly Britain) and therefore had to find a way to cover the not particularly nice natural taste of the ingredients, which therefore explains the heavy use of spices and herbs in the places I listed above.

Sure there is.  Even the federalists in the Spinelli group advocate Associate Agreement status for anybody enacting article 50 and even countries like Turkey are negotiating visa free travel.

Tis not a problem.

&gt;Political correctness is stifling free speech

Right, and?   

You're surely not going to be using advocacy of free speech to argue how a party is like the BNP, are you???

&gt;I won't be bothered looking for exact statements any more as if people can't see similarities then they are blind

I suppose this, really, is the crux of the issue.

If you were (partly) responsible in determining the guilt of the accused, and you were to happen upon a piece of information that was either new, or not disclosed during the proceedings for whatever reason, you shouldn't be able to use that information, whether it is true or false.

It's up to the police and the prosecution to analyse any evidence, present it accordingly, and have the Jurors make an unbiased decision based on what is presented in court, not on potential hear-say online.

No, it's not.

&gt;So, poor people don't count?

That's not what I said at all.

&gt;If you'll look again, you'll see I said average wage of the bottom 1%, that is those that are actually working.

You didn't stipulate that you were discounting the unemployed, and your original statement would read that you were including them.

&gt;Plus, I'm not sure MPs are the best and brightest in our society. 

I never said they were, I said that one would hope they would be. Of course they're not going to be, but one would hope we attempt to foster conditions which brings about this outcome to the fullest.

&gt;Anyways I have no idea how much the bottom 1% earn, but MPs' salaries would be 5x (for example) that.

According to wikipedia the bottom 1% have an average pre-tax income of £8430 per year.

The 2012/2013 salary for MP's is £66,396, which is 7.87 times the income of the poorest 1% of society.

&gt;So when the bottom 1% earn more so would MPs.

You would probably be increasing MP's wages if you did that, frankly. I highlighted the poorest 1% of society, but obviously most of if not all of the bottom 1% will be unemployed. If you're going to take the bottom 1% of earners and multiplying their pre-tax income by 5 then you'll probably end up increasing MP salary.

Anyway, now that I've rebutted your extremely arsey post with an equally arsey post, I'm happy to say that I do see your point, but I just don't think it's a good idea to put artificial limits on salaries - I don't see what good it does to create these limitations when you can just have an independent body deciding these things, as we have now.",0,1386609434,null,0,false,0,cdxhy7i,t3_1sgh2h,t1_cdxhy7i,t1_cdxhqc5,null,1428325988,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

true,guernican,null,null,"Well, I think you're working from some misconceptions here. Will try to address as many as I can.

&gt; Throughout history Britain has been a poor country. 

If, by this, you mean that the majority of people in the country subsist and have little money to spend on luxuries, this is true of nearly every country in the world and is still true today. And, true though it is, I'm not really sure how it contributes to your point. 

&gt; we've suddenly got an empire spanning the entire world, and a massive amount range of food suddenly opens up to us. 

That is, of course, precisely why we have such a diverse food culture here now. Our immigration, until fairly recently, has been dominated by former colonial possessions: India and the West Indies, for example. Chinese food is harder to quantify: obviously the British had interests in China, both on the mainland and in Hong Kong - hence, among other things, the Opium Wars - but the explosion in Chinese restaurants didn't seem to happen til post-WW2. 

&gt; And besides, almost every food is copied from elsewhere anyway. 

Again, there's truth here but not quite, I don't think, in the way you mean it. Yes, maritime nations like the Portuguese exported foods like the chili, and centuries before them the Phoenicians traded spices and suchlike from the Far East. Certainly they came to Britain to buy tin. The point is that this cross-fertilisation of goods, including foods, has happened for thousands of years. Cultures so-opt these things. I wouldn't call this ""copying"" so much as adaptation. 

As to what is intrinsically British food... certainly if you look back two hundred years or so, cultural influences on cooking tended to reflect the tenor of the times. In much the same way that the British bought little French wine, so the British avoided what they termed ""made dishes"". That anti-French sentiment - or, as they would probably have termed it had they even thought about it, a commitment to British individuality - has defined much of our culture, and vice versa, and we still see its legacy in a casual way. 

Other people have made the point about ingredients and the quality of them. Certainly we're fortunate in that sense: we lack the sun-driven abundance of southern Italy, but that colder climate has tended to inspire many of the things we think of as intrinsically British. If you think of shepherd's pie, for example, that's just carbs and protein: working man's food, designed to fuel manual labour. The colder the climate, the more calories you burn, which is why you think so much of delicacy of cooking here. Which isn't to say it doesn't exist, but it's not what I'd call characteristic. 

Many chefs out there using classic technique or modern tech with British ingredients. Ramsey is an obvious one but Tom Aikens, Marcus Wareing (who, I think, opened a ""Traditional"" British restaurant in Kings Cross) and plenty of others have added a British twist to the classic French cooking style that seems to be the prerequisite for getting recognition in the dining world.

The rational evidence is that if the minimum wage is higher than the economic value of employing someone: sadly the case given how many young people are leaving school without employment, skills or education, a company will only be able to take them on for free, or not at all. 

Say if the minimum wage is £6 an hour and a totally unskilled worker is worth £4 an hour, a company that might have taken them on for £3 an hour will be unable to, and thus unemployment increases.

Empirically, one must remember that our minimum wage was brought in at a time of massive economic growth, so a slash in employment would be very unlikely to come to fruition. However, the growth in private sector employment was extremely negligible and the previous decade will be remembered for creating the highest long term youth unemployment ever. The government effectively making it illegal to higher young people with no skills is the primary cause of this, as the Labour Government were investing more than ever in giving young people the skills they need. 

Of course as it's a subjective discipline, it's hard to prove a definite, scientific causality, but most economists agree that implementing and increasing a minimum wage increases unemployment.",0,1386610534,null,0,false,0,cdxif95,t3_1sd5ea,t1_cdxif95,t1_cdxb7m2,null,1428325767,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I am sure it's demanding, but it's not 'hard' in the sense that most people would subscribe to. No one is expecting of the royal family more than they can take, and their role will either be scaled back or aided if it were.

In the olden days they used to fire Monarchy. There was a big ceremony and everything. 

These days they don't. They have COMPLETE job security. Forever.

They may well work a lot, but each part of their job is entirely voluntary. If the queen decided she was fed up she can just retire into a life of wealth. 

&gt;All under intense media scrutiny. I sure as hell wouldn't swap places with them.

There are easier ways to live. But I think 99% of the world would absolutely be better off 'swapping places' with them. Most people in this country would. 

The scrutiny is a lot, but the media is generally pretty god damn positive towards the royal family. Yes, the harry nazi thing blew up, but people got over it quickly. What else? Ummmm nope, that's all I can think of.

This is a problem were we live. Loyalists refuse to see things from the point of view of the other side. Even though you don't agree, Bobby sands is a hero to nationalist people. He lived in a sectarian state that was organised in such a manner that Catholics/nationalists were not given the same opportunity as their Protestant/unionist counterparts, they also wanted to remove a foreign imperial power that occupied this island and violence was the best way to achieve it.

The majority of the UK isn't represented well in the EU.  We're divergent.

&gt;You mean negotiation, as in ""give us X and we'll give you Y""? 

That's not negotiation of a bill, that's quid pro quo - like I said.

Go and have a look at a plenary session.  It's difficult sometime to even know what they're voting on.  They have voting sheets to tell them how to vote.  It's a cattle market.

Believe it or not not all EU countries are net contributors or in the Euro.

&gt;When some countries have a budgetary shortfall, the more fortunate ones pick it up. Does that not sound sensible

NO, that's the very reason why it was put into the treaty to stop contamination, and to promote containment if there is an issue, not that anybody is paying it any attention.  The whole point of the regulating nation spending and not allow states to rob Peter to pay Paul was to prevent a domino effect.

WHAT?

Where have other states been taking on and sorting other state's debt, and taking on their own haircuts and effectively mutualising debt.  Where have you been?   Italy was made to lend to Spain at a lower rate than it could sell its own bonds, and have you not been watching Greece?

&gt; It's true that most nations have broken ERMII, but that institution's a total farce anyway.

Oh, that's okay then.  As long as it has been designated a farce it won't affect anything else like stripping Med countries of competitiveness to the central powers.   Just let them keep breaking the rules.

Now they're like, ""Oh no. He's the 'WAR' Doctor. That's different.""

So dumb.

Fact is the damn part was written for Chrostopher Eccelson and he said, ""I ain't doing it"" so they came up with a doctor incarnation between McGann and Eccelson to tell the story.

Then they're like, ""Take that Eccelson, we got Ollivander to play your shit. Your ears were too big anyway.""

But then they're like, ""Oh shit. The 11th doctor has referred to himself as such but really he's the 12th.""

So then they came up with this lame thing about the WAR doctor and it fixes the numbering back and saves them a few more years of having to come up with a way to explain the fact that the doctor will eventually have a 14th, 15th, etc... body despite saying earlier in the series that time lords only have 13 lives.

Don't get me wrong. I love the series. Just own up to the fact that Smith is now Doctor 12 and don't wait to explain away the fact that you're not going to end the series after 13.

You already showed us that The Doctor at some point regenerates back into his Tom Baker body and changed his name to The Curator.

Bergkamp was from an era gone by and even Huntalaar took years to find his shooting boots after leaving Eredivisie. 

There are plenty of other great forwards who have left Holland, only to completely lose their goalscoring form. Bony, Altidore, Dost, El Hamdaoui, Kezman, Luuk de Jong, Mertens and Bryan Ruiz are ones who comes to mind, so unless a player has a lot more to their game than pure scoring (de Jong for example).. It is tough to justify a forwards performances in Holland. 

As you say though, we don't have a ton of other options. Even if he doesn't adapt to the league, he can't be less effective than Jelavic.

&gt;There must be some sort of back story with him, homesickness, not adjusting to the language/culture, something has gone wrong, TERRIBLY WRONG.

He is a big drinker, know plenty of lads who see him out drinking- he used to go to the brick pretty often, and turned up with Timmy Cahill after the WHU game last season. His antics after the Croatia vs Iceland game show this is still an issue, but can't be fully blamed.

The main issue for me is that he is hyper 1 dimensional, he gets his goals by stealing half a yard on a defender and getting a shot off first time before he can react. This style takes a lot of confidence, which helped him score a lot when he first moved, but if defenders expect it- they can prevent it at the top level by keeping tight and pushing him off the ball. 

Just watch how many times he goes down in a game, he is so flimsy and defenders constantly take advantage of it. This is what I feel caused the initial reduction in confidence, so now even when he does steal half a yard (much rarer now they have adapted to his style) he doesn't have the confidence to know what to do with it.

Everton is a neighborhood rival, I don't hate em but by virtue of them being the other game in town kinda have to dislike em. I'm big on Leighton Baines, decent player and his hair looking looking like something from the 70s footballing era is awesome.

In the American system each station has one frequency and they just went from analogue to digital with each keeping a frequency and just changing to digital signals. Therefore there's plenty of room for 1 HD version of their main channel plus a couple of SD 'sub channels'.

Here each channel (BBC1 etc) had it's own analogue frequency from each transmitter site - all had at least 4, some 5. When we switched to digital we changed so all the channels were grouped together on multiplexes, each taking up a frequency from each site - at least 3, some 6. So the BBC had one multiplex, C4 and ITV shared another etc. We used the extra bandwiodth to launch channels like BBC3/4, ITV1/2/3, E4, More4, Dave etc

An HD TV service takes up more space than an SD one. So for HD to become the norm a lot of channels would have to close as there's just not the room on terrestrial TV.

A UAV being flown in UK airspace is exempt from European Small Aircraft regulations if it is under 150kg. UK Regulation Air Navigation Order Article 98 still applies, however, although many articles depend on the aircraft being over 20kg. Basically, this covers reckless and/or negligent behaviour. There are no airworthiness standards for the airframe.

Any UAV that does NOT have a 'sense and avoid' capability must NOT fly:

- in controlled airspace

- in any aerodrome traffic zone (without appropriate permission)

- above 400ft AGL

- beyond visual range OR over 500m from the operator, whichever is LESS

- at night

- over or within 150m of any congested area of a city, town or settlement

- within 50m of any person, vehicle or structure not controlled by the aircraft operator, except during takeoff and landing, when the rule is not within 30m of any person except the operator and any other persons who must be present for the flying of said aircraft.



So, basically very similar to the FAA regulations, but still, it's always better to check. The one fuzzy part is what exactly they mean by a 'congested' area of a city, town or settlement, but I think that's just a case of being sensible and not flying anywhere where a UAV is going to cause problems, either by flying, or by having a problem and crashing (in short, don't fly above anything you're not prepared to ditch onto).",0,1386618681,null,0,false,0,cdxm12u,t3_1sgrpp,t1_cdxm12u,t1_cdxlvpc,null,1428324030,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Anyway, this means that that third of tenant-farmed land is owned by a land-owning class, either the old aristocrats or a new wealthy class who enjoy the subsides the land attracts.

Really, any of the first episodes following a regeneration is a good jumping on point, what follows is a quick, (almost)spoiler free analysis of the Doctor's first seven incarnations. Wall of text to follow.

The first Doctor has a bit of [Early Installment Weirdness](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness), In that the original conceptualization of the show was an educational program for children, with The Doctor being a foil for his companions, who were meant to be the stars.

The second Doctor came about do to William Hartnell's failing health, and the need to replace the actor who played the Doctor. Patrick Troughton set the precedent for a new Doctor being a departure from the precious one, while still keeping certain elements in place. Often refered to as a Cosmic Hobo, and one of my favorites, I highly recommend  watching his episodes.

The third Doctor was a James Bond like figure using Venusian Karate/Aikido and enjoying vehicle chase sequences. Of course, he was still the Doctor and reminded us of that in his first Serial [Spearhead from space](#s ""by escaping an abduction attempt in a wheelchair"")

The fourth Doctor had the longest tenure of any actor to date, and as such many who grew up watching the series think of him first when they picture the Doctor. He also spent quite a bit of time on Gallifrey itself. Fun fact:Douglas Adams worked on the show and wrote several scripts during the Tom Bakers tenure.

The fifth Doctor has been a bit maligned by the fandom as meek and somewhat ineffectual, though it's worth noting that David Tennant(the 10th Doctor) says Peter Davison is his favorite Doctor. The meekness comes from the natural departure from his predecessor who frequently showcased his superior Time Lord intellect by quickly solving many problems.

The sixth Doctor swung the pendulam very far in the other direction, and is seen by many as a jerk, although Colin Baker can hardly be blamed for poor scriptwritting. It's been said that his Regeneration Trauma was particularly rough this time, and that the Doctor was a bit disturbed and scarred by the process, but the show failed to really explain that. The Big Finish Audio Plays have redeemed the sixth Doctor immensely, so much so that he was voted favorite audio Doctor by the fans.

The seventh Doctor has a mixed reaction from the fans, low ratings eventually led to the shows cancellation, but now it has a cult following. He was a clown, but was slowly revealed to be a *sad* clown
and could also be quite the manipulative bastard at times. He was fond of having plans, though invariably thing would go wrong, and he would have to adjust.""Remberance of the Daleks"" is a prime example of this, and also contains the scene which inspired the creation of The Crowning Moment of Awesome Subpage of the TVTropes website,though you shouldn't go there.

I know this sounds very pedantic, but I'd prefer a project like this to be government funded, and without the influence of major supermarkets, who would only be in it for the profit, not to actually help people.

This mindset leads to falling quality (supermarkets will care less and less that the food they're giving to these socialmarkets is edible/of standard quality if it means less time + money spent), an emphasis on the supermarkets themselves (in essence, supermarkets will only provide food to make these people shop at their supermarkets in the future, through things like advertising, branding etc.), and the prices would be very questionable, than if the government funded the project (because 'we're only in it for the money', as Frank Zappa once said).",0,1386620377,null,0,false,0,cdxmsvz,t3_1sh64r,t1_cdxmsvz,t3_1sh64r,null,1428323670,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15

true,[deleted],null,null,"IMHO, when riding a 125 - get your A1 licence soon after passing your CBT. I know this is an unpopular opinion but here's a rationale.  

I did it. I didn't need to pay for any lessons. I bought a book (£10ish), a copy of the highway code (£2.50), watched lots of YouTube videos and researched on Google for the test requirements and [Mod1 circuit diagram](http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/@motor/documents/digitalasset/dg_197120.pdf). I bought some plastic cups (£1 - Asda) to use as cones (Buy a tape measure if needed) and laid them out for practicing the low speed stuff. The rest I practiced and incorporated into my daily riding - looking behind you, left and right - it really is a life saver, even when *exiting* roundabouts, mirror checks when changing speed etc. No one hides this information - it's all there to read and watch. I had 0 faults on both Mod1 and Mod2 and my examiner argued with me that I'd obviously been riding bikes for years. I hadn't. I just hadn't tried to cram everything into a 4 day intensive course and then turn up still inexperienced. I'm no expert nor racer, I've just passed a test. 

You just rock up the test centre on your own bike, ride around some cones and then another day ride around some streets in the manner which by now you do normally anyway - just some guy is following you (try to loose him if you can, it's fun). 

Once you've passed your theory test you have it for life. You never repeat it, regardless of upgrading your licence. I personally think it should be a requirement *before* the CBT, but it isn't. Anyway, read the highway code - you're guaranteed to actually learn useful stuff. 

No, it doesn't cost the earth. No, it isn't a waste of money. No, you shouldn't wait until your x years older cos you can then get x licence.

Why would you ride with just one days training? When someone hits you - *you're just a learner* - how's that playing out with your insurance and the police - even family and friends. 

Personally, I found the inability to ride motorways very annoying for longer trips. You know how hard it is to plan diversions to avoid even the shortest stint of motorway where I travel to/from. Urgh. 

As for cost - I've know so many people say they can't afford to get a proper licence, so they stay on L-plates - always promising themselves they'll do a 'proper test' soon, in a 'few months when I can afford it' and 'when I get older'. The months pass and then the CBT is due to expire - and the guys then go and renew the CBT again. Another £100 for L-plates. Sigh. 

My argument is you can use that £100 to pay for the theory test (£31 - it's for life, remember) Mod1 (£15.50) and Mod2 (£75) on a 125. (£15 for books). You can spread these costs over upto 2 years if you want - you don't need everything at the same time. 

Teach yourself how to ride to the standard required - it's actually fun. Validate your skillset with a test. Remove the L-plate. Get cheaper insurance. Give yourself more ammunition in an insurance dispute. Remove the inevitable deadline of renewing your CBT. Rock up to uni in sept without L-plates! 

When you come to ride a bigger bike you'll be paying mega bucks anyway, cos you need to be accompanied by an instructor. The £100 you spent on A1 will seem like a bargain!

We are mainly a counter attacking team and to have defensive support on the opponent's side of the field is quite a benefit. The problem with Ramires is he tends to over extend into situations where he has to take the shots and leaves our defence exposed.

What really pisses me off is the fact that Weimann continues to play, he offers absolutely nothing to the team. He was great last year but this year, what's going on mate?

At home I want to see us play a 4-4-2. With Lowton back at RB. Bacuna on the left and Albrighton on the right. Throw a few crosses in and I'm sure Man. Utd would suffer against Benteke in the air.

Away, play a 4-2-3-1. Again, wingers and a tall striker. You'd have two CDM's to cover the defence (Westwood and Delph).


I reckon we'd play better if Lambert took of the players that are badly out of form. Weimann need's a break, Westwood and El Ahamdi haven't been brilliant every game either.

Deeply closeted but barely concealing his stiffy housemaster watches and especially appreciates those whose morning wood hasn't yet gone down and thinks it's funny to turn the showers cold to get everyone out.

7am - You needed to be dressed for 'stations' where you do some cleaning, usually something like polishing the brass pipes of the urinals until they shine, and also polish your shoes and iron your clothes.

7.30am - house assembly - where said deeply closeted housemaster praises his favourites' achievements and congratulates himself on something or other and picks out for 'punishment', seemingly at random, people who haven't done their cleaning duties well enough.  

8am - breakfast in a giant hall. Duck flying sausages. Much like the showers.

8.30am - chapel - hear about the evil sins of masturbation and homosexuality from a man in a dress who's clearly touching himself under there.

9am - Lessons. Hopefully a chance to catch up on sleep. Unless it's PE. Which is another chance for a child-hating sadist to victimise skinny or fat kids.

11am - Breaktime - mostly involving violence on the parade ground or smoking in the toilets.

11.30am - more Lessons. Which occasionally involved oral with the french mistress. Not as fun as it sounds as she was at least a hundred and you couldn't understand her in any language, let alone french. Or chemistry with the hopelessly out of her depth Australian exchange teacher, which usually involved a pool on which minute of the class we could get her to start to cry.

1pm - Lunch. More flying sausage. And spotted dick. Yes, that was a real thing. No, seriously.

1.30pm-ish - Watching Going For Gold in the common room. To which we were all inexplicably addicted. I have no explanation for this.

2pm - Tuesdays and Thursdays - more lessons. 

2pm - Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays - institutionalised violence aka Rugby or fucking about with boats, which was brilliant actually, or shooting things, which was also brilliant.

5pm - Marching about the parade ground like twats for 'Divisions Practice'. 

6pm - Tea. Yet more flying sausage. And flying lumps of butter. And flying bowls of pink fluorescent jam that allegedly had small bits of wood in to represent pips, as we were still getting through barrells of the stuff made for consumption during the war.

6.45pm - Prep - And trying to remember what you were supposed to be doing for prep that night. And catching up on some more sleep.

8pm - Cleaning classrooms.

8.30pm - School play rehearsals, or Jap-Slapping lessons aka Tae Kwon Do club, or fucking off somewhere for another quiet smoke or whatever, or punishments if you've arbitrarily received them 

9.30pm - Official bedtime. Closeted housemaster checks you're all nicely tucked in. Bit of bedtime reading before the lights go out.

11.30pm-ish - bent as all hell and why doesn't he just admit it as he'd be much happier and wouldn't interfere with us and watch us in the showers housemaster fucks off to his annexe flat.

12am - when it's definite he's gone, treasured and well-worn porn VHS tapes get put on in the common room TV. Funnily enough 'Going For Gold' was one of the titles we watched there too.

1-2am-ish - masturbation-stupor recedes and bedtime proper, after another crafty smoke.

Repeat for weekdays.

Saturdays - Same, but after lunch is institutionalised violence or sailing or Jap-slapping contest against another school, followed by bus into town for consumption of excessive amounts of booze - from supermarket bought by bribing older kids if your bumfluff wasn't impressive enough, or in dodgy dive pubs there would be no risk of staff finding you in, if you could get away with buying booze, which was from about 14+ in the UK really.

Sundays - Bit of a lie in, but two hour-ish chapel service, with even longer and more boring sermons about why Jesus loved hanging out with other dudes but wasn't all about the cock really, honest, and then marching round a parade ground saluting at some Admiral or Colonel or other and trying to avoid getting caught making wanker signs at him. Then violent films, or play rehearsals, or weight-training, or having a fire by the beach and drinking cider and more smoking - weed sometimes, if you could get it - or some shit like that, for the rest of the day.

He's not quite solid enough to be the defensive guy like Khedira at Madrid or Martinez at Bayern, nor is he good enough at passing to be the pace-maker like Alonso at Madrid or Schweinsteiger at Bayern. For me he's also not a right-sided midfielder in a 4-2-3-1: not a superb dribbler (at least not consistently), not a good crosser of the ball, and doesn't really pose a threat of cutting in and shooting. Good enough I guess though for a team built to defend like in the CL final. However, that's not what we want moving forward. 

His best position is probably in a 3-man midfield from a 4-3-3, playing box to box. This best utilizes his tracking back, tackling, stamina, and pace on the counter-attack. In this position there are probably few players stronger than him. 

I've also though a lot about using Ramires as a right wingback in a formation like 3-5-2 or 3-4-3. He's got loads of stamina and pace, which combined with his defensive qualities should mean he could lock down a flank by himself. It would play pretty narrow (at least from the right), but he's good enough to give the ball to someone who can do something with it from wide areas.

The most obvious one that springs to mind is employer's NI contributions (and for that matter PAYE) - it's not just her that pays NI, it's also her employer. 

Considering you pretty much have to use proper payroll software (it's the law that you tell HMRC about who is being paid what as soon as they're paid - electronically, using appropriate software) and payroll software will automatically generates payslips (unless you use HMRC's own software, but it sounds like they'd have outgrown that) - I think you're right to smell a rat.

Even worse is without payslips, your SO can't prove to HMRC that tax has been paid on her wages. This could, in theory, make her liable for the tax.

ISTR there is an anonymous tip line you can call HMRC on - an audit may well encourage her employer to do things by the book. If that doesn't do the trick - personally, I'd be looking at other employment ASAP.

No it wasn't. It was to say conclusively, without argument, that this was the same person as The Doctor. The fact that it was a title text, saying that *this actor* is The Doctor was 100% fact, that you should accept it and understand that the show will not backtrack on that.

true,grollcool,null,null,"Ramires is one of my favorite players so I have avoided saying this for as long as I can remember but if we are not playing a 4-3-3 then Ramires does not fit into our system. In a 4-2-3-1 the 2 central midfielders come in generally two molds, a deep playmaker with the ability to control a match and a ""destroyer"" type who is a solid defensive midfielder and can do the dirty part of the game. A good example of this is Modric and Khedira, and Javi Maritnez and Schweinsteiger. One of the problem with our defensive midfield is that Mikel is a decent player but when it comes down to mastering the defensive midfield ""destroyer position"" he is not as good as the likes of Khedira or Javi Martiniez. Now where Ramires comes in is that he has a very unique skill set, and he doesn't really fit either of the two roles. Thats why picking a partner for him is so difficult, do we put in Lamps next to him, our best ""passing midfielder"" even though this isn't his best position and make our defense a bit light. Or Mikel, our defensive midfielder but then have neither of them able to really control the tempo and distribute the ball effectively. 

Now Ramires is making it hard to criticize him because individually he is putting in great performances but ultimately his style of play doesnt fit the 4-2-3-1 system and this hurts the team performance as a whole. The problem with selecting a good partner is that it is hard to find one with the skill sets required to compliment Ramires' style. We would have to find a ""passing"" midfielder who can also cover for Ramires and get stuck in, and unfortunately finding a player like that for Chelsea is near impossible because your asking for the best of both worlds, the most similar player I could think of is maybe Sergio Busquets but of course no chance of him coming.

Where Ramires would be lethal is in a 4-3-3 where his midfield partners can both compliment him. Him + a ""passer"" + a destroyer would be a great combination because he could burst forward more and help his teammates at defense while at the same time not being the only defensive midfielder to have that responsibility. 

**Possible midfields that could bring us to the next level:**

Pogba + Verratti

Pogba + Witsel

Witsel + Verratti

Khedira + Verratti

Gundogan + Pogba

De Rossi + Verratti

These are just combinations from players we have been linked with that together would be a complete midfield, and I know that these are very very unlikely to be seen at CFC. If we can get even one of these players it would greatly improve us and give us something to work with.

**Edit:** You might have also noticed that in a lot of my ""ideal midfield"" combinations that I included Marco Verratti, the reason I have is because he is the closest player you will find in world football in the Andrea Pirlo/Modric role as a deep lying playmaker with great ball skills. He truly is a gem and very young as well, the problem of us getting him is that he is one of the center pieces for the new PSG and they would never let him go easily. [Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=084PsycF52Y) is a video compliation of him  And [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNCDDS0X_98) is from one game, so you can see what he would do in a typical match.

Edit 2: In my opinion right now our current team is 2 world class center mids, and 1 world class striker away from being one of the best/most complete teams in Europe, our Attacking Midfield is as good as any other and we have two great GKs, our Strikers and center mids though bring us down a bit, our defense as well but to a much much lesser extent. Our defense while not perfect is not something that would require urgent solutions.

Australia under-17s captain Jake Brimmer is on the brink of joining Craig Johnston, Harry Kewell, Brad Jones and Dean Bouzanis as those to have played for the famous Merseyside club.

At this stage, there is no confirmation of the deal from Liverpool's end. Brimmer, 16, recently posted an image on Facebook of himself in a Liverpool jersey, proclaiming: ""My dream as a kid was to play for Liverpool, fair to say that dream has come true."" The photo was taken during one of his two recent trials with the club.

The deal comes as no surprise.

In an interview with The Australian before the Reds' game against Melbourne Victory in July, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers revealed that the club's scouts had discovered a Victorian kid who was ""a gem"".

""We are always looking to bring in great young talent and our head of recruitment may have found one,"" Rodgers said. ""I'm not sure where he (the scout) drove to, but he watched a game outside of Melbourne.The pitch was not in the best condition, but he spotted a kid who was absolutely outstanding. That's the sort of talent you have here.""

Brimmer, a midfielder, is regarded as one of the best young talents in Australia.

Off the field he is described as a good kid who has his feet on the ground, knows what he wants and is at a stage of his football development where he needs to be challenged.

His father, Steve Brimmer, told The Australian the deal had not yet been done, but negotiations were at an advanced state.

""Yes, it is very exciting and we are happy, but there are a couple of little things that need to be sorted before it is a done deal,"" said Brimmer, who used to play in the Victorian Premier League.

He said he was aware of The Australian's story in July and confirmed it was his son Rodgers had been talking about.

Here's another assumption to consider instead:

Granted, counting the Meta-Crisis, that makes Capaldi the 13th regeneration which is not supposed to happen, but that can easily be explained if the McGann &gt; Hurt regeneration is considered as a ""freebie"". Remember, McGann's Doctor had only minutes left to live after being brought back to life before it was over for good - he was supposed to have been killed too suddenly to have regenerated, so he was brought back to life and changed into Hurt's body before it was too late, and then resumed the normal regeneration ""cycle"" with the McGann &gt; Eccleston regeneration.

However, using that assumption would make Capaldi the 12th and supposedly last regeneration, but remember also that Moffat said that the regeneration question would be answered, so it's pretty safe to consider Capaldei as the 13th regeneration of the Doctor with a plausible explanation as to why the 12 regeneration limit ""wall"" was broken for him.

So to answer your question he has never made a conversion when he came from Brazil because he has always played as a CAM and continues to do so. Oscar can track back and put in a shift for his team but his true talents lie in his ability on the ball and his eye for a pass, his recent goal scoring streak has been nice as well. The tracking back part though is really just a bonus, it wasn't something we expected from him when we bought him from Internacional and isn't something you naturally would ask from a CAM.

Also, i am not familiar with Everton Ribiero but don't take Oscar's transition to the PL as proof that this guy will do well. Oscar is truly a one of a kind player and this Everton Ribiero could turn out different (or same) but that is completely down to the player.

The law is as follows, in the Fraud Act 2006.

*(1)A person is in breach of this section if he*

*(a)dishonestly makes a false representation, and*
*(b)intends, by making the representation to make a gain for himself or another*

*(2)A representation is false if*
*(a)it is untrue or misleading, and*
*(b)the person making it knows that it is, or might be, untrue or misleading.*

Do you see the word ""act"" anywhere? The law is concerned with representations in this instance.

""Dishonesty"" is defined in R v Ghosh and relates to whether or not the seller knew what he was doing was dishonest, and whether the reasonable person would consider their behaviour to be dishonest. Which any sane jury would conclude he was, as it is abundantly clear this was a scam intended to deceive people.

&gt;the honesty is far stronger than the dishonesty, because he listed the thing as a photo.

Now I've spent enough on this subreddit to know what the general political mood is around here, so downvotes will come as no surprise. But it might be worth considering that when people of a certain mentality can get free stuff, they have a tendency to take it.

ie: not everyone who is taking from a food bank is literally reliant upon it, but can of course use a food bank so as to not have to spend their own money on food.

I see you've already done the admissions test. Why, back in my day, one took the test in an impressive University building! Clearly some things have changed so don't blame me if any of this is outdated, I'm not omniscient.

On the first day, there are no interviews. You'll get the key to your room and some papers and be shown to your room by an undergraduate volunteer. You'll have a shared bathroom with 4-6 other interviewees, and a sink in your room.

There are a few common rooms you can hang out at and chat with people (interviewees and students), they have tea and biscuits and such and there's a board which you have to check regularly which has your interview times. You'll have 2 interviews at Merton plus any number of other interviews at the same/other colleges may be added later.^*

For each interview aim to arrive at the correct college 15 minutes before, the volunteers will lead you to the room of the tutor and you just wait until they call you in. If you're a bit late the interviewers will assume there was a problem finding the college or whatever and it doesn't affect your application.

The interviews are something like 20 minutes if I recall correctly, and will all be mathematical problems or they'll ask you to explain something they've already solved. Some colleges will give you some problems on a sheet of paper a few minutes before the interview, but you won't have to write the solutions, just discuss them.

One of my interviews did have some light questions, but this is only because he ran out of real questions.

The most important thing is to say what you're thinking and talk through a problem when you're given it. You won't necessarily be given all the necessary information straight away so it's okay to ask questions and talk about the possibilities/assumptions you're making. So for example, if the answer is n! it's better to say ""well, I can see that it's less than or equal to n^n because..."" than to just say ""I don't know"". Similarly, if you've blanked on how to do integration by parts^** , just say that you want to do integration by parts then try to work it out, they will step in and help when necessary.

Don't take for granted the interviewers have seen your personal statement as it isn't always the case.

It's a good thing you've decided to wear clothes to your interview, the details beyond that are irrelevant.

----

For interview prep, [How to Solve It](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Solve_It) is strongly recommended, you should know last year's maths almost back to front, and if you are ambitious and have done the Maths A Level and are doing Further Maths A Level, you can stab STEP I (and some STEP II) problems in an untimed setting.^**

----

Beyond the interviews and taking advantage of the free meals what you do is up to you. Personally I prepared for interviews before arriving and didn't feel like doing so when I was already there. Cramming is not possible in maths so if you haven't already learned something don't bother - or - ask one of the volunteers to explain it to you ;). Definitely don't expect to get any homework done! You might like to bring some pop maths books to get you ""in the mood"", if you already read pop maths books. Martin Gardner, Simon Singh, Ian Stewart, etc.

The JCR will put on a few light events (movie nights, etc) and the bar will be open. You'll also have access to the two college libraries - the MOB library is the oldest library still in operation, and the OWL library across the road has the maths collection.

There's an intriguing bookcase in the MOB library called Mertoniesia, it's filled with books about Merton and books written by Mertonians. It even has a small green booklet of quack medicine from about 1850 which assures you that it holds all the secrets to health and happiness.

You'll also have free access to all the colleges that usually charge admission, like the huge Magdalen College with a deer park. Be sure to wander around the colleges you get interviewed at to get a good feel for them. Not much time in the day this time of year though!

----

For a good treat you have to visit [Shakespeare's Milkshake Bar](http://westgateoxford.co.uk/shops/shakespeares-milkshake-bar) near Cornmarket Street which, in my opinion, is better than the more popular Moo Moo's. There's also Ben's Cookies in the [Covered Market](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covered_Market,_Oxford). And I'm sure the volunteers will all have their own opinions on where else to get food.

----

If you're ever lost just pop into any college, they will always be happy to give you directions and if somebody's available they might guide you there.

^* Don't do what one bunch of Merton interviewees did - post a note on the board saying all the interviewers are over and you can go home. [This kills your admission](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sad-crab-this-kills-the-crab).

true,RedofPaw,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;I think it's much harder to be a royal than it is to be a web developer or computer programmer or whatever most of this subreddit are.

You have no idea how hard the lives of Reddit users are. Don't generalise. 

The problem with your blanket statement is one of degrees. Sure, certain PARTS of their lives may be harder, but as a whole, in general, their lives are many, many times easier than almost everyone else. In this country. On the planet.

Even 'web developers' and 'actors in films called Rampart' can suffer from the ups and downs of life. Job security is further away than ever and misfortune can hit anyone. Yes, including monarchy, but it helps when you have an immense fortune, influence and the support of pretty much everyone.

A computer programmer breaks his hand - suddenly he cannot work. That may be ok in the short term, but perhaps it leads in the long term to unemployment. Perhaps he has savings, family support, friends. Perhaps he doesn't. Such a person can go homeless. 

A person in the royal family will NEVER see that level of misfortune. Do not underestimate the effect that that sort of security can have on your life. Imagine NEVER having to worry about your future? Ever.

There are responsibilities but the stresses most 'normal' people are under are a different world.

&gt;the lifestyle wouldn't be great compared to a normal person. 

Excuse me? What? Are you joking?

You must not like high society parties, polo, holidays, having the run of some of the greatest houses, castles and palaces in the UK and abroad as well as all the other opportunities such a person can enjoy. 

&gt;giving up the perks of a normal life.

They have plenty of perks. You don't think they go to sporting events? Holidays? Travel? Golf? Walking in the countryside? Beaches? Forests? Tea Partys?

What are they missing out on? Walking down the street? I've walked down plenty of streets. They're not that great. They're ok... but you'd not miss them if you couldn't walk them and instead had other options.

&gt;If your parents are well paid doctors, successful lawyers, accountants, bankers (or even union leaders!) you could also grow up never worrying about money and spend all your time traveling or doing charity work or whatever you want. 

Well, sure. There are plenty of wealthy families who's kid's get to fuck about on the family money. So? They're ALSO incredibly privileged. Kate Middleton was one of these. I don't see her protesting too much about marrying into such a life. She didn't have to. I guess she made a sacrifice ;)

&gt;I know tons of people who never paid for their own houses, cars, holidays or anything else because of their parents or inherited wealth

Good for you. I know tons of people who have struggled to find work, have struggled with debt, crime, bad areas. 

&gt;that's a hell of a lot more enjoyable than being a royal imo.

For that 1% of people, sure. For the majority of people? No.

&gt;I think the constant travel, constant meetings, pretending to look interested and basically ""doing your duty"" would get very annoying very quickly, and it's pretty amazing that she chooses to continue doing it.

Don't get me wrong - I like the queen - she's a class act and I bet she smells really nice.

But let's not pretend she doesn't have a very good life and let's not pretend she couldn't have a very easy life if she wanted.

She has the choice.

Choice. The thing most people do NOT have. Most of us have no choice but to work.

Maybe not in the circles you frequent, but back down here with the proles I think you'd find most people would be more than happy to sacrifice their worries for royal ones.",0,1386629018,null,0,false,0,cdxqw5x,t3_1sggu4,t1_cdxqw5x,t1_cdxowu8,null,1428308718,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Personally I would hope that if I were a juror I would be allowed to do any and all research I like - but if I have to sit there and be fed lawyered bullshit with no sunlight I might as well be a mushroom for all my mind is worth.

In all I think the judiciary are stepping way overboard in protecting their industry.

true,Freddichio,null,null,"I disagree in that we are a counterattacking team - with the talent in the likes of Mata, Hazard and Oscar we can create space and my personal favourite style of Chelsea play is when they play the slow possession game - it's not uncommon for an attack to go back to the defense and for them to play the ball forwards while Hazard and co get into better positions. Ramires works fantastically with William and Schurrle as the fast counterattacking style but we're not Tottenham - we have other styles to play. I think Ramires should be ideally in a squad rotation - if we're playing a team like Sunderland when we expect to dominate (ha) and our speed is a major bonus we should play him, but against bigger teams like Arsenal, when we should try and control the game from the midfield, he's not the right player. His control, passing and shooting are major letdowns.

I feel we need someone to replace Lamps - in big games we can play Mikel to act as a pivot and not be caught out of position, while the other midfielder (for instance, Lampard) just sits back, receives the ball, and passes it to someone in space to create more opportunities. Ramires isn't that player, and he doesn't have the defensive mindset to be able to reliably stop the likes of Liverpool from breaking away on the counter attack.

IMHO, we need a new Lamps, so we can rotate Ramires. He shouldn't be an auto-start. Hell, Montolivio would be good in his position...",0,1386631107,null,0,false,0,cdxruh9,t3_1shijh,t1_cdxruh9,t1_cdxnc2r,null,1428308273,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

Funnily enough, major roads block human movement just as much as animal. If you look at the footpath network, you often see huge webs of walkways between two towns or villages cut off by a motorway or dual carriageway. So journeys that might be made directly, through the countryside, by foot or by bike, have to be made indirectly through tunnels of development, by car.

You arrive, are greeted by an undergraduate 'runner', shown to your room and given a timetable. Hot food is provided three times a day and you can usually get a hot drink whenever you like. You'll be expected to meet a runner a few minutes before each interview so they can walk you to where you're going (you won't get lost!). You'll be asked to stay at the college until they're done with you, and occasionally people get asked to go to interviews at relatively short notice. Take some combination of an interesting book, homework, laptop - I actually took Borat on DVD and a bottle of gin and had a film evening with a few fellow interviewees which was nice.

I had three interviews in total, two on the day after I arrived, one the day after; the first two were at St Hilda's, the third at Hertford. I wore jeans and a shirt with some shoes, which is more-or-less what all the interviewers were wearing iirc. There were 2 interviewers in each interview.

The structure of the interviews was 5 minutes talking about the personal statement which they'd clearly never seen before, which was basically an ice-breaking and checking-that-you-had-actually-read-the-books session. Then we god cracking with a whiteboard (Hilda's) or a piece of paper (Hertford) where I was asked to answer maths questions, starting simple and getting gradually harder until it was undergraduate-level stuff - which is to say, they will ask you questions you don't know how to answer and see how well you do at making things up. 

The sort of questions I was asked ranged from: 

&gt; There are six people, A-F, seated randomly at a table. What is the probability that A is sitting next to B? How about that A is not sitting next to B?

to

&gt;Sketch exp(x). Sketch 1/x. Now sketch exp(1/x): Can you describe what happens to the gradient as x-&gt;(-0)?

It's important to realise that they don't expect you to get the answers right. What they're assessing is your willingness to have a go, take constructive criticism, and remain coherent under a bit of pressure. If you manage to do those things, you've done fine. It's also important to remember that they want to accept you - they invite people to interview in order to accept them, and everybody's sad when it doesn't work out.",0,1386631204,null,0,false,0,cdxrw3c,t3_1sgfbq,t1_cdxrw3c,t3_1sgfbq,null,1428308252,2,false,oxforduni,t5_2s4rg,2

I don't know much about their defenders, but it'd probably be:

Mig

Johnson - Sahko - Skrtel - LB?

Lucas - Allen

Sterling - Coutinho - LW

Suarez.

I don't know much about their other options, but Sterling seems to have been getting some minutes lately.  No clue who their left back and left mid will be at all.

I'd like to see us do more or less what we've been doing

Lloris

Walker - Kaboul - Chirches - Vert

Mousa - Sandro

Lennon - Holtby - Townsend

Soldado

I think if we have Sandro try to mark Suarez out of the game, and use Holtby's energy to really pressure that midfield, we have a decent chance to disrupt Coutinho, and take advantage of Allen being there instead of Stevie.

Whoever we play on the left, they need to be tracking back if Sterling is on the right, because that kid worries me a bit.  

Moses is over there on loan, and I haven't seen much from Aspas, who I seem to remember them being pretty high on early this year.  Either one of them could potentially play on the left.  

There isn't much physical strength in a Lucas/Allen/Coutinho midfield, I'm hoping they play that and we can basically run them over with Mousa and the Beast.

Inbetweeners is definitely one that you should try to catch, it's hilarious, and also series 1 &amp; 2 of Skins (more of a dramedy than a comedy but has a similar tone to Misfits). Skins does hit its peak in S2 and goes downhill from there, though. S3 &amp; S4 are okay but I wouldn't even bother with S5 or S6

It's slightly older but I also find Peep Show (another C4/E4 production) to be hilarious, but it's a different style of humour really. It's very cringing to watch.

-
----------------Mignolet----------

Johnson---Skrtel/Agger---Sakho/Agger---Flanagan

------------Lucas-------Allen------------

----------------Coutinho--------------

--Sterling-------Suarez-------Luis Alberto


This goes off the assumption that Henderson is injured. If not, he replaces Alberto on the right with Sterling moving left. 

Another option is Moses coming in for Sterling or Alberto, though he's been on poor form lately and playing both Sterling and Moses on either flank didn't work out against Hull.


The central defense is fairly uncertain. The last three games have seen Kolo-Skrtel, Skrtel-Agger, and Skrtel-Sakho pairings. This might suggest that Skrtel keeps his place, and, with Rodger's tendency to not rotate after wins, I'm guessing Sakho keeps his place at Agger's expense. 


There aren't many other options. Mignolet, Johnson, Allen, Suarez, and Coutinho are all certain starters. Sterling likely keeps his place after a strong showing against West Ham. Flanagan is the most likely left back, especially since Cissokho played for the reserves today. Very small chance that Aspas gets a chance, but then the formation changes dramatically. I could see him as a substitute.

true,DrTenochtitlan,null,null,"Well, Doctor Who is one of the most lovingly restored of all television programs there is. Fans have been spoiled by the Doctor Who Restoration Team, which has gone as far as inventing new techniques to restore color to color episodes that were lost and recovered, but only in black and white. Other stories that are missing episodes due to the BBC junking them have been recreated using animation, or sometimes photo reconstructions with existing audio tracks. Virtually all discs come with commentary tracks and extensive documentaries, most of them specially produced for the releases. Some come with extras such as pdf files of old comics, or the original scripts. Because Doctor Who has required so much restoration (especially to the earlier seasons), the show has mostly been released on an episode-by-episode basis. Until every episode has finally been released (barring the discovery of more missing episodes, which is very possible), season box sets will probably not be available. However, discussion with those in the know suggests that if they DO become available, they will likely be vanilla releases with just the restored episodes themselves and nothing else, since most die-hard fans want the extras and will already own the individual DVD's. This is also why the individual classic releases are relatively pricey. For example, the costs involved in animating just one missing episode are very high, and have to be recouped.

This corresponds to the fact that there are so many right-wing newspapers that press out alot of tabloid crap (the Sun, the Daily Mail, Daily Star, Express etc.). While there are some very good right-wing broadsheets (Telegraph, Times, Independent), I still think that the Guardian has a better reputation than these. 

Which means that the left will feel that they have the best news source, trumping all others, and perhaps declaring the right as having 'bad sources', meaning a leftie paper will always be trusted more here than any right-wing one.

I'm not really a legal expert so this entire post may be wrong, but I think when you are bringing a case against someone through the courts, there are only two ways to win the case:

The first one is the standard most commonly used for criminal law (e.g. murder). If I was brought to court by the CPS on the accusation of murder, they need to prove ""beyond reasonable doubt"" that I did it. That is to say, if the jury have any doubt in their minds at all that is justified, they should rule not guilty.

The second is commonly used in civil cases, where if you bring a case against me you need to prove that in the balance of probability I broke the law. 

There is a huge difference between the two. 

Say in a murder case you are thinking ""This guy probably did it but, well i suppose technically he could have been in the wrong place at the wrong time, but it would be a big coincidence"".

Under the former system you are not guilty, under the latter you are guilty. 

If you accuse the government of unnecessary intrusion into people's lives, you need to prove they are guilty. This is one of the problems with privacy laws in the UK, I cannot sue the government because they have spied on everyone in general, I can only sue them for spying on me specifically.

I would need to provide evidence that I had been spied on, and then the government would present an argument to the judge to justify it. 

If the judge thinks that, on balance, their actions were necessary then they win, if they think they were not they lose.

Naturally as well if the government lose (I don't think they will) then they will appeal right up to the Supreme Court, meaning you know that it's not going to be over quickly.

The OFT is responsible for all industry and business in the UK, the FSA is responsible for lending and is a small part of the OFT. As for them not being my regulatory body...

&gt;The FSA regulate the financial services industry in the UK. Their aim is &gt;to protect consumers, ensure the industry remains stable and promote &gt;healthy competition between financial services providers.
Source: http://www.fsa.gov.uk/

I didn't mention the FCA as it is not current and i was trying to make the post accessible to everyone with less ""fluff"". Apparently that makes me ignorant rather than helpful.

&gt;Under the OFT's Irresponsible Lending Guidance, firms should take &gt;reasonable steps to ensure that debtors can afford to repay their loan sustainably. In practice, this rarely happens.


Yup that's why the FCA is being made, everyone knows the system didn't work because we had a recession over it. The FCA is going to tackle lending on every level with stricter guide lines to rope in the cowboys who do disregard the rules. You are part right here. Firms do have several ways to tackle this from a simple questionnaire with a few instant rejection pit falls all the way up to having staff specifically employed to fine-tooth comb people finances. Is it uniform? Hell no and i think the lower end (questionnaires) are flimsy as well. Lucky for us only a few follow that, most use staff to check a bit more thoroughly.

The last company that i know of to do a loan on JSA was maybe 3 years ago before EU legislation came in forcing among other things the SECCI which details every charge possible in easy to understand detail.


Do the small independent businesses buck the rules? Probably but 99% of them do follow the rules and to assume the remaining 1% is a trend is nothing short of madness.


&gt;For many firms it's as good as cash

If so please name them. I've taken some time out to take a look at a few of the biggest uk lenders who make up more than 80% of the market on the high street. 


&gt;You must be in receipt of a fixed &amp; regular income and be able to provide documented proof to confirm this.

&gt;Many will aim for these customers

I think i just proved the specifically don't.


&gt;offer them over what they can afford to repay

Every website i listed above has something covering this. Most say borrow what you need but i can say that most company's start with a smaller credit limit to stop the over zealous types (it does also have a loss prevention aspect I'll grant you)

&gt;offer them easy rollovers

Thats a big nope, Max limit is now 3 from the EU laws i mentioned from 2010.
From money shop site, same page as above: *we may be able to agree to you extending the loan up to a maximum of 3 times*

&gt;rack up their debts, pile on default charges

Default charges are limited the same way bank charges are now limited. Lending is lending, the laws that bind coat all with no discrimination. To ""rack"" up a debt would require the customer to borrow far beyond there means and i don't see how that's entirely on the company's...i don't blame MacDonald's if my diet goes to shit. 

&gt;either sell the loan book to a third party collector, or go for a CCJ themselves.

Every single company i have worked with keeps debt collection in house. I've worked with 5 ( in the head office of 3) now so i can say i have a decent grasp of the situation. CCJ's only occur after months of payment attempts and 0 cooperation from the customer. Im not saying its a nice route but its a business and they won't just hand out money with no intention of getting it back. People seem to think businesses can absorb huge losses from the profit but if that's the case what the hell is the point of a business? Its not free money and people need to take responsibility for their own financial independence.

How hard is hardship to get? In truth it wasn't really thing before 2010 but since then I've handed out maybe 2-3 a month while working a store. That's across 2 company's, which granted isnt a large sample size but is still something. The recession hit hard and caused a lot of them but with a little help some good people who got thrust into a shitty scenario have had the help they needed.

In closing, I'm happy to continue this dialog but lets keep it nice. We have conflicting views and accusing my lack of details on a few fronts to be classed as ignorance or me having a rose tinted view doesn't benefit the conversation at all.

Yes, British Universities are free at the point of use. You get a loan, which you pay back when you are earning enough (over £25k under the new system). I quite clearly said that in my original post. And if you go to a good university, a British degree is understood, respected and valued worldwide. If you spend £9k/yr to go to east anglia, then you're just stupid.

And despite moaning about the welfare state and a stupid TV show, it has done nothing but grow over the years, providing more and more benefits. While a life on benefits isn't great, it's perfectly possible to live on it, evidenced by millions of people who have relied on it at some point in their lives. It's a safety net, not a way of life.

I know that foodbanks are run by charities (did I say otherwise?). But I'm saying that it isn't the governments fault that the British public turn to food banks. Even the most basic benefits package (assuming you don't have kids etc) provides enough to buy enough food to live on.

If the BPI wants to filter out internet piracy sites with a web filter it should pay for its own, or use a government firewall at worst.

anyone else think a charity that has unlimited access to filter the countries internet for 'child porn' but blocks sites like imgur used to spread information freely a bit odd?

Don't forget that the 'piracy' site filter is this technology too.

During 1996 the Metropolitan Police told the Internet Service Providers Association (ISPA) that the content carried by some of the newsgroups made available by them was illegal, that they considered the ISPs involved to be publishers of that material, and that they were therefore breaking the law. In August 1996, Chief Inspector Stephen French, of the Metropolitan Police Clubs &amp; Vice Unit, sent an open letter to the ISPA, requesting that they ban access to a list of 132 newsgroups, many of which were deemed to contain pornographic images or explicit text.[8]
This list is not exhaustive and we are looking to you to monitor your newsgroups identifying and taking necessary action against those others found to contain such material. As you will be aware the publication of obscene articles is an offence. This list is only the starting point and we hope, with the co-operation and assistance of the industry and your trade organisations, to be moving quickly towards the eradication of this type of newsgroup from the Internet ... We are very anxious that all service providers should be taking positive action now, whether or not they are members of a trade association. We trust that with your co-operation and self regulation it will not be necessary for us to move to an enforcement policy.
—Chief Inspector Stephen French, quoted in Web Control

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Watch_Foundation#Background

If the government wants to censor the internet it IS THEIR responsibility to do so and declare it openly. It is also THEIR responsibilty to maintain and deploy a censor. The same for a industry that asks the Government to do so. A false charity paid for by a stealth tax on your internet.

""The IWF is an incorporated charity, limited by guarantee, and largely funded by voluntary contributions from UK communications service providers, including ISPs, mobile phone operators, Internet trade associations, search engines, hardware manufacturers, and software providers. It also receives funding from the Association for Payment Clearing Services and the European Union.[7]""

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Watch_Foundation#Legality

The government likes this conclusion as it allows it to have the supposed moral upper hand on internet censorship worldwide, whilst doing the same by the backdoor itself.

I would rather see http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4f/Batelco.blocked.png
than http://cdn-static.zdnet.com/i/story/13/39/340073/piratebay_1.jpg

at least its honest. but then the government couldn't churn out propaganda like this.

Mata will turn and penetrate, Oscar will look for quick connections to keep the play moving at the tempo that Mourinho demands. Different strokes for different folks. 

To the original question though, I'm not sure where he was most prominent in Sao Paulo but he can most definitely be deployed as a CM as he is very good at picking up the ball on the run and looking for quick outlets, while maintaining a pretty decent defensive work rate and ability to break up possession.

If Moyes brings him and plays him at CM, he'll turn into the next Anderson. Maybe he wants depth, but I think CAM is already a position that has enough depth at United. I think he wants to play him as an inverted winger on the right side.

I could be wrong, and maybe I haven't watched him enough, but in my opinion, considering Man Utd's needs right now, Moyes is after the wrong guy.

Then when people say ""well that would take him off this list then"" I reply with ""well then the same could be said for Gareth Bale...without his hattrick against Valladolid, his minutes per goal ratio would be much lower than Suarez's at 1 per 135 minutes.""

true,FaggotCaterpillar,BR,brazil,"I'm Brazilian, have watched plenty of both (especially Oscar), so let me give my two cents. First off, they are very different players. Oscar is and always has been a playmaker with great vision and passing. Everton Ribeiro is the epitome of Brazilian players, a quick attacking midfielder with some nice dribbling skills and an eye for goal. However, he is already 24, only had one good season, and overall I do not believe he has anywhere near the potential that Oscar does.

The award for best player in the Brasileirao can be misleading. Some past winners have gone on to be great players (like Tevez or Neymar), but others have never come close to those levels (have you heard of Conca or Diego Souza?). The Brasileirao this year was pretty weak, and while he did score some phenomenal goals, I'd wait to see if he was just a one-season-wonder like many promising Brazilian players before him.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I think this is a bit simplified, but gets at why I think Ramires is by no means world class: he isn't good enough at anything in particular.

Ramires basically has one outstanding attribute, which is his work rate (and actually you could throw finishing in their I suppose). Past that, his qualities range from pretty good to poor. He is a pretty good defender (people consistently overrate him in this aspect, his positioning is often suspect and he gives away too many fouls), he is a pretty good passer, a mediocre dribbler, and a poor link-up player.

He is a jack of all trades, master of none.

What does this mean? In my opinion it means he's an invaluable player to have in the squad, but not a player you want in your first choice 11. The reason I think managers love him so much is that he is so unbelievably versatile. No matter what system you play, or really what position you put him in, he will do a good job. The only time I would say he really, genuinely excelled for us was when we were playing purely a purely transitional game under DiMatteo, as that system demands more athleticism than most of our current squad possesses.

Ok so if he is only a decent player, why has he so consistently been in the starting 11? This one I think is really easy: he has been a stopgap the entire time he's been at Chelsea. Since his arrival we have consistently not had very many real center midfielders. During his first season, we had Essien, and he was still adjusting. He had fewer appearances that year, and often appeared as a substitute. Since then we have not really had an established midfield. We have not found a true ball playing CM to play alongside Mikel, and so Ramires has always played, not because he is necessarily our best player, but because he is so versatile. I think perhaps it might be more correct to say that he is the *second* name on the teamsheet, because he will always be in it no matter who you choose to play alongside him at CM, as we cannot form a genuine CM pairing.

I think the players you have in a world class starting 11 should all truly excel in their specialty, and I don't think Ramires does this. In the modern game, freakish athleticism can complement world class skill, but not replace it.

Usually happens in show biz, people make unreasonable requests knowing they won't get what they want. That way when anyone asks they can cite creative differences as a reason they had to walk away. It ultimately gets them off the hook. Sometimes they do this just because they don't want to work with someone, no matter how much they get paid.

There's also the possibility, given this was earlier in the year, that it was well before any ""War Doctor"" plans with John Hurt. Meaning it would have been the 9th, 10th and 11th Doctors. So bringing back Eccleston would have made the story more of a final episode of the 9th Doctor era (especially given the narrative involved him exploring the future because of his actions) ...

From that perspective it would have made Joe Ahearne (who directed the most number of Series 1 episodes) the most experienced team member from that era, behind Russell T Davis (who isn't involved, obviously). Which would mean he'd be the best ""voice"" for how to handle the 9th Doctor. With Steven Moffet really being the best voice for 10 and 11. (Given Moffet only wrote two episodes of the 9th Doctors era)

Mutilating the genitalia of an infant who can't even comprehend what is happening, let alone give consent, should be a criminal act. If you started slashing at an adult's genitals you would be dealt with as a violent sex offender and rightly so. Surely the same offense against a child, helpless and wholly dependant upon the protection of adults, is even worse?

true,Sparklesnap,flair4,,"You're right; he's only 5'10"" tall. He was also known for his leaping ability, and was an absolutely transcendent header of the ball.

In a way, though, he proves my point. He was an amazing talent at heading goals in, and yet in 8 seasons with Everton, he only scored more than 10 goals once, only 56 league goals total, despite racking up 226 appearances; a strike rate of just .247 goals/game. To put that into perspective, Soldado already has a strike rate of .308 in the league, and we've all been disappointed with his returns this year.

For a player who was truly awesome at one skill (heading the ball), he just wasn't a great goal scorer. You can argue about whether or not his height was a factor or not, but the fact remains that he wasn't a great goal scorer. Whether or not his height was a factor, he was short, a great header of the ball, but not, in fact, a great scorer.

Moreover, I don't think any of the players we've been linked with have Cahill's ability to head the ball; Rossi certainly does not, Pato doesn't either. And my initial point remains, which is we need a striker who offers something different than Defoe or Soldado; aside from Cahill's ability to score goals with his head, he wasn't very great in holding up play, especially from the initial long ball out of the back, which we do still occasionally employ.",0,1386656169,null,0,false,0,cdy37hb,t3_1sgqaz,t1_cdy37hb,t1_cdxmn7j,null,1428302850,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3
