&gt; Your explanation of how to defeat this formation is for the other team to use all 4 of their midfielders to pressure our 2 CMs?

only when LFC have possession, besides that the team will play their usual style. Also the resetting option by passing back is always fine but its not ideal as it mean we give up any pressing power we had and allows the opposition to regroup. 

infact reading your message for a second time I think I describe roughly you plan [in my second comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1qwfed/why_4222_is_the_way_forward_for_rodgers_liverpool/cdhaey2)

Or does it come from confiscated drugs from police evidence?

Or possibly 'unspecified sources'.

The same questions for the Ecstasy trial.

Presumably they have legal exemption to do this or the matter should be investigated by the police force.

It seems rather unfair that channel 4 should be allowed to conduct a television event of smoking cannabis when people who use the drug for legitimate medical reasons are denied this opportunity.

Rose - First episode of NuWho, I personally liked this episode but I guess it would be okay to skip this and go straight to...

Dalek - The Dalek's first NuWho appearance. This episode also portrays the iconic Ninth Doctor personality of rage and badass

Empty Child/The Doctor Dances - Just a plain fantastic 2 part episode and introduction of Captain Jack

The Parting of Ways - Ninth's regeneration to Tenth

The Christmas Special - Ten's first episode

From here there's a lot of good episodes to choose with then but one I would suggest is Silence in the Library. Great episode and intro/end of River Song

The End of Time - Ten's regeneration

Eleventh Hour - Eleven's intro

Again, ton of good episodes to fill up for your liking here. I do suggest showing her some episodes that feature some important moments of River, Amy, and/or Rory. Watching Name of the Doctor might get confusing without showing your GF some Clara

Hope this helps! The reason I didn't dive too much into recommended 10 and 11 episodes is because they have plenty of good ones to choose from so I suggest showing her some of your favorites from them. I did detail into Nine more case sadly I don't know why NuWho fans tend to suggest skipping 9's adventures, he's my favorite Doctor!

&gt;Nimoy stated that the title originated from an incident in an airport where a mother introduced him to her daughter as Spock. The child was not convinced, and ""I am not Spock"" subsequently became the title for a chapter in the autobiography that discussed how he went about building the character. In the book he compared Spock's life to his own, in order to explain the differences between the personas of the two. **He did state that if he was to portray any fictional character, then he would choose Spock.**

If you're saying that Eccleston didn't want to be typecast, then I don't think that's the same situation.  Nimoy apparently maintains that he doesn't have a problem with the whole Spock thing, and he even wrote another book later titled ""I Am Spock"" to clear up the confusion.

Plus, like I said, I don't even need Eccleston to reprise his role as the Doctor.  He need not ever act in that role again.  I still don't understand what's preventing him from participating in *documentaries* where there is no acting involved.

It breaks my heart, because, like you, I love his portrayal. He wasn't my 'first' Doctor, not technically so, but he was probably the first I really got into.

It was designed as a continuation of the show before the current series came back, and the Eighth Doctor Adventures is literally designed with season premieres and finales and everything. So listen in order, it's well worth it!

**First:**

- [Main Range](http://www.bigfinish.com/ranges/released_reverse/monthly-series/perpage:0?filter[1]=8+-+Eighth&amp;filter[2]=&amp;filter[3]=&amp;filter[12]=&amp;free_search=&amp;release_number=&amp;release_start_month=&amp;release_start_year=&amp;release_end_month=&amp;release_end_year=)

(Start with ""Storm Warning"" and work your way up; however, skip the complete ""Company of Friends"" set and just get ""Mary's Story,"" it's the only one in the box that matters and it's available separately for $1)

**Then:**

- [The Eighth Doctor Adventures](http://www.bigfinish.com/ranges/released_reverse/eighth-doctor-adventures) (plus [""An Earthly Child""](http://www.bigfinish.com/releases/v/doctor-who-an-earthly-child-442) between 4.01 ""Death in Blackpool"" and 4.02 ""Situation Vacant"")

(These all take place after the main range audios; you can start with these if you want, they're more like the current series while the main range is more like the classic series, so it's more easily digested, but you miss out on a lot of awesome in the main range if you start from here)

**And finally:**

- [""The Light at the End""](http://www.bigfinish.com/ranges/released/doctor-who-50th-anniversary)

(Big Finish's 50th Anniversary Special; takes place sometime early in the main range for Eight - definitely pre-""Neverland"" - but it really doesn't matter when you listen to it, as long as you know who Charley is. And it helps to recognize the voices of Doctors 1-7, too, but primarily 4-7. Eight too, but you'll know what he sounds like by now!)

This is perhaps the biggest difference between the consitutent countries of the UK and the constituent states of the USA. To a very large degree, a person from Scotland would consider themselves Scottish, one from Wales Welsh, and so on. Yet if you were to take the average American from Boston, say, and plonk them down in Chicago, they'd be unlikely to feel they were living in a different country.

I'm not hugely familiar with the pre-20th Century history of Germany, but I seem to recall that for most of its history that part of central Europe was a patchwork of small princedoms tied together under the banner of the Holy Roman Empire.

true,Biokeys,num26,,"I think this is a bit better:

Q: So we first spoke to you in August and it's been ten weeks in England, in the Premier League. How are you settling in? What have you learned about your teammates? How much are you enjoying it at Spurs?

A: I'm good. I think the language is very important and I'm getting better at communicating with my teammates. They make things a lot easier, since the atmosphere in the dressing room is very good, as all of you who are here in the day to day running of the club know.

Also, it is important for me that my family is well. They are also increasingly adapting [to life in London]. I don't have any complaints about the two months I've been here. Everything is perfect.

Q: Are you happy with your form so far, Roberto?

A: Well, not 100%. It's true that the manager is trusting me and giving me minutes and I'm slowly getting better, but I am not a conformist and I want to give much more, because I think I have it in me and I want to express 100% of my game. Especially goals, which are what I most want to give to the team.

Q: Six goals already, though. So even if you're not 100% happy with your form, things are going OK in terms of goals.

A: I've scored six goals, but I wish I had scored more. I'm realistic and I know that I'm not completely happy with the way I'm playing and I'm not playing combinations with my teammates as much as I'd like, but I know that we're close to achieving that. What I want is to feel good when a match is over, to know that I gave it all on the pitch, and that I did my job 100%. I'm convinced we're not far away from this. I've scored six goals, but I wish I had scored a lot more. I want to keep scoring, since it's the reason they brought me to this team and I hope the two goals that I scored in the last three games are good for me and I can get on a roll.

Q: You scored early on, in the first game you scored, match winning goals. How important was that for you, for your confidence, whether they were penalties or not? And to get settled and become one with the fans and the team?

A: Goals are always important for a striker, whether you score them in a penalty, with your foot, with your face or any other way. As for the fans, they've been fantastic from day one and they give me the strength that I need on the pitch to fight and do my best to take the team to victory. It's true that I've scored decisive goals to win matches, even if they're penalties, but I want more. I think that the manager is asking a lot more from me than I've given so far, and I believe I'm capable of doing it.

Q: You mentioned December. What's it going to be like without a Christmas break, a winter break?

A: It's going to be different. I used to spend Christmas with my family and now I'm going to spend it with my teammates. But I think this is good because the public, the fans, which are the most important part of football are going to enjoy seeing so many matches, and especially the children who are going to be able to come to the stadiums.

Q: You're learning lots of different things here. I mean, you came from Valencia, beautiful weather. We're speaking now, outside it's raining, as always. What are you enjoying about life in England, since it's a big change?

A: I think the weather is the first thing everyone tells you will change when you move to England, especially coming from Valencia which has practically 10-11 months of sunshine. Now it's the opposite, and there's only 2-3 months of sunshine. But I think I came mentally prepared for what I was going to encounter here, and I have to look at the positives, and not concentrate on the negatives.

Cromwell managed to maintain power by controlling both parliament and the army with a constant switch between military dictatorship and a dictatorship with a Parliament. The Parliaments created under Cromwell were a farce. His campaigns in Ireland and Scotland were horrific. Funnily enough the spectrum of people who could vote for a MP under Cromwell shrunk but he was the one who kick started keeping a records of births, marriages and deaths outside of the church. After he was gone and gave his son the Lord Protector title, it gave momentum to bring Charles II back and restore a much weakened monarch. It also helped that Charles had a somewhat sensible head on his shoulders like his grandfather James I.

true,neonmantis,null,Derby International,"Easy and I genuinely believe it. Most societies including ours now accept that sexuality is beyond our control and that gay people have no more say in the matter than straight people. I'm fortunate that I' attracted to women about my age, others will have a thing for much older women and some, for whatever reason, may feel most attraction to young children. Is that their fault? I don't believe so. 

Yet we treat it as a criminal problem not a medical problem. In most other cases, if someones mind is particularly left field from the norm we offer them specialist support and help, but not with people who are attracted to children. Why? Does anyone believe that anyone wants to be a paedo? Most hate themselves for it which just adds another layer to the support they need. We should also consider that childhood is a modern phenomenon and that for the huge majority of our existence having sex with girls who recently come of age, so 10,11,12, 13 whatever, was normal and expected, in fact in some countries that is still the case. It is our perception that has changed but our bodies haven't had a chance to catch up with that. 

Another aspect, there have been reasonable arguments made that people who are consuming images of children online are engaged in harm reduction. They control their desires not to interfere with children but still require an escape route to fulfill their urges. Now, of course where there is paedophilia there is an abused child which is tragic so maybe we should consider synthetic paedophilia as an approach. Sweden at one point had no restriction on paedophilia and didn't target it, actual child abuse dropped. I would expect a similar phenomena to occur if the UK blocks BDSM and other stuff, people will no longer be able to play out their fantasy and may indulge in actual sexual violence to get their fix. 

Ultimately, it's a health problem. What happens in this country if you realise you're attracted to children? Can you get help? No. Can you talk to anyone? No. If you go to the authorities you're going to be in trouble. We perpetuate an already bad situation by driving people underground. 

So yeah, I was on this talking heads thing flanked by two mums, safe to say they went crazy. Usual nonsensical stuff about how they are completely evil and should be hung and all that. They got really pissed when I pointed out 1) that most people who interfere with children have been abused themselves and have been the victim themselves 2) that 90% of all violence and abuse against children is done by the family, not strangers, but people you know. I quite enjoyed it. 

We still live in a world where we persecute people for things they have zero control over. I'd like to see that change and I have no issue with defending paedophiles to do it.

""Ireland"" is the official name in English for the country *described* as the Republic of Ireland. There's definitely no debate about it, as it is stated unambiguously in the Constitution of Ireland:

&gt;Éire is ainm don Stát nó, sa Sacs-Bhéarla, Ireland

&gt;Éire is the name of the State, or in English, Ireland

In 1948 Ireland passed the *Republic of Ireland Act* which stated
&gt;Dearbhaítear leis seo gur Poblacht na hÉireann is gnéthuairisc ar an Stát.

&gt;It is hereby declared that the description of the State shall be the Republic of Ireland.

Note that this act did not change the name of the state as that would have required a constitutional amendment and thus a referendum. As a result the state is to this day officially called Ireland. 

Some context gives that the Constitution of Ireland also once included a claim to Northern Ireland as occupied territory. This gives motivation for the use of ""Ireland"". For this reason the British Government chose to avoid the use of ""Ireland"" with reference to the state. The claim to Northern Ireland was given up by the Republic in the Good Friday Agreement and since then the British Government has started to use ""Ireland"". However the name ""Republic of Ireland"" is the official name of the Irish national soccer/football team due to a FIFA decision in the 1950s.

I agree. 

&gt; Too many people on here want to apportion blame but cyclsists need to take some responsibility for their own safety too.

You're missing the 3rd party in this..

We have cyclists, drivers and more importantly (my opinion) bad road design.

Its the bad design that placed cycle paths to the left of these vehicles, and cyclists assume safety by cycling in them. Just like car drivers assume safety in their lanes.

what we need is not to attract the rich with nice loop holes and lower taxes but to actually make them pay, if you want to to businesses in this country then you pay the taxes and we need international laws to enforce this.

Dear All

This is just a quick email to add my voice to the no-doubt growing number of complaints in response to EE's filtering of the imgur.com domain on your 4GEE network. 

I must admit I find this to be a bizarre move on your part. Obviously blocking such a legitimate and heavily-used site is going to ruffle a lot of feathers. Internet access is essential to my work, but aside from this, I've been on the same contract with Orange coming up 10 years now and have had an excellent experience. It seems a shame that within months of switching to the EE brand I'm having to deal with something like this. 

I would urge you to take action on this as soon as possible to avoid what is turning into a PR nightmare. [Imgur.com is the 37th most visited site in the UK and the 62nd globally](http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/imgur.com). Needless to say, the amount of your users that frequent the site is very large indeed. 

I would appreciate any sort of communication from you regarding this - even if it is just an estimated time-scale of when you expect the site to be available again. I don't wish to get into dispute. I just want the service I am paying for - which includes unfettered access to legitimate websites.

true,AL85,null,null,"&gt;In my view, when it talks about people owning rape porn, I think of the guy who downloads videos from his .onion site in the deep web of actual rape footage.

So your definition of rape porn is what is already illegal? So what exactly do you think they are about to further illegalise? ""Simulated"" means acted, by consenting adults. Big Brother wants to morally police society and people like you are happy to support it simply because of ignorance. 

&gt;It shows no regard for the respect of another human being. 

Many films and video games ""shows no regard for the respect of another human being"", so that is a basic and simple minded argument for mass censorship of all media.

&gt;And the bottom line is that you can't prove that it was staged.

Generally yes you can, as they are produced by professional companies with contracted actors and actresses. You can't prove that it's real. You can't go about accusing people of rape because you don't like what they do.   

&gt; If you really think that all porn on the internet is consensual and filmed by professionals then you need to wake up and perhaps grow into this intellect you seem to be boasting about. 

So are you arguing for a ban of all porn? Yet another fucking stupid point.

&gt;If child abuse images can exist what makes you think that rape porn can't?

So you are comparing the acts of consenting adults in porn videos to videos of sexual child abuse? What a bullshit non argument.  

&gt;if you really think rape porn is ok and should be legal, take a stroll over to /r/beatingwomen and see for yourself.

Completely incomparable. Pictures of domestic abuse have nothing at all to do with pornography depicting simulated scenes. You clearly aren't capable of grasping this issue, which is why every point you make is fucking stupid. 

&gt;if you're ok with people being in possession of porn in that vein and walking the streets as voting adults then frankly, fuck yourself.

You want to take peoples rights to vote away because you don't like them watching pornography? Frankly fuck you, you fascist cunt. People like you are the real problem in this world, trying to impose your opinions on others, despite being denser than a plank of fucking wood with nothing to back them up. You are no different to the type of people that argue against homosexuality simply because they perceive it as immoral or distasteful. It has been proven time and time again that censorship has no positive impact on crime and criminality. The real travesty is that idiots like you are allowed to vote.

true,ParrotofDoom,english,Greater Manchester,"It might help you to know that I've been cycling for many more years than you've been alive.  I was cycling on the roads before anyone in London gave a shit about cyclists dying at junctions.  Before stupid ""superhighway"" schemes came about.  Over tens of thousands of miles cycling I can count on one hand the number of times I've been in collision with another vehicle, and on each of those occasions it was because the driver was *not looking through the windscreen*, being more concerned with a phone, or the alcohol in his system.

A good cyclist understands that the best way to ensure you're seen by others is to position yourself correctly.  That means not riding in the gutter.  It means taking the lane where necessary.  It means slowing down near blind junctions.  It means not filtering alongside large, unwieldy vehicles.  And if you do filter past such vehicles, you sit in front of them and gain eye contact, so they know you're there.  Similarly, you do the same to drivers of vehicles waiting at junctions you're passing.  You cover the brakes, just in case.  You get eye contact, so they can't ignore you.

Hi-viz vests offer no guarantee of safety, they're useful only to people who don't understand what's required to make yourself visible in the first place.  Most of the cyclists I see wearing them are 6 inches from the kerb, or 2 feet from the doors of parked cars.  In other words, they don't have the first clue what they're doing.  They split lanes at junctions and sit in the exact centre of the carriageway on right turns.

Bavarians are crazy about their Bavaria. Especially Bavaria was ""something"" since the 10th century. A Duchy at first and then a Kingdom until the German Empire fell.


We usually identify by our state or rather whatever a certain part of Germany was before the Allies put them together as one state. There's Schwabia, Franconia (the last part of the East Frankish Empire that's still remaining) and Bavaria in the state of Bavaria and usually, people care about that. 

Traditions vary from state to state and the whole purpose of the ""Deutschland über alles"" thing in the German anthem (or at least the song it's based on) was to promote the idea of a unified German state which sort of failed.

We don't ""pretend"" (I say that because it's out of question that the Bundesländer are a part of a federation sine our constitution clearly says exactly that and they also couldn't become independent even if they wanted to) that they are different countries though.

In terms of language, there's only Low German and High German as well as a small part near the Dutch border where they speak Frisian. In fact, there's another song from the pre German Empire times which is about what Germany should be and in the end, the language is defined as some kind of border.

Even though Low German is it's own language, it's really close to High German and High German was used to standardise the German language so everybody spoke it natively anyway.

We've got our own traditions though.

I can only assume you have some sort of serious deep mental disorder that prevents you from grasping reality. Footage of rape is illegal. Footage of simulated rape is not rape as it is of two consenting adults role playing a situation. Simulated rape features in many, many films. Should A Clockwork Orange be banned and owners of copies be criminalised? 

&gt;I simply cannot grasp how the possession of rape footage, simulated or otherwise, can be tolerated by a person who expects me to believe that they are a civil human being

You can't grasp it because you are an idiot. Evidently you can't differentiate between reality and fiction. I can only assume you are the type of dangerous person you assume everyone else to be. Censoring role play pornography has fuck all to do with a social duty of care.   

&gt;It should NOT be ok to possess and disseminate videos of women or men having their dignity violated and their rights ignored!

Which is why videos of rape and abuse are illegal. It's not for you to make decisions on behalf of consenting adults. You think your opinion of a person's dignity is more important than their own.

&gt;It should not be 'ok' for the violation of human rights and the abuse of a human being to be considered an acceptable fantasy

Says you. Many, many people watch violent and sexually explicit TV shows, films, games, read explicit books and listen to explicit music. Should we ban them all? Ban anything with scenes of torture? Is that what you want Mary fucking Whitehouse?  

&gt;t is an abomination, in every sense of the word.

Your fascist beliefs are an abomination. 

&gt;My sister was once raped, you fucking prick!

So you blame me? And everyone else not involved? For their thoughts? You're the fucking prick. A thick and ignorant prick. You're welcome to come try and attack me so as to prove that you are the violent sociopath that deserves to be locked up. 

&gt;You are a terrible terrible person. I hope rape affects your life. You are a terrible person. Fuck you.

You are a genuinely terrible person and a massive fucking hypocrite. A violent, dangerous, threatening hypocrite. It's people like you that attack people, not the thought criminals whose voting rights you want to revoke. Great ""trolling"" by the way you fucking fascist idiot. And you question my ability to be a ""civil human being"".

Wrong actually.  Given how soundproof vehicles are, if headphones are banned, so should car radios regardless of volume.

http://www.bikebiz.com/news/read/cyclists-with-ipods-hear-the-same-as-motorists-listening-to-nothing/013329

""we measured the ambient traffic noise at 79dB. With the in-ear earphones, the traffic noise was 71dB,"" states Ride On.""

""**We quickly established that cars are remarkably soundproof.** We measured the average peak of ambient traffic noise inside the car (with the motor running) to be 54dB, which is 26dB quieter than outside the car. **We rang a bike bell right outside an open car window and measured it from in the car at 105dB. With the window closed, the same bell registered just 57dB**""

here's a slightly more balanced list of the FEG suggestions (as that's all they are)

1). Create a single VAT rate of 15% – revenue neutral (Kwasi Kwarteng)

2). Move the majority of the cost of green levies onto general taxation with the aim of abolishing those taxes in the long run – £2.8bn cost (David Ruffley)

3). Abolish Air Passenger Duty – £1.5bn cost (Kwasi Kwarteng)

4). Abolish Stamp Duty on land for properties under £500,000 to boost home ownership among the aspiring classes – £2.4bn cost (Dominic Raab)

5). Abolish employers’ National Insurance contributions for unemployed under 25s, a ‘fair and equitable’ solution to youth unemployment  – £0.29bn cost (Brooks Newmark)

6). Freeze business rates for three years – £3.8bn cost (Dominic Raab)

7). Take ordinary workers out of higher rate income tax by raising the basic rate limit from £32,010 to £40,000 (plus the personal allowance of £9,440) – £5bn cost (Kwasi Kwarteng)*

I just see him as a total idiot. As I said before, all he does is try to gets votes, yet is too dumb to see he is doing the total opposite. By legalising gay marriage he hoped to get the more liberal vote, yet his internet censorship plans (which he introduced to get the conservative vote) just make him hated by the very people he had hoped to attract by introducing gay marriage. He tries to get everyone to love him, but only gets everyone to hate him. He is an idiot.

I don't deny he WANTS power, but I just do not see him doing this by slowly taking our freedoms away until we reach the point where he is a dictator.

I'm going to say her sentence - is the best we/cyclists/other road users or her could hope for...

I say this because I was on the same ride, and while I don't know Toby he is a member of my cycling club and to my knowledge I was about 10 minutes behind him on the same 100mile ride.

Most (though not all) of the roads on the route are narrow (mostly single lane) and full of bends. Its certainly not unreasonable to expect someone connecting with a cyclist round some of these bends.

Now - I'm aware you could argue she should be going slower, and that she should have been hugging the edge, but that applies the the cyclists too. And im guessing there's not much proof to say otherwise.  And regardless of what happened this is probably their defense in court.

And with that in mind its a tricky thing to prove otherwise.

In fact the only thing that can be proven was that she didn't stop (by her own admission) and she didn't call the police. And that's what she has been found guilty of.

On a personal note - id be happy if not stopping at the scene of a crime had a much bigger fine/points. But that's a whole other argument.

And its a shame she wont be answering for her (more worrying) speeding confessions.

Sets off on red light - Red and Yellow means ""Prepare to go"" Mr. Cyclist. Also bus overtook him with plenty of space and he had 2ft to his left where the cycle lane was that he could move into.

Bus moved out as he passed the cyclist.

Why didn't the cyclist slow down when it was obvious what the bus was doing?

&gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3-B-grnnC4

Apparently ""driving in assault mode"" is following at a 20ft distance, overtaking giving a 6ft berth and not pulling in until you're 20ft clear of the bike you've just passed.

Bus does nothing wrong but cyclist chooses to have a rant because a bus dared to safely overtake him and three other cyclists.

No, but you surely can't deny that they reduce the ability. ""Oh but those other guys hear less!"" while sounding nice ignores the fact that car drivers have far less to lose from a car-bike accident. When the risk is asymmetrical, deliberately lowering your awareness to the same level is stupid.

you're wrong then. I'll blame dumb car drivers for being dumb, and dumb cyclists for being dumb.

An attitude of ""a minority of people in that subset of road users sometimes ignore the highway code"" is not license for you to do the same.

So a cyclist listening to music isn't concentrating, but a driver listening to the radio is?  If you believe listening to music impacts concentration, you must be in favour of banning all sound systems from vehicles.

That's the point - most cyclists understand risk far better than drivers. You are blaming cyclists if you think headphones put cyclists at risk. 

 The science doesn't support you, unless you are arguing that ANY music is a distraction, in which case why are car stereos legal?

Every time a cyclist is killed, a list of what the cyclist was or wasn't wearing is listed in the paper, regardless of whether that played a part in the accident.  That is victim blaming.

That's the point.  They measured using 3 clicks below max as their base line, when in fact most people, especially on a bike will be listening at an even lower volume, allowing *even more* ambient sound to be heard.

Headphones don't block the sound drivers think they do, that's  science.

&gt; when actually paying attention is also pretty important and not something you've mentioned in your sources

Some people are distracted by music, some are aided by it. For example, we know on long car journeys, radio helps keep people awake.

For some cyclists, like car drivers, it will be a distraction, but for most it will help relax them (reducing unpredictable paniced behaviours)  or prevent them zoning out on a monotonous commute.

It is poor practice to decide ""I reckon I'd be distracted, so ban this thing"", without looking at the actual science, and the actual science is quite interesting, and like many cycling safety things, is counter intuitive to what many drivers reckon cyclists should be doing.",0,1384869456,null,0,false,0,cdhxqtw,t3_1qyzi4,t1_cdhxqtw,t1_cdhx4vy,null,1428597156,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

None of the cyclists want to get run over, and none of the drivers want to run someone over, so let's all just chill out and think of real ways to make us all safer.

With this, my mind is open either way.

On the one hand, cyclists are vulnerable no matter what, so really, it's in your best interests to just do everything you can to keep safe. Keeping your ears open and alert obviously adds to your general awareness and generally speaking, you always want to maximise your awareness.

On the other hand, as a cyclist, I don't *rely* on sound to keep me safe. Constantly looking around is what keeps me safe. The only time a sound is ever loud and distinctive enough to get my attention and warn me of something before seeing it is a siren. And you can hear those through most earphones no problem.

Furthermore, it's really unpleasant cycling with nothing but traffic noise and loud trucks and buses to punish your ear drums. You're obviously solo on your bike so you have no one to talk to. How many people enjoy driving without the radio or some sort of music or person to chat to in the background? Cyclists don't want cycling to just be about getting from A to B. We also sometimes want to *enjoy* cycling (or at least, not hate it) just as drivers would want to *enjoy* driving.

I'd like to see some data on how many incidents have been caused or correlated with cyclists wearing earphones whilst cycling before I make any judgement on whether it's truly dangerous or not.

true,LS69,eng-yorkshire,We are Leeds,"&gt; No, but you surely can't deny that they reduce the ability.

I do actually. The science doesn't support you. Headphones don't impact the ability to hear traffic in a significant way. Counterintutitive maybe, but true.  We know music calms some people, and calmer people on bikes behave in more predictable ways, and don't panic swerve into vehicles.


Also consider this - how much benefit does hearing traffic offer a cyclist?  A roaring engine behind you - where do you move to to get out of they way?  Vertically 50 metres, is the only safe move.

Anything in front or to the side, you can see, hearing isn't really much additional help there.

&gt; a minority of people in that subset of road users sometimes ignore the highway code"" is not license for you to do the same.

You need to read it again.  A cycle undertaking doesn't break the highway code.  

 In fact the highway code requires drivers to ""just before you turn, **check for undertaking cyclists** or motorcyclists.""

Personally I never undertake lorries/buses,  but given that is a legal move, the debate should be about how we improve visibility at junctions, more mirrors on lorries, wider filter lanes, more controls on vehicles entering the ASL etc.  

&gt; ""Some bad things that can happen are out of my control therefore fuck any form of safety!"" Sweet logic again.

Research has shown drivers drive closer to cyclists when they wear helmets. Drivers think they are safe due to the helmet and therefore take more risks with the biker's safety.

So in fact, counter intuitively again, wearing a helmet on the roads may well be MORE risky than not wearing a helmet. Using your own logic that we should be safe rather than right, we shouldn't wear helmets due to this research.

Helmets have a place - sports cycling. If your commute causes you to hit top speeds - 20-30 MPH, then that's sports cycling, and you need a helmet, but at 12-16 MPH for the average adult commuter, it appears you are creating risk for yourself.

&gt; But hey blame it on ""wot they reckon"" if it helps you sleep easier. :)

Well, I hope I've demonstrated that ""wot u reckon"", isn't supported by science, and that what you see as risky behaviour by cyclists, can actually be quite sane, rational safety decisions.

If Virgin media can't maintain their own network I'm not sure why the IWF block list should be blamed. It's not that hard, especially for an ISP of their size, to run a simple proxy and make sure it scales depending on the traffic.

&gt; I suspect that somewhere is a process or procedure that when the system detects X number of blocked links it just adds the domain wholesale. This has the bonus of being less resource intensive, you aren't sifting through hundreds (thousands, hundreds of thousands?) of individual links which reduces load on the system.

Last month's imgur outage on virgin was due to a break in [their fibre](http://community.virginmedia.com/t5/Up-to-60Mb-Setup-Equipment/Unable-to-access-websites/m-p/2029662#M136629), not their laziness to proxy something.

Also that solution makes no real sense, the IWF watch list has about 500 urls on it at any time. The technology and computer power to filter thousands of requests a second across a list that small has been around for a long time.

I'm probably going to have to tactically vote for either Labour or Lib Dem just so the Tories don't get in.

I'm also worried that Scotland votes ""yes"" to independence next year.  If this happens, England and Wales are going to be stuck in Tory hell for the foreseeable future because we need the Scottish votes to keep the Tories out.

He underestimates her a LOT in their first encounter and she is very classy on her approach while she is indeed trying to save people and the Doctor even. Even when she realizes that this is their final encounter and her probable death.

And she also knows that THIS doctor will have her future as a secret to her past, she knows now what he knows that she can't know in their future meetings.

And yet she can't discuss this with him, her most beloved being and confident in the universe, because he simply doesn't know her.

The rules for cyclists in the highway code are in addition to the rules that apply to all vehicles. Rule 163 states that you should only overtake on the left if the vehicle in front is signalling to turn right and there is room to do so. 

Rule 72 (for cyclists) states that you must not ride on the inside of vehicles signalling or slowing down to turn left.

agree totally.

I get annoyed at this idea that cyclists with headphones are somehow different to say cars with radios, or even worse cars that are soundproofed with the radio on.

The similarities are very close, to focus on just cyclists is nothing more than hypocrisy.

Cyclist passes a parked car, rather than wait for them to pass the car and swing back towards the kerb, a car overtakes the bike, while the bike is passing the parked car.  An illegal move.

Car sees they are in oncoming traffic and tries to swing back in by weaving straight at the cyclist.

The other scenario that is common - car overtakes a bike, but tries to remain inside the lane while doing so. They'd never dream of overtaking anything else while trying to stay their side of the white lines, but they with bikes.

Though he wasn't my favorite doctor, I think he's the most unique doctor.  Other than the new War Doctor, he's the only one that didn't dress like a clown, a pirate or a kid in a suit.  I tend to think that the reason people don't like Nine as much is because they associate him with the early awkwardness of the show.  The special effects were awful.  The writing wasn't great.  They started to work out those kinks in the second half of series 1, but he never had the benefit of the show when it was firing on all six cylinders.

I still hold out a glimmer of hope that Eccleston's refusal to participate in the show is at this point only a clever ruse by Moffat to hide Eccleston's involvement in the special.  I feel like the War Doctor HAS to regenerate after using the Moment and the audience would go nuts to see him turn into Eccleston, then Eccleston leaving there to meet Rose, knowing fully who she is and what she can do.  It would be a brilliant tie in.  But if he isn't involved with the show, I suspect we'll either see another CGI reflection or a regeneration into a young Eccleston, much like we saw with Hurt.

People often write the super rich off or mock them or whatever,  but that doesn't have the same effect as people blaming the poor for being poor, which may not be something you see if you mainly view liberal social media, but there is still plenty of people who do hold and express that view. 

The scorn directed at the super rich doesn't hold them back, whereas scorn towards those who are actually oppressed, such as saying those on benefits are lazy, actually does have an effect. I guess it depends what media you're viewing, because it may seem as if people generally don't scorn those on benefits anymore or direct hate at travellers for example, but there are still plenty of people who do, and that has far more effect than someone being mean to the rich, as those groups actually face discrimination and oppression in real life.

To have a rough idea of what's going on behind me, or to tell if a near object has moved behind me, I can use peripheral vision. To find out what's actually behind me I can look in the mirror, after looking in front of me to make sure things are safe. I'm at no risk of accidentally moving the steering wheel when I turn my head 20 degrees, if I move it at all- and I can look back to the road in a split second if need be. 

Cycling without handlebar mirrors, all I can do is physically turn my shoulders and head to look behind- all the while, holding on to the handlebars I need exact control over. I cannot safely look behind me as easily or as quickly as I can in a car. 

&gt;Ill put it another way. One a bike I have total unrestricted view. Someone in a car does not.

No.  That is not plenty of space.  Also notice the grates in ""cycle lane""  [Highway code](https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/static/hc/hc_rule_163_give_vulnerable_road_users_at_least_as_much_space_as_you_would_a_car.jpg)

But that shows the problem.  People like hammyman think a foot is enough space to drive past someone on a bicycle when they're in a large vehicle.

&gt;Bus moved out as he passed the cyclist.

Bus didn't move out enough, could have used the entire other lane.  Chose to speed past at a very close distance.  

&gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tY1MZyCQqHk[4]

&gt;Why didn't the cyclist slow down when it was obvious what the bus was doing?

Why did the bus do it in the first place?  Why did the driver try and crush him just to get to that red light?

&gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3-B-grnnC4[5]

&gt;Apparently ""driving in assault mode"" is following at a 20ft distance, overtaking giving a 6ft berth and not pulling in until you're 20ft clear of the bike you've just passed.

The first minute clearly shows the bus flashing his lights, beeping and gesticulating to get to the side.  Then the driver turns into his path.

Who, AAISP?

I don't think so. The ISP industry's dirty little secret is that bandwidth - while it's getting cheaper - is nowhere near as cheap as their selling price would have you believe.

How do they make any money, then? Simple. For every movie and music buff who can download 100GB in a weekend, they need to sign up a dozen grannies who only go online once a week to check email from their grandchildren who live a hundred miles away. (These are extreme examples, but you get the idea - one set of customers subsidises another).

It's still a tight business with minuscule margins though, so you need to cut other costs as far as possible. There's a reason why BT's support line is staffed exclusively by people called ""Gary"" who have inexplicably strong Indian accents - because those guys work for a fraction of their equivalent in the UK.

But if you say ""I'm going to set up an ISP with none of this cross-subsidising rubbish. None of this call-centre-in-India stuff. Just simple, reliable broadband with high quality support"" - your costs go up quite a bit. Some bugger's got to pay for those costs.",0,1384876105,null,0,false,0,cdhzxxu,t3_1qyvze,t1_cdhzxxu,t1_cdhyvj0,null,1428596105,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Edit: From [this article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/5334208.stm), referencing a 2006 study by Dr. Ian Walker from Bath University:

&gt;The study found drivers tend to pass closer when overtaking cyclists wearing helmets than those who are bare-headed. ...

&gt;""We know helmets are useful in low-speed falls, and so definitely good for children, but whether they offer any real protection to somebody struck by a car is very controversial."" [said Walker] ...

&gt;However, a spokesman for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents insisted: ""We wouldn't recommend that people stop wearing helmets because of this research. Helmets have been shown to reduce the likelihood of head and brain injuries in a crash.

If you are not an expert (I would presume you are not) then don't try to be clever in checking the car out. Any seller must tell you about any known fault that they have no reason to expect that you would find out. If you set yourself up as an expert then that limits that protection.

The result would be exactly the same *on average*, except spread across everyone rather than dumped on the people who happen to get unlucky and become ill.

But there's no reason you can't have a safe pension pot, and also private investments as well that you expect to appreciate through good investment choices. Many pension funds have a requirement that they can't invest in anything with a risk rating lower than a certain threshold.

This means that 'riskier' investments with ratings below these thresholds has less access to capital, which means the return on those investments on aggregate is higher - because as an individual you can be more risk tolerant.

Though obviously you will lose money as well due to bad investments - so you will need to diversify, which if you have a small amount of capital to invest means that the proportion of your gains lost by transaction fees of buying may increase.

People putting their pension money into risky assets are basically gambling with their own future. If they win: they get a bumper, wealthy retirement. If they lose: they struggle to make ends meet through retirement (or more realistically, lobby the government to provide more help for the retired).",0,1384877375,null,0,false,0,cdi0g1g,t3_1qyxpx,t1_cdi0g1g,t1_cdhzlyx,null,1428595849,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

They have benefits - but does the benefit outweigh the risk? If it benefits in a certain limited group of crashes, but generates significant risks in general, then which is the more sensible safety choice?


Wearing a helmet puts cyclists at risk, suggests research

http://www.bath.ac.uk/news/articles/archive/overtaking110906.html

Look at Austrialia and mandatory helmet laws.

http://cyclehelmets.org/1241.html

""Comparisons of pre- and post-law injury data (Figs 1-5) show that there is little benefit to either cyclists or  the community from passing laws forcing cyclists to wear helmets.  Rather than encouraging cyclists to wear  helmets, the laws appear to have discouraged cycling, resulting in reduced health and fitness, but very little  change in %HI. If the money spent on helmets had been used for other measures e.g. improving accident  blackspots for cyclists, the benefits would have much been greater.

**More importantly, risks per cyclist seem to have increased, compared to what would have been expected  without the law, implying that helmet laws are counter-productive.**  Possible explanations include risk  compensation, reduced ‘Safety in Numbers’ and that brain damage is predominantly due to rotational injury.

Who the fuck put him in charge of telling married couples what they need to talk about? While I'm sure his rich millionaire marriage to Sam Cam is 100% dreamy with totally no problems about lying or anything like that, it's not his or the government's place to dictate to others how to be married.

To actually answer your question, if the movement goes through and become law it wont be repealed by anyone. Repealing laws is something both major parties wont do as it just sets precedent, you repeal our law, I'll repeal yours when I'm back in office etc.

If someone were to organise a movement against this, then it would need to be direct to two sources:

1) Your local MP telling them you will not only not vote for them if they vote in favour of the bill, but you'll actively campaign against them. Really explain to them your concerns in the letter and make a comparison to films (you can still buy DVDs and leave them lying around the house for example, same with PCs). 

2) Your ISP telling them if they ever put in place a filter on something that is not illegal to view, you will immediately cancel your service with them.

3) Write to Ed Milliband saying that you are hoping to see him fight the Tory ""moral"" crusade on liberties, and as an undecided voter Labour's stance on privacy will determine whether you are voting for them in the next election or not. Then do the same thing with Nick Clegg.

The point of doing 1 is to try and get some MPs resisting the bill, and talking it down. The majority is not huge in the Commons and if enough Lib Dems and Tories say they will vote against it the chances are Cameron will back down as so far that's what he's done with everything that wasn't a dead cert.

The point of doing 2 is to try and make them think they will have huge cancellations if the government passes this law so they will try and fight the government.

The point of doing 3 is to try and make the other 2 parties think there are votes in standing up against this. 

If the law goes through the only way to fight it would be to basically sue the government and say the law is illegal, which costs a lot of money so there would need to be some sort of fundraising campaign to cover the legal costs or you would have to find a legal firm willing to content it pro bono.

Bear in mind that the last case that the ISPs fought the government on  was the Pirate Bay blocking and the Judges (who are equally out of touch with technology) ruled in favour of the government. So while I would like to think the likes of BT etc will come to our resuce, they probably wont.

&gt;How much of the change in opinion about war do you think is down to WWI coinciding with the birth off mass media? I think people at home being clearly able to see the realities of war had a huge impact.

The Great War doesn't really have much in the way of mass media showing the true horrors. Most of what we know comes from the letters home and the diaries kept. Lord knows they didn't talk about it when they came home. We'd need to wait a lot longer before mass media had the freedom to report what they saw and not what the top brass wanted them to report.

In Korea, we had a news crew with us for a while. During this time the ground was so frozen, we couldn't bury the dead and they lay piled up upon each other.

Ah, didn't know that.

Taken from [Honest John](honestjohn.co.uk)

Buying Ford Fiesta 1.25 16v mk4/5
Based on my experience:
Watch for
stone chips/rust round rear wheel arch/petrol cap (bad!) and especially passenger side rear post in front of rear door.
Rust behind rubber seals on front door apertures: on top and going down windscreen side.
Rust in door seams

Leaking suspension struts and clonks on rough roads due to rubber bushes wearing.

Check antifreeze is clean and red - no oil. Check radiator for leaks or oozing antifreeze.

Engine must be cold when testing it. If it is warm, leave for at least 30 minutes for all oil to drain away and then start it up with bonnet open. Any rattles means wear- walk away.

If oil is very black/thick and no service history - likely bearing/cam damage.. = new engine.

If serviced by non-Ford garage person, try to find what type of oil used. Ford use 5/30 - a 20/50 is NOT suitable and will lead to cam wear at start/sticking valves or both. DO NOT buy if wrong oils have been used.



Some clutch noise (release bearing) at idle is common. Should go when in gear. Any noises when on move from gearbox? Run away.

As mentioned before, water leaks in passenger side due to faulty door seals or from incorrectly sealed bulkhead.

Check rear wiper and heated rear window work.. cables can snag.

Watch for kerbed wheels or alloys.

Spare wheel tray can and does rust.. examine carefully plus spare wheel.

Check for exhaust rust and recent MOT to see emissions ok (read report). A new cat is £££.

If it has a sunroof and air, check both work and air is cold (in winter use heater full on to heat car and then switch to max cold. It will be slow to cool but it should) Regassing costs £50plus.. but a aircon failure may be much more...

All electrics should work - check front heated screen.

There should be NO oil leaks.

I would take overalls and a garden kneeler and peer underneath with a torch - many can be very rusty due to neglect/salt.

I have a 1.6 Ghia with all mod cons and it's a super car to drive...both in town and on open road. Do several reverses/forwards on full lock both ways to check driveshafts/bushes. Drive over rough roads to see suspension has no clonks. Accelerate hard in 2 and 3 to 6,000 rpm.(when engine warm) Engine should be very smooth and responsive. ANY misfire - walk away as could be plugs/ leads or valves etc.

They are very reliable and strong but some people can abuse anything hence my comments.

I like a lot..

true,turkeywelder,eng-manchester,Monkchester,"As everyone else has said /r/ukpersonalfinance is a good start, but here's some things that might help (I'm not a financial adviser, but I take a personal interest in finance)

- Any money paid into any scheme has the benefit of compound interest, so the longer it sits there, the better your chances of having more when you retire.

- Some schemes allow you to transfer the pension contributions out if you've not worked there long and get a new job (example is at work if we've paid in for less than 2 years and move, we can either leave it or take it out as a lump).

- Most schemes give you the option of leaving the investing choices up to the fund manager or taking a little more control and choosing the funds yourself.  If you want even more control, you can get a SIPP and do it all yourself, but you might miss out on Employer contributions - you'd need to check.

Personally, I'm paying the maximum contribution in that my employer will match (which is 7%, so 14% in total) and putting more away on my own (£50 at the moment, more in the future) as a backup in case the pension fund isn't big enough or I fancy a lump some before retirement.  

Bear in mind that in the majority of cases, you're building up enough money to buy an annuity at the end, rather than getting the money you've saved up back in lumps.  Depending on the annuity situation when you retire, you might need loads of cash, or (relatively) small amounts.  This will be dependant on the pension situation at the time, the value of the investments and how the annuity markets are at the time.  One thing is for certain, the bigger your pension pot, the more choice you have at the end.

Either way, anything you pay in now will benefit the pot more in 20 years.  If you're 24 now and get in, then you're in a lot earlier than people I know - so you only stand to benefit.  Pensions aren't set in stone, you can reinvest them, transfer them and consolidate them to cut down on charges, so at this age you'll do no harm by enrolling into ANY scheme, it's better than no scheme.

If your company has multiple schemes (ours has the government auto enrol and a Plus scheme for employees who enrolled in the pension scheme before the government one came about), then compare the contributions for both of them.  Your employer should be able to provide all the paperwork for the schemes and one Sunday morning you can decipher most of the pros and cons with MoneySavingExpert open and lots of tea + biscuits.  

Hope that helps,

Doing a little bit of research, there's no absolute need for a contract, but it can be bad for both sides if there isn't one. I would personally walk from a job if I wasn't given a contract to sign in the first week. From the jobs I've had, it has either been sent out before I arrive or on the first day of the job. 

This kind of highlights how important it is to do some research about a company before you accept any offer. Some people are always going to get burned (has to be a first time!), but it can help avoid grief from scam job offers. 

As annoying as it is, I think the best way of answering your question would be to contact the job centre and explain the situation, and maybe see if you can get some legal advice on the situation, but it'll cost you. If not, you might want to see if one of your coworkers can afford it, and pass on their findings to other people to see if legal representation is worth it.

The Silence, though, would merely need to maintain vision of it while walking out of the Angel's field of view.

ANY MONEY YOU SAVE WILL SIMPLY DETRACT FROM THE BENEFITS &amp; STATE PENSION YOU WILL RECEIVE &amp; MAY MAKE YOU ELLIGIBLE FOR COUNCIL HOUSING, FREE PRESCRIPTION &amp; OTHER BENEFITS LIKE WINTER FUEL ALLOWANCE.

Either way a pension is pointless unless you are making large amounts of money or are already well off putting you above the state pension with savings over 300k not including property up to 1M. Some work places will have double matched schemes where you might be worth while paying into ie you pay 1% they'll add 2% bringing you up to 3% but even then it could loose all its value and it's even loosing out to inflation now.

If you are an average Joe like me earning less than £50k per annum then I'd advise not paying into a pension but instead paying off your mortgage ASAP on a property less than the state pension &amp; benefit ceiling which changes depending on how broke the government is and how many people they want to rob. 

If you pay off your mortgage then put the rest into premium bonds £30K max per person as they are government guaranteed unlike any pension scheme, you will loose out to inflation in the worst case. You are entitled to hold £30K in trust for your children &amp; grand children so if you have 2 children and they go onto have 2 children then you could hold £180,000 in premium bonds with your spouse so that is almost 200 K government guaranteed and you have the small chance of turning it into millions.

Potential Buys: (Not all obviously, just who I would try and get).

 - DEF: Fabio Coentrao, Alaba, Mangala, Thiago Silva
 - CDM: Matuidi, Daniele De Rossi
 - CAM: Hernanes, Marchisio, Koke
 - ST: Benzema, Ibrahimovich, Falcao, Lewandowski

Potential Sell/Loan/Drop: 

 - Ba, Luiz, Torres, Essien, Cahill, Cole, KDB, MVG, Hilario, Bertand.

I know that those last 10 players are liked and loved (by me inclued, Essien, Ba and Luiz mainly), but you've stated that we only have £40,000,000 - And I'd need to spend at least £80,000,000 to bringing in some of those players from the list and drop a few (I have to raise it from somewhere, and I'm not going to sell Mata, Lukaku or Ramires).

Obviously I'd only sell some of those above if a serious offer came in, and I'd really try my hardest not to sell KDB, Luiz, Cahill or MVG, but the players you could potentially buy from that list above would outweigh the loss.

I honestly think with a few key players from around the world (lets say we bought Benzema, De Rossi, Silva and brought back Lukaku), we'd be a scary scary team to play against - But we'd potentially need a new formation, and I don't see any problem in changing formations when you have the players like we would do.

It's here where I have issue with you.  I have no issue of your OPINION, but you apply your OPINION to something which you seem to believe is inevitable.  AI #s in UK are still just as good under RTD.  Viewing #s are still as good as RTD - the main exception being End of Time (amongst the worst piece of Who trash ever, but amazingly I don't make the ""claim"" that RTD RUINED WHO.) and Voyage of the Damned.  

So again, besides your opinion, how can you make such an ""inevitable"" claim that ""Moffat has ruined"" Who when everything is contrary to what you are saying?

Awards?  Please...  when you have a show that's been running now for 8 years, YOU CAN""T EXPECT TO WIN ALL THE AWARDS.

Awards can't continually be won, and to be fair many of the years after '09 had Doctor Who competing against itself. It was inevitable that they wouldn't win simply b/c the incompetition.  That said, what the heck do awards have anything to do with the quality of the show?  If Awards were the barometer, then why didn't Breaking Bad win best Drama this year?  I guess Breaking Bad is a complete and utter failure... right?

Bringing up Rose/Martha vs Amy/Rory/Clara is again bringing in your own opinion rather than reality.  I can't see how Moffat's characters vs. RTD's have any bearing on whether or not Who is ruined.  Again... Hyperbole.

""The acting is just as good as it ever was, the writing and actual direction of Doctor has gone downhill, and that's down to the showrunner. Moffat can write a good story once a season, but he just isn't fit for showrunner.""

We have to agree to disagree.  I think Moffat's era is far improved over RTD's.  I've yet to find a comparison to Love and Monsters or Journey's End or ""Last of the Time Lords"" (unwatchable SHIT imho) or the utter disaster ""End of Time"" where we have a whiney ass Doctor instead of a hero.  But guess what, I still don't think RTD RUINED Who.  RTD saved Who and I'll always thank him for bringing it back.

Again.. Hyperbole.

""I agree that my original statement that he's ruined Doctor Who was a little brash, but the series have dropped in quality and in my opinion, with the 50th Anniversary and chance they might reveal his name, he's messing with the fundamental things behind Doctor Who. If they reveal his name, the whole idea behind the show's name, in my opinion, is ruined.""

They are not going to reveal the Doctor's name.  I have no idea why you actually believe that would happen.  Maybe Moffat's hype machine is working on you better than you're realizing?  

Messing with the fundamentals?  Ummm.  where?  Because he brought forward  a ""mystery Doctor?"" Really?  What about the Dream Lord or the Valeyard?  Oh noes!!!!  

Again... OPINION. Learn the definition of the word.

Ultimately, the #s tell the whole truth.  Moffat's Who is just as watched as RTD.  Interest #s are just as high as under RTD, AI #s are just as strong as '05 to '09.  So, again, not seeing how Moffat has ruined Who.  

It seems like more that you just don't like Moffat's Who.  THat's ok, but quit saying that he's ruined Who.  Because guess what, Moffat won't be the showrunner forever - that's the beauty of the show - you'll be able to enjoy Who (hopefully again) under some other showrunner.",0,1384882493,null,0,1384883084,0,cdi2p2o,t3_1qz3cz,t1_cdi2p2o,t1_cdi2k7w,null,1428594799,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

The main argument against circumcision were presented in 1949. It took a a while for this to be rolled out across the whole NHS. 

Argument presented;

 Douglas Gairdner wrote a paper in the British Medical Journal attacking the routine performance of circumcision on the grounds that (a) the foreskin was still naturally fused to the glans until about 3 years of age and hence inability to retract it was no grounds for removal before the age of 5; and (b) a small number of boys died from the procedure each year. However, what he failed to point out (and was thus less than honest about) was that (1) not all circumcisions were recorded in any sort of official statistics and hence the proportion of boys who suffered complications was only a fraction of what his paper implied; and (2) all the deaths had been from the use of general anesthetics - which are normally contra-indicated for newborn babies - and were, anyway, mostly of old fashioned types.

So to begin with, if you wanted, you could have your child cut at birth on the NHS. After a few years most administrators of the NHS refused to pay for this to be done and it became a ""service"" you would have to seek out privately.

This however wasn't enough. When some religious groups have enough numbers in an area, and I'm talking about today here, circumcision will be offered.

Now we have an understanding of the pressure on the NHS it is interesting to note that in the 50's most cuts were made for medical reasons. Prevention of UTI's was the most common given. Sadly people thought it was common sense to make a preventative step.

There are also class issues involved. If you felt you were higher up the food chain then your children should be cut because it showed that you were on top of everything in life.

On the face of it this all seems appalling but the UK has one of the lowest rates of circumcision for young boys and has done for quite some time.

Sorry If my first comment misled you. Should have said ""a lot"".

In effect though, because BT own the vast majority of copper and fibre that connects to the exchanges, we just rent that part off them and hook it into our kit. I seem to remember Bulldog Comms leading the way on this ""Local Loop Unbundling"". It's actually a lot easier to use BT for new copper and fibre runs too but sometimes Virgin or C&amp;W get a look in.

Hull was always the grand experiment with an alternative provider. Hence Kingston Communications, Kcom, KC.

Also Moffat won't reveal The Doctor's name, he knows how fundamental that is to the show. Remember he is a huge DW fan.

I'm a big fan of how Moffat is changing things up, you can't keep the show running for 50 years and have everything the same, eventually you gotta do something different. There's nothing wrong with the secret regeneration, it's possibly the best thing they can do with this anniversary episode.

You are absolutely fair on this and agree with you.  However, my point was that ""alternative"" images of the Doctor has presented themselves in the past - most people today have no issues with them, but I'll concede your point on this.

As for the numbering issue?  I have no issue with it, and in fact am intrigued by it.  Not sure why the confusion as the name ""Doctor"" is also (in a ways) a title.  Note: I'd argue this idea actually comes from RTD and not Moffat (see ""Sound of Drums"" scene between Master and Doctor over the phone).  With this in mind, since the ""War Doctor"" doesn't assume the title of the ""Doctor,"" he's not amongst the ""numbering"" of the Doctors.  Not sure why that's such a brain tease for some of y'all, but to me it makes 100% sense.

true,Valarsis1,crest,,"Liverpool is second on the table after losing the big game against Arsenal. Morale is down around the club and Brendan Rodgers is worried, so he calls Arsene Wenger and gets himself invited to a Gunners training session, to try and identify what makes them such a strong team.

Rodgers watches proceedings but cannot find the secret weapon.
So Rodgers asks Wenger what the difference between the two teams is.
Wenger replies: “It's just that our players are a more intelligent breed.
“They can put their brilliant minds to work on the field. I will give you an example.”
Wenger calls over Mikel Arteta and asks him a question: “A person is your father's son, but it's not your brother. Who is it?”
Arteta thinks for a second and then replies, “It's me!.”
Thereupon Wenger turns to a smiling and nodding Rodgers and says, “You see.”

Rodgers drives back to Liverpool and straight to his training session.
He calls over Steven Gerrard.
“Stevie, answer me this question: 'A person is your father's son but it is not your brother, who is it?'”
Gerrard stands there floundering and finally gives up. “Dunno, Boss.”
Rodgers is disappointed but does not want to give up.
“Steven, you have a night to think about it. Come and tell me the answer tomorrow.”
Gerrard goes away and thinks as hard as he can, all to no avail. So he calls his teammates. Alas none of them had any ideas however.

Gerrard drives home and asks his wife the same question, but of course does not get an answer.
So he is sitting in his living room mulling over the question when he decides to call his old friend and former team-mate Jamie Carragher. “Hi Jamie, answer this question: A person is your father's son but it's not your brother, who is it?”
Carragher asks for time to think about it and calls him back two hours later and says “It's me!”
Gerrard says “Oh yeah, of course!”

Next day at training Rodgers approaches a smiling Gerrard and asks him, “So, Steven, a person is your father’s son but it's not your brother, who is it?”
“It's Jamie Carragher!” declares Gerrard.
“No you idiot,” says Rodgers, “it's Mikel Arteta!”

We have very detailed knowledge of the economic position of Jews in 1930s Germany, because their assets were systematically confiscated by the Nazis, who naturally took exact account of how much they had plundered.

&gt; In total, German and Austrian Jews reported 8.5 billion Reichsmarks in gross assets &amp;ndash; 7 billion net out outstanding liabilities. Of this considerable sum, only 1.19 billion Reichsmarks were active business assets. Allowing for the fact that the net wealth of Austrian Jewry was reported as just over 2 billion Reichsmarks, it is unlikely that Jewish business capital in Germany far exceeded 850 million Reichsmarks. This was, by any count, **a small proportion of the total assets at work in the German economy.** Aryanization undoubtedly changed the complexion of major shopping streets in cities like Berlin and Hamburg, and it also changed the structure of property ownership in some highly visible residential neighbourhoods. But its wider impact was limited. Only in a handful of sectors did it cause a major shift in ownership, most notably in retail, particularly in department stores, textiles, clothing and private banking. In general, **the idea that the tiny Jewish minority had ever occupied a 'dominant position' in the economy ... should be seen for what it always was &amp;ndash; an absurd anti-Semitic myth.**

Vehicular traffic is essential for modern large cities, and the space available must be shared responsibly. All you can do is disincentivize unecessary car journeys - but this begins to encroach on personal freedom if you are not careful.

Using freight tunnels (a la Chicago) and BRT tunnels (a la Seattle) might seem like a good idea on paper to reduce surface traffic - but these are extremely expensive, and practically impossible.

I believe that shielding bike lanes with kerb stones would be a cheap and effective solution if implemented correctly - cheaper than painting the CS routes in the first place.

From my reading it seems pretty clear that wearing a helmet is more safe than not. Using earphones does not seem *conclusively* statistically less safe than not, so I find it strange that a ban on earphones should be considered before e.g. a ban on cycling without a helmet.

Again, in my opinion, neither wearing a helmet nor not using earphones should be mandatory.

Is that unreasonable? The Conservative party and David Cameron in particular almost seems like he's waging a personal war against the Internet.

The larger tide of change is one against the traditional freedoms that the Internet has enjoyed until now: we're seeing a slow erosion of net neutrality in many countries (not just the UK) and of course the continuing revelations about spying on Internet traffic by the NSA and GCHQ. Perhaps this all seems like the demented ramblings of a conspiracy theorist to you; to me this one small change is a microcosm of a larger tide of changes that is making the Internet a much less free place.

&gt; I don't think the crucial bridge is crossed by an opt-out filter implemented by the major ISPs

While I do see the point you're getting at, the important thing is that these changes don't happen as a big change, but rather as a number of small changes. Perhaps this doesn't seem such a big deal now, but when the ""crucial bridge is crossed"", that'll be another small change that won't seem so unreasonable either.

added the element that the doctor was deliberately travelling in a ""much more fun"" time machine.

true,goneforaburton,lancashire,Lancashire,"&gt; Hmm well I would have agreed with you. Personally I never understood how ""crash for cash"" was a crime - because everybody should be following at a safe distance anyway.

Well, if someone pulls out in front of you and slams on, has their brake lights disabled or any of the other tricks involved in that particular aspect of cash-for-crash then it is a crime - it's fraud at the very least.


&gt; But the media was pretty convincing that tailgating motorists were the victims...

As above - if you're tailgating then you're on dodgy ground, but if it's running into the back of someone who's disabled their brake lights and then braked sharply you'll have a much easier time arguing your case.


&gt; I still don't understand how my car insurance premiums went up though.

Because cash-for-crash is insurance fraud. The risk the premiums were calculated on didn't take this fraud into account, therefore premiums went up to cover the additional risk that now exists for everyone.


&gt; Oh and when will cyclists start paying out premiums?

I imagine cyclists will start paying premiums when it's a legal requirement. Just like motorists do now.

And after we exhausted the ""check the line's OK"" script , BT then asked me to prove the router was indeed at fault by, er, swapping out with another (which I'd have to supply at my own expense) and only if that one worked OK would BT consider shipping out a replacement.

They tend to follow the same high-level criteria as the local authority (i.e. in catchment, out of catchment, siblings in school etc) but if there are too many applicants who meet the same LA entry priority they can apply a religious test and base entry on that.

So if you have 30 places and 35 applicants who are all in-catchment you can give a preference to church-going families and they will get a place over non-attendees. 

Here's the text from a local CofE primary school near me in Warwickshire:

&gt;**Priority within each criterion will be given where children and at least one parent can demonstrate regular attendance at:**

&gt; a) All Saints Parish Church or St Andrew’s Parish Church
 
&gt; b) A mainstream Christian church. (eg a church which is a member of Churches Together in Britain and Ireland). A copy of the list of churches may be obtained from school. 

&gt; c) A mainstream faith represented in the Inter-Faith Network of the UK other than those  included in a) and b) above. 

&gt; d) Other children, where no faith commitment is evidenced 

&gt; **5.3 Regular attendance** 

&gt; A letter will be required from the faith leader confirming evidence of Christian or other faith commitment on the basis of a minimum of 2 attendances a month for at least 12 months preceding the application for a school place for categories a) b) and c) above. 

&gt;The evidence of regular attendance should be based on a register maintained by the religious organization concerned, and the letter is to be provided at the time of application.

The logical corollary of it is that *any system of values* is based on unjustified assumptions, and the closest you can get to saying what you ""should"" do are statements called theoretical imperatives, like ""If murder is bad, you should not murder."" or ""If dying is bad, I should avoid dying."" But these statements will never evaluate to true.

In other words, even if you want to say something like ""I'm hungry, I should eat"", you have to include a value judgment like ""I'd prefer to live"" to make the deduction to ""I should eat"". That value judgement is ultimately not based on objective reality, it's based on personal, subjective judgments based on your own perspectives and understanding of the world, but ultimately you cannot logically justify those.

This means that we all have deep seated articles of faith (Defining faith as a belief we hold despite or even against a lack of evidence) that we simply cannot justify, and without them, we have no motivation or reason to do *anything at all*. In other words, if you removed all articles of faith from humanity, we'd all sit around and starve to death.

Each person writes three things down, one is a truth about them, one is a lie about the person to their right, one is a lie about the person to their left. They crumple the papers so that someone can't tell which one they wrote, and pass the lies to the two people next to them. So now each person has three crumpled bits of paper, two lies and one truth.

Each person goes around in turn and reads one of their papers, and the rest of the group guesses if it is a lie or the truth. The people next to the person who is reading have a 50:50 chance (they know one lie is a lie) and everyone else has a 1/3 chance.

You get a point for guessing the true story. They game works well if you know your group moderately well. If you play it with family members who are close, it can be a bit predictable.

That covers the concepts of putting money with folks who know what they are doing, avoiding games/Lotteries, allocating out income and beyond all else, the effect of snowballing (and how small percentages compounded over the years have a major difference in what you are left with at the end).

The general rule is that, over all the history of stock markets (and in spite of crashes along the way), over the long term, betting on all the horses (with an index tracker) performs better than anything else. Because this is a fairly mechanical process, charges are fairly low (0.25-0.75% per year) and you have very little in the way of trading costs to pay. It's Long Term Buy and Hold.

There is a fallacy in the industry that folks are doing you a favour by managing your fund and trading in and out based on their superior expertise. In fact, they charge more, spend money in transaction costs as they move assets around, and historically have performed worse than even random monkey picks of stocks to hold.

In my own experience, you stick your money away in a 100% equity index tracker long term, and then start stepping the percentage down to go more into government debt (bonds) in the last 10 years (more steady but much lower returns). Personally, most of my own pension is sitting in Vantage LifeStrategy 100% Equity Accumulating Index tracker units. The Accumulating part just means that any dividends paid are reinvested in buying more units. In a couple of years time, I'll start stepping that down into 80%, 60%, 40% then 20% equity.

This year so far, I'm up over 7%. It will ebb and flow both ways, but in the long term, I'll be much better off than leaving it with folks who charge over 1% per year. To put it into context, I'm paying less than 0.5% costs where this outfit, at 1.8%, would be helping themselves to £5,562 of my money. I'd rather have the £4,000 delta in my future pocket rather than in their mits. And of course, compound interest means I live on the interest, it's children, it's grandchildren and so so forth in a nice ever bigger snowball.

Any questions, there is good advice on the Motley Fool, but in the final analysis, you need to make the call yourself. I have experience with my own money but am not qualified to give advice outside of that.

I never saw the show so can't comment on it particularly, but I can see why people get confused in this case as the wounded man was a threat prior to being shot by the helicopter and then suddenly he wasn't. 

That's because rules of engagement can be confusing, even to the soldier on the ground. Plus there were mitigating circumstances regarding how the Taliban treated the wounded that they captured (hanging body parts from tree's etc) causing a great deal of resentment.

However, our following of the Geneva Convention is what separates us from them. These boys lowered themselves to the level of the men they considered not worthy of medical care, so they lost any moral argument and that's the part some reactionary people don't understand.

I appreciate that the pay rise may be a while away, but I would be inclined to believe that when you took this role on you expected to be waiting a while before your wage went up anyhow. Comparing wages and working on that basis is not a good way to ensure job security. Granted being asked to do a fair bit extra is unfair, but it's all adding to your experience and will in the long run be better for your career development down the line.

In a nutshell, by the sounds of it you are considered a trustworthy member of the team to be asked to train someone up to fulfil another role at the company. Even if you are alone in the role, they have felt it worth trusting you with training, which I think gives you an opportunity to demonstrate your ability. If you are still totally against doing it, the appropriate way to deal with this would be to tell the person who asked you to train them that you don't feel comfortable training someone because you don't feel your knowledge is sufficient to handle it.

I apologise that what I have said doesn't read too nicely. I think it's great you want to work in something you enjoy and it's unfortunate that your current situation is restricting your enjoyment.

These statistics go on CVs to prospective employers which shows off your potential ability. It makes up for an absence of experience to a degree.

In terms of your job in a supermarket, to strengthen your CV, I advise highlighting any times you have held personal responsibility for something with regards to paperwork or assisting a customer.

A lot of admin roles involve customer contact in some sense. You want to demonstrate you can handle that whilst at the same time ideally show you know how to operate in a working environment structured around routine. Working to targets is another big thing admin roles like. Also, anything with taking telephone calls helps. If you have any experience working in an office in the shop at all, even if it's just cashing up tills, you can add that.

If you feel your skills in Excel and Word are lacking, I recommend you jump on Youtube and have a look around at tutorials. If you can ace an evaluation and you seem pretty clued up on the software, the agency workers who took you on will be more keen on getting you out there.

Most people use more than one vehicle for retirement savings, an ISA offers flexbility, but less returns. A mixture is key here. The idea of locking in money into a pension is pretty outdated and leaves you exposed to the whims of the government. Who knows what they will do in the future?

With regard to how it will be managed, it depends on what your employer uses. Personally we have been updated, I get a login page like a basic account manager, I can change contribution amounts on the fly and choose what funds to invest in, and the annual charges are reduced through my employer. If you change funds you will often have to pay a fee, and if you do stop employment with that employer, the annual management fees may rise quite high. You may also get hit with fees if you stop putting in money. Go with your employer, you will most likely get offered a ready made set of risk portfolios, or if its modern, the choice to pick your own funds.

With regards to the training, if you have been doing it a year and you don't feel you know everything, I would say it is unrealistic to expect you to be able to train someone new up to your standard in a short time span.

I think ideally you need to talk to the person who asked you to do the training and explain that it basically isn't going to be a quick and easy job to train someone up as you don't have the experience to be training someone. You should get one of two outcomes - if they tell you that it takes as long as it takes, then you have the easier option and you can start off on the really basic things and build up from there over however long it takes. If they tell you that it's an urgent priority and they want it done in a certain amount of time, you probably would have to draw up a rough plan of what you want to show her and when, get her to learn those bits then let her be responsible for asking you for help when she needs it. If you show someone how to do something and they don't ask for help if they are doing it wrong, that isn't your fault.

What is important is that you communicate across that you aren't totally sure you can train someone else. It can be pretty awkward depending on the technical ability of the person you're training.

If there is one or several owners, who have earned the right to own that business, then it is theirs to do with as they see fit.

true,Quebe,irish,Dublin,"You're right, most small and even medium sized businesses are not a huge problem and they do indeed employee the majority of people in our economy, the issue however is that the large firms, firms that command armies of workers through multiple nations are what define the entire discourse of production for every other firm in the economy even if they don't have direct power over them, and steadily these smaller firms are being consumed by these mechanistically hierarchical titans.

What I'm demanding here is not that everyone gets payed the same thing and we should control everything through some central office, all that I'm demanding is that we don't have this right of dictatorship over our lives based on accumulations of property, that we should all have a fair say in how these giants are operated rather than some class interested in only their own gains.

If people work harder than others they should be reworded of course, it thereby promotes that hard work, if a person is doing a job that requires a long hard education like doctors then of course pay them more, if a person is particularly skilled and we'd like him or her to do a certain job of course it's worth paying them extra for an important position, in the end it benefits all of us, this is the real invisible hand Adam Smith talked about in action.

Rather than some rich kid who networks his way through some privately paid course with other rich wankers later given a position as an executive at which point he promises big short term gains to investors, makes a bundle for them in a year, gives himself a big bonus then they all jump ship to another investment deal, whatever the results may be for the rest of the workers down the line. This is not good for everyone, quite the opposite, all its good for is them and when they all act like this the whole system falls apart every few years.

How about instead of letting the people who own shares in these corporations decide what to do or who runs the business we let the workers make the decisions and if they want vote a manager themselves.

This results in everyone having a grip on how things are run, it results in decisions being made for the long term good of the business rather than short term profit margins and it results in people actually being paid for proper reasons rather than exorbitant executive salaries or the siphoning off of profits to investors who don't even contribute anything while it could be used to reinvest in the business or give workers a better standard of living.

Problem is we live in a society where this mode of production is made impossible, we have an economy dominated by these huge investor run corporations that we have no hope of controlling due to our massive wealth inequality and we have no hope of competing with them due to structural unfairness throughout society from how Loans are given out, to our spurious and arbitrary ~~education~~ ""qualification"" demands, to an unfair taxation system that gives every advantage to those who are already on top.

These men have stole, cheated, plundered and corrupted everything we hold dear, only when we take what certainly does not rightfully belong to them can we have a real system of fair and free enterprise.

This isn't any more Utopian than the people who said many hundreds of years ago ""Having some random bloke called the King ruling everyone don't make much sense does it? How about we holds votes instead?"", these people were called lunatics, heretics and idiots by many back then but look at how we see them now.

true,beard-maketh-the-man,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; People do keep talking about the Dutch cycling infrastructure, but they have been building it for the best part of half a century. Catching up is going to take us a very long time, especially given that due to the design of our cities there will be places where it simply isn't possible to put in separated lanes without a huge cost. 

They made all the effort in design, so now all we have to do is pick the best parts.

People keep talking about the Netherlands as if it doesn't have cities with very narrow streets.  They do.  The simply give priority to the cyclist.  Sometimes removing a lane for cars, or removing them altogether.  But when they have to share, the cars are up their arse.

It's import not to forget that congestion costs each city and town millions each year ([Bristol for example:  Traffic congestion is estimated to cost the Bristol economy £300 – £400 million a year and there's an even greater cost to our health and to the environment.](http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/GEORGE-OUTLINES-VISION-BOLD-ENERGISED-GREEN-CITY/story-20097965-detail/story.html))

It's going to be expensive and hard.  But it needs to be done.  The alternative is more cars, more congestion, more costs, worse health (which in turn costs).

&gt; And there is something else I've noticed when in Holland. Dutch cyclists are far less aggressive than British cyclists, don't take as many risks and generally seem to ride a lot slower. That may well be because British cyclists feel they have to put themselves out there more to stay alive, but it does seem be part of the reason there is a problem.

It's simply because they do not have to rush or keep up with traffic.  They are separated and safe and can simply enjoy riding.

Those that are faster, can still use the roads.

The biggest difference is the attitude in drivers.  because nearly every driver there cycles, so simply won't do all the aggressive moves towards them.

Expanding its mandate to cover domestic communications happened in order to prevent terrorism, which is arguably a form of warfare committed by non-state actors. 

While covering terrorism is only arguably inside their mandate, involving them in regular police activities that clearly are entirely domestic in nature is a huge change.

Which I feel is true.

However people seem to have possibly missed the change in role. He played last season the way Paulinho is playing now.

* Not responsible for defending, but when you can press the opposition if they try an cross halfway.
* Pick the ball up from deep and move it forward at your feet, allow other to move forwards with you.
* Arrive late at the box on attacks to trick the defence.

He plays this role fantastically well.

I, like many others I am sure, thought, blimey wouldn't it be great if against weaker teams we could have two of this guy cruising around slipping through challenges, banging in cut backs and all that.

We tried it, we had him and Paulinho on the pitch together a few times, unfortunately their natural style means they end up doing some kind of chuckle brothers impression, getting in each others way instead of owning the midfield.

Unlike many people here I don't think this pairing should be written off. I think with familiarity it may well bare fruit. I would compare it to the Lampard and Gerrard conundrum for England, many claim this wouldn't work, and indeed it very often didn't work for England. However, Mourinho admits to having tried to sign Gerrard for Chelsea. Now when it comes to this man, whatever your opinions on his character are, I hope we can all admit he is the closest thing to guarunteed success as you can get with a manager, he knows his business. I have diverged, but I hope you get my point.

I think a Paulinho Dembele midfield can work, it may not be until next season when we see it, but I think it will happen, at some point they will find the balance and understanding.

At that pace our grandchildren will still be having this argument. And partly because there just isn't the public desire to see it done, so there is no serious political backing. We've spent decades designing life around the car, which means we not only have to build the cycling infrastructure, we have to redesign our towns and cities around this new infrastructure.


Honestly, if you want to live in a place where cycling is as mainstream as you want, you should probably consider emigrating. They have been talking about a new runway for Heathrow since the 50's.

If the machine were actually vending bitcoins as a UK business entity they would have to collect VAT on the price of a bitcoin.. so basically a 20% markup straight to HMRC. Some people might try it for the novelty, but realistically a service that sells you bitcoins for a 20% markup isn't particularly useful to anyone.

If the machine were operating as an agent of a human UK resident then I guess it could probably operate legally as long as it only sells up to ~£77,000 of bitcoins (the vat reporting threshold?) - so about 220 BTC/year at current prices. Clearly nobody could run that as any kind of business, but it probably works fine to cover temporary bitcoin ATMs setup various bitcoin related events.

Otherwise, the machine would probably have to be some kind of money transmitting 'interface' to an offshore exchange - so it would then need money transmitting licensing. The machine would take your money and transmit it to an offshore venue (which would be a normal money transfer operation not subject to vat) where you would buy bitcoins sans VAT.

Truth be told, I like some of his changes. I love the 1981 intro and theme, I liked Nyssa and Turlough, and I appreciate what he tried to do with the characterization of the Sixth Doctor. But I think he tried to introduce too many changes too soon, especially after viewers had gotten so used to Tom Baker in the role for so long. I've read that Baker's dominance and ubiquitousness cast such a long shadow over *Doctor Who* that even the Davison era never fully emerged. By the time Colin was in the TARDIS, the rot had set in.
